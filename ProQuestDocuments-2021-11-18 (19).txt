Texto completo: Its coffers still full from last year's sale of the Los Angeles Times, Chicago-based Tribune Publishing announced Thursday it will pay a special cash dividend of $56 million to shareholders.
It will be the first dividend paid to shareholders since Tribune Publishing spun off in August 2014 as a stand-alone company and significantly shrinks a cash pile that made it both a potential buyer of other media properties and an acquisition target.
The company, which owns the Chicago Tribune and other major newspapers, had $98.2 million in unrestricted cash at the end of the first quarter, according to financial reports. Between the upcoming dividend payment and other recent expenses, the projected cash balance would be about $25 million.
"Over the past year, we have taken advantage of opportunities to sell assets at favorable prices," David Dreier, chairman of Tribune Publishing, said in a news release Thursday. "The payment of a special cash dividend underscores the company's financial strength and commitment to returning capital to shareholders."
Tribune Publishing completed the $500 million sale of the Los Angeles Times and San Diego Union-Tribune to biotech billionaire Patrick Soon-Shiong in June, leaving it a smaller but virtually debt-free company.
The dividend of $1.50 per share, approved by the Tribune Publishing board Wednesday, will be paid on July 2 to shareholders of record as of June 12.
"This is a way to make shareholders short-term happy," Douglas Arthur, a media industry analyst with Huber Research, said Thursday. "Nothing more, nothing less."
Michael Ferro, who stepped down as non-executive chairman last year but remains the company's largest shareholder, would receive a dividend payment of about $13.6 million. Ferro owns nearly 9.1 million shares, or 25.3% of the company, according to regulatory filings.
Soon-Shiong, Tribune Publishing's second-largest shareholder at about 8.7 million shares, or 24.4% of the company, would receive about $13.1 million.
Tribune Publishing has been involved in merger negotiations with a number of suitors since Ferro, a technology entrepreneur who previously owned the Chicago Sun-Times, became the newspaper company's chairman and largest shareholder in February 2016.
In 2016, McLean, Va.-based newspaper publisher Gannett abandoned a six-month takeover pursuit of Tribune Publishing, then known as Tronc, after funding dried up for the escalating bid. More recently, Tribune Publishing terminated negotiations in December to sell the newspaper chain to California-based McClatchy Co.
Multiple industry sources have said there have been renewed merger discussions this year between Tribune and other newspaper companies, including Gannett, which earlier this month fended off a hostile takeover bid by hedge fund-backed Digital First Media. On Thursday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Gannett recently held merger talks with GateHouse Media.
Tribune Publishing spokesman Tilden Katz declined to comment on speculation regarding potential mergers.
The urge to merge comes as the newspaper industry faces revenue declines and a challenging transformation from print to digital platforms.
Tribune Publishing's clean balance sheet is "unusual" in the newspaper industry, and makes it a potentially attractive merger partner, Arthur said, but the large cash dividend may mean there's no deal in the works.
Tribune Publishing also owns the Baltimore Sun; Hartford Courant; Orlando Sentinel; South Florida's Sun Sentinel; the New York Daily News; the Capital Gazette in Annapolis, Md.; The Morning Call in Allentown, Pa.; the Daily Press in Newport News, Va.; and The Virginian-Pilot in Norfolk, Va.

Texto completo: The quote is attributed to President Harry Truman, and President Ronald Reagan kept it on his desk: “It is amazing what you can accomplish if you do not care who gets the credit.”
It is even more amazing what has been accomplished with the American economy, but Democratic presidential candidates, the media and economists such as Paul Krugman of The New York Times refuse to give President Donald Trump any credit. Recall that it was Krugman, a Nobel Prize winner, who predicted Trump’s election would trigger “a global recession.” One continues to wait in vain for an “I was wrong” statement from him.
The Economist, a center-left British magazine that inclu- des coverage of events in the U.S. and is no fan of the Trump administration, recently published a remarkable editorial that contains gems Republicans should quote between now and the next election. They include a strong rebuke to the contention of many Democrats that “working people” are still struggling and that the improved economy continues to benefit only the wealthiest 1%.
The bleak picture painted by Democrats, the editorial says, “is at odds with reality.” The Economist refers to a worldwide “jobs boom” and (note to Bernie Sanders and others promoting socialism) asserts that, “Capitalism is improving workers’ lot faster than it has in years ... the zeitgeist has lost touch with the data.”
Noting that U.S. unemployment at 3.6% is the lowest in 50 years, the magazine says, “Less appreciated is the abundance of jobs across most of the rich world.”
A more educated population, the matching by websites of jobs to qualified applicants, and, yes, economic stimulus efforts that helped fuel the emergence of economies from the last recession have all contributed to the American economy and many European economies.
Then there is this, which has been the gospel of conservatives for decades when it comes to welfare and its disincentive for many to find work: “... reforms to welfare programs, both to make them less generous and to toughen eligibility tests, seem to have encouraged people to seek work.”
This has forced liberal politicians to shift their focus from the unemployed to the “quality” of jobs. British Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn is quoted as saying, “Our jobs market is being turned into a sea of insecurity.”
“Reality begs to differ,” says The Economist. “Official projections” predict that by 2026, “America will have more at-home careers than secretaries.” Jobs and the skills necessary to fill them are changing, but not so rapidly that workers – and especially younger people – cannot adjust their education and training to match the new requirements.
Wages are rising almost everywhere, and, as the editorial says, tight labor markets “lead firms to fish for employees in neglected pools, including among ex-convicts. ... American wonks fretted for years about how to shrink the disability-benefit rolls. Now the hot labor market is doing it for them.”
This is the argument that conservatives, many Republicans and the Trump administration have been making for some time. Economic growth, not government, raises most boats.
While saying “the jobs boom will not last forever” and that a recession will eventually “kill it off,” the editorial concludes the economic boom “deserves a little appreciation.”
It deserves more than that, and would be more than appreciated if it all happened under a Democratic president. Republicans and the Trump administration should seize on this reality and promote it every day, asking voters if they want to continue with these successful policies or return to low economic growth and fewer jobs.
It is a question Democrats and their policies of higher taxes and reimposed regulations will find difficult, if not impossible, to answer.

Texto completo: USA Today publisher Gannett Co. has recently held merger talks with GateHouse Media, according to people familiar with the matter, a possible deal that would bring together the nation's two largest newspaper groups by circulation.
Gannett—which two weeks ago defeated Digital First Media in a proxy fight and fended off the hedge-fund backed publisher's hostile takeover bid—has also been speaking recently with others about potential deals, including Tribune Publishing Co. and McClatchy Co., the people said.
All the companies have struggled over the past decade with steep advertising and print readership declines. This year, both GateHouse and Gannett have had substantial rounds of layoffs, while McClatchy offered buyouts to hundreds of employees.
A tie-up could help the companies bulk up and trim costs to better weather the brutal environment for local newspapers around the country. A merger would give Gannett a far wider geographic footprint to sell digital advertising through its USA Today network and help speed the companies' reorientation away from print.
Should GateHouse and Gannett reach a deal, the combined company would be the largest U.S. publisher by number of titles and circulation. GateHouse is currently the largest newspaper publisher in the U.S. by number of titles owned, with 156 daily papers and 464 weeklies, most of which are in very small markets. GateHouse also is second in circulation among newspaper publishers in the U.S., behind Gannett.
GateHouse's parent is the publicly traded New Media Investment Group Inc., which is operated by private-equity firm Fortress Investment Group LLC. GateHouse, like Digital First, is known for implementing deep cuts at papers it acquires and consolidating operations into regional hubs.

New Media, whose shares had dropped about 26% so far this year before jumping 4.7% Thursday after the Journal reported on the talks, has a market value of roughly $545 million, compared with $889 million for Gannett. Gannett's shares closed up 1.6%.
It isn't clear how a potential GateHouse-Gannett combination would be structured, and there is no guarantee there will be any deal.
Gannett owns 109 daily newspapers including the Arizona Republic, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel and the Indianapolis Star.
GateHouse has spent close to $1 billion in recent years acquiring dozens of small and medium-size papers around the country. Last year, it bought the Austin American-Statesman, the Palm Beach Post and the Akron Beacon Journal.
Tribune—which owns nine big-city dailies, including the Chicago Tribune, the Baltimore Sun and New York Daily News—had rebuffed a takeover attempt by Gannett in 2016, but rekindled talks earlier this year, The Wall Street Journal previously reported.
Last summer, Tribune sold the Los Angeles Times to biotech billionaire Patrick Soon-Shiong and used the proceeds to eliminate all its debt. At the end of the year, discussions for a deal to merge McClatchy and Tribune fell apart over questions about financing and regulatory hurdles.

Texto completo: COPENHAGEN -- Zarmena Waziri once fought for women's rights in Afghanistan, but now, at age 72, she is a refugee in Denmark living with increasingly advanced dementia -- and is facing possible deportation within weeks.
Ms. Waziri's repeated requests for asylum since November 2012 have been denied by the Danish government, which on May 15 rejected a new review of her case and told her to report to a deportation center on June 4.
Family members and advocates working on Ms. Waziri's behalf say she is a victim of Denmark's increasingly strict asylum policies. The number of refugees granted humanitarian asylum has fallen to just three in 2017, from 72 in 2012 and 223 in 2007.
Her daughter Marzia Waziri, who has been her main caretaker and led the push to persuade Danish authorities to let her stay, said deportation would amount to a death sentence.
"She's in bed 99 percent of the time. She can't do anything," Marzia Waziri said in a phone interview from the city of Aarhus, where she lives in an apartment with her mother and runs a small grocery store.
Ms. Waziri's condition has worsened in the two years since The New York Times first reported on her case. Once able to walk around her daughter's apartment, she chokes because she forgets to swallow her food, wears a diaper and barely recognizes family members, her daughter said. In addition, she has suffered blood clots and is struggling with diabetes and asthma, Marzia Waziri said.
She said she would defy the order and refuse to deliver her mother to the deportation center. "We're not going there," she said. "They will have to come and get her."
Leif Randeris of Danish Immigrant Counseling, who is working on the case on the family's behalf, said the Ministry of Immigration and Integration had sent out 15 to 20 requests for more or updated information in the current appeal, which was opened in 2016. Earlier this year, when the authorities made yet another request, Marzia Waziri said that she had reached her limit.
"They keep on and on and on every three months asking for new information," she said. "I don't want to mail more paper. It's been going on for two years and I'm thinking of this every day. I can't gather more proof."
Inger Stojberg, the country's top immigration official, declined to comment on Ms. Waziri's case.
A key point in the final rejection is a lack of medical documentation for Zarmena Waziri's dementia. Her family has provided a 2016 psychologist's statement saying that she suffers from a "medium severe" state of dementia and that she is "a danger to herself" because of eating difficulties.
The Ministry of Immigration and Integration says that only a doctor's diagnosis is acceptable in cases of humanitarian asylum. As an asylum seeker, Ms. Waziri is not eligible for all Danish health services, so she must pay full price for a diagnosis by a doctor, which her daughter said would cost $ 13,500 -- money the family does not have.
The Red Cross provides health facilities for asylum seekers but does not cover treatment or assessment beyond basic or acute needs, said Eva Singer, the asylum director of the Danish Refugee Council, a nongovernmental organization. Ms. Singer said some refugees were able to find doctors who would do a free diagnosis.
Another point of contention is whether Zarmena Waziri has anyone in Afghanistan to take care of her, which could be grounds for rejection of asylum. Her siblings and children are either dead or have moved abroad, and she has no social network in Afghanistan, her daughter says. But the ministry disagrees: There is a nephew on her deceased husband's side. The family is not in touch with him and says he is a member of the Taliban, which opposes the feminist ideals Zarmena Waziri promoted half a century ago.
It makes the nephew a most unlikely caretaker, but that is not relevant to the case, the immigration ministry wrote in its final decision. They only consider the cousin's "ability" to take care of his relative, not his "willingness," the ministry said.
The years of fighting both her mother's diseases and the tightening rules and bureaucracy have taken their toll on Marzia Waziri. She says she has started to hope for a painless solution to her mother's misery.
"It's a bit evil perhaps, but I hope she dies before June 4, because then she can have some peace," she said. "I'm sorry, but I'm powerless."

Security breaches: Just how vulnerable are we?

Texto completo: Internet security is kind of like your sewage system. You hardly think about it until something goes wrong, and then you can’t think of much else.
But it’s more important than that, of course. Unless you have a smart toilet (it’s a thing; look it up), your bathroom may be one of the few places left untouched by the internet.
The rest of your world is connected in some way, which means it’s vulnerable in many ways.
A car ran into a poll a few blocks from my house last Tuesday. As a result, the internet was off for thousands of people in our neighborhood for several hours. I couldn’t watch TV, talk on my landline or pay my bills online. In the end, the inconvenience was temporary and relatively minor, but it was a reminder of how much we rely on the internet for everyday life.
More startling, I recently received an email informing me that an electronic security key I had acquired to protect my email from hackers contains a flaw. Instead of protecting me, it makes my email more vulnerable.
Worse, I wasn’t sure whether the notice was legitimate or a clever attempt to compromise my security — a confusion that remained until an IT worker at the paper told me it was real and I needed to take action.
Even more startling, an internet provider in Murray was attacked last weekend by a “distributed denial of service,” or DDoS scheme. The attacker demanded $750 in bitcoin to go away, and in the meantime slowed service to a crawl for several hours. The provider, Sumo, told the Deseret News it didn’t pay the ransom, figuring that would only encourage more attacks.
And much more startling than all of these, a security company called Red Balloon recently discovered a flaw in Cisco routers that could allow a hacker to get hold of all the data that flows through it, all while the router would keep telling everyone else it was still operating correctly.
Why is this a problem? The Cisco 1001-X routers are used by businesses, corporate offices and stock exchanges. As Lily Hay Newman wrote for Wired.com, “Given Cisco’s ubiquity, the potential fallout would be enormous.”
Thankfully, the flaw was discovered by a security company, not a nefarious hacker. But experts worry about the fix and the “novel concepts” the flaw may have introduced to people with bad intentions.
If you aren’t getting the point yet, I’ll spell it out for you: The more interconnected our world becomes, the more vulnerable we become. As Phillip Lohaus wrote recently for the American Enterprise Institute, “Since 2015, the number of devices connected to the Internet has increased by nearly 40 percent.” For hackers, this has increased potential targets and ways to exploit weaknesses.
Against this frayed and distressed backdrop, a risk-analysis company called SecurityScorecard released a report a few days ago examining the computer networks of 29 political parties in 11 nations.
By now, most people are familiar with Russian attempts to influence elections in the free world and with their infiltration of servers belonging to the Democratic Party in 2016. The report found that both Republicans and Democrats have improved security since then, but that both parties still are vulnerable to a dedicated hacker — one, say, with the kind of funding a major government could provide.
The Mueller Report confirmed what numerous U.S. intelligence agencies have found, which is that Russia wants to meddle in our elections and disrupt our society in general — something many people can’t seem to emerge from their partisan foxholes long enough to acknowledge.
Younger Americans might be prone to smirk at older people who have trouble navigating the many facets of the digital world. The truth, however, is that few of us, young or old, truly understand it, or its vulnerabilities.
New York Times editorial board member Sarah Jeong compared the Cisco problem to being told the steel beams in the building where you work are vulnerable but “probably OK.” They might fall apart if the wind blows a certain way or the temperature is just right, or then again, they might just buckle. “I’d say this kind of risk is just unacceptable,” she said.
Indeed, it is. It also sounds a lot more dangerous than a sewage system failure, and like a wakeup call for the nation to take cybersecurity more seriously.

Texto completo: BOSTON -- The celebrity chef Mario Batali stepped into a courtroom crowded with reporters on Friday morning and entered a plea of not guilty to indecent assault and battery of a woman he met in a bar here two years ago.
The woman, who had long been a fan of Mr. Batali's, told the Boston police last June that what she intended as a selfie session with the chef in March 2017 turned into an assault when he grabbed her breasts, buttocks and groin, forcibly kissed her mouth and cheeks, and suggested they head to his nearby hotel. The woman is about 30 years younger than the chef, who is now 58.
Although several chefs and restaurant owners have been accused of sexual harassment and abuse since the #MeToo movement spread into the world of restaurants and hospitality in the fall of 2017, Mr. Batali is the only one so far to face criminal charges. If convicted, he could face up to five years in prison and be required to register as a sex offender.
Mr. Batali arrived at Boston Municipal Court on Friday looking much trimmer than before, wearing a blazer, no tie and casual trousers. He had forgone his signature orange Crocs for athletic shoes accented in orange. He used a back entrance, walked into the courtroom and immediately headed into a conference room before returning to the courtroom with his lawyer.
Mr. Batali was allowed to remain free without bail on the condition that he stay away from the woman who accused him. His next pretrial hearing was set for July 12. Asked by the judge if he understood that he would not need to appear at the case's next court date, Mr. Batali answered, "Yes" in a near-whisper. It was the only thing he said during the hearing, which lasted less than five minutes.
The criminal complaint was filed last month, and mirrored the narrative in a civil suit brought against Mr. Batali by the woman, Natali Tene, 29, in August 2018. Three months before she sued, Ms. Tene told the food website Eater that she had been having dinner and drinks at Towne Stove and Spirits, a bar in the Back Bay neighborhood of Boston that has since closed, when she spotted Mr. Batali and took a photograph of him with her phone.
He called her over, suggested they take a selfie, and then proceeded to grope and kiss her, according to her lawsuit and the criminal complaint. Ms. Tene is seeking money damages for emotional distress, anxiety and self-doubt she said she suffered because of the encounter. She was not in the courtroom on Friday.
The two people listed as witnesses on the criminal complaint, reached by telephone on Thursday, said they were surprised that their names had been included in the documents, and declined to comment. One, a friend who was having a drink with Ms. Tene that night, said he had been deposed for the lawsuit, and had repeated his version of events to the police.
Through a lawyer, Mr. Batali denied the accounts in both the civil and criminal complaints. "The charges, brought by the same individual without any new basis, are without merit," the lawyer, Anthony E. Fuller, said in a statement to The New York Times. "He intends to fight the allegations vigorously and we expect the outcome to fully vindicate Mr. Batali."
Mr. Batali is one of many chefs and restaurateurs hit by accusations of sexual assault and harassment in the restaurant industry that began tumbling out in the fall of 2017 in cities like San Francisco, New York and New Orleans.
As more women came forward to tell their stories, some of these men either stepped away from direct oversight of their businesses, saw the size of their empires shrink or found themselves the subject of investigations and lawsuits.
The New York Police Department investigated three sexual assault complaints against Mr. Batali, but a department official confirmed in January that it had closed those investigations because of a lack of evidence and limits imposed by the statute of limitations.
Mr. Batali's behavior first came to public light in December 2017 when four women told Eater that he had touched them inappropriately as part of a pattern of behavior they and others said spanned at least two decades.
Other accounts of Mr. Batali's behavior were revealed in a Times article the next day; several women described incidents of sexual harassment and assault at the Spotted Pig, a favorite Manhattan playground of Mr. Batali's and a number of other well-known chefs, musicians and sports stars.
A dozen employees described incidents in which the owner, Ken Friedman, 56, groped them in public, forcibly touched them in private as he demanded sex or made text requests for nude pictures or group sex. Mr. Batali was an investor in the restaurant and a regular, attending after-hours parties that included public sex and nudity. One server said the staff had nicknamed him "the Red Menace."
Mr. Batali almost immediately stepped away from the daily operations of his businesses, including several high-powered restaurants in New York and Las Vegas, as well as his job as a host of the ABC daytime show "The Chew."
He quickly issued an apology in which he did not acknowledge specific incidents but conceded that "much of the behavior described does, in fact, match up with ways I have acted. That behavior was wrong and there are no excuses."
He later sent a newsletter to fans, saying "I will work every day to regain your respect and trust" and included a recipe for cinnamon rolls that was widely mocked.
Mr. Batali retreated to his home in Northport, Mich. He began trying to repair the damage to his family (Mr. Batali and his wife, Susi Cahn, have two sons) and, for a time, explored the possibility of finding a way back into the food business. Much of his focus was holding on to part of the business he had built with Joe Bastianich, who for 20 years was his partner in the Batali & Bastianich Hospitality Group.
That effort ended in March, when the group bought out Mr. Batali's stake in the business, leaving the chef without a restaurant.

Texto completo: President Trump may wait to decide on issuing pardons for several members of the military accused of war crimes until after their trials.
Trump faced pushback after a New York Times report said he was considering issuing pardons for the accused war criminals near Memorial Day ahead of their trials. Trump contradicted the report on Friday and suggested he would wait until after the trials before considering pardons.
"We are looking at a lot of different pardons for a lot of different people. Some of these soldiers are people that have fought hard, long. You know, we teach them how to be great fighters, and then when they fight, sometimes they get really treated very unfairly. So we’re going to take a look at it," Trump told reporters.
"I haven’t done anything yet. I haven’t made any decisions. There’s two or three of them right now. It’s a little bit controversial. It’s very possible that I’ll let the trials go on and I’ll make my decision after the trial," Trump said.iFrame ObjectRep. Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas, a former Navy SEAL, urged Trump to reconsider preemptive pardons for the alleged war criminals.
"These cases should be decided by the courts, where the entirety of the evidence can be viewed. Only after that should a pardon be considered," Crenshaw told National Review.
Navy SEAL Special Operations Chief Edward Gallagher and Army Green Beret Maj. Mathew Golsteyn are two of the servicemen Trump is reportedly considering pardoning. Gallagher is facing roughly a dozen charges, including premeditated and attempted murder and obstruction of justice. His trial is scheduled to begin May 28.
Golsteyn told the CIA he killed a suspected Taliban bomb-maker in 2010 and is charged with committing premeditated murder.

Rich Lowry: Comrade Sanders targets charter schools

Texto completo: Few things offend Bernie Sanders as much as people escaping from command-and-control government systems, even minority students whose parents are desperate to get their kids a decent education.
The socialist wants to turn George Wallace on his head and not block black children from attending traditional public schools, but block them from exiting those schools for something better.
The New York Times wrote a long, devastating report the other day on the then-Burlington, Vermont, mayor’s love affair with the Sandinistas in the 1980s. So many decades later, his reflex is the same: If the Sandinistas wouldn’t favor it, he’s not inclined to like it much either. That goes for charter schools that, yes, are publicly funded, but still too flexible and unregulated for refined socialist tastes.
Over the weekend, Sanders unveiled his education plan. He wants to end for-profit charter schools (about 15 percent of all charters) and impose a moratorium on new public funding of charters, while taking steps to impose a one-size-fits-all regulatory regime on existing charters.
Sanders thus seeks to kneecap what has been an astonishingly successful experiment in urban education because it doesn’t fit nicely within his ideological preconceptions.
That Sanders says he wants to do this to advance the principle that “every human being has the fundamental right to a good education” is hilariously perverse. The comrades will have a good chuckle over that one.
Charter schools aren’t the product of a libertarian conspiracy. They fall short of the vouchers favored by conservatives to allow parents to get access to private schools. Charters receive public money, but have more leeway to develop policies outside the regulatory and union straitjacket of traditional public schools.
Charters had bipartisan support before a Vermont socialist became one of the party’s thought leaders. Bill Clinton won the first-ever lifetime achievement award from the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools. Promoting charters was a hallmark of Barack Obama’s education agenda, and a signature of Cory Booker’s mayoralty in Newark, New Jersey.
Not all charters are created equal. Some don’t serve their students well, especially online charter schools, and the performance of suburban and rural charter schools hasn’t been very impressive. It’s the charter schools in urban areas with the worst traditional public schools that have excelled.
According to a well-regarded 2015 study by Stanford’s Center for Research on Education Outcomes, students in urban charter schools got the equivalent of 40 additional days of math instruction and 28 additional days of reading annually. The numbers for African American students in poverty were even better. Charters in Newark and Boston have seen enormous academic gains.
In New York City, the Success Academy founded by Eva Moskowitz — one of the foremost education reformers of our time — has eliminated racial and economic achievement gaps.
It’s amazing what schools can do when they impose discipline, have the highest expectations and focus with a laser intensity on instruction.
Anyone interested in the education of minority students should seek to build on these oases of excellence, rather than cut them off. But the teachers unions hate charters, and they are a much more powerful potential cadre in the Sanders “revolution” than poor black kids.
Sanders suggests that charter schools somehow increase segregation. This is nonsense, as Jonathan Chait of New York magazine points out. Urban charter schools reflect the segregation of their neighborhoods where they are located — just like traditional public schools do.
The polling shows that minority parents get what Sanders (and white progressives) refuses to understand. A solid majority of black and Hispanic Democrats have a favorable view of charters, while white Democrats have an unfavorable view by a 2-1 margin.
It is doubtful how much of his anti-charter agenda Sanders would be able to enact if elected, since much of the action is at the state and local level. That he’s hostile to these schools should, regardless, redound to his shame.

Germany relinquishing Kafka confidant's papers

BERLIN - German authorities are handing over to Israel a trove of 5,000 documents kept by a confidant of Franz Kafka.

The papers include a postcard from Kafka from 1910 and personal documents kept by Max Brod, which experts say provide a window into Europe's literary and cultural scene in the early 20th century.

Kafka bequeathed his writings to Brod shortly before the author's untimely death from tuberculosis in 1924, reportedly telling his friend to burn them unread.

Instead, Brod published much of the collection, including the novels The Trial, The Castle, and Amerika, while keeping other documents.

Beto O'Rourke repeats lie about immigrants committing less crime than native-born Americans

Texto completo: President Trump’s positions on immigration are so undeniably effective that Democrats running for the presidential nomination are reduced to lying about them.
Take, for example, Beto O’Rourke during a CNN town hall Tuesday night. He made the oft-repeated and false claim that recent immigrants (illegal or not, take your pick) are significantly less likely to commit crimes than anyone born here.
The event started with one of those insipid questions from the audience about “restor[ing] global trust in American leadership.” After O’Rourke gave a winding answer about Trump being an “absolute disaster,” he proceeded to play that tried and true great hit accusing Trump of having called asylum seekers “animals.” (He did no such thing).

He then said that Trump characterized “those immigrants who come to this country as rapists and criminals, though they commit crimes at a far lower rate than those who are born in this country.” The assertion is so counterintuitive that it can’t possibly be taken seriously. But since it’s repeated over and over by Democrats and the news media, it has to be said now: It’s a lie.
You will find a lot of studies that push this claim, and usually those studies are based on the same faulty data. Rarely are those studies forthcoming in admitting a few very important facts that change everything and expose them all as garbage.
First, crimes — especially violent crimes — tend to occur within the same ethnic communities. And immigrants who are victims of immigrant crime, for one reason or another, frequently neglect to report incidents to police out of fear. A 2018 New York Times article, for example, said that from 2016 to 2017, Houston police saw a 16% drop in domestic violence reports, likely because immigrant victims feared that they themselves or someone close to them might be deported. Latinos in the city reporting rape to police also had dropped 40% in 2017 from the previous year.
“Undocumented immigrants and even lawful immigrants are afraid to report crime,” Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo told the paper.
Los Angeles, San Diego, and Denver, cities with high Hispanic populations, saw similar declines in reports of crime to the police, according to the Times.
You can say that this is Trump’s fault since it was his first year in office, but anyone would be kidding themselves to believe that illegal immigrants and legal immigrants with family members residing in the country unlawfully didn’t have the same fear before. They certainly did, even if it intensified with Trump’s election.
Second, the “native-born” in these studies include children born of immigrant parents. That may seem irrelevant, but it becomes significant when the question is about the relationship between immigration and crime. If an illegal immigrant couple comes to the United States and has a child who joins a gang and beats someone, that’s a native-born crime, but it's also a crime that could have been prevented through better immigration enforcement. It would be wise, at least, to compare the native-born to immigrants of the same generations, and to look at crime between generations of native birth in the U.S.
Third, any study aiming to prove that immigrants commit crimes at a lower rate than native-born Americans would need to be adjusted for the number of criminal immigrants who are deported and the number of migrants with criminal records who are apprehended by border authorities. U.S. Customs and Border Protection from fiscal years 2016 to 2018 apprehended nearly 30,000 illegal immigrants who had prior criminal convictions in the U.S. That includes domestic violence, burglary, fraud, drunk driving, homicide, drug dealing, and sexual offenses. Because those immigrants are caught crossing and then quickly deported, and because other immigrants who've committed additional crimes are swept up in raids or deported after serving prison sentences, they don't have the same opportunity to re-offend that American-born criminals have. American-born criminals, after all, cannot be simply sent home or arrested for deportation.
The Migration Policy Institute, using data from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, has numbers of convicted illegal immigrants who were deported from 2008 to 2015. The grand total: nearly 1.5 million. Assuming that all 1.5 million had been allowed to remain in the U.S., recidivism rates suggest that 1.2 million of them would have likely committed another crime. You won’t find that factored into any study.
And even if statistics could prove that immigrants (illegal or not) committed crimes at a lower rate than native-born citizens, what exactly would it prove? There should be zero crimes committed by those not entitled to be in the U.S. in the first place, and those permitted to come legally should be chosen only from those above reproach as a matter of policy. The U.S. already has to deal with its own native-born criminals, it doesn't need to import even a single new one, not even if he or she comes from populations that commit crimes but at a lower rate.
O’Rourke and most of the national media are lying about immigration and its relationship to crime. That tells you everything you should know about how popular Trump is on both issues.

Living in California is a 'moral choice'

Texto completo: The apparent ease of California life, Joan Didion wrote in "The White Album," is an illusion, and those who believe the illusion real live here in only the most temporary way. Didion was speaking at the time about the water crises of the late 1970s, specifically, but the truth is that the people of California have always been of pretty hearty stock. You live in a place where the very ground you stand on is, at best, temporary and you recognize that choosing to live here means choosing to live in flux, always a bag at the ready, in case you need to flee. We don't expect empathy from the lattice-work of fault lines, reason from the wild fires, decency from the sun. But we do from the people of the state and, increasingly, that means that living in California is a moral choice.
You have to want California. Now, you may need it, too. Because we'll be the place that defends your liberty, even if you don't live here. We'll be the state that sues for your rights. We'll be the state that fights for your clean air. It may be too expensive to live here; it may be too ethically taxing to live anywhere else.
When Alabama outlawed abortion in the most craven and punishing fashion last week, it was no surprise in a functional sense. Red states have been cutting into women's rights at a shocking pace since 2016, abetted as they are by a White House whose brand is cruelty. Alabama's Constitutional overreach was meant to illicit lawsuits, meant to force Supreme Court action, meant to dehumanize and scare women, to let them know that the government can and will demand control of their bodies. Before that, it was Georgia. After that, it will be Missouri. And then ... and then ... and then, the center indeed not holding, nor the south.
The obvious goal is to overturn Roe vs. Wade, but the long view is even more insidious, which is the systematic removal of human rights (not merely civil) for the most vulnerable segments of our society. We've already seen it with immigrants. We've seen it with the LGBTQ community. We've seen it in the shocking rise of white supremacy in national governance. We've seen it in the flouting of the rules of law from the highest office.
The "free-love" ethos of California may have been well-earned in the 1960s, but five decades on, the result is a state that values personal autonomy but also views our representatives as having the capacity to make life better, to embrace modernity, to fight for equality, not backslide into our worst Puritanical instincts. Thus, the stereotype of going west to find your dreams exists not because life here is easy, but rather because life here isn't about tolerance as much as it is about acceptance. The distance between the two is more than semantic, it is the very fabric of empathy.
I'm not so naïve as to believe everyone in the state shares my values. Nor even everyone in my neighborhood, particularly when my neighbors have a strange tendency to warn me about suspicious people of color doing things like walking down the street, or sitting by the pool, or driving their own cars. But as the country tilts and shivers with the whims of conservative lawmakers, every day a new intentional horror placed upon human beings in the name of greed and public policy, I can't help but think of California as a firewall of basic decency, the last retardant before the flames reach the sea.

Texto completo: The immune system is much less about exercising power than it is about finding balance. You can help train and maintain it. Here are answers to a few frequently asked questions about maintaining a healthy one. MATT RICHTEL
DOES VITAMIN C DO ANYTHING TO HELP KEEP ME HEALTHY?
The false idea that vitamin C is a cold cure-all emerged in the 1960s. To repeat: there is no magic pill to keep you forever healthy. The main thing you can do for yourself is to consume natural nutrients when you are sick, and fluids to replenish what is lost through dehydration owing to fever or to the purging of fluids through, well, y'know. Don't expect a single vitamin or herb to do the trick. One fascinating study done in mice suggests that creatures (mice, humans, etc.) that have viruses do better when they keep up the nutrients; in other words, it may not feel great to eat, but it might help your immune system to get the resources it needs. (The study shows that it may be less beneficial, even harmful, to eat when you have a bacterium.)
IF I KEEP MY IMMUNE SYSTEM HEALTHY, WHY DO I STILL NEED VACCINES?
Vaccines are a proven, effective and generally very safe way of helping the immune system do its job when faced with brutal pathogens. Plus, they help keep these pathogens out of the general population, protecting those with less-hearty immune systems from getting deathly sick.
SHOULD I TRY TO REDUCE A FEVER?
This turns out to be a question that divides very smart people. Dr. Charles Dinarello, who discovered the molecule that causes fever, takes the position that the immune system can get its job done even if you take medicine to reduce fever. "Take the Tylenol," he said. "I tell parents, 'You think this fever is going to help your kid get better faster, but I don't think it is."'
The highly regarded Mayo Clinic, by contrast, urges restraint with fever reducers, encouraging people to wait until the fever rises above 100.4 before treating it. A columnist wrote in depth about this debate for The New York Times, ultimately siding with Dr. Dinarello. So, as you can see, reasonable and wise people differ.

Wildly popular mobile game lets players kill a reporter

Texto completo: The mission is called "Breaking News." It's the seventh mission in the game, and it comes after you've upgraded your sniper rifle to shoot at a distance of nearly 1,000 feet with accuracy.
By now, you've already taken out, among others, a gunman who allegedly killed several people at a pizzeria last year, someone who stole a backpack from a tourist, a sniper who (without a trace of irony) is killing innocent people, and three men guarding a gang's weapon arsenal.
"Breaking News" has a clear goal: kill a reporter.
"A journalist bribed a cop and will pick up a briefcase from the cop," the mission says. "The briefcase is full of sensitive documents. Make him famous in a different way." (In reality, journalists don't pay sources for information or material. There would certainly be no bribing.)
"Sniper 3D Assassin" is a mobile game on iOS and Android. It has a rating of about 4½ stars, with a combined 12 million reviews on both platforms. The app launched in 2014 and reached 10 million downloads in the first month, according to the developer, TFG Co., which is based in Brazil. In 2016, the developer claims it was the most-downloaded game in the App Store.
"Take your sniper, aim and start shooting your enemies," the game description reads.
New York Times editor Jamal Jordan shared an image of the game on Twitter and said his nephew invited him to play. "My nephew is 10, and we had a very long talk after," Jordan told HuffPost.
The Apple Store has guidelines that address violence in games, and it notes that "if you're looking to shock and offend people, the App Store isn't the right place for your app."
Specifically, the guidelines say "apps should not include content that is offensive, insensitive, upsetting, intended to disgust, or in exceptionally poor taste." As examples, the guidelines cite "realistic portrayals of people or animals being killed, maimed, tortured, or abused, or content that encourages violence. 'Enemies' within the context of a game cannot solely target a specific race, culture, real government, corporation, or any other real entity."
Neither Apple nor Google responded to email inquiries. TFG Co., did not immediately respond to an email inquiry.
Attacks and threats against journalists have skyrocketed since 2017, when Donald Trump became president. Trump has continued to call journalists "the enemy of the people," despite criticism and fear that he is stoking tension and violence.
Last June 28, a man shot multiple journalists at the Capital Gazette in Annapolis, Maryland. Five people died and two were injured. Before the shooting, the alleged killer had sent letters to courthouses and a law firm stating: "I further certify I then did proceed to the office of respondent Capital-Gazette Communications ... with the objective of killing every person present," according to the Baltimore Sun.
In October, a pipe bomb was found in the CNN mailroom at the Time Warner Center in New York. The package was addressed to former CIA director John Brennan, who works as an analyst for NBC News and MSNBC.
Charging documents included details suggesting that the suspect was critical of the media. The suspect's van was "covered with images including images critical of CNN," the complaint said.
Trump later told reporters that he didn't think he was responsible in any way for stoking the suspect's rage at the news media. "No, not at all," Trump said. He then attacked CNN on Twitter for suggesting that he was inciting violence against journalists.
The same month, Washington Post contributor Jamal Khashoggi was killed by Saudi government agents. The Post later confirmed that the CIA determined Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had personally ordered the killing. Trump has denied the intelligence, despite having been shown evidence. Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and senior adviser, "enjoys a close relationship" with the crown prince.

Texto completo: ATLANTA - A billionaire technology investor and philanthropist says he will provide grants to wipe out the student debt of the entire graduating class at Morehouse College - an estimated $40 million.
Robert F. Smith, this year's commencement speaker, made the announcement Sunday morning while addressing nearly 400 graduating seniors of the all-male historically black college in Atlanta. Smith is the Founder and CEO of Vista Equity Partners, a private equity firm that invests in software, data, and technology-driven companies.
"On behalf of the eight generations of my family that have been in this country, we're gonna put a little fuel in your bus," Smith told the graduates. "This is my class, 2019. And my family is making a grant to eliminate their student loans."
The announcement elicited stunned looks from faculty and students alike, before the graduates broke into the biggest cheers of the morning. Morehouse said it is the single largest gift to the college.
Smith, who received an honorary doctorate from Morehouse during the ceremony, had already announced a $1.5 million gift to the school.
The pledge to eliminate student debt for the class of 2019 is estimated to be $40 million.
In the weeks before graduating from Morehouse on Sunday, 22-year-old finance major Aaron Mitchom drew up a spreadsheet to calculate how long it would take him to pay back his $200,000 in student loans - 25 years at half his monthly salary, per his calculations.
In an instant, that number vanished. Mitchom, sitting in the crowd, wept.
Report: Trump, Kushner bank transactions raised red flag
NEW YORK - Multiple transactions involving legal entities controlled by President Donald Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner aroused the suspicion of anti-money laundering specialists at Deutsche Bank in 2016 and 2017, according to The New York Times.
The specialists recommended the matter be referred to a unit of the Treasury Department that polices financial crimes, but bank executives rejected their advice, the newspaper reported on Sunday.
As a result, the "suspicious activity reports" about the transactions were never filed with the government, the New York Times reported.
The report didn't give specifics about the nature of the transactions but said some of them involved money being transferred back and forth with foreign entities or individuals.
Report: Navy submariners kept list rating female crew, sex acts
Sailors aboard a U.S. Navy submarine circulated sexually explicit lists that ranked female crew members, an investigation found. The lists, first reported Friday by Military.com, were uncovered through a Freedom of Information Act request.
The 74-page investigative report reveals two lists - one with Yelp-like star ratings on the women and another containing "lewd and sexist comments" beside each woman's name, according to Military.com.
In February 2018, the USS Florida became the second to integrate female members. The misconduct came to light four months later, when two sailors aboard the Florida brought the lists to a superior officer, reporting that they were stored on an internal computer network and updated regularly, Military.com reported.
In oil-rich Venezuela, mile-long lines to buy gas in major city
MARACAIBO, Venezuela - U.S. sanctions on oil-rich Venezuela appear to be taking hold, resulting in mile-long lines for fuel in the South American nation's second-largest city, Maracaibo.
Some drivers said they'd had to wait almost 24 hours to fuel up, and people have been grabbing catnaps on the hoods of cars or in truck beds.
Nearing empty and stuck in line, infectious diseases doctor Yoli Urdaneta said she couldn't make her shift to treat patients.
"I've spent four days trying to get gasoline," Urdaneta said. "But I couldn't."
Russ Dallen, a Miami-based partner at the brokerage firm Caracas Capital Markets, said Sunday that stiff U.S. sanctions on top of Venezuela's decaying refineries has begun to hit home.
11 people reportedly killed in bar attack in Brazil
RIO DE JANEIRO - Gunmen roared up to a bar in Belem city in Brazil's northern Pará state and opened fire, killing six women and five men Sunday afternoon, media reports said.
A state spokeswoman would confirm only "a massacre" occurred but gave no details.
The G1 news website said police reported that seven gunmen were involved in the attack, which also wounded one person. The news outlet said the attackers arrived at the bar on a motorcycle and in three cars.
In late March, the federal government sent National Guard troops to Belém to reinforce security for 90 days.
State communications officials stopped answering phone calls. Military and civil police in Pará state also did not answer phone calls or respond to emails.
Plane crash in Honduras kills 4 Americans,
1 Canadian
TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras - Four Americans and a Canadian pilot were killed when a small plane went down off the coast of Roatan island in Honduras, officials said Sunday.
Armed Forces spokesman Jose Domingo Meza confirmed the nationalities of those who died in Saturday's crash.
The Piper Cherokee Six plummeted into the Atlantic shortly after takeoff from the popular tourist destination of Roatan en route to the port of Trujillo. The military said in a statement that rescue boats with police divers and firefighters recovered four bodies within minutes of the crash, and transported another to a hospital, where he later died.
The U.S. State Department also confirmed the deaths of four U.S. citizens. They did not release names.
In Indiana: An explosion leveled a home in southern Indiana early Sunday, killing one person, injuring two others and leaving several nearby homes uninhabitable, authorities said.
Hours after the explosion shattered windows across a Jeffersonville neighborhood and sent debris flying onto roofs, lawns and cars, officials had not said what they believe caused the explosion.
Indiana State Police, Jeffersonville police and firefighters were at the scene, along with crews from Vectren, a natural gas provider.
Jeffersonville police Lt. Isaac Parker told The Courier-Journal that the house exploded just before 5 a.m. Sunday in the Ohio River city.

Resumen: Disney unveiled Will Smith's very blue Genie from 'Aladdin' at the Grammy Awards. Now that the howling has subsided, how bad is the situation?

Texto completo: If Walt Disney Studios and director Guy Ritchie were granted three wishes, one of them would surely be that Will Smith's Genie in the live-action "Aladdin" would find a little love.
So far, there's been overwhelming vocal consternation over the pivotal character in the remake that flies into theaters May 24.
It was always going to be a bumpy ride for anyone stepping into the curled genie shoes after Robin Williams voiced his iconic, exhilarating role in 1992's animated "Aladdin. "
Fans rejoiced when the Genie-less first teaser arrived last October. "I fangirled so hard . . . It looks so good!" one tweeted. "I'm legit over here sobbing," another wrote. But the very blue unveiling of Smith's Genie in a Grammy Awards telecast "special look" was skewered on social media.
The New York Times' Kyle Buchanan feverishly led the tweeted criticism, including, "They premiered this image at night??? We are supposed to sleep after this???"
We could go on about the chorus of social media barbs, which became such a thing that John Oliver used the blue Genie image as a punchline on "Last Week Tonight," comparing it to the looming "disaster" when Britain leaves the European Union.
"You know how Twitter is. There’s a pitchfork army out there and they all join in. And right now, Will Smith’s blue Genie is out in front of this army, in a negative way," says Jeff Bock, senior box-office analyst for Exhibitor Relations. "The Genie just looked odd. And while it's called 'Aladdin,' all the attention since Robin Williams' role is focused on the Genie. "
First photo: The Internet is fixated on Will Smith's Genie, and not in a good way
The backlash: Twitter rips Will Smith's 'too blue' Genie after 'Aladdin' trailer airs
Disney wouldn't comment on the marketing aspects of the film, which has stoked excitement with fans who made 2016's live-action "The Jungle Book" a major hit. The studio stood behind its Genie in a statement to USA TODAY: “We have one of the most anticipated films of the year and are confident that audiences will fall in love with the Genie and all of the characters when it hits the big screen this May. ”
Bringing out the Will Smith Genie, and the blue, has been a slow, deliberate rollout for Disney after two teaser trailers – as if to ease fans into the full live-action blueness against the formidable history of Williams' cartoon creation.
In December, a smiling Smith was unveiled on the cover of Entertainment Weekly, minus his CGI blue coloring. After fans reacted badly, the star assured them on Instagram, "I’m gonna be BLUE! :-) This is how the Genie is in Human / Disguise Form. "
They didn't know how blue.
However awkward the first look, the negative reaction shouldn't be a surprise, according to director Raja Gosnell, who unveiled his own bright blue update of beloved animated characters in 2011's live-action "The Smurfs. "
"We didn’t have the Twitter world back then that we have now, thank God. But that unveiling was met with levels of horror and gnashing of teeth by the online community," says Gosnell. "There is always going to be some sort of outcry by the keyboard warriors. It was going to be the same thing with the blue Genie from 'Aladdin. ' "
"The Smurfs" went on to find its audience, make $563. 7 million in the worldwide box office, and Gosnell brought the live-action creations brought back for a 2013 sequel, "The Smurfs 2. "
But there are many voices who contend Disney missed the vital opportunity to make a strong first impression that Smith's Genie could hold his own against Williams' legacy.
Paul Michael Glaser conceptualized and directed 1996's "Kazaam" around 7-foot-1 superstar center Shaquille O'Neal. While the fantasy musical was disparaged by critics, visualizing Shaq as a genie was spot-on casting.
Glaser says the decision to depict Smith as blue and physically pumped up, like a live-action version of Williams' character, wasn't "a smart thing to do. "
"Making him blue was a bit of cop-out. But even more than that was the big, muscular look makes this Genie more comparable to the animated version. Why does a Genie have to be all of that?" says Glaser.
Listen to this week's episode of USA TODAY's podcast, The Mothership, to hear about upcoming Disney live-action remakes and whether they do more harm than good.
There's still time for the formidable Disney marketing machine, with the powers of charismatic PR power player Smith, to right the spilled bottle.
"Disney has its own magic lamps," says Bock. "And 'Aladdin' is fortunate to pretty much own Memorial Day weekend for family entertainment. So it's in good shape there. "
Part of the marketing blitz will include a full trailer, which still hasn't been released yet. Perri Nemiroff, senior producer of movie site Collider. com, suggests "scaling back on Genie in the marketing, that might be the smartest move after what we've seen. "
The emphasis could focus on other "Aladdin" aspects such as Mena Massoud as Aladdin, Naomi Scott as Jasmine and their adventure story.
Then Smith will have an entire movie to unfurl his full Genie.
"I just want to see Will Smith own that look and make that role his own," says Nemiroff. "I'm hoping my optimism will not be misplaced. "
Randall Jaynes, who has made a career as a deep-hued member of Blue Man Group and is now its artistic director, believes people will come to love this Genie and his vibrant coloring.
"You could already hear this Genie is Will Smith. It had his jingle and pizzazz, but the color is so evocative, it changed the look. Of course, people are going to get used to it," says Jaynes. "Welcome, Will Smith: Blue is a wonderful world to be in. "

What war with Iran would look like

Texto completo: If the long history of military conflict teaches us anything, it’s that wars, like marriages, are easier to get into than out. War with Iran would be no exception.
On paper, it would hardly be a contest. “It won't be a fair fight,” promised Gen. Frank McKenzie this month as tensions flared and the U.S. dispatched warships and bombers in response to unspecified threats from Iran to U.S. interests in the Persian Gulf region.
As the head of U.S. Central Command, McKenzie would be in charge of drawing up and executing the battle plan, assuming he’s not micromanaged by the White House.
Even while dismissing as “fake news” a New York Times report that contingency planning called for sending 120,000 U.S. troops to the Middle East, President Trump indicated that his inclination is to go big or go home.
“If we did that, we'd send a hell of a lot more troops than that,” he said.
[Related: White House rages at 'nonsense' WaPo, NYT reporting on Kushner, Iran]
The U.S. military is far superior to Iran’s in every significant way. Iran’s air force consists of about 330 combat aircraft, mostly aging or obsolete U.S., Chinese, and Soviet models, including American F-14s that predate the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Its navy has about 130 combatant surface ships, along with three diesel submarines, and its troops number a little over half a million, with roughly 350,000 soldiers in the army and another 150,000 in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which the Trump administration has just labeled a terrorist organization.
America's military enjoys state-of-the art weaponry and employs battlefield tactics honed by decades of real-world combat. Iran's ability to modernize its military has been crippled by four decades of sanctions, and it hasn’t fought a major war in 30 years.
In a conventional force-on-force war, like the 1991 Persian Gulf War, the U.S. would win in short order, at least on paper. But wars aren’t fought on paper, and the last notable tank-on-tank conventional land battle was the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.
“There are two ways to fight the United States military, asymmetrically and stupid, and you hope that your enemies pick stupid,” former national security adviser retired Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster said at a conference in Washington this month. In 2003, Saddam Hussein picked stupid. Iran would want to avoid that mistake.
[Also read: Pelosi: Trump not authorized to use military force in Iran]
Iran does have the ability to inflict considerable damage with its arsenal of precision strike ballistic and cruise missiles and armed drones, which it could employ in asymmetric warfare. Both military and commercial targets would be at risk, shutting down the vital Strait of Hormuz, through which one-fifth of the world’s oil flows.
Both the U.S. and Iran say they don’t want war, but with both sides trading threats, all it would take is one incident based on a miscalculation or misunderstanding to light the fuse.
“I think there's that risk, absolutely,” said former Defense Secretary Robert Gates on CBS this month. “If the Iranians make the mistake of launching an attack in the Persian Gulf on an American warship, or if they carry out an operation against American troops in Iraq or something like that, the administration probably won't have any alternative but to retaliate.”
So what would that sort of accidental war look like?
It could start slow: an attack by a rogue Iranian patrol boat on a U.S. ship, prompting an airstrike in response from the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln in the Persian Gulf. An Iranian cruise or ballistic missile attack could target the carrier, followed by more U.S. airstrikes against Iranian targets, including advanced S-300 air defenses Iran has from Russia. Then shipping shuts down, not because Iran has closed the strait but because the Persian Gulf is an active war zone.
[Opinion: How Trump must bring clarity to his Iran policy]
The U.S. can punish Iran. It can wipe out its air force and sink its ships, but unless it wants to invade and occupy a country that is four times the size of Iraq, it can’t force Iran to surrender.
The U.S. goal in squeezing Iran economically is to make the country’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and the rest of the regime so unpopular that the people will rise up and replace him.
Former Secretary of State and Joint Chiefs Chairman Colin Powell invoked Pottery Barn’s (apocryphal) “you break it, you buy it” policy to argue that when you invade a country, you own it. Defeating Iran militarily would be a pyrrhic victory, especially without that pesky detail known as an exit strategy.
While the generals and admirals at the Pentagon are often accused of fighting the last war, the hard lessons that have come from the U.S. experience in Iraq and Afghanistan are that winning the war is the easy part, while winning the peace can be impossible unless you have the support of the people you have conquered.
Unleashing the dogs of war is risky business, fraught with unpredictable circumstances and unintended consequences. No war goes as planned. Even the 1991 Iraq war, in which a coalition led by the U.S. liberated Kuwait after just six weeks of bombing and a four-day ground invasion, which was hailed as a textbook application of decisive force, saddled the U.S. with years of patrolling no-fly zones in the north and south. What seemed like a quick and easy victory at first blush kept 20,000 U.S. troops tied down in Saudi Arabia and Turkey playing cat and mouse with Saddam Hussein’s anti-aircraft missiles for more than a decade and became part of the impetus for the 2003 invasion to finish the job.
War with Iran would be messy. Without a clear achievable objective and a realistic exit strategy, it could easily turn into another war without any satisfying conclusion.
Or as Trump put it in his State of the Union address in February, “Great nations do not fight endless wars.”

Texto completo: The UCLA Anderson School of Management has named five ProPublica projects as finalists for this year’s Gerald Loeb Awards, one of the most prestigious prizes in business and financial journalism.
The finalists include Trump, Inc., ProPublica and WNYC’s joint podcast exploring the mysteries of the president’s businesses — what deals are happening and who might be profiting from his administration — in the audio category.
An investigation into age discrimination, by Peter Gosselin, Ariana Tobin and Ranjani Chakraborty, of Vox, is a finalist in beat reporting. The series showed how IBM, in its scramble to compete with new rivals, has cut swaths of its most senior employees — flouting rules against age bias.
Marshall Allen’s ongoing series, Health Insurance Hustle, is a finalist in the explanatory category. Co-published with NPR Shots, Allen’s reporting exposed the confounding ways insurers game their profits: using hidden schemes, side deals and fees that drive up costs.
Sloan Kettering Cancer Center’s Crisis, a collaboration between ProPublica’s Charles Ornstein and The New York Times’ Katie Thomas, is a finalist in local reporting. Their investigation uncovered multiple conflicts of interest between the renowned New York hospital’s staff and health care companies, ultimately leading to the resignation of the hospital’s chief medical officer.
ProPublica’s first full-length feature film, Unprotected, is a finalist in the video category. The documentary, in partnership with Time, examined how the acclaimed American charity More Than Me rose to fame for saving vulnerable girls in Liberia from sexual exploitation. But from the beginning, girls were being raped by one of the nonprofit’s key leaders, provoking international discussion about the lack of accountability for charities working abroad.
Winners will be announced at a ceremony in June. See the full list of finalists here.

Arrestan a cuatro activistas pro Maduro que ocupaban embajada venezolana en Washington

Texto completo: Cuatro activistas que han protagonizado protestas dentro de la embajada venezolana en Washington durante semanas han sido arrestados por la policía , según dijo una activista el jueves.
El lunes por la noche, las autoridades notificaron a los actividades que debían salir de la embajada por allanamiento de propiedad privada. Durante más de un mes la embajada fue el escenario de una disputa entre los activistas a favor del chavismo, dentro de la embajada, y un grupo de expatriados venezolanos fuera de las instalaciones. Cuando se dio la orden de evacuación, se reportó que tres activistas habían desalojado, pero otros cuatro permanecían ocupándola.
Medea Benjamín, cofundadora de la organización Code Pink , dijo a la agencia de noticias The Associated Press que la policía entró a la sede diplomática por la mañana para arrestar a los activistas que permanecían en ella.
Un portavoz del Departamento de Estado, que pidió no ser identificado, dijo que agentes de seguridad “arrestaron y desalojaron a personas que habían ingresado ilegalmente”.
A eso del mediodía, varias patrullas policiales abandonaban la zona. En un video colocado en redes sociales por Code Pink se ve a una de las activistas, Adrienne Pine, en el asiento trasero de una de las patrullas, afirmando que “esta es una orden ilegal”. Mara Verheyden-Hilliard, abogada de los activistas, dijo que trataba de averiguar dónde se encontraban y cuáles serían los cargos penales en su contra.
Los activistas consideran que Nicolás Maduro es el presidente legítimo de Venezuela. Pero Estados Unidos y medio centenar de países sostienen que la reelección reciente de Maduro fue fraudulenta y respaldan al presidente interino, Juan Guaidó. Code Pink se identifica como un gripo liderado por mujeres que apoya iniciativas por los derechos humanos y la paz. La ONU ha documentado graves violaciones de los derechos humanos bajo el régimen de Maduro, incluyendo “homicidios, el uso excesivo de la fuerza en contra de manifestantes, detenciones arbitrarias, malos tratos y tortura”.
El embajador designado por Guaidó, Carlos Vecchio, habia pedido ayuda a las autoridades estadounidenses para liberar la sede, que había estado vacía desde que al personal diplomático de Maaduro se le venciera la visa en abril, según reportes. El gobierno interino de Guaidó ya había tomado el control de dos sedes militares en Washington D.C. y el consulado venezolano en Nueva York.
Vecchio anunció que el jueves en la noche irá a la embajada y se dirigirá a los venezolanos que se han aglomerado en las cercanías.
Guaidó agradeció el jueves a la diáspora venezolana por “ejercer soberanía” y “recuperar nuestra embajada en Washington”, y dijo, en un breve mensaje de su cuenta de Twitter, que se inicia el “proceso de recuperación” de las sedes diplomáticas venezolanas en el mundo. “Estaremos en todos los planos de lucha por la democracia”, agregó.
Inicialmente, al menos 30 activistas entraron a la embajada, pero la cifra se redujo gradualmente. Los activistas dormían dentro de la embajada y decían que eran invitados del régimen de Nicolás Maduro y su misión era oponerse a una “intervención militar estadounidense” en Venezuela , reportó el New York Times.
La sede diplomática está sin electricidad desde la semana pasada.
El senador republicano por la Florida Marco Rubio comparó la falta de electricidad con los constantes recortes de luz que sufren los venezolanos en su día a día.
“Ahora saben lo que es la vida de las personas en Venezyela bajo Maduro”, tuiteó Rubio.

Texto completo: After nearly 300 episodes, "The Big Bang Theory" wraps up on CBS. And "Skyfall" is on Syfy.
What's on TV
THE BIG BANG THEORY 8 p.m. on CBS. When this nerd-chic sitcom began in September 2007, Alessandra Stanley wrote in a review in The New York Times that 2007 was "the year of breakthroughs: First the iPhone, now the tall, dark and handsome nerd." You could argue that "The Big Bang Theory" turned into something like the iPhone of sitcoms: wildly popular and filled with tech. When it ends its run on Thursday with a finale double-feature of two episodes, "The Big Bang Theory" will have been the longest-running multicamera comedy series ever. Created by Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady, the show made a star out of Jim Parsons, whose Sheldon Cooper character (one of the show's awkward scientists) has earned Parsons four Emmy Awards and is the focus of a spinoff, "Young Sheldon," which will be left to carry the torch -- or light saber.
SKYFALL (2012) 5:30 p.m. on Syfy. The chief theater critics for The New York Times both think that Sam Mendes should and will win a Tony Award next month for directing "The Ferryman" on Broadway. Mendes reached new levels of fame earlier in the decade by directing this third outing of Daniel Craig's James Bond, which won critical praise and resuscitated Craig's dour Bond after the shakily received "Quantum of Solace." Javier Bardem takes on villain duties. In her review for The Times, Manohla Dargis praised Mendes's directing. "There's brutal death here," she wrote. "But there's also a pervading sense of mortality that makes the falling bodies register a little longer than they sometimes do in a Bond movie."
What's Streaming
GOOD SAM (2019) Stream on Netflix. In real life, when a reporter has a subject that involves an unknown person capturing the attention of a big city by periodically performing the same act in different locations around the city, it is seldom under happy circumstances -- particularly if that mystery figure is given a nickname for those deeds. But this feel-good Netflix movie focuses on positive news: In its fictional New York, an unknown person nicknamed Good Sam has been leaving bags filled with $ 100,000 on random doorsteps, and a young TV reporter (Tiya Sircar) tries to discover the individual's identity.
UNDER THE SILVER LAKE (2019) Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. The director David Robert Mitchell's follow-up to "It Follows," his 2015 horror breakout, centers on a young Los Angeles man played by Andrew Garfield. The proceedings involve dog murders, a missing woman and references to Alfred Hitchcock, David Lynch and Raymond Chandler. It is a "shaggy-dog tale of wild conspiracism and male petulance," A. O. Scott wrote in his review for The Times. "There are some moments of humor and surprise embedded in the overwrought intricacies and long slack stretches of the plot," Scott noted. "But beyond the coy nostalgia and the timid satire is a feeling of bottomless exhaustion."

Texto completo: Mothers' Day can be bittersweet. ∙ For those who have lost their mothers, this day can be weighted with emotional memories, both good and bad. ∙ Those who still have their moms and who are blessed with being a mom, know there's nothing like a mother's love. ∙ As we celebrate this upcoming Mother's Day, I want to discuss the positive impact a mother's nurturing has on the outcome of a child. ∙ It's a given, mothers want what's best for their children; though occasionally, what is perceived as "best" in the mother's eyes can also have a reverse impact on the child's emotional and behavioral disposition.
As an example, mothers (and parents in general) focus on the importance of their child's academic performance; though education is important and does set the stage for future opportunities, there are other attributes to consider.
A child who is taught to manage their emotions is two times more likely to become successful in life.
In addition, children with good self-control and reduced compulsivity are less likely to have behavioral problems, drink, take drugs or end up in jail.
Furthermore, a mother's tone while speaking to her child also affects the brain's structural development.
A recent study conducted by Dr. Joan Luby from the Washington School of Medicine in St. Louis, Missouri, compared the interaction and development of two separate groups of 3- and 4-year-old children.
The first group hosted extremely nurturing and interactive mothers, while the second group had mothers with less or non-nurturing attributes.
After four years of research, the children who had considerable amounts of nurturing and guidance developed a 10 percent larger hippocampus on MRI brain scan studies.
The hippocampus, located in the center of the brain, directs bodily functions, controls learning and memory, while also supporting the body's response to emotional stress.
A subsequent study conducted by Dr. Akemi Tomado, a child mental health researcher in Japan, found less developed gray matter in the brains of children who had been verbally abused.
Gray matter, a major component in the brain, controls emotions, attention span and decision-making.
Children whose parents frequently yell and repeatedly state the children were "bad" exhibited lower self-esteem.
Typically, parents who use strong but directly negative language toward children believe they are making their child more responsible and compliant; research shows that parental sarcasm and threats inadvertently make children feel guilty, unloved and inferior.
This poor self-perception can lead to depression and/or anxiety in children.
So, what's the best approach in nurturing your child? Disciplining your child, teaching your child? What's the best way to communicate while trying to teach them right from wrong?
Stay calm, model good behavior. Recognize your emotions. Never try to discipline a child when you are angry.
Seek professional help when needed to better handle parent/child issues.
Don't suppress child's feelings. Allow the child to express his or her emotions such as crying, but teach the child to define behavior with a word.
For example, you state: "You are frustrated your brother took your toy but hitting your brother is never OK."
Feelings are what they are. Children should own their feelings, but outbursts caused by feelings are not good and will get them into trouble.
Have empathy for your child. Let your child know you are listening. As an example, say, "I understand you are angry, you want to yell and scream, please know I'm here if you need me."
You are not agreeing with the behavior but stating you do understand it.
It's important to note, screaming at a yelling child only makes the yelling louder as he or she wants to be heard.
Remember, if you both are yelling, no one is listening.
Problem solve. Once their anger dissipates, children need guidance to help problem solve.
A mother could say, "Next time, when you become angry, how could you behave differently?"
When the child responds with a different solution, answer: "If you do that instead, what do you think would happen next time?"
This will build the child's self-esteem and improve inappropriate responses over time. Always watch for good behavior and praise that behavior.
Listen. Make sure when communicating with children they have your undivided attention. No phones allowed
If you don't give them undivided attention, your child will seek help elsewhere or worse, stop talking to you altogether, while internalizing stress.
Avoid pacifying bad behavior. The American Academy of Pediatrics advises parents against using technology to pacify an unruly child as this method does not allow the child to learn to regulate his or her emotions.
Seek help from a pediatric healthcare professional when needed.
Some children need an evaluation to rule out autism, developmental delay, anxiety, ADD or ADHD. Sometimes a formal behavior modification program can be instituted to encourage good behavior and build self-esteem.
Our job as mothers is to nurture our children to help them find their unique gifts, as they all possess them.
As New York Times best-selling author, Dr. Wendy Mogel, states, "Try to see your child as a seed that came in a packet without a label. Your job is to provide the right environment and nutrients, while also pulling out the weeds. You can't decide what kind of flower you'll get, or in which season it will bloom."

PREZ: NO PLANS TO SEND TROOPS TO MIDDLE EAST

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump on Tuesday dismissed reports that his administration has been weighing a plan to deploy 120,000 troops to the Middle East, but he did not rule out sending "a hell of a lot more troops than that" amid escalating tensions with Iran.
Trump, speaking to reporters at the White House, said he would "absolutely" consider sending an influx of troops to the region, but said no plans were in the works, when asked about a New York Times report, published Monday, that indicated his top national security aides discussed a military plan last week to deploy about 120,000 U.S. troops to the Middle East if Iran strikes against American forces.
"Would I do that? Absolutely. But we have not planned for that. Hopefully we don't have to plan for that," Trump said. "Hopefully we're not going to have to plan for that. And if we did that, we'd send a hell of a lot more troops than that."
Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan presented the updated military plan on Thursday, according to The Times, which cited more than a half-dozen national security officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The plan also calls for an uptick in troops if Iran intensifies its efforts to rebuild its nuclear weapons program. It's unclear  whether Trump has been briefed on the plan, according to the Times report.
The proposed new military strategy comes amid increased tensions between Tehran and Washington that have accelerated in the past year after Trump delivered on his campaign pledge to withdraw from the Obama-era Iran nuclear deal. 
On Tuesday morning, Hesameddin Ashena, an adviser to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, in a tweet directed at Trump, said Trump risked entering "a war" for accepting the guidance of White House National Security Adviser John Bolton, who has long called for regime change in Iran.
"You wanted a better deal with Iran. Looks like you are going to get a war instead," Ashena tweeted. "That's what happens when you listen to the mustache. Good luck in 2020!"
In the past year, the Trump administration has pushed a "maximum pressure" campaign of economic sanctions against Iran, designed in large part by Bolton.
Last week, Bolton announced the United States was deploying an aircraft carrier to the Middle East, citing intelligence that indicated Iran was planning an attack on U.S. troops in the region. On Monday, after a pair of Saudi oil tankers and a Norwegian ship were struck with explosives in the Persian Gulf during the weekend, U.S. intelligence officials said Iran was behind the incident.
Rouhani threatened last week to stop complying with parts of the nuclear deal if the remaining countries belonging to the pact - including France and Germany - do not deliver a plan within 60 days to provide Iran with relief from Trump's economic sanctions.
Trump withdrew from the multinational accord last May despite the protestations of other allied nations who argued the accord is central to keeping Iran from developing a nuclear weapons arsenal.
Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), in a Senate floor speech on Tuesday, questioned the Trump administration's strategy in Iran.
"What is the strategy here?" said the Senate minority leader. "The administration just began a maximum pressure campaign of sanctions against Iran to squeeze its economy. Doesn't it make sense to see if your policy is working before preparing for potential troop deployments - particularly in such large numb

Rutgers' Daily Targum denied funds

Texto completo: For the first time in its history, not enough Rutgers University students voted to fund The Daily Targum, its 150-year-old New Brunswick campus newspaper.
For the vote to pass, at least 25 percent of eligible voters — undergraduate students with 104 or fewer credits — from each of the eight schools at Rutgers-New Brunswick must approve the fee on their bills. The failure to pass the referendum was due to the low turnout.
"There's been a decline in readership of print newspapers across the country, more and more local papers rely heavily on digital subscriptions to keep their papers afloat – and I think that the referendum failure is kind of a culmination of that," said Sandy Giacobbe, the paper's business manager.
Since 1980, when the paper first became independent, the main revenue source for The Daily Targum's daily operation, delivery and print production has come from students through a fee they pay on their semester term bills. Every three years, a referendum vote takes place throughout 10 days in April, when eligible student voters can submit a ballot in favor or against keeping the fee on their bills for the next six semesters.
While the vote has previously failed to pass in some schools, this was the first time the vote failed to pass for at all eight schools: School of Arts and Sciences, Rutgers Business School, School of Pharmacy, School of Engineering, Mason Gross School of Arts, School of Management and Labor Relations, and Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy.
Of the 23,996 eligible voters, only 6,578 participated. There were 4,461 votes for the referendum and 2,117 against it.
Students have the option during the semester to request a refund of the $11.25 fee.
At each school, there were more votes in favor of the funding the paper than against it, but not enough students voted to reach the minimum requirement of 25 percent.
Less than 30 percent of eligible voters turned out to the polls, Giacobbe said. Moving forward, the staff hopes to engage more with students and increase involvement prior to future referendums, he said.
"The majority of our funding comes through the line item on our term bill and it will definitely be affecting our budget going forward," said Giacobbe, a junior at the school studying political science. "We're going to be looking into new ways to obtain funding."
The paper's board of trustees, made up of four alumni members and four active students, planned to meet with staff to explore the possibility of donations, Giacobbe said.
"We do not know what the future holds, but the Targum Publishing Company's Board of Trustees and staff will be working to address this funding crisis," the paper posted on its website.
Supporters and alumni of the college newspaper spoke out on Twitter after the announcement on their willingness to donate to keep the paper operating.
"Not only is the Targum a necessary check on authority at Rutgers, but it's the way young journalists there learn the ropes," said Tom Wright-Piersanti, an editor on the New York Times politics desk.
Asking the university for funding, however, won't likely be the paper's first avenue to obtain the money it needs, Giacobbe said.
"We're a student-run paper at heart and remaining independent is really important to us," he said. "We're really in an uncharted territory now, but the Targum has been around since 1869 – we have 150 years of history – and I don't see that stopping any time soon."

What's next for 76ers? Is coach Brett Brown out? Will Jimmy Butler, Tobias Harris stay?

Texto completo: TORONTO — The Process is dead. Long live the process.
Asked where The Process is at this stage of his career, Philadelphia 76ers All-Star center Joel Embiid — dejected from losing to Toronto, 92-90 in Game 7 on Sunday — said, “I don’t give a damn about The Process. ”
Quite the admission from Embiid, who came to embody the Sixers’ divisive rebuild set forth by former general manager Sam Hinkie.
Regardless whether Embiid uttered his comment in the disappointment of defeat or if that’s how he really feels, the Sixers have reached a critical moment in this era.
Where do they go from here? Who is the coach and who is on the team at the start of the 2019-20 season?
Kawhi's historic buzzer-beater: Inside shot that lifted Raptors into East finals
General manager Elton Brand has proven himself in his first season in the job following the Bryan Colangelo Twitter disgrace that resulted in Colangelo losing his job.
Brand acquired Jimmy Butler and Tobias Harris in trades during the season, but the work gets more difficult, starting with what happens to Coach Brett Brown.
The New York Times reported that it will be difficult for Brown to save his job if the Sixers didn’t advance to the conference finals. Ownership is on record saying the Sixers have the talent to beat anyone in the East, and Brand told reporters in April the goal was to get deeper in the playoffs than last season, which was a second-round exit, the same as this season.
Turning pro: Michigan's John Beilein leaving to coach Cavaliers
Porzingis incident: Mavericks star involved in altercation at club in Latvia
Does Brown take the fall for that? Basing his future on an incredible buzzer-beater by Kawhi Leonard in a Game 7 seems short-sighted.
Brown had his playoff starting five — Embiid, Ben Simmons, Jimmy Butler, Tobias Harris and J. J. Redick — for 10 regular-season games. He had to coach three iterations of 2018-19 Sixers: the team he had at a training camp, the team he had after the Sixers traded for Butler in November and the team he had when the Sixers acquired Harris from the Los Angeles Clippers in February.
A case can be made for bringing Brown back. But if the Sixers don’t think he is the coach to get them to the next level, that’s their prerogative. But it shouldn’t be based on the outcome of a single Game 7 result on the road.
If Philadelphia makes a coaching change, Brand better have his replacement ready to go — like Toronto president Masai Ujiri replaced Dwane Casey with Nick Nurse following last season’s playoff exit. If not, this has the potential to backfire.
The Sixers need to resolve that then focus on their roster. Jimmy Butler likely will become a free agent and Tobias Harris will be a free agent. Do those two want to come back, and at what price and length of contract? Giving up what they did in trades to get those two indicates they are willing spend to keep both.
A third starter, J. J. Redick, is also a free agent along with Mike Scott, Amir Johnson, Greg Monroe and Boban Marjanovic.
Because Philadelphia has several young players on team friendly contracts, the Sixers have money to spend in free agency.
In the draft, the Sixers have one first-round pick and three second-round picks. While the draft is important, it’s far less so compared to the coaching situation and free agency.
It's one of the more intriguing offseason story lines: how do the Sixers take the next step of their development? How do they become a championship contender?
It's a process, that's for sure, and it's in Elton Brand's hands.

Texto completo: Christopher Ashley, a Tony Award-winning director, has two musicals coming to St. Louis -- and to the same theater.
The first, set to begin performances at the Fox Theater on Tuesday, is "Come From Away." Based on a true story, the show takes place in a Canadian town that hosted more than 6,000 diverted airline passengers in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The second, "Escape to Margaritaville," features Jimmy Buffett songs and takes the stage in October as part of the 2019-20 Fox season.
The shows appear to be quite different from each other. But Ashley says they have at least one quality in common.
"Both share a real affection for their characters and a real sense that there is goodness in the world," he says.
With book, music and lyrics by Irene Sankoff and David Hein, "Come From Away" explores what happened after about 40 planes were diverted to Gander, a small town on the island of Newfoundland. The show is largely based on interviews that Sankoff and Hein conducted with participants of the event 10 years later.
The New York Times praised the show for covering "a vast expanse of sensitive material with a respect for its complexity."
Ashley says he signed onto "Come From Away" not only because of its artistic merits but also its distinctive approach to the tragedy.
"I was in New York during 9/11 and had all kinds of very conflicted and unresolved feelings about that attack," he says. "It was such a relief to read something that took place during that week but 1,500 miles away from New York City -- and to tell a story about people behaving beautifully at the worst possible moment of their lives."
Ashley's work on "Come From Away" earned him the 2017 Tony Award for best direction of a musical.
With only 12 actors playing multiple roles, "Come From Away" posed intriguing challenges, he says.
"That cast has to turn on a dime and find ways to convince you -- by changing just a costume piece, or how they move their bodies, or their dialect -- that they're different characters," Ashley says. "It's been an extraordinary journey."
Ashley is artistic director of the La Jolla Playhouse at the University of California, San Diego. He has a notable record as a director of straight plays, including the one-person show "Blown Sideways Through Life," written and performed by Claudia Shear, and the comedy "Jeffrey" by Paul Rudnick.
But arguably, Ashley is best known for directing musicals, including the Broadway productions of "Memphis" and "Xanadu."
"I really try to surprise myself with the shows that I pick," he says. "But I've probably gotten the most notice for the musicals that I've done.
"New musicals are fiendishly difficult to get right," Ashley says. "So many different collaborators and creative team members all have to be working beautifully and to the same ends to make them work. But when they work, nothing is more satisfying than a musical. I love musicals -- I think I was in four productions of 'Oliver' before I was 10 years old."
"Come From Away" was first produced in Canada in 2013. Two years later, La Jolla Playhouse collaborated with Seattle Repertory Theatre for its first professional U.S. production. The show opened on Broadway in 2017.
In the prevailing political climate, Ashley says, "Come From Away" resonates as strongly as ever.
"It's really a story about generosity and kindness," he says. "And the world keeps providing new news that keeps that story really current. So it feels great to send a cast onstage every night to talk about people taking care of strangers."

Texto completo: When it comes to the Kentucky Derby, field size has always mattered.
The first Kentucky Derby in 1875 featured 15 horses, and in 1974, a record 23 competed in the 100th edition of the Run for the Roses at Churchill Downs.
After that 1974 Derby won by Cannonade, Jim Murray of the Los Angeles Times wrote, "It was a race only if you consider the Battle of Jutland a race. The last time anything this wild took place on horseback the riders all had fur hats on them and went around riding down peasants."
Earlie Fires, whose Sharp Gary finished 13th in that 1974 Derby, sounded like a jockey straight out of the 21st century.
"There were too many horses out there," Fires told the New York Times. "Every time I tried to make a move, my horse was knocked back."
A year later, Churchill Downs decided to cap the Kentucky Derby at 20 horses, and the debate has raged ever since: "Is the Derby too crowded?"
The debate has kindled once again after Saturday's controversial finish in the 145th Kentucky Derby. Maximum Security was disqualified from first place to 17th place after race stewards ruled he interfered other horses on the second turn, the first time a Derby winner had been taken down for interference.
Traffic issues are a given in a 20-horse field and have become as much a part of the Derby experience as mint juleps and jacked-up hotel rates. But with his first-ever Derby victory taken away, Maximum Security owner Gary West placed the blame on Churchill Downs.
"The reason that they have 20 horses instead of 14, like they do in every other major race in America, including the Kentucky Oaks and all the Breeders' Cup races, which are kind of the gold standard races in America, is because ... Churchill Downs makes more money on the races by having 20 horses in the race than by having 14 horses in the race," West said.
"And, what I think they are doing and what they have done is, they are putting profits ahead of the lives of both horses and people, and I don't think that's right."
Kevin Flanery, president of Churchill Downs Racetrack, immediately responded.
"The infraction committed by Maximum Security has nothing to do with the number of horses in the race, which has been a consistent number for many years, and there is no evidence to the contrary," Flanery said.
Why Churchill sticks to a 20-horse field But why does Churchill Downs subject itself to such criticism when the standard limit for every other major race in the United States — including the Preakness and Belmont — is 14 horses?
Darren Rogers, Churchill Downs' senior director of communications and media services, said the Derby may be the only race in North America that can annually attract more than 14 horses.
Rogers also noted the Derby's 11/4-mile distance allows a quarter of a mile to maneuver before entering the first turn. Conversely, the Kentucky Oaks is capped at 14 horses because of its 11/8-mile distance, which allows one less furlong going into the first turn.
"Every element of a race — from the start to the finish — is a safety concern, but we just don't believe reducing the size of the Derby field to any specific number will eliminate the inherent risk that comes with competition," Rogers said.
How the 14-horse field came to be There's no clear answer for why 14 became the standard limit for a horse race, but it could be traced to Clay Puett. He built the first electric starting gate in 1939, and it has become the standard design for the majority of gates around the world, including the ones used at Churchill Downs.
Puett's first gate was made for 12 horses, and tracks began asking for 14-horse gates as the sport's popularity grew.
Mike Costello, president of United Puett Electrical Starting Gate Corp., said the majority of tracks use 12-horse gates now because of diminishing field sizes.
For the Derby, Churchill uses its 14-horse gate and attaches an auxiliary six-horse gate to accommodate the 20-horse field. One criticism of the process is that the gap between the No. 14 and No. 15 spots creates a safety issue as horses vie for space entering the first turn.
Costello said his company could make a 20-horse gate for the Derby — "I can't tell you the cost because I've never made a 20," he said — and Rogers said it's a purchase Churchill Downs could consider in the future.
"As with everything, we're open to discussing anything that could have a meaningful impact as it relates to safety," Rogers said.
Longshots fuel drive for bigger field But is a bigger field a better field?
Since 2013, the Derby field has been determined by a points system that awards horses for top-four finishes in predetermined prep races. The top 20 horses in the standings qualify for the Derby.
Of the horses ranked Nos. 15-20 in the points standings since 2013, six have finished among the top four in the Derby — Country House (first in 2019), Instilled Regard (fourth in 2018), Lookin At Lee (second in 2017), Battle of Midway (third in 2017), Commanding Curve (second in 2014) and Golden Soul (second in 2013).
Battle of Midway, one of the 23 horses who died during a recent rash of deaths at Santa Anita Park, is the only one of the six to win a graded-stakes race since his Kentucky Derby run.
On average, horses ranked Nos. 15-20 in the points standings have finished in 11th place in the Derby.
The statistics seem to indicate the extra six horses don't necessarily make the Derby field stronger, but trainers are mixed on what — if anything — to do about it.
Bob Baffert, who has won the Kentucky Derby five times, is in favor of cutting the field.
"The top 14 horses," Baffert said. "After that, it's like a free-for-all."
Kenny McPeek noted several races overseas have more than 20 horses and said he doesn't see the need for change in the Kentucky Derby.
"I don't think a big field is a big deal," McPeek said. "It makes it harder to win, but it doesn't make it any more unsafe — 20 horses as opposed to six. I've seen (interferences) happen in a six-horse field."
No changes expected anytime soon Asked about the process it would take to reduce the size of the Derby field, Rogers wouldn't consider the topic — making it clear the 20-horse limit is here to stay for the foreseeable future.
Owners and trainers — both big and small — love the opportunity to race in the Kentucky Derby. Gamblers enjoy the chance to make a big score.
And if there's a little extra traffic on the track, so be it.
"The Derby is a race unlike any other," Rogers said. "It's a special event that many owners and trainers and jockeys want to be a part of."

BLUE WHAT? MUSK'S COLORFUL WAY OF TWEAKING BEZOS

Texto completo: If there are two things that Elon Musk loves, they must be tweeting and using his tweets to tweak Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos especially when it comes to the two billionaires' private space programs.
So it should probably have come as no surprise that Musk, who in addition to running Tesla is also CEO of space-exploration company SpaceX, went on Twitter late Thursday to poke at Bezos and his Blue Origin space company. The impetus for Musk's cheeky tweet was Blue Origin unveiling the Blue Moon, its first planned lunar lander.
Bezos showed off the Blue Moon at a presentation Thursday. The New York Times wrote a story about the lunar lander, which included an image from Bezos' presentation that showed the Blue Moon on the moon and the words "Blue Moon" across the lander.
That's where Musk came in.
Musk started his tweet saying, "Oh stop teasing, Jeff," next to an image of a winking face emoji. But there was more. The rest of the tweet included an altered image from the Times' story that showed the Blue Moon upon the moon's surface. Only under a different name.
In the image tweeted by Musk, the word "Moon" had been marked out and replaced by  "Balls."
So, yeah: Elon Musk, a billionaire CEO of one of the most famous companies in the world, sent out a tweet using a colorful bit of juvenile humor.
This wasn't the first time Musk has used Twitter to make fun of Bezos' space-exploration efforts. In April, Musk called Bezos a "copycat" for his plans to launch 3,000 satellites into orbit to provide wireless internet access to remote areas around the world. That tweet included the word "copy" next to a cat emoji.
So much for space being the final frontier when you have Twitter as your battlefield.

Texto completo: The first season of "Pose" begins streaming on Netflix. And the first episode of the four-part Wu-Tang Clan docuseries hits Showtime.
What's Streaming
POSE Stream on Netflix. If you were dazzled by Billy Porter's elaborate entrance at the Met Gala on Monday night, you may also enjoy his performance as Pray Tell, the M.C. of extravagant balls, on "Pose." The show, which includes Ryan Murphy as co-creator, transports audiences back to 1987 New York, where gay, transgender and minority youth started walking in the city's vogueing competitions. Set around the same time as "Paris Is Burning," the series feels like "an attempt to better understand the present by re-examining the 1980s as an origin story," James Poniewozik wrote in his New York Times review. "It's a story of struggle -- the AIDS crisis is a constant shadow -- but it spotlights its characters' aspirations," he added. "It's sincere, buoyant and fun, stunningly designed, mindful that a show about balls should be capable of having one."
SHÉHÉRAZADE Stream on Netflix. This French love story centers on two teenagers and unfolds in Marseille's gritty underbelly. It follows Zachary, played by Dylan Robert, who is released from juvenile detention. He meets Shéhérazade (Kenza Fortas), a former classmate who is a prostitute. Zachary, in need of cash, begins to work as her pimp, and their working relationship bleeds into a complicated romance.
WINE COUNTRY Stream on Netflix. Pour yourself a glass of wine and join Amy Poehler, Maya Rudolph, Rachel Dratch, Tina Fey and Jason Schwartzman on a debaucherous birthday trip to Napa Valley, Calif. Poehler directs this romp, in which a group of middle-age friends reunite for the occasion, only to unravel as the wine flows and the big personalities clash. There's Abby (Poehler), who, as the trip's planner, is worried about every detail; Rebecca (Dratch), who doesn't seem thrilled about turning 50; and Naomi (Rudolph), who at one point rolls off a piano midserenade. "You wouldn't want to be in that bar or, really, anywhere these women assemble," Manohla Dargis wrote in her Times review, "but Rudolph is a treat."
What's on TV
WU-TANG CLAN: OF MICS AND MEN 9 p.m. on Showtime. When the Wu-Tang Clan emerged onto the New York City hip-hop scene in the early '90s, the group seemed almost like a team of rap superheroes. Now that many of its members, like RZA, GZA, Method Man and Ghostface Killah, are household names, the filmmaker Sacha Jenkins decided to tell the group's origin story. In this four-part docuseries, he sits down with each of the nine living members -- many of whom where childhood friends in Brooklyn and Staten Island -- to talk about how they became one of the most influential rap groups of all time. Weaving together interviews with archival footage and performances, the show reflects on the members' lyrical genius, entrepreneurship and sociopolitical consciousness, which still resonates with audiences.

Texto completo: Political cartoons have served as a vital source of social commentary for nearly three centuries. Unfortunately, this species of political expression is facing extinction.
We should not be sanguine about it. Political cartoons have long been a language all their own, a unique and irreplaceable vehicle to make a point. In an increasingly visual culture, they should be thriving. But the opposite is true.
The history of political cartooning goes back to early forms of English caricature and satire. The painter William Hogarth used engravings to poke the wealthy and to articulate other flights of fancy. The eight paintings that compose "A Rake’s Progress" explored the fictitious downfall of a wealthy merchant’s son, Tom Rakewell. He abused his privilege, blew his sizable fortune on gambling and prostitutes, married an “old maid” and lost more money, was sent to debtors' prison, went insane, and died penniless. In Hogarth’s view, wealth and power didn’t make one perfect or invincible in the eyes of the law.
James Gillray, another English illustrator, has been called the father of the political cartoon. A tour de force in sociopolitical commentary, he challenged the boundaries of satire and good taste. His most famous cartoon, “The Plumb-Pudding in Danger, or, State Epicures Taking un Petit Souper,” published about 1818, witnessed the ravenous British Prime Minister William Pitt and French Emperor Napoléon Bonaparte carving up the world at the dinner table. The cartoon attacked their ambitions for conquest and domination, and Gillray lampooned Pitt’s skinny frame and Napoléon’s beakish nose to make them look weak and foolish.

Benjamin Franklin’s woodcarving “Join or Die” from 1754 initiated a politically artistic revolution in America. It contained a snake cut into eight pieces, with the colonies/regions listed beside each slithering section. It was an early example of our disunity, something that worried Franklin. He wrote an accompanying editorial explaining the need to keep the young nation together. The founding father’s memorable political cartoon still gets used as a symbol of American freedom.

Thomas Nast, who is considered the father of the genre here in the United States, was described by art historian Albert Boime as wielding "more influence than any other artist of the 19th century.” This assessment was due to his one-man campaign against political corruption, especially that of William "Boss" Tweed’s thuggish cohort, which took control of the Democratic Party political machine called Tammany Hall. Nast’s thunderous cartoon “The Brains” in 1871, which showed Tweed’s body with a sack of money for a head, ended the corrupt politician's career. "His impact on American public life,” wrote Boime, “was formidable enough to profoundly affect the outcome of every presidential election during the period 1864 to 1884.”
Many talented cartoonists either dabbled or specialized in political work in the mid-20th century. Winsor McCay ("Little Nemo"), Percy Crosby ("Skippy"), Bill Watterson ("Calvin and Hobbes"), Berkeley Breathed ("Bloom County"), Walt Kelly ("Pogo"), and Theodor “Dr. Seuss” Geisel all turned their hands to this visual form of editorializing. Jeff MacNelly ("Shoe"), Bill Mauldin ("Willie and Joe"), Daniel Fitzpatrick, Paul Hancock, and Herbert “Herblock” Block also made important contributions.
Modern editorial cartoonists continued the tradition of opening an imaginary window to explore topics, all with the ability to intrigue and infuriate society. Politicians on the Left and the Right became little emperors with no clothes. Business leaders were either praised or savaged for their support of capitalism, free markets, and the almighty dollar. War and the military emphasized moments of great heroism when the Allies defeated the Axis powers in World War II, as well as sobering viewpoints when U.S. troops went to Vietnam.
[Opinion: The New York Times, which published the Congress Jew tracker in 2015, is sorry for distributing anti-Semitic cartoon]
There are still some fine political cartoonists, such as Michael Ramirez, Rex “Baloo” May, and Scott Stantis on the Right; and Pat Oliphant, Tom Toles, and Jules Feiffer on the Left. But in truth, the state of the industry is dismal, and the golden age ended long ago.
Why is this happening? It's not as though politics has simmered down and there is no controversy worth skewering or politician worth lampooning.
Decline can be attributed partly to cost-cutting. More and more readers are turning away from print to online reading, and at the same time, the infinite space online means advertising rates are a fraction of what they used to be. Declining readership and revenues mean cartoonist jobs are becoming rarer and rarer.
As NPR’s Sylvia Maria Gross pointed out more than a decade ago, “In the 1980s, there were about 300 staff cartoonists at newspapers around the country. Now there are fewer than a hundred. Newspapers are grappling with a steep decline in advertising revenue and trying to reinvent themselves online.” In turn, it’s led to the elimination of newspaper positions such as full-time political cartoonists. Newspapers rely more on subscription services to acquire cartoons instead of utilizing in-house talent.
The intense fight for readers and fear of losing them have made editors more cautious. Political cartoonist Daryl Cagle, in 2018, wrote in the Masthead, a journal of the American Society of News Editors, "Editors prefer cartoons, drawn in a traditional style, which do not express a strong opinion that some readers might disagree with.” A notable example was the case of Iowa-based Farm News, which fired Rick Friday in 2016 after a seed firm withdrew its advertising in protest over a cartoon that pointed out that corporations such as Monsanto, John Deere, and DuPont Pioneer made more money than all the farmers in Iowa put together. The New York Times covered the resulting fuss, and the Des Moines Register called Friday a “free-speech martyr.” Farm News rehired Friday 60 days later, but some of the damage was already done.
Another reason for the decline of political cartoons is widespread frustration with Washington and the political culture. Many members of the public are fed up with the all-consuming nature of today's politics, and many of them have turned to topics that have nothing to do with Republicans and Democrats. Caricatures of President Trump’s hair and weight are still in demand, but the well will run dry before long.
Sarah Boxer wrote in the Atlantic’s April 2018 issue that political cartooning has become surprisingly “tricky in the age of Trump.” The president is a big and tempting target for the pen-and-ink community, but Boxer wondered whether cartoonists would be “moved enough” to go after him in the same way others of an earlier epoch savaged President Richard Nixon during the Watergate scandal. "Standards of caricature are different” in America, she noted, because there were ways of depicting President George W. Bush that, for racial reasons, no cartoonist would use to caricature President Barack Obama.
The irony is that in our increasingly visual society, political cartoons should be more popular than ever among readers young and old. I've read and studied comic strips of all genres for decades, and I hope they can survive and even thrive. But cartoons need to be brave, irreverent, and sometimes outrageous, qualities that have been cowed in this epoch of heightened sensitivities, picky readers, and cash-strapped publications.

Texto completo: Several inmates at a South Carolina prison will be facing charges after officials found out they were posting a live video stream from inside the facility, according to a Tuesday tweet from the S.C. Department of Corrections.
Department officials were tipped off about the livestream and found the inmates responsible at Lee Correctional Institution, a maximum security prison located in Bishopville, according to the tweet.
Investigators confiscated the phones inmates were using to do the livestream, according to the tweet. Officials are in the process of filing charges against the inmates.
It's unclear how many inmates were involved.
Officials are not sure how the inmates were able to get around a system used at Lee Correctional to block cellphone service at the prison, according to the tweet.
The Department employed a managed access system in the wake of the deadly riot at Lee Correctional in April 2018, which left seven men dead. The system is supposed to stop any phone that is not white-listed from getting a signal to send texts, place calls or connect to the internet.
The Department of Corrections obtained the system as part of a three-year $1.5 million contract with Tecore Networks.
"This is one more reason we need to pass legislation to jam cellphone signals," the department Tweeted.
Prison officials have struggled to get cellphone use under control within South Carolina's prison system for years. They blamed the prolific use of phones and other contraband for the riot at Lee Correctional.
In April, the Department of Corrections tested a new cellphone-jamming technology at Broad River Correctional in Columbia in an attempt to improve their system.
"The technology works," Director Bryan Stirling said in a statement at the time. "This has the ability to change everything and make prisons safer for everyone."
Stirling and others at the department have long pushed for jamming technology, which is currently banned under federal law, to become legal.

Capturing What's Online in China Before It Vanishes

Texto completo: How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Raymond Zhong, a technology reporter based in Beijing, discussed the tech he's using.
What are your most important tech tools for reporting in China?
The Chinese internet is like the small-town setting of a crime novel: Things are mysteriously disappearing from it all the time.
Social media posts vanish. News and blog articles are taken down. Sensitive bits are excised from videos. You can't always predict what will be removed, either by censors or by a regular person starting to have second thoughts about his or her own unfiltered utterance. Even pages on the websites of government agencies and major corporations have a way of quietly falling into black holes.
That's why a Google Chrome extension called Full Page Screen Capture is invaluable for internet research in China. With one click, I get a screen shot of an entire page, top to bottom. An embarrassingly large share of the files on my laptop are PDFs generated this way. I only wish a similar function were built into my iPhone, as it is on Huawei handsets.
Google sometimes caches past versions of web pages, as does the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine. These crawlers don't preserve everything. But when you manage to discover in the archives the exact page you've been hunting for, frozen for posterity at exactly the right moment, it's an incredible endorphin rush.
For capturing streaming videos before they are taken down, I use QuickTime Player to take a recording of my screen. There are also sites that convert videos from YouTube and other platforms into downloadable files. I won't name these services. The video sites don't like them, so they're constantly being shut down.
Reporting in an authoritarian country is a struggle of memory against forgetting. These tools help.
How does online consumerism like shopping and ordering food delivery differ there? How do you personally use these apps?
I spent most of my adult life not buying much online except books. But, oh Lordy, have I fallen for e-commerce since moving to Beijing last year.
To scroll through Taobao, Alibaba's largest shopping platform, is to be awed by the sheer amount of our physical world that is being produced in China. Normal stuff like dustpans and kitchen timers. Weird stuff like latte cups shaped like skulls, wine glasses with a built-in straw and Barbie dolls that serve as racks for slices of raw meat before they go into a hot pot. Detailed knockoffs of Lego sets and whatever latest abominable thing Justin Bieber has been photographed wearing.
Do you know how many vendors are out there selling giant pillows printed to look like pieces of grilled meat? I bet that you do not.
My head swims with grandiose thoughts when I'm on Taobao. Thoughts like: Factories are making this stuff because people buy it. Who are these people? How do the factories even find out about them? What if shopping apps, and not social media, are the real mirror that mobile technology is holding up to our society?
Come to think of it, I still don't buy that much online. I just like to look and ponder.
Many people in China have stopped using cash. They conduct their entire lives on a single app, WeChat . Electric cars are everywhere. Is China "The Jetsons"?
No, though I do often see people on hoverboards barreling down city streets while talking on their cellphones.
China is rightly recognized for having made big leaps in the digital realm. But there are many unglamorous reasons behind Chinese tech companies' success.
Labor is cheap, and cities are densely populated -- perfect for e-commerce, ride-hailing, and food and grocery delivery. People also tend to adopt new technologies with gusto because in a country that was quite poor not long ago, it's not easy to get misty eyed about life before the internet.
The offline world in China is still rough in some ways. The skies are polluted. The traffic is bad. Staffs in shops and restaurants are surly. Most people will happily use technology to avoid all this if they can.
A few months ago, I had a broken water pipe at home, and for some reason I decided to call a plumber who had left his number on a sticker in my building. He ripped me off, big time. Next time I'm trying an app.
Even dealing with the Chinese bureaucracy is getting less torturous, sort of. This year, the tax authorities want more people to use their app. Which sounds good, except I still had to go across town and show my passport to get the six-digit code needed to activate the app.
Hoverboards aside, what gadget trends are emerging?
In a country as gadget crazy as China, it's interesting that smart speakers aren't taking off as they are in the United States. A lot of people I know are buying hand-held voice translation devices, usually for older relatives. They don't work so well, I'm told. But at least they try to solve a real problem.
Recently, I watched a waiter in a hotel restaurant communicate with foreign guests using a voice translation app. "China needs to get better at English to become stronger in the world," the waiter said, and the app read out his words in English.
It was all very poignant -- until one guest barked at the waiter about a broken juice machine, and the app dutifully translated his insults into Chinese.
Outside of your job, what tech product are you personally obsessed with? What's so great about it, and what could be better?
China is a glorious place to be a karaoke lover, and Exhibit No. 1 is the nation's ubiquitous karaoke booths. For a couple of bucks, you and a friend can squeeze into a soundproof glass box and sing your hearts out for 15 minutes before going back to your normal lives.
The booths are everywhere in Chinese cities. In malls, in movie theaters. I've even seen them outside factories, so workers can nip out for a rousing round of "My Way" before returning to the assembly line. One time, I saw people singing in booths at the Beijing airport at 6:30 in the morning.
I must say I like the idea of karaoke booths more than the actual experience. The ventilation isn't great. You have to wear headphones, and there's something about karaoke that is diminished when you experience it through headphones. Or maybe I just don't sound as good singing "Try a Little Tenderness" as I think I do.
In the end, karaoke might be another thing that was probably best left undisrupted by technology.

Texto completo: Una vez más queda en evidencia el tipo de presidente que tiene EEUU. Donald Trump defendió la forma en que logró evitar el pago de millones de dólares en impuestos durante más de diez años.
En contra de cualquier lógica el presidente Donald Trump respondió este miércoles al informe del New York Times que dijo que las cifras de sus impuestos desde 1985 hasta 1994 mostraron asombrosas pérdidas empresariales de más de 1,000 millones de dólares.
“Siempre quiso mostrar pérdidas a efectos fiscales … casi todos los promotores inmobiliarios lo hicieron, y con frecuencia volvieron a negociar con los bancos, fue un deporte”, dijo Trump en un par de tweets de la madrugada. “¡Además, la información muy antigua que se publicó es un trabajo muy incorrecto en las noticias falsas!”
Real estate developers in the 1980’s & 1990’s, more than 30 years ago, were entitled to massive write offs and depreciation which would, if one was actively building, show losses and tax losses in almost all cases. Much was non monetary. Sometimes considered “tax shelter,” ……
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 8, 2019
….you would get it by building, or even buying. You always wanted to show losses for tax purposes….almost all real estate developers did – and often re-negotiate with banks, it was sport. Additionally, the very old information put out is a highly inaccurate Fake News hit job!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 8, 2019
El diario neoyorquino obtuvo la información fiscal de Trump, incluidas las impresiones de sus transcripciones oficiales de impuestos del IRS, de 1985 a 1994.
El periódico dijo que los datos extraídos de las impresiones de los recibos del IRS de Trump mostraron que perdió dinero cada año durante el período de 10 años, por una pérdida acumulada de $1.17 mil millones en total. The Times también dijo que Trump no pagó impuestos sobre la renta durante ocho de esos 10 años.
Al parecer, Trump perdió más dinero que cualquier otro contribuyente individual en todo EEUU, según el análisis de los datos de la investigación que el IRS ha compilado sobre las personas que ganan grandes ingresos.
Trump, sin embargo, sugirió que sus tácticas de “refugio fiscal” eran normales para el curso en los años 80 y 90, y dijo en sus tweets de la mañana del miércoles que los promotores inmobiliarios como él “tenían derecho a amortizaciones masivas y depreciación que, de ser así, Construyendo activamente, mostrar pérdidas y pérdidas fiscales en casi todos los casos “.
Queda claro una vez más la razón por la que Trump está inmerso en una batalla legal a muerte para evitar que se conozcan sus devoluciones de impuestos recientes, las cuales dejarían claro el origen de sus finanzas, sus nexos con gobiernos y oligarcas internacionales y demás maniobras para evitar el pago de impuestos.
Por su parte en Nueva York la legislatura estatal avanzó este miércoles un proyecto de ley que permitiría al Congreso obtener las declaraciones de impuestos estatales del magnate.
De igual forma legisladores en otros 17 estados también están tratando de obtener las declaraciones de impuestos de Trump antes de las elecciones de 2020.
Actualmente cursan en las distintas legislaturas estatales proyectos de ley que obligan a los candidatos presidenciales a hacer públicos los últimos cinco años de sus devoluciones de impuestos si quieren estar en la boleta electoral en 2020.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump reportedly lost more than $1 billion over a ten-year period -- and he avoided paying taxes for eight years during that time due to the losses.
The revelation comes amid a brewing battle between Democrats in Congress and the Trump administration about lawmakers' access to the president's tax returns for 2013-2018.
In 1985, Trump reported losses of $46. 1 million from his businesses, which included his casinos, hotels and retail space in apartment buildings, according to a report from the New York Times. The majority of his losses came between 1990 and 1991, when he lost more than $250 million each year, the Times reported.
In all, between 1985 to 1994, Trump lost $1. 17 billion, according to the Times.
As a result of his losses, the New York businessman did not have to pay taxes for eight of the 10 years, the Times also reported. The newspaper did not analyze Trump's official tax returns, but transcripts of those documents.
The White House did not respond to request for comment.
Representatives for Trump repeatedly pushed back on the bombshell report.

A senior official in a statement initially told the Times that Trump "got massive depreciation and tax shelter because of large-scale construction and subsidized developments" and claimed that is why Trump has called for changes to the tax laws.

However, Trump's lawyer, Charles Harder, in a statement issued to the Times Saturday criticized the paper's characterization of Trump's tax information, saying it was "demonstrably false" and the paper's reporting was "highly inaccurate. "
On Tuesday, Harder issued another statement claiming that IRS transcripts "particularly before the days of electronic filing are notoriously inaccurate. " The president's lawyer, however, did not provide any specific errors in the information reported by Times.
A former director of research, analysis and statistics at the IRS, Mark Mazur, told the Times that the transcripts are "handy" summaries of tax returns that have been used to analyze economic trends and set national policy and had gone through quality control for decades.
In addition, the Times reported that its source provided transcripts of the tax returns of Fred Trump, the president's father, which the newspaper was able to verify against the father's actual tax returns because of its previous investigation and reporting.
The report comes amid a fight between the Trump administration and Democratic lawmakers in the House who are seeking to obtain the president's 2013-2018 tax returns.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Monday rejected a request from House Democrats to obtain Trump's tax returns from the IRS, which is part of the Treasury Department.

Rep. Richard Neal, D-Mass. , who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, last month requested the president's tax returns since 2013.
Mnuchin called the request "unprecedented" and claimed it "presents serious constitutional questions. " He denied the request per guidance from the Department of Justice, and contended that "the Committee's request lacks a legitimate legislative purpose. "

Texto completo: Strawberries were dying. The red berries were once a profitable crop in Sussex County, but by the 1920s, the soil was so depleted that many farms could no longer support strawberries as cash crop. Many growers were abandoning strawberries when help came from an unexpected source.
In 1874, the New York Times reported, "Strawberries, which next to peaches are the great fruit crop of the (Delmarva) peninsula." Strawberries do not ripen after they are harvested; the fruit needs to be left on the vine until it is at the peak of its juicy freshness. Consequently, the berries had to be picked and shipped quickly.
When the strawberries began to ripen, crowds of pickers were recruited from the slums of the big cities to harvest the fruit. The pickers often arrived in the fields at three in the morning; and working by the light of oil lamps, they spent hours hunched over, plucking strawberries and loading them into small baskets.
The baskets were packed onto horse-drawn wagons which carried the delicate fruit to Selbyville, Millsboro, and other southern Delaware rail depots, where the berries were loaded into newly-developed refrigerated railroad cars.
The cold-packing in refrigerated cars was the secret to keeping the fruit from rotting. When strawberries were being harvested, buyers flooded into Selbyville, where they erected tents along the town's streets so that they could be ready at sunup, when the first wagonloads of strawberries arrived in town.
The wagons lined up at the auction block on Church Street and from there, the berries were taken to the railroad station for shipment to big city markets.
Raising strawberries in Sussex County peaked in the early years of the 20th century. The soil had become depleted, and by the beginning of the 1920s, many growers had turned to other crops.
The completion of the Du Pont Highway in 1923, however, revived the strawberry crop in southern Delaware.
Two years after the highway was finished, the Wilmington Sunday Star reported, "Rumors from Georgetown that Sussex County farmers were going to abandon the raising of strawberries because ... the soil had failed to properly nourish them, are laughed at by the farmers whose crops of strawberries for years have one of their best paying enterprises."
Strawberry growers had learned to fertilize their strawberry patches to prevent the nutrients in the soil from becoming depleted. In addition, the completion of the Du Pont Highway provided growers a way to truck their berries to market. Instead of shipping strawberries in refrigerated railroad cars, growers packed the berries in large "cold-packed" barrels loaded onto trucks.
According to the Sunday Star, "The cold pack process is one that each farmer keeps a secret unto himself. They each have their own particular way of packing the berries into huge barrels, the same size as vinegar barrels.
"The general method followed is to pack sound berries between successive layers of granulated sugar. The barrel is sealed and made airtight, and if properly done, it is said the berries will last indefinitely.
"These are the strawberries you eat in November and December in your ice cream and sometimes in your sundae over the soda fountain. But only good sound berries are used, because if the fruit should be soft or the least bit decayed, it might spoil the entire barrel."
The unexpected combination of the new Du Pont Highway and sugary cold-packing enabled the strawberry crop to remain an important crop in southern Delaware for the next 15 years.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — In an interview with NPR's "Morning Edition" today, Jill Biden told host Rachel Martin that "it's time to move on" from the controversy over her husband Joe Biden's handling of Anita Hill's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
After starting his presidential campaign, Biden called Hill to apologize. Hill says that his apology is not enough.
“I cannot be satisfied by simply saying, ‘I’m sorry for what happened to you,’” said Hill to the New York Times in April. “I will be satisfied when I know that there is real change and real accountability and real purpose. ”
Joe Biden: On Anita Hill: 'I don't think I treated her badly'
Not 'satisfied': Anita Hill responds after Joe Biden expressed regret over Clarence Thomas hearings, report says
When asked why Joe Biden did not call to apologize until after he started his presidential campaign, Jill Biden responded that "Well, I guess it was just not the right time maybe. So, he wanted to call her. I think he didn't know whether she would take his call. "
Despite Hill's objections to the apology, Jill Biden believes that Joe Biden's apology should suffice.
"As he has said, I mean he's called Anita Hill, they've talked, they've spoken, and he said, you know, he feels badly," Jill Biden said. "He apologized for the way the hearings were run. And so now it's kind of — it's time to move on. "
According to Jill Biden, it was Joe Biden's decision alone to call Anita Hill to apologize for his conduct.
In October 1991, Anita Hill testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, chaired by Senator Joe Biden, about sexual harassment allegations against then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas. In graphic detail, Hill described Thomas' alleged misconduct during her time working with Thomas at the Department of Education and the Equal Opportunity Employment Commission.
Biden has faced criticism since then for not calling corroborating witnesses to support Hill's testimony, despite the willingness of several women to do so at the time. Thomas' nomination was referred out of committee, and he was later confirmed to the Court by a 52-48 vote.

Gentrification isn't America's urban scourge. Poverty is. [Corrected 05/08/2019]

Texto completo: First, the good news. More white Americans want to live in heavily black neighborhoods. A 2016 paper by the National University of Singapore's Kwan Ok Lee found that since 1990, neighborhood segregation by race declined. Even better, mixed white-black neighborhoods have tended to stay mixed, instead of resulting in white flight or displacement of black residents. This trend isn't true in every area of the country, but it's quite a change from the mid-20th century, when whites fled mixed neighborhoods en masse to more segregated suburbs.
Now for the not-so-good news. A recent investigation by The New York Times confirmed the trend of white people moving into black neighborhoods. But it also found a disturbing pattern. When a neighborhood is diversified by an influx of nonwhite people, the newcomers' incomes tend to be about average for that neighborhood. But when white people move into a mostly nonwhite neighborhood, their incomes tend to be much higher than the local average.
Although gentrification tends to improve neighborhood amenities, it also can cause difficulties for longtime residents of poor minority communities. Gentrifiers may be more likely to call the police on their neighbors. New retail outlets can change the character of a neighborhood. And most importantly, housing prices tend to rise, putting pressure on those of modest income. The biggest worry related to gentrification is that it will result in displacement.
For some low-income residents in the country's so-called superstar cities, this is the reality. A study by the nonprofit National Community Reinvestment Coalition found that from 2000 through 2013, displacement of longtime residents was heavily concentrated in big cities with strong economies.
But overall, gentrification isn't a big source of displacement. Some studies have found no evidence of increased exit of low-income residents from gentrifying neighborhoods. The NCRC study did find about 135,000 black and Hispanic people displaced by gentrification over the 13 years they studied, mostly in the superstar cities like New York and Washington. And they guess that the true number is somewhat larger. But in a country of more than 300 million people, 135,000 is a very small number. Meanwhile, a 2009 study by urban-planning researcher Lance Freeman found that gentrification didn't decrease neighborhood diversity.
So although gentrification displaces a few low-income minority Americans, this isn't a widespread phenomenon, and it isn't leading to resegregation -- if anything, it appears to be modestly reversing the effects of white flight. Of course, rising housing costs are still a burden for those who aren't displaced, which is part of a more general crisis of affordability in the country's more desirable cities. And higher rents deter poor minority Americans from moving to economically healthy neighborhoods. The government should be doing all it can to bring down housing costs.
But the phenomenon of gentrification tends to distract urbanists, reporters and policymakers from the bigger problem afflicting American cities -- concentrated poverty. Even as a few superstar cities see influxes of well-to-do residents, many more are languishing in neglect and decay.
A 2019 study by the University of Minnesota Law School's Institute on Metropolitan Opportunity found that for poor Americans, concentration of poverty and local decline were much more common outcomes than gentrification. Since 2000, the study reports, 36.5 million Americans have experienced both local economic decline and an increase in the number of poor people living nearby. It found that the low-income population of economically declining regions has grown by more than 5 million in that time.
Ohio urban planner Jason Segedy is frustrated by the lack of attention to this trend:
"Many well-intentioned people ... worry so much about the potential downside of urban revitalization, that they are overlooking the far greater challenges of inter-generational poverty, uneven economic growth, disinvestment, abandonment, negative-net-growth urban sprawl, and pervasive and entrenched racial and economic segregation."
Segedy is right. Concentrated poverty, especially in declining towns and cities such as Detroit and Cleveland, is a much bigger problem than gentrification. But because the former is an old, well-known phenomenon while the latter is a newer trend, attention is naturally drawn to the latter. This is dangerous, because excessive worry about the potential harms from gentrification might cause some policymakers to discourage investment in poor minority communities, out of fear of displacement. But discouraging that investment would cause many more problems than it would prevent.
Instead, policymakers should try to manage and alleviate the strains of gentrification, while continuing to vigorously attack concentrated poverty. Policies to encourage investment in poor minority neighborhoods, like the successful Empowerment Zone program that began under President Bill Clinton and expired in 2016, should be maintained and expanded. Just because a problem is old doesn't mean it can be safely forgotten.

Texto completo: On April 4, Fox News hosted a heavily hyped town hall event with former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz. Even though he was born and raised in New York City, Schultz’s path to the Fox News studios in Manhattan has been a strange journey indeed.
Perhaps most folks would have assumed that such an event would only have occurred on a left-leaning station, such as MSNBC, CNN, or CNBC. After all, Schultz is a lifelong Democrat who has helped elect liberal politicians for decades. He endorsed Barack Obama for president. He endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. At the helm of Starbucks, he steered the company dramatically to the left. He railed against President Trump’s orders on immigration and travel, vowing to hire 10,000 refugees. He pushed liberal policies on climate change and healthcare, and even told an investor to sell his stock simply because that shareholder supported traditional marriage.
But even a lifetime of liberal virtuosity is not enough to buy Howard Schultz penance in today’s Democratic Party. His fall from grace started in January, when Schultz told "60 Minutes" that he was considering running for president in 2020 — as an independent.
Immediately, the same liberals he had supported for decades turned their backs on Howard. Overnight, he was without a home.
And the Left’s rage at Schultz burns strong. For example, New York Times columnist Paul Krugman claims that Schultz is a plutocrat who is trying to undermine the resistance to Trump. Some on the Left have threatened to boycott Starbucks, causing the hashtag #BoycottStarbucks to trend on social media. Former Obama administration official Brandon Friedman attacked Schultz for comments he made about growing up in poverty and then ascending to the CEO of a major company. Friedman said, “If you ‘grew up in the projects,’ then you’re not ‘self-made.’ The ‘projects’ are taxpayer-funded public housing. Your friends, neighbors, family members and millions of Americans you never met all worked and paid their taxes so that you wouldn’t have to grow up homeless.”
Outwardly, many on the Left are claiming they oppose Schultz because they fear an independent bid may help reelect Trump. Obama’s 2012 campaign manager Jim Messina summed it up this way: “He can't win, and he could seriously damage our ability to beat Donald Trump. He should either run as a Democrat or spend his time and money doing something that won’t ruin the world.”
While Messina’s hyperbolic position may be the outward reason for the Left’s hostility toward Schultz, there is another deeper issue: the Left’s embrace of socialism.
Schultz is a billionaire who made his money via capitalism. Like it or not, the behemoth corporate titan that is Starbucks, he built that. To today’s progressive, the B- and C-words are verboten.
Schultz has indicated that if he runs as an independent, it would be in response to extreme socialist ideas pushed by the likes of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. Schultz has called the socialist embrace of "Medicare for All" pushes “not American,” has said the Green New Deal is “not realistic,” and has pushed back on proposals for sky-high income tax rates.
Schultz may be a lefty, but he seems aware of the perils of socialism.
According to the White House Council of Economic Advisers report titled “The Opportunity Costs of Socialism,” the potential real-world effects of these policies are frightening. If the United States implemented "Medicare for All," “GDP would fall by 9 percent, or about $7,000 per person in 2022, due to high tax rates that would reduce incentives to supply the factors of production. Evidence on the productivity and effectiveness of single-payer systems suggests that ‘Medicare for All’ would reduce both short- and long-run longevity and health.” The report further concludes that “U.S. GDP would decline by about $11,000 per year per person if 1970s-style Nordic policies were in place, and by $24,000 per year if ‘highly socialist’ policies were in place.”
As Schultz says, socialist policies are “misinformed.”
Soon after his announcement in January, Schultz did a town hall-style event on CNN. It didn’t go well for Schultz or CNN. For even daring to host Schultz in the first place, CNN was pilloried by the far Left.
If a known leftist such as Schultz can’t stomach the policy platform of today’s liberals, it’s safe to say the American Left has embraced socialism a bit too tightly. Yet conservatives, like elephants, have long memories. And the Right won’t soon forget Schultz’s support for far-left politicians and the liberal policies of Starbucks.
Alas, Howard finds himself a man without a home.

Texto completo: Joe Biden finally stopped drawing out his decision to enter the presidential race to confront Donald Trump in 2020. He was the 20th Democratic candidate at that point.
According to a Morning Consulting/Politico poll, Biden is not only leading the rest of the Democratic field, but he also has an edge over Trump at this point. The poll found: "Biden leading the president by eight percentage points in a hypothetical matchup, 42% to 34%. Biden has a significant edge over Trump among women (17 points), millennials (22 points) and independents (10 points)."
This is welcome news for many Democrats, particularly established ones, whose main, if not only, objective is to defeat Trump.
Biden is a solid candidate with years of experience, but, like many candidates, he has pros and cons. He has a long legislative history of congressional leadership, and has evolved in the right direction on some important issues. But he also has a history of being "handsy" with women, did not treat Anita Hill terribly well during her testimony at Clarence Thomas' confirmation hearing and led the charge on the disastrous 1994 crime bill.
People will have to wrestle with his history as they wrestle with the history of other candidates, or for the younger candidates, a lack of long history.
But there is part of the Biden enthusiasm, and to a lesser extent the energy around candidates like Bernie Sanders, that focuses too heavily on the fickle white, working-class swing voters and is not enough focused on the party's faithful.
Barack Obama ran phenomenal campaigns in 2008 and 2012, and there is no doubt that choosing Biden, an elder white man, helped grease the skids among a certain section of white working-class voters. But, these are the same people who in the next breath - or next election - could reverse course and vote for a flagrant white supremacist.
These people are not experiencing conversion, they are being coddled. Democrats want to hold constant their support from women and minorities even as they chase the votes of people hostile to the interests of women and minorities. What does it say that the Democrats lust after disaffection rather than rewarding devotion?
Democratic candidates would be much better served focusing on energizing new voters among constituencies amenable to this philosophy and these goals, rather than bending to accommodate voters who vacillate between open contempt for those interests and begrudging countenance of them.
The way people obsess over white, working-class voters, one would think that they are an overwhelming portion of the electorate. They aren't.
A 2017 study by Johns Hopkins University researchers Stephen L. Morgan and Jiwon Lee found that non-Hispanic white voters totaled 69.3% of the electorate in 2016. The percentage of that total who were working class was just 18.6%.
Conversely, blacks and Hispanics together, voters who overwhelming and consistently support Democrats, accounted for 20% of all votes cast in 2016.
Furthermore, according to exit polls, the Democratic presidential candidate hasn't won the white vote in the whole history of those polls being conducted.
And yet, we are fated to an unending obsession about courting those voters, about their worries and anxieties, about their propensity to angrily storm off if they don't feel properly exalted and centered.
At some point, the leadership and the front-runner are going to have to explain to women and minorities why their inordinate focus on white, working-class voters is justified, and that explanation will have to extend beyond, "It's the only way."
That explanation no longer has currency. "Anything to defeat Trump" is also not a soothing elixir. At some point, the loyal constituencies will demand to know: "What's in it for us, specifically?" And I don't blame them.

Texto completo: Character actress Rebecca Schull became a familiar face to TV viewers during a long run on the '90s ensemble comedy "Wings." She played Fay, an endearingly quirky widow who runs an airline-ticket counter.
Schull has worked steadily since that show ended 22 years ago in a variety of projects, but her latest role is about as far as you can get from a cheerful network sitcom. In the big-screen drama "The Last," she plays Claire, a beloved 92-year-old Jewish matriarch who shocks her family with a startling revelation: She was a member of the Nazi party during World War II, working as a nurse in Auschwitz.
Needless to say, it's not the kind of role the actress gets a script for every day.
"I had some very mixed feelings at the beginning," says Schull, calling from Venice, California, before a promotional event. "She's a very bizarre character in some sense, but I think that Jeff Lipsky has written a very believable story, and it's very shocking as it's portrayed."
There were some issues to consider with the film. Most importantly, Schull herself is Jewish, so the role stirred up some difficult emotions.
"In order to make it credible for anybody listening to her, you have to believe in her and accept her," she says. "That doesn't mean from the outside that I accept the things she says. Some of them are really horrific. But I have to look at it from her vantage point and consider all that she went through."
In Lipsky's film (he also directs), Claire was abandoned for the first part of her life and relied on a Nazi doctor who became her protector. He brings her to Auschwitz, then she eventually leaves for the United States, disguised as a Jewish refugee.
Even though her family has been raised in the Jewish faith, Claire remains a virulent anti-Semite. "There are two sides to every battle," the character explains.
"The hardest thing about what she says is not her history, but that for all these years, she has lived as a Jewish woman with a loving Jewish family, and she's still very anti-Semitic," Schull says.
Making Claire real It is obviously a demanding role, and Schull's delicately layered performance makes you buy in to a premise that can seem a bit far-fetched. But you believe her, so you believe the film.
Her skills are on display in a remarkable monologue that lasts about 45 minutes. She is enjoying a day at the beach with her great-grandson and his wife when she decides to spill all her secrets — and her Nazi past is just the beginning of what she has kept under wraps.
"I guess I approached it in the way I would approach any other role," Schull says. "There was a lot to learn. I had to learn that huge monologue. There's something about the acting process when you get to repeat to yourself over and over what a character is saying that in some way it kind of infiltrates into your own being. For you to feel comfortable saying those things, you have to find a way that resonates, that seems real and natural and spontaneous.
"While you do that, while you're learning, a kind of osmosis happens. I wouldn't say I took on her character – God forbid! – but you find a way to make that character become part of yourself, or vice versa."
Claire speaks with a convincing European accent, a touch that was Schull's idea.
"Jeff didn't want an accent, but I felt it would help me," she says. "The more you can sort of define a character in idiosyncratic ways ... if you can develop some sort of texture, it helps create them. It was very helpful to have the accent; it helped me. And it was fun to do."
Schull's history with her director She's worked with Lipsky before on such films as "Molly's Theory of Relativity" and "Twelve Thirty," though Claire is biggest showcase she's had in one of his projects.
"I don't think it was written for me," she says. "I know that I was the first and only person that Jeff asked to do it, but I don't know whether he had me in mind when he wrote it."
She enjoys working with the filmmaker, who shot the movie over 12 days. His films all boast a very singular style.
"He says his main theme is really working families and the generations in families and the conflicts that are from that. But as far as working with him, his enterprises are always very low-budget. You work very quickly but very efficiently. It all runs quite smoothly."
Remembering 'Wings' Schull didn't begin acting until she was in her 40s. She moved with her husband to Dublin and began studying the Stanislavsky method. She made her Broadway debut in 1976 in "Herzl." Later came work in film and TV before "Wings" began an eight-season run in 1990 on NBC.
"It's kind of amazing that we finished that show over 20 years ago, and people still recognize me," she says.
She never felt typecast as Fay, perhaps one reason she looks back on the show so fondly.
"It was a marvelous experience," she says. "The producers were wonderful, the cast was wonderful, everyone got on very well. The whole atmosphere on the set was marvelous. Nobody complained; there were no tantrums. It all went very smoothly, very pleasantly.
"The great thing about doing a show like that is you laugh a lot. You go to work and you laugh a lot, and not a lot of people can say that."
A 90-year-old working actress At 90, the New York-based actress is two years younger than the woman she plays in "The Last." She acknowledges that roles as meaty as Claire don't come around very often at her age.
"Parts are few and far between at this stage," she says. "I accept that and I have no complaints about my career. Having started as late as I did, and then to have the success with something like 'Wings' and to do other things that were really interesting – I can't complain."
Now is certainly a sweet time. She's been receiving amazing reviews for "The Last" (the New York Times calls her "spectacular"), and she enjoys the acclaim.
"It's lovely," she says with a laugh. "It's much better than a kick in the pants."

'Heartbeat bills' intensify debate concerning abortion

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- While constitutional lawyers, ethicists and theologians -- in descending order of importance in the abortion debate -- have been arguing in the 46 years since the Supreme Court attempted to settle the debate, some technologists have been making a consequential contribution to it. They have developed machines that produce increasingly vivid sonograms of fetal development. This concreteness partially explains the intensification of the debate.
Six states have passed "heartbeat bills" to ban abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detectable, approximately six weeks after conception. Such bills are, indeed, unconstitutional given the court's Roe ukase that abortion cannot be restricted before a fetus is viable outside the womb -- which means, presumably, before the fetus is a child.
But why should "viability" be the dispositive criterion? Viable means capable of surviving outside the womb, which no infant can do without constant help that others must give. Must. No infants are "viable" in that all are helpless, and the law requires that help be given by those responsible for the infant.
A New York Times editorial (Dec. 28, 2018) opposing the idea that "a fetus in the womb has the same rights as a fully formed person" spoke of these living fetuses -- that they are living is an elementary biological fact, not an abstruse theological deduction -- as "clusters of cells that have not yet developed into viable human beings." Now, delete the obfuscating and constitutionally irrelevant adjective "viable," and look at a sonogram of a 10-week fetus. Note the eyes and lips, the moving fingers and, yes, the beating heart. Is this most suitably described as a "cluster of cells" or as a baby? The cluster-of-cells contingent resembles Chico Marx in the movie "Duck Soup": "Who ya gonna believe, me or your own eyes?"
The "heartbeat bills" are wholesome provocations: One of their aims is to provoke thinking about the moral dimension of extinguishing a being with a visibly beating heart. Furthermore, pro-life people are being provoked in different ways.
Last month, Kansas' Supreme Court found in this from the state constitution -- "All men are possessed of equal and inalienable natural rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" -- a reason to overturn the state's ban on D&E (dilation-and-evacuation) abortions that involve dismemberment of the living fetus. In February, after Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker signed an executive order to enforce taxpayer-funded abortions, Democratic legislators decided that not even that was enough. They introduced a bill to create a right to abortion for any reason at any point in a pregnancy, a bill similar to legislation enacted or advancing in other Democratic-controlled states. In February, all but three Democratic U.S. senators opposed, thereby killing, Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse's Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act that would have required, in the rare cases in which a child survives a botched abortion procedure, that the survivor receive the standard professional care that would be given to any child born alive at the same gestational age.
The 1850s debates that propelled Abraham Lincoln to greatness concerned not whether slavery should be abolished forthwith, which was neither a constitutional nor political possibility. Rather, the debates concerned two other questions: Would national policy stigmatize slavery as a tragic legacy and a moral wrong? And: Would policy confine slavery to its existing dominion by banning it from the territories, thereby, Lincoln thought, putting it on a path to ultimate extinction?
Temperate pro-life advocates, practicing Lincolnian prudence, consider the abortion debate akin to the slavery debates for three reasons: Abortion shrinks the scope of the concept of personhood. The issue has been inflamed by judicial fiat (Roe v. Wade as Dred Scott v. Sandford). And confining a morally objectionable practice is a worthy, albeit not fully satisfying, objective.
The changed composition of the Supreme Court, and the supposed imminent danger that Roe will be overturned, is the excuse that pro-abortion extremists have seized upon to do what they want to do anyway: to normalize extreme abortion practices expressive of the belief that never does fetal life have more moral significance than a tumor in a mother's stomach. (Most European nations restrict abortions by at least week 13. France and Germany are very restrictive after 12, Sweden after 18.) The court's new composition has encouraged some pro-life advocates in their maximum hope, that Roe can be overturned, which would not proscribe abortion but would restore its pre-1973 status as a practice states can regulate. This is not a foreseeable possibility; a more nuanced abortion regime is.

Trump blasts social media double standard in tweetstorm

Texto completo: President Trump wants the New York Times, CNN, and others to be held to the same standard as conservative figures who have been banned from Facebook and Twitter.
“Why is @nytimes, @washingtonpost, @CNN, @MSNBC allowed to be on Twitter & Facebook. Much of what they do is FAKE NEWS!” Trump tweeted Saturday.
Tweet
He made the comment after retweeting posts from right-of-center supporters who back his stance that conservatives are being unfairly targeted on social media.
Facebook announced earlier this week it would ban extremist figures like Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, Infowars host Alex Jones, and Milo Yiannopoulos. Both Facebook and Twitter have drawn controversy for removing or allegedly "shadow banning" — making accounts unsearchable — more mainstream conservative figures and politicians.
Trump said in an earlier post that he will continue to monitor the banning of right-wing figures like “the wonderful” Diamond and Silk duo, actor James Woods, and Paul Watson.
“This is the United States of America — and we have what’s known as FREEDOM OF SPEECH!” he blasted.
“It’s getting worse and worse for Conservatives on social media!” Trump tweeted, noting that pro-Trump bloggers Diamond and Silk have been treated “horribly” by Facebook, in particular.
“They work so hard and what has been done to them is very sad,” Trump said.
Trump also said he was surprised that both conservatives Woods and Watson were banned from Twitter and Facebook, retweeting a story published by Breitbart on how Woods had been locked out his social media accounts.
Trump retweeted Mindy Robinson, right-wing actress and host of "Red, White, and F You," who had posted a comment admonishing the fact the Woods had been banned.
“So James Woods was kicked off Twitter for quoting Ralph Waldo Emerson...but @TalbertSwan the racist fake man of God, that’s SUPPOSED to be permanently banned for hate speech is back on? What have you to say @jack @Twitter?”
Trump also retweeted Sharyl Attkisson, an investigative journalist with Full Measure News, who asked: "When did we decide, as Americans, that it's ok fo govt & 3d parties to censor/ curate our info?"

Texto completo: Open up TikTok — the wildly popular short-video app your kids spend most of their day on — and there's no telling what you'll see. 
My first tap offered up a clip of construction workers using a forklift to hoist a portajohn containing an indisposed friend. (Ha. Swipe.) Then teen TikTok star Madison Schooley (154,000 followers) practicing dance moves with two of her friends in a carpeted room. (Swipe.) Then I see a girl dancing in the street within a human-size Slinky. (Wow. Swipe.) Then a woman falling on her face after trying to push a glass door that wasn't there. (Ow. Swipe.) Then a kid creating spectral spirals by pouring paint on a spinning circular canvas. (Ooooh. Replay.) 
This is the “getting to know you" stage of my relationship with TikTok. And in the increasingly human-ish relationship we have with our apps, it's also the most important. 
Originally launched in China as Douyin, TikTok was revamped and relaunched globally in its current form by parent company ByteDance in 2016. The following year, ByteDance acquired the enormously popular lip-syncing video app Musical.ly, and one year after that, Musical.ly was absorbed into TikTok. That lip-sync legacy has stubbornly stuck around as one of the defining social milieu of TikTok — which traffics exclusively in 15-second videos.
But apart from its endless interpretations of Taylor Swift songs, a major reason TikTok has accumulated more than half a billion users worldwide since launching in 2016 is that it operates in a fundamentally different way than most of its social media competitors.
Like Facebook (at first) and Snapchat, it's a network built on a mix of content from inside and outside of one's social circles. But while what we might now call “traditional" social media centered your social life and treated the world outside of it as something to be invited in, TikTok — from the moment you tap the app — pushes you out into the world and attempts to guess where you'd want to go. 
Those first five videos I watched (or skipped) were just the starting point for a long, AI-assisted learning process whereby TikTok gradually assembles and caters to an idea of who and what I like to watch. And my next 100 swipes bore this out: When I lingered on a video I saw more like it. When I replayed a video for whatever song it contained, that song reappeared later in the queue. It's likely that TikTok's machine learning tracks every aspect of videos you watch — from the filters they're run through to the stickers and songs that festoon them. 
While it's easy enough to create videos on TikTok, it's this mutual exchange of consumption and refining of preference that feels like its raison d'etre. (Though documenting poorly executed choreography seems to run a close second.)
Of course, you barely notice this push-and-pull after 10 or so videos. Or 100. Or 1,000. Once it “gets" you, the TikTok experience becomes a friction-free glide into the curated unknown. 
And TikTok seems aware of the bottomless hole of content it has coaxed millions of users into, even offering a screen time management setting in its “Digital Wellbeing" menu to nudge you off the app. If keeping up with friends on Facebook ever felt like a mild addiction, TikTok is hoping you'll be even more interested in strangers. 
“Imagine a version of Facebook that was able to fill your feed before you'd friended a single person," wrote John Hermann in his primer for The New York Times, “That's TikTok."
All of which adds up to a promising solution to the gripes of many disaffected Facebook users, who loathe the daily slog through its endless stream of ads, articles, arguments, and aggrandizement. It also means a major problem for parents already wary of letting their kids onto digital playgrounds. 
In India, the app is just coming off a weeklong ban imposed by the government on grounds that the app was "encouraging pornography," spreading sexual predation, and generally endangering children. (It was also having to actively combat the spread of fake news across the platform in advance of India's elections.)
And here in the US TikTok agreed back in February to pay $5.7 million in fines to the FTC to settle allegations that it illegally collected information from users under 13 by failing to require parental consent and not complying with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).  
Since then, there's been a far more visible push on TikTok to empower users to control content and boost safety.
Shortly after the FTC settlement, it introduced “a limited, separate app experience" for children “that introduces additional safety and privacy protections designed specifically for this audience," “does not permit the sharing of personal information," and “puts extensive limitations on content and user interaction." Two months later it forged a public partnership with Internet Matters, a “not-for-profit organization whose purpose is to empower parents and carers to keep young people safe in the digital world"
These are important measures, but even as TikTok learns how best to police a userbase that signed up for a free-for-all, it's important to recognize it as part of a larger turn in social media.
With Facebook launching its own TikTok clone (Lasso), and erstwhile Vine founder Dom Hoffman actively teasing his forthcoming short-video app Byte, we'll be seeing a lot more of these high-exposure platforms; and by necessity, they'll be seeing a lot more of us.

Barr corrupted debate on Mueller report

Texto completo: One of our most colorful legal concepts is the "fruit of the poisonous tree. The phrase was introduced by Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter 80 years ago to hold that evidence obtained illegally cannot be used to convict a defendant.
We now know that the entire debate the country has been having over special counsel Robert Mueller's report was fatally infected by the lethal sapling that was Attorney General William Barr's four-page letter offering his gloss on the findings of the 448-page document. As a dandruff shampoo ad taught us long ago, you never get a second chance to make a first impression.
It's not good enough that a redacted version of the report was eventually made public. For 27 days, the debate over Mueller's findings was twisted by Barr's poisonous distortions that implied a full exoneration of President Trump. Many public statements and much punditry were devoted to insisting that Trump's opponents owed the president an apology, that the Russia matter was never what it was cracked up to be, that the president was free and clear.
While it would be nice to see an outpouring of public apologies from those who were snookered by Barr, I am not anticipating a run on sackcloth. But it is very heartening - but also, in light of Barr's subsequent conduct, very disturbing - to know that one person who was infuriated by what Barr did was Mueller himself.
As The Washington Post and then The New York Times reported, three days after the attorney general released his propaganda document, Mueller wrote Barr to express his dismay. "The summary letter the Department sent to Congress and released to the public late in the afternoon of March 24 did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance of this office's work and conclusions, Mueller wrote, adding, "There is now public confusion about critical aspects of the results of our investigation.
Yes, and confusion was what Barr had in mind. The longer Mueller's findings were misrepresented, the more time Trump had to claim vindication, to denounce the media and - well, to lie and to disfigure the results of inquiry that were in fact devastating about his conduct. Mueller's office did not take this calmly. It intervened the day after Barr issued his non-summary summary, and again with Mueller's letter.
Recovering from Barr's original sin is well-nigh impossible. Of course we now know what the report said. Congress can investigate, and the House can even impeach. But the political context for such decisions is irreparably warped. It will take enormous work to overcome that first impression that Barr so deviously created.
And anyone who still hopes that Republicans might have qualms about this massive coverup was not watching Wednesday's Senate Judiciary Committee hearing where Barr testified. We have a president who was plainly elected with Russian help, and Republican senators want to go after FBI agents whose only transgression was to be worried about the intervention of a hostile power in our politics. They also want to reinvestigate - Hillary Clinton! Most Republicans have locked away their consciences to appease a mob screaming, "Lock her up!
When he answered questions from Democrats, Barr did everything he could to justify the resignation calls from Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen and other Democrats. To trust Barr as anything but a specialist in smokescreens is now impossible.
It was Van Hollen who - two weeks after Mueller had registered his complaint - had asked Barr an un-senatorially direct question: "Did Bob Mueller support your conclusion?
Barr replied: "I don't know whether Bob Mueller supported my conclusion.
Lawyers might argue over whether this was an outright lie, but to call Barr's answer misleading and obfuscatory is rather kind. Trump must have been very proud of his attorney general.
The obfuscation and indirection continued Wednesday when Democrats tried to pin Barr down on his prevarication.
When Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., pressed Barr about a misleading statement he made in response to an April 9 query similar to Van Hollen's from Rep. Charlie Crist, D-Fla., Barr's answer was so convoluted that Whitehouse finally threw up his hands and earned a nomination for the quotation of the day: "I can't even follow that down the road. I mean, boy, that's a masterful hairsplitting.
The corruption Trump has fostered now goes to the top of the Justice Department. We have an attorney general who has proudly and shamelessly corrupted our political conversation to protect a president whose survival depends upon burying facts and clouding public understanding.

Oh Lord! Another Trump Day of Prayer.

Texto completo: Donald Trump, the president of the United States, hosted his third National Day of Prayer on Thursday.
Let's give that sentence a moment of silent reflection before we move on.
. . .
Okay. The setting was the Rose Garden, though no roses were yet in bloom. It was just before noon on the 833rd day of the Trump presidency, with 551 days until the next presidential election - a fine occasion to consider the president, the country and the moods of each. The body politic is "in a high state of agitation," to quote the attorney general's recent testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, while the president has never been "happier or more content," as he tweeted on Easter.
On Thursday it was spring in the shade, summer in the sun and heaven in the Rose Garden. The economy was good. The president was adored. And the people?
"They're using the word 'God' again," Trump said from the rostrum, as if "God" had not been uttered in many years.
The president himself was serene, at least for a man who believes himself to be enduring both a coup and a witch hunt. His hair was radiant. Accompanied by the chirping of birds, Trump said hello to his secretaries of agriculture and housing. He spotted the flaming mane of the country singer Wynonna Judd, seated behind Ivanka.
"Well I'm looking at that beautiful red - would you please stand up? What a -"
He grasped for a word.
"What a - "
Only God knows which ones he considered.
" - what a voice. You're so great."
Judd motioned to the dais and said something inaudible.
"You better," the president said playfully. "You better come up here."
Judd did not go up there. Seated across the grassy aisle, behind Melania Trump, was Jonathan Cain of the rock band Journey. He was there to sing with a small gospel choir about how God's breath is in our lungs.
"When I first started campaigning," the president was saying, "people were not allowed - or in some cases foolishly ashamed - to be using on stores 'Merry Christmas.' . . . They'd have red walls, and you'd never see 'Christmas.' That was four years ago. Take a look at your stores nowadays. It's all 'Merry Christmas' again."
The president eats people's souls, the former FBI director, James B. Comey, had written in the New York Times hours before.
"It is hard to look at this president's actions," said Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg last month, "and believe that they are the actions of somebody who believes in God."
Does Donald Trump believe in God? Should that matter?
He certainly believes in himself. He believes in the economy. Golf is like a religion, though it accommodates cheats. Twitter seems like a kind of prayer, for Donald Trump. Repeat "WITCH HUNT" like a decade of the rosary, and eventually it starts to echo around your brain like a belief. You start to believe. Everyone starts to believe. America prays more than any other wealthy country, according to the Pew Research Center. We are a nation of believers.
Mike Pence is a believer. ("They do believe - I'm with 'em a lot ," Trump said of the Pences on last year's Day of Prayer, a twinge of exasperated affection in his voice. "They do believe.") Mike Pence believes in Donald Trump. The vice president looks at Trump with that mask of ecstatic supplication etched onto faces in medieval iconography. From the microphone Pence insinuated that religious freedom - established in 1791 by the First Amendment to the Constitution - had finally, finally been fully realized by the Trump administration.
"We believe we always do well to go to the Lord in prayer," Pence said. "But it seems especially important these days." He and Trump grieved the burning of three black churches in Louisiana, the attack on New Zealand mosques, the massacres at synagogues attacked in Pittsburgh and Poway, Calif. Trump invited Rabbi Yisroel Goldstein, whose fingers were blown off in the Poway shooting, to talk about finding light in darkness.
"Mr. President, when you called me I was at home, weeping," said the rabbi, hands wrapped in royal blue casts. "You were the first person who began my healing. You heal people in their worst of times."
"That's so beautiful," Trump said.
Meanwhile the White House announced a new rule that would allow health-care workers to refuse to perform services that violate their religious beliefs.
("This is the Trump administration's most dangerous attempt yet to weaponize religious freedom," said Rachel Laser, president and CEO of Americans United for Separation of Church and State.)
The teleprompter eventually nudged the president toward the Bible, and Trump talked about what God promises - how those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength and not grow weary. The president saw himself in this message.
"People say, 'How do you get through that whole stuff?' " Trump said. " 'How do you go through those witch hunts, and everything else?' And you know what we do, Mike? We just do it."
He looked at the vice president, who might've been praying for the president to bring his digression full circle.
"And we think about God," Trump added. "That's true."
The president invited religious leaders to the microphone. One by one they spoke about the need for civility, about repenting for self-aggrandizement, about extending the hand to the vulnerable and disadvantaged. (This week, Trump announced that he wants to charge asylum seekers a fee to apply for refuge).
Then Trump said goodbye. A quartet of Marines began a concerto for strings as the crowd broke up. From the back of the Rose Garden, behind a rope, came a kind of prayer. It was lost in the noise.
"Mr. President," beseeched Kelly O'Donnell of NBC News, "do you want to comment about the attorney general?"

Texto completo: When Ted Bundy died in the electric chair 30 years ago in Florida, a witness to the execution - a prosecutor in the case of a 12-year-old girl Bundy murdered - told the New York Times: "He probably could have done anything he set his mind to do, but something happened to him and we still don't know what it was.
Three decades later, we still don't, and the aptly named "Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil, and Vile doesn't provide any new answers.
Instead, Joe Berlinger's film, starring an impressively scary Zac Efron, tries with mixed success to address a different issue, namely how Bundy not only used his good looks and boyish demeanor to fool those closest to him, especially his longtime girlfriend, but how he managed to seduce some in the media and public - to the point where, revoltingly, he had actual groupies at his murder trial.
Berlinger's film, based on Liz Kloepfer's memoir "The Phantom Prince: My Life with Ted Bundy, happens to have coincided this year with his own docuseries on Bundy, also on Netflix. It's clear that the feature film benefits from a documentarian's eye; in fact it's the frequent snippets of real-life footage that give the movie some of its most interesting moments, and make for a chilling credits sequence in which we see Bundy in real-life scenes that we've just watched Efron perform.

Texto completo: James Holzhauer reached another "Jeopardy!" milestone with his 20th victory on the quiz show Wednesday.
The triumph moves Holzhauer, a 34-year-old professional sports gambler from Las Vegas, into a second-place tie with Julia Collins for the most consecutive wins, although he remains substantially behind all-time champ Ken Jennings, who won 74 times. (Champions were limited to five appearances until 2003).
Even more impressive, Holzhauer racked up another big money win, $101,682 on Wednesday, bringing his total to $1,528,012, inching closer to Jennings' $2. 5 million haul in just over a quarter the number of appearances.
Timanus notes Holzhauer's mastery of the signaling buzzer, but says he really stands out in his aggressive bidding.
"While many players, myself included, prefer to play categories from top to bottom and try to stick to them, Holzhauer clears the big-dollar clues first," Timanus says. "Thanks to his ability to ring in first consistently and rarely miss, he usually has a considerable total built up by the time he uncovers a Daily Double. He finds most of them since he’s able to maintain control of the board for long stretches, and, as we've seen, he's not afraid to bet big. "
His overall assessment of Holzhauer the player: "Speed, instinct, confidence and knowledge — pretty SICK, wouldn’t you say?"

Texto completo: KABUL, Afghanistan -- The American military command in Afghanistan has halted regular assessments of how many people and districts the government and insurgents there control, it emerged on Wednesday -- eliminating what has long been an important public measure of progress in the war.
The military said the assessments had "limited decision-making value" for commanders. As recently as November 2017, the previous American commander in Afghanistan had called them "the metric that's most telling in a counterinsurgency."
The decision to end the assessments, which have been produced in various forms since at least 2010, was published in the latest quarterly report by the American special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction.
"We're troubled by it," the inspector general, John F. Sopko, said in an interview. "It's like turning off the scoreboard at a football game and saying scoring a touchdown or field goal isn't important."
The military command in Afghanistan told the inspector general that the assessments, which had covered each of the country's 407 districts, were "subjective" and were plagued by "uncertainty in the models" that produced them, the report said.
"We are focused on setting the conditions for a political settlement to safeguard our national interests," Col. Dave Butler, a spokesman for the American-led military mission in Afghanistan, said in a statement to The New York Times. The assessments "did little to serve our mission of protecting our citizens and allies," he said.
Colonel Butler added that the information in the assessments was already provided to Mr. Sopko by intelligence agencies.
Mr. Sopko said that while United States and Afghan forces, along with the Taliban, knew what was happening on the ground in Afghanistan, ending the assessments cut off vital public information. He said he and many members of Congress had access to classified information unavailable to the public.
"The only people who don't know what's going on and how good or bad a job we're doing are the people paying for it -- the American taxpayers," he said.
Bill Roggio, a military commentator whose assessments have challenged the Pentagon's analyses, said the assessment reports had recently reflected a shrinking in the territory the government controlled, particularly outside urban areas.
"The district assessments highlight failure, which is contrary to the U.S. military's desired message of success," Mr. Roggio said in an email. "Make no mistake, if these assessments showed the Afghan military retaking lost ground, the U.S. military would continue to publish the information."
Mr. Sopko's report said the assessments had limitations but were "the only unclassified metric" provided by the military "that consistently tracked changes to the security situation on the ground."
Ending the public assessments is the latest move by the military command in Afghanistan to limit public dissemination of information about the war, which is now in its 18th year. In October 2017, the military stopped reporting casualty figures for Afghan security forces at a time when casualties were approaching what the Pentagon now considers unsustainable levels.
Also classified or restricted are performance assessments for Afghan security forces and information about the operational readiness of Afghan Army and police equipment; anticorruption efforts by the Afghan Ministry of the Interior; and progress by the Afghan military on certain security-performance benchmarks.
Anthony H. Cordesman, a national security analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said ending the assessments "means there now is no official estimate of progress in the war since late 2018."
But he added in an email, "There is no reliable way to know who is 'winning' or the level of 'stalemate."' That included the assessments, which he said had often seemed too positive.
Gen. John W. Nicholson, Jr., the American commander in Afghanistan until September last year, told reporters in November 2017 that district and population data were "the key factor that we're looking at." He said that he hoped the Afghan government could extend its control to 80 percent of the population by the end of 2019.
The most recent American military assessment, released in January for the three-month quarter ending in October, showed that the government in Afghanistan controlled territory containing 63.5 percent of the country's population. That represented a 1.7 percent decrease from the previous quarter.
The report said gains by the Taliban had given the insurgents control over territory that was home to 10.8 percent of the population. The remaining population areas were considered contested.
The Pentagon said at the time that the assessment was "not indicative of effectiveness" of American military strategy, citing "uncertainty" and "subjectivity" in the data. Mr. Sopko said that had been the first time the military had criticized its own metric.
An analysis co-authored by Mr. Roggio, a senior fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, published in the Long War Journal, found that territory controlled by the Afghan government covered 48 percent of the population and that held by the Taliban 9 percent, with the rest contested.
The inspector general's report said Afghan defense force casualties rose by 31 percent from December through February compared with the same period a year ago. Insurgent attacks increased by 19 percent from November through January compared with the quarter ending in October, the report said.
The figures reflect a higher tempo of combat operations in the conflict as both sides seek leverage in the peace talks between the United States and the Taliban in Doha, Qatar. The Taliban announced their spring offensive on April 12.
The report said that the Afghan army and national police force were below authorized strength levels. The army was 36,000 personnel below its authorized level of 227,000, and the police force 6,600 below its authorized level of 125,000.
Both forces have been plagued by corruption, poor leadership, desertions and "ghost soldiers" -- the practice by some commanders of producing inflated strength numbers and pocketing the extra salaries.
In the United States, training classes for Afghan pilots were shut down by the Pentagon after more than 40 percent of the student pilots went absent without leave, the report said. Mr. Sopko said Afghan military trainees have higher A.W.O.L. rates than those from any other country.
The report warned that even if a peace agreement were reached, the American military and reconstruction effort in Afghanistan would continue to confront longstanding obstacles. It listed eight areas of concern, among them widespread insecurity, endemic corruption, threats to advances in women's rights and rampant drug trafficking.
The report said the United States had spent $ 9 billion since 2002 to combat opium production and trafficking, a trade that helps fund the Taliban. Yet Afghanistan remains the world leader in poppy cultivation -- reaching a record in 2017, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.
The United States has spent $ 780 billion in Afghanistan since 2001, with $ 133 billion of that amount earmarked for reconstruction, the report said.
American and Taliban negotiators have reached an agreement on the framework of a deal for the withdrawal of American troops in exchange for a Taliban guarantee that terrorists would not launch attacks from Afghan soil. But widespread combat and insurgent attacks against civilians have continued.
"The risks don't automatically go away just because you sign a peace agreement," Mr. Sopko said. "All we are saying to Congress and the administration is: Plan ahead."

Texto completo: [Want to get this by email? Here's the sign-up .]
The "Daily" theme music has become inseparable from the show -- a dramatic combination of piano, viola, drums and guitar. So why are we always tinkering with it?
That's the question we're asked anytime we move or modify the opening soundtrack, as we did on Tuesday, in an episode about the safety culture at Boeing.
That day's show began with a cold open: a raspy-voiced inspector at Boeing, nicknamed Swampy, recalling his journey from pride to embarrassment over his employer's conduct. The theme music was entirely absent for the first minute, as Swampy spoke with a Times reporter, Natalie Kitroeff. Then, at around minute 1:08, music creeps up, but it's not our normal theme. It's close, but sparer -- the "Daily" theme on a diet. One listener wrote in wondering if her headphones were broken. Nope.
In musical parlance, these are the stems, the individual components of our normal theme music, recombined.
Here's how the producer who made the episode, Clare Toeniskoetter, explained her approach to changing up the theme song: "Choosing music is so instinctual, it can be hard to put in words -- but I didn't want to overpower the story we had already started with Swampy. I took out the lead guitar, strings and synthesizer to create a simpler version of the theme."
"The power of the story is in Swampy's words, not in the music," she added. "When we go into the theme music, I want it to feel like he's still there with us."
From the start, we've occasionally rearranged our theme music to signal that an episode will break the mold. When we made a special episode for children in 2017, about two sisters wrestling with whether to stay in the Girl Scouts or join the Boy Scouts, our technical manager, Brad Fisher, created a new version of our theme music using a toy piano. For our annual Year in Sound (here are the 2017 and 2018 episodes), Clare used another variation, a severely shortened theme that ends with a foreboding drone. Producer Andy Mills employed a similar technique in an episode about President Trump's taxes, which began with three investigative reporters in a locked room full of confidential documents. It's not until the two-minute mark that the theme music begins, then quickly trails off. In her first dispatch from the U.S.-Mexico border, Annie Brown waited longer still -- a record-breaking six minutes into the episode -- to introduce a haunting, subtle version that she had created.
On the vast majority of days, our theme music will be the same, unchanged melody. But you've now been warned: We'll keep tinkering with it from time to time.
P.S. If you haven't heard this parody of our theme music, created by composer Bobby Lord, listen here.

Behind the music
For a bit of history behind our theme song, by Jim Brunberg and Ben Landsverk of Wonderly, listen to this bonus episode of "Song Exploder." Our first choice for the theme was actually a sort of "punk Russian rock 'n' roll song," as Jim and Ben described it -- it sounded like something that could be played at a circus. But through rounds of experimentation (and lots of long conference calls), the tune kept evolving into what you now hear every morning, ending with a set of ascending notes that, as Ben explained, are supposed to sound like an unanswered question.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- It was emailed to 388 administration officials every night as an attachment: a copy of President Trump's private daily schedule, outlining his upcoming meetings and their locations, helping the White House staff plan around his day.
But since that schedule -- which revealed that Mr. Trump's day was often made up of large blocks of unstructured and unscheduled "executive time" -- began regularly turning up in the hands of journalists, the White House has instituted a new system to crack down on unsanctioned "leaks."
There are no more email attachments, according to two officials. Instead, the president's daily private schedule is now shared on SharePoint, a Microsoft product that allows an administrator to monitor who has viewed the document. Based on how often people view the schedule, and when its contents become public, the White House has narrowed down its search for the schedule "leaker" to three potential culprits, a person familiar with the matter said.
Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said in an email that "we don't comment on internal processes regarding the President's schedule."
But since the beginning of his presidency, Mr. Trump has been preoccupied with "leakers" he is convinced are embedded in the government and are part of the "deep state," working either in intelligence agencies or on his own White House staff.
"Leakers are traitors and cowards, and we will find out who they are!" Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter last May.
Since the release of the special counsel's report, Mr. Trump has become fixated on a new group he considers disloyal: the former administration officials who took notes while working in the White House and shared them with investigators.
"Watch out for people that take so-called 'notes,' when the notes never existed until needed," Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter.
Playing on his paranoia, White House officials have often tried to diminish each other in the president's eyes by accusing each other, in front of him, of being "the biggest leaker" in the West Wing.
The president's rage at leaks reached an angry pitch when in September The New York Times published an anonymous op-ed article written by a senior administration official titled, "I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration." Mr. Trump, on Twitter, responded by questioning whether the act of writing the piece constituted an act of "TREASON."
But the schedule has been its own, specific headache. Its bare-bones contents never revealed much about the internal workings of the White House, where meetings most often happen on the fly as Mr. Trump calls officials in to chat with him in the Oval Office or in his private dining room.
Meetings that were scheduled were usually outlined in general terms, like a "meeting with the chief of staff" in the Oval Office; a 30-minute "intelligence briefing" with John R. Bolton, the national security adviser; or a 45-minute "border meeting" with Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and senior adviser.
Certain events were purposefully left out -- meetings with the president's lawyers, as well as personal meetings with his children or friends like Sean Hannity, the Fox News host, who might come to the White House for a visit, according to a former official.
But most of Mr. Trump's day, according to the internal schedules, has been defined by executive time, a term pulled from the private schedules that has become shorthand for the hours Mr. Trump spends watching television and responding on Twitter to the coverage. Most days, the schedule showed that Mr. Trump began his day at 8 a.m. with a three-hour block dedicated to that time.
In February, the website Axios published three months of the schedule and calculated that Mr. Trump spent 60 percent of his days in the unstructured time. White House officials pushed back on the report, writing on Twitter that the schedules did not show "the hundreds of calls and meetings" that Mr. Trump took daily. And Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, said a smaller circle of key aides received a more secret and more detailed version of the president's schedule.
Mr. Trump's allies said cracking down on the schedule leaks was important to creating a functional work environment, based on trust, in the White House. "It's a problem if you have an internal staffer working to embarrass the president," said Bryan Lanza, a former Trump campaign adviser.

Texto completo: To the Editor:
Re "Biden's 'Regret' for Hill's Pain Fails to Soothe" (front page, April 26):
In 1991, many of us were glued to our TVs as a Senate panel led by Joe Biden grilled Anita Hill as she testified during a confirmation hearing for Clarence Thomas. Mr. Biden's conduct and that of the panel were deeply disturbing and helped give us one of the most regressive justices in Supreme Court history.
It seems almost unforgivable until we recognize that if nominated, Mr. Biden will be running against President Trump.
Any candidate with a long record in public service has a record with mistakes. The question is whether he or she has grown from those mistakes or dug in deeper. There is nothing in Mr. Trump's record to suggest that his treatment of people of color, immigrants or women has evolved.
Mr. Biden is correct when he says that the character of the nation would be fundamentally altered if Mr. Trump wins a second term. In 2020, we won't cast a vote for a perfect person no matter who wins the Democratic nomination. We can, however, vote for someone who believes he or she serves the public rather than the opposite.

To the Editor:
The discussion regarding Joe Biden's handling of the Anita Hill hearings often misses the point. The catastrophic outcome was the permanent seat on the Supreme Court for Clarence Thomas. Justice Thomas has been a disaster for civil rights, voting rights, workers' rights, L.G.B.T.Q. rights, immigrant rights, patient rights, gun control, environmental protections and the ability of women to control their own bodies.
Justice Thomas is the worst outcome of Joe and the boys running the Judiciary Committee hearings back in the '90s. Anita Hill was collateral damage, along with the other female witnesses denied the opportunity to corroborate her report of Mr. Thomas's sexual harassment.
Clarence Thomas should have never been given the privilege to serve on the Supreme Court, and if Joe Biden had done his due diligence, perhaps he wouldn't be on the bench right now.

To the Editor:
It is telling that after 28 years, Joe Biden reached out to Anita Hill only when he was essentially forced to by the #MeToo movement and his desire to be president. Also telling are the exact words of the speech in March in which Mr. Biden seemed to express regret over his role in Anita Hill's testimony.
Mr. Biden didn't say he failed to give Ms. Hill the kind of hearing she deserved; he said he "couldn't" give her such a hearing, thus hinting at some sort of force he was powerless to stop.
Twenty-eight years after his brutish treatment of Anita Hill, Joe Biden still hasn't taken full responsibility for his shameful behavior.

To the Editor:
Every presidential candidate is flawed, but the attacks on Joe Biden's years in the Senate, from Anita Hill to his opposition to busing, raise an interesting question: If his Senate record was good enough for Barack Obama to select him as his vice president, why isn't that good enough for us?

Trump doesn't need to complain about bans to beat Obama on Twitter

Texto completo: The size of his Twitter following weighed heavily on President Trump's mind in the hours before his Oval Office meeting with the social media firm's co-founder and CEO.

Why, he wondered via tweet, wasn't it bigger? Although Trump ranks 13th among the world's most widely-followed Twitter users, surely he would have more than 59.9 million followers if the San Francisco-based company wasn't shadow-banning the supporters who catapulted him into the White House three years ago. After all, former President Barack Obama, several notches higher at No. 2, has 105 million.

"Very discriminatory," the president mused, noting that followers regularly disappear in large swaths. "No wonder Congress wants to get involved."

Fortunately for Trump, the perennially gridlocked legislative body doesn't have to intervene for him to capture a bigger audience. Branding consultants say he might win more followers simply by indulging in fewer tweetstorms, which can quickly suck up all the space on a smartphone screen, following more of the people who follow him, and adopting a less divisive tone.

"One key thing that stands out right away is the follow-back ratio," said Dave Kerpen, the chairman of consultant Likeable Media and the author of Likeable Social Media: How to Delight Your Customers, Create an Irresistible Brand, and Be Generally Amazing on Facebook (And Other Social Networks), a New York Times bestseller.

While Obama's following is sizable, he himself follows 614,000 people, Kerpen told the Washington Examiner .

Trump follows only 45, which is the "equivalent of people putting their hand out to take your hand and you rejecting them," Kerpen said. "He’s essentially telling people that they’re not good enough, smart enough, or interesting enough for him to bother following them back, and he doesn’t want to see what they have to say."

As for Trump's concerns about anti-conservative bias, a topic on which he hasn't tweeted since meeting with Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey on Wednesday, social media executives have staunchly denied making decisions on a partisan basis, despite grilling by Republican lawmakers.

It's true that some Twitter accounts are routinely deleted, Dorsey reportedly acknowledged to Trump, but shadow-banning isn't the reason.

Rather, in the wake of complaints that Russian agents misused platforms such as Twitter and Facebook to sway the 2016 presidential election, the company has stepped up its policing of inauthentic accounts, routinely deleting networks of bots, accounts created via software to spread messages including political positions. The purges have affected the followings of virtually all Twitter users.

One of the reasons Obama has nearly twice as many followers, which the Daily Beast reported was the source of Trump's angst, is that he was an early adopter, branding consultants say. Obama's Twitter account was created in March 2007, the month the platform made its debut at the South by Southwest music, film, and interactive media festival in Austin, Texas.

That means he benefited not only from Twitter's initial efforts to gain traction by recommending followers to its earliest users but from a history-making political campaign the next year in which he became the first black man to win the White House.

Trump, a ubiquitous presence in supermarket tabloids since at least the 1980s and a television star by the mid-2000s, didn't join Twitter until March 2009.

Still, the 59 million followers he has drawn since is "nothing to sneeze at," Kerpen said.

Many celebrities and politicians alike could reasonably be envious. Former Vice President Joe Biden, who joined the field of Democrats vying to unseat Trump in 2020, had only 3.5 million followers as of Thursday evening. Trump's 2016 rival, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, had 24 million; and Cher, the actress and singer who's been performing since the mid-1960s, had 3.6 million.

Both Kerpen and brand consultant Ali Craig said social media users win more followers by establishing a unique presence, as Trump has done.

Twitter, however, enables him to reach a much broader and more diverse audience than, for instance, Facebook or Instagram, and it's one where his tone can both repel and attract. Supporters may cheer tweets referencing "Crooked Hillary" or the strength of the nuclear arsenal Trump wields as commander in chief relative to that of North Korea, but others find it alarming.

"He's definitely not being handled, nine times out of 10, by any kind of adviser, and he says stuff that would probably be OK if you knew him and knew his personality," Craig told the Washington Examiner . "For a lot of people who don't really know the man, like most of us don't really know the man, it can be very, like, 'Wait, what?'"

While people love an occasional small shock, finding it refreshing, too much can be overpowering. Then, "people don't find it refreshing," Craig said. "They think, 'What the heck is going on? This scares me.'"

Fed nominee needs a vacation from women

Texto completo: Syndicated Columnist
Washington
Stephen Moore, one of President Trump’s many exotic picks to staff the federal government, declared this week that his opponents are “pulling a Kavanaugh against me.”
Moore, Trump’s pick for the Federal Reserve Board, is so convinced he is being treated like Brett Kavanaugh, whose Supreme Court confirmation was marred by sexual-misconduct allegations, that he reportedly hired a PR firm that helped Kavanaugh.
But there is a key difference. In Moore’s case, the enemy is … Moore — specifically, what he wrote 15 to 20 years ago for conservative outlets such as National Review.
Now CNN, The New York Times and others are reprinting Moore’s greatest hits, including his joke about how he potty-trained his son by “pasting a photo of Hillary Clinton with a bullseye target on the bottom of the potty.” And his hilarious tale about showing his children pictures of the “mangled and bloody” corpses of Saddam Hussein’s sons with the message “This is what happens to kids that grow up to be Democrats!” And the riotous bit about him “hitting on” a “gorgeous 20-something blond,” then telling his concerned son “how nice it would be if you had a much younger mommy.”
He’s in town all week, folks!
In other writings, Moore defended misbehavior on college campuses: “If (women) were so oppressed and offended by drunken, lustful frat boys, why is it that on Friday nights they showed up in droves in tight skirts to the keg parties?” He reserved particular derision for his wife. After she voted Democratic, he wrote: “Women are sooo malleable! No wonder there’s a gender gap.”
Moore is now divorced from her — and was held in contempt of court in 2013 for failing to pay more than $300,000 in child support. There’s a tax lien against his home because he owes the Internal Revenue Service $75,000.
In other words, Moore should fit in perfectly with his fellow Trump appointees.
I’m fascinated by the je ne sais quoi that mutually attracts Trump and an endless parade of oddballs. Just before Moore’s writings resurfaced, another Trump pick for the Fed, Herman Cain, withdrew from consideration after the revival of sexual harassment allegations dogging the pizza magnate.
Trump’s 2016 campaign chief is doing time in federal prison for international criminality. Former Trump fixer Michael Cohen, of Stormy Daniels and taxi-medallion fame, is headed to prison, too. Numerous aides have come to grief — Scott Pruitt, Ryan Zinke, Tom Price, Ronny Jackson — after discovering they couldn’t get away with stuff the boss does.
For important jobs, Trump has seen fit to tap the unfit — a cabana boy, a party planner, a bartender, a muffler-shop guy, a judicial nominee who didn’t know the law. Even the qualified tend to depart in disgrace: John Kelly, Gary Cohn, Jeff Sessions, Rex Tillerson, Kirstjen Nielsen. Now comes Attorney General William Barr, trashing his reputation with his dishonest unveiling of the Mueller report.
I have some sympathy for Moore and what The New York Times called his “attempts at humor.” My entire career might be so labeled. But now he’s sacrificing his integrity like many others, serving a president whose immigration policies he once called “extreme nativist,” “crazy” and “dangerous.”
Among Moore’s writings were parodies of year-end letters to friends in which he referred to himself in the third person. One shudders to imagine this year’s version:
“Steve had a rough year. First came news that he didn’t pay child support or his taxes. And for some reason, people didn’t think his jokes about mangled corpses and urinating on Hillary Clinton were funny. Wet blankets! Anyway, the really bad news came when the Senate had to confirm Steve, and — of all the rotten luck — 24 senators, including seven Republicans, turned out to be women. Ewww!
“The senators didn’t like Steve’s claim that female tennis pros ‘want equal pay for inferior work’ or him calling it an ‘obscenity’ for women to referee men’s games. (‘Is there no area in life where men can take vacation from women?’ Steve asked.) They didn’t join his cry for ‘no more women refs, no women announcers, no women beer vendors, no women anything’ — unless they ‘look like Bonnie Bernstein,’ a sportscaster who, Steve wrote, should wear halter tops.
“Now Steve is enjoying the private sector. He didn’t get the Fed job, but the publicity earned him a consolation prize: a vacation from women.”

Impeaching Donald Trump will only help him Democrats would be generating sympathy for an otherwise unsympathetic leader.

Texto completo: President Trump has called the Mueller investigation a "witch hunt" nearly 200 times on social media alone. Well, the special counsel concluded he was not a witch. After carefully scrutinizing any links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign, Robert Mueller definitively declared "the investigation did not establish that the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities." He didn't do it.
Still, several leading Democrats have called for Trump's impeachment on obstruction-of-justice charges. This is absurd.
The lesson of Watergate, we are told, is that the coverup is always worse than the crime. But in Watergate, there was a crime to cover up. We now know that Trump committed no crime. There was nothing to cover up. As Mueller put it, "unlike cases in which a subject engages in obstruction of justice to cover up a crime, the evidence we obtained did not establish that the President was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference."
This lack of an "underlying crime" is the source of Trump's justified outrage over the Mueller investigation. Imagine that you were accused of a crime you knew you did not commit, and a special counsel was appointed who spent nearly two years and over $25 million investigating you. You'd be angry and frustrated.
For months, Trump watched as the investigation dragged on, weighing down his presidency. He had to endure being accused of treason and crimes of "a size and scope probably beyond Watergate." He listened as members of the House and Senate intelligence committees, and former intelligence officials, led Americans to believe that they had seen secret evidence showing he had colluded with Russia - evidence he knew did not exist.
Of course, he wanted the investigation to end. But he didn't end it. He didn't obstruct justice because nothing was obstructed. Mueller was allowed to finish his work. The White House cooperated, sharing millions of pages of documents and giving Mueller access to dozens of senior officials. The fact that Trump railed against Mueller to aides and told White House counsel Donald McGahn to fire Mueller (which McGahn did not do, and Trump did not press the matter) is not evidence of obstruction; it is evidence of exasperation. The president has a right to vent in private to his staff.
Mueller knew about Trump's private exchanges with McGahn only because Trump put no restrictions on McGahn's cooperation. The president could have asserted privilege, but declined to do so. He let McGahn spend some 30 hours with Mueller, sharing details, according to The New York Times, "that investigators would not have learned of otherwise." This is evidence of Trump's cooperation, not obstruction.
As a result of this cooperation, the special counsel's report contains some embarrassing moments for the president. But it also proves that Trump was telling the truth when it came to the central question of the investigation: He did not conspire with Russia.
If Democrats want to pursue impeachment nonetheless, then to quote Ronald Reagan quoting Clint Eastwood: "Go ahead, make my day." Impeachment over anything other than a conspiracy with Russia will backfire with the American people and help ensure Trump's re-election. First, it will fail, because two-thirds of the Senate will not vote to convict the president. Second, Trump's supporters will see an impeachment effort as an attempted coup d'Ã©tat, energizing his base ahead of the 2020 election. And third, it will be seen as partisan and unfair by persuadable voters, who will not appreciate politicians second-guessing the conclusions of an impartial investigation. Want to push Trump's approval above 50 percent? Try to impeach him.
The Democrats' partisan response to the Mueller report makes clear that they are seeking any pretext to oust Trump. But the only thing they will succeed in doing is eliciting sympathy for an otherwise unsympathetic president.

Texto completo: When I lived in New York in the 1980s, I would sometimes take the elevators to the rooftop deck of the South Tower of the World Trade Center. Up there you could leave the noise of Manhattan behind — or soften it, anyway, into a dim formless roar.
It was, admittedly, unsettling to see small airplanes below, following flight paths up the Hudson River. But the idea that the majestic Twin Towers could be in any way vulnerable was unimaginable.
Utter disbelief is the dominant note of Mitchell Zuckoff's impressively reported and riveting “Fall and Rise: The Story of 9/11."
Zuckoff, a former member of the Boston Globe's Spotlight Team and author of “13 Hours: The Inside Account of What Really Happened in Benghazi," delivers a taut moment-by-moment account of how things unfolded so disastrously in the air and on the ground throughout that bright September day when the terrorist group Al-Qaeda hijacked four airliners and crashed them into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and a field in Pennsylvania.
Many books about 9/11 followed in the wake of the attacks. Some focused on the experiences of victims or the first-person accounts of survivors or participants in the action. Others, including Lawrence Wright's Pulitzer Prize-winning “The Looming Tower: Al-Qaeda and the Road to 9/11," probed the decades-long background to the events. Zuckoff's necessary account differs from its predecessors in taking the widest possible real-time view of the day.
Zuckoff embraces the techniques of literary journalism to piece together a cinematic chronicle — Lionsgate Television Group/3 Arts, in fact, has already purchased rights to turn it into a limited series. Terrorists, passengers, air-traffic controllers, Twin Towers workers, first responders, families, all figure into this character-driven account. Zuckoff excels at quick-sketch summaries of dozens of ordinary personal dramas about to be shattered by the attacks: an Internet analyst's anxiety about a job interview, a married couple's anticipated reunion, a New York actor's hopes of making a living without having to resort to temp jobs.
Transcripts of anguished exchanges between 911 operators and ill-fated victims trapped on the upper floors of the Twin Towers are, inevitably, harrowing reading. Zuckoff doesn't spare you, either, on accounts of the desperate souls who jumped from the towers rather than succumb to the smoke and fire closing in. In a less horrific but still dramatic turn, he relates the on-the-ground experience of residents of Shanksville, Pa., where United 93 crashed. Stunned by the events they were seeing on TV, they never expected to become part of the 9/11 story.
An inability to grasp what was happening extended beyond those trapped in the Twin Towers and Pentagon to the officials struggling to understand and manage the crisis. “The concept of more than one hijacking simultaneously and in coordination wasn't on anyone's radar, literally or figuratively," Zuckoff writes. “Years had passed since the last hijacking of a U.S. air carrier."
A deeper, if understandable, failure to anticipate stemmed from the Twin Towers' architectural design itself. Their extraordinary height — they were briefly the worlds' tallest buildings — raised concerns about the likelihood of aircraft colliding with them, as had happened at the Empire State Building in 1945 when a B-25 bomber crashed into it in the fog. The official scoop was that the towers could survive a direct hit by a Boeing 707 — but “no one calculated the risk if a plane's fuel exploded on impact." It was those fuel-stoked fires that brought the towers down.
Communications at every level were a problem. Indianapolis flight controllers trying to make contact with hijacked American Flight 77 were in “an information vacuum," Zuckoff tells us. Unaware of events in New York that millions of Americans were already seeing on TV, and unalerted to “the emerging pattern of suicide hijackings," they presumed there had been “a catastrophic electrical or mechanical failure" that had brought Flight 77 down. But the plane was still airborne — and headed toward the Pentagon. Similar confusion reigned elsewhere.
Contact between firefighters and police officers at Ground Zero was hampered. One South Tower survivor, trying to find her firefighter husband, asked a police officer for help.
“Sorry, hon," he told her, “we're on different frequencies . . . You gotta find a firetruck."
Even where signals went through, vital information — for instance, which stairwells in the burning buildings were passable — wasn't conveyed. People making their escape from the South Tower didn't think to let 911 operators know that Stairway A offered a likely way out, and the operators didn't think to ask them so as to share the information with others trying to escape.
Even more poignant was the radio contact from a small group of first responders, alive and trapped in Stairwell B in the North Tower wreckage, who were trying to locate colleagues and guide rescuers. When one of them, K-9 Officer Dave Lim, reached his wife on his cellphone, she “told him that she didn't want to hang up until either she died or he did." Eventually when the dust settled, fire department Captain Jay Jonas would spot a beam of light: “Guys . . . [t]here used to be one hundred and six floors above us and now I'm seeing sunshine."
Written 18 years after the events , “Fall and Rise" is able to take measure of the human fallout in ways that earlier books could not. (The book also serves as a gripping introduction to those in their 20s and younger, who have little, if any, direct memory of the tragedy.) Zuckoff keeps comments on the political repercussions from 9/11 to a minimum. Instead, his focus is on the empirical experience of those caught in the maelstrom. Survivors' long-term reactions, he writes, have varied widely. Some joined organizations such as September Eleventh Families for Peaceful Tomorrows, while others allied themselves with 9/11 Families for a Safe & Strong America, which endorses a “doctrine of pre-emption." By the 20th anniversary of 9/11, he notes, more people will have died of Ground Zero-related ailments than were killed in the actual attacks, according to some experts.
As “Fall and Rise" makes clear, we're not done with 9/11 yet — and may not be for decades, if ever.

Texto completo: Linda Fairstein has been rightly celebrated by many as a feminist icon. For more than 25 years, she was head of the largely male sex crimes unit of the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, where she was involved in several high-profile cases, including the "Preppy Murder" case and another I will get to in a minute. Fairstein used her pioneering legal work as the basis for 20 mystery novels featuring Manhattan sex crimes prosecutor Alexandra "Alex" Cooper. The books have been lauded for their insider view of the Manhattan D.A.'s office as well as for their deep historical knowledge of the New York sites where they're set.
Late last year, Fairstein - whose most recent book, "Blood Oath," came out in March - earned the esteem of the Mystery Writers of America, which announced that it would honor her and "Gorky Park" author Martin Cruz Smith with the lifetime achievement Grand Masters Award at a banquet to be held in New York on Thursday. The Edgars are the most prestigious honors in the mystery genre, and the Grand Master is the highest accolade. Past winners include Agatha Christie, Daphne du Maurier, Ross Macdonald, Alfred Hitchcock, Stephen King, Walter Mosley and Sue Grafton.
Two days after its initial announcement, the Mystery Writers of America said it had changed its mind: Fairstein was not to be honored.
At issue was one of the other high-profile cases in which Fairstein was involved. In 1989, she oversaw the interrogation (conducted by another prosecutor) of the Central Park Five, the five black and Latino teenagers who were wrongfully convicted and imprisoned for the rape of a 28-year-old white female jogger in Central Park. The teenagers maintained that their confessions were coerced. After DNA evidence exonerated them in 2002, all charges were vacated.
Fairstein has steadfastly defended the work of her office, and her crucial involvement in the case is a matter of public record. Fairstein appears in scenes from the 2013 Ken Burns documentary "Central Park Five." In 2018, she published an article in the New York Law Journal headlined, "In Defense of the Central Park 5 Prosecution." Presumably, this information was available to the Edgar Awards committee.
But the announcement of Fairstein's award set off a Twitter fight. Attica Locke - whose novel "Bluebird, Bluebird" won last year's Edgar for best mystery - tweeted that Fairstein was "almost single-handedly responsible for the wrongful incarceration of the Central Park Five." (Locke is also a writer for the forthcoming Netflix miniseries on the Central Park case, "When They See Us," in which Fairstein is played by Felicity Huffman, who is warding off troubles of her own.) Locke urged the Mystery Writers of America to reconsider. Fairstein responded, suggesting "a civilized conversation so I can refresh you with the facts." Another flurry of tweets concluded with Fairstein admonishing Locke, "Talk to me about the other 6 men viciously attacked in the Park that night, which these and others admit doing. You don't care about them? Good night."
The fact that Fairstein was personally involved in what many now see as a racist miscarriage of justice made members of the Mystery Writers of America very uncomfortable. (The case gained fresh notoriety in 2016 when then-presidential candidate Donald Trump insisted to CNN that the five were guilty. At the time the case was being tried, Trump took out full-page ads urging that New York reinstate the death penalty.) As more members expressed their displeasure, the organization backtracked, then issued a bland statement pledging to review its awards process. Good luck with that.
The process of evaluating contenders for an award - literary or otherwise - has never been tidy. Is the work the thing that's being judged? The life? Some mishmash of both? And, if the life is being factored into the process, must one's entire record of opinions and actions be unanimously judged to be humane and just?
Consider that in 1948, Ezra Pound - then incarcerated as a mental patient at St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington on treason charges for fascist broadcasts he made in Italy during World War II - received the Bollingen Prize in poetry for "The Pisan Cantos." The New York Times headline the next day read: "Pound, in Mental Clinic, Wins Prize for Poetry Penned in Treason Cell." Then there's the case of director Elia Kazan, who received a lifetime achievement award at the 1999 Oscars ceremony. Kazan had never apologized for "naming names" of fellow members of the Group Theatre who, like himself, had once been members of the Communist Party. Should Pound or Kazan have been honored?
Those who believe that art and literature should be judged strictly on their own terms, separate from the life and times of the human beings who created them, would say yes. Implicitly in this camp are the mid-20th-century literary critics who espoused a reliance on close readings of texts known as New Criticism and, later, deconstructionist critics like Roland Barthes, whose classic essay "The Death of the Author" pooh-poohed any attention to an author's biography as naive.
These days, the awards process seems to have become especially vexed. In November 2017, when it was revealed that multiple women had accused the husband of a Nobel board member of sexual assault, several other board members resigned, and the academy subsequently announced that there would be no literature prize in 2018; instead, two prizes are to be awarded this year. In February, the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute rescinded an award for the activist Angela Davis a few days after announcing it. At issue was Davis's support of Palestinian rights and perceived outspoken criticism of Israel. Then, the institute apologized and again offered the award. (To date, it's still not clear whether Davis will accept.)
Complicating matters is that we no longer seem to have a consensus about who "deserves" these awards - even on their own terms - so cordoning off the art from politics, or as W.B. Yeats termed it, "the dancer from the dance," is itself just another kind of argument to process. When, for example, the 2019 Pulitzer Prizes were announced earlier this month, some critics on social media pointed out that since 2000, only six women have won the Pulitzer Prize in fiction. "It doesn't help," one person wrote, that Junot Díaz is on the board. Last year, Díaz was accused by several women of sexual misconduct and verbal abuse. Lost in this conversation is not only whether the winner - Richard Powers's "The Overstory" - is worthy of the prize but whether we even have broadly acceptable language that can convey what being "worthy" on the "merits" (itself a contested word) even means.
It's impossible for award committees to evade the potential political and social conflicts that permeate every point in the process - honoring the work, honoring the life, honoring the career. But they can at least be prepared. They can thrash out any substantive issues in the recipient's record before they hit "send" on the news release. Then they should own the decision, rather than renouncing it like some hapless prisoner at a political show trial.
As for Linda Fairstein, the question is not, "Does Fairstein deserve the honor?" but, rather, "Should the Mystery Writers of America have been able to plausibly defend giving an honor to Fairstein, regardless of who protested or why?" If it couldn't, it should have known that before announcing that she had won. By withdrawing Fairstein's name after it was criticized, the organization appeared both feckless and perversely ignorant of the career of the very person it, days earlier, presented to the public as deserving of its imprimatur.
What's required is for award committees to do their work and to respect their evaluative judgments enough to stick by them for more than 48 hours. Their own award for doing so will be the self-knowledge that they honored their professed values of moral and intellectual seriousness. These days, that might be the hardest award of all to deserve.

Texto completo: WOOSTER — Probing the truth about the assassination of President John F. Kennedy is a topic that doesn’t die.
Among the people still looking and researching the discrepancies in the accepted documentation surrounding Kennedy’s death is local historian Robert “Andy” Kiel.
The facts don’t add up, according to Kiel, a former Wooster High School history teacher and past head of Tri-County International Academy who has been intrigued by the topic since high school. Kiel spoke to students in Bryan Ehrlinspiel’s IB history class at Wooster High April 9.
Additional information continues to surface, Kiel said.
As recently as Martin Luther King Jr. Day this year, a group of at least 60 U.S. citizens, including journalists, lawyers and historians, forming The Truth and Reconciliation Committee called for new investigations into the assassinations of John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X, according to The Daily Mail.
Among them are a niece and nephew of the late President Kennedy — Kathleen Kennedy Townsend and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
Perhaps it’s because, as Jacob G. Hornberger said in an article called “Understanding the JFK Assassination” and referred to by Kiel, what “began dawning on some people (was) that everything just looked a little too pat,” for example, determining a communist Marine killed the president and “then himself is suddenly killed.”
Kiel himself spoke with Jim Botelho, Oswald’s roommate in the Marines, who said that Oswald “was not a Communist or Marxist. If he was, I would have taken violent action against him, and so would many of the other Marines in the unit. I was sure that Oswald was on an intelligence mission in Russia.”
Kiel has also pointed to David Lifton’s “Best Evidence,” which presents documentation that the late President’s body was doctored between Parkland Hospital in Dallas and the autopsy site at Bethesda “for the purpose of creating erroneous conclusions about the number and direction of the shots.”
To Kiel, the answers lie with a parade of eyewitnesses, some of them virtually ignored in the Warren Report about Kennedy’s assassination.
Anyone with an interest in examining what happened can easily access their testimonies, according to Kiel, who has personally interviewed key eyewitnesses over the years on his own and as a participant in annual JFK assassination conferences in Dallas.
Kiel cited discussions with Dr. Charles Crenshaw, who treated Kennedy’s gunshot wounds, and who, because of their location, disagreed Lee Harvey Oswald was the assassin.
Crenshaw told Kiel that “the wound in JFK’s throat was an entrance wound, and the massive wound in the back of his head was an exit wound.”
Kiel pointed as well to Dr. Robert McClelland, who also questioned the Warren Commission’s conclusion that Kennedy was shot from the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository by Oswald; Bill Newman, the closest witness to the limousine; and Jean Hill, an eyewitness who stood on the opposite side of Elm Street across the street from Newman.
Hill and Newman both told Kiel that “the shots were coming from the picket fence and that the President’s car came to a stop during the shooting. The car stop is supported by over 50 witnesses, but strangely is not seen in the Zapruder film,” Kiel said.
In Bethesda, where the late President’s body was taken for an autopsy, eyewitnesses included Jim Jenkins, one of the two Navy corpsmen who served as an autopsy technician and disagreed with the official autopsy report after having seen Kennedy’s wounds; Dennis David, the late Naval corpsman who told the story of two different caskets delivered to the Bethesda Naval Hospital morgue; and Hubert Clark, a member of the military casket team who corroborated David’s account.
“I talked to (Jenkins) in detail,” Kiel said, calling him “the last living individual” who took part in the autopsy of the late President.
“The key is connecting the wounds as they looked in Dallas to what the autopsy photographs showed in Bethesda,” Kiel said.
Kiel also referenced researcher James Gouchenaur, who reported Secret Service agent Emory Moore said, “I did everything I was told; we all did everything we were told, or we’d get our heads cut off.”
“Even more shocking,” Kiel said, is that Gouchenaur said Moore told him, “Kennedy was a traitor for giving things away to the Russians (and) that it was a shame people had to die … the Secret Service had to go along with how the assassination was being investigated.”
Forensic pathologist Cyril Wecht is still another Warren Commission report dissenter, according to Kiel.
According to a 1972 New York Times article, “It was Wecht who first discovered that Kennedy’s brain, and all related data in the killing, had gone missing.
In other documentation, Wecht testified against the conclusion that a single bullet theory coincided with Kennedy’s head wounds.
“A few people were running the show; others (were) just like chess pieces,” Kiel said. “That’s how they were able to pull it off and hide it from the public for so long.”
In searching for answers, “I always go back to who benefits,” he said, naming those he believes to be the contenders — Lyndon Johnson, who became President; J.Edgar Hoover, who remained as head of the FBI until he died in 1972 after almost 50 years as director; and those who wanted escalation of the Vietnam War.
In the 56 years since Kennedy’s assassination on Nov. 22, 1963, “The truth has not been released,” said Kiel.
“President Trump had an opportunity to help in finding the truth, but he failed to deliver on his tweet from Oct. 21, 2017,” Kiel said, in which Trump said, “I will be allowing, as President, the long-blocked JFK Files to be opened.”
“Trump instead declared that he had changed his mind and that the files would not fully released until October 2021,” Kiel said, adding, “As a result, thousands of pages are still redacted or blocked in full.
“The JFK Act of 1992 put the deadline for full disclosure as October, 2017; Mr. Trump did not deliver,” Kiel said.
“It has been 56 years since JFK was killed,” he said, and “it is clear that national polls indicate that JFK was most likely killed as a result of a conspiracy, not by a sole assassin.
“I would challenge the readers of this article to dig in and research the names in this article and elsewhere (to) compare the conclusions of the Warren Commission and objectively see if they match the evidence,” Kiel said.

Texto completo: CAMDEN, N.J. - Ten days ago, the 76ers had lost Game 1 and homecourt advantage to the Nets and Brett Brown was getting criticized on Philadelphia sports-talk radio and on social media.
Folks didn't like everything from his rotations to his alleged lack of adjustments to where he puts his players on the floor in the halfcourt offense.
To make matters worse, Sixers fans repeatedly booed the team in a 111-102 defeat, managing owner Josh Harris declined to say Brown would continue as coach regardless of what happens in the postseason before Game 1 and an unflattering story in the New York Daily News came out claiming the players had tuned Brown out, among other things.
Since falling behind in the best-of-seven playoff series, Brown and the Sixers have won three straight, including both games in Brooklyn, and can advance with a Game 5 victory Tuesday night (8) at the Wells Fargo Center.
Not surprisingly, the critics have been a lot quieter, though they'll undoubtedly be back in full force should the Sixers struggle in their likely Eastern Conference semifinals matchup with Kawhi Leonard and the Raptors.
Brooklyn coach Kenny Atkinson created mismatches he was able to exploit due to the Sixers' defensive switches in Game 1, but Brown and his staff have been much more successful at avoiding those situations during the past three outings. One example is they don't switch if the result is JJ Redick having to defend one of the Nets' quick guards (D'Angelo Russell, Caris LeVert or Spencer Dinwiddie).
To me, the biggest moment in the series occurred at halftime of Game 2 on April 15.
Ahead 65-64 but having allowed 10 3-pointers, Brown lit into the Sixers in the locker room for their subpar defense. He yelled, cursed and told players, including Ben Simmons, that they needed to be better.
The Sixers outscored the Nets 51-23 in the third quarter, including 21-2 to start the period, and held Brooklyn without a 3-pointer in the quarter en route to a 145-123 victory that evened the series.
Afterward, Simmons, Jimmy Butler and Tobias Harris all said the Sixers needed Brown to read them the riot act.
In need of a win in Game 3 on Thursday to regain homecourt advantage, Brown guided the Sixers to a 131-115 victory despite not having all-star center Joel Embiid. He inserted journeyman Greg Monroe in Embiid's spot and, though Monroe only went 4 of 13 from the field and was a team-worst -9, he grabbed 13 rebounds in 24 minutes. What that told me was Brown wanted to keep using Boban Marjanovic off the bench and didn't trust rookie Jonah Bolden in a starting role.
Brown's best move in Saturday's 112-108 win was deciding to utilize a big lineup down the stretch.
With Butler having been ejected midway through the third quarter, Brown called upon Simmons (6-foot-10), Redick (6-4), Harris (6-9), eventual hero Mike Scott (6-8) and Embiid (7-2) for the final 8:19. That group limited Brooklyn to 5-for-14 shooting (35.7 percent) and forced five turnovers.
During media availability before Monday's practice, Brown said he initially wasn't sure how long he'd stick with the big lineup in the final period.
"We wanted to try it," Brown said. "I think our length and physicality interests me. It played out as it played out, but I went into it thinking that I want to see it and feel it and make a judgment after that."
Brown's judgments have been on the mark of late despite not knowing Embiid's availability until minutes before tipoff, which adds to his degree of difficulty because the Sixers have a different plan of attack with Embiid in the lineup than when without him.
He's also essentially shortened his rotation to eight - the five starters, plus Scott, Marjanovic and James Ennis - which means the starters have to play more minutes than their Nets' counterparts, but the dropoff from the Sixers' starters to the reserves tends to be significant, so it's making a difference on the court.
Maybe Brown knows what he's doing, after all.

Texto completo: Special to the Star Tribune
"Being a parent is the best," said a nurse helping my daughter deliver her baby. Then she corrected herself. "Actually, being a grandparent is the best," she said.
That sentiment suffuses "Nanaville," Anna Quindlen's book about the joys and challenges that a new generation of children is bringing to their parents' parents.
Quindlen has chronicled family life for decades, building out from her own experiences. "Nanaville" was inspired by the arrival of her first grandchild, Arthur.
Here Quindlen gives voice to the many grandparents seeking their proper place in orbit around their children's nuclear family -- to be caring and sharing, but not overbearing. For a zealous parent such as Quindlen, who quit a high-powered New York Times job to focus on raising her children, it's a challenge to stay on the right side of that line. She recalls the time she vented her frustration to a friend about some advice that her son and daughter-in-law had spurned. Her friend simply replied, "Did they ask you?" Oops. Lesson learned.
"There are really only two commandments of Nanaville," Quindlen sums up, "love the children and hold your tongue."
Much has changed since Quindlen was a front-line parent, she notes. Much is better: baby monitors, car seats, breast pumps and video chats. On the other hand, Quindlen is grateful to have done her duty before the internet began unloading a "constant barrage of judgment" on today's parents. Grandparents are different, too: more active, more likely to take their grandkids skiing "than to sit at the kitchen table and quiz them about their last report card."
Demographic changes have hit home for Quindlen, too. Neither of her daughters-in-law fits the white Catholic template that filled her family tree. Thanks to Arthur, whose mother is Chinese, Quindlen is witnessing the blending of cultures -- and the casual racism of complete strangers. For her part, she is trying to learn Chinese, an effort that gives her an appreciation of the work a child must do to talk.
Although it's a big adjustment to move from primary caregiver to secondary, being "Nana" is rich and rewarding. "I love this new stage," Quindlen says, "because it gives me a second chance, to see, to be, to understand the world, to look at it and re-imagine my place in it, to feel as though I've made a mark."
Maureen McCarthy is a former Star Tribune team leader and, most important, a grandma.

DC BUZZ: The rocky road that follows the Mueller report

Texto completo: Whether you like him or not so much, Sen. Richard Blumenthal brings an unusual perspective to bear on the Mueller report — which he was reading for the second time when I reached him by phone Friday.
As Connecticut’s former state attorney general and U.S. attorney, Blumenthal sees special counsel Robert Mueller’s work through prosecutorial lenses.
But as a political figure in the U.S. Senate and a thinly veiled loather of President Donald Trump (who never misses an opportunity to trash Blumenthal), he kind of wishes Mueller had pulled the pin before tossing the grenade.
The 400-plus pages of the Mueller report is a grab bag, something for everyone. Blumenthal and the rest of the Connecticut Dem delegation sees “an epic mosaic of criminality and impropriety,” Blumenthal’s words.
But Trump was doing a victory dance, tweeting about the “Crazy Mueller Report” and Mueller’s team chasing a “made-up fraud.”
Mueller ended up saying evidence was insufficient to charge Trump or his campaign team with conspiring and coordinating with Russian intelligence to chip away at his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. And he punted on obstruction, saying that although the report does not accuse him of a crime, “it also does not exonerate him.”
Did Mueller pull his punches? Did he blink in the end, unwilling to take down the President of the United States, no matter how flawed?
“The four corners of the law don’t always fit moral or ethical breaches,” Blumenthal said. “Whether it was criminal or not, the misconduct was unethical, immoral, unbefitting the presidency and a betrayal of Donald Trump’s oath of office.”
Attorney General William Barr said Thursday he has no problem permitting Mueller to testify before Congress. If he appears before the Senate Judiciary Committee, of which Blumenthal is a member, Blumenthal said he plans to ask Mueller whether he didn’t push further because of an internal Justice Department policy that a sitting president cannot be indicted.
Does Mueller agree with the policy? And why didn’t he push harder for an interview with Trump, instead of just submitting written questions? (Mueller in the report stated that haggling with Trump’s lawyers over an interview would have eaten up a lot more time.)
Mueller is a “by-the-book guy and probably he went as far as he thought he could go, adhering to the rules as he perceived him to be,” Blumenthal said.
With Mueller closing up shop, the action now likely shifts to New York.
Mueller listed 14 referrals on Trump-related matters to other law enforcement agencies, Most were blotted out in the report. But likely among them is fleshing out the case against Michael Cohen, Trump’s fixer who already has pleaded guilty to making payments to women who claimed affairs with Trump in order to buy their silence prior to the 2016 election.
Cohen said he was directed to do so by “Individual-1” — evidently a reference to Trump.
An then there’s a New York state investigation of Deutsche Bank — which lent Trump millions for real-estate investments when other banks were shunning him.
The door also is open for impeachment proceedings, which would start in the House.
“Nothing should be taken off table but there would have to be a lot of additional thought and fact finding and consideration of the Mueller report before any remedy is decided,” said Blumenthal.
Sympathy for Hope Hicks
After reading the Mueller report, I couldn’t help but feel just a bit of sympathy for Hope Hicks. Now just 30, she had a storybook upbringing in Greenwich, classic looks and brains to match, a modeling career followed by a PR career that landed her a job as publicist for Ivanka Trump’s clothing line in 2014.
From that, it was just a hop, skip, jump to the world of Donald Trump and his budding presidential campaign. She became “Hopie,” “The Hopester,” the one Trump trusted more than virtually anyone outside his own family. A high-level communications position in the White House beckoned after Trump surprised everyone — including himself — and won the 2016 presidential election.
But the storybook turned into something of a nightmare as the investigation of special counsel Robert Mueller proceeded. In copious detail, the Mueller report recounts how the publicly demure Hicks’ head began spinning as she read through emails telling Donald Trump Jr. that an emissary from Russia sought to provide “documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia” as part of “Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump.’’
The email exchange eventually led to the now-famous meeting at Trump Tower with Donald Jr., Paul Manafort, son-in-law Jared Kushner and a Russian lawyer thought to be the purveyor of “dirt” on Hillary. The meeting proved to be less eventful, and the lawyer segued into a discussion of U.S. legal constraints on Russia that affected the adoption of Russian children.
Hicks told the Mueller team she thought the emails were “really bad” and the media response, once they were disclosed, would be “massive.”
She went to Trump and counseled early disclosure of the emails to get ahead of the story, coupled with a friendly interview full of “softball questions.” Trump waved her off, saying it was unlikely the emails would leak - and in any case he didn’t want to know anything about it.
When Hicks subsequently told Trump the New York Times was working on a story, Trump told her not to say anything. When she mentioned the adoption discussion to Trump, the president responded: “Then just say that.”
After some back-and-forth with Donald Jr., Hicks prepared a statement saying the meeting was “primarily” about the adoption of Russian children. Donald Jr. wanted “primarily” in the statement as a hedge.
Mueller cites Trump’s three directions to Hicks not to disclose anything about the June 2016 meeting as “obstructive acts.” But ultimately Mueller concluded Trump’s actions were not obstruction because Trump never tried to hide the emails from Congress or Mueller’s team.
In any case, pretty heady stuff for Hicks, then 28. Eight months later, she was out the White House door and headed to Los Angeles for a position as communications chief for Fox. Now we know what she’s recovering from.

'No recollection' has been president's common refrain

Texto completo: President Trump has bragged that he has "one of the great memories of all time."
But - when faced with questions from special counsel Robert S. Mueller III about the 2016 campaign - Trump said his memory failed him.
When did Trump learn that his aides had met with a Russian lawyer offering dirt on rival Hillary Clinton?
"I have no recollection," Trump wrote in written responses to Mueller's team.
Did anyone tell Trump during the campaign that Russian President Vladimir Putin supported Trump's candidacy?
"I have no recollection of being told," Trump wrote back.
In at least 37 instances, Trump responded to Mueller's questions - about his campaign's contacts with Russians and about Russian interference in the 2016 election - by saying he couldn't recall.
It was an answer - or non-answer - that Trump had used repeatedly before.
He offered similarly hazy responses when he faced questions in a civil suit about Trump University, when he was pressed about his net worth in a deposition in another case, when reporters asked about his support for the Iraq War, and when he was quizzed about a key Oval Office encounter with then-FBI Director James B. Comey.
In the case of the special counsel investigation, prosecutors found Trump's repeated assertions of a faulty memory "inadequate," according to Mueller's newly released report.
Prosecutors pushed for an in-person interview.
"This is the President's opportunity to voluntarily provide us with information for us to evaluate in the context of all of the evidence we have gathered," they wrote, according to the report.
Trump declined - largely because his lawyers feared the president could misspeak or even lie, The Washington Post has previously reported.
In the end, the special counsel decided not to subpoena Trump for an interview, concerned it could lead to a drawn-out court battle, according to the report.
Trump's attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani did not respond to a request for comment Friday about Trump's memory lapses.
Defense attorneys say there's nothing unusual about a witness - especially one who's the subject of an investigation - claiming not to recall key details. If they forgot, they forgot. And if they actually didn't forget, well, how do you show that someone's lying about the contents of their own mind?
"If they say they don't recall when they actually do recall, that actually is a false statement," and could carry legal penalties, said Jacob S. Frenkel, a former federal prosecutor who now works in the D.C. office of the law firm Dickinson Wright. "The problem is, how do you prove that?"
In the past, Trump has claimed memory lapses in several cases in which he was been asked to account for his own past statements. Instead of explaining them, Trump said he didn't remember making them in the first place.
"You don't remember saying that you have one of the best memories in the world?" an attorney once asked Trump during a 2015 deposition for a lawsuit against Trump University. The plaintiffs alleged that the university - really a series of real estate seminars - misled its customers into paying thousands of dollars for little benefit.
"I don't remember that," Trump responded. He had made the claim just three weeks earlier, in an interview with NBC News.
In that Trump University deposition - when lawyers were pressing Trump about his supervision of the school, starting 10 years earlier - Trump's forgetful response set the tone. He said "I don't remember" more than 30 times, and in 16 other instances responded to questions by saying it had been "too many years."
In that case, Trump later settled the lawsuit for $25 million.
In a 2007 deposition, Trump faced an attorney who wanted him to explain a claim he had made two years earlier to reporter Timothy L. O'Brien. The claim: Trump's net worth was $6 billion.
"You don't recall telling him you were worth $6 billion?" said attorney Andrew Ceresney.
"I do not. I do not," Trump said.
The claim was important in that case because Trump sued O'Brien for defamation, alleging that O'Brien had lowballed Trump's net worth in a book.
O'Brien's defense was intent on proving that Trump was an unreliable source of facts about himself - including about Trump's net worth. As Trump was claiming to be worth $6 billion, his accountants said he was worth less.
To disprove the claim, O'Brien's attorneys first needed to show Trump made it. After Trump said he didn't recall the statement, they produced a tape of the interview.
"What are you worth right now?" O'Brien asked on the tape.
"I would say six" billion, Trump said on the tape.
Trump's lawsuit against O'Brien was later dismissed.
In another lawsuit - this one over a failed plan for a Trump-branded building in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. - Trump claimed to have little memory of his interactions with a business associate named Felix Sater, who led the project. As recently as 2010, Sater had office space inside Trump's executive suites, and a Trump Organization business card. Sater said they had met one-on-one numerous times.
But in a 2013 deposition, Trump said he'd forgotten Sater so thoroughly that, "if he were sitting in the room right now, I really wouldn't know what he looked like."
Trump has repeatedly said he does not recall an episode Mueller scrutinized as a potential act of obstruction of justice: a private Oval Office meeting he had in February 2017 with Comey.
The day before, Trump had fired national security adviser Michael Flynn after reports that he lied about his contacts with the Russian ambassador. According to Comey, the president asked to speak to him alone and then said he wanted to talk about Flynn, who was under investigation.
"I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go," Comey recalled Trump saying. Comey said he did not commit to ending the investigation of Flynn, but took Trump's statement as "a direction."
Trump told the New York Times several months later that he didn't recall having a one-on-one conversation with Comey.
"Not even that I remember. He was sitting, and I don't remember even talking to him about any of this stuff," Trump said to the Times.
The president also denied Comey's account in public, tweeting in December 2017, "I never asked Comey to stop investigating Flynn. Just more Fake News covering another Comey lie!"
But the special counsel found that "substantial evidence" corroborated Comey's account, the report said. Mueller cited as evidence a detailed memo Comey wrote of his encounter with Trump on the day it occurred and the fact that the former FBI director consistently described it under oath before Congress and in interviews with federal investigators.
Other administration officials confirmed to the special counsel that Trump shooed them out of the Oval Office to speak to Comey alone that day, the report said. And just hours before the encounter, Trump told New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) that firing Flynn would put an end to the Russia inquiries, the report said.
But in the end, Mueller was unable to ask Trump about his memory of the Comey meeting: The president's lawyers refused to allow him to answer questions from the special counsel related to possible obstruction while in office.

Texto completo: The comedian Ramy Youssef stars in a new series on Hulu. And another comic, Baron Vaughn, hosts a new Comedy Central show with the rapper Open Mike Eagle.
What's Streaming
RAMY Stream on Hulu. The comedian Ramy Youssef plays a semi-loafing version of himself in this new comedy. Set in New Jersey and centered on a Muslim family (the 20-something Ramy of the series still lives at home), the show promises freshness from the very fact that Ramy's problems are familiar. The comedy "tells the story of a young American Muslim grappling with his faith along with the usual array of 20-something pressures: romance, career aspirations, drugs, parents," Sopan Deb wrote in a recent article in The New York Times. "It's a simple formula, but after decades of Muslims being depicted onscreen as terrorists and villains or otherwise pushed to the side, it's practically revolutionary." So Youssef's character deals with some common struggles, like his family routinely chiding him for lack of ambition. "You're like the kids in Egypt," Ramy's uncle, played by Laith Nakli, says at one point. "They throw down the government, big revolution. Then what? No plan."
BOSCH Stream on Amazon. This old-school cop series deals with a new-school crisis in its latest season, as the show's titular detective (Titus Welliver) is thrust into a case involving an opioid pill mill. Based on Michael Connelly's long-running series of novels, the show has a reputation for dependably delivering both action and nostalgia, thanks to its classic procedural feel. In his review of Season 4 for The Times, Mike Hale compared the series to that paragon of Los Angeles cop shows, "Dragnet," but set in the present. "Neither the character nor the show makes apologies for being old school," Hale wrote. "'Bosch' isn't the best or most original series, but it's honest and reliable, like Bosch."
LOSERS Stream on Netflix. This sports documentary series focuses on something many would disparage: losing. The first season profiles athletes in several fields -- including boxing, figure skating, golfing and curling -- who must deal with defeats.
What's on TV
THE NEW NEGROES WITH BARON VAUGHN & OPEN MIKE EAGLE 11 p.m. on Comedy Central. The actor and comedian Baron Vaughn and the rapper Open Mike Eagle named this new comedy show after "The New Negro," the anthology that collected Harlem Renaissance-era African-American writers, including W. E. B. Du Bois, Zora Neale Hurston and Langston Hughes. Each episode showcases comics and musicians. The first episode has comedy from Chris Redd (of "Saturday Night Live"), Shalewa Sharpe, Langston Kerman and Hannibal Buress, plus music from Danny Brown.
VICE SPECIAL REPORT: THE FUTURE OF WORK 10 p.m. on HBO. This special looks at automation, and some of the industries that will potentially be most transformed in a future with more sophisticated artificial intelligence. It begins with a discussion with a group of truckers and an executive from a company researching truck automation.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — The Justice Department plans to release a lightly redacted version of special counsel Robert Mueller’s 400-page report today, offering a granular look at the ways in which President Donald Trump was suspected of obstructing justice, people familiar with the matter said.
The report — the general outlines of which the Justice Department has briefed the White House on — will reveal that Mueller decided he could not come to a conclusion on the question of obstruction because it was difficult to determine Trump’s intent and some of his actions could be interpreted innocently, these people said. But it will offer a detailed account of his alleged conduct — analyzing tweets, private threats and other episodes at the center of Mueller’s inquiry, they added.
Attorney General William Barr plans to hold an 8:30 a.m. news conference to address "process questions" and provide an "overview of the report," a senior Justice Department official said. The report will be delivered on discs to Capitol Hill between 10 a.m. and 11 a.m. (CDT), the official said, and will be posted on the special counsel’s website thereafter.
Those who spoke to The Washington Post for this report did so on the condition of anonymity, citing the matter’s supreme sensitivity.
Today’s rollout plan — and news of the White House’s advance briefing, which was first reported by ABC News and The New York Times — led to political uproar Wednesday, with Democrats suggesting the attorney general was trying to improperly color Mueller’s findings before the public could read them.
"This is wrong," Democratic Rep. Jerry Nadler of New York, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, wrote on Twitter.
While the report’s light redactions might allay some of their concerns, Democrats are likely to bristle at any material that is withheld. What the Justice Department and Trump’s lawyers might view as modest, lawmakers might see as overly aggressive.
Barr also is likely to face scrutiny over the Justice Department’s talks with the White House — which could help Trump and his attorneys hone their attacks on the report in advance.
Rudolph Giuliani, one of Trump’s lawyers, has said he is preparing a counterreport to Mueller’s findings, and in a recent interview said his document would explain from the president’s viewpoint every episode that could be considered obstructive. Giuliani and others have long feared Mueller’s findings on obstruction, viewing them as potentially more damaging than anything Mueller found on the Trump campaign’s contacts with Russians.
Mueller did not find a conspiracy between Russians and Trump or his campaign, Barr said in a brief letter of the special counsel’s conclusions shared with Congress late last month.
Jay Sekulow, one of Trump’s attorneys, told The Washington Post, "We do not discuss conversations that we may or may not have had with the president." A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to address questions about its briefings to the White House, the report’s redactions or Mueller’s findings on obstruction.
Trump had also apparently been briefed in advance of the planned news conference, which he revealed Wednesday during a radio appearance, which was confirmed later by a Justice Department spokeswoman. Barr will appear alongside Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the spokeswoman said, and he planned to take questions.
Barr has faced intense scrutiny from the public and lawmakers on Capitol Hill for his handling of Mueller’s report. Today’s news conference could give him an opportunity to address his critics — and perhaps provide them fresh ammunition. It is sure to be watched closely by Trump, an avid TV viewer whose relationship with his attorney general will almost certainly be colored by Mueller’s findings and what Barr says about them.
Kerri Kupec, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said the White House did not ask the Justice Department to hold the news conference, but she declined to discuss White House and Justice Department interactions about the report.
Trump told the Larry O’Connor show on WMAL that he was pondering having his own news conference.
"You’ll see a lot of very strong things come out tomorrow. Attorney General Barr is going to be giving a news conference. Maybe I’ll do one after that; we’ll see," Trump said.
Already, Democratic lawmakers and pundits have alleged that Barr seems to be taking steps to mitigate the political damage Mueller’s report might do to Trump, and some members of Mueller’s team have told associates they are frustrated by the limited information he has released about their work.
A senior White House official said Trump has praised Barr privately for his handling of the report and compared him favorably with former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who Trump grew to loathe over his recusal from what would become Mueller’s investigation.
Since the special counsel’s office closed its investigation late last month, Barr and his team at the Justice Department have been reviewing the final report to determine how much of it can be made public. The Justice Department has said it plans to release the document with four categories of information shielded from public view: material from the grand jury, material that reveals intelligence sources and methods, material that is relevant to ongoing investigations, and material that could affect the privacy of "peripheral" third parties. Each redaction will be color-coded so readers know the reason material is being shielded, Barr has said.
Any redactions could be controversial, and Democrats have said they won’t be satisfied unless they are given the entire, unfiltered document. It is likely House Democrats will attempt to subpoena it, sparking a legal battle that could last for months or even years.
Barr has so far disclosed only what the Justice Department terms Mueller’s "principal conclusions." In a four-page letter to lawmakers, he declared last month that Mueller did not find that anyone on Trump’s campaign conspired with Russia to interfere in the 2016 election, and that the special counsel declined to reach a conclusion on whether Trump had sought to obstruct justice. Barr wrote that he and Rosenstein then reviewed the evidence and did not find it sufficient to make an obstruction case.
Barr offered only a few quotes from Mueller’s report, leaving a curious public with many more questions than answers about what his 22-month investigation had found.
White House officials are concerned about damaging testimony from a number of senior aides, particularly former counsel Donald McGahn and former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, according to current and former officials. Their testimony, according to people with knowledge of it, gave a clear, detailed breakdown of some of the most controversial incidents, from the firing of James Comey as FBI director to attempts to oust Sessions. McGahn spoke with the special counsel for dozens of hours, according to two people familiar with the matter.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Attorney General William Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein will hold news conference Thursday just before Congress receives a copy of special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian interference in the 2016.
The news conference will be at 9:30 a. m. EDT, said Kerri Kupec. The report is expected to go to Congress between 11 a. m. and noon EDT and likely will be released to the public around the same time.
President Donald Trump, who has claimed "total exoneration" from a summary of the report, said Wednesday he may hold a news conference as well. He is scheduled to leave for a three-day weekend in South Florida by mid-afternoon Thursday, but he may speak with reporters upon departure.
"You’ll see a lot of strong things come out tomorrow," Trump told WMAL radio's Larry O'Connor show. "Attorney General Barr is going to be doing a press conference. Maybe I’ll do one after that, we’ll see. ”

Barr said he will keep parts of the 400-page Mueller report secret.
For weeks, Democrats demanded that Barr make the full, unredacted report public while Trump seized on its major conclusions to declare “complete vindication. ”
Trump has repeatedly criticized the Mueller probe as a "hoax" and a "witch hunt. "
Mueller report: What will it say about Russia's efforts to sway the 2016 election?
Trump perils: President faces swirl of investigations even after end of Mueller probe
The long-anticipated report is the culmination of a remarkable inquiry into whether the president's aides collaborated with the Russian government's efforts to sway the election in his favor. That investigation plumbed deeply into Trump's campaign and his administration, and while prosecutors concluded that nothing they unearthed constitutes a crime, the accumulation of evidence the government is set to release could subject Trump to further scrutiny.
Mueller's investigation did not establish that Trump or members of his campaign conspired with Russia's efforts to sway the election. But investigators pointedly opted not to make a determination about whether Trump had sought to obstruct their work, saying they had gathered evidence "on both sides" of that question, according to a four-page letter Barr provided to Congress last month summarizing the report's conclusions.
Barr and Rosenstein told lawmakers that based on the evidence Mueller gathered, they did not believe Trump's conduct violated obstruction laws.
Trump promptly claimed "complete and total exoneration. " Barr's summary, however, said that while Mueller's report does not conclude there was obstruction, it also "does not exonerate" the president on that issue.
Democrats in Congress are pressing for access to a complete version of Mueller's final report, including secret grand jury testimony that is expected to stripped out of the public report. Senior lawmakers have said that Barr's decision to release only a redacted version all but assures a prolonged fight in Congress over the investigation's most sensitive contents, including those that did not lead to criminal charges.
House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N. Y. , said Wednesday that he was "deeply troubled" by a New York Times report indicating that Justice officials had briefed the White House on the contents of the report in advance of its public release.
White House and Justice officials declined to comment on The Times account.
Nadler also said he was concerned that Justice was planning to transmit the Mueller report to Congress following Barr's news conference.
"This is wrong," he said.
Barr has said Justice officials, including members of Mueller's team, have been working to remove secret grand-jury evidence, classified information, material related to ongoing investigations spun off from the special counsel's probe and personal information about individuals who were not charged as part of the inquiry.
On Wednesday, federal prosecutors told a District of Columbia judge overseeing the criminal case against former Trump adviser Roger Stone that they have removed material from the Mueller report regarding Stone so has not to interfere with the pending proceedings in which the flamboyant Republican political operative is charged with obstruction and lying to Mueller's investigators.
After the redacted Mueller report is made public, prosecutors said that they would provide a "limited" number of lawmakers with a version of the report that includes the material related to the Stone case, according to court documents file Wednesday.
Meanwhile, ahead of the report, the White House insisted that it would exonerate Trump.
“Regardless of how Democrats and the media try to twist the report, the outcome is still the same: No collusion, no obstruction - complete and total exoneration,” White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said.

Texto completo: After opening three stores in Manhattan, Book Culture looked across the East River to Queens, a borough where you can count the number of independent bookstores on one hand.
The 22-year-old bookstore's fourth and latest location is nestled on Jackson Avenue in Long Island City across from familiar Manhattan megaliths - Chipotle, Starbucks - and next to beloved local food businesses - Xi'an Famous Foods, Partners Coffee (formerly Toby's Estate).
Its Long Island City home has been in the spotlight as of late, from a population and construction boom to that scrapped Amazon HQ2 deal. The tech giant's controversial plan to build a campus in the neighborhood may bring to mind a certain 1990s rom-com: A corporate behemoth coming to a neighborhood concerns supporters of a small, independent business. Only in this case, of course, the giant didn't move in, and the independent business is thriving. (The movie? "You've Got Mail.")
Book Culture originally opened in 1997 under the moniker Labyrinth Books as a textbook and used bookstore for students at Columbia University. In 2007, the store, located in Morningside Heights on West 112th near Broadway, rebranded to Book Culture and became more of a general interest bookshop; today it sells everything from New York Times best-sellers to Ruth Bader Ginsburg tote bags and S'well water bottles.
Since its rebranding, the bookstore has added Manhattan outposts at addresses that once housed booksellers, in Morningside Heights at Broadway and West 114th Street and on the Upper West Side on Columbus Avenue near West 82nd Street.
The Long Island City location opened in December 2017, where it has quickly gained a following as a place to shop for contemporary literature, children's books and gifts. It also is among a small but growing number of Queens independent bookstores.
"Book Culture has always been committed to keeping the legacy of bookstores alive," says Althea Lamel, general manager at Book Culture LIC. "Barnes & Noble [in Bayside] closed, [but] a lot of independent bookstores, like Astoria Bookshop and Kew & Willow, have opened in Queens."
Book Culture LIC offers similar goods as the other Book Culture shops, though the different locations have their "own following," says Rachel Cartee, event coordinator at Book Culture. "The store at 112th and the Broadway store are geared toward Columbia students and academics, and the Columbus store and our store are more family-oriented."
Indeed, the LIC location stands apart with an entire lower level dedicated to children's books, games, toys and more. An open seating area allows space for families to play, read and gather for story time, singalongs, Spanish classes and more.
"Having this whole basement area is really important," Lamel says, noting that it encourages families to linger, rather than just purchase a specific item and leave.
And with the up-and-coming nature of Long Island City, a spacious, light-filled shop like Book Culture was just the space locals craved.
"High-rises are filling up, and I think [people] sensed a need for places for the community to come together," Cartee says.
FAST FACTS After Michelle Obama's "Becoming," local author and tour guide Joe DiStefano's "111 Places in Queens That You Must Not Miss" was the second top seller in 2018. Book Culture's "blind date" books, in which a mystery title (typically a book with less hype) is wrapped and promoted with comparable titles, is another popular LIC item. Each Book Culture has its own blind date table, curated by the people who work in each store. Fans can become members. For $49 a year, shoppers get 10% off all purchases, a tote bag and free shipping. All customers get $10 back after spending $200 in the bookstore's loyalty program. Book Culture LIC is located at 26-09 Jackson Ave. in Long Island City. For more info, visit bookculture.com.

How did city get a 'Brutal' library?

Texto completo: Some things, like black tuxedos, never go out of style. Some things, like light-brown tuxedos with chocolate-colored piping, do.
I have a friend who got married in the latter four decades ago. For the past 35 years, he's cringed every time he looks at his wedding pictures.
To paraphrase this week's Ask Orlando question - Why is there a 290,000-square foot light brown tuxedo with chocolate piping sitting across from Lake Eola?
The actual question - "What is the history behind the design of the Orlando Library? It seems incongruent with the rest of downtown Orlando. The label of brutalism comes to mind."
The questioner nailed it (and gets extra points for being the first Ask Orlando participant to use the word "incongruent"). The Orlando Public Library is indeed a product of Brutalism architecture.
The designs were all the rage in the 1960s and 70s. Of course, so were Nehru jackets, shag carpeting, go-go boots and disco balls.
The name nicely sums up the style - Brutal.
Unless you are third-world dictator, that's not a word most people want to be associated with. But the buildings embrace the B word. They are big, oppressive, geometric paeans to the beauty of exposed concrete.
This particular building is also a paean to incongruency. Orlando's architectural style is a warm mix of Mediterranean, modern, Spanish Colonial and Postmodern Strip Mall.
The downtown library looks like a giant totalitarian Lego set. Instead of bookworms quietly reading "The Great Gatsby", it conjures visions of a cackling Buddy Dyer in a dank room attaching electrodes to citizens who are late paying their water bills.
But architectural beauty is in the eye of the beholder, witness the construction of the leisure suit. Orlando leaders apparently had a gloriously drab vision in 1962 when voters approved plans for a new library.
The city hired John Johansen, an A-list architect from Connecticut who was at the forefront of the Brutalism movement. With Orlando's population booming, Johansen was asked to create a building that could eventually be expanded to three times its original size.
On Aug. 7, 1966, he delivered 55,000 square feet of Brutalism. According to the Orange County Library System website, Johansen called his design a "composition in monolithic concrete."
About 500 people showed up for the grand opening on a rainy afternoon. Johansen was not among them since a nationwide airline strike canceled his travel plans. He sent a telegram to the party.
"Sorry I am unable to be there. We will rejoice with you."
Apparently not everyone was in a rejoicing mood. The Sentinel noted that someone called in "an anonymous bomb scare," (as opposed to a non-anonymous bomb scare). No explosives were found, and the Orlando's grand composition in monolithic concrete was in business.
Business was good, and it wasn't long before the library needed more room. In 1978, the city council acquired the entire block bordered by Rosalind Avenue, Central Boulevard, Magnolia Avenue and Wall Street. Voters approved the sale of $22 million in bonds for construction in 1980.
But like Donna Summer, Brutalism began losing its mojo. Prince Charles even railed against the brutal buildings constructed in London.
"You have to give this much to the Luftwaffe," he said. "When it knocked down our buildings, it didn't replace them with anything more offensive than rubble."
The city hired local architect Duane Stark to design the expansion. He had to remain true to Johansen's vision, and in 1986 dignitaries cut the ribbon on 235,000 additional square feet of monolithic concrete.
As part of a 50th anniversary celebration in 2016, architecture historian Christine Madrid French gave a presentation titled "Celebrate Concrete: The Orlando Public Library and Brutalism."
"Love it or hate it, the library is one of the foremost examples of Brutalism in Florida," she said. "A fortress-like style marked by the use of rough concrete."
No doubt, many people have probably loved the library's utilitarian style. Tree growth along the sidewalks has muted some of the building's starkness.
The interior is warm and functional. As long as that's the case, patrons won't care that the building resembles KGB headquarters.
And like a Village People reunion, Brutalism is enjoying something of a renaissance.
"There's no question that Brutalism looks exceedingly cool," the New York Times said. "But its deeper appeal is moral. In the words of Reyner Banham, it was an attempt to create an architectural ethic, rather than an aesthetic."
I have no idea what that means or who Reyner Banham is. I'll simply fall back on the words of Johansen himself.
In 2008 at the ripe old age of 92, he explained to an Oklahoma newspaper how architects can't merely sit down and say they're going to produce something beautiful. That result is a happy byproduct of many components coming together.
"Some architects in the United States are searching for beauty," Johansen said. "I am not one of them."
With all due respect, we have the brutal proof sitting across from Lake Eola.

Fordham Student Dies After Fall From Campus Bell Tower

Texto completo: [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox. ]
It was forbidden. But the group of friends sneaked into Fordham University's most recognizable building in the dead of night anyway early Sunday.
They clambered up the steep staircase of the granite bell tower that overlooks Fordham's Rose Hill campus to take in the view of the Bronx under moonlight, sending a Snapchat video from the top.
Then something went horribly wrong.
One of the students, a 22-year-old senior, fell through an opening in a landing, the police said, and plummeted down the inside of the clock and bell tower just a month before her graduation.
The woman, Sydney Monfries, was rushed to St. Barnabas Hospital, where she died Sunday evening, according to the university. The police had found her unconscious inside the tower at about 3 a.m., with trauma to her head and body. The circumstances and the height of the fall were not clear.
The university sent multiple emails to students on Sunday, updating them on Ms. Monfries's fall from the tower in Keating Hall at the heart of campus and on her condition.
"There are no words sufficient to describe the loss of someone so young and full of promise -- and mere weeks from graduation," the Rev. Joseph M. McShane, the president of the Jesuit university, said in an email to students.
The tower is off limits, but that has not stopped curious students eager to get a glimpse of the view.
"It's like a senior thing to go on the most popular building on campus," said Priscilla Morales, a psychology student at the university. "Recently people heard the door was open or found a passageway. They usually go late at night at around 1 or 2 a.m. to drink and see the view."
Fordham held a Mass on Sunday night for students and faculty members to gather and pray for Ms. Monfries, who was from Portland, Ore., and had been studying journalism. The school said it would posthumously award Ms. Monfries a bachelor's degree.
"I know you join me in keeping Sydney, and her family and loved ones, in your thoughts and prayers," Father McShane said in an earlier email. "I also urge you to be kind to one another, and to yourselves, in the days that follow."
Ms. Monfries had posted a video from the top of the tower on Snapchat with the caption "Bell tower" early Sunday, according to video shared with The New York Times.
In the video, there is muffled but excited chatter as a few students stumble through the dark tower using their phones as flashlights. Other students can be seen holding up their phones to record the Bronx skyline and the university's illuminated sports field from the tower's perch.
Keating Hall is open during regular hours, but locked at night, and access to the clock tower is restricted around the clock, according to a university spokeswoman. It is unclear how the students got in.
The 83-year-old classroom and administrative building is one of Fordham's most recognizable buildings, known for its Gothic-style facade, the hourly chimes of its bells and the steps where commencement is held every year.
Many students said climbing the building's tower was a storied rite of passage that some undertake before graduating.
"There's the three things you have to do at Fordham," said Lili Huang, a 21-year-old senior studying communications.
"You have to ride the ram," she said of a statue of the university's mascot, which students climb on to take pictures. "You have to go into the tunnels underground and you have to go into the bell tower."
Others said climbing the bell tower is not a tradition, but rather a daring idea that surfaces every once in awhile, passed on through word of mouth by students and alumni.
A 2013 article in the university's student newspaper titled "Truths of a Forbidden Tower Revealed" detailed the ghost stories surrounding the tower and quoted students who claimed to have made the pitch-black climb up a spiral staircase through an interior door that is usually locked.
"The thrill of danger is definitely a huge allure to going up," one student told the newspaper, The Fordham Ram. "I would say the other two reasons for going up are the amazing view of the entire campus from up there and the ability to brag about doing it."
On Sunday, the university's campus was busier than usual, packed with prospective students visiting the university for tours. Many were unaware of the incident until university officials held a moment of silence before a welcome address.
"They said, 'Welcome, everyone, we're going to have a silent prayer for the unfortunate incident that happened this morning,"' said James Groenier, 18, of St. Louis, who is interested in Fordham's business school. "It lasted about 15 seconds and then they went on to their regular presentation."
As he spoke, a group of students passed by the back door to the building that holds the tower. A young man and his father walked up and tugged on the locked door.
Derek Norman contributed reporting.

'PRETTY IN PINK' DESIGNED TO BRING GREEN TO LATROBE ART CENTER EVENT HOPES TO BRING GREEN TO LATROBE ART CENTER

Texto completo: Love for the color pink led to a highly successful children's book series called "Pinkalicious" about a girl who loves pink -using the color in everything from cupcake icing to her choice in clothes.
On April 27, members of the Latrobe Art Center hope an event called "The Art of Fashion: Pretty in Pink" at the Latrobe Country Club will use the popularity of pink to raise plenty of green for myriad art education and community programs that the center sponsors.
One of the inspirations for the event is The New York Times best-selling book series by author and illustrator Victorian Kann. "Pinkalicious," the children's musical, is in its 11th year off-Broadway.
"We wanted to make it fun for adults and children to participate by picking the color pink. Tablecloths, clothes, desserts and even drinks will all incorporate the color,'' organizer Rosanne Bodziak said.
And, although participants don't necessarily have to wear pink, "we think a lot of people will, with their own pink-inspired styles," she said.
Doors open at the country club at 11:30 a.m. A number of local boutiques will have 40 models walking the runway New York-style, showing off clothing and accessories in all hues.
Fashions will be featured from Chicoras in Latrobe; Black Bunny Boutique, My Honey Bee and the Tree House, all in Ligonier; and Crossroads Boutique & Cattiva, Lapels, A Fine Men's Clothier and Liz Krajc Jewelry Design Studio, all in Greensburg.
Lauren Buches, executive director of the Latrobe Art Center at 819 Ligonier St., said it hosts art classes for children and adults, a gallery for local artists, a space for young people to plug in, and a popular cafe called Ricolita's, which is open for breakfast and lunch.
"We have become something of a community center,'' Ms. Buches noted.
The work of artists from throughout the region is featured in the gallery display space and those works are typically for sale.
Betty Roseborough, an artist from Upper St. Clair, has several of her paintings featured and said she appreciates the opportunity.
"It is an excellent venue for displaying your art. The art center is an uplifting, classy place. The staff and other artists create a warm, friendly atmosphere. Everyone is encouraged there," she said.
The retired Pittsburgh Allderdice High School math teacher said she found a new calling in painting. She calls it a "creative monster, but one that is good for the soul."
The artists are limited in the number of pieces they can display, and the artist's work changes every two months so exhibits stay fresh, she said.
"The social events held by the center are a reason to celebrate art," she said.
And the art of fashion will be the one celebrated at the "Pretty in Pink" event.
"We think people will enjoy looking at the fashions, and the food is good, especially the raspberry dessert, " Ms. Bodziak said.
Tickets for the show start at $50 and those who wish to attend must RSVP by April 22. Proceeds support the mission of the Latrobe Art Center.
A chicken piccata lunch, or gluten-free and vegetarian options, and dessert is included in the ticket price. A cash bar will offer pink-themed cocktails.
An interesting twist to traditional fashion shows is the addition to the runway of upcycled and tie-dyed fashions created by the Greater Latrobe Senior High School students from Courtney Coss' family and consumer science classes and Lydia Mack's art classes.
Ms. Buches likes the fact that young people are being included in the program. She said she was inspired by the permanent art gallery at Greater Latrobe Senior High School, where she attended classes, to consider art as a career.

Texto completo: Chelsea Clinton's latest book, "Don't Let Them Disappear: 12 Endangered Species Across the Globe," explores facts about 12 endangered species and teaches kids how to protect the animals and their homes.
Before her book tour stops in Phoenix on Monday, April 15, the best-selling author – not to mention daughter of former President Bill Clinton and former secretary of State Hillary Clinton – shares her thoughts via email on animals, family and the importance of reading.
Question: Why did you decide to write a book on endangered species?
Answer: All animals play a crucial part in the health of our planet, and it's devastating to think that even one species – like African elephants or rhinos – could be extinct in our or our children's lifetimes. I know that so many kids feel similarly passionate about animals and are determined to work to save animals from extinction. I've known young people, even our youngest readers, can have a positive impact in areas they're passionate about because I've seen it and been fortunate enough to share those stories in previous books. I kept hearing from kids how much they cared about animals so I decided to write "Don't Let Them Disappear" about some of the species I heard from kids they're most concerned about and what we can do to ensure they're around well beyond all our lifetimes.
Q: How did you choose which specific animals to feature?
A: There are tens of thousands of endangered animals and plants around the world and I wish I could have written a 16,000-page picture book to feature them all! All of these animals are ones that I care deeply about and I heard from kids they care about too. Some of them are species I've cared about for as long as I can remember, including elephants. As a kid, even in Little Rock, Arkansas, I wanted to do whatever I could to help save elephants and am so sad we didn't succeed in a sustainable way then.
I hope that this book helps inform and inspire kids – not only introducing them to fun new facts about the twelve species featured, but also help inspire them to take a real interest in conservation and what we all can do to help ensure these animals don't disappear.
Q: Has writing this book stood out to you in some way that differs from your previous books?
A: Each one is different and unique to me. With picture books, I always enjoy the process of working with illustrators to bring these stories to life. This was the first time I have worked with the wonderful Gianna Marino who did a beautiful job representing the 12 animals featured that are so deserving of our attention.
Q: Which animal is your favorite?
A: It was already a challenge to narrow it down to 12 – it's impossible to pick just one! But I did love learning some new facts in the process – like that giraffes can kill a lion in just one kick. And, if I really had to choose, I would say elephants.
Q: Does anyone in your life serve as inspiration to your work?
A: My kids are my biggest inspiration. And thinking about the type of world I want them to grow up in and the active and responsible citizens I hope they become drives everything I do – through my writing, teaching, and work with the Clinton Foundation. I want to ensure I've done everything possible in my small way to make the world a healthier, safer, and more equitable place for them and their generation.
Q: What's the importance of reading with your kids? Or taking them to the zoo?
A: I believe the stories we share with our children are critically important – to spark their imaginations and fuel their dreams. That includes what they read in children's books and the experiences they have in educational spaces like zoos. We also know that talking and reading with our kids has an enormous impact on their early language and literacy development – especially during the earliest years of their life. So not only are these stories and activities fostering their imaginations and passions, they are quite literally building their brains and setting them up for success later in life.
Q: Do you have any memories of reading with your parents? What was your favorite book as a child?
A: So many of my earliest and most vivid memories from childhood involve reading. From my mom reading "Goodnight Moon" to me early in life to a few years later trying to reading every female detective and mystery I could get my hands on (something I still do) — Jacqueline Winspear's "Maisie Dobbs," Alexander McCall Smith's Precious Ramotswe and Isabel Dalhousie, Rhys Bowen's Molly Murphy, and so many more I have shared with my mom and grandmother when she was alive either as recommendations or in our informal book club.
It would be impossible to pick just one from childhood or today, but I was a huge fan of "A Wrinkle in Time" — I loved sharing Meg's adventures with my parents — and I have many treasured memories of reading countless Beverly Cleary books with my mom. Reading continues to be such a big part of my life and I'm thrilled to be passing along that love to my children.
Q: Have you read the book to your kids? What's your favorite story to read to them?
A: I have! And am so thankful that they enjoyed it and love hearing their reactions. Right now Charlotte loves sharks so whale sharks are her favorite spread, and Aidan told me last week that his new favorite animal is a tiger.
Beyond this book, we read to our kids every night, and it's such a blessing to be able to see them get excited about books – that's what is important to me, ensuring that they are being read to in the way that is engaging, encourages a love of reading and fosters their curiosity about the world. We want to figure out what kind of stories and characters they resonate with by exposing them to lots of good stories. In our house we love anything by Mo Willems – we couldn't imagine bedtime without the Pigeon or Elephant and Piggie. We've also read "The Paper Bag Princess" more times than I can count!

D.C. Memo: Grin and Barr it

Texto completo: The D.C. Memo is a weekly recap of Washington political news, journalism, and opinion, delivered with an eye toward what matters for Minnesota. Sign up to get it in your inbox every Thursday.
Welcome to this week’s edition of the D.C. Memo, which — like the first few seasons of “Game of Thrones” — could be improved by the appearance of more dragons. This week in Washington: Trump blows up the Department of Homeland Security, Attorney General William Barr dares to mention the S-word, and the Minnesota delegation crowns a hotdish champion. So let’s get to it.
Three things
Purge overkill: The week started off with a bang when news broke Sunday that Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen resigned/was fired. As has become SOP under President Donald Trump , the resignation/dismissal was announced via Twitter, where Trump thanked Nielsen for her service and announced that Kevin McAleenan would become acting secretary for the department.
There were signs this was coming. Just a few days earlier, the White House had abruptly pulled the nomination of Ronald Vitiello to lead Immigration and Customs Enforcement so that the administration could go in a “tougher” direction, said Trump, a move that not only previewed Nielsen’s departure but signaled the bloodletting that was to come.
Over the next few days, in fact, the leader of the Secret Service, plus “at least two to four more high-ranking figures affiliated with Ms. Nielsen” were expected to be pushed out, “hollowing out the top echelon of the department managing border security, presidential safety, counterterrorism, natural disasters, customs and other matters,” reported The New York Times. “The wave of departures of officials originally appointed by Mr. Trump underscored his growing frustration with his own administration’s handling of immigration and other security issues. In recent days, Mr. Trump has threatened to close the southwestern border altogether only to back off and give Mexico a one-year notice in the face of warnings about deep economic damage from such a move.”
Those moves didn’t go over well with one set of Trump frenemies: Senate Republicans. Several, including Wisconsin’s Ron Johnson and Iowa’s Chuck Grassley , urged Trump not to fire any more DHS officials for fear of debilitating the department, wrote the Washington Post. “Republican senators remain concerned that Trump’s anger will lead to a continuing purge of DHS officials with no clear replacements,” the paper reported.
Meanwhile — despite her departure/escape from the Trump administration — things weren’t going so hot for Nielsen, either. Though she had reportedly tried to slow-walk the administration’s family-separation policy when it was first proposed, she eventually became the face of it (despite claiming such a thing didn’t exist, then standing beside Trump when he signed an executive order rescinding the policy, even though it didn’t exist).
Anyway, seems some people can’t let bygones be bygones when you go to bat for breaking up families and putting kids in cages, or sorry, “pens.”
As the Post explained:
Now, as the former homeland security secretary exits the Trump administration, a coalition of liberal groups is seeking to prevent her from going on to the type of lucrative private-sector job or speaking gig that many former Cabinet officials take upon leaving public service. …
Even before her forced resignation, liberal groups, immigrant rights advocates and others had launched an effort to pressure companies not to hire Nielsen and more than two-dozen other Trump administration officials who were involved in implementing and defending the family separation policy.
The campaign, led by Restore Public Trust, included a letter last week to Fortune 500 company CEOs as well as an ad in the New York Times with the message, “Attention corporate America: Don’t let hate into your boardroom.”
Barr examined : In the wake of issuing his controversial reading of the Mueller report, Attorney General William Barr appeared before Congress for two days, during which he dropped a couple of substantial nuggets.
The first was that he planned to release the Mueller report “within a week,” though that announcement came with the caveat that it would be a redacted version of the document, something that didn’t sit well with Democrats, naturally (though Barr also said he would work with congressional leaders so that members could read some parts of the redacted report.)
Democrats also railed against Barr’s four-page summary of Robert Mueller’s report, arguing that it didn’t fully capture the nature or seriousness of the evidence gathered by Mueller’s team, which Barr disputed. “Barr insisted that he had accurately delivered the ‘bottom line’ conclusions from Mr. Mueller’s inquiry into Russia’s election interference and whether any Trump associates conspired, as well as whether President Trump tried to impede the inquiry,” wrote the Times. “He said that Mr. Mueller declined an opportunity to read his March 24 letter before Mr. Barr sent it to lawmakers. And Mr. Barr warned that trying to quickly summarize the report more fully would have exposed him to a minefield of potential criticism.”
Then, the next day, Barr dropped a bigger bombshell. From Politico:
The nation’s top law enforcement official on Wednesday appeared to back up President Donald Trump’s assertion that the Justice Department “spied” on his presidential campaign — an explosive comment that heightened partisan tensions ahead of the release of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report.
During his second day of Capitol Hill testimony this week, Attorney General William Barr also suggested that the Justice Department was gearing up to investigate the genesis of the counterintelligence probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election — a key rallying cry for Trump and his congressional allies that comes amid the president’s consistent claims that the Mueller report exonerates him.
“Spying on a political campaign is a big deal,” Barr told members of a Senate Appropriations subcommittee during a hearing about the Justice Department’s budget. “I think spying did occur. The question is whether it was adequately predicated. And I’m not suggesting that it wasn’t adequately predicated. But I need to explore that.
The charge of spying is indeed an incendiary one, and it predictably sent Democrats into a tizzy, mostly because Barr offered no proof to back up the allegation. Even he seemed to backtrack later in his testimony, but by then many saw it as a deliberate attempt to validate a Trump-approved conspiracy theory, one likely to complicate Barr’s already dicey relationship with Congress.
Chasing Amy: Truancy with a side of hotdish . On the heels of a $1 trillion infrastructure plan that drew wide media coverage, Sen. Amy Klobuchar last week pledged to create a clemency advisory board and a new White House position for criminal justice reform if elected president, both aimed at fighting “racism in our criminal justice system,” she said in a CNN Op-Ed.
If the proposal was meant to cut against the rash of stories questioning her tactics as Hennepin County prosecutor and her commitment to fighting racial inequities in jails and prisons, it was quickly met with another report about practices a Democratic electorate may find questionable.
Ex-MinnPoster Sam Brodey, now at The Daily Beast, detailed how Klobuchar tried to nudge children to stay in school by “vaguely threatening” prosecution through a fridge magnet handed out to parents. “Whether or not it actually happens, it changes a culture, and that’s part of what we’re trying to do here,” Klobuchar said of the magnet in a 2010 interview.
Brodey wrote “the tchotchke represented something darker to local activists who saw a policy that burdened the poor and people of color, and had the potential to create more chaos in the lives of the children the state was purporting to protect.” Klobuchar’s office maintains her anti-truancy strategy was focused on early intervention and expanded support services, not legal punishment.
Klobuchar this week also tangled with the NRA over an updated extension of the 1994 Violence Against Women Act, which passed the House with legislation to close the so-called “boyfriend loophole” aimed at stopping people convicted of stalking misdemeanors from owning guns. Klobuchar has championed her own “boyfriend loophole” legislation before it was included in VAMA.
On the campaign trail, Klobuchar made her first visit to Nevada, headlining a pro-union conference with Bernie Sanders and touting her infrastructure plan at a local middle school. The plan also includes money for updating schools.
In one measure of the strength of campaigns — fundraising — Klobuchar appears to be squarely in the second tier of candidates. She has raised $5.2 million in her first seven weeks of running for president. That puts her behind Sanders, Kamala Harris, Beto O’Rourke and even Pete Buttigieg .
The most stinging news of the week for Klobuchar, however, may have been her failure to win the Minnesota delegation’s annual hotdish contest. That honor went to St. Paul Rep. Betty McCollum , for her Hmong-themed “Hotdish A-Hmong Friends,” that includes five thai chilis and two egg roll wraps.
Elsewhere in the presidential race, Joe Biden’s supporters seem to be sticking with him after allegations of unwanted touching, and The New York Times reminds us that the Democratic electorate on Twitter does not reflect the actual electorate voting on the next nominee.
Also, it turns out Bernie Sanders is a millionaire, thanks to writing a best-selling book. He also pledged to release 10 years of tax returns. He won’t pledge, however, to nix the Senate filibuster to pass his Medicare-for-all plan. Jay Inslee , the Washington governor and noted watercolor painter/children’s book author, once again promised to get rid of the filibuster if elected president in a CNN Town Hall on Thursday.

Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a presidential candidate, unveiled the 2019 version of his “Medicare-for-all” bill this week. But even more than two decades after first proposing a single-payer plan for the U.S., Sanders still has not proposed a way to finance such a major undertaking.
Congress continued to pursue its examination of high prescription drug prices this week by calling to testify both insulin makers and the drug “middlemen” known as pharmacy benefit managers.
And Idaho is following Utah in trying to scale back an expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act approved by voters last November.
This week’s panelists are Julie Rovner of Kaiser Health News, Sarah Kliff of Vox.com, Margot Sanger-Katz of The New York Times and Paige Winfield Cunningham of The Washington Post.
Also, Rovner interviews Ceci Connolly, president and CEO of the Alliance of Community Health Plans.
Among the takeaways from this week’s podcast:
“Medicare-for-all” was in the spotlight again this week with the release of Sanders’ bill, which is co-sponsored by four of the five other Senate Democrats running for president. Still, neither Sanders nor any other candidates — or their proposals — focus on how to pay for it. Experts differ on how much expanding Medicare would cost. But, whether it’s moving around money already being spent or raising new taxes, expanding Medicare to more people would result in winners and losers, a key political factor going forward. Both parties face internal divisions over health care, revolving around whether to create something new or stick with the status quo. Within the GOP, the split is between Republicans who point to years of unsuccessful efforts to repeal and maybe replace the ACA and want to move on to other things, and others — including some in the White House — who are continuing the push. Democrats’ division is between those who back House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s call to strengthen and improve the ACA and those who back various efforts to create a Medicare-for-all system. The GOP is playing both offense and defense on the ACA. Leaders say they want to be the party of health care and protect people with preexisting medical conditions, even as the Justice Department is officially backing a court ruling in Texas that would invalidate the entire law, including those protections. There was lots of talk but little action on drug prices at hearings before Congress. Lawmakers heard from drug companies and pharmacy benefit managers, but are no closer to answering the question about what to do about high drug prices. While there may be incremental changes that can be adopted, few expect legislation that would fundamentally change business practices, intellectual property rights or the ability for Medicare to negotiate drug prices. Action in the Utah and Idaho legislatures around Medicaid expansion show that even successful ballot initiatives to expand the program can be changed by lawmakers in ways voters may not have expected. In both state capitols, elected officials reduced the number of people eligible for expansion below what voters approved. [khn—slabs slabs="799584" view="inline"]

Texto completo: Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said Tuesday he will be releasing 10-years worth of tax returns in the next week and admitted he himself is one of the millionaires he has decried throughout his political life.

The Democratic presidential candidate, who has been ridiculed in the past for owning extra properties including a beachfront home in New England, said in an interview with the New York Times that he will be releasing the tax returns in the spirit of transparency.

“April 15 is coming,” Sanders said in the interview. “We wanted to release 10 years of tax returns. April 15, 2019, will be the 10th year, so I think you will see them.”

During the 2016 campaign, when he faced off against Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination, Sanders released his 2014 tax returns, which was sparse compared to the eight years of tax returns Clinton made public.

Sanders also urged Trump to release his tax returns, saying the American people want to know where he stands financially. He also said that his own tax returns won't be as salacious as Trump's.

“On the day in the very immediate future, certainly before April 15, we release ours, I hope that Donald Trump will do exactly the same. We are going to release 10 years of our tax returns, and we hope that on that day Donald Trump will do the same," Sanders said. “Not being a billionaire, not having investments in Saudi Arabia, wherever he has investments, all over the world, mine will be a little bit more boring."

In an interview last week on "The Daily Show," Sanders was confronted by host Trevor Noah about his hesitance to release his tax returns as other 2020 candidates have already done. Noah quipped that typically politicians who refuse to make their tax returns public are attempting to hide something from the American voters.

“If Bernie hasn’t released them and Trump hasn’t released them, there’s probably secrets on both sides,” Noah told Sanders. “My theory is Trump doesn’t want us to know that he’s not a billionaire and you don’t want us to know that you are.”

Sanders has made taxing "the millionaires and billionaires" a central component of his presidential campaigns, both in 2016 and 2020, blaming the rich for ruining the American economy. ""We will no longer tolerate 46 percent of all new income going to the very richest people in this country," Sanders said in his campaign kickoff last month.

The Vermont lawmaker currently sits in second place for the Democratic nomination according to the latest RealClearPolitics polling average. He trails former Vice President Joe Biden, who has yet to announce a presidential run, by 8.6 percentage points.

Investigation gaslighted America

Texto completo: Can we finally give collusion a rest?
From the beginning, the premise that President Donald Trump is a Russian agent actively undermining America didn't seem to hold up. If it were indeed true, you'd hope for a different scenario.
You'd hope it'd be a Code Red-like situation with everyone in D.C. with their hair on fire. You'd hope top congressional leaders, top intelligence and military brass would quickly swing into action, depose the traitor president (through official means) and make America safe again.
Instead, while top Democrats and the national media screamed "collusion" and "treason" 24/7, everyone lived their lives and we had a plodding 22-month investigation while presumably the treasonous president kept doing treasonous things.
The word treason became, strangely, like white noise.
Meanwhile, though we don't have the full report yet, Robert Mueller's own words attest that there was no collusion between Donald Trump and his campaign with the Russian government to win the 2016 election.
Will Democrats continue flogging this dead horse? It looks like it.
When posterity writes the story of the Russia investigation, I hope they call it Operation Gaslighting America. Because that's what it was.
Post-2016 election, American voters were gaslighted by a severely anti-Trump cohort: top bureaucrats, the Democratic and media establishments including CNN, MSNBC, The Washington Post, The New York Times, etc.
For over two years, the country was divided into two alternative realities.
Liberals fervently believed that Trump was a Russian agent-and-colluder and that Robert Mueller would deliver the goods on Trump to them.
Conservatives, meanwhile, faced with startling revelations about the irregularities, abuses of power and conflicts of interest in the top echelons of the FBI, the CIA and the Department of Justice, came to believe that the investigation was a sham to smear, undermine and remove an outsider president.
But what happens when a liberal doesn't swallow the liberal narrative? Well, that happened to me. I'm a former Democrat who still counts herself a liberal who's become thoroughly disillusioned with the current left.
Starting with 2017, I got out of my partisan media bubble, sampled different media sources, rejected being force-fed cynical, pre-cooked, partisan narratives and came to a conclusion that didn't square with my political leanings.
Progressive readers won't agree, but the following became apparent to me in 2018: that Donald Trump's insurgent candidacy and presidency posed a unique threat to the governing elite status quo and that powerful, unelected bureaucrats in the FBI, CIA and the Department of Justice decided to thwart the wishes of the 63 million Trump voters.
Let's call it what it was: a slow-motion coup that was ultimately unsuccessful.
Russian interference in the election was relatively small scale compared to the collusion happening at the highest levels of government to thwart an outsider president.
Trump's democratic norm-breaking is small potatoes compared to the big-time democracy subversion that happened surrounding the Russia investigation.
Those who pointed out the well-documented holes in Russiagate were discredited and pilloried (wrongly) as conspiracy mongers and Russia tools.
There are, obviously, some heroes, villains and losers in this saga.
My heroes in this were the conservative journalists who doggedly investigated the issue. To name a few: Kimberley Strassel, Lee Smith of RealClearPolitics, Andrew McCarthy, Mollie Hemingway, etc.
Heroes too were the apostate liberals like Mark Penn, Glenn Greenwald, Alan Dershowitz, Matt Taibbi, etc., who, armed with facts and reasoning, questioned the investigation.
The villains were many prominent characters: top Democratic leaders like U.S. Reps. Adam Schiff and Eric Swalwell, media figures like Rachel Maddow and Carl Bernstein, national security officials like John Brennan, Jim Comey, etc.
The losers, unfortunately, were ordinary Democrats. To them, I'd humbly say: You were sold a bill of goods by your party leaders and trusted media sources. The national media made out like bandits in this by fomenting and then exploiting your anger, fears and frustration.
There are important reasons why a majority of Americans, myself included, have lost faith in our political institutions, our governing elite and our national media outlets.
The Russia investigation and events surrounding it are just one major reason why.

Texto completo: The Coachella headliners are Childish Gambino, Tame Impala and Ariana Grande.
And you've also got Janelle Monáe, Weezer, Kid Cudi, Kacey Musgraves, Wiz Khalifa and Solange already on your list. You're curious to see how actors-turned-artists Jaden Smith and Idris Elba do on stage.
But what about the 100 or so bands that you don't know a lot about? How do you pick someone to watch?
Here are 10 of my favorite "small-print" (in small type on the lineup poster) acts that I think you should give the old Coachella try. Because finding a new favorite is, to me, what Coachella is really all about.
Ella Mai Who: A 24-year-old British R&B singer/songwriter
Why: Ella Mai (named after Ella Fitzgerald by her mom) dishes out some soulful R&B similar to what was radio popular in the late 1990s. She is very close to not belonging on this list as she's already made quite a name for herself, appearing on Saturday Night Live in November. Think Lauryn Hill and Alicia Keys, two women she lists as influencing her music.
When: She plays on Friday (April 12 and 19).
Wallows Who: An Indie rock band out of Los Angeles
Why: This alternative rock trio just released their first album "Nothing Happens" in late March and you may have seen two of the three members as actors on TV. Dylan Minnette, on guitar and vocals, was the male star of the popular Netflix show "13 Reasons Why" and lead guitar Braeden Lemasters was an actor on the shows "Betrayal" and "Men of a Certain Age." But music is their primary passion and their sound is in the ballpark of "The Strokes."
When: They play on Saturday (April 13 and 20).
Lizzo Who: A 30-year-old American rapper/singer
Why: Straight up, this woman is fun. Her songs are sassy and strong and full of girl power. She can rap and sing equally well. You may have seen her around as she has appeared on late night shows and was a guest judge on Rupaul's Drag Race. You also may have heard her song "Worship," which has become the new anthem for Weight Watchers and is featured in their commercial. Hers is the music you put on when you're having a bad day, and need to turn it around.
When: She plays on Sunday (April 14 and 21).
Boy Pablo Who: A Norwegian indie pop band
Why: The band Boy Pablo (which has released two EPs, one called "Roy Pablo" and one called "Soy Pablo." Confused yet?) is a perfect day-time band for Coachella. Their sound is easy to listen to and sway with. Their song "Everytime" became a viral sensation in 2017 and has almost 20 million view on YouTube.
When: They play on Sunday (April 14 and 21).
Soccer Mommy Who: Sophie Allison, an American singer-songwriter born in Switzerland but who grew up in Nashville
Why: It's hard to peg her sound, but it has fun pop elements like a Taylor Swift or Avril Lavigne but at the same time much cooler, more sophisticated and emotional. No less than the New York Times named her 2018 album "Clean" the eighth best album of the year on its top 28 albums of 2018.
When: She plays on Sunday (April 14 and 21).
Bazzi Who: A 21-year-old singer, songwriter and rapper from Michigan of Lebanese descent
Why: Bazzi did not follow the traditional path to musical success. He gained popularity in 2018 when his song "Mine" was featured on a Snapchat lens filter and became a popular meme. You know, just like how Johnny Cash and Aretha Franklin came up back in the day. Anyway, I love Bazzi's sound. To put it matter-of-factly it oozes sexuality, almost like a male Jhene Aiko. The rest of the festival will temporarily melt away as you listen to it with that special someone.
When: He plays on Saturday (April 13 and 20).
Ookay Who: Abe Laguna, a Los Angeles-based EDM producer DJ and singer
Why: He has evolved from his origins as a purveyor of trap and house music into more pop-tinged songs. He had a dance hit with "Theif" in 2016 and has continued to find success, including collabos with Diplo and Marshmello, to name a few. He is my primary EDM target this year.
When: He plays on Saturday (April 13 and 20).
Juice WRLD Who: Jarad Higgins, a 20-year-old rapper from Chicago
Why: He is influenced by the likes of Chief Keef and Travis Scott, but also bends the genre a bit to include hard rock and even emo sounds. His 2019 album "Death Race for Love" debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard top 200. If you aren't already on board, it's time to get to know the name Juice WRLD. His music is everywhere: on the charts, on the radio and even in the movies as part of the "Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse" soundtrack.
When: He plays on Friday (April 12 and 19).
Sofi Tukker Who: A house music duo of Sophie Hawley-Weld and Tucker Halpern based out of New York
Why: These two are just plain crazy fun. I saw them at Coachella a couple years ago, and fell in love with their quirky style. And that's style in every sense: fashion, music and stage presence. You might have heard their song "Best Friend," which was featured in an iPhone commercial. Catch these guys if you can, there is not another act like them.
When: They play on Sunday (April 14 and 21).
Tierra Whack Who: A 23-year-old rapper and R&B artist from Philadelphia
Why: She's a gifted writer and rapper, but it's her creative videos that really stand out. Hopefully she'll bring some of that imaginative action to her Coachella set. A modern-day Missy Elliott, but maybe even more out there. A can't-miss.
When: She plays on Friday (April 12 and 19).

Poll says parents hinder children's life skills

Texto completo: While we're clucking over the college admissions bribery scandal, those of us with children too young to worry about higher education gaze up from our smartphones and remind our tweens and teens that schoolwork's due Friday and to pack their uniform for practice.
What's wrong with that?
Only that most of us still will be doing it when our children are in college.
Bribing SAT proctors, paying off college officials and lying about kids' athletic credentials is illegal, but it's also part of a pattern of today's parents taking control so their children succeed and avoid disappointment and failure.
A new poll conducted by The New York Times and Morning Consult showed that parents don't stop handling things for their children when they become an adults.
We don't stop removing obstacles to child frustration or defeat, thus earning ourselves the moniker of snowplow or lawnmower parents.
The poll looked at a nationally representative group of parents of children ages 18 to 28.
By the time kids are old enough for college and way beyond the point they should have graduated, parents — whether wealthy or not rich — are still doing things children can do for themselves. Such as:
76 percent reminded their adult children of deadlines they need to meet, including for schoolwork
74 percent made appointments for them, including doctor's appointments
15 percent of parents with children in college had texted or called them to wake them up so they didn't sleep through a class or test.
One of the most egregious findings of the poll is that 11 percent of parents with adult children will call their child's employer if he or she had an issue at work.
I guess it shouldn't be that surprising in that 8 percent of parents said they had contacted a college professor or administrator about their child's grades or a problem they were having.
The poll also found among parents of adult children that:
22 percent helped them study for a college test
16 percent helped write all or part of a job or internship application
14 percent told them which career to pursue
14 percent helped them get jobs or internships through professional network
12 percent gave more than $500 per month for rent or daily expenses
11 percent helped write an essay or school assignment
4 percent wrote all or part of an essay or other school assignment
The problem with this, according to Julie Lythcott-Haims, the former dean of freshmen at Stanford University and the author of "How to Raise an Adult: Break Free of the Overparenting Trap and Prepare Your Kid for Success," is that parents never let their children grow up. Growing up means making your own decisions, and sometimes, mistakes, she told The Times.
"The point is to prepare the kid for the road, instead of preparing the road for the kid," Lythcott-Haims said.
Lythcott-Haims said it's a difficult habit for snowplow parents to break the habit of being a child's fixer, always plowing away all the difficulties.
"If you're doing it in high school, you can't stop at college," she said. "If you're doing it in college, you can't stop when it comes to the workplace. You have manufactured a role for yourself of always being there to handle things for your child, so it gets worse because your young adult is ill-equipped to manage the basic tasks of life."
Lythcott-Haims said parents eventually have to take a back seat and let their kids drive their own life lives. "You can't just arrive them at the future you want for them. They have to do the work to build the skills," she said.

Texto completo: OAKLAND, Calif. — Picked-up pieces from 10 days out west with the Red Sox . . .
■ While the Sox struggle out of the gate (2-5, in last in the AL East after Wednesday's 6-3 comeback victory), several key Yankees are returning from injuries or have gone down since the season started: Giancarlo Stanton, Miguel Andujar, Didi Gregorius, Aaron Hicks, Jacoby Ellsbury, Dellin Betances, CC Sabathia, Luis Severino, and Troy Tulowitzki. This has not gone unnoticed in the Boston clubhouse. The West Coast time zone allows the Sox to monitor their rivals back east. Almost daily, while the Sox are playing cards, listening to music, and getting ready to take batting practice, their clubhouse TVs are tuned into Yankee games vs. Baltimore or Detroit. Playing against the tanking Orioles and Tigers, the Yankees lost four of their first six.
■ New York's injury bug makes it a good year for the Sox to start slow, but that doesn't diminish the overreaction back home. A Globe reader e-mailed me and asked if the 2019 Red Sox might be the first team eliminated from contention before they have a chance to raise their championship banner. This is why we love the Boston baseball market.
■ The Red Sox can spin it any way they want, but there's got to be something wrong with Chris Sale. Two starts, 49 fastballs, zero swings and misses.
■ Just wondering, but did the 1950s and '60s Yankees shut down Whitey Ford every spring training back in the days when Ford pitched in the World Series every year? Or are the Red Sox the first to invent the reduced spring workload plan that's worked so well in the first week of the 2019 season?
■ The Kremlinesque erasure of Larry Lucchino from Red Sox history continues. Accompanied by a photo of John Henry and Tom Werner, the Red Sox press guide officially cites the duo's “18th season as stewards of the Red Sox franchise," even though Lucchino was running the team for the first three championships of Henry's ownership. Theo Epstein, who got his start in baseball with tremendous help from Lucchino, became the latest “Larry Who?" revisionist when he told the Globe's Peter Abraham, “It's fun to see the organization have success and what John, Tom, and Sam [Kennedy] have accomplished."
■ QUIZ: Name the two active big league pitchers who have won both the Cy Young and Rookie of the Year awards? (answer below)
■ Love the Oakland Coliseum, but it is indeed a dump. It's now the fifth-oldest ballpark in baseball (trailing Fenway, Wrigley, Dodger Stadium, and Angel Stadium, though the last was significantly renovated). Revisiting the place this week reminded me of an Earl Weaver dustup with umpire Rich Garcia in 1979. Weaver was tossed early in the game but never left the dugout, opting to manage from the dugout bathroom. Garcia went looking for Weaver and pounded on the bathroom door, only to hear Earl say, “There's no one in here." When Garcia said, “I know you're in there, Earl," Weaver hollered, “Yeah, your umpiring was so bad it made me throw up, so I came in here."
■ More Coliseum: The joint opened for baseball on April 17, 1968, when the Orioles defeated the A's, 4-1, on a Dave McNally two-hitter. Oakland's second hit was a ninth-inning pinch single by little-known middle infielder Tony La Russa. It was LaRussa's only big league hit that season. He retired with 35. “Shows you what a horse [expletive] player I was," says La Russa. “My claim to fame is that I got the first pinch hit in the history of this stadium." La Russa went on to Cooperstown as the third-winningest manager in baseball history.
■ I was saddened to hear that the Red Sox manager's office at Fenway has been relocated to a space safely distanced from the prying eyes of the media. Through the decades, it's been informing to see who was going in and out of the manager's office. That is all gone now as the space has been allocated to team video coordinator Billy Broadbent. When I texted Terry Francona with news of the death of his old office, the Tribe manager fired back with, “Lots of good [expletive] buried in there."
■ One of the problems with baseball's pace of play is the fact that most players do not think there is a problem. Here's Bryce Harper in ESPN The Magazine: “Pitch clocks and all that? If you don't want to come to a baseball game, don't come. We're not a timed sport." Swell. But who's going to pay your salary if bored fans heed your advice?
■ Book list: Make sure you pick up “K: A History of Baseball in Ten Pitches" by Tyler Kepner of the New York Times. Kepner, a former Globe intern, is the best baseball read in American newspapers today. While you're at it, find “One Base at a Time: How I Survived PTSD and Found My Field of Dreams," by Red Sox groundskeeping czar David Mellor.
■ Remember when “Who's going to be the closer?" was the big question around the Red Sox?
■ The Sox would like to have Dustin Pedroia at second base for the home opener on Tuesday.
■ How did I go this long without knowing that Alex Cora's dad was a sportswriter? Jose Manuel Cora covered Criollos de Caguas in winter ball for the San Juan Star.
■ My Opening Day in Seattle started with an e-mail from 80-year-old southpaw Jim Kaat, a guy who won 283 big league games in 25 seasons and still works as a baseball television analyst. Kaat's playing career put him up against Ted Williams (who was a rookie in 1939) and Julio Franco (who played until 2007). It's the baseball life's equal of Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, who met both Abraham Lincoln and Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
“Baseball's opening day is so much more significant than the opening days of other sports," wrote Kaat. “This is my 60th MLB opener. I remember my first like it was yesterday. Ike threw out the ceremonial first pitch. Teddy Ballgame drove a Camilo Pascual fastball through the winds over the center-field wall, 421 feet. Camilo struck out 15. Still an opening day record. Game was played in 2:20."
Naturally, everything checked out when I went to Baseball Reference's website. On April 18, 1960, the Washington Senators defeated the Red Sox, 10-1, in front of 28,327 at Griffith Stadium. Cuban curveballer Pascual fanned 15 in his complete-game win. President Dwight Eisenhower threw out the first pitch and Ted Williams hit a long homer to center in the second inning for the Sox' only run.

Texto completo: HBO has agreed to lease a five-story office building under construction on Venice Boulevard in Culver City as the premium cable network cements plans to abandon its longtime corporate offices in Santa Monica.
HBO's new home -- beginning in 2021 -- will be part of the Ivy Station mixed-use development, a $350-million project that will include apartments, restaurants and shops. The site is adjacent to the Culver City station of the Metro Expo Line.
The developers on Wednesday announced that HBO, which was recently scooped up by AT&T Inc., would occupy all 240,000 square feet of office space in the complex. The cable network has been based at Colorado Center in Santa Monica since 2004.

Once-sleepy Culver City, the longtime home to Sony Pictures Entertainment, has been enjoying a cultural renaissance as Amazon Studios and numerous advertising and digital media shops have located there.
Last year, Amazon Studios moved into historic Culver Studios, and later decided to lease 75,000 square feet of office space at the new Culver Steps development across the street. Trendy restaurants also have moved into the neighborhood.
The Ivy Station development, scheduled to be completed next year, is bounded by Venice, National and Washington boulevards, with most of the complex in Culver City and a small part in the city of Los Angeles.
Tom Wulf, executive vice president of Lowe, one of the developers, said Ivy Station was attractive to HBO because it has easy access to public transit, lodging, shops and restaurants.
"HBO is an ideal business anchor," he said in a statement.
The development team also includes Aecom-Canyon Partners and Rockwood Capital.
HBO had been hunting for new digs for some time. With its lease in Santa Monica nearing its end, the network initially considered moving into a new Washington Boulevard office building near Culver City's art gallery district, but Apple Inc. ended up leasing that space instead.
News of the eventual move comes as HBO undergoes a major revamp as its new corporate bosses prepare to launch a streaming service later this year to compete with Apple, Netflix Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Walt Disney Co. The streaming service will showcase programming from HBO and other TV networks, including TBS and TNT, which now are owned by AT&T.
HBO has been directed to expand its programming pipeline just as its signature hit "Game of Thrones" unfurls its final season. The marching orders came from AT&T, the Dallas telecommunications giant that last summer spent $85 billion to acquire Time Warner Inc., which was the parent company of HBO and its sister network Cinemax.
Time Warner also owned CNN, the Turner channels TBS, TNT and Turner Classic Movies and Burbank-based Warner Bros., which is Hollywood's largest television and film studio, cranking out such hits as "Batman," "Wonder Woman," "Harry Potter" and "The Big Bang Theory." AT&T renamed the entertainment group WarnerMedia and selected phone company veteran John Stankey to be its chief executive.
Last month, Stankey shook up the corporate suites at several of the media properties, including HBO. Its longtime chairman and chief executive, Richard Plepler, abruptly announced his departure, followed by the former head of Turner, David Levy. Stankey named former NBC Entertainment Chairman Bob Greenblatt to take over HBO and several of the Turner networks.
WarnerMedia Entertainment Chairman Greenblatt will work at the Ivy Station campus alongside the HBO staff. The New York company said Wednesday that it hasn't finalized all its staffing plans for the new offices in Culver City.
Ivy Station is envisioned as a roughly 500,000-square-foot campus of contemporary-style, mid-rise buildings. It will feature 200 apartments, 50,000 square feet of ground-floor retail and restaurant space and a 148-room hotel. The brand of the hotel will be identified later, the developers said.
Financial terms of HBO's 15-year lease were not disclosed, but landlords in the area typically ask for about $4.50 a square foot a month, according to statistics compiled by real estate brokerage CBRE.
Lowe expects the complex to be a busy way station on the Expo Line, which arrived in Culver City in 2012 and now carries more than 60,000 riders each weekday, according to the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The complex will have 1,500 underground parking spaces, 300 of which will be dedicated for use by Metro passengers.
The station is also served by multiple bus lines, and there will be a bike-sharing outpost and a staffed, enclosed bicycle station where nearly 400 cyclists at a time can safely park their two-wheelers or have a bike mechanic repair them.
The name "Ivy Station" is one of the oldest relics of Culver City. An early 20th century map of the "Los Angeles Pacific Co. Electric Railway" connecting L.A. with the coast shows a junction of two lines at Ivy Park, where Culver City now lies. A Mission Revival-style electrical substation was built in 1907 to converted alternating current to direct current for the railway, and it still stands on Venice Boulevard, where it is used as a theater.

Fact deficit + opinion media surplus = bankrupt democracy

Texto completo: In the current Broadway hit “Network,” TV anchor Howard Beale implores his viewers to go to their windows and yell: “I’m mad as hell, and I’m not going to take it anymore!”
Played brilliantly by actor Bryan Cranston, Beale gets fired, says he plans to kill himself on the air, and then gets a new show because he’s become a sideshow and ratings sensation.
In 2019, we don’t have anchors threatening their demise, but we have plenty of cable news hosts stoking emotions, demonizing people in the political system, and manipulating viewers to keep tuning in to hear the latest cataclysmic predictions.
Hot rhetoric designed to inflame
Since I saw “Network” in February, I’ve been thinking about the corrosion to our real-life democracy that occurs when some forms of media — particularly cable “talking head” opinion shows and social media — exploit citizens with hot rhetoric that’s designed to inflame.
Finding workable solutions to problems — in government, in business and in the nonprofit world — cannot occur without a clear understanding of facts and a rational evaluation of potential responses. Substantively addressing a challenge doesn’t involve name-calling, disinformation and screaming.
Yet Minnesotans and all Americans live in a society in which they can easily be seduced into escaping their everyday lives and marinating in a daily diet of negative talk TV, which increases polarization and partisan tribalism.
Easy to bully and belittle
On Twitter, which lacks face-to-face conversations with fellow citizens, it’s easy to bully and belittle people as well as condemn those who fail to demonstrate ideological purity on the left or right of the political spectrum.
The bruising nature of our political discourse provides ample evidence that we’ve fallen into the trap that the late professor Neil Postman forecast in his book, “Amusing Ourselves to Death.” Postman, who taught at New York University, warned in his 1985 book that television valued entertainment above everything else, and that it would trivialize how we handle public policy issues.
More than three decades after the book’s publication, television has had a profound influence in reshaping politics and journalism. A politician’s success is greatly linked to an ability to communicate persuasively, and sometimes outrageously, on television. Presidential candidates try to demonstrate they can be entertaining and hold their own with late night comedians. Meanwhile, TV and the internet have combined to produce the 24/7 news cycle. The most tantalizing headlines are broadcast in a repetitive loop and partisan spinmeisters work as paid analysts on talk shows.
Are we shouting ‘mad as hell’?
In 2019, how much time are we spending in a fit of rage while watching incensed pundits on television? Like the viewers in “Network” are we shouting that we are “mad as hell” to members of our own political tribe? Are we cheering when our favorite politician delivers a speech with time-worn talking points that never translate into effective policies?
How do we claw our way out of our current political quagmire that rewards divisions and political grandstanding?
The first action we can take is reduce cable TV and social media time and read more news articles reported by professional journalists.
Reporters know how to vet information, interview people with a range of opinions, find valid data and provide context on issues because of the expertise they’ve developed as beat reporters. While the number of newspaper journalists has dropped by 45 percent since 2008, those still employed are valiantly seeking the truth.
In recent weeks, some of the best accountability reporting has been done by the Seattle Times, which carefully covers Boeing and the aviation industry. It has dug deep to uncover problems with the new Boeing 737 MAX, which has had two fatal crashes. The Times reporters had aviation knowledge and access to credible news sources that allowed them to raise key issues. They knew what detailed questions must be posed to Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration.
High quality costs money
High quality journalism isn’t free. Yet a recent Pew Research Center study showed that 84 percent of U.S. adults surveyed did not pay for local news in the past year.
To pay their journalists, the Star Tribune and Pioneer Press rely on subscriptions, and MinnPost and MPR depend on contributions. If the news organizations don’t receive strong financial support, they will be forced to make cuts and many important stories won’t be covered.
If people reduce their dependence on incendiary opinion media, there’s a secondary benefit. They’ll have more time to engage with their communities in constructive ways. They can get to know neighbors on their blocks. They can tutor children. They can join a civic or religious organization and complete a project that helps other people.
After turning off the TV and setting aside their phones, they also can spend some time thinking or reading a book. It’s OK to take time to reflect.

Burger King is rolling out a meatless Whopper

Texto completo: Burger King, whose quarter-pound Whopper pushed its competitors a half-century ago to create their own two-fisted hamburgers, now plans to roll out a vegetarian version of its signature sandwich, relying on plant-based patties developed by San Francisco Bay area start-up Impossible Foods. The Impossible Whopper will be introduced this week at Burger King restaurants in the St. Louis area - in the very state that last year banned the use of the term "meat for any vegetarian or cell-based substitutes for animal-raised meats.
Burger King's plan could be the impetus that motivates the highly competitive fast-food burger industry to push for more meat alternatives at a time when beef production has raised countless alarm bells for its contributions to methane production and climate change.
A Burger King spokesperson told the New York Times that if the Impossible Whopper succeeds in the Show Me State, the company will expand distribution to all 7,200 restaurants nationwide. Such a move would make the chain the undisputed king of the fake-meat burger. White Castle sells an Impossible Slider at its 370-plus locations. Red Robin has just introduced an Impossible Cheeseburger at its 570 locations, and this year Carl's Jr. rolled out the Beyond Famous Star, a vegetarian version of its signature burger featuring a plant-based patty from Beyond Meat, at more than 1,000 locations.
But Burger King will have a few difficult tests to pass before deciding to expand the Impossible Whopper to locations across the country. For starters, the veg version will cost nearly a dollar more than the original Whopper, a significant increase in the price-sensitive fast-food market. The Impossible Whopper will also have to deal with consumer skepticism as larger companies move into the meat alternatives market. What's more, Impossible Foods took heat last year from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals for the start-up's seemingly contradictory stance on animals: Impossible Foods wants to save the lives of countless livestock, but the company simultaneously tests the heme molecule - which is responsible for the "beefy taste of the vegetarian patty - on laboratory rats.
Yet Burger King does have one advantage as the chain introduces the Impossible Burger: The patty will be based on Impossible's 2.0 formulation, which the company announced this year, according to CNET. The new formulation, according to the tech magazine, can better withstand the rough treatment that patties, beef or otherwise, receive in a fast-food environment. The company's latest vegetarian patty is also, apparently, good enough to fool taste testers. A CNET reporter sampled the Impossible patty after it was grilled on one of Burger King's flame broilers and substituted for the meat in a Whopper purchased from a bricks-and-mortar location.
"The remarkable thing was how unremarkable they were: Nothing gives away the fact that this Whopper contains a different main ingredient, Brian Cooley wrote.
Should Burger King make a success of the Impossible Whopper, the billion-dollar question is: What will McDonald's do in response? McDonald's has more than triple the sales of Burger King in the United States, according to a QSR magazine chart based on 2016 sales. McDonald's has a McVegan burger available only in Finland and Sweden.
But if history in any indication, McDonald's could be pressed to introduce its own veg burger, should the public take a shine to the Impossible Whopper. In his 1977 autobiography, "Grinding It Out: The Making of McDonald's, Ray Kroc, the man who transformed McDonald's into a fast-food behemoth, wrote, "The Big Mac resulted from our need for a larger sandwich to compete against Burger King and a variety of specialty shop concoctions.
Could history repeat itself?

Texto completo: KIEV, Ukraine - A young television comic and novice candidate trounced Ukraine's political elite in the first round of the presidential election, official results showed Monday - a stinging rebuke by an electorate tired of the lack of change in a country dominated by rich businessmen.
Results released by the Central Electoral Committee showed that Volodymyr Zelensky, 41, who is famous for playing a schoolteacher accidentally vaulted into the presidency, led the field with more than 30 percent. He received 5.2 million votes, almost double the number of his nearest competitor, President Petro O. Poroshenko, who had just under 16 percent.
Yulia V. Tymoshenko, a former prime minister who has run for president twice before, came in third with more than 13 percent. The turnout was more than 63 percent in an electorate of 30 million, the electoral commission said.
Since no candidate garnered more than 50 percent of the vote, Zelensky and the apparent second-place finisher, Poroshenko, will face each other in a runoff in three weeks, on April 21.
As soon as the polls closed Sunday and exit polls indicated that there would be a runoff, the two leading candidates began bashing each other.
Zelensky presented himself as an insurgent facing a tired old guard that had refused to take him seriously. He walloped a field of 38 other candidates representing different political blocs in Ukraine, most of whom attracted only small fractions of the vote.
A Zelensky adviser described the outcome as the culmination of a series of uprisings in Ukraine in 2004 and 2014 that succeeded in overthrowing governments but failed to break the grip of the oligarchs who control economic and political life, as well as the media.
"This is a struggle so that the political system finally starts working not for its own benefit, but for the benefit of the people," said Dmitri Razumkov, a political consultant for Zelensky. "Despite two revolutions, nothing has changed in our country."
Zelensky has been vague about what he would do as president, and at one point tried to crowdsource his program by suggesting that supporters contribute thoughts via social media. Voters might demand more in the second round.
There have also been suspicions that he is a front for Ihor V Kolomoisky, a Ukrainian tycoon who fled to Israel amid a banking scandal. Both men have denied any secret pact.
Poroshenko, 53, conceded Sunday night that he had lost the confidence of young voters weary over the slow pace of change and the continuing economic woes. But he said that the time for joking was over and that Ukraine needed a leader who could confront both its socioeconomic problems and, more important, the conflict with Russia.

The Associated Press
WASHINGTON - A career official in the White House security office says dozens of people in President Donald Trump's administration were granted security clearances despite "disqualifying issues" in their backgrounds, such as concerns about foreign influence, drug use and criminal conduct.
Tricia Newbold, an 18-year government employee who oversees the issuance of clearances for some senior White House aides, says she compiled a list of at least 25 officials who were initially denied security clearances last year because of their backgrounds. But she says senior Trump aides overturned those decisions, moves that she said weren't made "in the best interest of national security."
Newbold's allegations were detailed in a letter and memo released Monday by Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, chairman of the House Oversight and Reform committee. Cummings panel has been investigating security clearances issued to senior officials including Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner, former national security adviser Michael Flynn, and former White House aide Rob Porter.
The documents don't identify the officials on Newbold's list but they note that two are "current senior White House officials."
The release of the information comes about a month after The New York Times reported that Trump ordered officials to grant Kushner a clearance over the objections of national security officials and after Newbold spoke out to NBC News and other news outlets about her concerns.
It also sets the stage for another fight between the White House and the Democratic-controlled House. Cummings said he will move this week to authorize his first subpoena in the probe.
Cummings said the subpoena will be for the deposition of Carl Kline, who served as the White House personnel security director and supervised Newbold. He has since left the White House for the Defense Department.
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.
Rep. Jim Jordan, the committee's ranking Republican, said in a statement that Cummings' probe is a "partisan attack" and an "excuse to go fishing" through personnel files. He also said that one person on Newbold's list is a GSA custodian.
Newbold laid out her experience in the White House during a March 23 interview with bipartisan committee staff. Portions of that interview were in the memo released by Cummings.
According to the memo, Newbold's list of overturned security clearance denials included "two current senior White House officials, as well as contractors and individuals throughout different components of the Executive Office of the President."
"According to Ms. Newbold, these individuals had a wide range of serious disqualifying issues involving foreign influence, conflicts of interest, concerning personal conduct, financial problems, drug use, and criminal conduct," the memo says.
Newbold said she raised her concerns up the chain of command in the White House to no avail. Instead, she said, the White House retaliated, suspending her in January for 14 days without pay for not following a new policy requiring that documents be scanned as separate PDF files rather than one single PDF file.
Newbold said that when she returned to work in February, she was cut out of the security clearance process and removed from a supervisory responsibility.
The committee has previously singled out Flynn, Porter and Kushner as it sought records from the White House about how their clearances were handled.
Flynn maintained his clearance even after the White House learned he lied to the FBI about his conversations with Russia's ambassador and that he was under federal investigation by the Justice Department for his previous foreign work.
Kushner failed to initially disclose numerous foreign meetings on security clearance forms, and according to the Times, career officials recommended against granting him one before Trump personally overruled them.
Porter had high-level access with an interim security clearance even though the FBI repeatedly told the White House of past allegations of domestic violence lodged against him by two ex-wives.
Porter resigned after the allegations becoming public.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Marking the 70th anniversary of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the world's most famous NATO critic – President Donald Trump – focused Tuesday on the money paid by members of the historic U. S. -European military alliance.
“Tremendous progress has been made,” Trump said in welcoming NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg to the White House.
Stoltenberg thanked Trump for his "strong commitment to NATO," especially his "strong leadership on burden sharing. ”
Though Trump and Stoltenberg frequently say nice things about each other, their latest meeting took place amid tensions over Trump's attacks on the alliance, especially his claims that some countries don't contribute enough to mutual defense.
"There are many countries that take advantage of us very seriously, both at NATO and on trade," Trump told a group of U. S. governors Feb. 25, though he praised NATO countries for increasing defense spending by about $100 billion in recent years.
"I have a great relationship with the leaders – but we have to be treated fairly," Trump said.
At Tuesday's meeting, Trump took credit for an increase in defense funding by some NATO members, but he said the organization's spending goal – 2% of gross domestic product per country – "may have to go up. "
“When I came, it wasn’t so good, and now they’re catching up," Trump said.
Nicholas Burns, a former U. S. ambassador to NATO, called Trump's comments "extremely disappointing," noting that the president did not discuss the 70th anniversary or NATO's accomplishments over those seven decades, including its help in Afghanistan after the 9/11 attacks on the USA.
"He only paid attention to one issue: how much money they're paying," Burns said. "That's all he cares about. "
Charles Kupchan, an adviser on Europe for President Barack Obama, said Trump sees NATO as a political issue, and getting allies to do more was one of his pledges. Trump simply "declared victory on the spending front," Kupchan said, and that enabled him to praise NATO as much as he ever has during his meeting with Stoltenberg.
"Supporters of NATO like me breathed a sigh of relief," said Kupchan, a professor of international affairs at Georgetown University.
Trump often casts NATO spending in terms of how other countries owe the United States money, but that is not how NATO finances work: Each country pays for NATO commitments out of its own defense budget.
During a summit in 2014 in Wales, NATO members agreed to increase defense budgets, so they would be at least 2% of their gross domestic product by the year 2024.
Stoltenberg, who has a series of 70th-anniversary events in Washington this week, including an address to a joint session of Congress, has often downplayed NATO disputes with Trump.
"The strength of NATO is that, despite these differences, we have always been able to unite around our core tasks," he said before leaving Brussels on Monday. "That is, to protect and defend each other. ”

Criticism of international alliances, including NATO, has been a hallmark of Trump's political career.
During his presidential campaign, Trump claimed NATO had become "obsolete. " In a speech at his first NATO summit as president in 2017, Trump did not endorse the commitment of the 29 alliance countries to come to the defense of any member that is attacked. The president has frequently complained that too many NATO members, particularly Germany, don't spend enough money on mutual defense.
During a White House news conference with Stoltenberg in April 2017, Trump changed his tune about the relevance of the alliance: “I said it was obsolete. It's no longer obsolete. ”
A few weeks after returning from the NATO summit, Trump did endorse the mutual defense commitment contained in Article 5 of the NATO treaty signed in 1949.
In January, The New York Times reported that "several times over the course of 2018," Trump privately told advisers he wanted to withdraw from NATO, a move that would all but destroy the alliance.
A few days later, in a speech at the Pentagon, Trump expressed support for NATO but included a warning. “We will be with NATO 100%," he said, "but as I told the countries, you have to step up. "
Trump repeated the 100% line in his Oval Office meeting Tuesday with Stoltenberg, who has often served as a bridge between NATO members and the critical U. S. president.
Some NATO members remain suspicious of Trump, fearful he is willing to undermine the alliance that remains on the front lines in the fight against terrorism. Critics said a weakened NATO would be less willing to contain an expansionist Russia threatening Ukraine and other neighbors.
Two former U. S. ambassadors to NATO, Burns and Douglas Lute, wrote in a report released in February that Trump "is regarded widely in NATO capitals as the Alliance’s most urgent, and often most difficult, problem. "
In the report – titled "NATO at Seventy: An Alliance in Crisis" – Burns and Lute said NATO did not hold a major summit to mark the 70th anniversary because "they feared President Trump would blow up a meeting in controversy as he has done each time he has met with NATO leaders during the past two years. "
NATO has a scaled-back summit scheduled for December in London, in addition to ceremonial events this week in Washington.
Burns, a professor of diplomacy and international relations at Harvard University, said too many leaders of NATO countries believe Trump doesn't want to lead the alliance but has instead become its "chief critic. "
"The president has been, at best, ambivalent about the alliance," he said.
Some analysts said they expected Trump to mute his criticism of NATO during this week of commemorations.
Despite Trump's attacks, NATO has remained resilient and popular with U. S. lawmakers and the public, Kupchan said.
"At the end of the day, he's a politician, and I just don't see anything in it for him" to attack NATO, he said. "I don't see how Trump would consider that to be a political winner. "

Burger King’s Whopper gets an Impossible version

Texto completo: Burger King has begun testing an Impossible Whopper in 59 St. Louis restaurants with an eye to rolling out the plant-based protein option to all of its U.S. locations.
If Burger King’s partnership with Impossible Foods expands, it would be a coup for the Bay Area company that’s dedicated to “making meat using plants.” Burger King is in the top 10 largest fast food chains, frequently listed at No. 6.
Impossible Foods has captured diners’ attention with its signature product, the Impossible Burger, which it markets as being as tasty as beef and requiring far less land, water and other natural resources to produce.
It’s aimed at flexitarians, people who like meat but want to cut down on their consumption for ethical or health reasons.
Impossible Foods also markets itself as a tech company and created a stir last January at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas with the debut of its Impossible Burger 2.0.
Among the improvements to the product was making it hold together better on grills, thus making it easier for restaurants that flame-broil burgers to serve it.
Beyond Meat, Impossible Foods’ main competitor, announced a partnership with Carl’s Jr. for its Famous Star, placing its Beyond Burger in 3,800 restaurants. Del Taco is moving forward with Beyond Tacos.
Plant-based meats typically cost more than beef, about $2 more at Carl’s Jr. Burger King did not announce the price of its Impossible Whopper in St. Louis but released a video of Whopper lovers proclaiming that they can’t tell the difference.
Burger King is considering a rapid rollout of the Impossible Whopper to 7,200 U.S. restaurants, according to the New York Times. Company representatives affirmed it’s a possibility.
Burger King announced the Impossible Whopper on April Fool’s Day, but in a news release said the Whopper is real and the news is not a whopper.
The Impossible Burger is currently available in more than 5,000 U.S. restaurants, according to the news release. That’s a lot of growth since April 2018, when the Impossible Burger was something of a novelty at events such as the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.
Most national chains that serve the Impossible Burger are casual restaurants rather than fast food chains. Red Robin Gourmet Burgers and Brews added it to its menu on April 1 as an option for any of its burgers. With more than 570 restaurants in the United States and Canada, it claims to be the largest chain currently serving it.

Reap results; Ways to focus and increase productivity

Texto completo: Ever wish you had 30 hours in a day to get more stuff done? Then again, how tired would you feel? You may already be exhausted after working eight or nine hours per day.
Well, if you're struggling to juggle work and life while trying to maximize your day without killing your health in the process, remember this: Being more productive doesn't mean working harder or longer; it means working smarter.
Here are six ways to be more productive, the smart way:
1. Cut down the distractions
Distractions are productivity's biggest enemy. To make the most of your day, ax whatever is keeping you from being focused and productive. Take your work environment into account. Is sound/noise, lighting, the way the room is configured, such as open-floor plans, a problem?
Try relocating to a different space or make a case for working remotely. The key is finding out what distractions are messing with your productivity, and then doing something about it.
2. Have good boundaries
Let me ask you: What's most important for you to get done? Whatever it is, focus all your energy on those things.
Take billionaire Warren Buffett, for example. With all the demands on him every day, Buffett learned a long time ago that the greatest commodity of all is time. He simply mastered the art and practice of setting boundaries for himself.
The mega-mogul once said, "The difference between successful people and really successful people is that really successful people say no to almost everything."
3. Simplify
Productive people are masters of simplifying things down to what matters most. They have a simple schedule. They live according to their values and purpose. They have no problem saying no to people or things that don't serve them.
If something coming their way on Tuesday has little value and doesn't make them better on Wednesday, they simply walk away.
4. Exercise the Pomodoro Technique
If done correctly, this classic time-management hack can help you get things done in short work intervals. First, decide on the tasks you want to check off from your to-do list. Next, set a timer to 25 minutes and knock off those items until the timer rings.
After you finish, take a five-minute break and repeat the cycle four times. After the fourth cycle, take a 15- to 30-minute break and start over.
The key is to focus on the short bursts, as it helps you to concentrate on your tasks without distractions.
5. Take more breaks
This sounds counterintuitive to being more productive at first, but according to a New York Times article, research shows that "daytime workouts, short afternoon naps, longer sleep hours, more time away from the office, and longer, more frequent vacations" actually boost productivity and job performance.
The truth is, humans aren't wired to concentrate for more than three hours at a time. Anything beyond that without a break and you'll start to experience the negative effects of decision fatigue, lack of focus and even impaired vision.
6. Schedule your to-do list items
This productivity hack helps you be more realistic about what you want to get done.
Cal Newton, author of "Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World," says: "Scheduling forces you to confront the reality of how much time you actually have and how long things will take. Now that you look at the whole picture, you're able to get something productive out of every free hour you have in your workday. You not only squeeze more work in, but you're able to put work into places where you can do it best."

Texto completo: BEIRUT - Syrian militiamen paid by Iran have seen their salaries slashed. Projects Iran promised to help Syria's ailing economy have stalled. Even employees of Hezbollah, the Lebanese group that has long served as Iran's closest Arab ally, say they have missed paychecks and lost other perks.
Iran's financial crisis, exacerbated by U.S. sanctions, appears to be undermining its support for militant groups and political allies who bolster Iranian influence in Iraq, Syria,. Lebanon and elsewhere.
"The golden days are gone and will never return," said a fighter with an Iranian-backed militia in Syria who recently lost a third of his salary and other benefits. "Iran doesn't have enough money to give us."
Across the Middle East, Iran's allies are showing signs of financial strain.
Some of that strain may simply reflect the impact of the prolonged armed conflicts in Syria and Iraq. Hezbollah, which had focused resources on confronting Israel along Lebanon's southern border, has been diverting fighters and weapons to Syria for years. Shiite fighters directed by Iran helped battle the Islamic State after the militant group overran parts of Iraq five years ago.
But Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, acknowledged the difficulties created by the U.S. sanctions this month, criticizing them as "a form of war" and calling on the movement's fund-raising arm "to provide the opportunity for jihad with money and also to help with this ongoing battle."
The Trump administration says the strains show that the sanctions are effective. It sought to intensify the pressure Tuesday by blacklisting 25 participants in what the Treasury Department described as a vast currency trading scheme that had funneled more than $1 billion to Iranian military operations in the region.
"Our pressure on Iran is simple," Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said during a visit to Lebanon last week. "It's aimed at cutting off the funding for terrorists, and it's working."
But analysts question how much funding cuts will change the behavior of these groups, which are relatively inexpensive, remain ideologically committed to Iran's agenda and can promote it through local politics in ways that the United States struggles to thwart.
Iran has long relied on relationships with groups across the Middle East to boost its influence, serving as a patron of Hezbollah in Lebanon, Shiite militias in Iraq and Syria, the Palestinian militant groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad, and the Houthi rebels in Yemen.
While the extent of Iran's support varies by group, the strategy has allowed it to project power beyond its borders, countering the United States, vexing Saudi Arabia and menacing Israel.
Last year, President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the Iran nuclear deal and reimposed sanctions, hoping to undermine Iran's ability to fund its network of alliances.
Analysts who study Iran and its allies said much remained unclear about how the financial stress would affect the allies' activities.
Iran maintains relatively low levels of military spending, unlike Saudi Arabia and Israel, America's principal partners in the region., and many of its allies have income streams that give them some financial independence.
And recent history suggests that financial pressure on Iran does not necessarily lead to military cutbacks.

Trump criticizes Central American nations, day after security pact

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump on Thursday criticized El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras for accepting monetary aid from the United States but doing "Nothing" in return, a day after his Homeland Security secretary struck an agreement with those same countries to strengthen security on the U.S. southern border.
Trump also lashed out at Mexico for doing "NOTHING" to stem the flow of immigrants illegally entering the United States, even as Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen met with Mexican officials Tuesday about security issues.
Nielsen met with Central American officials in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, on Wednesday to discuss the humanitarian crisis and what the Trump administration considers a security emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border.
"I'm pleased to announce the U.S. & our Northern Triangle allies have reached a HISTORIC agreement to confront the root causes of the crisis on our border," Nielsen said in a Twitter post Wednesday. "Working with Central American govts to increase security & prosperity in the region has been one of my greatest priorities."
It was not immediately clear what sparked Trump's outrage early Thursday, but it comes on the heels of the
House Democrats' refusal to sign off on a Defense Department request to redirect funds to be used to help build the president's border wall.
"Instead of focusing on readiness, hurricane recovery and other genuine issues, the administration continues to spend billions of dollars on an imaginary crisis," Rep. Adam Smith of Washington, the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said in a statement Tuesday.
The Trump administration has long described the situation at the southern border with Mexico as a national security emergency, but Democrats have disputed that characterization.
The acting defense secretary, PatrickM. Shanahan, said Wedresday that despite the objection from lawmakers, the Pentagon would move forward with the plan to reprogram funds to be used for the border wall.
In February, Trump declared a national emergency on the Southern border, providing for military funds to be shifted to help build thewall. The decision sparked outrage from Democratic and Republican lawmakers over the constitutional separation of powers.
The president vetoed a resolution to block his declaration, and Tuesday the House failed to overturn that veto.

Outed CIA spy Valerie Plame and diplomat husband Joe Wilson are divorced

Texto completo: One-time Washington power couple Valerie Plame and Joe Wilson quietly divorced in 2017 after nearly two decades of marriage, according to state divorce records.

Plame, who told the Washington Examiner on Friday that she is planning to run for U.S. Senate in New Mexico, does not mention the divorce on her website, which still references “her husband, Ambassador Joseph Wilson.” It was her second marriage and his third.

Wilson, a former ambassador to Gabon, and Plame, a former CIA operative, rose to national celebrity after Plame’s identity was leaked to the press by Richard Armitage, sparking a federal investigation in 2003. Plame and Wilson were vocal critics of the Iraq war and parlayed their notoriety into lucrative book and movie deals in the mid-2000s. The glamorous couple were the subject of the 2010 movie "Fair Game", which featured Naomi Watts as Plame and Sean Penn as Wilson.

Wilson and Plame currently own a sprawling 2-acre estate in Santa Fe, which they unsuccessfully put on the market for $2.1 million in the spring of 2017. The 4,609-square-foot Pueblo style home features 11 fireplaces, a separate guesthouse, and stunning views of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. The former couple has 19-year-old twins, Trevor and Samantha.

Plame, 55, and Wilson, 69, first met in 1997 at a reception at the Turkish ambassador’s residence. At the time, Wilson was still married to his second wife, but by the next year he had divorced her and married Plame.

Wilson, a retired U.S. ambassador to Gabon, was sent by the CIA on a “fact-finding mission” to Niger in 2003 to investigate whether Saddam Hussein bought yellowcake uranium from the country. Wilson went on to write an op-ed in the New York Times claiming that he found no evidence of the purchase and throwing doubt of the Bush administration’s rationale for the Iraq war.

Shortly after Wilson’s op-ed was published, Washington Post columnist Robert Novak wrote a column noting that Wilson’s wife worked at the CIA. The “outing” of Plame’s identity led to a Special Counsel investigation of the Bush administration to determine who leaked her name to Novak, and to the eventual conviction of Bush official Scooter Libby on obstruction of justice charges. Libby was pardoned by President Trump last April.

Richard Armitage, an aide to then-Secretary of State Colin Powell, later admitted to leaking Plame’s identity to Novak.

Plame has written three books - two spy novels and one memoir about the scandal over the leak of her name. She and Wilson have twin children, Trevor and Samantha, who are 19.

In 2007, she wrote about the strain the "outing" had put on her marriage. "It was so distorted, so twisted, and Joe was furious with me because he felt he had defended me gallantly, and I was not coming to his defense – although he understood that as an employee of the [Central Intelligence] Agency I could not speak publicly.

"It was just tearing us apart. Maybe I shouldn’t say this, but I felt the only thing that will save my marriage, is that goddamn it, I’m not going to let them have that too. We will get through this."

A federal district court judge in Washington, D.C., has blocked work requirements for Medicaid recipients in Arkansas and Kentucky. Since the Arkansas program took effect in 2018, more than 18,000 people have lost health coverage because they failed to report their work hours to the state.
Meanwhile, the Trump administration changed its position in a lawsuit filed by Republican state officials challenging the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act. The administration is now officially supporting cancellation of the entire health law in light of Congress’ elimination in the 2017 tax bill of the penalty for failing to have insurance.
This week’s panelists are Julie Rovner of Kaiser Health News, Joanne Kenen of Politico, Margot Sanger-Katz of The New York Times, and Kimberly Leonard of the Washington Examiner.
Also, Rovner interviews filmmaker Mike Eisenberg about his movie “To Err Is Human: A Patient Safety Documentary.”
Among the takeaways from this week’s podcast:
In blocking the Arkansas Medicaid and Kentucky work requirements (Kentucky for the second time), U.S. District Judge James Boasberg said the Trump administration’s approval “did not address … whether and how the project would implicate the ‘core’ objective of Medicaid: the provision of medical coverage to the needy.” A last-minute Department of Justice filing in another pending court case — this one renewing questions of whether the Affordable Care Act is constitutional — has thrown the national health care debate on its ear. The Trump administration Monday night changed its position on the case. Last summer, it refused to defend the health law in full, but said the tax law changes eliminating the penalty for not having insurance should result in only a few closely related provisions being declared unconstitutional. Now the administration agrees with the lower-court ruling in the case that the entire ACA is invalid. Democrats were thrilled by what they see as a political misstep by the president. Democrats rode the health issue to victory in many 2018 elections and see this as an opening to pursue the issue even more strongly in 2020. House Democrats this week also unveiled proposals to expand and shore up the ACA. The final sign-up numbers are in for individuals purchasing coverage on the ACA’s health exchanges. While enrollment dropped slightly, to 11.4 million, the continued stability of the individual insurance market suggests that eliminating the tax penalty is having less of an impact than some supporters of the law had feared.

What will life be like for Trump, Democrats in post-Mueller report world?: Today's talker

Texto completo: Special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation is complete, the final report is submitted, and his staff is beginning to close up shop. Now, politicos and commentators are wondering what the political landscape will look like in a Washington no longer hanging on Mueller's every move.
Quit slinging mud about Mueller
By Kathie Obradovich
All of the hubbub over the Mueller report in Congress reminds me of a fifth-grader poring over a comic book while his homework piles up on the desk, gathering cobwebs.
That’s not to say special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation was a waste of time or that the report, whatever may become public, will not be worth a careful review. The opposite is true. It’s just that the time and energy that Congress has and will spend on either trying to take down or defend the president comes at the expense of a better future for the entire country.
If nothing else, the anti-climactic summary of the Mueller report should free up time for the president and Congress to focus on health care, infrastructure, disaster recovery, immigration, environmental protection, cybersecurity, campaign reform, international trade, financial regulation and a host of other pressing issues.
Talker: Jussie Smollett case underscores why many don't report violence against them: Today's talker
Maybe that’s why President Donald Trump doesn’t want to quit while he’s ahead. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S. C. , said Monday he wants an investigation into why the government started investigating Russian interference and possible Trump collusion in the first place. Republicans must need some new excuse to avoid governing the country.
Mueller’s team spent two years investigating Russia's role in the 2016 presidential election and concluded that it did, indeed, interfere. The investigation racked up an eye-popping 34 indictments. Those convicted or facing charges include six members of Trump’s campaign and some of his inner circle.
That Trump was, according to his attorney general’s summary, cleared of collusion doesn’t change the fact that the president has denied Russian interference, sided with Russian President Vladimir Putin’s denial, and hasn't done much to make sure it doesn’t happen again in 2020.
House Democrats will, of course, pick at every loose thread — especially the inconclusive determination of whether Trump obstructed justice. But they would be better served to direct their zeal toward using the report’s findings and any follow-up hearings to draft and pass ethics, campaign finance, cybersecurity and criminal justice legislation aimed at stopping the next Paul Manafort, the next Michael Cohen, the next wave of foreign hackers and yes, Donald Trump, from lining their pockets, paying off porn stars, making a mockery of our election process, and climbing into the pocket of hostile dictators.
Democrats will not be elected or re-elected by obsessing over Trump. Their best chance is to work on accomplishing something that will improve the lives of their constituents back home.
Kathie Obradovich is the opinion editor of the Des Moines Register, where a longer version of this first appeared. Follow her on Twitter: @KObradovich
What others are saying
Barbara McQuade, USA TODAY: "The full Mueller report . . . could still include facts damaging to Trump and his presidency. He also faces multiple congressional investigations into foreign influence, his finances and his White House personnel practices. And one of special counsel Robert Mueller’s grand juries continues to investigate 'robustly,' according to a federal prosecutor in court on Wednesday. Mueller delivered his report, but for President Donald Trump, this is far from over. "
Karl Rove, The Wall Street Journal: "Trump now has an unusual chance to fashion something like the presidential honeymoon that media bitterness over Hillary Clinton’s loss denied him when he took office. Team Trump should use the Mueller report to pivot to issues, like the economy and the opioid crisis, that matter to swing voters who will decide the 2020 presidential election. . . . After all, he was proved right and his worst detractors were proved wrong. But reiterating old grievances about the investigation’s unfairness won’t materially change (his approval) ratings. "
Charles M. Blow, The New York Times: "Trump’s opponents should be thanking their lucky stars that Mueller filed his report nearly 600 days before the presidential election, long before all of the Democratic candidates have even declared their candidacy, long before the first debates. . . . Trump has no idea how to ride a win. He seems to see every news cycle as him starting from scratch. He couldn’t even let the Mueller findings breathe before suffocating them. "
What our readers are saying
In spite of wild protests about "full report" and "collusion! conspiracy! treason!", these people don't really believe it. What they really wanted was to find some way to leverage the Mueller investigation to find past shady financial dealings that the Trump family might have done in the last five decades.
— Tesla Dominico
I'm pretty sure the American people aren't voting for Donald Trump because he didn't commit this particular crime. His level of stupidity and corruption means if he gets voted into office a second time, we are our own worst enemies.
— Famj Jensen
The Democrats will parse the report, word for word, to find anything to use against President Trump. Look for many more investigations by the House.
— Norman Hopkins
I accept that Trump is the "rightful" president in that he won the electoral vote. However, that does not change the fact that he is unfit for the office.

Texto completo: While we're clucking over the college admissions bribery scandal, those of us with children too young to worry about higher education gaze up from our smartphones and remind our tweens and teens that schoolwork's due Friday and to pack their uniform for practice.
What's wrong with that?
Only that most of us still will be doing it when our children are in college.
Bribing SAT proctors, paying off college officials and lying about kids' athletic credentials is illegal, but it's also part of a pattern of today's parents taking control so their children succeed and avoid disappointment and failure.
A new poll conducted by The New York Times and Morning Consult showed that parents don't stop handling things for their children when they become an adults.
We don't stop removing obstacles to child frustration or defeat, thus earning ourselves the moniker of snowplow or lawnmower parents.
The poll looked at a nationally representative group of parents of children ages 18 to 28.
By the time kids are old enough for college and way beyond the point they should have graduated, parents — whether wealthy or not rich — are still doing things children can do for themselves. Such as:
76 percent reminded their adult children of deadlines they need to meet, including for schoolwork
74 percent made appointments for them, including doctor's appointments
15 percent of parents with children in college had texted or called them to wake them up so they didn't sleep through a class or test.
One of the most egregious findings of the poll is that 11 percent of parents with adult children will call their child's employer if he or she had an issue at work.
I guess it shouldn't be that surprising in that 8 percent of parents said they had contacted a college professor or administrator about their child's grades or a problem they were having.
The poll also found among parents of adult children that:
22 percent helped them study for a college test
16 percent helped write all or part of a job or internship application
14 percent told them which career to pursue
14 percent helped them get jobs or internships through professional network
12 percent gave more than $500 per month for rent or daily expenses
11 percent helped write an essay or school assignment
4 percent wrote all or part of an essay or other school assignment
The problem with this, according to Julie Lythcott-Haims, the former dean of freshmen at Stanford University and the author of "How to Raise an Adult: Break Free of the Overparenting Trap and Prepare Your Kid for Success," is that parents never let their children grow up. Growing up means making your own decisions, and sometimes, mistakes, she told The Times.
"The point is to prepare the kid for the road, instead of preparing the road for the kid," Lythcott-Haims said.
Lythcott-Haims said it's a difficult habit for snowplow parents to break the habit of being a child's fixer, always plowing away all the difficulties.
"If you're doing it in high school, you can't stop at college," she said. "If you're doing it in college, you can't stop when it comes to the workplace. You have manufactured a role for yourself of always being there to handle things for your child, so it gets worse because your young adult is ill-equipped to manage the basic tasks of life."
Lythcott-Haims said parents eventually have to take a back seat and let their kids drive their own life lives. "You can't just arrive them at the future you want for them. They have to do the work to build the skills," she said.

Ted Cruz says media has 'egg on their face' for wall-to-wall Russia collusion coverage

Texto completo: Sen. Ted Cruz says the media have much to answer for after two years of non-stop coverage of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russian collusion probe that largely exonerates President Trump.

The Texas Republican told Fox's Sean Hannity Tuesday night the media has “egg on their face.”

“We've had now two years of this special prosecutor investigation, and during the entire time, virtually every Democrat and all of the media has been breathlessly covering every minute of it — insisting collusion, collusion, collusion, collusion,” Cruz said.

Over the weekend, Attorney General William Barr said Mueller’s report found no evidence to suggest that President Trump’s team colluded with Russia.

Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein also concluded from the report that there was no direct evidence to support charges of obstruction of justice against Trump.

“Everything the Democrats and media have been talking about for two years was lacking in a factual basis,” Cruz said. “And the entire media has egg on their face, and what are they doing now? They are not apologizing, they’re not backtracking, they’re not saying: ‘Gosh, our facts were wrong.’ Instead, they are attacking.”

When Mueller’s report came out, several of those outlets defended their coverage.

“We wrote a lot about Russia, and I have no regrets,” Dean Baquet, executive editor of the New York Times, said. “It’s not our job to determine whether or not there was illegality.”

The president of CNN, Jeff Zucker, also said he stood by the network’s reporting.

“We are not investigators. We are journalists, and our role is to report the facts as we know them, which is exactly what we did,” Zucker said. “A sitting president’s own Justice Department investigated his campaign for collusion with a hostile nation. That’s not enormous because the media says so. That’s enormous because it’s unprecedented.”

Cruz, a 2016 GOP primary rival of Trump, said Tuesday he expects House Democrats to push impeachment proceedings, despite the Mueller report's findings.

“Mark my words,” Cruz said. “The House Democrats are going to impeach the president anyway. Not because of any evidence, not because of any crimes, but because of the fact he is Donald Trump, and they hate Donald Trump. It is showing just how extreme they are.”

Meet the part-time Texans
By Manny Fernandez in Donna, Tex.
It's springtime on the border, and that means the winter season is winding down -- the months when tens of thousands of retirees from Minnesota, South Dakota, Illinois and other parts of the Midwest adopt South Texas as their home away from home.
Retirees in swimsuits ride their bicycles to the pool, bright noodles tucked under their arms like jousting lances. They line the streets for golf-cart parades. They venture into Mexico, shopping for cheap medicine, getting pedicures, undergoing low-cost dental work and sipping goblet-sized margaritas.
They are known as Winter Texans, and they concentrate mainly in the Rio Grande Valley, the temperate region deep in South Texas that is also the place where the largest number of migrants has been crossing lately from Central America -- President Trump has declared a national emergency along the border and stationed Army troops to help control the escalating influx. One of their base camps was a quarter-mile from where seniors at the Victoria Palms resort in Donna deploy by the dozens to occupy five pickleball courts.
The annual invasion of Midwesterners -- and a number of Canadians -- has decreased in recent years, but they remain an economic and cultural force. An estimated 106,000 Winter Texans spent about $528 million in the valley in the 2017-18 winter season, according to a survey by the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley. Tex-Mex restaurants fly welcome banners for them. There are Winter Texan newspapers, age-qualified RV parks, expos, cruises, theater productions and bumper stickers -- one pickup truck in the border city of McAllen had two: "Iowa Winter Texan" and "I'm retired. Go around."
"It gets me out of the snowbanks," said Dean Miller, 58, a resident of Detroit Lakes, Minn., who spends the winter living and working at the Winter Ranch resort in Alamo. "You'll go to some event down here and you'll find your neighbor from back home."
The majority of Winter Texans are white and in their early 70s. Many of them voted for Mr. Trump in 2016, and their very presence this winter quietly subverted the president's assertion that the border is in crisis. They have been coming to the region for years -- in some cases, their parents were Winter Texans, too -- and the political dynamics and national-emergency rhetoric has no effect on how, or where, they spend their retirement.
"We don't see what you see on TV," said Terry Goss, the general manager of Victoria Palms, one of the largest Winter Texan communities, with up to 2,500 retirees.
What do Winter Texans see, exactly?
A slice of border life that looks nothing like what many Americans think of as border life. There was Nathan's fourth annual Sock Hop at Ranchero Village in Weslaco one Friday. There were fish frys and riverboat tours, line dancing and karaoke sessions, bluegrass acoustic jams and nondenominational church services. At the Winter Ranch resort in Alamo one Monday afternoon, the Winter Ranch Players packed the house with three one-act plays, "The Ethel and Albert Comedies." At Victoria Palms, Mr. Goss spoke standing next to a poster listing all the sold-out shows at the resort's ballroom, one of them a Rolling Stones tribute band concert. Victoria Palms is so popular with Canadians that a Victoria Palms reunion is scheduled most summers near Toronto.
Margaret Hitzemann, 63, who normally lives in Onamia, Minn., spent the past two months in a townhouse in Port Aransas, near Corpus Christi. One rainy afternoon, she and her husband visited the Mexican tourist town of Nuevo Progreso. They bought crispy chapulines -- crickets, a fried delicacy -- and went into a pharmacy to buy some cheap medicine.
"We don't take a lot of meds, so we were thinking, 'Oh, let's go down and get some cheap Tylenol and Advil and that kind of thing,"' Ms. Hitzemann said. "I was like, 'Oh my gosh, this isn't any cheaper than Walmart.' So we ended up not buying any medications."
In a region with a large Latino population and tolerant attitudes toward immigration -- many people have family members on both sides of the border -- culture clash with the Northerners is inevitable. The study released by the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley included unedited messages from Winter Texans to local officials, and some of the sharpest comments read: "Be more American, less Mexican. This is not Mexico!" and "Have channel 5 respect Mr. Trump" and "Keep the grass cut, the trash picked up and speak English."
Already, the exodus back north has started. The end of the season for many comes on Thursday, with the annual Winter Texan appreciation day in Nuevo Progreso.
For some, the season never ends. There are Converted Texans, former Winter Texans who settle in the valley for good. Kristi Collier, a McAllen native who runs a media and hospitality company that caters to Winter Texans called Welcome Home, Rio Grande Valley, hosts an annual Converted Texan Fiesta in April. (She leads a swearing-in ceremony.)
Among the ranks of the converted are Ken and Lois Lane, originally from Anchorage, who started spending winters at Victoria Palms in 2005. They now live there permanently in a double-wide mobile home.
"I think the cost of living here is very reasonable, compared to many other places," said Mr. Lane, 73, a retired power dispatcher for an electrical company.
He and his wife visited Nuevo Progreso and hosted their son and his family from Iowa over spring break. The couple is in a unique category: sort of reverse Winter Texans.
"The motor home we kept and in the summer when it gets real hot, we go up north," Mr. Lane said.
Manny is one of a team of New York Times journalists currently reporting from the border. Each week they'll be sharing a slice of their reporting about the border and the people who spend time on both sides of it .

Quote of the week
"There are people out there who just say, 'Send them all back and build a wall.' But they would be facing empty shelves in the grocery store if that were to happen."
-- Mike McMahon, a dairy farmer in upstate New York.
The farms of upstate New York are thousands of miles from the southern border, but close enough to the northern one that the Border Patrol has jurisdiction. Farmers' reliance on undocumented workers had made the region a focal point in the debate over the Trump administration's border policies, leading to tensions between state politicians of both parties and the federal agents enforcing the president's crackdown on illegal immigration.
Christina Goldbaum, an immigration reporter in The New York Times's Metro department, explored Mr. McMahon's story, and those of migrants who work at farms like his, in an article this week. Read more about it here.
Border stories, in audio form
This week, KPBS, a public radio station in Southern California, launched a new podcast, "Only Here," about life and culture in San Diego and Tijuana -- "the art, food, traditions and culture that exists because of the border," they write. The first episode profiles a young photographer who is gay and undocumented, and you can listen to it, along with other episodes, here.
Podcast creators, like everyone else, have been drawn to stories and conversations about the border. If you prefer your stories in audio form, here are a few more to get you started:
"The Green Line," produced by the union of Border Patrol agents. The hosts, Art Del Cueto and Brandon Judd, are Border Patrol agents who have been supportive of President Trump's policies -- and both appeared at his side in the White House briefing room in January when he talked about declaring a national emergency to help build a border wall. (The Times has written about them before.)
Last spring, WNYC's Radiolab ran "Border Project," a three-part series about a Border Patrol policy that most likely led to a rise, beginning in the late 1990s, in the number of migrants who died while crossing to the United States. It also profiles some of the migrants who made the trek despite it. Listen to all the episodes here.
This episode of PRX's Radio Diaries, "The Border Wall," focuses on those strange parts of the border that one woman calls a "no-man's land," cut off from their country by a barrier that doesn't always follow the line it's meant to.
Our very own "Daily" podcast has many great episodes from the border. Start with a two-part series, "Dispatches From the Border" (Part 1 here and Part 2 here), which follows Azam Ahmed, the Times bureau chief for Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, and other Times journalists on a trip along the nearly 2,000-mile border with Mexico. Then there's this episode, "The Scars of Family Separation," about a migrant father who crossed the border with his daughter. Finally, from last summer, "How Separating Migrant Families Became U.S. Policy" is an interview with Stephen Miller, a senior policy adviser who has helped the president frame his immigration policy.

Guitarist and singer strike graceful balances in mid-19th-century pieces

Texto completo: Timothy Burris is mostly heard as a lutenist, both on recordings and in his capacity as the director of Portland Early Music and a member of Music's Quill. But in 2015, he decided to have a guitar made by the Canadian luthier Richard Berg, and being a period instrument type, he wanted the instrument to be a copy of a specific mid-19th century guitar.
The instrument in question is a guitar made by the great Spanish luthier Antonio de Torres Jurado in 1864, and played by the composer-virtuoso Francisco TÃ¡rrega for about 20 years. The model, known as FE17, was sold after TÃ¡rrega's death to Domingo Prat, an Argentine guitarist who passed it on to his student, MarÃ­a Luisa Anido, who became a prominent guitarist in the early 20th century. The original is currently in the guitar collection of Jonathan Kellerman, the crime novelist.
Burris unveiled the instrument in October 2016, in a program of Baroque and early 19th-century music, all vividly played but mostly from a time much earlier than the Torres - and in some cases, for the double-strung, thin-waisted Baroque guitar, a very different kind of instrument. When I reviewed that concert, I noted that it would be great to hear Burris perform music by TÃ¡rrega and his contemporaries on the instrument.
At his recital with mezzo-soprano JÃ¶lle Morris on Saturday night in the chapel at the Cathedral of St. Luke's, he didn't do that, exactly - there were no works by TÃ¡rrega, Arcas, Llobet or Pujol (some of which he played at the Portland Public Library in July 2017) - but Burris did focus on music composed between 1862 and 1870, just before and after Torres built FE17.
The composers were fairly obscure, even for guitar aficionados, but they offered a glimpse of what Spanish guitarists-composers were writing when Brahms, Liszt, Wagner, Dvorak and Tchaikovsky were busy elsewhere. In truth, the guitar music of the mid-19th century was not at the level of those composers; it would take until the 1950s and '60s for composers of truly international stature (like Benjamin Britten, William Walton and Hans Werner Henze) to become interested in writing for the guitar, thanks to the enterprising commissioning program undertaken by guitarist Julian Bream.
In the 1860s, the guitar was still finding its modern voice and technique. That voice was pretty delicate. The Torres guitar was a bit smaller than today's model, with a gentle sound. And the music's accent, not surprisingly, was tinged with Spanish folk influences and those of the Hispanic world. Several of the works Burris and Morris offered were built on the rhythms of the Habanera, a Cuban dance that had made its way to Spain, and Burris closed the program with a tango, a form imported from Argentina.
There is considerable charm in this repertory, especially the vocal selections, all either composed or arranged by TomÃ¡s Damas. A few of the songs - "¡AsÃ­ son todos!" and "La Hichecera," most notably - sounded like refugees from Bizet's "Carmen," despite the fact that the first was described as an arrangement of a popular American dance. Damas' "Te Amo," by contrast, was strikingly dramatic and the graceful chromaticism of "Lejos de Ti" drew on the emotional extroversion of flamenco singing. Morris sang them with a smooth, appealing tone, and a suitably Mediterranean interpretive suppleness.
Of course, the sound of the Torres recreation - sweet, warm, resonant and rounded - was an attraction in itself, and Burris framed the program with solo guitar works. Those were steeped in a folkloric style as well, but you could always hear an effort to bend those elements toward greater formality.
That meant a graceful balance between the modal, Moorish-influenced melody and the accompanying bass line in Jaume Bosch's "Plainte Moresque" (Op. 85), percussive effects in MatÃ­as de Jorge Rubio's "Danza Habanera" and vibrant Habanera rhythms supporting an attractive, extroverted melody in Damas' "La Sensible."
But the most ambitious pieces were Antonio Cano's introspective "Andante Grave" and a pair of works by JosÃ© ViÃ±as - "El Platano," a tango, and "Pensamiento Espresivo," a character piece built largely of artificial harmonics, the bell-like sounds created when a finger is placed lightly and a string, and lifted just as it is plucked. Burris wisely saved these for last, and gave them focused, technically assured readings.

Resumen: According to reports, Manhattan federal prosecutors have subpoenaed documents from the inauguration committee in the hope of learning where its money came from, what perks were expected in return and how it was spent. New York state prosecutors are probing native New Yorker Trump's charitable foundation, and the state's attorney general opened a civil investigation into Trump's business dealings after Cohen told Congress that Trump exaggerated his wealth to obtain loans. State Attorney General Letitia James has issued subpoenas to Deutsche Bank and Investors Bank seeking records related to four Trump real estate projects and his failed 2014 bid to buy the NFL's Buffalo Bills, according to a person familiar with the inquiry.

Texto completo: The long-awaited details of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigative report remained under wraps Saturday, with Attorney General William Barr holding off for at least one more day on the release of its major conclusions to a deeply-divided nation and Congress.
Barr ignored questions from reporters as he arrived at his U.S. Department of Justice office, while House Republicans and Democrats awaited word on any details from the 675-day probe that ended Friday with Mueller's submission of his findings to the country's top prosecutor.
Despite rumblings that the investigative cliffhanger might end Saturday with release of the report's "principle findings," word came later that nothing would become public until Sunday at the earliest.
The delay leaves an increasingly-anxious country awaiting definitive answers to a pair of key questions: Did President Trump's campaign actually collude with the Kremlin to sway the 2016 presidential election? And did Trump take steps, including the firing of FBI Director James Comey, to obstruct any investigation of possible collusion?
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, in a statement on Saturday, reiterated her call for release of the Mueller report in its entirety.
"Even if DOJ chooses not to prosecute additional individuals, the underlying findings must be provided to Congress and the American people," said Pelosi, who arranged an afternoon phone caucus with fellow Democrats. "The attorney general's offer to provide the committees with a summary of the report's conclusions is insufficient."
Trump, who has repeatedly denounced the probe as a "witch hunt," remained mute Saturday while staying at his Florida golf club. The President offered not so much as a single tweet about Barr, Mueller or the completed investigation that led to charges against 34 people, including former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort and former national security adviser Michael Flynn.
Five Trump aides pleaded guilty, including his former personal lawyer, longtime confidante and fixer Michael Cohen, and all agreed to cooperate with Mueller. Trump pal Roger Stone still faces a Washington, D.C., trial on charges of witness tampering and lying to Congress.
Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani said the report had so far been handled in accordance with the special counsel regulations. Under typical circumstances, the Justice Department won't make public damaging information about people unless they are charged with a specific crime - and Giuliani urged the same approach with the Mueller report.
The DOJ should prevent the release of "classified, privileged or defamatory statements unless there are charges, and there are none," Giuliani told the Daily News on Saturday. "It's up to them. I'm ready for anything since (Trump) did nothing wrong."
New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, in a Saturday tweet, urged Barr to make the report public without giving the Trump administration or the President's lawyers an advance peek at its contents.
"The White House must not be allowed to interfere in decisions about what parts of those findings or evidence are made public," said Schumer.
The White House had already said the President was not briefed on the report or its contents, leaving Trump to wait along with everyone else.
Mueller and his wife went out to dinner with another couple Friday night, and the prosecutor - his 22 months on the job now complete - said nothing Saturday as the wait for the report stretched across another day.
Mueller did not recommend any additional indictments, a disclosure that was good news for an assortment of Trump family members and associates.
Donald Trump Jr. had arranged a Trump Tower meeting during the 2016 campaign with an attorney linked to the Kremlin. And Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kusher, was questioned at least twice by investigators in Mueller's office.
Rather than ending Trump's legal woes, Mueller's decision to pass on further indictments just shifts them back to the President's hometown.
A separate probe into payments of hush money to women who claimed they had affairs with Trump continues in the Manhattan federal prosecutor's office. The investigation into the alleged payoffs to adult film star Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal led Manhattan prosecutors to note in court papers that Cohen paid off the two women "in coordination with and at the direction of" Trump.
The Brooklyn federal attorney, based on evidence seized from Cohen's Manhattan office, is reportedly looking into donations given to the Trump inaugural committee, The New York Times has reported.
Trump's inaugural committee raised about $107 million for lavish ceremonies. That's more than twice what was raised for President Barack Obama's first inauguration, even though Trump's inauguration involved smaller, more intimate gatherings.
According to reports, Manhattan federal prosecutors have subpoenaed documents from the inauguration committee in the hope of learning where its money came from, what perks were expected in return and how it was spent.
Federal prosecutors are also looking into whether foreigners, including some from Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, used inauguration donations to gain influence, the New York Times reported in December.
New York state prosecutors are probing native New Yorker Trump's charitable foundation, and the state's attorney general opened a civil investigation into Trump's business dealings after Cohen told Congress that Trump exaggerated his wealth to obtain loans.
State Attorney General Letitia James has issued subpoenas to Deutsche Bank and Investors Bank seeking records related to four Trump real estate projects and his failed 2014 bid to buy the NFL's Buffalo Bills, according to a person familiar with the inquiry.
Manafort was indicted earlier this month by Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance Jr. for a residential mortgage fraud scheme.

Texto completo: Pawel Pawlikowski's acclaimed "Cold War" is streaming on Amazon. And Netflix releases the next season of "The OA."
What's Streaming
COLD WAR (2018) Stream on Amazon. This latest black-and-white film from the Oscar-winning Polish director Pawel Pawlikowski packs a decades-long romance into a swift 89 minutes. That it includes Polish, French, German, Russian, Italian and Croatian dialogue hints at its country-hopping nature. It begins in the Polish countryside at the end of the 1940s, when a musician, Wiktor (Tomasz Kot), and his colleague, Irena (Agata Kulesza), travel among villages recording the music of the people living there. While traveling, Wiktor meets Zula (Joanna Kulig), a singer. Romance ignites between them amid a thorny political landscape. They struggle to navigate that landscape -- together and apart and together again -- for years after, in several European countries. In her review for The New York Times, Manohla Dargis praised the film's "two knockout leads" and the cinematography, which, she wrote, "is filled with ordinary and surprising beauty, with gleaming and richly textured surfaces, and the kind of velvety black chiaroscuro you can get lost in."
THE OA Stream on Netflix. The second season of "The OA" takes place in a new city -- and a new dimension. Created by Brit Marling and Zal Batmanglij, this puzzling thriller series introduced the young Prairie Johnson (Marling) in her small hometown in Michigan after she had been missing for several years. Calling herself, mysteriously, "the OA," she gathered a group of teenagers and one teacher (Phyllis Smith) for a "mission" that culminated in a polarizing end. Those attracted to the series' narrative risks will like the complicated setup of Season 2: After jumping into another dimension, Marling's character finds herself in San Francisco as a wealthy heiress. She teams up with a private detective (Kingsley Ben-Adir) to investigate a teenager's disappearance. And in the dimension where Season 1 took place, the teenagers and their teacher try to pick up the pieces.
THE LAST RACE (2018) Stream on Hulu; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. This slim documentary looks at speed and those who pursue it at Riverhead Raceway, the last remaining car racetrack on Long Island, which once bursted with them. Mixing racing footage with film of the drivers working their day jobs, the documentary is more or less equally interested in the racing and the culture that surrounds it. In his review for The Times, Glenn Kenny wrote that the director, Michael Dweck, clearly considers that culture lively and eccentric, "and does a committed job trying to convey that."
What's on TV
THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS (2001) 9 p.m. on Syfy. This first movie in what became a franchise stars Paul Walker as an undercover Los Angeles police officer in the nitrous-oxide-propelled world of illegal street racing. Pair it with "The Last Race" on Hulu for distinct approaches to car culture on different coasts.

Model, Fox News and Trump Tweets Bring 'Jexodus' Effort Mainstream

Texto completo: CORRECTION APPENDED. WASHINGTON -- At 23, Elizabeth Pipko has branded herself on social media as a onetime figure skater, a part-time poet and a former Trump campaign aide, an Instagramista whose feed spotlights her Mar-a-Lago wedding and racy swimsuit and lingerie modeling shots.
But when President Trump latched onto Ms. Pipko's concept of a "Jexodus" -- a fledgling, and some would say crass, effort by Republicans to woo Jews away from the Democratic Party -- even Democratic leaders found themselves defensively responding to a young woman they did not know existed a month ago.
The rise of Ms. Pipko and the notion of a Jexodus -- there is no evidence that any such thing is occurring -- is an object lesson in how an idea can migrate from a no-name messenger to the broad body politic, through the organ of Fox News and the megaphone of the president's Twitter account.
"We left Egypt, and now we're leaving the Democratic Party," Ms. Pipko declared last week on "Fox & Friends," the president's favorite television program, prompting a flurry of tweets about Jexodus from Mr. Trump, and an angry retort from Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the House Democratic leader.
About that exodus: Some 79 percent of Jews voted for Democrats in last year's midterm elections, according to exit polling data, up from the 71 percent who voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and the 69 percent who voted for Barack Obama in 2012. And Jews take a dim view of Mr. Trump, according to a 2018 Gallup poll that found that just 26 percent of Jews approved of the president's performance, the lowest of any major religious group.
And about that name, Jexodus. "Obviously, it's a play on Exodus," Ms. Pipko said on Fox. (There was, of course, an Exodus in the Bible. It involved Jews. So why the J? Is the next step renaming Passover as "Jassover"?)
"The Exodus is the most important master class in redemption in human history, and it is the ground for why we care about all those who are oppressed by slavery," said Rabbi Jonah Pesner, the director of the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism. "To crush that redemptive narrative into the crucible of partisan politics, I find very troubling."
The Palestinian-American writer Yousef Munayyer took a lighter view. "Jexodus," he said, reminded him of "a bad Weird Al Yankovic parody" of Bob Marley: "Movement of Jah people."
Jexodus may have gotten the hint on the name. On Thursday, its leaders announced that they were rebranding it "the Exodus Movement," an initiative of Red Sea Rising, incorporated by Ms. Pipko as a tax-exempt "social welfare" organization. On Wednesday afternoon, the Jexodus.org website was taken down; a new one, TheExodusMovement.com, went live on Thursday.
But on the mission, Ms. Pipko said she was undeterred. "We're obviously super-realistic and aware that overwhelmingly, the Jewish people have supported Democrats over the years," Ms. Pipko said in an interview, though she added, "I love a challenge."
In a strategy memo shared with The New York Times, she wrote that she intended to use "extensive microtargeting" to find "persuadable Jews" in eight states -- Florida, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Nevada, Arizona, Colorado, Michigan and Minnesota -- where Jews make up more than 2 percent of the vote in a total of 31 House districts.
The effort comes at a fraught moment for Israel supporters in the Democratic Party. Two freshman Democrats -- Representatives Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan -- embrace the boycott-Israel movement and have been fending off charges of anti-Semitism for weeks. The Republican National Committee and the National Republican Congressional Committee have streamed out a barrage of news releases accusing Democrats of anti-Semitism or coddling anti-Semites.
A New York native and granddaughter of Marc Klionsky, a Russian-born Jewish painter, Ms. Pipko -- who was described on the Jexodus website as an "international model, Trump 2016 campaign staffer, poet, patriot and fiercely proud millennial Jew" -- is not new to media attention.
A 2015 Esquire article about her said she "took a year off from minoring in mathematics at Harvard to train for the Olympics in figure skating," though her LinkedIn profile notes that she attends the Harvard Extension School, not Harvard College, and her skating career was derailed, she said Wednesday, by an injury when she was 15. Her poetry books -- "Sweet 16" and "About You" -- were self-published: "Her skin was luscious, peachy clean. Her eyes a chocolate brown. Her smile full of life. The envy of her town."
While Ms. Pipko is the public face of Jexodus, the idea originated with Jeff Ballabon, an adviser to the 2016 Trump campaign and self-described "very traditionally observant Jew" who said he was deeply disturbed by the rising tide of anti-Israel sentiment on the progressive left.
In an email, he said he came up with "Jexodus" as a "rallying cry" to help make it "O.K. for Jews to be proudly independent or Republican or even active Trump supporters." And he lamented "the nightmare we have now where a major party believes it has a lock on the Jews and so is free to court Jew haters."
He announced the new group at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington this month, along with Sebastian Gorka -- a former Trump White House official who has been accused of a decades-old alignment with Nazi groups in his native Hungary.
"CPAC attendees: check out the awesome #JEXODUS swag & tweet pics wearing it!" Mr. Ballabon wrote on Twitter.
Mr. Gorka declined to be interviewed. "I will not assist a publication clearly dedicated to a monomaniacal political agenda of undermining the duly elected president of the United States," he said in an email.
Jexodus, now the Exodus Movement, is making its debut just days before 18,000 people -- including Vice President Mike Pence, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and top congressional leaders -- are to gather in Washington for the annual policy conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the pro-Israel lobbying behemoth.
Mr. Trump, despite his own history of trafficking in anti-Semitic tropes, is clearly trying to exploit the moment. "There is anti-Semitism in the Democratic Party," he wrote on Twitter last week, quoting Ms. Pipko's Fox appearance.
That raised the hackles not only of Democrats, but of the foreign policy establishment.
"The deployment of Jexodus is vintage Trump," said Aaron David Miller, Middle East program director at the Wilson Center, a foreign affairs research organization, "a cynical, Twitter-friendly conceit designed to undermine bipartisanship -- critically important to a healthy U.S.-Israeli relationship -- by trying to establish the Republican Party as the go-to party on Israel and in the process tar the Democrats with labels that run from anti-Israel to anti-Jewish."
On Friday, Mr. Hoyer, the House Democratic leader, shot back. "Exploiting anti-Semitism for partisan advantage is dangerous and wrong," he said. "It is misleading on the facts, destructive to the critical bipartisan support that Israel has always enjoyed and that has been so important to its security and success, and a risk to the unity of our country."
Ms. Pipko insists she simply wants to educate people. She has "kind of said goodbye" to modeling -- "I think I'm moving past it," she said -- though given her unusual résumé and her very much active Instagram account she seems to expect that people will doubt her.
"I can't blame them," she said. "There's a lot that I've done that's very far from politics. I'm also 23 years old. I'm very O.K. with having to prove myself, and I'm excited to show people that I am very serious."
Correction: March 22, 2019, Friday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of a story on the "Jexodus" movement said Elizabeth Pipko attends the Harvard Extension School, not Harvard University. The extension school is part of the university. She does not attend Harvard College.

(There are three locations in Hollywood, Northridge and Sherman Oaks that are donating to City of Hope, another worthy cause.)

You can visit any Jersey Mike’s Subs and make a donation anytime in March.

It’s a simple truth that came to light in Bezos spectacle

Texto completo: Sometimes stories are simpler than they’re made out to be. That appears to be the case with Jeff Bezos.
When the National Enquirer reported that Bezos, the Amazon founder who is the world’s richest man, was having an extramarital affair and had sent racy texts, including photos of his penis, to his girlfriend, Bezos assembled a high-priced legal and PR team to mount an aggressive defense.
All of a sudden, sympathetic commentators began suggesting Bezos had been hacked. There was word that a "government entity" had gotten hold of the texts and photos. There was dark speculation of international intrigue, that Saudi Arabia might have used the Enquirer to target Bezos, who owns The Washington Post, in retaliation for the Post’s coverage of the murder of the columnist and Saudi regime critic Jamal Khashoggi. And of course, President Donald Trump played some sort of behind-the-scenes role.
Bezos orchestrated it all, using his security consultant to feed information to his newspaper, and also writing a much-discussed personal statement published on Medium.
"This statement that (Bezos) has released tonight is absolutely extraordinary," MSNBC’s Lawrence O’Donnell said on Feb. 7, "and I think it is a gigantic moment, actually in this history of our digital communication, which everyone has known has been at risk for quite a while, that any one of us could be hacked. We could have private things revealed through stolen emails, stolen texts, that sort of thing. And here is someone who stands up and says, I’m not going to take it anymore."
"The Saudis are being brazen," MSNBC’s Chuck Todd said on Feb. 8. "We’ve caught them being brazen with Qatar. We’ve caught them being brazen with Jamal Khashoggi. This would not surprise if it ends up being more connected to them because they’ve been acting this way."
"The Saudi connection aspect of the allegation from Jeff Bezos," said CNN’s Chris Cuomo, also on Feb. 8. "Bezos says ... that you had (National Enquirer chief David) Pecker go to the White House with a Saudi guy that he was trying to raise money from. The dinner was a reward from the president. The Khashoggi reporting that The Washington Post did would really bother the Saudis, the Saudis wound up giving Pecker the money. Pecker’s now going after Bezos, who owns The Washington Post, maybe this has something to do with the Saudis, maybe even the president."
And so on. The Bezos team spun quite a story. But holes quickly appeared in their handiwork.
In early March, The New York Times published a detailed look at how the long-married Bezos came to be involved with his girlfriend, former Los Angeles local news anchor Lauren Sanchez. As the two got together, the paper reported, a smitten Sanchez was not shy about sharing intimate details of the relationship with her friends.
"By last year, they were having an affair," the Times wrote. "Three people in Ms. Sanchez’s extended social circle said she was giddy and in love, showing amorous texts to a number of Brentwood and Beverly Hills moms."
Sanchez was, to say the least, not particularly discreet in handling the revealing texts and photos Bezos sent to her. And then there was, in the Times’ description, Sanchez’s "fame-hungry brother-manager," Michael Sanchez, described as a "loose cannon" and an "incorrigible gossip even in a town full of them."
Now, The Wall Street Journal reports that Michael Sanchez, "a talent agent who has managed television pundits and reality-show judges," has also "long been a source for the Enquirer." And, according to the paper, Michael Sanchez sold the Bezos texts to the Enquirer for $200,000.
Imagine that. Mogul sends deeply private texts to gossipy L.A. girlfriend who has gossipy, fame-hungry brother, and somehow it gets out! No Saudis required.
It is not unusual for men caught sexting with women not their wives to claim they have been hacked, or that their texts have somehow been stolen. Remember that Anthony Weiner tried the same thing. But few have the resources of Jeff Bezos, and few could rely on so many media commentators to spread the story.
At the same time, the Bezos spectacle also attracted the attention of more serious journalists, who found out that the real Bezos story is much simpler than all the Saudi speculation. It is, in fact, an old story, of people acting foolishly in the course of an extramarital affair. All the money in the world couldn’t change that.

Tennis star Williams invests in Austin’s Bumble Fund

Texto completo: Bumble is ready for the next phase of its partnership with Serena Williams, announcing Wednesday that the tennis champion will become an investor of the company’s “Bumble Fund.”
Bumble Fund, an early-stage corporate investing vehicle that launched in 2018, focuses on companies led by underrepresented women and minority founders.
“In my life, and today more than ever, I’ve learned how impactful one woman’s voice can be when given a platform to speak and be heard,” Williams said in a written statement. “By joining forces with the Bumble
Fund, we will continue amplifying female entrepreneurs and creating a place for them to personally and professionally champion their growth.”
Williams is a big get for the Austin-based company, which debuted as a dating app in 2014. The app, which requires women to message first, has since expanded to Bumble Bizz for networking and Bumble BFF for making friends. It has more than 50 million users.
Williams is one of the most successful players in the history of the Women’s Tennis Association’s professional tour, ranking second all-time in major titles and having earned more than $88 million in tournament winnings.
And the tennis star has an investment arm of her own through Serena Ventures, which she founded in 2014. Serena Ventures also focuses on underrepresented founders and has invested in more than 30 companies.
According to a news release, Williams will join Bumble CEO and founder Whitney Wolfe Herd in Bumble Fund’s pitch competition next month. The pitch competition launched Wednesday through Bumble Bizz, the networking side of the Bumble app, with a focus on underrepresented founders.
Their latest partnership comes after Bumble launched its year-long “#InHerCourt” marketing campaign with Williams. The company unveiled a 30-second TV commercial during the Super Bowl that featured Williams calling on women to make the first move in work, love and life.
“When we launched our #InHerCourt campaign with Serena Williams this past January, we were amazed by the overwhelming response we received from women globally who felt empowered by our message,” Bumble founder and CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd said in a written statement. “In teaming up with Serena for the Bumble Fund, we want women everywhere to know that we are here, we are listening and we believe in you. We are giving women more keys to success, while encouraging them to push their ideas forward and keep thinking big when it comes to their business ventures.”
Bumble Fund announced its second round of investments earlier this month.
The #InHerCourt marketing campaign is the company’s latest move to push its women-focused message.
During South by Southwest, Bumble transformed Jo’s Coffee on Austin’s Second Street into an Instagrammable Bumble hive, kicking of 10 days of festivities on International Women’s Day.
The company also hosted dinners around the country for International Women’s Day to allow women to network with “the goal of creating more space at the table” in male-dominated industries, according to Chelsea Cain Maclin, Bumble’s vice president of marketing.
And Bumble made waves in September when it took out a full-page ad in the New York Times that read: “Believe Women.” The ad published one day after Christine Blasey Ford testified against then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The company has also banned shirtless selfies and misogynistic language. The dating side of the app lets women interact only with the men they message first.
Last year, Wolfe Herd told CNBC the company’s growth is outpacing expectations and added that the company is “actively pursuing” an initial public offering of stock.
The company generates revenue using a subscription model that offers some free features and charges for additional services.

Texto completo: Digital First Media took a step forward in its hostile bid for Gannett Co., with a debt specialist indicating Digital First could raise the funds needed to pay for the $1.4 billion takeover.
Oaktree Capital Management LP, a credit-investment firm with $120 billion of assets as of December, told Digital First it is "highly confident" in Digital First's ability to attain a debt financing package of at least $1.725 billion in connection with the offer for the USA Today publisher, according to people familiar with the matter.
Digital First, officially known as MNG Enterprises Inc., offered to buy Gannett in January for $12 a share. Gannett rejected the bid and cast doubt on Digital First's ability to raise adequate funding. It also said the bid undervalued its business.
Such "highly confident" letters provide no guarantee a suitor will be able to raise the funds, but a vote of confidence by an established firm such as Oaktree could weaken Gannett's argument that Digital First won't be able to get the money.
Gannett in a statement called the letter from Oaktree "highly conditional" and said it "does not alter the company's assessment of MNG's proposal."

Digital First, which controls a roughly 7.5% Gannett stake, has launched a proxy contest in an attempt to replace six of Gannett's directors. The closely held media company owns about 200 newspapers and publications including the Denver Post and is backed by New York hedge fund Alden Global Capital LLC.
One reason Digital First hasn't managed to secure financing is that Gannett so far has refused to give it access to its confidential information, or due diligence, a person familiar with the matter said.
It isn't clear what role if any Oaktree would play should Digital First ultimately make a firm offer to buy Gannett.
Digital First's latest move comes after Gannett's board authorized the company's management and advisers to explore possible merger or acquisition scenarios with other media companies, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Gannett recently held talks with Tribune Publishing Co. about a deal to buy the publisher of nine big city dailies including the Chicago Tribune, Baltimore Sun and New York Daily News. The two companies revived merger talks following Digital First's approach to Gannett, after an earlier Gannett proposal to combine with Tribune fell apart in acrimony two years earlier.
Meanwhile, Tribune, which has been on the market since it sold the Los Angeles Times and San Diego Union-Tribune to biotechnology billionaire Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong for $500 million last year, has been exploring deals with a variety of other publishers. One possibility being explored is to revive a deal to merge Tribune with McClatchy Co., publisher of the Miami Herald and Kansas City Star, which Tribune rejected late last year over price and regulatory concerns, people familiar with the matter said.

Shootings the result of devaluing life

Información de publicación: Messenger Inquirer ; Owensboro, Ky. [Owensboro, Ky]. 20 Mar 2019.

Texto completo: Last week in New Zealand, a self-avowed white supremacist targeted two mosques and streamed his bloody killing spree on social media.
There are at least three condemnations that should result from the massacre.
The first condemnation is for the act itself. The callous slaughter of people at prayer is part of an age that has devalued life, from unrestricted abortions, to street shootings and other terrorist attacks. That some of these assaults are motivated by twisted views of religion, or in this case, a white supremacist opposed to immigration, is all part of the same piece. Murder and hate should not be categorized.
The second condemnation goes to politicians and special interest groups who blame President Trump and the NRA, seeking to make political hay out of an action that had nothing to do with either. That the shooter mentioned the president as "a symbol of white supremacy" does not make him one. Critics will use anything in an attempt to discredit and weaken Trump's appeal before next year's election. Shame on them.
The gunman, whose name shall not be mentioned here, posted a 74-page "manifesto" and details of his evil intent 24 hours before the slaughter. While more will be learned as the investigation continues, a third condemnation may eventually fall on those politicians and media people who were sent the manifesto. Did they not take it seriously, or was there too little time to respond?
Did no one see it? If someone did, why didn't they call police? If they did call, why did the police not pay him a visit? Social media is often quick to take down "inappropriate" postings. How did the gunman manage to escape censors for a heinous act far worse than offensive speech? Press reports say the shooter had also planned a terror attack on Muslims last December. Did no one hear about that? If they did, why weren't police contacted? Again, if they were, why didn't they visit the man's home?
New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern promised to strengthen her country's gun laws. Would stronger laws have deterred a man intent on mass murder? The police mainly determine who is qualified to own a gun. The New York Times reported: "While New Zealand's laws governing the purchase of semiautomatic rifles are more restrictive than those in the United States, the country is much freer with firearms than Australia is, allowing most guns to be purchased without requiring them to be tracked." The prime minister can start there.
Investigators will find how the shooter, who is a gun club member, obtained his weapons and whether he was licensed to possess them.
Meanwhile, houses of worship are finding it necessary to employ armed guards, which is a judgment on our increasingly anti-life culture. More guards will likely be hired in the aftermath of the mosque shootings.
New Zealand is the popular location for film companies. Perhaps the most famous film series produced there is "Lord of the Rings," based on the books by J.R.R. Tolkien. In "The Fellowship of the Ring," there is this quote: "Many that live deserve death. And some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them? Then do not be too eager to deal out death in judgement."
The shooter dealt death in his judgment. New Zealand no longer imposes capital punishment. If ever there was a person who deserves the death penalty, it is this shooter, and not just because it might deter others. More importantly, capital punishment imposed on this monster would exact justice for those innocent people who were killed or wounded and for their families.

Texto completo: Su familia no tiene hogar, tras llegar a Nueva York como refugiados desde Nigeria.
Pero eso no ha sido impedimento para que con apenas 8 años de edad el niño Tanitoluwa Adewumi ganara el primer lugar en el campeonato de ajedrez del estado de Nueva York sin una sóla derrota, en su grupo de edad.
“Me gusta el pensamiento profundo”, dijo Tanitoluwa a NBC News.
El estudiante de 3er grado comenzó a jugar ajedrez hace un año y según Shawn Martínez, su entrenador en P.S. 116 (Midtown East), practica el juego de mesa todos los días durante varias horas, por su cuenta.
Tanitoluwa se mudó a la ciudad de Nueva York con su familia hace dos años como refugiados de Nigeria. Sus padres temían ataques del grupo terrorista Boko Haram y por ello están buscando asilo religioso.
La familia ha estado viviendo en un refugio para personas sin hogar y sus padres dicen que allí el niño sólo puede practicar en el suelo. Pero eso no ha detenido la inquebrantable dedicación de Tanitoluwa para mejorar su destreza en el ajedrez.
Hace uno días Tanitoluwa ganó el torneo de Ajedrez Primario del estado de Nueva York en su grupo de edad y se llevó a casa un gran trofeo para demostrarlo. “Sus ojos se iluminaron”, dijo Martínez.
Después de la victoria de Tanitoluwa, Russell Makofsky, quien supervisa el programa de ajedrez en su escuela, lanzó una página en GoFundMe para ayudar a la familia a salir del refugio.
En unos días, el esfuerzo de financiación colectiva superó su objetivo de recaudar $50 mil dólares y un donante le ofreció un apartamento a la familia. Hasta anoche, más de $180 mil dólares habían sido donados por 3,400 personas, más del triple de la meta de recaudación de fondos en tres días. Y la familia estaba lista para tener por fin su propio hogar en Nueva York.
Mientras tanto, Tanitoluwa se está preparando para el campeonato nacional en mayo. “Quiero ser el gran maestro más joven del mundo”, afirmó.
Y hasta fue entrevistado por The New York Times.

Texto completo: Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox spun off various television assets -- including the Fox News Channel and Fox broadcast network -- to form a new company Tuesday known simply as Fox Corp.
The freshly minted company unveiled its board members, including former House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.). Ryan, whose two decades in Congress ended in January, forged a working relationship with President Trump to advance a conservative agenda, including tax cuts.
Now Ryan will help oversee the parent of Fox News -- Trump's favorite news network.

Fox's other board members are Murdoch; his oldest son, Lachlan Murdoch, who is also the company's chairman and chief executive; Anne Dias, founder and CEO of media investment firm Aragon Global Holdings; Chase Carey, a former Fox executive who is chairman and CEO of Formula 1 racing; Roland A. Hernandez, a former chief of Spanish-language network Telemundo; and Jacques Nasser, former head of Ford Motor Co.
The spinoff completed early Tuesday is part of a multipronged process that culminated late Tuesday with the $71.3-billion sale of the rest of Murdoch's entertainment company to Walt Disney Co.
Fox Corp. announced Tuesday morning that it had finished the process of issuing shares of itself to investors of 21st Century Fox and becoming a standalone, publicly traded company. Its shares are listed on the Nasdaq market; Tuesday was their first day of trading. The Class A shares fell 3.3% to close at $40.34.
The 88-year-old Murdoch and his family decided in 2017 to break up their entertainment empire, and Disney was the Australian mogul's preferred suitor. The Disney portion of the deal was completed late Tuesday when the Burbank giant swallowed the bulk of the Fox assets.
The new incarnation of Fox -- with headquarters in New York and Los Angeles -- is a slimmer version of the old Fox.
Its assets include Fox News Channel; Fox Business Network; two national Fox Sports channels, FS1 and FS2; the Fox Broadcasting network; and Fox's group of television stations, including KTTV Channel 11 and KCOP Channel 13 in Los Angeles.
The reconfigured Fox Corp. will emphasize live programming, with NFL prime-time games on Thursday nights and WWE's "Smackdown" on Fridays. With a growing number of viewers watching scripted dramas and comedies on a delayed basis, Fox is seeking more programs that reach consumers with greater immediacy.
The network's entertainment chief, Charlie Collier, has said Fox will remain in the scripted-TV business, taking ownership stakes in the new series it buys from outside suppliers and developing its own properties. Fox has negotiated deals with Disney to keep the network's signature animated shows "The Simpsons" and "Family Guy" and will continue to develop new series in the genre.
Fox News is also a crucial piece of the new company, as the news channel generates more than $1 billion in annual profit thanks to growth in cable and satellite subscriber fees and ratings that make it the most-watched channel behind the broadcast networks. Although some advertisers have resisted buying commercial time on the shows of Fox News' provocative conservative commentators, Madison Avenue still values the network's audience because 90% of its viewers watch live.
Fox also is holding on to the historic studio lot on Pico Boulevard in Century City, where Lachlan Murdoch, 47, is based.
The Murdoch family controls the company through its ownership of voting shares.
The spinoff comes amid high anxiety on the Fox lot in Los Angeles because of the anticipation that more than 3,000 jobs will eventually be eliminated as part of Disney's consolidation of the remaining Fox assets, two people familiar with the matter said. Most of the affected positions are in Los Angeles.
Fox alerted the employees whom it planned to retain in December. Disney has already identified key executives who will make the switch but must still decide in the coming days and months who will be integrated into the expanded company.
Disney bought the 20th Century Fox movie and television studios with their rich vault of titles, including "Modern Family," "The Simpsons," "Avatar" and "Deadpool." The goal is to ramp up a programming pipeline for a new streaming service, called Disney+, that is expected to launch this year.
Other Fox assets bought by Disney include the FX and National Geographic channels; international television assets, including Star India; and Fox's 30% stake in streaming service Hulu, which gives Disney the controlling interest in that growing business.
Disney must sell the 22 Fox regional sports networks, including the YES network in New York, which broadcasts Yankees baseball games, and Prime Ticket and Fox Sports West in Los Angeles. Disney wanted to buy the channels, but the U.S. Justice Department would not allow that. In order to gain regulatory approval of the deal, Disney agreed to divest the regional sports channels.
Disney has 90 days to sell the regional sports channels but would like to identify a buyer within a month, according to a knowledgeable person who was not authorized to comment.
Fox Corp., whose ticker is FOXA for Class A shares and FOX for Class B shares, was added to the Standard & Poor's 500 index Tuesday.
The Murdoch family still controls publishing company News Corp., which includes the Wall Street Journal, New York Post and Times of London.
The Murdochs stood to receive nearly $12 billion in cash and stock from Disney in the deal that closed Tuesday night, according to Bloomberg.

Would March Madness fans bet legally if they could?

Texto completo: The NCAA men’s basketball tourney starting this week will inspire 47 million Americans to wager $8.5 billion, Bill Miller, president and CEO of the American Gaming Association, proclaims during a Monday conference call with the media.
More money will change hands during a few weeks of the tournament than the total value of goods produced and services provided in the nation of Haiti during an entire year. Nearly twice as many people bet on the tournament known as March Madness as they do on the Super Bowl.
"Americans like to bet on sports, and Americans do bet on sports," Miller says, adding that a survey shows only 4.1 million of those gamblers place bets legally with casino sportsbooks in Nevada or the seven states (Delaware, New Jersey, Mississippi, West Virginia, New Mexico, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island) that legalized sports betting since last year’s U.S. Supreme Court ruling that makes it possible.
Anyone in Illinois or those other states without legal sports booking who plunks down 5 bucks and fills out a bracket predicting the outcomes for all 68 teams in an office pool or with friends is breaking the law, although arrests are practically nonexistent.
"Most people don’t even know the activity they are participating in is illegal," Miller says. The American Gaming Association, the gambling trade group representing casinos, pushes the idea of making gambling on sports, including contests with amateur college athletes, legal in all states. Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker has touted the idea as a way to help raise funds in Illinois, and bills to make that happen are brewing.
"Unlike any other sporting event in the country, March Madness attracts millions who fill out brackets, make casual bets with friends or wager at a legal sportsbook, which Americans can now do more than ever before," Miller says.
I first became emotionally invested in the March Madness tournament as a kid in 1969. Having played out a simulation of the final game on my driveway hoop a hundred times, I was confident my Purdue Boilermakers and superstar shooter Rick Mount were going to vanquish a UCLA team led by center Lew Alcinder. UCLA won 92-72, Alcinder went on to become the NBA’s all-time leading scorer as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Mount went on to open a hunting and fishing store in his hometown of Lebanon, Indiana, and I learned that those of us who follow our hearts instead of our heads aren’t going to do well picking winners in NCAA tournaments.
That didn’t stop me from picking an all-Hoosier Final Four whenever possible, selecting from teams such as Indiana, Purdue, Butler, Notre Dame, Indiana State and Valparaiso. That gave me a few champions (thanks, IU) in the 1980s, and some stunning upsets (thanks, Butler and Valpo), but never a complete bracket that finished in the money. When The New York Times first gave readers a chance to fill out a bracket online, my picks after Day One had me among the top 25 people in the nation. By Day Two, I had fallen out of the top 1,500.
I haven’t even bothered to fill out a bracket in recent years, which makes me a winner (or at least a non-loser).
People want to bet on March Madness, and they do it illegally if they don’t have a legal option, Miller says.
Even if Illinois legalizes sports betting through the proper channels, people might still participate in illegal office pools because it’s more fun losing money to a co-worker than to a giant gambling institution. Miller adds that the casino industry spends $300 million on "responsible gaming" programs to recognize and help people for whom gambling is a problem.
My problem with gambling today is that I did enter a free online bracket pool and my simulation has Purdue, the only team from Indiana, winning the championship game 92-72 over Michigan State.

Rupert Murdoch begins his Hollywood goodbye

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES - Thirty-four years ago, Rupert Murdoch showed up in Hollywood with $250 million, buying a stake in the 20th Century Fox film studio - even though he had little interest in making movies.
The scrappy Australian newsman, then known for his clamorous tabloids, was viewed with suspicion. Skeptics assumed he was a corporate raider intent on stripping value from the studio. Instead, Murdoch rescued a threadbare operation from financial ruin and turned it into the centerpiece of a growing empire that has reshaped the entertainment industry.
Now, Murdoch is dismantling his life's work: a kingdom worth more than $100 billion. On Tuesday, his largest company, 21st Century Fox, will be broken apart. Walt Disney Co. will absorb Fox's legendary movie and television production studios, with their deep trove of titles that include "Avatar," "Deadpool," "Family Guy" and "The Simpsons." The Murdoch family will create a new entity, simply known as Fox, that will include Fox News Channel, the Fox broadcast network, national Fox Sports channels, TV stations and the 50-acre Fox studio lot in Century City.
The sale seemed unthinkable to many. But the 88-year-old Murdoch was never enamored of the clubby movie business. He wanted the film studio to support his global push into television, where he has left a more indelible mark. Along the way, he has relished his influence and his image as an outsider, a rascal who took big swings and thumbed his nose at the establishment.
On the Fox Studios lot, Rupert Murdoch is the godfather.
A throwback to an earlier era, he's the only boss most employees can remember. Murdoch's original company, News Corp., purchased the film studio in 1985, midway through his long campaign to buy and launch properties that now span the world and touch the lives of hundreds of millions of people.
Murdoch in 2013 divided his holdings into two separate companies: News Corp., the publishing unit that includes the New York Post and Wall Street Journal; and 21st Century Fox, the entertainment arm. The Murdoch Family Trust controls both through its ownership of 39 percent of the companies' voting shares. Murdoch agreed to the corporate split to appease Wall Street, which agitated for him to sell his newspapers - something he refused to do.
He is most often associated with Fox News, the right-wing media outlet which he has helped run since Roger Ailes was forced out in 2016 in a sexual harassment scandal. But Murdoch also is a towering presence at Fox Studios in Los Angeles.
Murdoch's career began unexpectedly in 1952 upon the death of his father, a respected Australian newspaper editor. Sir Keith Murdoch controlled two newspapers, but one was sold - over Rupert's objections - to satisfy tax obligations. (His mother, Dame Elisabeth Murdoch, was 103 when she died in 2012.)
Murdoch, then 22, returned from Oxford University to run The Adelaide News, earning the nickname "boy publisher."
Soon, he was on a buying spree of newspapers around Australia as well as TV stations. In 1968, Murdoch returned to Britain and bought his first London tabloid, News of the World, and then a second, the Sun. In the '70s, he had crossed over to America, buying magazines and papers, including the New York Post, Chicago Sun-Times and the Village Voice.
He used his media outlets to amass enormous political power, and was instrumental in breaking the print unions in London in the mid-1980s. Later, he helped launch a satellite TV service, now known as Sky, to challenge the venerable BBC.
In September 1985, Murdoch's News Corp. bought Denver oilman Marvin Davis' 50 percent stake in the studio for $325 million, gaining full control.
Because he was a foreigner, Murdoch wasn't allowed to own television stations. That obstacle was expeditiously removed, also in September 1985, when he became a U.S. citizen.
His company quickly snapped up an independent TV station group and scurried to launch the fourth network, Fox Broadcasting.
With the future in mind, Murdoch concluded nearly two years ago his company would be too small to effectively compete with rising tech giants such as Netflix, Amazon and Apple. The Murdoch family will become among Disney's largest shareholders, giving them an interest in yet another major entertainment company.
The asset sale to Disney also helps alleviate a thorny issue of succession. His two sons no longer will have to share management of the enterprise. Instead, his oldest son, Lachlan, will oversee the slimmed-down Fox as its chairman and chief executive. And his younger son, James, plans to strike out on his own after two decades of working for his father.

Texto completo: When a white newspaper editor in Alabama drew widespread condemnation for an editorial that called for the Ku Klux Klan to ride again, only to be replaced by a black woman who hoped to take the newspaper in a new direction, it seemed like a symbolic moment.
The new editor and publisher, Elecia R. Dexter, said she wanted to make the newspaper, The Democrat-Reporter, more reflective of the community it serves in Linden, a small town in western Alabama that is about 59 percent white and 41 percent black.
But now, after only a few weeks, Ms. Dexter has stepped down.
Her departure this week, which she attributed to continuing interference from the editor she was meant to replace, complicates the future of the weekly newspaper, which was once hailed for its journalism, and reflects the thorny reality that healing from racially hurtful acts is rarely a once-and-done process.
"I would have liked it to turn out a different way, but it didn't," Ms. Dexter, 46, said in an interview Friday. "This is a hard one because it's sad -- so much good could have come out of this."
Her predecessor, Goodloe Sutton, came under intense criticism last month after he wrote an editorial that railed against "Democrats in the Republican Party and Democrats" and called for the return of the most infamous white supremacist group in the nation's history.
In an interview with The Montgomery Advertiser, he went even further, suggesting that the Klan "go up there and clean out D.C."
"We'll get the hemp ropes out, loop them over a tall limb and hang all of them," he told The Advertiser.
Though The Democrat-Reporter has a circulation of only a few thousand, the editorial landed with a thud at a time when the nation was reckoning with the hurt of politicians who had worn blackface and old yearbooks containing racist slurs.
Representative Terri A. Sewell, a Democrat whose congressional district includes Linden, called on Mr. Sutton to step down, and universities quickly rescinded past journalism honors given to Mr. Sutton, who had been recognized, along with his late wife, for exposing corruption in the local sheriff's department in the 1990s.
The incendiary editorial was the latest in a series of pieces in The Democrat-Reporter in recent years that were seen as racially insensitive. An editorial in May 2015 referred repeatedly to black people as "thugs." And in 2017, during the national debate over football players kneeling in protest of police brutality, the paper published an editorial titled "Let football boys kneel."
"That's what black folks were taught to do two hundred years ago, kneel before a white man," it read. "Is that it? Let them kneel!"
Amid the controversy last month, Mr. Sutton, 80, offered to hand the paper over to Ms. Dexter, who had been working there as an office clerk. Though she did not have journalism experience, she said she was excited about the opportunity to make a difference in the community.
"People have stopped by or they saw me in the store," she said last month. "Now they feel like it's going to be a true reflection of everyone."
But in the weeks since, Ms. Dexter said she ran into problems with Mr. Sutton, who retained ownership of the paper, which had been in his family for decades.
She said he emailed an altered version of the Feb. 28 issue of the paper to local news outlets and advertisers. She shared copies of both versions of the front page with The New York Times, which showed that an article about his retirement had been replaced with one defending the editorial and criticizing The Advertiser for its coverage.
The subject line of one of the emails, which were sent from a work account and which Ms. Dexter shared with The Times, read: "fake news hurts little paper."
Mr. Sutton also interfered with Thursday's issue of the paper, Ms. Dexter said in a news release, saying that the issue "does not reflect the views or thoughts" of the new editor. Ms. Dexter said she was stepping down to maintain her "integrity and well-being."
Mr. Sutton did not respond to an email or phone call requesting comment Friday. He has previously defended the K.K.K. editorial as satire meant to draw attention to corruption in Washington.
For Ms. Dexter, the whirlwind experience plunged her into a national debate about racism and entitlement -- and briefly depicted her as a symbol for change. She recalled how she received a message from a man letting her know that his biracial daughter was inspired by her role at the paper.
"It is things like that that give me peace," said Ms. Dexter, who said she was not sure what she would do next.
In the end, she said, her decision to step down was complicated by her concerns over Mr. Sutton's cognitive well-being. She said that his recent behavior was illogical and "more extreme" than it had been in the past.
"You can be mad at him, but we can't keep making this about him," she said. "People like him will exist. That's just the reality of life."
"The point," she said, "is not to give those people all the energy."

Yes, Trump is target of 'Presidential Harassment'

Texto completo: President Trump often complains that he is the victim of "presidential harassment" - or, as he sometimes puts it, "PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!"
"After more than two years of Presidential Harassment, the only things that have been proven is that Democrats and others broke the law," Trump tweeted on March 3. "Presidential Harassment by 'crazed' Democrats at the highest level in the history of our Country," he added later. "PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT! It should never be allowed to happen again!" he tweeted Feb. 7.
The president's adversaries, of course, dismiss his protests as self-interested whining. But the fact is, Trump has a point. He is the target of an extraordinary combination not just of federal law enforcement and congressional probes, but a long list of less-discussed but potentially consequential investigations by state and local prosecutors and regulators.
Together, it adds up to a pile-on of unprecedented proportions - by and large the work of blue-state Democrats who stand to gain politically if their investigations succeed in crippling the president.
Recently the New York State Department of Financial Services, the agency that regulates the insurance business, issued what The New York Times called an "expansive subpoena" to Aon, the insurance broker for the president's companies. The agency leaped into action after former Trump fixer Michael Cohen told the House that Trump had at some point inflated his assets to an insurance company. Cohen, who has pleaded guilty to lying to Congress and faces serious questions about the truthfulness of his latest testimony, supplied no details.
None were needed. "The subpoena that was served on Aon contains no indication that the company or any of its employees engaged in misconduct," the Times reported. "Nor does it specify any possible wrongdoing that is the focus of the inquiry by state regulators." The subpoena demanded "a broad range of materials" related to Trump's dealings with Aon going back a decade, the Times said.
Also in New York, the State Department of Taxation and Finance announced last October that it is investigating Trump's taxes going back at least 20 years.
Speaking of state law enforcement, the recent New York attorney general race was virtually a contest to see which candidate could vow to go after Trump the most aggressively. In her victory speech, new AG Letitia James said of Trump, "I will be shining a bright light into every dark corner of his real estate dealings, and every dealing, demanding truthfulness at every turn."
Outside of New York, the attorneys general of Maryland and the District of Columbia are suing Trump, accusing him of violating the emoluments clause of the Constitution.
Then there is the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, based in Manhattan. Prosecutors there are said to be investigating the Trump Organization's finances, the funding of the Trump inauguration, and the funding of the Trump super PAC Rebuilding America Now.
The SDNY investigations hold a large place in the hopes of Trump opponents who fear Trump-Russia special counsel Robert Mueller might deliver an underwhelming report that does not make the case that Trump colluded with Russia to fix the 2016 election or that he obstructed justice in the aftermath. Indeed, a number of observers believe the SDNY probes pose a more serious threat to Trump than Mueller.
Does there seem something odd about that? In a recent email exchange, I asked Andrew Coan, a University of Arizona law professor, who is the author of the book "Prosecuting the President," whether there is precedent for a U.S. attorney's office conducting a wide-ranging, open-ended investigation of a sitting president. "The short answer is no," Coan responded. "I am aware of no comparable prior investigation."
On Capitol Hill, Democrats have long viewed Trump's tax returns- his refusal to release them broke 40 years of precedent - as a sort of Holy Grail of Trump investigations. "We have to have the truth," Speaker Nancy Pelosi said before the election. Now, the House Ways and Means Committee is reportedly preparing to demand the Treasury Department turn over the returns. The demand is based primarily on suspicion that Trump must have done something wrong with his taxes or he would have long ago released the returns. If Democrats get the returns - and that is not guaranteed given the expected legal fight - it's likely they will start even more investigations.
Beyond that, there is the House Judiciary Committee's recent decision to demand documents from 81 people associated with Trump - a request so wide-ranging that even some Democrats worry that their party's investigators have overreached.
The point is, the scrutiny directed at the president from all sides - not oversight of his administration or even investigations into his election - so far exceeds anything in the past that it could well qualify as presidential harassment.
Democrats would no doubt respond that Trump is singularly corrupt, or that he brought it all on himself. He did not. What has happened is that Democrats, in Congress and in some key blue states, saw investigation as a way to weaken a president they never thought would be elected and want to ensure is not re-elected in 2020. And Trump, with the most extensive business history ever brought to the presidency, presented a lot of avenues of investigation. When he complains about harassment, he has a legitimate case to make.

Texto completo: In search of something to read? USA TODAY's Barbara VanDenburgh scopes out the shelves for this week's hottest new book releases.
"House on Fire" by Bonnie Kistler (Atria Books, fiction, on sale March 12) What it's about: A blended family is plunged into crisis when the son of one parent kills the daughter of the other in a drunk-driving accident. Husband and wife are torn in their loyalties – to their children and each other – as the trial date looms, and the kid's story keeps changing. A suspenseful debut rooted in family tragedy.
The buzz: "Evocative writing and wholly realized characters complement a multifaceted tale that's both harrowing and profound," says Kirkus Reviews.
"An Elegant Defense: The Extraordinary New Science of the Immune System" by Matt Richtel (William Morrow, non-fiction, on sale March 12) What it's about: Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times journalist Matt Richtel provides a deeply reported and entertainingly written exploration of the human immune system and how it works, told through the intimate stories of four lives grappling with mortality.
The buzz: "Richtel creates a hard-to-put-down account of the body's first line of defense," says Publishers Weekly.
"The Dragonfly Sea" by Yvonne Adhiambo Owuor (Knopf, fiction, on sale March 12) What it's about: On Pate Island, off the coast of Kenya, a young girl yearning for the father she never knew bonds with a sailor and soon finds herself called to the sea. With a rich and enormous cast of global characters, Owuor depicts the cultural complexities of East Africa in a stirring story of loss and discovery.
The buzz: A starred review in Publishers Weekly calls it a "sprawling, beautiful novel," an epic that "establishes Owuor as a considerable talent."
"Soldier, Sailor, Frogman, Spy, Airman, Gangster, Kill or Die: How the Allies Won on D-Day" by Giles Milton (Henry Holt, non-fiction, on sale March 12) What it's about: In time for the 75th anniversary of D-Day comes this anecdotal history of that fateful day when Allied forces landed on the beaches of Normandy. The day is narrated in a symphony of surviving voices – a teenage Allied conscript, a French resistance fighter, a butcher's daughter – placing the reader in the heat of the action.
The buzz: Kirkus Reviews calls the book a "worthy commemoration of a key historical moment."
"Too Much Is Not Enough," by Andrew Rannells (Crown, non-fiction, on sale March 12) What it's about: Actor and star of Broadway's "The Book of Mormon" and HBO's "Girls" Andrew Rannells tells the story of his life so far in a charming memoir that charts his journey from a hopeful and sexually confused Nebraska kid with big ambitions to the bright lights of New York City.
The buzz: Kirkus Reviews calls it an "inspiring and consistently witty entertainment memoir."
Actor Andrew Rannells' memoir is "Too Much."

'Kid Gloves'
By Lucy Knisley, First Second, 256 pages, $19.99

Lucy Knisley's new witty and intimate graphic memoir "Kid Gloves: Nine Months of Careful Chaos," offers the refreshingly frank, utterly un-sugar-coated account of her struggles with infertility and a high-risk pregnancy, blended with a lively and not un-disturbing exploration of the history of gynecology and reproductive health. It's packed with "plenty of drama and comedy and bodily fluids" and such under-reported facts as "about one in four pregnancies end in miscarriage." She also has just published a children's picture book, called "You Are New," depicting a whimsical array of various babies -- like the one she eventually successfully had--accompanied by such rhymes as: "You can open wide and yell. / Sometimes you make funny smells."
Born in New York City and now a resident of Chicago's West Town neighborhood, Knisley earned her bachelor of fine arts at the Art Institute of Chicago and her master of fine arts at the Center for Cartoon Studies in Hartford, Vermont. Her debut, "French Milk," came out in 2008 when she was 23, and she has been prolifically productive ever since; her second book, the food memoir, "Relish," became a New York Times best-seller, and several other charming, autobiographical image-and-text books followed in swift succession.
Knisley answered the following questions by email, just as her book tour was kicking off. The transcript has been edited for length and clarity.
Q: You describe yourself as someone who spent a "lifetime of yearning" to become a mother. Why has that always been a desire of yours, and why -- when faced with the extreme difficulty and danger of conceiving and bearing a child chronicled in your memoir -- was it so important to you to have a baby who was biologically yours rather than adopting or perhaps living a childless life?
A: Mostly I wasn't aware of the hardships I'd go through when trying to get pregnant and giving birth. My mom had an easy pregnancy with me, and I was young and healthy and didn't anticipate any problems. My doctors were all sanguine about the whole thing, and up until things went really bad at the end, I didn't ever think my life would be in danger. That said, I have always been fascinated with my body's capacity to build a human being. Pregnancy is fascinating and cool, and I wanted to do it, even just once (which is probably enough, considering).
Q: Did you know all along you were going to make a memoir about pregnancy? You write about " 'Exorcist' levels of puke," "hormonal insomnia and nightmares," and losing "about half the blood" in your body during labor. How did you decide to be so candid? What did it take not to shy away from the gross and terrifying parts?
A: I always thought it would make an interesting graphic novel, to write about pregnancy. It's a visual change and a transitional state, which I've covered in a lot of my other books. I thought it would be a pretty typical story, though. Turns out, I was right, but I hadn't known how typical it was to have so much heartache, pain and vomit, as well as a near-death experience! My eyes were opened to a lot of the things surrounding human reproduction that I had no previous concept of, and that became a much more complicated book than I'd expected.
Q: At what stage in the process did the children's book come along? What were its challenges and do you have plans to write more?
A: I've wanted to do a picture book for a long time and even have some experience illustrating books by other authors, but as someone who still worships picture books, I was always very intimidated by it. How to even begin to make something worthy of sharing a shelf with "The Snowy Day" by Ezra Jack Keats or "Ooh-La-La (Max in Love)" by Maira Kalman? Comics I know, but kids books were a new arena. Then, as so often happens, I had an idea of a story I wanted to read my kid, and it all came together from there. But it was weirdly a lot harder than writing a 300-page graphic novel! I hope I get faster eventually.
Q : You're adept at adapting your own lived experiences into memoir-comics; might you ever develop a fiction project?
A: I'm currently working on a fictional middle-grade graphic novel about step-sisters, based on my own experiences. I'm getting closer and closer to full fiction!
Q: You've said that you grew up reading comics despite your "artistic and literary parents' mild objections." Why does the comics form appeal to you as a reader and a creator? What do you hope your son will grow up reading and why?
A: I actually think my parents were responsible, if inadvertently so, for my career. My dad is a literature and writing professor, and my mom is an artist and chef. I loved reading comics as a kid, but I wanted to be a midwife for most of my childhood. When I got older, I thought I'd have to choose between being a writer or a visual artist. I found a way to combine them through comics, and it's allowed me to be both.
Q: How did your higher education -- especially here in Chicago -- impact your work, and what advice do you have for younger artists starting out?
A: I went to the School of the Art Institute to be a painter, but in my freshman year, changed my mind and wanted to make comics. At the time, there wasn't a program for it, so I had to find understanding drawing and writing professors who would allow me to experiment with making comics. I also had to compromise and learn traditional techniques in both mediums, which I think made me a better comic artist and writer in the long-term. So my advice would be to allow yourself to learn things outside of the obvious in what you want to do, because it will all serve to make you a stronger, more versatile creator.
Q: Would you describe yourself as optimistic, pessimistic or something else when it comes to the kind of future -- political, climatological -- that babies born in the early 21st century will face?
A: I have a pin that I bought a while ago that says "Cheerful Despair" (it's from The School of Life) and I love it. I think it sums up so much of being a parent and an artist and a human being. There's this constant awareness of life's fragility and the awfulness we all face, and how loving someone or something is dangerous and scary, but that we can contain that despair while being cheerful at the same time-- enjoying what we can and the pleasures in life and love and art.
Q: Any tips for soon-to-be or new parents, especially ones who live in your city of Chicago?
A: The Garfield Park Conservatory is open 365 days a year. It saved our lives in the first winter of parenthood. Go and be in a place surrounded by green plants and watch your baby look at them for the first time. Breathe in the moist air and take a funny photo of your baby next to a leaf bigger than they are.

Texto completo: One of horse racing's most celebrated tracks, Santa Anita Park in Southern California, said on Thursday that it would ban the use of drugs and whips on racing days after the death of another horse there, the 22nd since Dec. 26, an unusual spate that has puzzled investigators.
Santa Anita, a few miles east of Pasadena, Calif., would be the first racetrack in the nation to carry out such restrictions, an effort to restore public confidence in a sport that for decades has wrestled with drug and safety issues.
Track officials did not say they had pinpointed the cause of the deaths, but drugs and whips are among the factors under examination. Track conditions and colder and rainier weather than usual have also been under inspection.
It is unclear whether the new rules will apply to other racetracks owned by the Stronach Group, including Gulfstream Park in South Florida and Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, the home of the Preakness Stakes.
"What has happened at Santa Anita over the last few weeks is beyond heartbreaking," the company said in a statement. "It is unacceptable -- unacceptable to the public and, as people who deeply love horses, unacceptable to everyone at the Stronach Group and Santa Anita."
"The sport of horse racing," it continued, "is the last great sporting legacy platform to be modernized. If we expect our sport to grow for future generations, we must raise our standards."
Santa Anita, known as the Great Race Place, has held multiple Breeders' Cup World Championships and is scheduled to host the event again this year on Nov. 1 and 2. Breeders' Cup officials were not available for comment to say whether that was still the case.
The restrictions came after the death on Thursday of the filly Princess Lili B. It was the second day horses were back on the track after racing was suspended last week so authorities could re-examine it.
Princess Lili B broke both front legs while training. As is common after such injuries to horses, she was euthanized. The 22 deaths since Dec. 26 are more than the total number of deaths, 20 over 122 racing days, in 2017, according to Jockey Club data.
The track has been shut down twice this year and remains suspended for racing.
The track's policy changes came after a bill, the Horseracing Integrity Act of 2019, was introduced in Congress on Thursday by Representatives Paul Tonko, Democrat of New York, and Andy Barr, Republican of Kentucky. The bill would create a private, independent authority, the Horseracing Anti-Doping and Medication Control Authority, responsible for developing and administering a nationwide antidoping and medication control program for horse racing.
The industry has resisted such changes for decades, and Santa Anita's spike in fatalities once again put the sport's lack of meaningful oversight in the spotlight. The Stronach Group, under pressure from animal rights groups as well as horse trainers, apparently had little choice but to take drastic measures to deflect blame.
"We will wait no longer for the industry to come together as one to institute these changes," the company's statement said. "Nor will we wait for the legislation required to undertake this paradigm shift. We are taking a stand and fully recognize just how disruptive this might be."
Kathy Guillermo, a senior vice president for PETA, the animal rights group, said, "This groundbreaking plan will not bring back the 22 horses who have died recently, but it will prevent the deaths of many more and will set a new standard for racing that means less suffering for thoroughbreds."
With the Kentucky Derby less than eight weeks away, neither animal rights activists nor casual sports fans have the stomach to see a horse be put down after a catastrophic injury. Ever since the Kentucky Derby in 2008, when the filly Eight Belles had to be euthanized after finishing second, racing officials have worried that another high-profile breakdown could put the sport out of business.
In a 2012 series, The New York Times showed that 24 horses died each week at racetracks across America, many of them because of over-medication or a lack of regulatory protection. It prompted meaningful regulations across the United States that led to a decline in the death rate.
The Stronach Group has had experts survey and test the Santa Anita racetrack, but no conclusive explanation for the spike in fatalities has been offered. There are theories. Nearly 12 inches of rain have fallen since the meeting began, which has made maintaining a dirt track difficult, especially when "sealing" a track, or packing the dirt tight enough so that no water penetrates its surface. It can mean concrete footing for fragile 1,100-pound horses with ankles as slim as a Coke bottle.
The new restrictions, however, take aim at horse trainers and owners who have been among the most vocal about resisting tougher drug policies and harsher punishments. The revisions include banning the use of Lasix, a diuretic that is used to stop pulmonary bleeding but that has also been found to enhance performance, and increasing the limits on legal therapeutic anti-inflammatories, joint injections, shock wave therapy and anabolic steroids.
By banning the use of whips by jockeys, the company hopes to stanch public perception that horses are beaten to run faster.
"While we firmly believe our jockeys have not purposely been mistreating their mounts, it is time to make this change," the statement said.
The Stronach Group's statement added: "We are taking a step forward and saying, quite emphatically, that the current system is broken. While the cause of the injuries on the racetrack might be varied, they have one thing in common: The industry has yet to do everything that can be done to prevent them. That changes today."
Statistically at least, California trainers appear to be more demanding of their horses. Horses at Santa Anita currently average 3.02 workouts per start compared with 0.88 workouts per start for horses running at Gulfstream Park in Florida and 0.42 at Aqueduct in New York, according to data compiled by Equibase.
The track's new measures also call for complete transparency of all veterinary records; significantly increasing out-of-competition testing; increasing the time required for horses to be on-site before a race; and investing in diagnostic equipment for the early detection of pre-existing conditions. Also, horses in training cannot be treated with any medication in the absence of a veterinary diagnosis.

Texto completo: The pilot of the Boeing 737 Max 8 jetliner that crashed in Ethiopia and triggered a global grounding of the vaunted planes immediately noticed trouble as the plane accelerated wildly after takeoff, the New York Times reported Thursday.
Citing an unnamed person who reviewed air traffic communication from Sunday's flight, the Times said air traffic controllers knew the plane was in trouble even before the pilot radioed in that he wanted to turn the plane around within three minutes of takeoff.
“Break break, request back to home,” the captain told air traffic controllers as they scrambled to divert two other flights approaching the airport. “Request vector for landing. ”

The final moments of the ill-fated flight, in which all 157 people on board died, are considered key to the investigation into Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 to Nairobi. The investigation has even more global significance because it could have bearing on when more than hundreds of Boeing 737 Max 8 jets, now grounded amid safety concerns, are allowed to return to the skies.
Air traffic controllers at Addis Ababa’s Bole International Airport received the call from Flight 302's pilot, Yared Getachew, as the plane's speed accelerated inexplicably. The plane also oscillated up and down by hundreds of feet, the Times reported.
The sudden speed bursts, which are seen in publicly available radar tracks of the plane before it crashed, and the oscillations in altitude are two of the mysteries that investigators are studying.
Within one minute of Flight 302’s departure, the person who reviewed communications said, Captain Getachew reported a “flight control” problem in a calm voice, the Times reported. At that point, radar showed the aircraft’s altitude as being well below what is known as the minimum safe height from the ground during a climb.
The plane appeared to stabilize and climbed to a higher altitude, but then began to speed up again in a way that is deemed unsafe.
The controllers, the person said, “started wondering out loud what the flight was doing," according to the Times. The plane then sped up even more and crashed within minutes.

Investigators on Thursday cautioned that they are a long way from determining the cause, which could take months. The flight data and cockpit voice recorders arrived Thursday in Paris, where French aviation authorities were tasked with probing the black boxes for clues to the tragedy.
France’s Bureau of Enquiry and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety, or BEA, said there was no immediate information on the condition of the recorders. Preliminary information could take several days to extract, the agency said.
Sunday's crash was the second of a Boeing 737 MAX in five months. In October, Lion Air Flight 610 crashed in the Java Sea 12 minutes after takeoff from Jakarta, Indonesia. All 189 people aboard were killed.
The 371 Boeing 737 Max jets flown around the world have been grounded pending further investigation. Also hanging in the balance are orders for more than 4,500 of the hot-selling planes.
Boeing has "paused" deliveries of the 737 Max but that production continues, said spokesman Paul Bergman on Thursday.
"Boeing is facing rough waters, or rough air, in the coming months," Peter Goelz, a former managing director of the National Transportation Safety Board, told USA TODAY. "Look, you may or may not have a glitch in some sophisticated software. Some pilots were confronted with a challenge and were able to overcome it. Some were not. Why not? This is complicated. "
The Ethiopian Accident Investigation Authority sought help because of the sophisticated software involved. German aviation authorities said their technology was not designed for the new type of recorder used on the 737 Max jets.

Texto completo: Not fancified, froufrou, food-writer food. No scallops of veal or veal of scallops, no soupÃ§ons of creme anglaise or artistically arranged swirls of demiglace.

This is about the food you cook when you come home after your commute was longer than your work day, after you noticed your boss hinting about job openings you might like at other companies, when you have to take one kid to hockey practice and another to Girl Scouts and another to band practice, and you're pretty sure you only have two kids.

I asked my colleagues about their go-to foods, the food they cook when everyone is hungry and they just don't have the time or the energy or maybe even the ingredients to make their usual Tuesday night foie gras terrine.

They responded with delightful, easy-to-make ideas that tasted great. Each one, incidentally, included a starch, a source of protein and vegetables. When you're tired and hungry and pressed for time, apparently, you want the nutritional requirements for an entire meal in one dish.

Even the most exotic of the responses is simple, because it makes use of prepared items you get at the store. Tikka Masala Naan Pizzas begins with premade naan flatbreads, which you then spread with tikka masala sauce that you spoon on straight from the jar.

This dish works so well because that tikka masala sauce from a jar can be awfully good, if you like spicy food. And while the store-bought naan can't match a freshly made sample from a restaurant, it is certainly good enough for our purposes.

I added cooked chicken and sauteed mushrooms to the naan pizza (which is to say the non-pizza), topped it with shredded mozzarella cheese and added a few leaves of spinach more for visual appeal than flavor. A few minutes in a hot oven melted the cheese and browned the edges of the naan.

It was an easy-to-make Indo-Italian masterpiece.

Sticking to the Italian-ish theme, I next made Hahnilini. This is clearly the creation of a woman who has two children: It is fast, efficient and filling. It looks nice, and it tastes good, too.

Hahnilini begins with a pretty form of pasta -- bowtie, shell or fusilli (which the recipe's creator calls "scroodle noodles"). This you boil as usual, but a couple of minutes before it will be done, you add some broccoli to let it cook with the pasta.

Genius, right? You drain the pasta-'n'-broccoli and toss it with chunks of cooked chicken, garlic salt, butter and shredded Parmesan cheese.

As the recipe puts it, "serve on pasta plates, bowls or regular plates. and tell your family to be happy about it."

Next up is instant ramen with a difference. Perfect Instant Ramen takes your standard packet of ramen -- I bought one for 25 cents -- adds broccoli, poaches an egg in it and tops it with butter, scallions, sesame seeds and, um, American cheese.

The recipe is actually an adaptation of a recipe by a Los Angeles-based chef that ran in the New York Times. It's Korean comfort food, said the chef, Roy Choi; it is how he used to eat ramen when he was growing up and still loves to eat it today.

The addition made by my colleague is the broccoli. The broccoli rounds out and deepens the flavor, and provides nutrients to an environment that is otherwise as rich in sodium as it is in taste.

And finally, I made a quesadilla that is defined less by specific ingredients than whatever you happen to have left over in the fridge. That's what happens when you're pressed for time and you need a go-to dinner.

I wanted this one to be vegetarian, which is how the woman whose recipe it is often makes it. I put broccoli in mine (I had some left over from the other recipes), plus sautÃ©ed mushrooms and diced tomatoes, plus, of course, shredded cheese -- I used Colby Jack.

Texto completo: Dr. Paul Talalay, a noted molecular pharmacologist who headed a Johns Hopkins School of Medicine research team that isolated a chemical found in broccoli that helped boost its cancer-fighting abilities, died Sunday of congestive heart failure at his Roland Park Place home.
He was 95.
"He had a credible standing as a bona fide conventional scientist, and was a man of many skills," said Dr. Theresa A. Shapiro, a professor in the division of clinical pharmacology and pharmacology and molecular sciences at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, who first met Dr. Talalay when she was interviewed by him at Hopkins in 1972.
"Paul was my second intellectual father. He was a mentor to me and an extraordinarily intelligent man who was witty, charismatic and elegant. He had a deep wisdom about him which combined to make him a unique individual and a great citizen of the institution," said the Towson resident.
Dr. Phil Cole, former pharmacology department chair at Hopkins who is now professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, said: "I feel he's one of the most important scholars Hopkins has had in the last 50 years.
"His vision transformed how we view biomedical research, which led to important insights in protection from disease and maintaining health," said Dr. Cole, a Newton, Mass., resident.
Dr. Talalay, who was born in Berlin, Germany, to Soviet Jewish parents, was the son of Joseph Talalay, an engineer and inventor, and his wife, Sophie Brosterman Talalay, a homemaker.
Shortly after the rise of Adolf Hitler, Dr. Talalay and his family fled Germany in 1933 using purchased Haitian passports, family members said, moved to Belgium, France and then England, and settled near London.
He was a graduate of The Bedford School in Bedford, England, where while a student he learned to speak English.
In 1940, he immigrated to New York with his family and later settled with them in New Haven, Conn. He was a 1944 graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where he earned a degree in molecular biophysics.
He began medical school at the University of Chicago, where he conducted research in the laboratory of Nobel Prize winner Dr. Charles B. Huggins, a prostate cancer researcher, which sparked his lifelong interest in cancer.
"He taught me all that I know about science and about how to do science," Dr. Talalay told The Sun in a 1992 interview.
Dr. Talalay left Chicago after two years and entered Yale University Medical School, from which he graduated in 1948, and for the next two years, was a house officer at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.
He returned to the University of Chicago in 1950, "where his early work on the mechanism of cancer earned him a lifetime research grant from the American Cancer Society, at the time, the largest research grant the society had ever awarded to an individual," his son, Antony "Tony" Talalay, of Lutherville, wrote in a biographical profile of his father.
Three years later, he entered Cambridge University for postgraduate work, where while working in the laboratory, he met his future wife, the former Dr. Pamela Samuels, a biochemist, "and they bonded over their interest in protective enzymes," his son wrote. They married in 1953.
Dr. Talalay came to Baltimore from the University of Chicago in 1963, when he was appointed professor of pharmacology and chairman of the department of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, which later became the laboratory for molecular pharmacology at Hopkins.
"His tenure as chair of the department was legendary, according to colleagues at Hopkins and elsewhere," according to a 2009 profile of Dr. Talalay in the Johns Hopkins Magazine. "He started the Ph.D. program in pharmacology, breaking the tradition nurtured by his two predecessors who believed that a medical degree was all one needed to perform research in the field."
"As a leader, he made two crucial hires that changed Hopkins when he brought Dr. Solomon Snyder and Dr. Donald Coffey to Hopkins," Dr. Cole said.
Dr. Solomon H. Snyder was a Hopkins professor of psychiatry, neurosciences and pharmacology who discovered opiate receptors in the brain, and Dr. Donald S. Coffey, was director of research at Hopkins' Brady Urological Institute and a professor of urology.
"He also initiated the MD-PhD, medical scientist training program at Hopkins in 1975 that trained real leaders in biomedical research that have gone all over the world," Dr. Cole said.
In 1973, Dr. Talalay stepped down as department chair "when he decided to take a leap of faith away from treatment and toward preventing cancer," reported the Hopkins Magazine, to head the laboratory for molecular pharmacology.
"He worked tirelessly for more than 40 years exploring and devising strategies aimed at preventing cancer," his son wrote. "After identifying synthetic molecules that promoted the ability of cells to resist damage, his lab turned to natural compounds in cruciferous vegetables with this activity, including broccoli. This led to the launch of the Center for Chemoprotection Research at Hopkins.
The broccoli research began the early 1980s, when Dr. Talalay gave a $20 bill to one of his students and asked him to go to the Northeast Market.
It was in 1992 that Dr. Talalay and the team of his researchers that he headed isolated a chemical, sulforphane, that is found in broccoli and similar Brassica family of vegetables, which in addition to broccoli include cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, kale, turnips, collard greens, mustard greens, cabbage and kohlrabi, that can fight cancer.
"He was ahead of the curve on that," Dr. Shapiro said. "He legitimized that and the fact that it had a nutritional impact on our health."
"The lab's findings were splashed on the front page of The New York Times and hailed as one of the top 100 scientific discoveries of the 20th century of Popular Mechanics," observed the Hopkins Magazine profile. "All of which fortified a still-growing movement built, by science and so-called foodies, on the idea that people can improve their health by eating the right foods."
It was said that after Dr. Talalay's research became public, broccoli sales in the United States doubled, while President George H.W. Bush pronounced his disdain for the vegetable.
"My greatest fear is that on my tombstone, they'll say, 'He made broccoli famous,' " he told Hopkins Magazine.
In an interview with the Institute for Basic Biomedical Sciences, Dr. Talalay explained that broccoli sprouts were a regular part of his diet.
"I've gone to a better diet, a more vegetable-rich diet, since starting this research," he said. "We eat broccoli sprouts two to three times a week. I enjoy them on a croissant with a little cream cheese."
Dr. Talalay, his son and Dr. Jed Fahey, a nutritional biochemist and associate professor of medicine and of pharmacology and molecular sciences at the Hopkins Medical School, established Brassica Sprout Group LLC, which produces and sells 4-ounce packages of broccoli sprouts nationwide.
There was another side to Dr. Talalay, the bit player, who had brief walk-on roles in several John Waters films.
"He was a porn patron in 'Polyester,' a cabdriver in 'Hairspray,' and a concerned citizen in 'Cry-Baby,' " said Mr. Waters, of Guilford. "He was very eccentric and a bit of the mad doctor, and I mean that in a nice way. He was always wonderful and lovely to us."
Said Dr. Cole: "He was quick-witted and not someone to tangle with in a personal debate. He was an eloquent speaker who could move people when he told stories of his life."
Dr. Talalay was a member of Baltimore Hebrew Congregation.
The former longtime resident of Boxhill Lane in The Orchards neighborhood of North Baltimore never retired. He enjoyed spending summers at a second home in Surry, Maine, reading and woodworking.
Private services were held in New Haven on Tuesday, and plans for a memorial service to be held in Baltimore are incomplete.
In addition to his wife of 66 years and son, Dr. Talalay is survived by three daughters, Susan Mora of McLean, Va., Rachel Talalay of Vancouver, British Columbia, and Sarah Talalay of Kuala Lumpur; and four grandchildren.

Texto completo: Illustration Randy Shaw, author of "Generation Priced Out," speaks at the Boulder Book Store on Tuesday night.

Housing activist and author Randy Shaw on Tuesday night offered a searing indictment of the politics and zoning policies that he said have fueled Boulder's affordable housing crisis.
Shaw, the author of "Generation Priced Out: Who Gets to Live in the New Urban America" and founder and executive director of the San Francisco-based Tenderloin Housing Clinic, spoke about his new book at the Boulder Book Store. The book examines how "skyrocketing rents and home values are pricing the working and middle classes out of urban America."
He wrote the book in the wake of the 2016 Ghost Ship fire that killed 36 people in an Oakland warehouse. Oakland was supposed to be the affordable alternative to San Francisco, he said, and the fire prompted him to ask: What's wrong here?
The process led him to progressive cities across the country that espouse inclusion and diversity but that, he said, engage in hypocrisy in regard to their housing policies.
"(I'm trying to) explain that we have a misunderstanding of why housing costs are so high," Shaw told an audience of a several dozen Tuesday night. "They're high because we don't build enough housing. We don't build enough apartments that are more affordable. We don't build enough apartments because homeowner groups have prevented them from being built in their zoning policies."
As he found cities in which momentum increased for less restrictive zoning and more housing, Boulder became the exception, he said.
Instead, the city has embraced the outdated notion that being an environmentalist means protecting the mountains and the lakes but rejecting infill housing — it means people have to live in the suburbs and commute to their jobs, thereby contributing to greenhouse gas emissions, he said.
Homeowner groups in Boulder, as they do elsewhere, wield political power to stop development in their neighborhoods, too, he said.
"That's what you should think about: How has Boulder gone on this path of using anti-development politics as if it's somehow progressive?" he said.
He said the story of the "greedy developer" gets more attention across the country than does the systemic denial of apartments and the unwelcome attitude cities strike toward renters.
He pointed to cities like Minneapolis as a sign of progress, where in December city council voted to get rid of single-family zoning in an effort to both "address its affordable-housing crisis and confront a history of racist housing practices," according to the New York Times .
"If Boulder continues to elect people who don't support those values, then it's going to continue to become more and more of a rich, white enclave, which is the direction it's headed," Shaw said.
Mayor Suzanne Jones in an interview Wednesday acknowledged that Boulder has more work to do, but said to call Boulder anti-housing is inaccurate.
"That's provocative language that's not accurate," Jones said. "I think the spirit of what he's saying is, 'Hey, there are a lot of creative ideas out there, and maybe we should be looking at more of them.' Absolutely. That's why we have a Housing Advisory Board, and we're having those conversations about how bold we want to be."
She pointed to various initiatives, including what she described as the most aggressive permanently affordable housing program in the state, in which 20 percent of residential units built in Boulder have to be deed-restricted affordable to low and moderate income levels.
She highlighted projects the city is sponsoring, such as the 30 Pearl and Alpine-Balsam developments, which are slated to include permanently affordable housing, as well as the city's work with Boulder Housing Partners to preserve existing apartment complexes and their affordability.
Jones also discussed council initiatives to relax accessory dwelling unit standards ; examine city policy regarding so-called McMansions , in which smaller houses are demolished and replaced with bigger, more expensive homes; explore a pilot program to help middle-income workers and residents buy homes ; and invest in the city's manufactured housing communities .
"We're taking this very seriously," Jones said. "We've got a lot of different efforts ongoing, and they are adding permanently affordable units every year. We're proud of that progress, but we have a lot more work to do."
She later added: "Is there more we could do? Absolutely. Are we doing a lot? Yes."
She encouraged residents to speak up if there's more they'd like to see council do.
As for single-family zoning, she said, that would also be a community conversation.
"Whether or not we as a community want to change occupancy standards or single-family zoning is something that will have to be decided by the community," Jones said. "It's certainly one of the options that could be explored in the future."

U.S. SHOULD GROUND BOEING'S 737 MAX 8 AFTER DEADLY CRASHES

Texto completo: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration defies common sense with its refusal to ground the new model of Boeing planes involved in two similar crashes that have killed 346 people in the past five months.
Until the causes of the accidents in Ethiopia on Sunday and Indonesia in October are determined, our federal government regulators should put the safety of the flying public ahead of the financial concerns of the airline industry.
They should ground the Boeing 737 Max 8.
As of Tuesday, Europe's aviation regulator (and France, Germany, Britain and Ireland, individually), India, Australia, China, Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia had all banned the planes.
There's good reason. The two crashes both involved new aircraft in good weather just after takeoff. In each case, the pilots reported problems controlling the planes right after takeoff.
But, in the United States, the FAA insists no action is needed. In a statement Monday, the agency noted reports of similarities between the two crashes, but then added, "This investigation has just begun and to date we have not been provided data to draw any conclusions or take any actions."
That's true. It's too early in the investigation to draw conclusions either that the planes are safe or that they are dangerous. But there's enough information out there to raise serious concerns. Until the causes are known, the FAA should err on the side of caution.
Meanwhile, Boeing is sending mixed signals. On one hand, it insists the new planes are safe. But, simultaneously, the airplane manufacturer says that in coming weeks it will roll out new flight control software enhancements for the Max 8 that were developed in the aftermath of the first crash.
In other words, there's nothing wrong with our planes, but we want to fix them anyhow. That's hardly reassuring.
More than 340 Max 8 planes are already registered, racking up 8,500 flights worldwide during the week beginning Feb. 25, according to the New York Times. Thus far, at least 34 airlines have taken the plane out of service.
But the three companies with the largest fleets of the Max 8 Southwest Airlines, American Airlines and Air Canada, with 82 of the new planes between them continue to fly them.
If they insist on gambling while the causes of the two crashes remain under investigation, they should at least offer free flight changes to passengers who don't want to take the risk.
It's not surprising that profit-driven airlines don't want to ground the Max 8. But it's the FAA's response that's the most disappointing.
It reinforces the sense that the nation's airline regulators put the industry's financial well-being ahead of the flying public's safety. We raised that concern last year after a near-catastrophe at San Francisco Airport and near-misses elsewhere in the country.
Now, the stark contrast between other nations' prompt response to the Max 8 crashes and the foot-dragging by our own FAA only heightens that concern.

Pelosi puts the kibosh on impeachment: good politics or bad precedent?

Texto completo: Dear readers:
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi made news this week when she told The Washington Post that she is “not for impeachment.”
“Unless there’s something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don’t think we should go down that path, because it divides the country,” Ms. Pelosi said in an interview.
House Intelligence chairman Adam Schiff echoed that view at a Monitor breakfast yesterday, telling the assembled reporters that Ms. Pelosi is “absolutely right.”
None of this should be remotely surprising to anyone, really, because it’s basic politics. If House Democrats were to impeach the president, the Republican-controlled Senate would almost certainly vote against convicting and removing him from office.
Anyone who can remember the Clinton years knows that impeachment proceedings would push voters even further into their partisan camps – and very possibly create new sympathy and enthusiasm for Mr. Trump in quarters where it previously did not exist. Frankly, it could help him win reelection.
In other words, Ms. Pelosi doesn’t want to impeach Mr. Trump – because she wants to beat him.
“Running against Trump was a winning strategy in the 2018 midterms, which saw Democrats gain 40 House seats and a 7 percent popular vote margin with record turnout,” writes The Bulwark’s Benjamin Parker. “Pelosi would be foolish to change that formula.”
Trump supporters say Pelosi and the Democrats are trying to have it both ways – accusing the president of misdeeds, but not putting their money where their mouth is, so to speak. “They have a constitutional responsibility to act if they believe they have the evidence,” writes GOP strategist Ed Rogers in the Washington Post. “Aren’t there supposed to be mounds and mounds of evidence against Trump?” 
Likewise, some wonder if the Speaker is inadvertently setting a new standard that will make impeachment all but impossible in the future.
If House Democrats won’t impeach Mr. Trump, regardless of what special counsel Robert Mueller finds, “would that set the bar so high that impeachment will no longer be a viable option?” write the New York Times’s Peter Baker and Emily Cochrane. By saying she would need bipartisan buy-in to proceed, Ms. Pelosi essentially “leaves impeachment in the hands of the president’s own party.”

Green New Deal targets the wrong country

Texto completo: Green New Deal targets the wrong country
Unless you have been in hibernation for the winter, you have heard of the Green New Deal being floated by Sen. Ed Markey and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. It is an attempt to reduce the effects of climate change in America by radically changing how our country deals with pollutants. By coincidence, the 2018 World Air Quality report came out this week, listing the 50 most-polluted cities in the world. Here are the results, by country, and the number of worst-polluted cities in that country (with the worst listed as number 1):
India: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 29, 37, 44, 45
Pakistan: 3, 10
China: 8, 19, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50
Bangladesh: 17
Considering that 50 of the worst-polluted cities on this planet are in one region of the Earth, and zero are in America, wouldn't it be much more productive for Ocasio-Cortez and her liberal friends to sell her Green New Deal to India, China, Pakistan and Bangladesh? Let's see how far she gets with that.

Democrats only offering negative comments
Americans should, by now, be fed up with the Democrats/Socialists' unending negativity.
While our president continues to promote the general prosperity of the country by helping to develop business and industry, reducing unemployment and welfare, trying to protect our borders from illegal entry by drug dealers and other miscreants, the Democrats/Socialists have done absolutely nothing for the country. Their entire focus has been an anti-Trump bias.
When will Americans begin to accept the positive and reject the perpetual negativity in which the left is wallowing?

Assessment of attack on masculinity was written well
I would like to express my agreement with the assessment presented by Jocelynn Cordes in her Feb. 27 Town Square piece titled "Feminists Launch Misguided Attack on Masculinity."
I was struck by Cordes' balanced discussion, which stands in contrast to the recent blanket condemnation of males in both a Gillette television advertisement and the Michelle Goldberg New York Times Feb. 24 opinion piece titled "Not the Fun Kind of Feminist." The latter two, so typical of today's media, smack of moral superiority.
To Ms. Cordes, a sincere thanks for your demonstration of basic civility.

Democrats show narrowness by banning Fox News coverage
It's obvious the Democratic National Committee can't deal with differing opinions. They've excluded Fox News from hosting any of their presidential debates. Their lack of integrity is as glaring as their hypocrisy. Thanks for the extra ammunition, Democrats.

Bryce Harper won't win World Series for the Phils
It makes me laugh how all these Phillies fans think that Bryce Harper guarantees them a World Series championship. He guarantees them nothing. In baseball, pitching is what wins championships. And the Phillies don't have it.
Right now I think they are no better than third in their division behind the Mets and Washington, who have the better pitching. I can't wait for the first time that Harper strikes out with the bases loaded and gets booed off the field. That will be typical Philadelphia.

Voters and their representatives should support Green New Deal
Everyone who wishes to continue the line of humanity needs to support the Green New Deal. Up until now, we have not proposed environmental legislation at a quarter of the level of action of what we need it to be. As a young person, I am terrified for the future of our world: Climate change is something that is threatening humanity on the largest scale we have ever experienced in a crisis. We do not have time to wait for a new administration to address this: We need to act now, and act strong in the face of danger.
A Green New Deal will protect ourselves and future Americans from the catastrophic effects of climate change, as well as create millions of green jobs. Regardless of political party, this legislation makes sense.
I call upon Rep. Susan Wild and Sens. Bob Casey and Pat Toomey to pledge their support for a Green New Deal: It will make the difference between life and death for their constituents.

Democrats falsely accuse Trump supporters of racism
Well the 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls are already ramping up the rhetoric. They all spout that President Trump and his supporters are racists. Even Hillary had to get in on the racist comments at her speech in Selma last week. When will they show us a little respect?
I'm a Christian conservative President Trump supporter, and I am not racist, I don't have anything against the LGBTQ community or Muslims. I treat everyone with the same respect I expect to be treated. The constant inflammatory insults are getting old and tiring.

Texto completo: After heated debate within their caucus, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Democratic leadership released a separate statement: "Congresswoman Omar's use of anti-Semitic tropes and prejudicial accusations about Israel's supporters is deeply offensive. We condemn these remarks and we call upon Congresswoman Omar to immediately apologize for these hurtful comments."
Omar complied, but this is not the first time she's had to walk back controversial comments about Israel.
In 2012, Omar tweeted: "Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel."
The implication was that Israel and its backers are being manipulated to support the Jewish state. This old anti-Semitic trope will be familiar to anyone with a minimal understanding of the history of the Jewish people and the genocidal goal of their enemies. Yes, Omar apologized, but not until she got to Congress. This assumes her apology was more political, than sincere. Consider her appeal to "Allah." Why would she, or any Muslim, disobey Allah?
Sarah Stern, who heads Endowment for Middle East Truth, which bills itself as "a Washington, D.C.,-based think tank and policy center with an unabashedly pro-America and pro-Israel stance," emailed to say, "We Jews have learned from our long and painful history that words matter. Violence against Jews does not erupt in a vacuum; and the increasing ease with which anti-Semitic comments are uttered within certain segments of our society is deeply painful and disturbing."
You have to be taught to hate, as Oscar Hammerstein wrote in the musical "South Pacific," and hatred is at the heart of anti-Semitism, most notably in radical Islam. It can only get worse if those who harbor anti-Semitic sentiments -- like Omar and her colleague and fellow Muslim, Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) -- are elected to Congress.
According to The Daily Caller, Maher Abdel-qader, a key fundraiser for Tlaib, shared an anti-Semitic video which described Jews as "satanic."
Morton A. Klein, president of the Zionist Organization of America (ZOA), the oldest pro-Israel group in the U.S., told Mark Levin on Levin's radio show: "...the Democrat party has shown a lack of will to tell the truth of the Arab-Islamist war against Israel. In a recent BDS vote to stop BDS, boycotting Israel, the innocent Israel, half of the Democrats voted against that bill. Virtually every Republican voted for it. ...So we have a real problem with the Democratic party."
In a New York Times column last week, Bret Stephens, who is Jewish, wrote: "If Pelosi can't muster a powerful and unequivocal resolution condemning anti-Semitism, then Omar will have secured her political future and won a critical battle for the soul of the Democratic Party. At that point, the days when American Jews can live comfortably within the Democratic fold will be numbered."
I wish, but the history of Jewish loyalty to the Democrats is long, which is a mystery since in the end we are again talking about their survival, not just as a Middle East nation, but as a people.

Texto completo: Green New Deal targets the wrong country
Unless you have been in hibernation for the winter, you have heard of the Green New Deal being floated by Sen. Ed Markey and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. It is an attempt to reduce the effects of climate change in America by radically changing how our country deals with pollutants. By coincidence, the 2018 World Air Quality report came out this week, listing the 50 most-polluted cities in the world. Here are the results, by country, and the number of worst-polluted cities in that country (with the worst listed as number 1):
India: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 29, 37, 44, 45
Pakistan: 3, 10
China: 8, 19, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50
Bangladesh: 17
Considering that 50 of the worst-polluted cities on this planet are in one region of the Earth, and zero are in America, wouldn't it be much more productive for Ocasio-Cortez and her liberal friends to sell her Green New Deal to India, China, Pakistan and Bangladesh? Let's see how far she gets with that.

Democrats only offering negative comments
Americans should, by now, be fed up with the Democrats/Socialists' unending negativity.
While our president continues to promote the general prosperity of the country by helping to develop business and industry, reducing unemployment and welfare, trying to protect our borders from illegal entry by drug dealers and other miscreants, the Democrats/Socialists have done absolutely nothing for the country. Their entire focus has been an anti-Trump bias.
When will Americans begin to accept the positive and reject the perpetual negativity in which the left is wallowing?

Assessment of attack on masculinity was written well
I would like to express my agreement with the assessment presented by Jocelynn Cordes in her Feb. 27 Town Square piece titled "Feminists Launch Misguided Attack on Masculinity."
I was struck by Cordes' balanced discussion, which stands in contrast to the recent blanket condemnation of males in both a Gillette television advertisement and the Michelle Goldberg New York Times Feb. 24 opinion piece titled "Not the Fun Kind of Feminist." The latter two, so typical of today's media, smack of moral superiority.
To Ms. Cordes, a sincere thanks for your demonstration of basic civility.

Democrats show narrowness by banning Fox News coverage
It's obvious the Democratic National Committee can't deal with differing opinions. They've excluded Fox News from hosting any of their presidential debates. Their lack of integrity is as glaring as their hypocrisy. Thanks for the extra ammunition, Democrats.

Bryce Harper won't win World Series for the Phils
It makes me laugh how all these Phillies fans think that Bryce Harper guarantees them a World Series championship. He guarantees them nothing. In baseball, pitching is what wins championships. And the Phillies don't have it.
Right now I think they are no better than third in their division behind the Mets and Washington, who have the better pitching. I can't wait for the first time that Harper strikes out with the bases loaded and gets booed off the field. That will be typical Philadelphia.

Voters and their representatives should support Green New Deal
Everyone who wishes to continue the line of humanity needs to support the Green New Deal. Up until now, we have not proposed environmental legislation at a quarter of the level of action of what we need it to be. As a young person, I am terrified for the future of our world: Climate change is something that is threatening humanity on the largest scale we have ever experienced in a crisis. We do not have time to wait for a new administration to address this: We need to act now, and act strong in the face of danger.

Texto completo: Last week I received about 250 spam emails in one day. Every day I get an opportunity to date beautiful Russian girls, buy new windows or a walk-in tub. Fortunately, my email system has a spam folder into which most of this is dumped, but clean-up (so as to ensure that I don't delete wanted mail from people not in my address book) is still a burden. Some of this junk has domain names with random characters. These are one-time uses that thus cannot be blocked.
I also get "spoof" phone calls from people with faked phone numbers, many from area codes with which I am familiar. I have a Comcast home phone. That service and my Verizon cell phone do block robocalls but not the live fakers.
This sort of masquerading is easy to arrange. There are several websites that let you create spoof phone numbers and fake email addresses. A lot of this is due to the selling of my contact info by commercial sites that I have used to purchase merchandise.
Meanwhile, many of our elected officials are fishing in waters already trolled by the Mueller investigation looking for that elusive Russian collusion by the Trump campaign. And over a dozen state attorneys general have sued the administration over the "border non-crisis." However, in the past week the New York Times has carried three front page articles about how our border resources have been overwhelmed by asylum seekers.
So let these people go to work: Selling anyone's contact information should be illegal. Likewise, using fake email addresses or phone numbers by commercial or political organizations should be banned. Get with it, guys.

Don’t blame the rain for deaths at Santa Anita, the problem is much more complicated

Texto completo: It wasn’t just the stormy weather that led to the deaths of 21 horses in less than three months at Santa Anita racetrack. More likely, it was a perfect storm, one that’s been brewing for years.
The heavy rains since December contributed, certainly, but an analysis of two decades of horse racing statistics published by the California Horsing Racing Board shows the world renowned track has weathered worse with fewer fatalities.
Just two years ago, 17 inches of rain — 2 more inches than this year — fell from December to March. Eleven horses died at the Arcadia facility in that time period.
Only two of Santa Anita’s five deadliest years from 1997 to 2018 correspond with higher-than-usual rainfall. The worst year, 71 deaths in 2011-12, was during the drought.
In this case, the various factors at play include the types of horses, the track, the training and racing schedules, and the weather’s impact on each of those, said Rick Arthur, equine medical director for the California Horse Racing Board. Necropsies on the horses will also determine if the animals had any pre-existing conditions or medication in their systems.
“It’s like a plane crash,” Arthur said in an earlier interview. “There’s seldom one factor that explains everything, and I wouldn’t expect that to be the case here.”
New protocols announced
On Friday, Tim Ritvo, chief operating officer of the Stronach Group, which owns Santa Anita and several other racetracks, announced a series of new protocols to increase safety when racing resumes later this month.
Consultants are still reviewing the weather’s impact on the main track, but the initial changes extend far beyond the rainy season. Under the new rules, Santa Anita will scrutinize horses’ medical records — even during training — and control the number of horses on the track for high-speed exercises.
On Saturday, Santa Anita announced its main dirt track would reopen at 5 a.m. Monday for limited workouts — “joggers and gallopers” only.
“Over the past four days, we’ve been able to do a great deal in terms of amending the soil and inspecting it,” said Dennis Moore, who served as track superintendent at Santa Anita until Dec. 31 and recently returned to analyze the racing surfaces.
“Things can happen even under perfect circumstances,” Moore said, “but from everything we’ve been able to learn, this track is in outstanding condition and it’s ready for training.”
Santa Anita’s fixes mirror successful changes made by the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club, which cut back on horses on the track in the mornings and tightened up its inspections in the aftermath of a disastrous 2016 summer season, with 17 deaths in 23 days.
Experts: Overuse of track a factor
The increased traffic at Santa Anita is likely one of the main factors in the deaths, according to experts.
Bad weather can upset the consistency of a track, but it also forces horses into the barns, sometimes for days, according to Richard Tedesco, a veteran track consultant with experience as a superintendent at most of Southern California’s racetracks.
Disruptions make trainers and owners anxious to get their horses back out as soon as possible. Once the gates reopen, there’s a flood of horses all at once on a track already weakened by rains.
“You’ve got all of these guys foaming at the mouth to get their horse ready again,” Tedesco said. “The dirt gets pretty well chewed up.”
Too many horses running at the same time is an accident waiting to happen, he said.
Santa Anita shut its track down for two days at the end of February in response to outcry over the first 19 deaths. Track expert Mick Peterson, of the University of Kentucky’s Agricultural Equine Programs, examined and cleared the course as “100 percent ready” before the track reopened Feb. 28.
The horse racing statistics website Equibase tracked 862 workouts in the six days following the reopening. On March 1, 326 horses hit the track before the afternoon races began. Then another 70 ran in those events. The 20th horse died in a race the next day. On March 5, 273 horses worked on the track where the 21st horse died.
“That’s quite a bit,” Tedesco said of the workouts. He estimates an average day is about 150 horses.
In Europe, horses exercise at training centers and race mostly on the weekends, Tedesco said. But in Southern California, the loss of venues has condensed much of the thoroughbred racing to Santa Anita. Trainers say they don’t change locations as often as they did in the past.
Santa Anita scaled up and extended its season when Hollywood Park closed in 2013.
“The bulk of the dates went to Santa Anita,” said Jack Liebau, the director of Los Alamitos Thoroughbred Racing in Orange County. “You have a lot more stress on the track and it’s difficult.”
‘Real art form’ to maintain a track
Heavy rains, a well-worn track, and even the loss of Moore as track superintendent may have all played a part, Liebau said.
Moore, who most recently has been serving as a consultant at Del Mar and Los Alamitos, helped Del Mar with its crisis in 2016. He returned to Santa Anita as a consultant earlier this month to help with the track inspections.
“It’s a real art form to maintain a track in a safe manner,” Liebau said. “Everybody seems to be very happy that Dennis is back.”
Fewer deaths at Los Alamitos
At Los Alamitos Race Course, which runs quarter horses and thoroughbreds, 10,354 horses raced last year, compared to 8,922 at Santa Anita, according to statistics compiled from reports by the CHRB.
Los Alamitos also uses a dirt main track, like Santa Anita, and in the past three months experienced heavier rain. At both venues, the track is tightly compacted to keep out moisture. This creates another potential risk as the harder-than-expected surface can throw off a horse’s fragile footing.
Since Dec. 26, only three horses have died on the track at Los Alamitos, compared to the 21 at Santa Anita. That’s despite the fact that the state’s data shows Los Alamitos had 23 percent more deaths per year on average in the past decade.
Though the tracks share similarities, the big difference between the two venues is the daily traffic. Nine of Santa Anita’s 21 deaths occurred during training on the dirt track, seven were during races. The other five happened on the venue’s storied turf track.
Los Alamitos has added more thoroughbred racing in recent years, but the majority of horses at the venue are quarter horses. These sprinters of the racing world have less intensive training regimens than thoroughbreds, Santa Anita’s bread and butter.
Los Alamitos had less than 200 workouts in the same six day period as Santa Anita’s 862, according to Equibase.
‘Everybody worried’
Last week, the New York Times reported that trainers at Santa Anita appear to be more demanding than counterparts elsewhere in the state. Santa Anita averages 3.02 workouts per start, compared with 0.88 workouts per start for horses running at Gulfstream Park in Florida and 0.42 at Aqueduct in New York.
“Ninety-nine percent of the trainers take very good care of their horses, there’s less than 1 percent that you have to watch,” said Tedesco, the track consultant. “Owners spend a lot of money, the trainers want to win races. It all comes down to, ‘Let’s keep them going.’ “
Everyone at the track is working to ensure safety of horses during training and the races, he said. Tedesco said he’s fielded concerned calls from racetrack officials across the country..
“What is going on is really bad for the industry,” he said. “It’s gotten everybody worried, everywhere.”

Texto completo: Glenn Ellis is a Research Bioethics Fellow at Harvard Medical School, and a health columnist and radio commentator who lectures, nationally and internationally on health-related topics
Women, especially women of color and poor women, tend to suffer disproportionately in our healthcare system. The problem is growing worse now that there’s a group of trial lawyers eager to exploit female victims, under the guise of offering help.
Take for instance that roughly one-quarter of U.S. women suffer from pelvic floor disorders, and according to the Washington Post, about 3-4 million of them have been treated with transvaginal mesh. The vast majority of these women receive repairs using transvaginal mesh without complications, but a significant minority experienced serious problems.
After the publicity surrounding this issue hit the fan, the lawyers pounced. It has come to light that a collaboration involving some law firms, doctors, and finance companies are pressuring women into unnecessary surgeries to remove the mesh. Giving new meaning to the term “insult to injury,” this phenomenon, according to the New York Times, is leading unsuspecting women to the operating table – even in cases when the removal could worsen the symptoms.
If that’s not enough, some unscrupulous hedge funds are financing companies connected with law firms specializing in suing manufacturers of the mesh. These law firms often use overseas telemarketing callers in countries such as India and the Philippines to contact women, known to have had the mesh surgery, with offers to join in lawsuits to sue the mesh manufacturers.
The New York Times highlighted a growing problem that tends to target women: the industry grown out of medical device settlements. For example, a court-ordered, charitable fund, the Common Benefit Trust, established out of the Dow Corning breast implant settlement fund, which also resulted from a faulty medical device. The Common Benefit Trust appears to have used some of this money to fund policy centers, advocacy groups, and a conference on litigation.
Pelvic organ prolapse, a medical issue sought to be treated by the transvaginal mesh, is one of the most common reasons for women to have surgery. It is ranked among the top three reasons that women have hysterectomies.
Then there are racial disparities. Compared with African-American women, Latina and White women had four to five times higher risk of symptomatic prolapse, thought to be in large part due to the lower rates of African-American women reporting the condition as a problem to doctors. Researchers see this pattern as part of a culture where African-American and/or poor women will not typically see the condition as a problem requiring them to consider surgery.
Issues like the transvaginal mesh that has revealed disparate treatment of women are not new. All patients–but especially women patients and minority patients that have traditionally been marginalized–deserve better than to be exploited in some of their most vulnerable times.
Those vulnerable times include childbirth and other areas of maternal health. Dr. Niva Lubin-Johnson, president of the National Medical Association, which represents more than 50,000 African-American physicians on issues of health disparities and justice, says, “There is a crisis for African-American women that is related to maternal mortalities –and that’s across any economic level and educational level for African-American women. We are losing in that area,” she says.
As for the transvaginal mesh, Lubin-Johnson says women must take extreme precaution when contacted by anyone about removals of that or any other device. “No, you go talk to your own physician about that and not to someone who is doing a cold call because of some possibility of joining a law suit…Talk to your own physician first; even if they were not the one who put the mesh in.”
Since The New York Times began shining a light on these bad behaviors, federal prosecutors from the Eastern District of New York have begun investigating the allegations of unnecessary and unneeded vaginal mesh removal surgeries. According to reports, doctors, lawyers, financiers and others who may have been involved in the sham have been subpoenaed.
So, if you’re considering medical treatment, be an informed consumer. Be sure to have your health care provider explain all of your options, as well as their possible risks and benefits. Though if these risks are not avoided, by all means, beware of financial lures to have surgeries that you do not need and that could leave you in a condition far worse than before.

Texto completo: Can we protect children from abusers - and Momo? News of a fresh threat to children exploded on social media last week. Local TV stations, police departments and school officials began warning parents about Momo, a grinning, bug-eyed monster said to appear unexpectedly in children's YouTube videos and instruct young viewers to engage in increasingly dangerous behavior - including self-harm and suicide.
There's no proof that Momo-spliced videos for children exist, or that the figure is linked to any cases of self-harm or suicide. The photograph that warnings label as Momo actually depicts a spooky sculpture created by a Japanese artist and exhibited in a 2016 art show. (The artist who made Momo has confirmed that the sculpture was destroyed some time ago after its rubber components began to degrade.)
But despite all signs of the phenomenon being a hoax, fear of Momo persists. In the New York Times, John Herrman observed that "screens and screen time are a source of endless guilt and frustration among parents today, and it makes sense to need to displace these feelings on a face, a character, and something, or someone, with fantastically evil motives." Momo likely is a convenient repository for the terror of contemporary parenting - but I suspect there's something more timeless there, too.
Consider the context in which Momo has risen to prominence. At the moment, you can peruse a trifecta of new documentaries examining horrors committed against children: "Leaving Neverland," which explores the pedophilia allegations leveled against Michael Jackson; "Surviving R. Kelly," a deep dive into the rap star's alleged sexual abuse of young black girls; and "Abducted in Plain Sight," about an ordinary family's slow recognition of the years-long molestation of their daughter. Meanwhile, the Catholic Church has continued its very public, long-running reckoning with clergy sexual abuse.
What all of these cases share is parents' excruciating realization that they somehow delivered their children into danger - or failed to protect them. Onlookers tend to charge parents in these situations with stupidity, negligence or even malice after the fact. But the idea that abuse could never happen to smart, vigilant, loving parents simply isn't true.
One of the great anxieties of parenting - which no level of vigilance can fully allay - is that you will do everything you can to keep your child safe but ultimately fail to recognize a threat for what it is, or - worse - even invite it in. Harmful things can come in harmless guises, after all: beloved pop stars, trusted family friends, unassuming priests and perhaps cheerful YouTube videos marked for kids.
You can drive yourself crazy worrying about these hidden risks. But, ultimately, all you can do is what you're most likely already doing: Look closely, consider carefully, talk to your kids, and be cautiously optimistic. There is, finally, quite a bit of good in the world - even in strangers, even on YouTube - and not as much bad as it often seems.

Texto completo: Last year's live-action Winnie the Pooh movie hits Netflix. And Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy are buddy cops in "The Heat," on FX.
What's Streaming
CHRISTOPHER ROBIN (2018) Stream on Netflix; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. The adult world is a soul-crushing trap in this live-action Winnie the Pooh tale, with Ewan McGregor as an adult Christopher Robin. It's postwar Britain, and Christopher's imagination has been flattened by the gears of professional life and World War II. After a particularly cruel work task forces him to miss a family outing, Christopher (or Mr. Robin, if you like) has a run-in with Pooh (voiced by Jim Cummings). That soft-spoken, honey-loving bear will remind many viewers of their childhoods, and that's certainly the case with Christopher; he soon finds himself on an adventure that eventually involves the rest of the motley Hundred Acre Wood crew. In his review for The New York Times, Ben Kenigsberg wrote that once the movie "softens its insufferable, needlessly cynical conception of the title character, it offers more or less what a Pooh reboot should: a lot of nostalgia, a bit of humor (Brad Garrett's vocal deadpanning as Eeyore is a standout) and tactile computer animation that, even for the effects-jaded, makes it look as if the actors are interacting with real stuffed animals."
MY FRIEND DAHMER (2017) Stream on HBO platforms; Buy on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. For a less charmed childhood, see Marc Meyers's biographical drama about the early years of the serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer. Adapted from a memoir in graphic novel form by Derf Backderf, the film paints a visceral portrait of a killer coming of age in the mid-70s, with Ross Lynch as a high-school-aged Dahmer who joins a band of misfit nerds and leads them in mischievous acts. The "acting is excellent throughout," Glenn Kenny wrote in his review for The Times, "and Ross Lynch in the role of Dahmer elicits genuine sympathy for an increasingly lost but not yet monstrous soul."
INSPIRE THE NIGHT Stream on Red Bull TV. A workshop for female and L.G.B.T.Q. D.J.'s in Shanghai is the focus of the latest episode of this series, which explores night life worldwide. Other episodes, also available to stream, have covered the Brooklyn alternative late-night dance space House of Yes and a radically inclusive party collective in Brazil.
What's on TV
THE HEAT (2013) 5:30 p.m. on FX. Two mismatched cops with conflicting personalities? A high-stakes mission that brings them together? If you're thinking "Lethal Weapon" or "Rush Hour," you're right. But that's also the setup for this movie, which features two women -- Sandra Bullock as an F.B.I. agent and Melissa McCarthy as a hothead detective -- having fun with the oft-too-male buddy cop genre.
NBC NIGHTLY NEWS WITH LESTER HOLT 6:30 p.m. on NBC. In Wednesday's edition of this news program, the investigative journalist Cynthia McFadden will report on the humanitarian crisis in the Central African Republic.

Texto completo: Michael J. Fox, who was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 1991, underwent spinal surgery last year to correct a recent health scare that led to his falling down "a lot."
Fox, speaking to The New York Times Magazine, addressed his new health issues. He admitted that after the surgery, he tried to rush the recovery process and ended up falling again and breaking his arm.
"I was having this recurring problem with my spinal cord," the 57-year-old actor told the publication. "I was told it was benign but if it stayed static, I would have diminished feeling in my legs and difficulty moving. Then all of a sudden I started falling a lot. It was getting ridiculous. I was trying to parse what was the Parkinson's and what was the spinal thing. But it came to the point where it was probably necessary to have surgery."
The surgery in April was followed by "an intense amount of physical therapy."
"I did it all," he said, "and eventually people asked me to do some acting. Last August I was supposed to go to work. I woke up, walked into the kitchen to get breakfast, misstepped and I went down. I fractured the hell out of my arm. I ended up getting 19 pins and a plate. It was such a blow."
Fox said he might have pushed himself too hard. "In my case, what was it that made me skip down the hallway to the kitchen thinking I was fine when I'd been in a wheelchair six months earlier? It's because I had certain optimistic expectations of myself, and I'd had results to bear out those expectations, but I'd had failures, too. And I hadn't given the failures equal weight," he said.
Fox didn't reveal he had Parkinson's until 1998, seven years after the initial diagnosis. The "Back to the Future" and "Family Ties" star continued to act during that time. In 2000, he founded the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research, which has since raised $800 million to fund its work.
"I still believe in a cure," he said.

George Will: Might the Democratic push for reparations benefit Trump?

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Tiptoeing along the edge of caricature, Sen. Elizabeth Warren says: Native Americans should be "at the table" with African-Americans for a "robust discussion" about making some Americans pay reparations to other Americans to atone for misdeeds by still other Americans. The enumeration of the misdeeds, and the assignment of guilt for them, will presumably come later. What is, however, already clear is that the Massachusetts Democrat is going to need a large table.
If reparations are owed to the descendants of all members of minority groups that experienced protracted discrimination, the Irish can apply, citing the widespread practice of employers posting admonitions that "Irish need not apply." Italians, too: An 1895 advertisement seeking labor to build a New York reservoir said whites would be paid $1.30 to $1.50 per day, "colored" workers $1.25 to $1.40 and Italians $1.15 to $1.25. Asians on the West Coast were subject to severe discrimination and violence. And Jews were restricted from acquiring the momentum that elite universities impart on the path to wealth.
Native Americans and African-Americans experienced uniquely severe injustices. However, there must be some statute of limitations to close the books on attempts to assign guilt across many generations to many categories of offenders (racial, ethnic, class). How does one compute the compensation that can justly be extracted from persons who, although they participate today in the national prosperity to which slaves involuntarily made substantial contributions, had no participation in the injustices inflicted?
It is also true that the nation as a whole was injured by the exclusion of African-Americans' talents from American dynamism, both before and after hundreds of thousands of white Union soldiers were killed or maimed — should their descendants be exempted from paying reparations? — in the Civil War that ended slavery. But, then, semi-slavery survived for almost a century in Jim Crow laws after the end of Reconstruction.
If, however, you doubt that American discord can become much worse, try launching a scramble among racial and ethnic constituencies to assign varying degrees of guilt to others for varying degrees of injuries. Should reparations be means-tested, making affluent African-Americans ineligible? To avoid using moral micrometers to measure guilt and injuries, should lump sums (taken from whom? by what mechanism?) be awarded to groups? Does it matter that 3.1 million African-Americans identify themselves as of mixed race? Or that in the 2010 census, 1.8 million people self-identified as both white and black? Who would administer reparations? And at what cost to social harmony? Racial preferences ("affirmative action") remain broadly unpopular after more than 50 years (the Philadelphia Plan to integrate building-construction unions began in 1967).
And which African-Americans shall count when counting for purposes of reparations? In 2005, The New York Times reported that since 1990, the average annual flow of immigrants from Africa — about 50,000 — had been more than came in chains in any of the peak years of the trans-Atlantic slave trade.
There have been instances when reparations could be precisely targeted to defined cohorts that suffered clearly identifiable injuries. Consider an American infamy recounted in William K. Klingaman's "The Darkest Year: The American Home Front, 1941-1942." In 1942, U.S. Attorney General Francis Biddle and Secretary of War Henry Stimson said "there has been no substantial evidence of sabotage" by people of Japanese extraction living on America's West Coast. But California Attorney General Earl Warren said the "very absence of sabotage" was "the most ominous sign in the whole situation": "I believe we are just being lulled into a false sense of security." So, 120,000 American residents of Japanese descent — a majority of them U.S. citizens — were interned in camps. In 1988, each living survivor was promised a paltry $20,000 in compensation. Two more zeros would have been appropriate.
But today's flippant talk about reparations illustrates a worsening pattern of behavior among congressional Democrats, including presidential candidates. (California Sen. Kamala Harris and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro also express vague openness to reparations.) A quarter-baked idea (reparations, a Green New Deal, Medicare-for-all) is floated. There is a stampede to endorse it before thinking about the idea's dependence on enormous revenues of unknown origin and/or unavailable technologies. Then, when details, or the lack thereof, reveal the idea's wild impracticality, the stampeders breezily say: Nevertheless, the idea is virtuous because it is "aspirational." Which means that the Democratic Party is again assisting, as in 2016, Donald Trump's electoral aspirations.

Texto completo: Not ready for prime time. That was the consensus reaction to the Green New Deal, released last month by freshman Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.
The Economist called the proposal “deeply unserious.” A Washington Post editorial labeled it as “fantasy.” New York Times columnist David Brooks wrote that it would result in “the greatest centralization of power in the hands of the Washington elite in our history.”
But the Green New Deal isn’t just lousy policy. It’s incredibly hypocritical.
In boosting the plan, for instance, Ocasio-Cortez tweeted that “the world will end in 12 years if we don’t address climate change.” It was a hyperbolic summary of an alarmist and scientifically unsound United Nations report on greenhouse gas emissions.
Enter, the hypocrisy.
If a climate change-induced existential crisis were, indeed, just around the corner, the most rationale response would be to gin up all the nuclear power the world can get. After all, in 2017 nuclear provided more than half (56 percent) of the country’s emissions-free electricity — more than triple the amount we get from wind and 18 times more than solar generates generation.
But, according to the now-deleted FAQ sheet from Ocasio-Cortez’s office, “The Green New Deal makes new fossil fuel infrastructure or nuclear plants unnecessary.” Launching “a massive mobilization of all our resources into renewable energies,” while eliminating emissions-free nuclear power is the most inefficient and expensive approach to carbon reduction possible.
The hypocrisy doesn’t end there.
Green New Dealers are trying to sell their policies in the name of economic security and justice. However, policies that take away affordable, reliable power from American families are highly regressive. Higher energy costs hit low-income households hardest, because they spend a higher percentage of their budget on energy. The higher these costs climb, the more they are forced to make difficult choices between keeping the heat on or providing food for their family or perhaps going to the doctor.
Higher energy prices mean more than just having less money available for other necessities. It means having to spend more for all of the goods and services you purchase. That’s because energy is a critical component of manufacturing, communications and transportation—all of which are involved in getting goods and services to your household.
The Green New Deal doesn’t lead to more economic security and justice. It leads to greater economic strain, with low-income families being stressed the most.
And where’s the justice in cronyism and corporate welfare. The Green New Deal would open the floodgates of both.
Ocasio-Cortez rightly blasted New York’s special tax breaks for Amazon’s proposed HQ2. Offering up billions in state and city special tax breaks left a sour taste in many peoples’ mouths.
Cronyism works for big companies because they can offer a lot: investment, jobs and prosperity. But it is not a strategy for long-term economic success because it comes at the expense of other investments and opportunities. The investments will come when there’s an attractive, level-playing field for all companies to compete.
The Green New Deal would introduce significantly higher level of cronyism because Ocasio-Cortez wants the federal government (i.e., American taxpayers) to pay for the whole thing.
Remember Solyndra, the half-billion dollar solar boondoggle that went belly up? That’s just a small taste of things to come under a Green New Deal that puts potentially trillions of dollars up for grabs. As was the case with Solyndra, when the feds start picking energy technologies and companies to fund, they are essentially gambling with other peoples’ money. And there is never a guarantee the bet will pay off.
Solyndra is merely one example of a failed company that could not survive even with the federal government’s help. And there are many other examples of green cronyism that even more closely parallel New York’s erstwhile deal with Amazon, which Ocasio-Cortez found so distasteful. Taxpayers gave money or government-backed loans to companies that already enjoyed large market capitalization and/or substantial private investors. Federal “investment” wasn’t needed. But, hey, who’s gonna turn down free money?
The economic pain of green cronyism cuts deeper than wasted taxpayer money. When Washington steers money to — or away from — “favored” businesses or technologies, private-sector investment follow. This not only stifles competition and innovation, it also centralizes control in the hands of politicians, elites and lobbyists.
That’s the big picture. But the Green New Deal has very personal ramifications as well. It would change the way you live your life — from what car you drive, to how cool or warm you you’re your home, to what you eat.
The stench of hypocrisy makes it all that much worse.

Texto completo: Ryan Adams's planned tour of Britain and Ireland, due to start March 30 in Dublin, has been canceled, two weeks after allegations of sexual misconduct against the singer-songwriter emerged.
On Friday, SJM Concerts, the tour's promoter, issued a statement saying the tour had been canceled and that full refunds would be issued to ticket holders by Monday.
On Feb. 13, The New York Times reported allegations that Mr. Adams had repeatedly manipulated and harassed women in the music industry, offering to jump-start their careers only to pursue them sexually and in some cases retaliate if they spurned him.
[Read The New York Times report here.]
The F.B.I. began an investigation into one of the allegations: that Mr. Adams exchanged sexually explicit images with an underage teenager.
Mr. Adams has denied the characterizations of his behavior as abusive or manipulative and challenged the accuracy of The Times' reporting, though he apologized on Twitter "to anyone I have ever hurt, however unintentionally." Mr. Adams has also denied he has ever engaged in sexual communications with someone he knew was underage.
The allegations led to a rapid response in the United States: Mr. Adams's next album, "Big Colors," was put on hold indefinitely. Two musical equipment companies that worked with the singer also suspended their relationships with Mr. Adams. Several musicians who had worked with him spoke out in support of the women who made the accusations.
But uncertainty had remained over Mr. Adams's tour of Britain and Ireland despite fans calling for refunds online and in the British media. One fan who paid more than $200 to attend "Ryan's pinball lair experience" at a concert, a form of V.I.P. package, told The Guardian that she had felt "physically sick" after reading the allegations in The Times. "I don't want to support such a person," she added.
Despite the pressure, SJM Concerts did not respond to media requests about the tour' until Friday.
Earlier this week, it appeared that the tour would go on. On Tuesday, a spokesman for London's Royal Albert Hall, which was to host two concerts, said in an email that SJM Concerts had advised them the concerts were happening.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: Wash. governor focusing 2020 bid on 'most urgent challenge of our time'
Washington Gov. Jay Inslee on Friday became the latest Democrat to launch a 2020 presidential bid, asserting that he is the only candidate who will make combating climate change the nation's top priority.
"Whether we shrink to this challenge or rise to it is the vital question of our time," Inslee said at an event staged at a solar installation company in Seattle. "We have one chance to defeat climate change, and it is right now. It is my belief when you have one chance in life, you take it."
As he did in a video released earlier in the day announcing his candidacy, Inslee made it clear that his bid would be built largely around a single issue that he called "the most urgent challenge of our time."
In his remarks, Inslee argued that fighting climate change is central to progress on an array of other fronts, including health care, national security and racial justice.
Minorities, he said, are disproportionately affected by climate change in part because they are more likely to live near pollution-spewing plants.
"I am running for president because, unlike the man in the White House, I believe in all the people who make up America," Inslee said in one of several barbs directed at President Trump.
Inslee, 68, is the first governor to enter the crowded Democratic contest and has the longest political résumé of anyone in the race.
In 1992, after two terms as a state legislator, he was elected to represent a largely rural, Republican-leaning congressional district in central Washington. In Congress, Inslee attracted national attention by voting for the 1994 assault-weapons ban, immediately making him a target for the GOP.
"People are fed up with crime and want something done to protect them and their children from violence," Inslee told reporters at the time, standing by his vote.
Inslee lost in that year's Republican wave, but he mounted a comeback, winning in a neighboring district four years later. One of the most potent attack ads run against him portrayed a fictional call from President Bill Clinton, thanking Inslee for being so loyal; in 1998, Inslee ran his own version of that ad, with a Newt Gingrich impersonator thanking the Republican incumbent for helping him impeach the president.
Back in Congress, Inslee was a reliable liberal vote and a member of the center-left New Democrats. He focused mostly on climate and environmental issues; in 2007 he published "Apollo's Fire: Igniting America's Clean Energy Economy," a book about ways to transition the country from dependence on fossil fuels to renewable energy.
He also kept one eye on Washington, running for governor in 2012 and winning a narrow victory over a popular Republican attorney general. Inslee spent his first term presiding over a divided state government, cutting budget deals with a Republican state Senate and instating a moratorium on the state's death penalty.
Inslee was comfortably reelected in 2016 and joined the loud resistance to Trump, bringing the state into lawsuits to stop a ban on refugees and immigrants from some Muslim-majority countries. But Inslee's time in Olympia entered a new phase in 2018, after a special Senate election gave Democrats full control of the state government.
"It will be a bell in the night, showing hope for the country," Inslee told the New York Times on the eve of that election.
The governor made good on that bravado, reviving a number of ambitious bills that Republicans had blocked and capping it all with a push for a carbon tax.
During his remarks in Seattle on Friday, Inslee cited a number of his accomplishments and suggested they should be replicated on the national level, including raising the minimum wage, investing in infrastructure, abolishing the death penalty and legalizing marijuana.
"It's about time we do it nationwide," he said of the latter measure.
Inslee will have to overcome a few major hurdles as he begins his run. Despite spending more than two decades in elected office in Washington state, he lacks the national name recognition of several of his would-be opponents.
And despite his calls for drastic action to combat climate change, Inslee's most ambitious climate initiative - the institution of a tax on carbon emissions - was voted down in the state's November elections amid massive opposition spending from oil companies.
In response, Inslee introduced a new batch of legislation, calling it "a clean energy smart deal," that he says would stop the state's utilities from relying on fossil-fuel power by 2045.
During his remarks Friday, Inslee decried the influence of fossil-fuel industries on politics and vowed that if he is elected president, "that gravy train is over."
To capture the nomination, Inslee would also have to overcome some tension within his party in one of the earliest-voting states.
Inslee was chairman of the Democratic Governors Association in 2018, and New Hampshire Democrats felt that he did not direct enough support to their gubernatorial candidate, Molly Kelly, who lost to incumbent Republican Chris Sununu.
In an interview with a local radio station, New Hampshire Democratic Party Chairman Raymond Buckley said Inslee "abandoned" the state in the 2018 election.

TRENDSETTER BILLY PORTER SETS SOCIAL MEDIA ABUZZ WITH RED-CARPET STUNNER RED-CARPET STUNNER IS TALK OF THE TOWN

Texto completo: Billy Porter's velvet tuxedo ballgown, a gender-bending sensation on Oscars' red carpet Sunday, was packed away by Monday and shipped back to Christian Siriano. Its fate is in the designer's hands, but Pittsburgh native Porter had already made his stunning statement on one of fashion's biggest stages and at an Academy Awards that attracted nearly 30 million viewers.
Mr. Porter, the Tony- and Grammy-winning star of "Kinky Boots," also was sending back a second, more streamlined Siriano look that he wore as an interviewer for the ABC network's preshow, chatting up nominees such as Glenn Close - who noted their Broadway kinship - and Spike Lee. After his red-carpet triumph, Mr. Porter was packing up his own suitcases, for a Tahiti vacation, before he begins filming the second season of the FX television series "Pose," which earned him a Golden Globes nomination.
It was his fashion statement, though, that was making headlines and creating a social-media frenzy long after the Oscars ended Sunday night. "Billy Porter's Oscars Gown Is One of the Night's Biggest Hits," declared People.com. "Billy Porter's Tux-Gown Gave The Oscars 2019 Its First Viral Moment," declared Esquire.
It's overwhelming, but that's the good part," Mr. Porter said on Monday evening. "The other part is, a man in a dress still causes this much of a stir. I just put on a dress - an amazing dress - but it's still just a man in a dress."
He first saw the gown on Friday and was so excited, there was almost a wardrobe malfunction. "I forgot to even try it on with the shirt and tie - the masculine with the feminine, you know. My husband had to remind me. It was just so stunning - Christian made that in a week and two days, you know."
The designer's team worked overtime to make two velvet looks. The first was the showstopper, with a traditional bow tie, crisp white shirt and notch-collar jacket from the neck to the waist, where it transitioned into a ballgown skirt. The second was a suit with palazzo pants that wasn't quite as scene-stealing and was easier to maneuver during on-air interviews with Oscar nominees such as Glenn Close and Spike Lee.
Both looks "played on the concept of what's masculine, what's feminine," said Sam Ratelle, the stylist who also runs "anything that's visual or digital" for Mr. Porter. To anyone who wondered, "Can we have both energies in one day?" Billy Porter in a tuxedo gown was the resounding answer, "Yes."
The actor had been talking with the media most of the day and was two hours from leaving for vacation with his husband, Adam Smith, when he was on the phone to Pittsburgh. He said another "good part" of his red-carpet ride are stories he has been hearing about how his choices have inspired others to be true to themselves.
"I've been hearing the stories for a long time, but this is different," he said of the Oscars moment.
The march through awards season began to snowball after Mr. Porter wore a stunning caped outfit by designer Randi Rahm to the Globes in January. The "Pose" star had been named to serve as men's ambassador to New York Fashion Week by the Council of Fashion Designers of America earlier this month and discovered soon after that he had the ABC gig.
"Thankfully, we were going into fashion week knowing about the Oscars, and we could look at every designer, build relationships and nurture the relationships we already had and really try to figure out what from that season we could use. It literally happened within a week," Mr. Ratelle said.
Early on, they attended the Palomo Spain show that featured "looks that were very gender neutral. The boys were walking down the runway very coquettish with ruffles and feathers and opera gloves."
The stylist recalled Mr. Porter telling him, "This is crazy. I can't believe that after 30 years of me wanting to do this, I'm here for the first time, and it's OK all of a sudden."
"We are in a different space in the world and in the culture at large," Mr. Porter said Monday. "It's a different day and a new conversation - we can be whoever we want to be and stand in the power of that and in that truth."
It was at designer Tom Ford's show, as dresses strutted down the runway, that he told his stylist, "I feel like I need to wear a gown." Christian Siriano's dramatic collection sealed the deal, and the designer didn't disappoint.
On an Oscars red carpet where gender-neutral outfits were worn by "Eighth Grade" star Elsie Fisher and "Black Panther" star Chadwick Bosman - who rocked wide-legged black pants with a sequined train - Billy Porter's gown was the hottest topic on social media and Monday morning talk shows.
The intense spotlight isn't just about his fashion sense. Mr. Ratelle spoke of Mr. Porter's activism for the LBGTQ community, saying that fashion can be empowering and "a way through art to change people's minds and hearts and allow them to look at things differently - especially for a community that's been marginalized like the trans community and people who are gender nonconforming."
Mr. Ratelle has been working with Mr. Porter for a year and was part of the triumphant Golden Globes night when Mr. Porter made headlines in the bejeweled gray suit and matching pink-lined cape. That, too, was packed up and "went to whatever the version of the Met Gala in London is," Mr. Ratelle said.
Upcoming for Mr. Porter is returning to the set of "Pose" on March 27, when he begins filming season two, and a growing list of invitations to red-carpet events.
He is having a moment where the doors are open to working with the world's top designers, but that will have to wait. His focus on Monday was on one thing only, "and that's heading with my husband to Tahiti."

Texto completo: Two years ago -- in a move that delighted some in women's sports and shocked others -- Olivia Moultrie announced that she had accepted a scholarship offer to play college soccer at the University of North Carolina. She was 11 years old.
On Monday, Moultrie, the youngest girls' soccer player to publicly accept an academic scholarship offer, became the youngest girls' soccer player to then officially forgo her college athletic eligibility. Now 13, Moultrie announced that she had signed, in short order, a representation deal with the Wasserman Media Group, a sports agency, and a multiyear endorsement deal with Nike. In taking those two actions, Moultrie formally began her professional career.
Moultrie's agent, Spencer Wadsworth, declined to disclose the terms of the Nike deal, except to say that it was worth more financially than a four-year scholarship at a top university, which is generally valued at about $300,000.
"It's just a shift in women's sports," Wadsworth said. "You see it more and more now where women's soccer is catching up to the men's side, and there's more opportunities for them."
Moultrie has already drawn worldwide attention for her prodigious technical skills and her family's nontraditional approach to her nascent career. She has long played with older girls on the United States youth national team and with boys' clubs near her family's home in Canyon Country, Calif.
Last year, Moultrie made multiple trips to Europe to meet and train with some of the continent's biggest clubs: Olympique Lyon and Paris St.-Germain in France, and Bayern Munich in Germany. And with the help of her father, K.C., she has maintained an active presence on social media, often posting highlight clips to more than 87,000 followers on Instagram.
"I feel for literally almost every kid in girls' soccer, you should go to college; there's not a million dollars at the end of the rainbow," K.C. Moultrie said in an interview with The New York Times last year. "I think if you're truly, truly elite, if your goal is to be a world-class player and a pro and, in Olivia's case, to be the best player in the world, there's no way it's better to play college than it is to play full time."
Moultrie's next step is unclear. A move to Europe is most likely impossible for several years; FIFA rules, with certain exceptions, generally prevent youth prospects from signing with foreign clubs before they turn 18.
A far more likely prospect would involve Moultrie's latching on as a developmental player with a team in the top United States league, the N.W.S.L. But that path has its own obstacles; before she could ever sign a professional contract, the league would essentially have to create new allocation rules to deal with her unique situation. In addition, a player currently must be 18 to play in the N.W.S.L.
Moultrie has been on her unconventional path for years. She began intense, soccer-specific training when she was 7 years old, started home schooling as a fifth grader to free her schedule for more soccer, and eventually became the first girl to play for a boys' club team in the United States Development Academy system. She was 10 when she began attending college showcase camps, and at 11 she accepted a full scholarship offer from North Carolina.
That she gave up the scholarship was not a huge surprise. For one thing, sneaker companies like Nike and Adidas had long had Moultrie in their sights. Last year, when she was still an amateur, Nike featured her in a local promotional campaign for one of the company's soccer cleats. On Sunday night, Moultrie appeared briefly near the end of a Nike commercial that aired during the Academy Awards.

Nike, through a spokesman, declined to comment on its deal with Moultrie.
Anson Dorrance, the longtime coach at North Carolina who had offered Moultrie a scholarship, said in an interview on Monday that he was pleased Moultrie had signed a deal for what he presumed was a significant amount of money, noting that the vast majority of women's soccer players still struggle to make a steady living as professionals. He said Moultrie's deal was a good development for the women's game.
"We knew what was in the water, and we have no issue with this," Dorrance said about Moultrie's decision. "We lost a great player to the professional ranks, and we totally support that, if the financial incentives are good."
Though it has long been common for boys in the United States to skip college to pursue soccer careers, it is a move that has so far made sense for only a few girls.
Just two members of the current United States women's national team, for instance, have walked away from college scholarship offers for professional opportunities. Mallory Pugh was 19 when she did it two years ago, joining the N.W.S.L.'s Washington Spirit before ever suiting up for U.C.L.A. In 2012, Lindsey Horan joined P.S.G. at 18 after having accepted a scholarship offer from North Carolina.
But in doing so at 13, Moultrie has become an extreme outlier, even if -- in all likelihood -- it will be years before she has an opportunity to prove herself before a wide audience.
Dorrance said her skills were more than sufficient for her to thrive. The one, big question that remained, he said, was how much more she would mature physically.
"That's the risk for any young kid whose ambition is to play at a high level," Dorrance said, "or for a shoe company that is signing them young or a professional team that is signing them young."

Priests' roles in sex abuse researched

Texto completo: As Roman Catholic dioceses in New Jersey and across the country continue to release the names of hundreds of priests credibly accused of sexually abusing children over the decades, many are asking why this behavior seems to be so much more prevalent among priests than others.
Over the years, some have attributed the problem to the church's all-male clergy, the oath of celibacy, sexual orientation, or all of these factors combined.
But research has debunked the notion that celibacy or sexual orientation are at the root of the problem, and experts say sex offenders, though overwhelmingly men, are no more likely to be priests in the Catholic Church than filling similar roles of authority in any other institution.
"If people think that you're more likely to get sexually violated by a priest than by a stepfather or soccer coach or a school teacher, then you're just not paying attention to the data," said Thomas Plante, a psychology professor at Santa Clara University whose research has focused on sex offending clergy. "Sex abuse of children is a common phenomenon wherever you look, but particularly during the last half of the 20th century."
The American Psychiatric Association has found that about 3 to 5 percent of the general male population in the U.S. are pedophiles. And in 2004, a U.S. Department of Education study of educators committing sexual misconduct found that about 5 percent of school staff sexually violated children.
From 1950 to 2002, of the 109,694 priests in active ministry, 4,392 — or 4 percent — were accused of sexual abuse, according to a 2004 John Jay report on the nature and scope of the crisis.
New Jersey has 16,000 people on its sex offender registry, which is far less than 5 percent of its male population. But it's crucial to note only 30 percent of sexual abuse cases get reported to authorities, according to the U.S. Department of Justice.
Some experts say the reason priest sex abuse has become so prominent an issue is not because there are more sex abusers among priests than in the general population, but because victims have become more empowered to speak out.
Some of that has to do with societal changes, a growing freedom to talk about sex generally, and a declining number of churchgoers, which has made it easier to challenge a secretive church hierarchy that had closed ranks to protect abusive priests.
Holding church leaders accountable, reviewing policies pertaining to interaction with children, and more research on how the problem persists in other organizations is needed in order to limit the opportunities of abuse, experts say.
Long-running crisis The crisis in the Catholic Church has come into the spotlight again since August, when a Pennsylvania grand jury report detailed cases of abuse by more than 300 priests over 70 years.
Dioceses across the country have been releasing names of abusive priests since.
Recently, the church found former Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, the archbishop of the Newark Archdiocese from 1986 to 2000 and founding bishop of the Diocese of Metuchen in 1982, guilty of sexually abusing seminarians and minors over several decades. Last week, Pope Francis took the unusual step of defrocking McCarrick, who is the first U.S. cardinal known to have his ecclesiastical status revoked.
Pope Francis and bishops from around the world began meeting Thursday at the Vatican for a four-day conference to address the global crisis of the sexual abuse of minors by Catholic priests.
The Newark Archdiocese, along with New Jersey's four other dioceses — Paterson, Metuchen, Trenton and Camden — earlier this month released the names of 188 priests credibly accused of sexually abusing children. Many of those priests are dead, and the others have been removed from ministry. The lists didn't include names of those who are currently in litigation or under investigation, or those affiliated with religious orders.
The abuse in many cases took place years, even decades ago.
Experts say most cases of sexual abuse have gone unreported. The New Jersey Attorney General's office set up a hotline in the fall for survivors to report sexual abuse within the Catholic Church. The line was inundated with calls the first two weeks, the office said at the time.
"Clergy sexual abuse isn't a new problem, just one that's been given more attention — and for good reason — in the past few decades," said Dorothy Rogers, the chair of the religion department at Montclair State University.
Societal changes spurred by feminism and the gay rights movement have contributed to people being more open to look at the problem of sexual abuse, not only in the religious organizations but other institutions, Rogers said.
"People are more free now to talk about sex in general — including sexual abuse," she said.
According to the Pew Research Center, 67 percent of adults in New Jersey identify as Christian and 34 percent as Catholic. Rogers said less people across the country are religious, which makes it easier to hold church leaders accountable.
"More people in the U.S. now identify as non-religious than ever before, [so] more people see 'the church' as just one of many organizations and they ask: Why treat religious leaders or groups any differently?" Rogers said.
Prevention and education efforts have increased dramatically since the public became more aware of how pervasive child sexual abuse is.
Organizations where adults have contact with children — for example, the Boys and Girls Club of America, Boys Scouts of America, the Girl Scouts and public schools — have developed training to prevent child abuse and neglect.
Pedophilia Only a few of the priests accused of sexual abuse in the United States from 1950 to 2010 had serious pathological, developmental or psychological behaviors that could have led to their discovery before they committed abusive acts, according to a report by the John Jay College Research Team in 2011.
Less than 5 percent of the priests were motivated by pedophilia, according to the John Jay report, called "The Causes and Context of Sexual Abuse of Minors by Catholic Priests in the United States."
According the U.S. Department of Justice, about 60 percent of perpetrators of sexual abuse are known to the child but are not family members, such as family friends, child care providers and neighbors.
Some priests who committed sexual misconduct were abused as minors, the John Jay report stated.
"Priests who were sexually abused as minors themselves were more likely to abuse minors than those without a history of abuse," the report stated.
However, just because someone has been sexually abused as a child, doesn't mean they will become sex offenders and abuse others, according to research by the U.S. Department of Justice.
Celibacy, gay priests Some have pointed to celibacy as a contributing factor to priests sexually abusing children, but the John Jay study did not find this to be the case.
"Just because somebody can't have sex, doesn't mean they're going to go after kids," Plante said. "There are a lot of people out there who don't have sex for a variety of reasons, including medical problems, but they're not seducing children."
Church leaders have often blamed "homosexuality" as the reason behind the criminal acts of sexual abuse.
Though less than 10 percent of priests have publicly come out as gay in the country, about 30 to 40 percent of the American Catholic clergy are gay men, according to estimates from gay priests and researchers in a recent report by the New York Times.
But the John Jay study found that "priests who had same-sex sexual experiences either before seminary or in seminary," or who engaged in sex after ordination, "most likely" exhibited these behaviors with adults.
"These men were not significantly more likely to abuse minors," the study stated.
"Sadly, gay men have been terribly scapegoated," said Plante. "They're not more likely to harm a child than a straight person is. The vast majority of sex offenders out there are not gay men by any means. Many are married with families."

TED CRUZ WANTS EL CHAPO TO PAY FOR BORDER WALL

Resumen: As President Trump declares a national emergency at the border, calling it an "invasion," and "a major entry point for criminals, and illicit drugs," Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz is pushing the idea of taking money from convicted Mexican drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman Loera for the construction of the controversial border wall. Senator Cruz reintroduced his "El Chapo Act" last month. It was originally introduced in 2017. The bill, formally called The Ensuring Lawful Collection of Hidden Assets to Provide Order Act, would direct the federal government to use El Chapo's drug fortune and the fortunes of other drug smugglers to secure the US/Mexico border and invest in a border wall and other enforcement programs.

Texto completo: As President Trump declares a national emergency at the border, calling it an "invasion," and "a major entry point for criminals, and illicit drugs," Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz is pushing the idea of taking money from convicted Mexican drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzmán Loera for the construction of the controversial border wall.
Senator Cruz reintroduced his "El Chapo Act" last month. It was originally introduced in 2017.
The bill, formally called The Ensuring Lawful Collection of Hidden Assets to Provide Order (EL CHAPO) Act, would direct the federal government to use El Chapo's drug fortune and the fortunes of other drug smugglers to secure the U.S./Mexico border and invest in a border wall and other enforcement programs.
Guzmán, the leader of the violent Sinaloa drug cartel and considered Mexico's most notorious drug lord, was convicted earlier this month by a New York jury for multiple crimes related to international cocaine drug distribution and other charges.
The proposed bill is the "solution" for border security, and so is the border wall, Cruz said in a recent opinion piece in the Washington Post. He also continues to tweet he wants $14 billion from the Mexican drug kingpin, which is higher than the $5.7 billion Trump failed to get from Congress for the border wall.
Technically the Senator's idea is legal, but it also raises questions about its legitimacy and its effectiveness.
Currently, money seized in drug trafficking cases is deposited into the Justice Department's so-called Assets Forfeiture Fund, and the money is used in different ways including paying for police training, updating vehicles, uniforms, and other equipment, and in some cases for expenses such as overtime.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has said forfeiture was originally presented as a way to cripple large scale criminal enterprises by diverting their resources. But today, aided by deeply flawed federal and state laws, many police departments use forfeiture to benefit their bottom lines, making seizures motivated by profit rather than crime-fighting.
W. F. Strong, a 30-year resident of the Rio Grande Valley in Texas and a professor of communication at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley in Brownsville, said in a recent interview published in the New York Times that drug money was the "WD-40" of his community. "It's the oil that makes the machinery work, in all kinds of ways that we don't fully understand," Professor Strong said.
A number of studies and data, several from the federal government itself, also cast doubt on the border wall's effectiveness in securing the border and stopping the flow of drugs.
The U.S. Department of Justice last year issued a report which said the most common method of transporting drugs into the country is through the Ports of Entry.
Guzmán's trial itself revealed his cartel brought drugs across the border illegally with cars, trucks, trains, planes, tunnels, boats, and even submarines. One witness described cans of jalapenos were filled with cocaine and then hidden in tractor-trailers to successfully make it through the ports.
Drug overdoses killed 63,632 Americans in 2016, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and nearly 200 people died from overdoses every day in 2017.
The costs of substance abuse in the U.S. is over $600 billion annually, according the National Institute on Drug Abuse.
In light of those figures, Senator Cruz and President Trump remain focused on spending billions for a wall as the answer.
Last year, a report from the nonprofit the Center for American Progress found since 1971, the war on drugs has cost the United States an estimated $1 trillion. It also said the war on drugs is a failure and should be replaced with a fairer, more effective model that treats substance misuse as a public health issue and not a criminal justice issue.
Reuters, the international news agency, also recently reported that Stef Cassella, a former Justice Department official and forfeiture guru, said the law enforcement lobby, which has ample clout on Capitol Hill, also will most likely not support Cruz's bill.
"The law enforcement agencies have always resisted efforts to raid the fund to pay for other pet projects, and I suspect law enforcement agencies will have the same reaction to this proposal," Cassella stated.
Even President Trump's press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was criticized on social media after Guzmán's conviction. The newspaper The Independent reported that on Twitter, Sanders suggested a border wall would have been enough to stop the drug lord from bringing drugs into the country.
Whether spending funds to build a wall along the border will have effective results remains to be seen, but "Flaco," a veteran smuggler in Nogales told the New York Times in 2017 in an opinion piece by loan Grillo, his opinion of building a border wall.
"This is never going to stop, neither the narco trafficking nor the illegals," he says. "There will be more tunnels. More holes. If it doesn't go over, it will go under."

Senador Quiere que 'El Chapo' Pague el Muro Fronterizo
Mientras el presidente Trump declar' una emergencia nacional en la frontera, calific'ndola como "invasi'n" y 'un punto de entrada sidebar delincuentes y drogas il'citas", el senador republicano de Texas Ted Cruz est' promoviendo la idea de tomar dinero del narcotraficante convicto Joaqu'n 'El Chapo' Guzm'n Loera sidebar la construcci'n del pol'mico muro fronterizo.
El senador Cruz introdujo de nueva cuenta la 'Ley El Chapo" el mes pasado, la cual originalmente se introdujo en 2017.
Cruz dijo que dirigir'a al gobierno federal a utilizar la fortuna de drogas de El Chapo y las fortunas de otros narcotraficantes sidebar asegurar La frontera entre M'xico y Estados Unidos e invertir en un muro fronterizo y otros programas de cumplimiento.
Guzm'n, l'der del violento C'rtel de Sinaloa y considerado el narcotraficante m's famoso de M'xico, fue declarado culpable a principios de este mes por un jurado de Nueva York por m'ltiples delitos relacionados con la distribuci'n de drogas, asesinatos y otros cargos.
El proyecto de ley propuesto es la "soluci'n" sidebar la seguridad fronteriza, y tambi'n lo es el muro fronterizo, dijo Cruz en un art'culo de opini'n reciente en el Washington Post. Tambi'n contin'a tuiteando que quiere $ 14 mil millones del capo de la droga mexicano, que es m's alto que los $ 5.7 mil millones que Trump no pudo obtener del Congreso sidebar el muro fronterizo.
T'cnicamente, la idea del senador es legal, pero tambi'n plantea dudas sobre su legitimidad y su eficacia.
Actualmente, el dinero incautado en casos de tr'fico de drogas se deposita en el llamado Fondo de Decomiso de Activos del Departamento de Justicia, y el dinero se utiliza de diferentes maneras, como el pago de capacitaci'n policial, la actualizaci'n de veh'culos, uniformes y otros equipos y, en algunos casos, sidebar gastos tales como como horas extras.
La Uni'n Americana de Libertades Civiles (ACLU, por sus siglas en ingl's) ha dicho que la confiscaci'n se present' originalmente como una forma de sidebarlizar empresas criminales a gran escala al desviar sus recursos. Pero hoy, con la ayuda de leyes federales y estatales profundamente defectuosas, muchos departamentos de polic'a utilizan el decomiso sidebar beneficiar sus resultados, haciendo incautaciones motivadas por ganancias en lugar de luchar contra el crimen.
W.F. Strong, residente de 30 a'os del Valle del R'o Grande en Texas y profesor de comunicaci'n en la Universidad del Valle del R'o Grande de Texas en Brownsville, dijo en una reciente entrevista publicada en el New York Times que el dinero de las drogas era el "WD-40' de su comunidad. "Es el aceite el que hace que la maquinaria funcione, en todo tipo de formas que no entendemos completamente", afirm'.
Varios estudios e informaci'n, varios del propio gobierno federal, tambi'n ponen en duda la efectividad del muro fronterizo sidebar proteger la frontera y detener el flujo de drogas.
El a'o pasado, el Departamento de Justicia de los Estados Unidos emiti' un informe que dec'a que el m'todo m's com'n sidebar transportar drogas al pa's es a trav's de los puertos de entrada.
El juicio de Guzm'n mismo revel' que su cartel trajo drogas a trav's de la frontera ilegalmente con autos, trenes, aviones, t'neles, barcos e incluso submarinos. Un testigo describi' que latas de jalape'os estaban llenas de coca'na, luego se escond'an en remolques de tractores y sal'an con 'xito a trav's de los puertos.
Las sobredosis de drogas mataron a 63,632 estadounidenses en 2016, de acuerdo con los Centros sidebar el Control y la Prevenci'n de Enfermedades y cerca de 200 personas murieron a causa de las sobredosis todos los d'as en 2017.
El costo del abuso de sustancias en los Estados Unidos es de m's de $ 600 mil millones anuales, seg'n el Instituto Nacional sobre el Abuso de Drogas.
A la luz de esas cifras, el senador Cruz y el presidente Trump est'n enfocados en gastar miles de millones en un muro.
El a'o pasado, un informe de la organizaci'n sin fines de lucro Center for American Progress, encontr' que desde 1971, la guerra contra las drogas le ha costado a los Estados Unidos un estimado de mil millones de d'lares. Tambi'n dijo que la guerra contra las drogas es un fracaso y debe ser reemplazada por un modelo m's justo y efectivo que trata el abuso de sustancias como un problema de salud p'blica y no como un problema de justicia penal.
La agencia de noticias internacional Reuters tambi'n inform' recientemente que Stef Cassella, un ex funcionario del Departamento de Justicia, dijo que el lobby de la ley, que tiene una gran influencia en el Capitolio, probablemente no apoyar' el proyecto de ley de Cruz.
"Las agencias de aplicaci'n de la ley siempre se han resistido a los esfuerzos sidebar asaltar el fondo sidebar pagar otros proyectos de mascotas, y sospecho que las agencias de aplicaci'n de la ley tendr'n la misma reacci'n a esta propuesta", se'al' Cassella.
Incluso la secretaria de prensa del presidente Trump, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, fue criticada en las redes sociales tras la condena de Guzm'n. El peri'dico, the Independent inform' que en Twitter, Sanders sugiri' que un muro fronterizo hubiera sido suficiente sidebar evitar que el capataz trajera drogas al pa's.
Queda por verse si gastar fondos sidebar construir un muro a lo largo de la frontera tendr' resultados efectivos, pero "Flaco", un veterano contrabandista en Nogales, le dijo al New York Times en 2017 en un art'culo de opini'n, su opini'n sobre la construcci'n de un muro fronterizo.
"Esto nunca va a sidebarr, ni el narcotr'fico ni los ilegales", dice. 'Habr' m's t'neles. M's agujeros. Si no se pasa por arriba, se pasar' por abajo".

Texto completo: “Sometimes, parenting is boring”
That’s a headline in The New York Times this week that caught my eye, and made me almost laugh out loud. “Sometimes?” I thought. “Understatement of the century.”
Sure, parenthood has occasional euphoric moments of excitement. A first word! A first step! You did your own laundry! You cleared a dish without being asked 50 times!
These moments are what we parents live for. They affirm that we are doing something right. We are on the right track and our children are progressing. These moments are nothing short of thrilling for mom and dad.
But then, there are the other moments. The ones that take up the majority of the day in, day out of parenthood. And while The New York Times is playing it coy with the use of the word “boring,” I’m going to go out on a limb here and call a spade a spade: parenthood can be mind-numbingly dull. If you’ve ever spent an afternoon with an 8-month-old, you know exactly what I’m talking about.
I recently baby-sat one such adorable 8-month-old. She is sweet and smiley and everything you’d want in a baby companion for the afternoon.
But still, I found myself having flashbacks to the infant days of my own children. Sitting on the floor, listening to the “Cookie Jar Song” on the shape sorter sing for the 50th time. Zoning out for minutes at a time while watching lights blink on some plastic contraption. Contemplating jamming a teething toy into my retina just for the sake of having something to do.
When this baby’s mother got home, I confessed my sins. I told her how playtime with anyone under at least 3 is really not “my thing,” and how I had all but forgotten how tedious it is. She immediately commiserated, telling me how she once zoned out so long during baby playtime that she only came to when she realized her hair was wound up in a spinning Goofy figure that was slowly sucking her into the toy’s innards.
We talked for a while about the mind-numbing nature of parenting little ones, and honestly, it felt good to say it out loud. Much of the time, we feel like we’re not being “good moms” if we’re bored. Like we should somehow morph from well-educated, interesting women into full-time baby playmates who are completely fulfilled by motherhood and riveted by every peek-a-booing minute of it.
This is especially true when you’re smack in the middle of these years. You can’t admit you’re bored because hey, you’re the one who wanted this baby, right? And if you tell your mom friends that you find some aspects of motherhood downright dull, what will they think? Surely they don’t wish for the sweet release of naptime or fantasize about throwing the “Cookie Jar” toy out the window just to make it stop.
Do they?
Well, I’ve been out of the baby stage long enough that I feel safe enough to admit it: Yes. They do. We all do, sometimes.
My youngest is now 2½, and while I still engage in a less-than-riveting puzzle or castle-building session now and again, I’m glad that my sitting-with-a-baby-who-can’t-really-do-anything days are over.
Those days are painful. Painful.
So why do we do it? Would our kids even care if we were scrolling Instagram rather than staring at them? Does me sitting here, clapping maniacally for raspberry sounds even matter?
Well, here’s the insightful conclusion from the New York Times article:
“… don’t let yourself off the hook, push yourself to pay attention because the connections you forge with young children are the most important thing in their world, but you do it through the repetitive interactions and often tedious games and those drive-you-crazy songs.
"And sometimes every moment will be a heartfelt expression of profound parental love, and sometimes you will be very bored, and the two are not as far apart as you might think.”
Admitting motherhood isn't a total, nonstop thrill-fest doesn't make me a terrible mother. It makes me an amazing one because I wasn’t sitting by my babies all those days and hours and everlasting minutes for me . If I was, I definitely would have been doing something more entertaining. I was doing it for the little person next to me, who thought it was hilarious when I peeked out from behind the washcloth and who shimmied to the rhythm of the “Cookie Jar Song.”
Even though I may have been bored out of my mind, my babies were not. My babies were growing and learning and maybe on some level, understanding that mom will be there for all the moments — the thrilling big ones and the mundane ones — because even though I can’t always see it, every single moment together has been a big one to them.

Folk musician best known for TV band the Monkees

Texto completo: Peter Tork, a blues and folk musician who became a teeny-bopper sensation as a member of the Monkees, the wisecracking, made-for-TV pop group that imitated and briefly outsold the Beatles, died Feb. 21. He was 77.
His death was confirmed by his sister Anne Thorkelson, who did not say where or how he died. Tork was diagnosed with adenoid cystic carcinoma, a rare cancer affecting his tongue, in 2009.
If the Monkees were a manufactured version of the Beatles, a "prefab four" who auditioned for a rock 'n' roll sitcom and were selected more for their long-haired good looks than their musical abilities, Tork was the group's Ringo, its lovably goofy supporting player.
A versatile multi-instrumentalist, Tork mostly played bass and keyboard for the Monkees.
At 24, he was also the band's oldest member when "The Monkees" premiered on NBC in 1966. Not that it mattered: "The emotional age of all of us," he told The New York Times that year, "is 13."
Created by producers Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider, "The Monkees" was designed to replicate the success of "A Hard Day's Night" and "Help!" - director Richard Lester's musical comedies about the Beatles.
The band featured Tork alongside Michael Nesmith, a singer-songwriter who played guitar, and former child actors Micky Dolenz and Davy Jones, who played the drums and sang lead, respectively.
"The Monkees" ran for only two seasons but won an Emmy Award for outstanding comedy. In 1967, according to one report in The Washington Post, the Monkees sold 35 million albums - "twice as many as the Beatles and Rolling Stones combined" - on the strength of songs such as "Daydream Believer," "I'm a Believer" and "Last Train to Clarksville," which all rose to No. 1 on the Billboard record chart.
While the band scored a total of six Top 10 songs and five Top 10 albums, it engendered as much critical scorn as commercial success.
Detractors pointed to the fact that the band, at least initially, existed only in name. While the Monkees appeared on the cover of their debut album and were shown performing on TV, their instruments were unplugged. The songs were mostly done by session musicians - much to the shock of Tork.
After the release of the band's second album, "More of the Monkees" (1967), Tork and his bandmates wrested control of the recording process. They also started touring, playing to sold-out stadium crowds and backed by opening acts that briefly included guitarist Jimi Hendrix.
But as Tork's musical ambitions grew, and he began to clash with bandmates who saw the Monkees as more of a novelty act. He left the group soon after the release of "Head," a satirical, nearly plot-free film flop that featured a screenplay co-written by actor Jack Nicholson.
For much of the 1970s, Tork struggled to find his own way. He formed an unsuccessful band called Release, was imprisoned for several months in 1972 after being caught with "$3 worth of hashish in my pocket," and worked as a high school teacher and "singing waiter" as his Monkees wealth dried up. He said he struggled with alcohol addiction before quitting in the early 1980s.
By then, television reruns and album reissues had fueled a resurgence of interest in the Monkees, and Tork had come around to what he described as the essential nature of the music group, which he joined for major reunion tours about once a decade, beginning in the mid-'80s. Tork also performed during that time as a solo artist.
Tork's marriages to Jody Babb, Reine Stewart and Barbara Iannoli ended in divorce. In addition to his sister, survivors include his wife, Pamela Grapes, two daughters, a son and a brother.

Seeing a reflection that's not perfection

Texto completo: It says something about Kate Hamill's sensibility that her current stage adaptation of William Thackeray's sprawling 19th-century satire "Vanity Fair" was partly inspired by bad audience behavior as she watched a production of "Hamlet."
"A woman and husband were sitting in front of me," Hamill says, "and the woman kept leaning over and giving the most judgmental spoilers: 'Just watch. He's terrible to his mother.' " The New York-based actress and playwright spoke by phone from San Diego, where she is working on a historical drama called "The Prostitute Play."
Hamill laughs - she laughs a lot as she discusses the great works of literature she's been wrangling onto the stage, from her coast-to-coast hit "Sense and Sensibility" (seen in 2016 at the Folger Theatre) to such new projects as a fresh "Little Women" and a tantalizing something titled "Scrooge for Senate." But she was fascinated by the notion of distance - that a viewer could think the story taking place onstage was not about now .
"They are, of course, our stories," says Hamill, who played the wily, social-climbing orphan Becky Sharp in the 2017 off-Broadway premiere of "Vanity Fair." "They're cultural touchstones. 'Vanity Fair' challenges audiences to think that we are not different from these people."
Finding modern echoes in the past is drawing Hamill back to her script for "The Prostitute Play," about political romance and blackmail involving 19th-century courtesan Harriette Wilson. "I wrote it in 2015, and I'm re-rewriting now," Hamill says. "It has very Stormy Daniels-esque tones."
Hamill has slightly tweaked her script for the "Vanity Fair" production that starts Tuesday at the Shakespeare Theatre Company, with new director Jessica Stone and a fresh cast of merely seven. ("A gift to actors," the New York Times declared of the adaptation.) The main figures are the opportunistic, lower-class Becky Sharp (Rebekah Brockman in this new staging, co-produced with San Francisco's American Conservatory Theater) and the high-society Amelia Sedley (Maribel Martinez), with social mores under the microscope.
Q: Why "Vanity Fair"? A: I was frustrated by the dearth of female narratives, especially narratives with the female gaze. I was auditioning for all kinds of parts where the women did not reflect women I knew in life. They were not funny, or vulgar, or flawed. They were cardboard types to help the male protagonist on his journey. So I'm really interested in creating female characters where I don't care if they're likable. I care if we understand them. "Not likable ." The men don't get those notes. We say Macbeth can murder half the country, but you know who's really wicked? Lady Macbeth!
Q: Becky Sharp - she appeals to you? A: That was not the chief appeal. I played Becky, but I did not want to make it just Becky's story. Most adaptations do. I get it. She's sort of fun. But it's interesting that we tend to judge one as the "good" woman and one as the "bad" woman. I set them up in exactly parallel structures, putting them in the same situations over and over - one of them scrabbling up from the bottom, one from privilege. Both run up against the judgments of society. That's still true of women today. You can never win under the rules society has set up for you. You're too smart, or not smart enough. Too sexy, or not sexy enough. No one can win.
Q: Sounds like you are going to have fun watching the presidential campaign unfold. A: I've found it very, very frustrating how female politicians are treated, and that, for me, is the connection to Becky Sharp. She is ambitious. It's interesting to see how people judge her as heartless and sociopathic. I take a radical approach to adaptation. It's not copy-and-paste; it's writing a new play - a collaboration between myself and an author who's dead. So it's a take. I came close to working in politics - journalism or politics - and the personal is political in this play. It's about women trying to get what they want in a society that judges them.
Q: The New York Times review of the show claimed that Becky Sharp is not a feminist hero. Do you agree? A: Working on adaptations like "The Odyssey" or "Vanity Fair" - they were written before the theory - so they're proto-feminists. Becky is Becky-ist. When you come from crushing poverty, there is no nobility in poverty. There is desperation never to be there again. Becky is not lifting all women.
Q: What do you like about the voice of the book? A: Most of the dialogue is mine; I'd say 90 percent. What I loved is the clear-eyed view of hypocrisy, how Thackeray can't help being fond of these characters even as he makes fun of their hypocrisy. Thackeray uses a puppet master - which I turned into a manager of a theater troupe - that puts on this play for us. He pushes it to more of an extreme, because it's a satire. I wanted them to be more honest, human women. But his shaping of Becky and Amelia is funny and beautiful. That shines through, even as he's taking this sharp knife to society. Taking a real hard look at idols and institutions is something I was really interested in. And it's funny. There's a scene in the play about a woman giving a philosophical talk about society and class, and she's farting the whole time. I made it up, but I was inspired by Thackeray's mix of high and low. Nothing's too sacred to re-examine. You could say I'm scribbling in crayon on the altar, but I think that's what Thackeray was doing.
Q: Is there an irony in your finding good material for actresses in 19th-century works? A: I also write new plays, and I believe in new stories. But we teach these things in our schools. Why not try to reclaim them for everyone? Every person who's not a white man watches "Hamlet" and puts themselves in Hamlet's shoes. So now I'm trying to flip the script a bit and reclaim those things. My dad told me "The Odyssey" as bedtime stories, and as a little kid, I was not sitting there going, "How could I be Odysseus? I'm a girl ." It's the same discussion as making things inclusive, casting-wise. These stories still have power, but we have to make sure everyone has ownership.
Q: What's the last thing you'd expect to find yourself in onstage? A: If you say you're never going to do something, it inevitably happens to you within the next couple years. I loathe Ayn Rand, so it would be fascinating to be in some Ayn Rand piece, because it would be hard. As an actor, I try to pick stuff I'm really interested in. Otherwise, I think the audience could read it on me.

Trump escalates his attack on Times in latest tweet

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — President Trump on Wednesday took direct aim at The New York Times, calling the news organization a “true ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE," in an escalation from his previous lashings, which were typically addressed to a group of news organizations or over specific Times articles.
Trump did not cite a specific article in his Twitter post, but his declaration came a day after The Times published a report describing how he had tried to influence and undermine investigations surrounding him, his presidential campaign, and his administration.
Trump has long denigrated American news outlets that in his view deliver less-than-favorable reports.
The president has periodically returned to that expression during moments of peak criticism. But Wednesday's denigration went a step further, suggesting that The Times reporting, across the board, was not to be trusted and was done to the detriment of Americans.
The Times' publisher, A.G. Sulzberger, in a statement cited previous presidents of both political parties who not only championed the free press, but said it was a crucial foundation of a free society.
“But in demonizing the free press as the enemy, simply for performing its role of asking difficult questions and bringing uncomfortable information to light, President Trump is retreating from a distinctly American principle," Sulzberger said.
The Times also defended the article about Trump, which it said “was rigorously reported and based on a review of confidential White House documents as well as interviews with dozens of current and former government officials and others close to President Trump."
A Times reporter contacted the White House about the article on Friday, days before it was published, and continued to press for comment over the following days.

Lawmakers rally behind intelligence director
WASHINGTON — Several Republican and Democratic lawmakers threw their support Wednesday behind Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats, who some administration officials worry may soon be dismissed from his position by President Trump.
The Washington Post reported Tuesday that, according to people familiar with the matter, Trump has become frustrated with Coats over public statements that the president views as undercutting his policy goals.
In an exchange with reporters in the Oval Office on Wednesday afternoon, Trump said he was not thinking about removing Coats.
Nonetheless, lawmakers have reacted with alarm to the prospect of Coats's dismissal.
Senator Susan Collins, a Maine Republican and member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, issued a statement on Twitter on Wednesday defending Coats, a former Republican senator from Indiana who had served on the panel.
Her colleague, Senator Angus King, an independent who also sits on the intelligence panel, described Coats as "a model public servant" and voiced concern about the prospect of his firing in a statement.
The prospect of Coats's dismissal prompted an outcry from members of the House as well.
House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, Democrat of California, said in a tweet that Coats "has been doing an outstanding job."
"He speaks truth to power and gives policy makers the best intelligence possible," Schiff said.
Representative Susan Brooks, who like Coats is a Republican from Indiana, said in a statement it would be "very worrisome" if Trump removed Coats "due to differences of opinion regarding national security matters."

Sanders says he raised $6m in 1 day for presidential bidWASHINGTON — In the 24 hours since launching his second presidential bid, Bernie Sanders has raised roughly $6 million, announced a campaign manager — and drawn the notice of President Trump.
The independent senator from Vermont, who built a deep stable of low-dollar donors during his 2016 campaign, touted his fund-raising haul in a Wednesday morning tweet, in which he claimed 225,000 contributors since making his new bid official Tuesday morning.
There will be no official record of early campaign donations for several weeks.
In morning tweets Wednesday, Trump also greeted Sanders' entry into the contest.
"Crazy Bernie has just entered the race. I wish him well!" Trump said, using the same nickname he used to deride Sanders when he sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016.
Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, responded on Twitter shortly afterward.
"What's crazy is that we have a president who is a racist, a sexist, a xenophobe and a fraud," he wrote.
Sanders announced his second White House bid Tuesday.

Texto completo: Russian President Vladimir Putin warned Wednesday that Moscow will target the United States with its new hypersonic missiles if the Trump administration follows its scrapping of a key arms control agreement by deploying new intermediate-range missiles in Europe.
The US started this tit-for-tat
By John Glaser
Russian President Vladimir Putin has issued a clear warning to the United States: If Washington deploys new intermediate-range missiles in Europe, Moscow will, too.
The context behind this threat is President Donald Trump's withdrawal from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. Negotiated in 1987 by President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, the INF was a fairly successful arms-control agreement in which each party agreed to eliminate a whole class of missiles.
In recent years, both sides accused each other of failing to fully uphold the agreement. Instead of pursuing diplomacy to resolve the dispute, Trump ordered a unilateral withdrawal, accompanied by a promise to start deploying the prohibited weapons.
Putin's threat might seem like cause for alarm, but Americans should keep two things in mind.
Talker: Will Trump's emergency declaration stand up in court?
Ask your friends and family to sign-up for the Today's Talker newsletter
First, hard-line policies against Russia increase the likelihood that Russia will respond in kind. From Moscow's perspective, this is a reaction to an onslaught of provocations from Washington. For all the allegations of Trump's weakness on Russia, the administration's official strategy documents single out Russia as a principal threat to U. S. security.
In addition to withdrawing from the INF, Washington has imposed harsh economic sanctions on Moscow as punishment for meddling in Ukraine. Other U. S. policies contribute to Russian feelings of insecurity. Trump has increased troop deployments in Europe and is considering opening a new military base in Poland.
Second, Putin’s threat is just not all that threatening. For starters, the threat was conditional: He vowed that Russia will not be the first to deploy new intermediate-range missiles, but it will do so if the United States does first. He also expressed a willingness to return to the negotiating table, insisting that "we don't want confrontation. "
More to the point, Russian military power hardly presents a direct threat to America. Its gross domestic product is about $1. 6 trillion, less than a 10th of ours, and its annual military spending is a mere $66. 3 billion, compared with the more than $700 billion that we spend. Russia has nukes but possesses limited power-projection capabilities and few allies that can aid its out-of-area ambitions.
Russia certainly acts aggressively in its near abroad, but Europe can easily deter it. Europe vastly outspends Russia on defense, at almost $285 billion per year.
Washington tends to inflate the threat from Moscow, while simultaneously ignoring U. S. policies that exacerbate tensions. A new arms race in Europe was a predictable consequence of Trump's withdrawal from the INF. Luckily, there’s still time for peaceful diplomacy to mitigate these risks. Whether the political will exists is another question entirely.

What others are saying
Russian President Vladimir Putin, address to Russian parliament: "Among the U. S. ruling class, there are a lot of people who are too taken with the idea of their exceptionalism, of their supremacy over everyone else. Of course, it's their right to think whatever way they want. But can they count? I'm sure they can. Let them count the range and speed of the weapons systems we are developing. That's all we ask. "
Scott Dworkin‏, Twitter: "Putin threatened the U. S. on Wednesday. President Donald Trump's response? Nothing. Putin's puppet' said nothing about Russia threatening the U. S. Trump's (allegedly) too busy obstructing justice, colluding with Russia, attacking the Justice Department, the FBI and the press. Biggest traitor ever. It's time to impeach Trump. "
Theodore Postol, The New York Times: "America must recognize that the Obama administration inadvertently chose a land-based missile defense system with no defensive capacity that instead looks like a strike system to Russia. The Trump administration must stop its extremists from ending a meaningful treaty and putting the world on a faster path to oblivion. And the Russians need to pull back from their threats and boasts about their new missiles — a foolish and dangerous reaction to American bungling that plays against their own self-interest. Everyone will win if the will exists to make those compromises. Everyone will lose if not. "
What our readers are saying
Don't bet on Russian President Vladimir Putin not getting his way. If President Donald Trump doesn't gather up courage on this issue, we better make sure he doesn't deploy missiles at our European allies.
— Warren Weick
Think about the outcome, if Trump deploys missiles to Europe: Putin loses his shackles, he can go public with his missile programs and he can just say he is simply reacting to U. S. aggression, and withdraw from the treaty. We just gave the Kremlin moral superiority in the eyes of the Russian people. What does Putin lose?
— Zheng Chen
Americans, your Congress is the enemy of your state. We want to trade peacefully with you, but your Congress has begun a new Cold War and the people of the United States are suffering losses. Your weapons in Europe do not benefit our relations, and Russia will have to deploy its nuclear missiles in Haiti.
— Pavlique Cher

No house, no stuff; Sylvie wasn't Kondo-izing. She was being evicted.

Texto completo: My French neighbor Sylvie knocked on my apartment door the other night, asking if I wanted a motorcycle helmet. It was brand new, a gift from her ex, and she knew that my husband rode a motorcycle -- did we need an extra helmet?
I thought perhaps she'd been watching "Tidying Up with Marie Kondo," on Netflix, where the soft-spoken Japanese superstar of de-cluttering instructs people to purge their closets and lives of items that don't "spark joy."
On Instagram, my friends are proudly posting pictures of piles unwanted clothes on the floor and "after" snaps of their newly immaculate closets, having binge-watched Kondo's show.

I tried it too. The weekend before Sylvie came over, I took everything out of our kitchen cupboards, and held up the cheap wine glasses I'd bought on Gilt, asking "Do these spark joy?" It's a lot to ask of a wine glass. (They went in the giveaway pile.)
But my neighbor wasn't Kondo-ing. At 53, she was being evicted.
Standing in my doorway, she gave me a quick rundown of what had happened: She and her partner split, he moved out, taking a large sum of her money with him. Her interior design business was floundering -- three clients had bailed in one month. She got a roommate, but then had to replace the rent-sharer with her adult son who got out of rehab and had no place else to go.
Everything hit at once, and she was unable to pay rent for three months and now she was being evicted. She wasn't asking for pity, but she was struggling.
She had decided her best option was to end her life, but then she had second thoughts and went to a downtown public health clinic. She looked around at the other women in the waiting room. "All homeless," she told me. She realized she was now one of them. She saw a doctor, got meds, was feeling a little better.
Which brought her to my door, with the motorcycle helmet. It was new, and such a waste to trash, she said.
I followed her back to her place, volunteering to help clean, as she had to be out the next day. Standing in her half-empty apartment, I thought of Kondo's show. A lot of what remained of Sylvie's possessions sparked joy. It was all going into the trash anyway.
"These have been in my family for over 50 years," said Sylvie, handing over matching rose-colored ceramic bowls, and a special dish just for strawberries, with tiny holes in the bottom of the top plate, allowing water to drain through, so the strawberries stay firm. "Very French," she said.
There were Baccarat crystal glasses that had been part of her grandmother's wedding trousseau. She clicked two empty champagne coupes together and they made a clear, ringing song that my glasses could never aspire to.
Wait, I thought. Where's Lulu, the German shepherd Sylvie brought home as a rambunctious puppy a few years back. "Don't jump, Lulu," she'd say. As if not understanding the thickly accented English, Lulu always jumped anyway. Now, Lulu was mammoth, dragging Sylvie daily by her leash. But that night in the apartment -- no Lulu. I decided not to ask.
As we swept dust and dog hair in the empty rooms, Sylvie finally volunteered. Lulu was at a boarding facility. Sylvie broke down in tears. "They said they would find her a good family," she told me, and then she couldn't speak any more, bawling in my arms.
How could she keep Lulu if she didn't have a home? She spoke again about wanting to end her life. I told her she made the right decision to see a doctor, that we could get her help.
Women alone and over 50 are one of the largest homeless populations in the city, and their numbers are growing. What are the support systems for someone who abruptly finds herself destitute? Sylvie had lived in L.A. most of her adult life; if she'd stayed in her native France, I can't imagine she would have found herself in this position.
In the days that followed, Sylvie moved into a co-living house in Studio City that she shares with nine strangers.
We watch and emulate Marie Kondo tidying and organizing, but I wonder if we're preparing for something much bleaker. Privilege is the precondition for getting rid of stuff, but I set our liquidation efforts against the backdrop of a horrific housing crisis in L.A. It could take any one of us down quickly.
Life here is becoming untenable. I love this city, but I don't know how much longer I can afford to stay.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Former acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe hinted at an "inappropriate relationship" between President Donald Trump and Russia during a wide-ranging interview on CBS' "60 Minutes" that has already sparked calls for a congressional investigation.
Speaking to "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley, McCabe said the FBI had reasonable cause to open a counterintelligence investigation into Trump's connection with the Russian government, a potential national security threat, following the firing of then-FBI Director James Comey in May 2017.
He also said Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein was "not joking" when he offered to wear a wire into the White House to "collect evidence" into Trump's motivation for firing Comey.
"And the idea is, if the president committed obstruction of justice, fired the director of the FBI to negatively impact or to shut down our investigation of Russia's malign activity and possibly in support of his campaign, as a counterintelligence investigator, you have to ask yourself, 'Why would a president of the United States do that?'" McCabe said on "60 Minutes. "
"So all those same sorts of facts cause us to wonder if there is an inappropriate relationship, a connection between this president and our most fearsome enemy, the government of Russia?"
Asked by Pelley if Trump is "in league with the Russians," McCabe said, "I'm saying that the FBI had reason to investigate that. Right – to investigate the existence of an investigation doesn't mean someone is guilty. I would say, Scott, if we failed to open an investigation under those circumstances, we wouldn't be doing our jobs. "
Prior to the airing of McCabe's interview, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, said Sunday he planned to conduct a Senate investigation into what he characterized as "an attempted bureaucratic coup. "
"We're going to find out what happened here and the only way I know to find out is to call the people in under oath and find out, through questioning, who's telling the truth because the underlying accusation is beyond stunning," Graham said on CBS' "Face the Nation. "
Graham, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, added that he would subpoena McCabe and Rosenstein if they did not agree to testify voluntarily.
Via Twitter, Trump responded Thursday to the news of McCabe's interview by calling him a "disgrace to the FBI and to our Country" who was trying to pretend to be a "poor little Angel. " He also repeated many of his past criticisms of McCabe, who he says helped start the "Russia hoax" and was biased in favor of Hillary Clinton.
During the "60 Minutes" interview, McCabe said Rosenstein resisted Trump's insistence of referencing Russia in a memo to justify Comey's firing — "And the president responded, 'I understand that, I am asking you to put Russia in the memo anyway,'" he said — and later raised the idea of wearing a wire to the White House.
"He said, “I never get searched when I go into the White House. I could easily wear a recording device. They wouldn’t know it was there,” McCabe said. "Now, he was not joking. He was absolutely serious. And, in fact, he brought it up in the next meeting we had. "
He added, "I never actually considered taking him up on the offer. "
The Justice Department last September, responding to a New York Times report that first revealed the conversation, issued a statement from another official who was in the room and interpreted Rosenstein's offer as sarcastic.
Asked during Sunday's interview if Rosenstein supported obstruction and counterintelligence investigations against Trump, McCabe answered, "Absolutely. "
McCabe was fired from the Justice Department last March by then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions for "an unauthorized disclosure to the news media and lacked candor − including under oath − on multiple occasions. " In the "60 Minutes" interview, McCabe described his firing as politically motivated, telling Pelley he was authorized to release information to the media.
"When is someone going to finally investigate the investa(g)tors?" tweeted the president's oldest son, Donald Trump Jr. , on Friday. "If this isn’t an attempted coup I don’t know what is. Regardless of party if you’re not troubled by this, you’re part of the problem. "
In the "60 Minutes" interview, McCabe recalled meeting with Trump after the president had just fired Comey.
"I was speaking to the man who had just run for the presidency," McCabe said. "And won the election for the presidency and who might have done so with the aid of the government of Russia, our most formidable adversary on the world stage. "
"And that was something that troubled me greatly," he added.
When Pelley asked how long after Comey's firing he decided to begin an investigation into possible obstruction of justice by the president, McCabe replied, "I think the next day, I met with the team investigating the Russia cases and I asked the team to go back and conduct an assessment to determine 'Where are we with these efforts and what steps do we need to take going forward?'"
McCabe said he was "very concerned" and wanted to make sure that he had "the Russia case on absolutely solid ground, in an indelible fashion. " He said wanted to make sure that if he was "removed quickly, or reassigned or fired, that the case could not be closed or vanish without a trace in the night. "
His book, “The Threat: How the FBI Protects America in the Age of Terror and Trump," hit bookshelves on Tuesday.

WHAT SCIENCE CAN LEARN FROM RELIGION HOSTILITY TOWARD SPIRITUAL TRADITIONS MAY BE HAMPERING EMPIRICAL INQUIRY, ARGUES DAVID DESTENO

Texto completo: Science and religion seem to be getting ever more tribal in their mutual recriminations, at least among hard-line advocates. While fundamentalist faiths cast science as a misguided or even malicious source of information, polemicizing scientists argue that religion isn't just wrong or meaningless but also dangerous.
I am no apologist for religion. As a psychologist, I believe that the scientific method provides the best tools with which to unlock the secrets of human nature. But after decades spent trying to understand how our minds work, I've begun to worry that the divide between religious and scientific communities might not only be stoking needless hostility; it might also be slowing the process of scientific discovery itself.
Religious traditions offer a rich store of ideas about what human beings are like and how they can satisfy their deepest moral and social needs. For thousands of years, people have turned to spiritual leaders and religious communities for guidance about how to conduct themselves, how to coexist with other people, how to live meaningful and fulfilled lives - and how to accomplish this in the face of the many obstacles to doing so. The biologist Richard Dawkins, a vocal critic of religion, has said that in listening to and debating theologians, he has "never heard them say anything of the smallest use." Yet it is hubristic to assume that religious thinkers who have grappled for centuries with the workings of the human mind have never discovered anything of interest to scientists studying human behavior.
Just as ancient doesn't always mean wise, it doesn't always mean foolish. The only way to determine which is the case is to put an idea - a hypothesis - to an empirical test. In my own work, I have repeatedly done so. I have found that religious ideas about human behavior and how to influence it, though never worthy of blind embrace, are sometimes vindicated by scientific examination.
Consider the challenge of getting people to act in virtuous ways. Every religion has its tools for doing this. Meditation, for example, is a Buddhist technique created to reduce suffering and enhance ethical behavior. Research from my own and others' labs confirms that it does just that, even when meditation is taught and performed in a completely secular context, leading research participants to exhibit greater compassion in the face of suffering and to forgo vengeance in the face of insult.
Another religious tool is ritual, often characterized by the rigid following of repetitive actions or by engagement with others in synchronous movement or song. Here, too, an emerging body of research shows that ritualistic actions, even when stripped from a religious context, produce effects on the mind ranging from increased self-control to greater feelings of affiliation and empathy.
Ritual can also play a part in strengthening beliefs. Research on cognitive dissonance has shown that publicly stating beliefs that we don't initially endorse leads to a psychological tension that is often remedied by altering our beliefs and behaviors to match our public pronouncements. Thus the religious practice of repeatedly stating beliefs as part of prayers - as in the Catholic Mass - may enhance devotion to a creed.
What findings like these suggest is that religions offer techniques - or "spiritual technologies," in the words of Krista Tippett, the host of the radio show "On Being" - that help people endure difficulties, change their views or move them toward action. These techniques seem to work by nudging our behavior subconsciously. Ms. Tippett stresses that the specific religious traditions from which such techniques are borrowed should be understood and honored on their own terms. But when I spoke with her recently, she also agreed that the techniques might work even when separated from their religious trappings, as meditation and elements of ritual have been shown to do.
If this view is right, religion can offer tools to bolster secular interventions of many types, such as combating addiction, increasing exercise, saving money and encouraging people to help those in need. This possibility dovetails with a parallel body of research showing that by cultivating traditional religious virtues such as gratitude and kindness, people can also improve their ability to reach personal goals like financial and educational success.
When I broached this body of research with the cognitive scientist and religious skeptic Steven Pinker, he emphasized that it was by no means a vindication of religion as a whole. He made a point to differentiate between what he called religious practices and cultural practices, with religious ones being those more likely to have doubtful supernatural rationales (like using prayer to contact a deity for favors) and cultural ones having more practical justifications (like using ritual to foster connection and self-control).
While I can see Mr. Pinker's point - and I agree with him that religion as a whole must be judged by its full set of positive and negative effects - the dividing line between cultural and religious can be blurry. The Jewish practice of Shabbat, for instance, stems from a divine command for a day of rest and includes ritualistic actions and prayers. But it's also a cultural practice in which people take time out from the daily grind to focus on family, friends and other things that matter more than work.
My purpose here isn't to argue that religion is inherently good or bad. As with most social institutions, its value depends on the intentions of those using it. But even in cases where religion has been used to foment intergroup conflict, to justify invidious social hierarchies or to encourage the maintenance of false beliefs, studying how it manages to leverage the mechanisms of the mind to accomplish those nefarious goals can offer insights about ourselves - insights that could be used to understand and then combat such abuses in the future, whether perpetrated by religious or secular powers.
Science and religion do not need each other to function, but that doesn't imply that they can't benefit from each other. Rabbi Geoffrey Mitelman, the founding director of Sinai and Synapses, an organization that seeks to bridge the scientific and religious worlds, told me recently that science can help clergy better aid those they counsel by showing which types of social and behavioral practices are empirically most likely to foster their emotional, moral and spiritual goals.
A yearning for a science-religion synergy is growing in some circles. Ms. Tippett cites as an example the Formation Project, an initiative designed by a group of millennials who are looking to cultivate their inner lives and form a community by combining ideas from psychology and neuroscience with practices from ancient spiritual traditions. In doing this, she points out, these young people are not blindly accepting any doctrine. They are asking questions and choosing what works based on evidence. In short, they are doing exactly what I think the communities of scientists and clergy need to do in a more rigorous way and on a much larger scale.
Will it work? That's an empirical question. But if we choose not to investigate it, we'll never know. And I suspect we'll be the poorer for it.

Texto completo: When Phyllis Schlafly crusaded against the Equal Rights Amendment in the 1970s as a threat to all-American motherhood, she handed out freshly baked bread and apple pie to state legislators. She warned of a dystopian post-E.R.A. future of women forced to enlist in the military, gay marriage, unisex toilets everywhere and homemakers driven into the workplace by husbands free to abandon them.
The E.R.A., which had been sailing to ratification, failed. Yet gay marriage is now the law. Women in the military see combat, although women are not required to register for the draft. Six women -- so far -- are running for president. A record-shattering number of women have claimed seats in Congress. And the percentage of prime-working-age women participating in the labor force has soared from 51 percent in 1972, when Congress passed the E.R.A., to more than 75 percent last year.
So what protections did American women earn without a constitutional amendment? Did the country get everywhere the people pushing for the amendment wanted it to go? These questions, once theoretical, are newly relevant with a push to revive the Equal Rights Amendment. It was left for dead in 1982, when three states failed to ratify it by a congressionally imposed deadline, leaving it short of the necessary two-thirds of the states needed for ratification. But in the past two years, Nevada and Illinois have ratified the amendment. In Virginia, campaigners are pushing the state to ratify the amendment before the legislative session ends on Feb. 23, though ratification is a long shot.
Mrs. Schlafly may not have been able to prevent social changes that transformed the lives of American women, but she did drive a wedge between conservatives and liberals that remains today. "She was one of the early architects of class conflict as expressed through culture wars, as a way to stop the progress of the equality ideals of the professional management elite," said Joan C. Williams, a feminist legal scholar skeptical about the usefulness of the Equal Rights Amendment. "One of the ironic messages of the E.R.A. is not to underestimate the power of 'bathroom anxiety' in pushing the country to the right."
Some of the very arguments Mrs. Schlafly deployed decades ago resurfaced in the recent state legislature debates. In Nevada, Illinois and Virginia, conservative women denounced the amendment. Women already have equal rights, and an amendment would take away remaining privileges, they argued. It would make it illegal to separate the sexes in bathrooms, college dormitories or school sports, they claimed. Women would lose programs like food subsidies aimed at mothers and female-only scholarships.
What the E.R.A. would change and what it would not is both bitterly contested and hypothetical. During the 1970s and 80s, a determined corps of lawyers led by Ruth Bader Ginsburg persuaded the Supreme Court to extend the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment to cover many forms of sex discrimination. After the E.R.A. stalled, legislators passed a bevy of new laws. Together, these had the effect of opening new doors for women.
But advocates point to gaps in existing laws and Supreme Court decisions that have limited enforcement, particularly in the areas of violence against women, sexual harassment and equal pay.
Justice Ginsburg, speaking at the Aspen Institute in 2017, said that while women had come "almost as far" under the 14th Amendment as they would have under the E.R.A., she still believed an amendment had practical and symbolic value. "I would like to be able to take out my pocket Constitution and say that the equal citizenship stature of men and women is a fundamental tenet of our society like free speech," she said.
Catharine A. MacKinnon, whose legal theories laid the basis for sexual harassment being defined as a form of sex discrimination, has championed the revival of the amendment as a weapon against what she sees as the continuing subordination of women through sexual violence and economic inequality. "You go after sexuality and economics, you've gone to the heart of misogyny," she said.
The Violence Against Women Act, passed in 1994, originally allowed women to sue their attackers in federal court. This was an important provision because of wide variations in the way states prosecuted rape and sexual violence cases, said Erwin Chemerinsky, the dean of the University of California, Berkeley, law school. The Supreme Court struck down that part of the law in 2000. Many laws against discrimination, including the Civil Rights Act, are based on Congress's power to regulate interstate commerce, but the court ruled that did not apply in cases of sexual violence. This would change with an equal rights amendment, he said.
Attempts to remedy the persistent pay gap between men and women have also fallen short because of rulings saying that gaps must be the result of intentional discrimination in order to violate the law and that many differences in pay are the result of factors "other than sex," advocates say. If a woman doing the same work as a man is hired at a lower salary because her previous salary was lower, courts have ruled that is not pay discrimination, said Jessica Neuwirth, a co-founder of the E.R.A. Coalition. She believes an equal rights amendment would strengthen Congress's ability to remedy unequal pay.
The E.R.A. was a touchstone of cultural anxiety when it first ran aground. If the move to renew it gained real traction, would it affect today's most bitterly fought culture wars?
That, like so many things, depends on the conservative-liberal balance of the Supreme Court. Laws that restrict reproductive freedom obviously have a disparate impact on women, Mr. Chemerinsky said, but the court would have to decide whether such laws amount to discrimination on the basis of sex.
And our understanding of gender has changed in ways unimagined either by the suffragists who first drafted an equal rights amendment when women won the vote a century ago or the backers of the E.R.A. a half-century later. A real push for this amendment now might affect the treatment of trans people and who is legally seen as a man or a woman.
Ms. Williams, the legal scholar, believes the conservative tenor of the current court means justices would choose the narrowest interpretations of an equal rights amendment. Transformative change would be out of reach. Ms. Neuwirth argues just the opposite.
"It's almost more important in times like these to have very explicit constitutional language," she said. "If the law says no discrimination on the basis of sex, then no matter what your legal ideology as a judge, the more concrete the language is, the better off people are going to be."

Texto completo: Doug Adler's long nightmare is finally over.
After two years of living hell, the tennis broadcaster who was falsely accused of racism finally cleared his name last week. This despite what has become all too common on Twitter: a rush-to-judgment mob mentality.
While an ESPN tennis analyst at the Australian Open in January 2017, as all-time great Venus Williams charged the net, Adler observed that she was using what is known in tennis as "the guerrilla effect," as in guerrilla warfare, where sudden ambushes occur.
Viewers unfamiliar with the term "guerrilla" went crazy, hopping on Twitter to express their outrage - how dare he call Williams a gorilla! Tweets included, "My jaw dropped when I heard this! Disgusting!"
As the unfortunate tweets about the word "guerrilla" piled up, ESPN panicked. And when it was learned that one of the clueless tweets was a New York Times freelancer, Adler was toast (not breakfast toast, but ... never mind).
ESPN threatened to fire Adler unless he apologized for something he didn't do, and when he did apologize, the network fired him anyway. Didn't he make a racist comment?
Uhm, no. He was using a homonym (and no, I am not attacking gay people). Homonyms are words that sound alike but have different meanings. A spouse on the phone describing the dinner his or her partner cooked as "It was fowl" might want to phrase it another way to avoid having a dish thrown at him or her.
What is foul is that Adler's life for two years has been a nightmare.
Adler sued ESPN for wrongful termination on Feb. 14, 2017. Last week, ESPN finally settled the lawsuit and rehired Adler. But in the interim, the stress and abuse he experienced took their toll. According to tennis.life, he suffered emotional and physical issues, including a heart attack.
In his book "The Death of Expertise," national security expert Tom Nichols says we have become "proud of not knowing things. Americans have reached a point where ignorance ... is [considered] an actual virtue." It wasn't for Adler.
Meanwhile, ESPN executives tried to keep the settlement with Adler low key. Maybe ESPN was embarrassed.
Or maybe executives at ESPN know that the truth doesn't matter anymore?

Texto completo: FEMA chief resigns: WASHINGTON — Brock Long , the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, resigned Wednesday after a two-year tenure in which he managed the response to historic wildfires and major hurricanes but was dogged by questions over his use of government vehicles.
7 accuse Ryan Adams of abuse: NEW YORK — A New York Times report says seven women have claimed singer-songwriter Ryan Adams offered to help them with their music careers but then turned things sexual, and he sometimes became emotional and verbally abusive. In the story published Wednesday, a 20-year-old female musician said Adams, 44, had inappropriate conversations with her while she was 15 and 16. Identified by her middle name Ava, she said that Adams exposed himself during a video call.
LaRouche Jr. dies at 96: Often described as an extremist crank and fringe figure, Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr. cut a shadowy and alarming path through American politics for a half-century. He built a political organization often likened to a cult and ran for president eight times, once while in prison for mail fraud. In recent decades, he operated from a heavily guarded compound near Leesburg, Virginia. LaRouche, who built a worldwide following based on conspiracy theories, economic doom, anti-Semitism, homophobia and racism, died Tuesday. He was 96.
200 ISIS fighters surrender: AL-OMAR OIL FIELD BASE, Syria — Activists report that 200 Islamic State group militants, many of them foreigners, surrendered to U.S.-backed fighters in eastern Syria on Wednesday, bringing the Kurdish-led force closer to taking full control of the last remaining area controlled by the extremists, a Kurdish official and activists said.
New Jersey lists cleric names: NEWARK, N.J. — New Jersey’s five Roman Catholic dioceses listed more than 180 priests Wednesday who have been credibly accused of sexually abusing minors over a span of several decades, joining more than two dozen other states that have named suspected abusers. The lists released Wednesday identified priests and deacons who served in the dioceses of Camden, Trenton, Metuchen and Paterson and the archdiocese of Newark.
Trump installs golf simulator: WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump has installed a room-sized "golf simulator" game at the White House, which allows him to play virtual rounds at courses all over the world by hitting a ball into a large video screen, according to two people told about the system.
Iran suicide bomber kills 27: TEHRAN, Iran — A suicide car bomber claimed by an al-Qaida-linked group attacked a bus carrying members of Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guard paramilitary force Wednesday, killing at least 27 people and wounding 13 others, state media reported.
Reservation deaths scrutinized: ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — Lawmakers in at least seven states have introduced legislation to address the unsolved deaths and disappearances of numerous Native American women and girls.

Sleazy journalism can serve the public good

Texto completo: There are plenty of reasons to sympathize with Jeff Bezos in his battle with the National Enquirer. If true, the accusations of blackmail brought by the billionaire founder of Amazon would be just the latest outrage from the tabloid, which has made a specialty of scabrous reporting, and ethically questionable tactics and techniques.
But that doesn't mean we should always applaud the campaigns of powerful moguls to silence sleazy newspapers. History shows that even the most odious publications and the worst practices of scandal sheets can inadvertently play an important role in maintaining the freedom of the press. There's no better illustration than the sordid story of the Saturday Press.
In the early 20th century, hundreds if not thousands of small, local newspapers began imitating the yellow journalism style pioneered by William Randolph Hearst. These papers, most of them small-time weeklies, wallowed in the gutter. They viciously attacked minorities; they also published lurid stories of sex and crime as well as what one historian has described as "grossly exaggerated accounts of malfeasance by public officials."
The editors displayed a brazen disregard for journalistic ethics, creating entirely bogus stories or hyping more modest scandals with salacious details. Then, copy in hand, they would approach the person they implicated in funny business, threatening to go public unless the victim made it worth their while to stay silent. Most victims acceded to editorial demands: Extortion was difficult to prove in court.
Among the editors accused of this practice was a miscreant from Minnesota named Howard Guilford, who had a hand in several scandal sheets. It's little surprise that the wealthy and powerful hated Guilford, and they may have been behind trumped-up accusations of counterfeiting and other crimes leveled against him. More credible, though, were multiple charges of libel and extortion, though he was only found guilty on a couple of occasions.
In 1915, Guilford published the Twin City Reporter, a paper that trafficked in sex, and attacks on the wealthy and powerful, but also went after the Salvation Army, the Catholic Church and other institutions. In addition, it aimed a constant stream of epithets and invective against minority groups.
The Twin City Reporter eventually went under, but Guilford joined up with another lowlife named Jay Near a decade later to publish the Saturday Press in Minneapolis. In the first issue, the duo claimed: "No blackmail ever dirtied our hands although we are aware that the taint of blackmail sullies our reputations."
With that out of the way, they promised to clean up the city, which was, by almost universal assent, one of the most corrupt in the country, thanks to bootlegging and other forms of organized crime. Guilford and Near wasted no time, immediately accusing the police, the mayor and the county district attorney, Floyd Olson, of corruption.
These charges were accompanied by rank anti-Semitism.
"There have been too many men in this city who have been taking orders from JEW GANGSTERS ... Therefore we have Jew gangsters practically ruling Minneapolis. It is Jew thugs who have 'pulled' practically every robbery in this city ... Practically every vendor of vile hooch, every owner of a moonshine still, every snake-faced gangster and embryonic yegg (a safecracker) in the Twin Cities is a JEW."
Minnesota's legislature had passed a measure called the Public Nuisance Abatement Law a few years earlier. This statute, which took direct aim at scandal sheets, used the "prior restraint" doctrine to empower the state to suppress newspapers deemed "malicious, scandalous, and defamatory." This perfectly captured the editorial line of the Saturday Press.
After the paper called Olson a "Jew lover," the district attorney filed suit under the law, shutting it down for defaming the Jewish community, the police and just about everyone else of importance in the Twin Cities. After a jury found the paper guilty of the charge, Guilford abandoned the cause. But Near took the case to the state Supreme Court, arguing that the state law infringed on the freedom of the press.
Near's attorney made a novel, if honest, argument: "Every person does have a constitutional right to publish malicious, scandalous, and defamatory matter, though untrue, and with bad motives, and for unjustifiable ends." The state, he argued, could not quash such stupidity in advance; it could only prosecute the newspaper after the fact.
Chief Justice Samuel B. Wilson, writing in the majority opinion, didn't buy it: "No agency can hush the sincere and honest voice of the press; but our Constitution was never intended to protect malice, scandal, and defamation, when untrue or published without justifiable ends."
The court ruled against Near and ordered the Saturday Press shuttered for the foreseeable future.
But by this time, other newspapers, most notably the Chicago Tribune, decided to lend their support to Near -- not because they admired him, but because they believed a deeper issue was at stake. Col. Robert R. McCormick, the Tribune's publisher, had already been sued by the city of Chicago for libel. He had won that suit; now he hoped to help Near win his legal battle too.
From late 1929 to 1931, the case rolled toward the U.S. Supreme Court, underwritten by McCormick and the American Newspaper Publishers Association. In June 1931, the Supreme Court handed down a narrow, 5-4 decision in favor of Near and declared the Minnesota statute unconstitutional.
The four conservative judges dissenting in the case focused on the fact that Guilford and Near had been disreputable, anti-Semitic rabble-rousers for many years. The judges lambasted the duo's earlier "criminal" partnership at the Twin City Reporter, and argued that the law that had closed their subsequent collaboration at the Saturday Press was an appropriate response to publishers who "contrive and put into effect a scheme or program for oppression, blackmail or extortion."
Chief Justice Charles Evan Hughes, writing for the majority, ignored the indefensible character of Guilford and Near, as well as the assertion that Olson may have in fact enjoyed an "impeccable" reputation prior to the attacks on his character. A bigger question was at stake: "The fact that liberty of the press can be abused does not make less necessary the immunity of the press from previous restraint."
The case became a landmark decision that established new, expansive definitions of freedom of the press. It has since become the basis of important decisions that have nothing to do with the rants of a couple of Minnesota anti-Semites. When The New York Times fought an attempt to halt the publication of the Pentagon Papers, for example, Near v. Minnesota played a starring role, buttressing its case.
Which brings us back to the National Enquirer. At the moment, the issues in the Bezos imbroglio look pretty pedestrian. But should the billionaire pursue a legal case on the grounds of privacy or libel law, courts will rule in ways that could have profound implications for the freedom of the press down the line.

Diocese Says Its Students Didn't Incite Protesters

Texto completo: The Roman Catholic bishop of Covington, Ky., released an investigative report on Wednesday that he said showed a group of high school students from his diocese "did not instigate" a widely publicized encounter with a Native American man outside the Lincoln Memorial last month.
"Our students were placed in a situation that was at once bizarre and even threatening," the bishop, Roger J. Foys, said in a statement with the report. "Their reaction to the situation was, given the circumstances, expected and one might even say laudatory."
Bishop Foys said the report realized his hope that an investigation would "exonerate" the students.
The diocese hired a private detective agency that developed a detailed account of an encounter that was captured on video and quickly became a lightning rod for political and racial tensions in America.
The mostly white students, many of them wearing "Make America Great Again" gear, were in Washington on Jan. 18 to attend an anti-abortion March for Life rally when they intersected with a Native American man, Nathan Phillips, and others from an Indigenous Peoples March. Nearby, a group of black Hebrew Israelites were shouting slurs at the boys and Native Americans on the scene.
Covington Catholic High School and the diocese, along with a chorus of political commentators, had at first condemned the behavior of the students after a short clip spread rapidly on social media that showed an apparent standoff between Mr. Phillips and an unidentified teenager in a MAGA hat. The diocese even said the students could face expulsion.
But within a day, longer videos began to circulate that showed a more complicated scene at the memorial, and supporters of President Trump rallied to their side.
Through a public relations firm, the teenager in the MAGA hat put out a statement identifying himself as Nick Sandmann and stating that he had been confused by the encounter and had been trying to avoid conflict.
Bishop Foys later apologized for rushing to judgment, telling parents in a letter, "We should not have allowed ourselves to be bullied and pressured into making a statement prematurely."
The agency hired by the diocese, Greater Cincinnati Investigation, said it had spent about 240 hours on the investigation, including examining online video and interviewing 43 students and 13 adult chaperones, including educators and parents. Investigators could not reach Mr. Phillips for an interview, despite traveling to his home in Michigan, and had to rely on Mr. Sandmann's written statement, according to the final report.
Among the findings:
When Mr. Phillips approached the students, students told investigators, they thought he was coming to join in their school cheers, which they had begun to drown out "offensive statements" by the Hebrew Israelites. "None of the students felt threatened by Mr. Phillips and many stated they were 'confused,"' the report said.
Investigators found "no evidence of offensive or racist statements by students to Mr. Phillips or members of his group." But the report said some "joined in" with his chanting and some performed a "tomahawk chop."
Some boys said a chaperone warned them they would face detention "if they engaged in a verbal exchange" with the Hebrew Israelites.
Most students bought their "Make America Great Again" apparel while in Washington. In past years, chaperones said, some students had bought "Hope" hats in support of President Barack Obama. Investigators said there was no school policy prohibiting political apparel on school trips.
Investigators did not find evidence that the students chanted about building a wall at the border with Mexico, as Mr. Phillips had said.
"The immediate worldwide reaction to the initial video led almost everyone to believe that our students had initiated the incident and the perception of those few minutes of video became reality," Bishop Foys wrote.
L. Lin Wood, a lawyer for Mr. Sandmann, said the report released by the diocese confirmed the truth of the teenager's account. Lawyers for Mr. Sandmann have pledged to examine the actions of the school, diocese, various commentators and news organizations, including The New York Times.
"Every member of the mainstream and social media mob who falsely attacked, disparaged, or threatened this 16-year-old boy should hang their heads in shame and be held fully accountable in a court of law for their wrongdoing," Mr. Wood said in an email.
Mr. Phillips could not be reached for comment about the report, which said there were inconsistencies in his accounts of what happened.
On Wednesday, Chase Iron Eyes, a spokesman for the Indigenous Peoples Movement, which organized the march, criticized the investigation as showing "a serious lack of understanding about the intrinsic, racist culture" in the United States.
"We feel that our elder is vindicated by the videos that are out there right now," he said. "We would expect the adults that are responsible for these children to take responsibility for the racism, or ignorance, that is represented by their children doing the tomahawk chop."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: Have you seen Donald Glover? Also goes by the name of Childish Gambino. Recently seen sporting a blond beard.
The multi-hyphenate artist was nominated for five Grammy awards and won four of them. Not just any four though, the rapper won awards for Best Music Video, Song of the Year, Best Rap/Sung Performance and Record of the Year, for "This Is America. " According to Billboard, it was the first rap song to win Record of the Year and Song of the Year.
It was a huge history-making night for Glover, and everyone was there to witness it except for the man of the hour himself. According to Pitchfork, the last time an artist won any of the big four awards (song, record and album of the year plus best new artist) and wasn't present to accept was Amy Winehouse at the 2007 Grammys, because of a denied visa. But even she was buzzed in via satellite to accept the awards herself.

The 35-year-old rapper, who is also a comedian, was nowhere to be found on Grammy Sunday even though he was spotted just a couple days prior at Ludwig Göransson's pre-Grammy party on Thursday. He was even pictured debuting his new blond beard. Maybe this was all a joke? Or a statement like the one he made with the "This is America" video?
If it was a joke, no one was in on it.
Göransson, who co-wrote "This is America," accepted the award but when asked by reporters where Glover was, even he had no idea.
"I haven’t talked to him yet, but I’m going to call him after the award show, and I’m sure we’re going to have a little conversation,” Göransson told reporters following the win.
The rest of the "This is America" team who talked to reporters backstage also had no idea.
Riley Mackin, who also worked on the song, said he's not sure where Glover was either.
"The last time I've seen him was a couple days ago, and he walked out and I haven't seen him since," Mackin told reporters. "I think anything Donald does is a little strange. "
Glover declined a performance spot for the Grammys, producer Ken Ehrlich told The New York Times.
USA TODAY has reached out to Glover's representatives to see if they know where he is — no word yet.

With Grammys, producer walks a tightrope

Texto completo: In the age of social media and real-time Internet reaction, it's trickier than ever to pull off a live awards show.
For longtime Grammy Awards producer Ken Ehrlich, the new era has created a balancing act — generating the sort of watercooler moments that can light up Twitter while heeding the musical mission at the heart of the Grammys.
"The tightrope you walk is: Are you doing it because you want to hit virally? Do you want the headlines? Do you want people to be talking about, 'Should Shawn Mendes be sitting next to Camila Cabello'?" Ehrlich said. "I'd like to think that the field we play in is still musically rooted. And it probably doesn't always wind up that way — I'll be the first to admit that."
Ehrlich, a Cleveland native, has captained the Grammy production since 1980, a familiar figure with his headset and calm, twinkling-eyed demeanor. He'll do it again Sunday at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, where "The 61st Grammy Awards," airing at 8 p.m. on CBS, will feature performers including Lady Gaga, Cardi B, Katy Perry and Diana Ross, and a nominees list led by Kendrick Lamar (eight), Drake (seven) and Brandi Carlile (six).
One act who won't be performing Sunday night is four-time nominee Greta Van Fleet. The Michigan band had been in consideration for a live slot — Ehrlich even met with the group in December — but isn't on the bill.
For all the changes in popular culture and the broadcast itself, Ehrlich said one plank of his approach hasn't budged: the idea that there's a cross-generational connective tissue to music — "where it was, where it is, where it's going," he said.
"The definition of the show is to celebrate and recognize musical achievements of the past year. So as (the musical landscape) changes, we change with it. There are people who would say we haven't changed enough," he said. "But I've always believed these things don't exist in a vacuum. I can't do Post Malone before sitting with him and having him tell me some of his influences, the artists who have meant something to him."
And so you get Post Malone with the Red Hot Chili Peppers on Sunday night, the latest offbeat Grammy mashup arranged by Ehrlich.
Another big Grammy shift in recent years has been an emphasis on performances with social relevance, something close to the heart of a TV veteran who calls himself a child of the '60s.
"The world has changed," Ehrlich said. "There's no reason our show shouldn't be a part of that."
Think Kendrick Lamar's fiery, theatrical message on criminal-justice reform in 2016, or Katy Perry's highlighting of rape and domestic-violence issues in 2015. Or the 33 couples, including gay and lesbian partners, who wed during Macklemore's performance of "Same Love" in 2014.
"We're reflecting what the artistic community is feeling, to the point where there have been a couple of times we've been criticized for going over the edge," Ehrlich said. "But I think it's become such a touchstone — the way artists perceive who they are and what they do — that I want my show to be part of it. You don't see it on other shows — or if you do, they go to the dark side and it's marketing."
The producer is accustomed to his show being a lightning rod for controversy, but this week it was Ehrlich himself who wound up on the firing line. Following remarks to the Associated Press that Ariana Grande wouldn't be performing because "she felt it was too late for her to pull something together," the pop star shot back via Twitter.
Grande accused the veteran Grammy producer of "lying about me," saying she pulled out because "my creativity & self expression was stifled by (Ehrlich)."
(The Free Press conducted this interview with Ehrlich in January, and was unable to receive follow-up comment after the Grande brouhaha.)
The 25-year-old singer isn't the only one opting out of the Grammy show: The New York Times reported Thursday that Drake, Kendrick Lamar and Childish Gambino declined offers to perform — possibly a response to the perceived snub of hip-hop nominees through the years.
When Ehrlich came aboard in 1980, the Grammys faced competition from just a handful of music award shows. That field has expanded quite a bit since, but Ehrlich said his mission is the same: separating the Grammys from the pack.
These days, that might even mean including "artists that I don't necessarily believe have great voices or make great music, but the spectacle is there," he said.
"This is in no way directed at hip-hop," he added. "I think some of the most relevant, cultural, artistic, musical statements are being made by hip-hop artists. And that's what we gravitate toward there. I'd much rather go that direction with a Kendrick or a Childish Gambino or even a Cardi B — where it is spectacle, but man, it's thoughtful. That, to me, is much more resonant with my audience ... than 2 Chainz."
While the Grammy Awards ostensibly set out to honor recorded music — this is the Recording Academy's event, after all — Ehrlich knows his mission is to create compelling television.
"This is going to sound really bad: Steely Dan can make the greatest record in the world, but I've just never figured out a way to make a 41/2-minute (Steely Dan performance) work on television," Ehrlich said. "I love their records. I can sit there in an artificial or regular state and get a kick out of it. But man, I've got to get these people (in the audience) to stand up. And I've got to get 20-plus million people at home to stay with it and not say, 'I wonder what channel "Law & Order" is on right now.'"

Texto completo: A second woman came forward Friday to accuse Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax of sexual assault, alleging he raped her in 2000 while they were students at Duke University.
The revelation prompted several calls for the lieutenant governor to resign, with one Virginia delegate saying he would introduce articles of impeachment for Fairfax on Monday.
Fairfax, in a statement, denied the woman's allegation.
"It is demonstrably false," Fairfax said. "I have never forced myself on anyone ever."
Meredith Watson released details of the alleged assault through a statement from her attorney, Nancy Erika Smith.
The statement said that Watson shared her account of the assault with friends in a series of emails and Facebook messages. Watson also "immediately" told friends that Fairfax had raped her, Smith said.
"Mr. Fairfax's attack was premeditated and aggressive," the statement reads. "The two were friends but never dated or had any romantic relationship."
"At this time, Ms. Watson is reluctantly coming forward out of a strong sense of civic duty and her belief that those seeking or serving in public office should be of the highest character," Smith said in a statement Friday.
"She has no interest in becoming a media personality or reliving the trauma that has greatly affected her life. Similarly, she is not seeking any financial damages."
Watson wants Fairfax to resign from office, Smith said.
Later Friday night, Smith released a second statement in response to what she said was an attempt by Fairfax to discredit Watson.
"We have heard from numerous press sources that ... Mr. Fairfax has chosen to attack his victim again, now smearing her with the typical 'she's nuts' defense," Smith wrote. "He revealed that Ms. Watson was the victim of a prior rape. She was."
The statement goes on to claim that Watson was raped during her sophomore year at Duke.
Smith asserted that Fairfax, knowing of the prior rape, said to Watson, "I knew that because of what happened to you last year, you'd be too afraid to say anything."
Asking for an investigation, Fairfax called Watson's account "unsubstantiated and false allegations."
"I will clear my good name and I have nothing to hide," Fairfax said in his statement. "I have passed two full field background checks by the FBI and run for office in two highly contested elections with nothing like this being raised before."
He called the accusation a "vicious and coordinated smear campaign" being orchestrated against him.
"I will not resign," he said.
A friend who attended Duke with Watson recalled how Watson came to her crying in the spring of 2000, The Washington Post reported. The friend, Kaneedreck Adams, who is now an attorney, lived across from Watson in a campus apartment.
"She was upset," Adams said. "She told me she had been raped and she named Justin."
The alleged attack took place at a fraternity house, the Post reported.
The Post also included an email exchange between Watson and another friend from Duke from two years ago in which Watson wrote about the assault.
The Republican Party of Virginia on Friday afternoon called for an investigation of the new allegations and a number of current and former Virginia lawmakers said Fairfax needs to resign.
"The allegations against Justin Fairfax are serious and credible," said former Gov. Terry McAuliffe on Twitter. "It is clear to me that he can no longer effectively serve the people of Virginia as Lieutenant Governor."
Del. Patrick Hope, a Democrat from Arlington, said on Twitter that he plans to introduce the articles of impeachment on Monday - unless Fairfax has stepped down by then.
Reached Friday night by phone, Hope said that reading Tyson's account was painful. It's when he saw Watson's statement that he started thinking about impeachment.
"Just seeing the second (accusation) come out, even though we had been told there was no one else coming out, tells me this is a pattern of behavior unfit for office," Hope said.
U.S. Reps. Elaine Luria, Abigail Spanberger, Jennifer Wexton, Don Beyer and Gerry Connolly - all from Virginia - issued a joint statement saying Watson's statement lends further credence to the account provided by Vanessa Tyson, who has accused Fairfax of sexually assaulting her 15 years ago.
"The Lieutenant Governor of Virginia presides over the Virginia Senate and must be prepared to fill the role of Governor," the group wrote in their statement. "It is unacceptable that either of these weighty responsibilities be entrusted to someone who has engaged in the behavior described by Dr. Tyson and Meredith Watson."
Senate Republican leaders called for police investigations in North Carolina and Massachusetts following the accusations from Watson and Tyson. The statute of limitations in Massachusetts for sexual assault is 15 years. The Democratic National Convention was held from July 26-29 in 2004.
"We are shocked and dismayed by these credible and serious allegations," the leaders wrote in a joint statement.
House and Senate Democrats also called for Fairfax's resignation, saying "the time has come for him to step down."
Watson's account comes on the heels of a lengthy statement from Tyson, who has said she met Fairfax in Boston at the Democratic National Convention in 2004. It was there that he sexually assaulted her in his hotel room, she said.
In an article published Friday, The New York Times reported Tyson told five friends about the assault in different degrees of detail over the past two years.
Three of those people told the newspaper that Tyson, a professor at Scripps College in Claremont, Calif., identified her attacker to the people as Justin Fairfax, a lieutenant governor or a politician on the rise, according to the report.
According to the Times, Tyson told a number of colleagues during a lunch group last fall that she had been sexually assaulted years earlier. She told the group during the start of a fellowship at Stanford.
Tyson told them about having been blindsided by her assailant, the Times reported, quoting Elizabeth A. Armstrong, a professor of sociology at the University of Michigan.
"What she told us was pretty much exactly what was in the statement that she released but with vastly less detail," Armstrong told the newspaper.
Watson's attorney on Friday released an email exchange to the Post between Watson and a friend at Duke. In the 2016 exchange, the friend, Milagros Joye Brown, was inviting a group of friends from Duke to a fundraiser for Fairfax as he started his campaign for lieutenant governor.
"Molly, Justin raped me in college and I don't want to hear anything about him. Please, please, please remove me from any future emails about him please," Watson wrote on Oct. 26, 2016.

Sally Field wraps up Rancho Mirage Writers Festival

Texto completo: Sally Field wrapped the Rancho Mirage Writers Festival last week like a boxer offering condolences to an opponent she had just pummeled.
"Thank you for letting me beat you up," the petite, two-time Oscar-winning actress told festival founder Jamie Kabler at the Rancho Mirage Public Library after doing a Q&A with Kabler, like Ginger Rogers trying to lead Fred Astaire.
Field said everything she needed to say in a 45-minute talk about her 2018 memoir, "In Pieces," but she probably could have accomplished it just as effectively dancing backwards in high heels with Kabler asking more leading questions.
Kabler began the last event of the three-day festival by asking Field about her performance as Mary Lincoln in the 2012 film, "Lincoln," for which she was nominated for a Best Supporting Actress Oscar.
Field responded, "Wow. How do we even begin there? That's like the end."
Field had an orderly arrangement to her book.
She had re-discovered her passion for acting, she said, while making "Lincoln," as her mother was dying, and while Field was seeing a therapist who helped her identify the many uncomfortable, if not dysfunctional pieces of her life. That confluence was the climax of her book, and she was thrown starting the Q&A at that point.
So, she offered a few choice comments about Kabler's moderating skills.
"What an odd question," she remarked after Kabler asked her why she made "Smokey and the Bandit" with her then-boyfriend, Burt Reynolds.
"You could have said 'unique'," Kabler retorted, before adding, "I'm moving on to the next question."
Berger, one of Kabler's many friends in the audience, whispered to another festival-goer, "Tough interview."
But Kabler did get in some questions that weren't about Field's book, and one resulted in one of the most interesting exchanges of the Q&A. Kabler asked Field about her TV show, "Brothers & Sisters," in which she starred from 2006 to 2011 as the mother of a gay son who appeared to be "an all-American kid."
In real life, Field said, her own son is a gay man who appeared to be "an all-American kid," and she struggled to let her son find his own path. She was able to help write some of the TV show from personal experience, Field said, "So, 'Brothers & Sisters' was really important for me for that."
The few jabs and stumbles during the Field Q&A were among the very few bumps and bruises Kabler and his crew, including festival executive director Debbie Green and Rancho Mirage Library Director Aaron Espinosa, experienced all week.
Tickets for the three-day event, which began Jan. 30, sold out in three hours almost a year ago and, after five previous festivals, customer service went arguably smoother than ever. Fans and speakers alike raved about the lineup and the conversation that engaged rooms full of audiences in the library from 8:30 a.m. to mid-afternoon each day.
It's almost a bromide to say the latest event is better than the ones that came before, but even Kabler echoed that the fans said exactly that with conviction this week.
"We opened with Tom Hanks, we closed with Sally Field, we had (former California) Gov. Jerry Brown interviewed on Thursday by Maureen Dowd of the New York Times," Kabler said after the last Q&A. "Within two weeks after the last festival, I made several calls. I saw it line up. It just happened to come together in November with Tom, with Sally and then Gov. Brown."
Former Sen. Barbara Boxer, who regularly attends this festival, joined former California Gov. Gray Davis for a conversation on "The State of the State," moderated by Brown's brother-in-law, former CBS and Fox News president Van Gordon Sauter. They discussed the need to protect the middle class after housing prices have gone up by 100 percent, college tuition has increased by more than 100 percent, and health care costs have risen by at least 60 percent since the 1980s while wages have risen just 5 percent.
Boxer said these kind of substantive conversations are typical of the festival.
"What I love about the festival is that Jamie attracts really, truly the best and the brightest people out there, from historians to novelists to non-fiction writers and politicians," she said. "What's so important is, the country is so divided, it's great to hear these issues discussed in a calm way and have people in the audience who are Democrats, Republicans, in the middle – I like that. I think it has a very special touch, and I think it reflects Jamie's humanity because he likes to bring us all together."
The festival only had one African-American speaker, but Boxer said she noticed more women speakers on the roster, and one festival-goer, Dee Ann Nichols, said what she liked most about all the conversations was the discussion on anti-Semitism.
Kabler said even before he could be asked about diversity that there will be more of it next year.
"I have a number of African-American writers and I'm very proud of that," he said. "I have Zadie Smith (a British novelist of Jamaican descent) coming. I have a Nigerian writer. I have a conservative young college student who fought for conservative speakers on college campuses, Zachary Wood."
This year's theme was a remembrance of World War II in celebration of the 75th anniversary of D-Day coming June 6. New York Times columnist Bret Stephens suggested a theme of great wars, Kabler said on the preview night with Stephens sitting in the front row, but author Susan Eisenhower said that was too broad a topic and he should just focus on World War II.
Next year's festival will again feature a substantive political dialogue.
"Next year, our theme is Americans and Presidential Elections because our festival is in January of a presidential election year," Kabler said. "It also (will be) the 100th anniversary of women's (voting) rights. So we're going to have a lot more women writers."
Tickets are scheduled to go on sale March 1 at rmwritersfest.org.

How congressional Democrats could fight a Trump wall national emergency declaration

Texto completo: After Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast in 2005, President George W. Bush declared a national emergency to do something Republicans had long wanted to do anyway: He suspended prevailing wage laws on federal contracts to rebuild the region.
Labor unions protested. Democrats signed on to a bill to rewrite the law. Even dozens of moderate Republicans asked Bush to reconsider.
But then a single congressman used a parliamentary maneuver – never attempted before or since – to challenge the underpinnings of the national emergency itself.
Bush backed down without even a vote.

The largely forgotten story of Bush's capitulation explains why Republicans have advised President Donald Trump against bypassing Congress and invoking a national emergency to build a wall along the Mexican border.
In addition to raising legal questions – such a move would inevitably be challenged in court – a declaration would invite Congress to exercise its long-dormant power to revoke national emergencies.
And all it would take is one member of Congress to force the issue.
In 2005, that member was Rep. George Miller, a California lawmaker who was the top Democrat on the House Education and Labor Committee.
Calling Bush's decision "callous and misguided," Miller's first move was to try to amend the Davis-Bacon Act of 1931. That law sets the prevailing wage for federal contracts, but allows the president to grant waivers in times of national emergency.
But Democrats were in the minority, and while some Republicans were grumbling about Bush's move, they were unwilling to sign on to Miller's legislation – meaning it would never get to the House floor.

So Miller changed tack. He dug up the National Emergencies Act of 1975, one in a series of post-Watergate reforms. It allowed Congress to terminate a presidential emergency by simple majority vote.
Republican leadership couldn't block the vote: Under the law, they had 15 business days to bring it out of committee and to the floor.
Miller introduced his resolution on Oct. 20, and a vote was scheduled for Nov. 8.
On Oct 26, the Bush administration announced it would terminate the emergency effective Nov. 7.
Bush Labor Secretary Elaine Chao said the administration had reexamined the issue and discovered that it wouldn't save as much money as initially forecast. (Chao remains a power in Washington: She's now Trump's transportation secretary, and her husband is Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. )
Miller declared victory.
"Let me be clear," he told the New York Times. "The president is backing down today only because he had no other choice. "
Mark Zuckerman, who was the Democratic staff director of the House Education and Labor at the time, says all it took was the threat of a vote.
"It can be revealing when you make people vote on something," he says.
"We thought it was an unacceptable and inappropriate use of emergency powers, but we also wanted to check to see if there was really Republican support for something like this. I think it’s part of the genius of the procedure is that it tests sentiment on Capitol Hill for your unilateral idea. "
The original intent of the 1975 law was to allow Congress a block a presidential emergency by simple majority vote. But in 1983, the U. S. Supreme Court struck down the legislative veto. So now, any joint resolution by Congress to terminate an emergency can be vetoed by the president.
And McConnell said Trump could do exactly that.
"The president could win anyway by vetoing the bill and then trying to get enough votes to sustain it, so may ultimately be able to prevail on the national emergency alternative," McConnell told Fox News on Tuesday.
Still, some GOP senators are already expressing discomfort over such a vote, and have asked Trump this week – both publicly and privately – not to put them in that position.
"It's not my preferred choice," said Sen. John Kennedy, R-La.
"I hope he doesn't do it," said. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas.
"It might be a – you know – a tough vote to win here in the Senate," said Sen. John Thune, R-S. D.
One concern is the precedent such a declaration would set.
"I think most Republicans will tell you that we really would like to find a way to avoid that type of a discussion if at all possible because this goes beyond just this president," Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S. D. , told CNN on Wednesday. "This goes on to future presidents and what they might decide to declare an emergency for. "
Special report: America's perpetual state of emergency, from Jimmy Carter to Barack Obama
That was exactly what Congress expected when it voted overwhelmingly to pass the National Emergencies Act.
The law called for every emergency to be reviewed – and possibly voted on – every six months. But in 44 years, presidents have declared at least 60 national emergencies without Congress taking a single vote.
Thirty-one of those emergencies remain in place today.

The use of emergency powers became so routine that the Obama administration said in 2015 that they were mere formalities – despite their boilerplate language that they're in response to an "unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security. " And presidents seem to have ignored requirements that they update Congress on the costs of those emergencies.
More: The Obama White House claimed that national emergencies were just formalities
Liza Goitein, director of the national security program at the Brennan Center for Justice, has advocated reforms to presidential emergency powers.
"I think Congress has woken up to the idea that the process for declaring emergencies is too permissive," she says.
"This isn’t going to look good if the Republican Senate is voting to curtail the president's power. It’s going to split Republicans and force Republicans to take a vote they don’t want to take – and it may not go Trump's way. "
Trump did not mention the national emergency in his State of the Union address Tuesday, but says he's still considering it. A national emergency could allow him to transfer unspent military construction funds toward a wall.
"I don't like to take things off the table," Trump told CBS in a pre-Super Bowl interview. "It's that alternative. It's national emergency, it's other things and, you know, there have been plenty national emergencies called. "

Texto completo: Whenever 3- or 4-year-old Katy Korby would hide in fear and tears from a thunderstorm at her grandmother’s Wright/Sauk Rapids-area home, Florence Victor would scoop up her and her older sister Jennifer and tell them a story she made up.
The storm was really a search for Baby Thunder, who went missing. The disappearance was causing a rumble as Mama and Papa Thunder, using lighting bolts as flashlights, searched the skies for their missing child. The storm ended, the late Florence Victor told her young granddaughters back then, when Baby Thunder was found and reunited with her parents.
The story, and the hugs from their grandmother, had a calming effect on the girls. It was a tale that would be passed down to the sisters’ own children.
It is also a tale that, in a small way, is trying to help families seeking asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border.
“Baby Thunder” is now a recently published children’s book written by both sisters, both longtime Como Park residents, with the help of Korby’s husband, Shawn, a Roseville-based real estate agent with a flair for illustration.
All proceeds from the book are currently going to an Arizona-based nonprofit that provides legal services to undocumented, unaccompanied children and others. Its name? The Florence Immigrant and Refugee Rights Project.
“We were looking for good organizations, and we found this one, which has the same name as our grandmother,” Katy Korby, also a real estate agent and a mother of two, explained. “It was serendipity.”
The idea for the book came during a spate of thunderstorms that passed through the Twin Cities area last June.
“At the time, there was a lot of news about the separation and detention of families at the border,” said Korby’s sister, Jennifer Victor-Larsen, an insurance underwriter and mother of two. “I woke up to booming thunder one morning and thought about the story, about parents and children separated and struggling to find each other. What was happening was not right, and I felt a need to do something.”
She texted her sister about her idea. Book it, Katy Korby replied. Victor-Larsen took it another step last month when she spent a week in Tijuana working with asylum seekers on the Mexico side of the border. Her husband, Nels, an accountant, accompanied her.
She was was taken aback by the large numbers of parents, mostly mothers, with young children ranging in ages from under 1 to up to 8-years old. She expected more single adults.
Fluent in Spanish, she heard first-hand accounts of parents trekking hundreds of miles with children in tow to escape violence or gang recruitment threats. These were not rapists, drug smugglers or murderers, she said to herself. Many of these families were given numbers before bring interviewed, many waiting weeks on the Mexico side in less than ideal conditions and braving nights were the temperatures dipped into the 40s.
“It was frustrating,” she said. “Their faces were full of anxiety. They had been through so much and now were finding out their chances (of asylum) were low and that they would be detained before finding out if they would be approved or sent back. “
Victor-Larsen returned feeling depressed and deflated at the families’ limbo-like plight.
“They are legally seeking asylum yet they are being held in detention in a (less than ideal) environment,” she added. “This is not us. If these people knocked on a Minnesotan’s door, and we here came face to face with people who have gone through these horrors, I don’t think there would be many Minnesotans who would say these people do not at least deserve a shot (at asylum or being heard),” she said. “The criminals, definitely, keep those out … ”
Close to 200 copies of the illustrated hardcover book have been sold, mostly to friends, relatives and others through Amazon, Barnes and Noble, the sisters’ website, and Micawber’s, a book store in St. Anthony Park.
The sisters publicly launched their book Feb. 2 with “Stories: The Door to Compassion,” a joint presentation at the St. Anthony Park library, along with William Kent Krueger, a New York Times best selling fiction author and St. Paul resident. Krueger’s 2017 book, Sulfur Springs, touches on the tensions at the border.
The next joint presentation is scheduled for Feb. 16 at the Anoka Rum River public library.
The sisters hope the book raises more awareness about the border situation. Now, what would Florence Victor think about her oral tale becoming a book and a channel for such an effort?
“It’s hard to say what she would think,” Victor-Larsen said. “She was a small, salt-of-the-earth, self-reliant, hardworking woman who had plenty of challenges in her life. She believed in self reliance, but I think it would have made her angry to see people at a disadvantage taken advantage of and trampled on.”

Ford to invest, add jobs to Chicago operations

Texto completo: Ford Motor Co. said Thursday that it would invest $1 billion in its Chicago-area manufacturing operations to expand production of its Ford Explorer and Lincoln Aviator sport utility vehicles.
The announcement, made at the Chicago Auto Show, will add 500 jobs to two manufacturing facilities, the assembly plant and stamping plant, said Joe Hinrichs, Ford's president of global operations. The expansion is part of a commitment the company made in its agreement with the United Auto Workers in 2015, and brings the total number of workers at its Chicago-area plants to 5,800.
The overhaul of the plants -- an assembly plant at 12600 S. Torrence Ave. in Chicago and a stamping plant in Chicago Heights -- is expected to begin in March and be completed in the spring.
"When it's all finished, Chicago Assembly will have an all-new, state-of-the-art body shop, an all-new paint shop and new tooling to build this new lineup. And the Chicago Stamping Plant will have all new lines to support the new vehicles," Hinrichs said.
The announcement comes as Ford continues a major restructuring put in place by CEO Jim Hackett, who was named to the position following the abrupt dismissal of Mark Fields in 2017.
In recent months, Ford has announced steep job cuts to its salaried workforce and an overhaul of its European operations as it embarks on a significant shift in its product lineup that includes the discontinuation of slower-selling sedans like the Fusion in favor of trucks and SUVs.
The changes come amid a recent decline in earnings, though workers at the two Chicago-area plants recently learned they would receive profit-sharing checks of $7,500 for 2018.
But as Ford continues its restructuring, its Chicago-area operations stand to benefit from the emphasis on larger vehicles.
"There's good news today" for the plant's workers, said Jessica Caldwell, executive director of industry analysis at Edmunds, an auto-research website. Any plant that is involved in manufacturing larger vehicles like SUVs, she said, is in a stronger position as Ford restructures. But she added, "This is one small piece of a very large puzzle."
The production of the Explorer ST, the Police Interceptor and the Aviator will add to Ford's position as the top producer of vehicles in the U.S., with nearly 2.4 million built in 2018, the company said. "This investment will further strengthen Ford's SUV market leadership," Hinrichs said.
Ford also announced that it would spend $40 million to improve working conditions at the plants, including new team break areas on the plant floor, increased security, better lighting and a renovated cafeteria.
Working conditions have long been a source of scrutiny and legal trouble for the company. In 2017, The New York Times highlighted a history of sexual and racial harassment at the two plants. The article prompted an apology from Hackett and a promise of stricter oversight and training. And earlier that summer, workers reported an embarrassing string of auto thefts from the parking lots at the plants. A Ford spokeswoman said that the improvements were not a response to the reports.
The Chicago Assembly Plant -- which began making the Model T in 1924 -- represents one of the few large assembly operations remaining for Ford in a large American city. Many have closed as Ford has spread its manufacturing operations around the world.
But President Donald Trump has applied enormous pressure on domestic automakers to keep their plants, and the jobs that go with them, in the U.S. In 2017, in an abrupt reversal, Ford said it would cancel plans for a $1.6 billion plant to make small cars in Mexico, instead adding 700 jos to s plant in Michigan.
"It's a real vote of confidence in this city," Mayor Rahm Emanuel said, noting that in 2011, Ford added 1,200 jobs to the two plants. Emanuel also said that the city had ordered 200 new police cruisers from Ford.

A mail-order DNA test unravels a lifetime mystery for ‘Inheritance’ author Dani Shapiro

Texto completo: Of all the millions of people who have spit into a plastic vial and sent their DNA off to have it analyzed, writer Dani Shapiro might be the most prepared for what happened next.
The core of Shapiro’s work — this bestselling author has written 10 books — has always concerned family issues, those tangled emotional webs we weave around each other and the secrets we keep.
“It has been a huge part of what formed me as a writer — I had an obsession with searching and digging, trying to understand,” Shapiro says, noting that half of her books are memoirs about deep, personal exploration. “I idly wondered why (I kept writing memoirs) but those were the books that continued to present themselves to me as necessary. And that comes very much out of not knowing something and writing in order to try to know.”
Part of what she didn’t know was why, with her fair hair and blue eyes, she barely resembled her parents, both Orthodox Jews from Eastern Europe — an otherness remarked upon by people throughout her life.
All is revealed when the results of an Ancestry.com test that she took “on a whim” come back: She is not her beloved father’s biological daughter after all, but the product of artificial insemination her parents turned to when they could not conceive. Why that happened and what meaning Shapiro makes of it is the subject of her riveting new memoir, “Inheritance: A Memoir of Genealogy, Paternity, and Love.”
“This discovery poured gasoline over everything I thought I knew and threw a match on it,” she says. “Now I see the whole picture.”
Since its release in January, the book has quickly risen to the New York Times bestseller list for nonfiction and has already been optioned by Hollywood, a clear indication that both her writing and the topic of family secrets is speaking to the hearts of millions.
“I certainly wanted it to resonate with people who had been through similar experiences or discovered there were family secrets —everybody seems to have them,” said Shapiro in a phone interview while she was on the road for her national book tour that lands in Southern California for several appearances this week.
“Adoptees, people who discover they were donor conceived, or have half siblings — there are so many of those kinds of secrets tumbling out of the closet right now,” she observes.
More like an avalanche.
She notes that in 2018 alone 7 million Ancestry.com kits were purchased — and that doesn’t take into account what might be sold for other commercial DNA services like 23andMe. (DNA kits were the No. 1 holiday gift last year, too.) Shapiro discovered while researching “Inheritance” that out of the 7 million kits, 14 percent revealed what’s known in that industry as ”NPE,” Not Parent Expected: “That’s a huge number of people. Many of them, like me, were just recreational DNA testing.”
The ease and accessibility of these DNA tests herald a historical shift, she believes. “I think this is a moment in our culture when secrets and the impossibility of secrets is reaching a deafening roar,” Shapiro observes. “Paternity, ethnicity — these were secrets people could keep since the beginning of time, and did. And now that is over. I think in a few decades the idea that there ever were these secrets is going to seem like the most ridiculous thing you’d ever heard.”
Yet the exploration she undertakes in this book is even more universal: At the center is the question: How do heredity and history combine to make us who we are?
Says Shapiro: “I was also very aware that I did not only want people that could directly relate to the material to be readers of this book, because I felt I had learned so much in this really sort of harsh and complicated, and ultimately liberating, journey. I learned so much about identity, and family, and what makes a father a father, and about nature and nurture.”
Anyone who knows Shapiro’s work understands that she was close to her father, who died in an accident when she was 23, and distant from her abusive mother. These are themes that have run throughout her work. Reconciling her experience with her biological makeup was the “emotionally challenging” part of her journey to write this book.
“One of the things I had to contend with was the deep suspicion that I was part of my father’s sadness. The man that I tried so hard to make happy. But I don’t think that diminished in any way the love he had for me,” she says. “The irony is my biological parent is the one I felt a deep disconnection from, while my father, who was not my biological parent, was the one to whom I was connected. I think that my mother looked at me for all of our shared life together and found it very challenging because I was her secret. I was a reminder of their infertility; I was not my father’s child and on some very deep animal level, she knew it.”
There’s a moment in “Inheritance” where a friend tells her, “Everyone feels other,” and that she had been the explorer to come back to teach us all something about what that means. “I very much took that to heart,” she says.

Obsessed With the Tactile Tools of the Trade

Texto completo: How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Daisuke Wakabayashi, a technology reporter in San Francisco, discussed the tech he's using.
What are your most important tech tools?
I'm most particular about the tech products I use as basic tools of my job. I'm a maniac about keyboards and mice; I generally hate most of them. While I use Macs at home and at work, I dislike every Apple keyboard and don't care for the company's mice, either. The keys are too flat, I never know if I've pressed hard enough, and it hurts my hands after a while.
As my colleagues will tell you, I use a very loud mechanical keyboard made by Das Keyboards. These mechanical keyboards are similar to the ones that came with my family's first IBM computer from the 1980s. I've also used the same mouse for the last five years.
Aside from that, I use an app called Voice Record Pro on my iPhone for recording interviews. If I'm recording a phone call -- with permission, of course -- I'll use an app from Rev, which is also the service I use to have my interviews transcribed. It's a little steep at $1 per minute, but the accuracy is so much better than the A.I.-only alternatives that cost like 10 cents a minute.
Why are you so particular about your mouse and keyboard?
I feel like I type faster and more accurately with this keyboard -- which is important because I'm already a slow typer. What's more, the tactile responsiveness when I push a key is so satisfying. It's silly but it also makes me feel productive, each keystroke an audio reminder that I'm one step closer to my goal.
There are drawbacks. The keyboard is not as sleek and visually appealing as the Apple keyboards. They are also super loud, and the click-clacks can be distracting for people around you, as well as unsettling for people you're on the phone with if you're taking notes. I've often been stopped by sources who ask why I'm typing so feverishly, afraid that I'm pounding the keys because they said something they shouldn't have. Now, I'll sometimes take notes by hand using a pen and paper, and then transcribe them later if it's a sensitive conversation.
My mouse for the last five years has been a wireless one from Microsoft. It's called the Sculpt Ergonomic Mouse. I like this mouse because it has good heft. Some wireless mice are too light, and they dart around like a hyperactive child. I also don't want too big of a mouse, and then I feel like arm-wrestling with the device. This one provides a good balance. Also the bottom is plastic, and it's quiet when I move the mouse around on my desk. The Apple ones make this cringey scraping sound.
(Again, I acknowledge that I'm crazy when it comes to my computer accessories.)
You cover Google, and in a past life you covered Apple. Both are fierce competitors with their own mobile operating systems, internet services, smartphones and computers. What do you see as the challenges for the companies going forward?
Apple has focused on creating beautiful, easy-to-use products, but I find that its products are becoming harder to use.
I think some of it is just a function of our devices being asked to do more -- my iPhone is central to my life in ways that it wasn't even three years ago -- and how do you build in that additional capability without bogging down the software? Apple's products are still beautiful, but I think that form is overtaking function in some areas. (See: headphone jack, lack of ports on laptops.) A device's beauty is meaningful only if it is also useful.
Google's issues are different. They're not purely product questions, but are more fundamental.
The company turned 20 last year, and it feels like it's going through an identity crisis. Google was the anti-Microsoft in the early days. Many of its longtime employees were drawn to Google not purely because it was a moneymaking machine but because it also seemed interested in being a force for good in the tech industry. Who can forget "Don't Be Evil" and all that?
But as Google has grown increasingly dominant, it has become difficult to subscribe to a self-image of a whimsical do-gooder when everyone else sees you as Godzilla trampling across the internet landscape. We've already seen some employee revolts, and I suspect we'll see more. Look at how it is wrestling with what it plans to do with search in China, which shows this identity crisis is filtering into its business and products decisions.
Outside of work, what tech product are you and your family currently obsessed with?
My wife and I have a 2-year-old son, and he just loves playing with our digital speakers. We have an Amazon Echo in the kitchen and a Google Home upstairs. They're both connected to Spotify. He knows that he can ask Alexa or Google to play "Wheels on the Bus" or "Baa-Baa Black Sheep" and, voilà, the music comes on.
But these days he's become more particular, and he likes a version of "Wheels on the Bus" performed by Mother Goose Club, so he'll shout something like, "Alexa, play 'Wheels on the Bus,' the goose one, PLEEEEEEEEASE." (We've tried to tell him that Alexa won't do as he asks unless he says please.) Alexa and Google usually struggle to decipher this request, so Mom and Dad frequently intervene, but occasionally Alexa or Google understands him and he is delighted.
His other favorite activity is to ask Google to play sounds of different things. His favorite requests (in no particular order): animals, emergency vehicles and modes of transportation. Recently, he discovered that Google can play the sound of a dinosaur, and this excited him to no end.
But now my son thinks anything with an illuminated green ring means it's a portal for Alexa. Recently, I found him shouting instructions to my wireless iPhone charging pad. It got me thinking, why doesn't Amazon make an Echo that doubles as a wireless phone charging pad? My toddler the innovator.

Texto completo: WEST LAFAYETTE – Howard Schultz, the former CEO of Starbucks, will be at Purdue University Thursday to make what The Washington Post reported would be "a major policy address" leading up to the possibility that he might make an independent run for president.
Purdue President Mitch Daniels on Tuesday morning confirmed that Schultz would be on campus Thursday. Daniels told the J&C that Schultz reached out to Purdue about the event.
The talk will be at 1 p.m. Thursday in Fowler Hall, a 388-seat venue in Purdue's Stewart Center. Seating will be limited "to invited and ticketed members of the university's governance councils," according to Tim Doty, a Purdue spokesman.
A livestream of the talk will be shown in Loeb Playhouse, which is down the hall in Purdue's Stewart Center and has 1,038 seats.
The format for the event — lecture, Q&A with Daniels or straight-up rally — wasn't immediately specified by Purdue or Schultz's team.
Schultz has been a center of attention after saying he was considering an independent bid in 2020. Some Democrats have blasted his strategy of going for moderate voters, saying that a third-party candidacy would siphon votes from a Democratic nominee and help President Donald Trump win re-election.
In the past week, Schultz has criticized both Trump and candidates lining up on the left, insisting that he could win the White House by going for American voters disaffected by the partisan fighting from both sides.
"I am certainly prepared for the cynics and the naysayers to come out and say this cannot be done," Schultz told The New York Times. "I don't agree with them. I think it's un-American to say it can't be done. I'm not doing this to be a spoiler."
Trump went after Schultz after "60 Minutes" aired a profile of billionaire on Jan. 27.
"Howard Schultz doesn't have the 'guts' to run for President!" Trump tweeted. "Watched him on @60Minutes last night and I agree with him that he is not the 'smartest person.' Besides, America already has that! I only hope that Starbucks is still paying me their rent in Trump Tower!"
Over the weekend, on CNN, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat said to be considering a run in 2020, called an independent run by Schultz "an enormous mistake."
"He has had a successful legacy as a businessperson," Inslee said on CNN, "and it would be tarnished beyond imagination if he does the only thing that his candidacy would do would be to help the re-election of Donald Trump."
Bill Burton, a spokesman for Schultz, told The Washington Post leading up to the Purdue visit: "Howard burst onto the scene in a way that no one anticipated, and now that a majority of Americans know who is he is, he is laying out some of his ideas and prescriptions for the greatest problems facing our country."
Aaron Banks, Purdue's student body president, said Schultz's team reached out this week to Purdue Student Government, which will sponsor the visit Thursday.
"I believe it is important for us as an organization to provide opportunities for students to hear dialogue from and interact directly with people like Howard Schultz, so we jumped on the opportunity," Banks said. "As someone who is passionate about entrepreneurship and business, Howard Schultz is someone who I've admired in regards to those two categories. I'm interested to hear his thoughts on politics and his potential role in them in the future."
There's another connection to Purdue, or at least to Daniels.
When asked at week ago by a reporter from Axios to name a Republican he admired, Schultz mentioned Daniels, who was a two-time Republican governor in Indiana before he came to Purdue in January 2013.
In September 2016, Daniels hosted a Q&A at Purdue with Gary Johnson, former New Mexico governor who was making a presidential run as a Libertarian. During the 2016 campaign, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders also held a campaign event at Purdue ahead of Indiana's May primary.

Online’s ‘walled gardens’ must stop assuming real news is free

Texto completo: Facebook and Google have been brutal to the news business. But this primarily reflects a failure of imagination. The tech giants are the world’s best distribution platforms and could be an answer for journalism instead of a grave threat.
As readers have shifted to digital sources, the two companies have taken a large majority of online advertising revenue. More important, the platforms now act as "regulators" of the news business — determining what information gets delivered to whom, and when. With the flick of an algorithmic finger, those two companies decide what news you see and whether a publisher lives or dies.
The impact on journalism has been clear. Just within the past week, we have seen over 1,000 planned layoffs at Gannett, BuzzFeed and HuffPost, and no one thinks we are anywhere near the end. Facebook and Google’s answer so far has been to pledge to spend $300 million each over the next three years to help journalism. But that money will be dribbled across a huge news landscape, and much of it will undoubtedly be used to encourage further use of Facebook and Google products.
But such investments amount to charity, and charity will never be the answer. What news publishers really need are active partners who are willing to embrace the idea that quality journalism sustains our civic society and that the answer to bad information is more good information.
We can start with the fact that "free" isn’t a good business model for quality journalism. Facebook and Google flatly refuse to pay for news even though they license many other types of content. Both companies have deals to pay music publishers when copyrighted songs play on their platforms. And the companies also aggressively bid to stream live sports and entertainment content to run on Facebook Watch and YouTube. These deals are varied and often secret, but none of them are based on "free." Why are the platforms so unwilling to pay news publishers for access to the quality journalism that users need and value?
The tech giants are also run as "walled gardens" that minimize brands and separate publishers from their readers — even while hoarding information about those same readers. Imagine trying to build a trusted relationship with an audience when you can’t even know who they are. Publishers need new economic terms that include more revenue and more information about our readers. Any minor costs to these companies would pay huge dividends not only for our society but also for their credibility with Congress and policymakers around the world.
Facebook and Google also need to be willing to acknowledge investments in quality journalism through their algorithms. They are constantly on the defensive about spreading false and misleading "news" that hurts people. They could start to address the problem by simply recognizing that The Miami Herald is a much better news source than Russian bots or Macedonian teenagers — and highlighting original, quality content accordingly.
A study by the University of North Carolina’s School of Media and Journalism found that more than 1,300 American communities have completely lost sources of local news.
David Simon, a former newspaper journalist who became a TV writer, lamented the loss of local coverage and said in an interview with The Guardian: "Oh, to be a state or local official in America over the next 10 to 15 years, before somebody figures out the business model. To gambol freely across the wastelands of an American city, as a local politician! It’s got to be one of the great dreams in the history of American corruption."
Facebook and Google could address these risks by embracing responsibilities and becoming partners, rather than minor benefactors, for journalism. They need to come to the table with a real deal on revenue, data and algorithms.
Facebook and Google talk incessantly about how they are improving the world. Why not do something genuinely good for all of us and support journalism instead of destroying it? And it wouldn’t even have to be that hard. There is plenty of money and quality content to go around. All it would take is a little enlightened self-interest and a real commitment to the continued existence of quality news.

Joshua tree in one photo was cut before shutdown, park official says

Texto completo: Some of the most iconic photographs taken inside national parks during the partial government shutdown were of fallen Joshua trees inside Joshua Tree National Park.
One of those images, which showed a downed Joshua tree that had apparently been felled, was published in early January by the nonprofit publication National Parks Traveler.
The image was later seen by thousands online and used in stories from The Daily Mail, CNN and other news sites.
But that tree, which park officials believed was downed as a result of vandalism during the shutdown, was actually cut down before the shutdown, the park's superintendent told National Parks Traveler in a recent article.
"When park botanists were able to get to the site at a later date, they confirmed that this tree was in fact cut down prior to the shutdown," Superintendent David Smith told the publication.
"The park apologizes for any confusion this initial report may have caused," Smith added.
Smith did not respond to several requests for comment from The Desert Sun on Saturday.
New details about the tree photograph came after the park garnered national media attention as one of the places visually impacted during the government shutdown. At a rally in Joshua Tree after the shutdown ended, former Joshua Tree National Park Superintendent Curt Sauer said "what's happened to our park in the last 34 days is irreparable for the next 200 to 300 years."
The photo from National Parks Traveler, which updated its first story with an editor's note on Saturday, was not the only fallen Joshua tree image shared online during the shutdown.
Photos of another Joshua tree taken originally by the Los Angeles Times were circulated in various media reports, from the Huffington Post to The New York Times.
Reports of damage inside the park emerged weeks into the shutdown.
Last month, Smith said park staff "documented three cases of Joshua trees being cut down or damaged during the shutdown." A January news release from the park also acknowledged incidents of "new roads being created by motorists."
In his comments to National Parks Traveler, Smith confirmed at least one Joshua tree was damaged.
"Joshua Tree science staff are currently working to assemble an accurate and detailed report documenting natural and cultural resource damage that occurred during the shutdown," he told the publication. "Botanists have confirmed that during the shutdown an out of bounds vehicle at Ryan Campground struck and killed at least one Joshua Tree."
During the shutdown, the surrounding community rallied to keep the park maintained by cleaning bathrooms, picking up trash in campgrounds, restocking toilet paper and taking trailers full of waste to the dump.
"I feel that the local volunteers as well as our maintenance crews have done a great job taking care of the park, dealing with issues of damage and providing visitor services," Smith told The Desert Sun last month.
Cliffhanger Guides owners Seth Zaharias and Sabra Purdy were among the leaders spearheading volunteer efforts.
With so many people wanting to help, they started having a standing morning meeting at local gift shop Coyote Corner, just across the street from the park's west entrance visitors center.
"There is no way the park could have withstood the onslaught of humanity that is the Christmas/New Year's holiday without the efforts of volunteers," Purdy said in a Facebook message.
"I can't stress enough how bad it could have gotten," she added. "The reports of overflowing toilets and trash strewn across the desert in the media were quite overblown, but it definitely would have gotten there very quickly if people hadn't sprung into action."

Here are the guests Southern California lawmakers are bringing to State of the Union address

Texto completo: Think of it as the Oscars red carpet, State of the Union style.
But instead of outfits and hairdos, the focus is on who members of Congress are bringing as guests to the annual speech from the president about how America is doing. Often, the choice of guest is – much like the speech itself – a political statement, one meant to show approval or scorn of a president’s policies.
This year’s State of the Union guests from the Democrat-heavy California delegation include a woman who lost her home to a wildfire and her income to last month’s federal government shutdown, President Donald Trump’s former housekeeper, and undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children.
Here are some of the guests who will be in the gallery when Trump speaks Tuesday, Feb. 5.
Victims of fire, shutdown, or both
Trisha Pesiri-Dybvik, guest of Democratic presidential candidate and Sen. Kamala Harris, D-California, is a wife of a Navy veteran and a mother of three. In 2017, her family was displaced by the Thomas Fire, which destroyed their Ventura home.
They moved to a rental property in Camarillo, which they had to evacuate in 2018 when rains threatened to cause flooding and mudslides in burn areas from that year’s Woolsey and Hill fires.
So far this year, Pesiri-Dybvik, an air traffic control specialist, has been forced to work without a paycheck when the government shut down for 35 days over a dispute between Trump and congressional Democrats over the president’s demand for a border wall.
She won’t be the only air traffic controller affected by the shutdown to attend Trump’s speech. Shyan-Lasater-Bailey of Moreno Valley, who works at Palm Springs International Airport, will be the guest of Rep. Mark Takano, D-Riverside.
Coast Guard members also worked without pay during the shutdown. To bring attention to their struggles, Rep. Nanette Diaz Barragan, D-San Pedro, is inviting retired Coast Guard Capt. Charlene Downey.
Trump’s former housekeeper
A Costa Rica native and the guest of Rep. Jimmy Gomez, D-Los Angeles, Sandra Diaz worked as a housekeeper at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., from 2010 to 2013.
Now a U.S. citizen, the New York Times reported that Diaz was an undocumented immigrant at the time that she worked for Trump, and her supervisors were aware of her status. “She said she washed and ironed Mr. Trump’s white boxers, golf shirts and khaki trousers, as well as his sheets and towels,” the Times article read.
“It’s no small feat for a migrant from Costa Rica to stand up to a bully and hypocrite in the White House,” Gomez said in a news release.
“She is living proof that President Trump couldn’t be more wrong – both morally and factually – when he demonizes those who come to America seeking a better life.”
Opioid crisis
The guest of Rep. Judy Chu, D-Pasadena, Ryan Hampton became addicted to opioids 15 years ago during treatment for an injury, said Ben Surato, a Chu spokesman.
Since then, Hampton has stopped using heroin and written a book about the opioid crisis, “American Fix: Inside the Opioid Addiction Crisis and How to End It.”
“He was able to get treatment, only to see his friend die in a sober-living facility due to lack of training and resources,” Surato. “After that, he reached out to Rep. Chu … That meeting resulted in … the Ensuring Access to Quality Sober Living Act which was ultimately included in the opioids package signed into law last year.”
Tuesday, an op-ed by Hampton, who once worked in the Clinton White House, will run in USA Today “about how pharmaceutical companies and domestic policies are driving the opioid crisis, not the (border) wall,” Surato added.
Feb. 2, 2019 marked Hampton’s fourth sober anniversary.
DREAMers
For several lawmakers, their State of the Union guest will be a DREAMer, an undocumented immigrant who was brought to the United States as a child. The residency status of most DREAMers has been in limbo since the president announced plans to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, a program that shields DREAMers from deportation.
Rep. Lou Correa, D-Santa Ana, is bringing a former DREAMer, Marco Villada, who last year became trapped in Mexico (he previously had received State Department permission to leave the U.S.) while attempting to change his residency status after marrying his husband. He has since returned to the United States.
Other DREAMers accompanying members of Congress to the State of the Union include Lucero Sanchez, who attends UC San Diego and is the guest of Rep. Mike Levin, D-San Juan Capistrano, and Miriam Tellez, a Cal State Fullerton student and the guest of Rep. Gil Cisneros, D-Yorba Linda.

Texto completo: In most histories of how Americans became so polarized, the Great Inflation of the 1970s is given short shrift -- sometimes no shrift at all. This is wrong. Inflation was as pivotal a factor in our national crackup as Vietnam and Watergate.
Inflation changed how Americans thought about their economic relationships to their fellow citizens -- which is to say, inflation and its associated economic traumas changed who we were as a people. It also called into question the economic assumptions that had guided the country since World War II, opening the door for new assumptions that have governed us ever since. Here is the story:
The United States of the 1960s experienced many social upheavals. But in one realm, all was copacetic. The economy roared. The gross domestic product was increasing between 2 percent and 6 percent, wages grew, jobs were stable. The year 1968 was an annus horribilis -- assassinations, riots, a bitter presidential race. But the Economic Report of the President for that year reflected at length on -- imagine this -- "the problem of prosperity."
Slowly, though, inflation entered the picture. It hit 5.7 percent in 1970, then 11 percent in 1974. Such sustained inflation was something that had never happened in stable postwar America. And it was punishing. For a family of modest means, a trip to the supermarket was now a walk over hot coals.
How different this was from previous economic crises! The Great Depression, the 20th century's first economic emergency, made most Americans feel a degree of neighborly solidarity. The government wasn't measuring median household income in the 1930s, but a 2006 Department of Labor study pegged the average household income of 1934-36 at $1,524. Adjust for inflation to 2018, that's about $28,000, while the official poverty level for a family of four was $25,100. In other words, the average family of 1936 was near poor. Everyone was in it together, and if Bill couldn't find work, his neighbor would give him a head of cabbage, a slab of pork belly.
But the Great Inflation, as the author Joe Nocera has noted, made most people feel they had to look out for themselves. Americans had spent decades just getting more and more ahead. Now, suddenly, they were falling behind.
Throw in wage stagnation, which began in the early '70s, and deindustrialization of the great cities of the North. Pennsylvania's Homestead Works, which had employed 20,000 men during the war, started shrinking, closing forever in 1986. Today that tract of land along the Monongahela River where the works once stood is home to the usual chain restaurants and big-box stores, those ubiquitous playpens of the low-wage economy.
Inflation also produced the manic search for "yield" -- it was no longer enough to save money; your money had to make money, turning every wage earner into a player in market rapaciousness. The money market account was born in the 1970s. Personal investing took off (remember "When E.F. Hutton talks, people listen"?).
Even as Americans scrambled for return, they also sought to spend. Credit cards, which had barely existed in 1970, began to proliferate. The Supreme Court's 1978 decision in Marquette National Bank of Minneapolis v. First of Omaha Service Corporation opened the floodgates for banks to issue credit cards with high interest rates. Total credit card balances began to explode.
Then along came Ronald Reagan. The great secret to his success was not his uncomplicated optimism or his instinct for seizing a moment. It was that he freed people of the responsibility of introspection, released them from the guilt in which liberalism seemed to want to make them wallow. And so came the 1980s, when the culture started to celebrate wealth and acquisition as never before. A television series called "Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous" debuted in 1984.
So that was the first change flowing from the Great Inflation: Americans became a more acquisitive -- bluntly, a more selfish -- people. The second change was far more profound.
For decades after World War II, the economic assumptions that undergirded policymaking were basically those of John Maynard Keynes. His "demand side" theories -- increase demand via public investment, even if it meant running a short-term deficit -- guided the New Deal, the financing of the war and pretty much all policy thinking thereafter. And not just among Democrats: Dwight Eisenhower and Richard Nixon were Keynesians.
There had been a group of economists, mostly at the University of Chicago and led by Milton Friedman, who dissented from Keynes. They argued against government intervention and for lower taxes and less regulation. As Keynesian principles promoted demand side, their theories promoted the opposite: supply side.
They'd never won much of an audience, as long as things were working. But now things weren't, in a big way. Inflation was Keynesianism's Achilles' heel, and the supply-siders aimed their arrow right at it. Reagan cut taxes significantly. Inflation ended (which was really the work of Paul Volcker, the chairman of the Federal Reserve). The economy boomed. Economic debate changed; even the way economics was taught changed.
And this, more or less, is where we've been ever since. Yes, we've had two Democratic presidents in that time, both of whom defied supply-side principles at key junctures. But walk down a street and ask 20 people a few questions about economic policy -- I bet most will say that taxes must be kept low, even on rich people, and that we should let the market, not the government, decide on investments. Point to the hospital up the street and tell them that it wouldn't even be there without the millions in federal dollars of various kinds it takes in every year, and they'll mumble and shrug.
There are signs this mind-set is changing. The Trump tax cut of 2017 is consistently unpopular. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York, speaks of a top marginal tax rate of 70 percent on income over $10 million, and instead of getting laughed out of town, she prompts a serious public debate.
Still, we have a long way to go. Dislodging 40-year-old assumptions is a huge job. The Democrats, for starters, have to develop and defend a plausible alternative theory of growth.
But others have a responsibility here too -- notably, our captains of commerce. They have enormous power, and in a country this polarized, they can move moderate and maybe even conservative public opinion in a way that Democratic politicians, civic leaders and celebrities cannot.
They will always be rich. But they have to decide what kind of country they want to be rich in. A place of more and more tax cuts for them, where states keep slashing their higher-education spending and tuitions keep skyrocketing; where the best job opportunity in vast stretches of America is selling opioids; where many young people no longer believe in capitalism and record numbers of them would leave this country if they could? Or a country more like the one they and their parents grew up in, where we invested in ourselves and where work produced a fair and livable wage?
The Great Inflation was an inflection point that changed us for the worse. This moment can be another such point, but one that will change us for the better.

Texto completo: Roger J. Stone Jr. set foot on the stage -- sorry, the floor of the federal court in Washington -- on Friday for his scheduling hearing in a somber pinstriped ocean-dark suit, matching dark tie, pristine white shirt and muted pocket handkerchief, bringing to a temporary close the latest installment of what may become one of the most-watched spinoffs of the reality show known as "The Trump Administration."
It was a veritable replay of what Mr. Stone, the political operative and former Trump adviser, chose to wear for his earlier court appearance, on Tuesday (a single-breasted three-button navy suit, pure white shirt with a Windsor collar, white pocket handkerchief and marine blue knit tie).
That itself was a more formal version of the navy polo shirt with white polo pony and dark jeans Mr. Stone had worn last Friday, when he was arrested on seven counts of obstruction, witness tampering and making false statements. He appeared after the indictment with both arms raised in a Nixonian victory sign.
Why do such costumes matter?
Because Mr. Stone has long treated -- and referred to -- his wardrobe as exactly that: a key part of the theater of his life in politics.
This is, after all, a man who wore full morning dress to the 2017 inauguration; who is famous for his penchant for bespoke double-breasted suits from Savile Row or Alan Flusser (a tailor known for his master-of-the-universe clients); who once joked that he had more shoes than Imelda Marcos; and who called himself a "showman" in his 2018 book, "Stone's Rules: How to Win at Politics, Business, and Style." Someone who believes fully in the power of clothing as communications tool, and is comfortable admitting it. Crowing about it, even.
And because in court, defendants generally don't talk. Their lawyers, their demeanor and their clothes talk for them. Given that Judge Amy Berman Jackson is still considering a gag order preventing Mr. Stone (who spent his time between hearings giving news conferences and making appearances) from discussing his case publicly, it's possible that at some point he won't be able to speak out of court either. Which puts an even greater burden on what he wears to start emoting in his place.
So what does it mean that Mr. Stone, who runs a best- and worst-dressed list of his own, has suddenly adopted a sartorial stance of relative (on the Stone spectrum) understatement?
First, that nothing he is wearing was chosen by accident, not even the polo and jeans. After all, he well understands that, as he wrote in "Stone's Rules": "An impression is made based on how you are dressed. It's how you present yourself, how the world sees you." (Of the 140 rules in the book, 54 are overtly about clothes.)
Just as he presumably understands that if ever a president cared about how costumes play, it is Mr. Trump (generals! straight from central casting!). Who in a recent interview with The New York Times happened to refer to Mr. Stone as a "character."
And that Mr. Stone well understands that the president -- someone who does not like his deputies to steal his spotlight, holds the power of the small screen dear and has the power of the pardon -- will be watching.
In which case, No. 30 of "Stone's Rules" comes into play: "A well-cut dark blue suit is required for any public performance where credibility and authority are key." Probably the current situation qualifies.
Indeed, not long after his Tuesday court visit, Mr. Stone appeared in a somewhat surprising video posted on the YouTube channel of the Daily Caller, the conservative website co-founded by Tucker Carlson where he also has a fashion column (Stone on Style), in which he announced, "You have to think long and hard about what you're going to wear before your arraignment." He talked everyone through the choices he made, including cuff links, pocket square and underwear (the latter perhaps falling into the category of too much information).
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
He went so far as to reveal in that video that he chose not to wear one of his many made-to-measure double-breasted suits (he is partial to pinstripes and plaid) because they were "a little too wealthy looking and I am dirt poor at this point, having been destroyed financially by a two-year inquisition by Robert Mueller."
Then he told everyone that the three-button suit he did go for was 30 years old. And while he acknowledged the potential foppish touch of the pocket hankie, he called the one he picked "pedestrian," perhaps to lessen the effect.
The theory has some merit. If one is trying to communicate truthfulness and transparency, as Mr. Stone's previous statements would suggest is his aim, then he is correct in saying that dressing in the clothes of the skyscraper set -- the kind that suggest bourbon in cut crystal glasses on the way to a private plane with butter-soft leather seats -- is probably not the way to start.
On the other hand, the navy-and-white combo he has adopted as a quasi uniform, which in color theory has associations with true blue loyalty and innocence, tells a different story. And, in wearing what he has written about, arguably, he is demonstrating the courage of his convictions.
Still, by Friday Mr. Stone seemed to have changed his mind about the single- versus double-breasted idea. Perhaps because he has also admitted that his double-breasted suits are his "armor," and right now he needs as much of that as he can get.

Texto completo: It has been one day since NFL commissioner Roger Goodell rose to the podium at this year's Atlanta Super Bowl to declare, once again, that the State of our NFL has never been better. And then, as he had for 12 years since he was granted the title, Goodell spent the rest of the press conference dodging blows.
Over the years he's been glanced but never KO'd by questions about concussions, catches, rules, cheerleaders, domestic violence, gambling, ownership and Colin Kaepernick.
At a reported $40 million a year, Goodell is the most expensive decoy NFL owners can buy. Forget about protecting the shield, he's the NFL's human shield.
This press conference has become a joke, and it undercuts the very picture of authority the NFL wants to paint. Goodell's stilted purgatory at the podium makes it seem as if he is bad at his job, and that's not a good message to send.
Think about it. The NFL holds a press conference every year at the Super Bowl, and every year it is a bust. It's full of spin, evasiveness and platitudes, and serves as a seminar on use of the passive voice. "There has been a great deal of communication," Goodell said about the notorious no-call in the Saints game, though he didn't go as far as to say mistakes were made.
"He leaves everyone frustrated," said longtime football writer Melissa Jacobs, "and punts on serious issues."
And not-so-serious issues. Goodell managed to answer a question about the cancelation of the Maroon 5 press conference without mentioning Maroon 5 or its canceled press conference. I could include the actual quote, but I want to keep readers awake through their morning commute.
In fact, the commissioner's answers were more illustrative of the things Goodell doesn't have control of - overruling calls, using replay more extensively, or getting Atlanta's diverse pool of musical artists to consider performing at the premiere event for a league that has mysteriously not hired a certain talented quarterback since he kneeled to protest social injustice.
This can't be what Goodell is like in meetings. And actually, according to many who have worked with him, it's not. Even some in the front office who have a good deal of respect and personal loyalty to Goodell dread seeing him fall flat annually.
"I absolutely think he's very effective in other ways," said former Raiders CEO Amy Trask, who is now an analyst for CBS. "He is an employee of the 32 clubs, that's what I say when people criticize Roger for these issues. Maybe the league's assessment is that they aren't as bothered by this as other people are. If they are bothered by it, what could they do instead?"
Jacobs posited replacing Goodell's press conference with one featuring three NFL owners, including the host city team owner.
"The owners are around," Jacobs said. "(Falcons owner) Arthur Blank was walking around on media day, (Patriots owner) Robert Kraft is everywhere. They are around, you have access. Obviously they care about the image of the league and the press conference makes a mockery of all these issues."
Trask, who understands how a press conference might not bring out the best in a person from her own days with the Raiders, suggested making the heads of different committees or departments available alongside Goodell. If there is a question he lacks the specifics on, he can defer to the NFL's lawyer, to the rules committee or to the VP for social responsibility.
It's a good idea if the goal of a press conference is to deliver information. But is that it?
You have to think that Goodell's awkward presentation is preferable in the minds of the people who really control the league. Better Goodell take the question on Kaepernick than Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, who said he wouldn't play anyone who "disrespects the flag." Better to have Goodell field a query on the conduct policy than owner Jim Irsay, who was nabbed for a DUI in 2014. Better Goodell parse gender diversity in coaching than Washington owner Dan Snyder, whose team starred in a New York Times expose of cheerleader exploitation last May.
Even if Goodell says nothing of substance, it may be preferable to the NFL to have the man with the illusion of power absorb the heat rather than hold those with actual power accountable.
The Super Bowl is a week-long show - a celebration of football, the sport's own version of the White House Correspondents dinner, where a freelance writer from a small market can cozy up to players and coaches to secure sourcing for the upcoming season. It's a convention of media, where fans and everyone who has a stake in the game can shimmy over to radio row for their moment near the microphone.
The one spot on the schedule that never lives up to expectation is the commissioner's press conference. Which may just be part of the bigger script.

Texto completo: SÃO PAULO, Brazil -- A well-connected businessman in Brazil conceived the idea of a luxurious getaway in Rio de Janeiro bearing a world-famous name: Trump.
After work began on the Trump Hotel Rio de Janeiro, the businessman, Paulo Figueiredo Filho, boasted about his access to Donald J. Trump, who was then a candidate for president. Mr. Figueiredo, the grandson of the last military dictator in the authoritarian government that ran Brazil from 1964 to 1985, displayed a picture of himself with Mr. Trump at the Trump Tower in New York, both men flashing a thumbs-up sign.
"He's one of the most recognized businessmen in the world, and if anything, we're getting more exposure," Mr. Figueiredo told The New York Times in an interview in 2015, in which he expressed admiration for Mr. Trump's policy positions.
But at the end of 2016, the Trump Organization pulled out of the project, and the golden letters with the Trump name were removed from the seaside building.
And now, the Brazilian investors who backed the project are engulfed in a growing bribery scandal, and an international arrest warrant is expected to be issued for Mr. Figueiredo.
The federal police in Brazil this week arrested 13 entrepreneurs and bank executives charged with diverting public pension funds into two commercial projects, including the former Trump hotel, in exchange for bribes and illegal commissions. The other project was a sprawling office building in Brasília.
Investigators did not implicate the Trump Organization in the scheme.
Authorities in Brazil said they are going to ask Interpol to issue an alert seeking the arrest of Mr. Figueiredo, who is now living in the United States.
Trump Hotels withdrew from the project in December 2016, just weeks after federal prosecutors launched a criminal investigation into the funding scheme. Prosecutors in the capital, Brasília, began the probe in October 2016, after identifying large investments in the hotel made by two small public pension funds.
At the time, the Trump Organization said it had pulled out because of delays in completing the 13-story, 171-room luxury property. The hotel opened in August 2016, in time for the Olympic Games, but before several floors and facilities had been finished, including a 4,000-square-foot nightclub.
The hotel was using the Trump name, and the Trump Organization had been managing the property. But the Trump Organization did not have an equity stake in the project, which was owned by LSH Barra, a Brazilian company based in Rio de Janeiro.
When the Trump Organization withdrew, the property's name was changed to LSH Lifestyle and all the floors and other work were eventually completed. Mr. Figueiredo was one of three partners in LSH Barra. The other two have been arrested.
Mr. Figueiredo, a young real estate mogul from Rio de Janeiro, was also on friendly terms with Flávio Bolsonaro, the eldest son of President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil. Flávio Bolsonaro, who has recently become the focus of a corruption investigation, shared a picture on social media calling Mr. Figueiredo a "successful businessman with good sense and a highly qualified political vision."
The developers behind LSH Barra are now being charged with corruption, money laundering and crimes against the financial system. Current and former directors of the state-owned Banco de Brasília and intermediaries who facilitated fake receipts are also facing charges.
Efforts to reach LSH Barra and Mr. Figueiredo for comment on Thursday were not successful.
Investigators overseeing the probe, which they called Operation Circus Maximus, said more than 40 million reais, or $11 million, in bribes were paid. The investments stood to affect hundreds of thousands of pension fund contributors.
"The contempt those involved had for the consequences of their actions is undeniable," Frederico Siqueira, a federal prosecutor, said in a statement, adding that the losses incurred as a result of the scheme totaled about $110 million.
Prosecutors said the bribes were frequently paid in cash but some were in kind, including VIP tickets to the Rock in Rio mega-concert and free catering for a wedding party.

Texto completo: How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Emily Bazelon, a staff writer for The New York Times Magazine, discussed the tech she's using.
What are the most important tools that you, as a magazine writer who does investigative reporting, rely on?
Honestly, the vital tool in my work is people's willingness to trust me with their stories and to patiently explain to me what I don't understand. That's what I need to do my job.
Everything is a means to that end. Talking to people face to face is still the best, and when I can't meet someone in person, Skype is my substitute. When I Skype from my laptop, it looks like I'm calling from my cellphone number. I use a software addition called Call Recorder to tape calls (after asking people's permission). It pops up when the call begins, which makes me remember to hit the button, and then it saves the calls in Ecamm Movie Tools. From there, it's easy to export the files and play them.
When I say easy, I mean it, because when a tech tool isn't easy to use to the point of being self-explanatory, I can't get myself to use it. I don't say that with pride. It's a handicap to be bad at solving tech-related problems. But when I can't figure something out quickly, I don't think, "Hmm, this is an interesting puzzle -- how can I solve it?" I just get frustrated and mad.
Another tool I rely on is my Zoom H1n digital voice recorder. It's light and hand-held, and it doesn't obviously look like a tape recorder. It even comes in a little case that looks as if it could be for eyeglasses. The sound quality is good, especially for its size.
I do think the design could be updated: For example, you need an old USB cable to export files onto your laptop, and then I have trouble remembering how to find them.
One more tool: Freedom of Information Act requests. The state and federal laws that allow citizens to request information from the government are a great friend. (There's a caveat: Some agencies take a long time to respond, so if you're on a tight deadline, you may be stonewalled.)
I've done investigative projects based on a relatively small number of documents, but if I ever have to sift through a huge data dump, looking for patterns and smoking guns, I'll use a software program called Everlaw. It lets you browse quickly without worrying about what format a document is in. (For example, you can switch back and forth between text messages and a PowerPoint.) I like the options it offers for organizing material. Full disclosure: My nephew Zach Sabin is a software engineer who helped develop this product.
You are also a co-host of Slate's Political Gabfest podcast . What does your podcast setup look like?
When David Plotz, John Dickerson and I started taping the Gabfest more than a dozen years ago, we worked together in an office in Washington and sat down in a studio there and just talked into microphones.
Then I moved to New Haven. For a while, I used a tie-line box, which is a kind of magical connection I won't try to explain. Later, I switched to an app for my iPhone called Report-IT Enterprise Edition. This one is dummy proof. It has a Report Live feature, which connects you in much the way the tie-line does, or so it seems to me.
Report-IT also offers Record a Report. For this option, you place a regular telephone call and then tape yourself talking into your iPhone. When the call is done, you upload it and send it off to some server in the sky.
I have screwed up Report-IT only once, and that was because I forgot to turn it on. Last year, though, it stopped working because of a security firewall in Slate's Washington office. So I started taping at the Yale Broadcast Studio, where the engineers are super nice and competent and all I have to do is stay on mic.
As a pretty active Twitter user , you get a fair amount of feedback from readers, good and bad. What's your advice for dealing with the hate?
My advice is to be thick skinned about hate but open to thoughtful criticism.
Of course, I don't always take my own advice.
Last summer, I wrote an essay for The Times Magazine about the term "white people," which launched a thousand neo-Nazi trolls in my Twitter timeline. Actually, I have no way of knowing if there were a thousand trolls or five trolls and 995 bots, but lots and lots of accounts were tweeting anti-Semitic garbage at me. Other Jewish journalists have experienced this to a greater degree than I did, and journalists of color regularly have it much worse, as do women who write about misogyny. I didn't enjoy my turn at being trolled, but I feel defiantly attached to my essay.
The danger of hateful feedback (in addition to the possibility of actual danger) is that to repel it, you risk numbing yourself to constructive criticism. I try to deal with this by giving myself a little time, after I publish a story, before I look at emails from readers or comments online. With distance, I can process criticism and funnel it into making my work better.
I have a book coming out in April, and I am really going to have to remember this when it comes out.
Outside of work, what tech product are you and your family using a lot?
Pity my children. Five years ago, when they were in elementary school and middle school, I published a book about bullying in which my basic advice to parents about technology was to delay access to it. Especially smartphones.
My sons got flip phones in seventh grade and iPhones in ninth grade (the older one) and eighth grade (the younger one). They would tell you that they missed out on certain social interactions, especially group texting, because their parents were dogmatic. (Also, in my own case, hypocritical -- I have trouble unplugging.)
I will say, though, that I still think setting limits is crucial. I like the mantra "People sleep upstairs. Phones sleep downstairs."
These days, my family bonds more over my tech ineptitude than any tech product. (It would be better if the gender dynamics in this story were reversed, but so it goes.) In particular, I'm mocked for not being able to turn on the television. There are four remote controls, with cryptic prompts for activating four different boxes. I can't keep it all straight. I get to pick the shows sometimes, though.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Everything is racist, 'Mary Poppins' edition

Texto completo: Wednesday morning, I criticized an absurd Arizona Republic op-ed titled, “Phoenix restaurant says this is a photo of coal miners. But I see offensive blackface.”

The target of my criticism, Rashaad Thomas, argued that a Phoenix-area restaurant displaying a nearly 100-year-old photo of soot-covered, beer-swilling Welsh coal miners is tantamount to the restaurant telling its minority patrons “whites only.”

“For me, the coal miners disappeared and a film honored for its artistic merit, despite being the most racist propaganda films ever, D.W. Griffith’s ‘Birth of a Nation’ (1915) surfaces, in which white actors appeared in blackface,” the author wrote. “At the downtown Phoenix restaurant, my concern that the photograph of men in blackface was a threat to me and my face and voice were ignored.”

In my article, I joked that we’re maybe one article away from someone writing about the tyranny of chimney sweeps. Roughly one hour after my brief critique of Thomas’ op-ed went live, a friend sent me a link to a New York Times article published on Jan. 28 titled, “‘Mary Poppins,’ and a Nanny’s Shameful Flirting With Blackface.”1.pngCome on, I had only been kidding!

The author of the Times op-ed, Daniel Pollack-Pelzner, writes that “one of the more indelible images from the 1964 film” is when Mary Poppins gamely applies soot to her face for a dance number involving her wards, the soot-covered Jane and Michael, and group of similarly soot-covered chimney sweeps.

Then we get to the meat of the article:

"This might seem like an innocuous comic scene if Travers’s novels didn’t associate chimney sweeps’ blackened faces with racial caricature. “Don’t touch me, you black heathen,” a housemaid screams in “Mary Poppins Opens the Door” (1943), as a sweep reaches out his darkened hand. When he tries to approach the cook, she threatens to quit: “If that Hottentot goes into the chimney, I shall go out the door,” she says, using an archaic slur for black South Africans that recurs on page and screen.
The 1964 film replays this racial panic in a farcical key. When the dark figures of the chimney sweeps step in time on a roof, a naval buffoon, Admiral Boom, shouts, “We’re being attacked by Hottentots!” and orders his cannon to be fired at the “cheeky devils.” We’re in on the joke, such as it is: These aren’t really black Africans; they’re grinning white dancers in blackface. It’s a parody of black menace; it’s even posted on a white nationalist website as evidence of the film’s racial hierarchy.
He goes on like that for some time, arguing that Disney's "Mary Poppins" reboot likewise suffers from problematic racial stereotypes. He also posits that "Disney has long evoked minstrelsy for its topsy-turvy entertainments — a nanny blacking up, chimney sweeps mocking the upper classes, grinning lamplighters turning work into song."

There’s a lot going on here, but the article is mostly a collection of supplemental data points used to make the larger argument that Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke covering their faces in soot for a song-and-dance number with grimy, working-class chimney sweeps is, at the heart of it, “blackface.”

One problem with this argument is that it relies a great deal on materials that are not found in the movie itself. Pollack-Pelzner asks that we consider several outside examples of so-called "problematic" (ugh) incidents found only in the Mary Poppins books. He also asks that we consider similarly "problematic" materials found in separate Disney properties, such as old Mickey Mouse cartoons. From these considerations, the author asks that we accept that the “Step in Time” bit from the 1964 movie is a cockney’d-up minstrel show.

That’s a big ask. And it never occurs to Pollack-Pelzner to ask himself whether the fun isn't just truly innocent, or whether logical stretches and guilt by association are perhaps not the best determiners of whether a thing is, in fact, racist.

Now, to be fair, Pollack-Pelzner does make a good point when he cites the admiral shouting in the film, "We’re being attacked by Hottentots!” That's a clear homage to the exact sort of problems the author highlights in the film's source material. But to refer to Julie Andrews daintily applying soot to her face while dancing with chimney sweeps as "blacking up"? Come on. What next, will chimneys be considered racist?

Perhaps the better argument would be to stop ruining good fun that isn't racist, and instead point to the things that really are, like those very old Mickey Mouse cartoons.

At any rate, if there's anyone who should feel aggrieved by the 1964 movie, it’s the British. Never before have a people been so poorly imitated.

Here's how people are reacting to Elizabeth Warren's 'wealth tax' proposal

Texto completo: Senator Elizabeth Warren is pushing a novel tax idea as one of the first major proposals of her nascent presidential campaign: A tax on the wealth of the super rich.
Her plan would differ from previous left-wing tax proposals in a huge way: It's a tax on wealth, rather than income. She said her proposal would affect the “tippy-top" of the American economic scale, or those with a net worth of more than $50 million. Specifically, it would impose a 2 percent annual tax on household wealth between $50 million and $1 billion, and an additional 1 percent annual “billionaire surtax" for a net worth above $1 billion.
“After making a killing on the economy they've rigged, they don't pay taxes on that accumulated wealth," Warren said of the super-rich in a video posted to her Twitter account last week.
Her proposal has drawn reaction from a number of corners — with some particularly stinging criticism coming from the very people her plan would affect. Here's a rundown of the critics and fans.
Michael Bloomberg: At an event in New Hampshire on Tuesday, Bloomberg, who is considering a run for the Democratic nomination, made comparisons with Venezuela when asked about Warren's plan.
“We need a healthy economy, and we shouldn't be embarrassed about our system," he said to reporters after a factory tour. “If you want to look at a system that's non-capitalistic, just take a look at what was once, perhaps, the wealthiest country in the world, and today people are starving to death. It's called Venezuela."
Bloomberg has a net worth of more than $50 billion, according to Forbes.
Howard Schultz: The billionaire former Starbucks CEO, who has been laying the groundwork for a possible independent presidential bid, had harsh language for Warren's tax proposal, dismissing it as a “good headline" in an interview on NPR's “Morning Edition."
“When I see Elizabeth Warren come out with a ridiculous plan of taxing wealthy people a surtax of 2 percent because it makes a good headline or sends out a tweet when she knows for a fact that's not something that's ever gonna be passed, this is what's wrong," he said. “You can't just attack these things in a punitive way by punishing people."
Paul Krugman: Warren's plan drew lofty comparisons to Teddy Roosevelt from the New York Times columnist. He cited the early 20th century president (who was himself the benefactor of an inherited fortune) in his praise of Warren's tax plan, which he called both “radical" and “impressive."
“It's true that the Warren plan would limit the ability of the already incredibly wealthy to make their fortunes even bigger, and pass them on to their heirs. But slowing or reversing our drift toward a society ruled by oligarchic dynasties is a feature, not a bug," he wrote.
Felicia Wong: Another expert, at the Roosevelt Institute, talked about the effect such a plan would have not just on economic inequality but racial inequality in America. Studies have shown that there is a yawning wealth gap between black and white Americans that is compounded as wealth is passed from one generation to another.
A 2017 Spotlight report drew attention to a startling statistic in Boston: African-American households had a median networth of just $8, while for white households, the figure was $247,500.
“Wealth, which is passed on through generations, is a kind of crystalized history, and the black-white wealth gap is astounding compared to the black-white income gap, which is closer to a 40 percent differential. The fact that we are talking about taxing wealth will have very significant implications on closing that black wealth gap and that's a very big deal," Wong told Vice News.

No experience? Please; Given that plenty of other 'novices' have run for president, a New Age guru deserves a shot too

Texto completo: In a country that elected a uniquely unqualified man to the presidency in 2016, it's no longer rational to dismiss a presidential candidate simply for lack of experience.
Lack of money, yes.
Lack of political experience? Give me a break.

And yet, when Marianne Williamson -- bestselling author, self-help guru, AIDs activist and friend of Oprah -- tweeted Monday that she was about to launch a campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, the replies on her feed ranged from mildly negative to brutal.
"Why wouldn't you run for local/state government first? Why is everyone jumping straight to president these days?" one tweeter asked.
"So all the bored rich people of the US now believe that 'Playing President' is just like buying a membership at an elite country club, clearly! YOU ARE NOT QUALIFIED," another said.
Oh qualified, schmalified. As Williamson points out, the Constitution says you have to be 35 and a natural-born citizen to run for president. That's it.
Anyway, she is not a political novice. In 2014, she ran for Congress, raised $2 million and placed fourth in a field of 16.
In 2010, she created Sister Giant, an annual conference to engage more women in politics, both as candidates and activists.
There were other negative reactions too. Some accused Williamson of trying to raise her profile to sell more books.
But her profile is already pretty damn high.
She has 2.6 million Twitter followers -- more than U.S. Sens. Kamala Harris and Kirsten Gillibrand, both of whom are running for the Democratic nomination.
She has written 12 books, seven of them New York Times bestsellers. Her breakout 1992 bestseller, "A Return to Love," incorporated the teachings of "A Course in Miracles," a popular spiritual self-help movement about the transformative power of love and forgiveness.
Williamson is also a veteran social activist who founded Project Angel Food, which for nearly 30 years has delivered meals to homebound people with AIDs.
As someone who has covered presidential campaigns since 2004, I can tell you that voters will give a listen to almost any candidate with a resonant message.
After all, in the 2012 presidential race, Republicans took businessman Herman Cain seriously. In 2011, U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann won the Ames Straw Poll.
The Rev. Al Sharpton, whose campaign focused on poverty and racial justice, did well enough in the 2004 Democratic primaries to debate with Sens. John Kerry and John Edwards.
And of course, Ross Perot had never run for anything and still managed to garner 18.9% of the popular vote as an independent in 1992.
::
At the Saban Theatre in Beverly Hills on Monday night, Williamson, 66, stood at a clear podium in front of a massive, "Patton"-esque American flag. She wore a short, fitted black jacket and a long black skirt, a severe look for such a celebratory moment.
The theater held hundreds of supporters and fans of her self-help ministry. Her 35 years of experience as a public speaker, teacher and pastor will serve her well if her candidacy goes anywhere. She is a charismatic orator, funny and erudite and passionate. She spoke for 40 minutes without notes or a teleprompter.
She spoke about her life -- about her father, a successful immigration attorney, who taught her not just to look but to see -- her anti-Vietnam War activism, her work as a "metaphysician," someone who teaches spiritual lessons.
She quoted Louis Brandeis, Martin Luther King Jr. and Gandhi. She spoke about the importance of investing in children, the scandal of child poverty in America. When she advocated reparations for slavery, her supporters, who were mostly white, erupted in applause. "There is a still a debt to be paid," she said.
Her message seems perfectly in tune with the Democratic Party's left wing. She is a progressive populist and does not object to being compared to Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.
"Previously, our social agreement was such that we expected corporations to have a sense of ethical responsibility to workers, their community, the environment," she told me during a phone conversation Monday afternoon. "But market forces-above-all, no matter who gets hurt, has replaced democracy as our organizing principle."
::
Because she speaks of the importance of love and compassion, about morality and spirituality, she may seem to some to be a walking, talking California stereotype.
"She's blending woo woo with politics, my two favorite things," said Jeanne Mahaffey, 39, a receptionist for a real estate firm who came to hear Williamson speak Monday. "She is talking about the stuff that no one ever talks about in a realistic, mature manner. Like reparations, taxes, the environment. It's not just pretty words that protect the feelings of the powerful."
But what about that "woo woo" thing?
"She is soft and love-centered, and that comes across to some people as weak," Mahaffey said. "But in a world full of Proud Boys and John Wayne swagger, I think that's brave."
Williamson herself rejects any notion that she's some kind of spiritual goofball.
"I'm a serious woman," she said. "I've had a serious career."
As she has pointed out in the past, Martin Luther King Jr. "wasn't called a New Age nutcase or considered an intellectual lightweight" for emphasizing the power of love.
But love, as all presidential candidates know, is not all you need.
"I'd like $2 million tonight, please," she told the crowd.
I sat next to a man who looked as if he might have been at home in a Wall Street boardroom. He told me he was a Republican investment banker from New York and a friend of Williamson. He planned to donate his allowed maximum of $2,700 that evening.
He wouldn't tell me whether he thought she could win the nomination.
"She brings a marvelous dimension to the conversation," he said. "The American public needs this."

LAUSD teachers should exercise their Janus rights, not follow their union off a fiscal cliff

Texto completo: Despite the recent settlement of the Los Angeles teachers strike, mostly in the teacher union’s favor, the deal largely ignores the shaky financial realities of the school district. While the union crows about its apparent victory, the potential fiscal disaster should make teachers consider leaving the union, not rallying around it.
In addition to a 6 percent raise for teachers, the settlement deal includes more staff at schools and a cap on class sizes. Yet, the district’s finances mean that the deal is built on quicksand.
As the New York Times pointed out, “the deal essentially punted on the question of how the district would come up with the $403 million to pay for the additional staff members.”
Further, the district can only afford the deal if it can pass a local parcel tax in 2020 and receive increased state funding from Sacramento.
These glaring financial questions clash with the district’s current bottom line.
For example, state law requires the district to maintain a minimum 1 percent budget reserve, and the district has a structural deficit, spending more than it takes in.
That structural deficit will soon end up causing the district to dip below the state-mandated 1 percent minimum.
Los Angeles County Office of Education superintendent Debra Duardo recently told the education group Speak Up, “it’s gotten to the point where [the district] can’t show us that they can maintain a 1 percent reserve in their third year out.”
The County estimates that by 2021-22, “the district will be bankrupt.”
Duardo points out, “Especially at a district as large as LAUSD, if they were to go insolvent, then they would be in really big trouble.”
What kind of trouble? For teachers, here is the chilling warning.
The district, says Duardo, “would actually run out of the cash they need to pay their teachers and all of their salaries.”
Duardo explains that a budget reserve is a one-time pot of cash, and “that’s not money you [will] have [again in the future].”
In response to a question about the district giving in to the union’s demands, Duardo is clear about the ramifications: “The law is set up where if they were to show us in their budget that they don’t have enough money to maintain that reserve, and even go further into the negative — which would concern us that they may be at risk of becoming insolvent — then the next step would be for us to assign a fiscal advisor.”
The kicker: “And a fiscal advisor has stay-and-rescind authority, which means that if there are decisions being made that put the district at risk of becoming insolvent, then we could override decisions that the board is making.”
The union claims that the district is not deficit spending, but Duardo points to the simple fiscal fact that the district’s reserve is plunging, so if there were no deficit spending “we wouldn’t see this reserve dwindling down to below 1 percent.”
The new settlement deal, therefore, may be a Pyrrhic victory for teachers that could cause harm to them and their students.
Instead of blindly following their union, teachers should consider taking advantage of their new rights under the Supreme Court’s Janus decision, which held that public employees cannot be forced to pay dues or fees to unions.
Justice Samuel Alito, who authored the Janus majority opinion, wrote that it is an unconstitutional infringement on the rights of public employees to require them “to provide financial support for a union that ‘takes many positions during collective bargaining that have powerful political and civic consequences.’”
L.A. teachers should make use of their Janus rights and walk away from the union, not walk with it over a cliff.

FSU honors MLK's legacy as 'more than the dream'

Texto completo: This past week, FSU commemorated the life and work of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. during its 31st Annual MLK Week. It started on Jan. 15 with a block party hosted by six identity based agencies and ended on Jan. 22 with a Golden Tribe lecture. The events all fell under the theme of "More than the Dream."
This year's celebration also included a screening of "The Hate U Give" at the Student Life Cinema, the Dare to Dream Festival and an opportunity to engage in dialogue about Tallahassee's civil right history at the "Discovering The Past" event.
To close out MLK week, FSU hosted "An Evening with Charles Blow," featuring a New York Times columnist, author and political commentator. Winners and participants were also announced for the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Distinguished Service Awards, the FSU Diversity & Inclusion Certificate and the annual Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Book Stipend awards.
"What an incredible event that was to see all our young people from across our county, come together and celebrate and honor the legacy of this great man, Martin Luther King Jr.," President John Thrasher said, reflecting on MLK week.
Thrasher expressed his hope that future generations – the current students of Florida State and beyond – will embody the values of MLK and remain vigilant in promoting them.
"We know that we still have work to do; we know we do," said Thrasher. "But we also have faith, as Dr. King did, that the moral arc of the universe bends towards justice. And more than any generation before, our students value contributions from different cultures' ethnicity. They understand that diversity enriches the quality of life and that different points of view are necessary for a dynamic learning environment."
Blow's speech centered around how MLK's politics shifted throughout his lifetime and how they can be applied to society now.
"Very few things in America happen by accident," Blow said. "Concentrated poverty is not by chance but by design, and our present culture rests on a profound historical context."
Blow went on to critique the myth of "pulling yourself up by bootstraps," an idea that anyone can work hard enough to reach any level of success, regardless of circumstance.
"America is still profiting from oppression, bleeding money from black and brown flesh," Blow said. "We need to dismantle the architecture that supports structural racism."
Blow suggests that this structural racism can be seen in things like the prison industrial complex or even in the police force, which he says vacillates freely between "protect and serve, and punish and profit."
"Just because one abhors violence and cruelty does not mean that one truly believes that all people are equal culturally, intellectually, morally," Blow said. "Entertaining the notion of imbalance that white people are inherently better than other people in any way is also white supremacy."
Blow emphasized the importance of challenging America's commitment to equality and holding leaders accountable.
"We need to be willing enough, strong enough and brave enough to keep fighting for real justice," Blow said.
Winners of the 2019 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Book Stipend awards.

Texto completo: Charles Kettles - The Medal of Honor winner who saved the lives of 44 men in the Vietnam War has died.
He retired from the Army in 1978 at the rank of lieutenant colonel and was 89 when he died Monday (Jan. 21, 2019) at his home in Ypsilanti, Mich. The cause was lung cancer, said his son Mike Kettles.
On May 15, 1967, amid punishing fire from the North Vietnamese, then-Maj. Kettles piloted his helicopter in four times to deliver reinforcements to the outnumbered members of the 101st Airborne Division, and to evacuate the wounded and the dead.
He was credited with saving the lives of 44 men and received the Distinguished Service Cross, the military's second-highest award for valor, for his actions.
Nearly half a century later, the award was upgraded to the Medal of Honor. President Barack Obama bestowed the medal on him in 2016.
Nathan Glazer - The prominent sociologist and public intellectual who assisted on a classic study of conformity, "The Lonely Crowd," and co-authored a groundbreaking document of nonconformity, "Beyond the Melting Pot," has died at 95.
Mr. Glazer's daughter, Sarah Glazer, confirmed her father died at his home in Cambridge, Mass., on Jan. 19 (2019).
A longtime professor at Harvard University, Mr. Glazer was among the last of the deeply read thinkers who influenced culture and politics in the mid-20th century.
Starting in the 1940s, Mr. Glazer was a writer and editor for Commentary and The New Republic. He was a co-editor of The Public Interest, and wrote or co-wrote numerous books.
Russell Baker - The genial but sharp-witted writer, who won Pulitzer Prizes for his humorous columns in The New York Times and a moving autobiography of his impoverished Baltimore childhood -- and later hosted television's "Masterpiece Theatre" -- has died. He was 93.
His son Allen Baker said Mr. Baker died Monday (Jan. 21, 2019) from complications after a fall.
In his later years, Mr. Baker lived in Leesburg, Va., not far from the rural Loudoun County community where he was born.
Amiable and approachable, but also clear-eyed and street smart, Mr. Baker enjoyed a decadeslong career as reporter, columnist, critic and on-air personality. He won Pulitzers in 1979 for the "Observer," the Times column he wrote for 35 years, and in 1983 for his autobiography "Growing Up."
Andy Vajna - The Hungarian-American movie producer, who worked on several "Rambo" movies with Sylvester Stallone, "Total Recall" with Arnold Schwarzen-egger and Madonna's "Evita," has died. He was 74.
Mr. Vajna, who produced many other movies, died Jan. 20 (2019) at his home in Budapest after a long illness, Hungary's National Film Fund said.
Mr. Vajna was also owner of the TV2 Group, a Hungarian company that owns several television channels, including TV2, one of Hungary's two main broadcasters and politically aligned closely with Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government.
Since 2011, Mr. Vajna had been a commissioner in the Orban government, in charge of developing Hungary's movie industry.

Diana Athill - The writer and editor who honed the work of novelists including John Updike and Margaret Atwood, before finding late-life fame as a memoirist, has died. She was 101.
Publisher Granta Books said Ms. Athill died Wednesday (Jan. 23, 2019) after a short illness.
Ms. Athill worked for the BBC in World War II and later co-founded the Andre Deutsch publishing house. She worked there as an editor for five decades, nurturing writers including Updike, Philip Roth, Norman Mailer, Jean Rhys and V.S. Naipaul.
Ms. Athill published a memoir, "Instead of a Letter" -- an account of an unhappy wartime love affair -- in 1963 and went on to produce several more volumes, recounting life as a woman in a male-dominated literary world. "Stet: An Editor's Life," published by Granta in 2000, was among the best known.
Harris Wofford - The former senator from Pennsylvania, a longtime civil rights activist who helped persuade John F. Kennedy to make a crucial phone call to the wife of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. during the 1960 presidential campaign, has died. He was 92.
Mr. Wofford died in a hospital late Monday night (Jan. 21, 2019) of complications from a fall Saturday in his Washington apartment, his son Daniel Wofford said.
Kennedy's phone call to Coretta Scott King when her husband was locked in a Georgia prison cell in 1960 is credited by some analysts with turning the black vote in his favor and perhaps proving to be the decisive factor in the race against Republican Richard Nixon.
Mr. Wofford went on to serve as a civil rights aide to Kennedy during his administration and worked in private law practice, higher education and Pennsylvania state government until his upset Senate win in 1991. He became Pennsylvania's first Democratic U.S. senator in a generation.
Mr. Wofford, who was white, began his activism in high school. Visits to India left him inspired by Mohandas K. Gandhi, and he marched with King. He co-founded Kennedy's Peace Corps, directed AmeriCorps under President Bill Clinton, and helped establish the Martin Luther King Day of Service.
He was an aide and friend to Democratic presidents over a span of decades.
Kaye Ballard - The boisterous comedian and singer, who appeared in Broadway musicals and nightclubs from New York to Las Vegas and starred with Eve Arden in the 1960s TV sitcom "The Mothers-In-Law," has died. She was 93.
Ms. Ballard died Monday night (Jan. 21, 2019) at her home in Rancho Mirage, Calif., of kidney cancer, her friend Marguerite Gordon said Tuesday.
"The Mothers-In-Law" aired from 1967 to 1969. It marked a high point in a career that began when Ms. Ballard was 12 and lasted into the 21st century.
She was on hand this month when a documentary on her life and career premiered at the Palm Springs International Film Festival.
Maxine Brown Russell - The singer who, together with her brother Jim Ed Brown and sister Bonnie Brown, formed the country trio the Browns, has died. She was 87.
Martha Moore, a publicist working with the family, said Ms. Russell died surrounded by her family on Monday (Jan. 21, 2019) in hospice care in Little Rock, Ark.
A songwriter and singer, Ms. Russell and her siblings launched their careers on the "Louisiana Hayride" in the 1950s and had a several chart-topping songs in the '50s and '60s, including "The Three Bells," "The Old Lamplighter," "Scarlet Ribbons" and "Send Me the Pillow You Dream On."
They appeared on TV on shows including "The Ed Sullivan Show," "American Bandstand" and "The Jerry Lewis Show."
The Browns were inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2015.
John Mendelsohn - The physician-scientist and hospital administrator who pioneered a new form of cancer therapy, before growing the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center into one of the world's pre-eminent cancer hospitals, died Jan. 7 (2019) at his home in Houston. He was 82.
The cause was glioblastoma, a form of brain cancer, his son Eric Mendelsohn said.
As just the third president in MD Anderson's 55-year history, Dr. Mendelsohn helped steer the Houston institution toward international renown, building it into a formidable center for research, education and patient care.
Earlier, he had studied thousands of antibodies, isolating one in 1984 that prevented a protein from binding with a receptor on the outside of cancer cells, in effect halting the proliferation of those cancers. Dubbed C-225, it formed the basis of cetuximab, also known by the trade name Erbitux.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the drug for the treatment of colorectal cancer in 2004 and for head and neck cancer in 2006.
Michel Legrand - The French composer died Saturday (Jan. 26, 2019) at 86. The death was announced on his website, but no other details were provided.
Mr. Legrand had more than 200 screen credits, notably the jazzy movie operas "The Umbrellas of Cherbourg" and "The Young Girls of Rochefort"; and his tunefully romantic music for "The Thomas Crown Affair," "Summer of '42" and "Yentl" brought him Oscars.
After a run of hitmaking jazz albums, including collaborations with trumpeter Miles Davis and saxophonist John Coltrane, Legrand drew international attention in 1964 with "The Umbrellas of Cherbourg." Director Jacques Demy's melancholy musical was about an auto mechanic (Nino Castelnuovo) and a shop owner's daughter (Catherine Deneuve) who fall in love in the French coastal city but are driven apart by war and circumstance.
Every word of dialogue was sung.

Texto completo: A rite of summer for South Florida music fans, the annual two-night residency by the Dave Matthews Band at Coral Sky Amphitheatre in West Palm Beach will be July 26-27 this year.
The back-to-back concerts are part of DMB's 2019 North American tour that kicks off April 30 in Pensacola. The band will play Jacksonville the next night before hitting the rest of the continent, eventually circling back to Florida for a show in Tampa on July 24 and the West Palm Beach concerts.
South Florida is one of six stops on the 34-city tour to get multiple concerts.
Tickets for the North American dates go on sale Feb. 22, but a presale for Dave Matthews fans is under way at Warehouse.DaveMatthewsBand.com, running through 3 p.m. Monday, Feb. 4. Citi card members will have access to presale tickets Feb. 19-21.
The fan-club presale includes general tickets, premium packages, and opportunities for general-admission pit upgrades and meet-and-greet sessions.
Each ticket purchase includes access to a download of an unreleased live recording from DMB's 2018 tour. Visit Redeem.DaveMatthewsBand.com for more information.
Matthews and band will warm up for summer with a month-long European tour beginning March 6 in Munich, Germany. The band just concluded its 2018 tour in December, punctuated by a free show on Miami Beach during the Orange Bowl Beach Bash. Those concerts supported the 2018 album "Come Tomorrow," which made DMB the first group to have seven consecutive studio albums debut at No. 1 on the Billboard 200.
The New York Times captured the essence of the album, saying "willed optimism fills the songs on 'Come Tomorrow,' while cynicism and irony are nowhere within earshot."

Texto completo: An American who was captured by Syrian Democratic Forces in Syria is being detained in the U.S. and has been charged with attempting to provide material support to the Islamic State.

Warren Christopher Clark, a former substitute teacher in Sugar Land, Texas, had applied to teach English to students within ISIS and was captured earlier this month by U.S.-backed Kurdish forces. U.S. law enforcement took custody of him this week, and he arrived in Houston on Thursday.

Clark appeared in a Houston federal court Friday and has been charged with attempting to provide himself as material support to ISIS, according to an indictment that was unsealed Friday.

In a recent interview Clark, who said executions and crucifixions were part of “normal life” in Syria, entered ISIS territory three years ago. But he did not fight for ISIS.

"I wanted to go see exactly what the group was about, and what they were doing," Clark told NBC News this month. "Of course I saw the videos. I think with the beheadings, that's execution. I'm from the United States, from Texas. They like to execute people, too. So I really don't see any difference. They might do it off camera, but it's the same."

After Clark was captured, his father Warren Clark denied that his son was part of ISIS and claimed his “son would not be involved in anything along those lines.”

“My son doesn’t have an evil thought in his mind about hurting anyone,” Warren Clark told the New York Times.

Clark could have to pay a fine of $250,000, if he’s convicted, and could spend up to 20 years behind bars.

“The FBI continues to aggressively pursue individuals who attempt to join the ranks of ISIS’s foreign fighters or try to provide support for other terrorist organizations. This fight against terrorism is not one we can combat alone,” special agent in charge of the FBI’s Houston Field Office, Perrye Turner, said in a statement.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Joni Ernst was elected to the Senate in 2014 after a campaign portraying her as a "Mother. Soldier. Independent Leader," a Harley-riding, target-shooting veteran of the Iraq war who, she said at the time, was "not running on my gender."
This week Ms. Ernst, Republican of Iowa, said there was another element to her identity, one that came to light only after highly personal details related to her divorce inadvertently became public: She is a survivor of sexual assault.
In interviews, Ms. Ernst, a member of the Senate Republican leadership, said she had been a victim of spousal abuse and campus rape.
"What I want people to understand is that I am the same person as I was last week. You just know more about what's inside of me now," she said during a videotaped interview, struggling to keep her composure.
She said she had not yet wanted to reveal what had happened to her, and was speaking out now only because the divorce filings had briefly become public before being sealed.
"I was not ready to talk about my situation," Ms. Ernst said in a Bloomberg News interview this week, during which she addressed the end of her marriage and also revealed that she was raped while in college. A spokeswoman for Ms. Ernst declined a request for an interview by The New York Times.
"I am a survivor, and I fully believe that our survivors have the right to keep their stories to themselves if they don't want to share those stories or are not ready to share those stories," Ms. Ernst, who is running for re-election in 2020, told reporters during a visit to Iowa on Wednesday.
"I will always continue to work with survivors and provide them the best possible resources I can," she said. She said that she would leverage her new role on the Senate Judiciary Committee "to get the Violence Against Women Act reauthorized."
"We have to modernize it," she continued. "We have to reauthorize it. It was allowed to expire last fall and that shouldn't happen."
Ms. Ernst's story drew expressions of shock and support from lawmakers of both parties.
"My heart goes out to her," Representative Debbie Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, said on CNN on Thursday.
A conservative favorite, Ms. Ernst was interviewed as a potential running mate for Donald J. Trump during the 2016 campaign. She declined to be considered, citing family concerns, the court documents showed.
"I understand it's newsworthy, but this is a huge violation of her privacy," said Karen Kedrowski, director of the Carrie Chapman Catt Center for Women and Politics at Iowa State University. "It would not surprise me if some people would see a disconnect between her personal experience and public positions and see this as hypocrisy. But I think that undercuts the human capacity to compartmentalize and see personal experience in a different frame of reference."
The release of the court documents meant Ms. Ernst lost control of her own story. But her decision to speak publicly put her in the company of other women who have had to balance forthrightness and transparency about traumatic experiences against the potential loss of privacy and other negative effects on their lives and careers.
In Congress, Ms. Ernst and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, have advocated on behalf of victims of sexual assault in the military. On a visit to Iowa last spring, Ms. Ernst promised to seek more reliable federal funding for Iowa's Rape Victim Advocacy Program, whose leaders complained that state budget cuts had defunded the state's 24-hour sexual abuse hotline and forced the advocacy program to cut staffing.
But Ms. Ernst was also among female legislators casting doubt on the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford, the educator whose allegations of high school sexual assault by Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh nearly derailed his Supreme Court nomination.
"I'm glad that she is here, and it's important that we hear from her," Ms. Ernst told reporters at the time. "However, the other statements provided by those witnesses have contradicted what she is stating." Ms. Ernst voted to confirm Justice Kavanaugh.
"Honestly, I don't think she's thinking about the politics of this," said Dave Kochel, a Republican strategist who worked on Ms. Ernst's Senate campaign and is close to her. "This is much more about trying to maintain her dignity and privacy through something that is very difficult."
The court documents were filed as part of Ms. Ernst's divorce from her husband, Gail Ernst, which was finalized this month. In the filings, Ms. Ernst said she was emotionally and physically abused by Mr. Ernst, whom she met while both were serving in the military, according to a summary of the filings first reported by Cityview, an alternative newspaper based in Des Moines.
Ms. Ernst said in the documents that her husband assaulted her after she confronted him about an alleged affair with the family's babysitter. She said she fled the family's home with their daughter, and met with a victims' advocate who wanted to take her to the hospital. She declined, she said, "because I was embarrassed and humiliated and didn't want anyone to know about the assault."
The Cityview story quotes Ms. Ernst as saying in the documents: "Gail agreed to go to counseling at Offutt Air Force Base to repair our marriage, but he told me not to bring up the assault in our counseling sessions. I stupidly agreed. We moved on, although things have never really been the same."
Mr. Ernst alleged in the divorce proceedings that Ms. Ernst had an affair with a man under her command while the couple was in the military. He has not commented publicly since the court documents were released. Ms. Ernst denied that allegation on Wednesday, telling reporters in Iowa, "That is not accurate and I was a company commander overseas and took that job very, very seriously."

Amy Iverson: How much phone usage is healthy? It may depend on your generation

Texto completo: When a notification pings, many people will immediately bring whatever they’re doing to a halt in order to check their phone. The task the person puts on hold could be a work project, or a conversation with a real live person sitting across the table.
A recent study published in NeuroRegulation says that’s because people with digital addiction have behaviors that mimic those of substance abuse addiction. Erik Peper, Ph.D., a professor at San Francisco State University, said we get addicted because we get pleasure from the quick feedback. He explained our phones almost always win our attention because we are wired to react to visual stimuli.
“It’s done totally automatically,” he said, “even subconsciously.”
But there are problems with this natural reaction. Peper has noticed a big change in his students in the last five years: “I used to come to class and students would all be talking with one another. Now I come to class and they’re all with their heads down looking at their cell phones. We are more connected and yet more people are socially isolated and people are depressed.”
But another study, part of a 2016 dissertation, has a different take. Rowan University assistant professor Matthew Pittman, Ph.D., had been seeing so much negative press about phone use, he wondered if there might be some redeeming qualities. His study looked at the relationship between social media and loneliness and whether these apps connected people in a meaningful way. He said he was unsurprised by the findings.
“Most social media are helpful to a point,” he said, “they just have a point of diminishing returns.”
With each platform he tested, there was a specific amount of time used that would result in the least amount of loneliness. Using much more than that, or much less, and the student felt more loneliness. For Snapchat, the magic number was 30 minutes per day. The optimal time spent on Facebook was 45 minutes, with 60 minutes for texting and 90 minutes for Instagram. Pittman said these forms of communication can be fine if people use them to strengthen existing real world relationships, “But once you’re using Instagram for two or three hours a day, then you’re not supporting existing relationships. You’re then usurping or subverting the things you meant to support.”
Peper’s study supports this idea regarding people who consistently use their phones while in a social setting.
“If my phone signals me and I turn away from someone in front of me,” he said, “that person will feel dismissed.” He noted that the more people use phones in social settings, the more they report feeling lonely.
And he still believes real world communication is better for relationships than digital ones where we lose the nuances of pitch and inflection of voices.
“Which do you like better,” he asked, “an actual message or a virtual message?”
Pittman adds the generational aspect of social media usage is also important. He cited the recent New York Times analysis of Spotify data that found that whatever music is our favorite when we are in our teen years will continue to be so throughout our adult lives. He says it’s the same with the amount of face-to-face time people need with others to feel connected. Since older generations didn’t grow up using cell phones, they may need more physical togetherness to maintain a relationship. But the younger generations who have always communicated with one another through texting and apps may not.
“It’s whatever we’re comfortable with,” he said. “Whatever we used a lot as teenagers is whatever we think is normal.”
Are you using your phone to avoid human interaction? Is your phone use taking away from the time you could spend enhancing your real life relationships?
If so, Peper proposes some strategies to regain social connections, including completely turning off digital devices during social events. He also recommends turning off notifications that can act as a steady stream of interruptions while working or playing. And finally, set specific times of the day when you will look at and respond to social media. Peper suggests letting your contacts know the hours they can expect to get responses from you.
Trusting oneself and observing how social media and texting make you feel is the bottom line for Pittman.
“If you think it’s connecting you with other people when you use it, then it’s good for you,” he said. “And if you don’t, then using it is going to be frustrating and you’re going to compare yourself to others.”

Democrats will need a better brand of populism than Donald Trump's to win in 2020

Texto completo: Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson recently unleashed a rant against elite-driven capitalism. Carlson believes, Jane Coaston wrote in Vox, that “some version of populism is necessary to prevent a full-scale political revolt or the onset of socialism. ” Then Jonathan Martin of The New York Times wrote, “Perhaps the most consequential political question facing the Democratic Party … is whether voters will rally behind the candidate most capable of defeating the president even if that Democrat is imperfect on some issues. ”
Carlson understands something that many mainstream Democrats, and mainstream political analysts in general, are missing. We are in a populist moment in America — but populism doesn’t just come in one form. For Democrats, there’s no trade-off between picking a candidate who can win and picking a candidate who will fight for progressive populism. Indeed, only a candidate who does both is viable in 2020.
In recent history, the term populism has been conflated with the rise of right-wing mass political movements in America and Europe, but in fact the concept has a much longer and ideologically complex arc and can refer to any political engagement or framing that pits “the people” against “the elites. ”
Historian Lawrence Goodwyn traced populism in the United States to the late 1900s, when Southern and Midwestern farmers formed cooperatives to leverage their market power against increasingly powerful banking interests — setting off an era of progressive populism. Historian Thomas Frank argues that populism as a right-wing force in America didn’t really take shape until 1968, “when George Wallace and Richard Nixon figured out how to turn the language of working-class majoritarianism against liberalism. ”
Read more commentary:
The Rust Belt is done with Donald Trump's gold-plated populism
Populism is powerful because Washington deserves a kick in the pants
What Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders don't get: Free trade is the real populism.
We are entering another populist era. Donald Trump had his finger on this pulse when he ran in 2016. Of course, Trump is a weird avatar for anti-elitism, but so were Nixon and Wallace. Politics is always half performance. At the same time, for all the sexism that undoubtedly harangued Hillary Clinton’s 2016 candidacy, it would have been harder to find a more definitive representative of the sort of elite politics that was quickly going out of vogue. Notably, 1 out of 10 people who supported Sen. Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary ultimately cast their votes for Trump. There are a lot of possible explanations for why, but certainly a factor is a shared hunger for sticking it to the elites, a tone both men struck.
What does all this mean for 2020? That there is no trade-off between picking the candidate who can beat Trump versus picking the candidate who articulates a bold, progressive pluralistic vision. In fact, the only Democratic candidate who can beat Trump in 2020 is a Democratic candidate who authentically and powerfully stands for a bottom-up political and economic vision that puts the needs of Main Street communities ahead of Wall Street cronies.
2020 election will define our version of populism
The 2020 election will be a referendum on what version of populism will define the United States for generations to come — Trump’s exclusionary, nativist, hate-fueled version or an inclusive, democratic, populism for all. Only a Democratic candidate who can fight on that terrain, who in fact understands that terrain and brings a values-based vision to the fight, will suit the political and cultural moment and present a real and clear contrast to Trump.
Indeed, inclusive populism is what helped Democrats sweep the House in 2018. The Progressive Change Campaign Committee’s analysis of the 2018 midterms found that “up and down the ballot, Democrats won by positioning themselves as advocates for working people — willing to challenge power and shake up a rigged political and economic system in order to make a tangible difference in the lives of their constituents. ” About 70 percent of Americans support Medicare for all, and 65 percent of the incoming House freshman class embraced some version of Medicare for all or expansion of Social Security benefits. As Adam Green, co-founder of PCCC writes, “This reveals a clear path to victory for any Democrat thinking about running for president in 2020. ”
There shouldn’t be Democratic litmus tests for 2020 — the very point of inclusive populism is a big tent, where all ideas and all debates are welcome. But the simple fact is that the only candidate who can beat Trump in 2020 and lead America away from exclusionary, hateful nativist populism toward a better future for all is a candidate who inherently understands and has a demonstrated track record in the philosophy, values, policies of inclusive, people-first, radically egalitarian populism for all. That’s the candidate whom Tucker Carlson and Donald Trump are most afraid of. And that’s the candidate America needs.

Texto completo: Americans might soon learn what, if anything, special counsel Robert Mueller has found out about potential collusion between Donald Trump's presidential campaign and Russia.
But there's one Trump-Moscow link where the emerging evidence is already as damning as it is disturbing.
During much, if not all, of Trump's campaign he sought to enrich himself by pursuing a luxury hotel-condominium-office deal in Russia known as Trump Tower Moscow.
And as a candidate, Trump repeatedly misled or lied to voters about his business with Russia. "I have nothing to do with Russia," he told reporters in July 2016. "I don't deal there," he said during the Oct. 9 presidential debate.
The truth is, Trump had coveted a lucrative hotel project in Russia — whether to build one or license his name to be emblazoned on a skyscraper — for decades. "We will be in Moscow at some point," he said in a 2007 deposition.
Later, as a presidential candidate, he secretly signed an 18-page letter of intent for Trump Tower Moscow on Oct. 28, 2015, the day of the third Republican presidential debate.
Court filings by Mueller in November make clear that negotiations led by Trump lawyer Michael Cohen continued through at least June 2016. Cohen lied about this to Congress to "give the false impression that the Moscow Project ended before 'the Iowa caucus and ... the very first primary,' " according to the filings.
You have to wonder what the fallout would have been if those negotiations had been exposed before Trump debated his Republican primary opponents or Hillary Clinton. The electorate certainly was robbed of knowing about this crucial information at a time when:
There were news reports that Russia was interfering in the election.
Trump was expressing praise and admiration for President Vladimir Putin, even as he was insulting hundreds of other people, places and things on Twitter.
The candidate said that, as president, he would consider easing sanctions placed against Russia for its violent seizure of Crimea.
Trump was questioning America's continued role in NATO, a bulwark against Russian aggression that Putin has historically despised.
A plank in the GOP platform regarding U.S. support for Ukraine was watered down.
Trump challenged Moscow to release Democratic emails that Russians were reported to have hacked.
How does the president explain the appearance of a quid pro quo? By claiming that he was just keeping his options open. "There was a good chance that I wouldn't have won," Trump said in November, "in which case I would have gotten back into the (real estate development) business. And why should I lose lots of opportunities?"
Exactly when the Trump Tower Moscow "opportunity" collapsed remains murky. On Sunday, the president's current lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, quoted Trump as telling him that project talks were "going on from the day I announced to the day I won." By Monday, Giuliani was scrambling to walk back his comments to The New York Times and other news outlets.
But whether Trump was pursuing the arrangement until he clinched the Republican nomination, or right up until he was elected president, isn't the main point. What matters is that a presidential candidate was secretly negotiating a major business deal with a major U.S. adversary — an extraordinary conflict of interest that was concealed from voters.

Why King, but not Trump?

Texto completo: This week Republicans completed, with relative ease, what may be their least painful act of righting a wrong in 2019. They repudiated U.S. Rep. Steve King's repeated blathering about white supremacy.
The Iowan, in a New York Times interview, set things in motion by lamely wondering why terms such as "white nationalist," "white supremacist" and "Western civilization" have negative connotations.
From a prominent member of Congress, that's a dog whistle to organized haters such as the Proud Boys, neo-Nazis and their ilk. But it also appeals to a broader range of people who want cover for their own good, old-fashioned racial, ethnic and sectarian biases.
The GOP stripped King of his committee assignments, which is the political equivalent of ordering him to stand silent in a corner.
All good. But the righteousness of the 424-1 vote on the House resolution against the words of King on Tuesday (Jan. 15) is less convincing than it might seem. King has been serving up similar hateful talk for years. Only now have his party's leaders done something about it.
Have Republicans simply enumerated a "words you can't say" list for party members, like comedian George Carlin's famous seven banned words? Or do they accept that the prejudiced views behind King's statements are actually prevalent in their party? White supremacy, after all, dangerously plays into the president's America First doctrine.
Trump's foreign and domestic policy perspectives focus on the supposed victimhood of white Americans and the supposed dangers presented by others deemed to be of lesser status: African-Americans; Latinos, including asylum seekers at the southern border; Syrian refugees and Muslims generally.
Trump's willingness to cause devastating financial harm to federal workers with the shutdown is directly tied to his insistence on a pseudo-solution to the pseudo-problem of Central Americans acting out their supposed criminal blood-lust on Americans.
It's a story he tells and retells his supporters in almost pornographic detail, to keep them in a lather. But immigrants among us, documented or not, commit violent crime at much lower rates than native-born Americans. Trump ought to know that, having hired them at his enterprises throughout his career.
However, the Trump brand is xenophobia. He simply does not want the U.S. engaged in the world, except to dominate and despoil. His attitude is: make them pay or make them suffer. Or both.
What he and his supporters don't understand is that this attitude carries devastating risks.
Horrifyingly, the deaths of four Americans became an example on Wednesday. Two members of the U.S. military, a contract worker and a civilian, were murdered in a heinous act of terrorism in Syria that took as many as 19 lives total. ISIS immediately claimed credit.
The bombing deaths stood in direct conflict with Trump's December insistence that ISIS had been defeated, which he argued justifies withdrawing U.S. troops from a peace-seeking coalition with Kurdish-led forces in Syria.
Sen. Lindsey Graham was among the few Republicans who quickly spoke up, questioning whether Trump's bravado had goaded the terrorists to act. Graham also noted that in Iraq, the U.S. had also undermined the confidence of the people we claimed to be helping, with dire consequences.
Many military leaders today believe that withdrawing U.S. forces in Syria would create a vacuum for others with less benign intentions to fill. Would Turkey attack Kurdish forces as a new front in its decades-long war against ethnic Kurdish separatists? Would ISIS revive and flourish again? It's a fair bet that Trump neither knows nor cares.
Republicans were right to repudiate King. But it's Trump, not King, whose prejudices are causing the greatest harm at home and abroad. It's a shame the GOP lacks the backbone to stand up to him.

They sold people's cellphone location data to bounty hunters — these companies don't care about your privacy

Texto completo: The siren song of exchanging safety for privacy has long been sung by government. Now, private companies have learned to sing it too. Don't fall for it.

Earlier this month, the tech-focused publication Motherboard proved that cellphone location data was being sold to third-party companies —including bounty hunters. One of the companies that profited from the sale of sensitive and highly revealing location data was the data broker Zumigo. Now, new information shows that that company lobbied for even less protection of consumer data — ironically justifying less protections on arguments about security.

Other recent investigations on cellphone data have revealed the very real threats posed by inadequate privacy protections. The New York Times, for example, demonstrated that pings from a cellphone could, with a high degree of accuracy, track the daily movement of an individual — sometimes offering updates every minute or even every few seconds. That information could easily be traced to a single user based on where the phone was most nights. With the address in hand, public records reveal names and a treasure trove of information and, disturbingly, the ability to follow someone as they go about their days.

Aside from the truly creepy overtones of quiet eyes watching your moves from your own pocket, that lack of privacy for user data also has serious national security implications.

Cellphone location data, through a workout app that tracked users' runs, for example, revealed military bases, including CIA black sites. Additional research demonstrated how location data could be used to uncover Taiwanese missile sites by tracing individuals who rotate through different bases — especially when combined with other easily available information.

Clearly, data privacy has profound national and individual security concerns.

But, when Zumigo made its pitch to the Federal Communications Commission, as documented in a publicly available slide deck, it argued just the opposite: to protect safety, users should be pushed to waive their privacy rights.

Those slides, reported this week by Motherboard, are ingeniously deceptive. Arguing:
"We need the FCC’s help to make mobile real time account information more readily usable so that consumers can be protected from identity theft and account takeover."

In another slide they add:
"In their pursuit to protect consumer privacy by requiring burdensome/complex consent language to access mobile information, carriers are actually leaving consumers at risk, when they could actually be protecting them more."

Later, Zumigo tries to argue that privacy for safety is really what consumers want:
"We strongly believe that if consumer understood the vulnerabilities they face, and that if consumers understood the vulnerabilities they face, and their carrier’s ability to help prevent it, they would want the carrier data to be shared in order to keep them safe."

Although there are legitimate uses of willingly shared data and even large, aggregated data sets, consumers and the government shouldn't be duped by these suggestions the sharing and sale of deeply revealing information linked to individuals does not itself represent a profound privacy concern.

So far, the FCC doesn't seem to buy Zumigo's arguments. Indeed, as FCC Chairman Ajit Pai explained to Motherboard, “The FCC has no interest in removing consent requirements around the sharing of personal data."

Congress and consumers shouldn’t be swayed either. Companies that sell data to bounty hunters aren't interested in security even if that's what they told the government.

Texto completo: They say a picture is worth a thousand words. We'll have to make do with 600 or so.
The picture in question - the video, actually - electrified social media over the weekend. In it, a white high school boy wearing a "Make America Great Again" cap confronts an older Native American man who is beating a ceremonial drum and singing a Native song. The encounter took place Friday on the National Mall. The man was there as part of the Indigenous Peoples' March. The boy was with a group from Covington Catholic High School in Kentucky that was participating in the March For Life anti-abortion rally.
The man sings. The boy smirks. Some of his classmates mock the Native man. Someone yells, "Build the wall!" And there was, for many of us, something starkly symbolic in all of it, something that spoke of American fracture.
Yes, the story grew more complicated as details emerged over the weekend. It turns out the students had been drawn to the spot by a small group of black protesters - so-called "Black Hebrew Israelites" - using their First Amendment rights to curse and insult essentially everyone who was not them, including Catholics, whites, Native Americans and, at one point, a black person who disdained their toxic beliefs.
The students began what they described as a school spirit chant to drown out the black men. Tensions were high. And into this cauldron of ideology and identity stepped Nathan Phillips, a 64-year-old elder of the Omaha people and a Vietnam veteran. His aim in walking through the crowd, he said, was to settle things down. As he told The New York Times, "I stepped in between to pray."
The crowd, he said, parted to let him through. All except for the boy, since identified as Nick Sandmann, a junior. Phillips said the boy blocked him when he moved left. When he moved right, Sandmann did the same.
In a written statement released Sunday night, the boy denied blocking Phillips. "To be honest," he wrote, "I was startled and confused as to why he had approached me." But the boy in that video, smirking, trying not to laugh, is not startled or confused. He looks, rather, entitled and smug.
Indeed, what gave the image its initial, visceral power was the sense that Sandmann's expression was one we have seen before. It was on the face of an SS man as he cut off a rabbi's beard on a Warsaw street, on the face of an Alabama state trooper waiting at the Edmund Pettus Bridge. Heck, it was on the face of a hulking high school boy as he prepared to dunk a smaller kid's head into the toilet. It was the eternal expression of the bully at the head of a mob.
Now here it was on this boy, using his First Amendment right to wear a hat many of us consider the functional equivalent of a pointy white hood, as he faced down a child of the people who named the Mississippi River and left the first footprints in the virgin soil of the Blue Ridge Mountains. All while someone yelled about building a wall. And if the story has grown more complicated, what hasn't changed is the sense that those images capture a nation at the breaking point.
As it happens, this story unfolded over the weekend we set aside to honor Martin Luther King, the confrontation itself occurring near the spot where he said, "I have a dream." That, of course, was on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, a monument to the president who led this country through a war in which 2 percent of the population - the modern equivalent would be over 66 million people - died fighting over the meaning of freedom.
And Nathan Phillips' prayer? It was for unity, he said.

Texto completo: Tom Hanks' owes much to Santa Rosa native and two-time Oscar nominee Dan Striepeke.
Through 17 films, Hanks’ countenance was made camera-ready by Striepeke, the brother of late Sonoma County Sheriff Don Striepeke and one of Hollywood’s most acclaimed makeup artists.
Dan Striepeke, who got his start in theater at Santa Rosa High School in the late 1940s, died Saturday in Southern California of heart trouble at 88.
A second brother, Santa Rosa’s Ed Striepeke, recalls that Dan took his makeup kit with him when, not long after high school, he left Sonoma County for a trip to Mexico.
“On the way back,” Ed Striepeke said, “he went to Los Angeles and that’s where he stayed. At 19, he got his first job, on KTTV.”
Dan Striepeke went on to create makeup magic on scores of films: "Around the World in 80 Days," "The Sound of Music," "Spartacus," "Planet of the Apes," "The Magnificent Seven," "Viva Las Vegas," "Patton," and "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid."
He became head of the makeup department at Twentieth Century Fox, and then Tom Hanks’ exclusive makeup artist.
Hanks wrote in a 2006 New York Times piece, “The Man Who Aged Me,” that Striepeke was a true artist and friend who, in the making of "Forrest Gump," worked with him for 27 straight days and “took me from a teenager to a Vietnam soldier to parenthood as Sally Field died of cancer, earning him and his team one of Gump’s Academy Award nominations.
“Perhaps because few voters realized the makeup was there, he went home empty-handed.”

Texto completo: In November, a federal judge in San Francisco struck down President Trump’s attempt to limit asylum-seekers to legal points of entry. Trump complained about the action of “an Obama Judge.”
Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts criticized Trump, saying America does not have “Obama judges or Trump judges . . . What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.”
In December, a federal judge in Texas struck down the Affordable Care Act (“Obamacare”). The judge had been appointed by President George W. Bush. Sen. Christopher Murphy, D-Connecticut, said that “Republicans just blew up our health care system.” Press comments have portrayed the judge’s ruling as political and characterized the Fifth Circuit (comprised of Southern states), which will hear any appeal, that way as well.
Will Chief Justice Roberts be even-handed now and criticize those calling the federal court decision in Texas the act of Republicans? Perhaps he regrets having entered this forum in the first place. Roberts has challenged Trump in a sport at which Trump excels. When federal District Judge Derrick Watson in Hawaii ruled against the Trump travel ban (called the “Muslim ban” by its detractors), Trump was fulsome in criticizing the judge as political because President Obama had appointed him. Trump called the San Diego judge hearing the case against Trump University biased because the Indiana-born Judge’s parents were from Mexico — making at least two offensive leaps that a judge who was the son of Mexican immigrants would be prejudiced against Trump due to Trump’s comments on Mexicans, and that the prejudice would be so great it would affect the judge’s impartiality in a matter totally unrelated to Mexico or immigration.
Federal judges are called to make decisions based on the law, not their own policy preferences. President Trump and Senator Murphy have done much harm in blurring that distinction.
This is not to say federal judges are identical. Litigants choose courts to file suits where they have the best chance of winning. Trump noted the “Obama Judge” was in San Francisco, within the liberal-leaning 9th Circuit that often rules against him. After the Obamacare ruling, the New York Times observed that “conservative lawyers are known to choose [the federal court in Texas] to file cases.” Neither practice is improper, so long as the court decision itself is based on nonpolitical grounds.
When Trump opponents win at the trial court level, they then try to get the court to apply its ruling to the entire country. That’s what the federal judge in San Francisco did, blocking Trump’s asylum policy nationwide. The federal judge in Texas has not yet given national application to his order striking down Obamacare. If he does, expect Democratic politicians who praised the San Francisco judge’s nationwide order to be outraged by the Texas judge doing the same thing, and expect Trump to praise the judge’s wisdom.
The judiciary interprets laws; it has no power to make laws. Judges are fairly criticized when their legal interpretation seems to create new law that Congress or state legislatures never intended. But Murphy and Trump labeling judges based on which president appointed them goes far beyond fair criticism. This kind of attack, if repeated often enough, will eventually impede the vital function courts perform in our constitutional scheme. A calumny often repeated sometimes sticks. When the law compels a politically unpopular outcome in a case, Americans should hope the judge ignores the political and does what’s right. That’s especially important to those who care deeply about civil liberties. I doubt the Bill of Rights’ protections for criminals would be approved in a popular referendum today. Segregated schools were the result of popular majority votes. America loses something precious if the third branch, fearful of being labeled political, begins to act in a political way.

Melissa Martin: Intentional ending of a patient’s life more than ‘ medical error’?

Texto completo: The airwaves are buzzing with the story about an Ohio hospital and doctor and deceased patients.
Death by fentanyl? Incompetence or negligence? Intentional to reduce prolonged suffering? “Mercy killings?”
Physician-assisted death is not legal in Ohio. However, Ohio State Senator Charleta Tavares, D-Columbus, introduced SB 249, Ohio Aid in Dying Act, on Jan. 24, 2018, with co-sponsors Ohio State Senators Joseph Schiavoni and Kenny Yuko, both Democrats (D-25). If enacted, the Act will allow qualified terminally ill, dying Ohio residents to legally obtain medications to end their suffering at the end of life. On March 21, SB 249 was referred to Committee Health, Human Services and Medicaid.
“Mount Carmel recently reported to authorities the findings of an internal investigation that determined a Mount Carmel doctor who provided intensive care ordered significantly excessive and potentially fatal doses of pain medication for at least 27 patients who were near death. These patients’ families had requested that all life-saving measures be stopped, yet the amount of medicine the doctor ordered was more than what was needed to provide comfort,” according to information on the Mount Carmel website. www.mountcarmelhealth.com/about-us/facts/.
According a 2019 article in the Columbus Dispatch, “The Ohio Department of Health has begun an investigation into a Mount Carmel doctor accused of ordering potentially fatal doses of painkiller for 27 near-death hospital patients, all of whom have died. Mount Carmel officials fired the doctor and placed 20 pharmacists and nurses on leave while they look into the cases.”
“Eighteen months ago, Mount Carmel began work to stop preventable medical errors - work that puts systems into place to make the care we provide highly reliable and consistent,” is another statement on the Mount Carmel website.
Why is a policy to prevent medical errors not ongoing? Why 18 months ago? Why not prior to opening the hospital for business? It appears that whistle-blowing employees came forth with the allegations. When did the intentional ending of a patient’s life by a physician become ‘a medical error’?
Donald Harvey, a nurse’s aide, dubbed “the Angle of Death,” pleaded guilty in 1987 to killing 55 patients in Cincinnati and Kentucky hospitals. Many of his victims were chronically ill patients. He claimed he was ending their suffering. “Harvey told a newspaper after he pleaded guilty to avoid the death penalty that he liked the control of determining who lived and died. Former Hamilton County Prosecutor Arthur Ney Jr. who prosecuted the cases in Cincinnati said Harvey was not a mercy killer,” according to a 2017 article in USA Today.
Lisa Schattinger, a nurse, founded Ohio End of Life Options in 2015. The members support a Death with Dignity law in Ohio. “The law allows a mentally competent, terminally ill adult to obtain prescription medications from his or her doctors in order to hasten his or her imminent death.” This law exists in Oregon, Washington, Vermont, California, Colorado, Hawaii, and Washington D.C. www.ohiooptions.org.
Dr. Jack Kevorkian, a medical pathologist, was arrested, tried in a court of law, and convicted of physician-assisted suicide. According to a 2011 article in the New York Times, “The American Medical Association in 1995 called him “a reckless instrument of death” who “poses a great threat to the public.”
The phrase ‘physician-assisted suicide’ has been replaced by ‘death with dignity.’ Loaded language is a persuasive technique used to heighten emotion, gain support, and sway voters. And loaded phrases are changed to make horrific acts more palatable to the public.
Do you support or oppose a Death with Dignity law in Ohio for the terminally ill?
Do you support or oppose the alleged acts of a rogue physician to end the suffering of terminally ill patients by injecting lethal doses of fentanyl at Mount Carmel hospital in Columbus? Mercy killings or playing God?

For Democrats, women in 2020 may offer opportunity and hard choices

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Just over two decades ago, Barbara Lee, the Boston-based philanthropist and Democratic donor, distributed a ballot in national magazines featuring 20 women she believed were qualified to run for president.
Readers were asked to pick a favorite. The idea behind the project? To expose American voters to how many qualified women were out there, even at a time when they made up tiny fractions of the country's governors and members of Congress.
“When I first started this work, people all thought I was crazy," Lee recalled. “They would pat me on the hand and say, 'That's nice."'
The scenario Lee dreamed of is here: The 2020 ballot could be crowded with women. Four, maybe even five, top-tier women candidates are gearing up to compete against each other for the Democratic nomination.
Now the challenge will be: Whom should feminist donors like Lee and others support? At this point, many donors are taking a wait-and-see approach — and luxuriating in the abundance.
“Having multiple women on the debate stage will be a dream come true for me," said Lee, who founded the Barbara Lee Family Foundationto encourage more women to run for office. “There's never been a year like this."
With Senators Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, and Elizabeth Warren and US Representative Tulsi Gabbard taking the first steps to be in the race, and Senator Amy Klobuchar reportedly not far behind, the Democratic primary is shaping up to force some hard choices among those whose priority is to break what Hillary Clinton famously called the “highest, hardest glass ceiling."
And Donald Trump's victory over Clinton, despite widespread coverage of allegations of sexual assault and a tape of him bragging about grabbing women's genitals, has many in the Democratic Party gun shy about picking the wrong candidate. It could increase the appeal of a safer option, which might translate into “not a woman."
Women “absolutely" want to finally elect a female president, said Patti Solis Doyle, Clinton's campaign manager in 2008. “But they want to beat Trump more."
There's a reluctance among advocacy and funding groups to jump into the primary on behalf of any one candidate early on as many voters want to see which candidates sink or swim on his or her own. “They saw the failure of the [Clinton] coronation of 2016 and they want a fair fight this time," Solis Doyle added.
Faced with this situation, some donors are weighing a spread-the-wealth approach, at least in the early stages, giving their dollars to a number of the female candidates and seeing who gains traction. There are plenty of men running, too, of course, in a possible Democratic field that numbers up to 30 or more potential candidates.
“Electing a woman president is one of the most important causes of my life and I think we get there by uplifting as many women candidates as possible at this early stage," said Gretchen Sisson, a sociologist and donor in California, who plans to give to three to four women candidates in the primary. “At some point I have to decide who I'm voting for and that'll be a choice I make as a voter. That is a different calibration than the choices I make as a donor."
Lee said it's too soon to think about strategies for getting a woman over the finish line, saying now is the time to let the candidates “show you what they've got."
Ilyse Hogue, the president of the abortion rights group NARAL, echoed the idea of giving to multiple female candidates, saying many donors are embracing that strategy. Women candidates tend to raise less than their male competitors in early stages of campaigns, meaning early dollars to them can be a matter of life or death for their campaigns.
“Sitting out too long may be participating in erecting barriers that are harder for women to overcome," Hogue said.
NARAL and Emily's List, a powerful political group that backs progressive female candidates with early campaign money, have not decided whether they will pick a favorite among the Democratic field.
“As the primary continues we'll have to reevaluate, but right now we're just excited that some of our great candidates are deciding to throw their hat in the ring," said Christina Reynolds, vice president of communications for Emily's List.
Choosing among female candidates has led to controversy in the past. Stacey Evans complained to The New York Times when Emily's List passed her over to back Stacey Abrams in Georgia's gubernatorial primary race last year.
“If I were a donor, I would be very upset to know that my dollars were going to fight for one prochoice woman against another," Evans said.
Massachusetts Representative Katherine Clark, who helped recruit women candidates to run for Congress, said the issues Emily's List and other groups have in picking among talented women candidates is a “great problem to have," signifying the spike in women's willingness to run for office.
But if women-centric groups and donors stay on the sidelines, unable or unwilling to pick among popular female candidates, some fear a candidate such as Beto O'Rourke, the former Texas congressman, could swoop in and grab the momentum and donations.
“Pull up your big girl pants and pick somebody," urged Mary Anne Marsh, a Boston Democratic political consultant. “Do it early enough in the process to actually help a woman win."
Warren, Gillibrand, and Harris have all shown a formidable ability to raise funds, with Warren amassing the most money of any potential 2020 candidate in the Senate. But once the race begins in earnest, the small-donor money could be spread more thinly as more candidates announce.
And despite a risk averse feeling in the base after Clinton'sloss, women say they are fired up after propelling Democrats in races for the US House and several state houses in 2018. They made up 54 percent of voters in battleground districts and female candidates snagged a majority of the seats Democrats flipped, leading to the most female Congress in history. “Women won a lot of these key elections so I think a lot of us feel really energized," said Andrea Steele, the founder of Emerge America, which encourages women to seek office.
The effect of having several top-tier women candidates in the race could transform what it's like to run, Lee, and others hope, as the idea of a woman president finally becomes disentangled from Hillary Clinton, long the only plausible hope.
“In our focus groups for over 20 years, people say, I would vote for a woman just not that woman," she said. “And I do think that voters have been able to hide behind that bias."
Now, voters will have several women, all with very different backgrounds and leadership styles, to choose from. “I do think it's going to test that bias and I think it's going to break it down," she said.

This Year’s Profile in Courage Award Very Much Up for Grabs

Texto completo: For CQ-Roll Call

“Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.” Identifying the politician offering that idealistic advice is not so hard — President John F. Kennedy at his Jan. 20, 1961, inauguration. But that’s not all the 35th president had to say about the promise and challenges of America.
Climate change? “The supreme reality of our time is the vulnerability of our planet.” Income inequality? “If a free society cannot help the many who are poor, it cannot save the few who are rich.”
The John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum, based in Boston, planned to regularly tweet out Kennedy’s quotes, though if you now try to seek a daily dose of inspiration, you will see a note on its page: “We’re sorry, but we will not be posting updates to our social media channels during the government shutdown. Also, all National Archives facilities are closed and activities are canceled until further notice.”
Exactly.
Any president, or human being for that matter, is a combination of strengths and flaws. Kennedy’s belief in the value of public service — from volunteering to voting to running for elective office— stands out as something to be celebrated, especially though not exclusively in this time of political acrimony and gridlock.
Besides its primary mission to collect and make available for research the documents and memorabilia of the president, his family and contemporaries, the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation sees itself, in the words of Jacqueline Kennedy, as “a vital center of education and exchange and thought” and “a living center of study of the times in which he lived, which will inspire the ideals of democracy and freedom in young people all over the world.”
Its programs include a Profile in Courage essay contest, asking high school students to describe and analyze an act of political courage by a U.S. elected official who served during or after 1917, the year Kennedy was born. It also supports projects that promote civic education for young people in a country where, according to surveys, more people can name the Three Stooges than the three branches of government, said Steven M. Rothstein, executive director of the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation.
The library foundation casts a nonpartisan gaze on the qualities Kennedy believed in and those who exemplify them — the goal of the Profile in Courage award, named for Kennedy’s 1957 Pulitzer Prize-winning book detailing the choices made by senators despite knowing they could pay a political price.
“We want to celebrate the quality of political courage that President Kennedy admired,” said Rothstein, to recognize those who “stick to their convictions even when it may be difficult.”
Doubt has set in among Americans since Kennedy’s time, Rothstein said, citing Pew survey results showing that while in 1962, 75 percent trusted government, the figure fell to 17 percent a year ago. The Profile in Courage, created in 1989, recognizes officials on the local, state and federal level, from every party.
“We want to restore trust, and one of the ways is to have elected officials show the courage and stand up for what they believe, whether they’re on one side of the aisle or the other.”
In 2001, former President Gerald Ford, a Republican, won for pardoning former President Richard Nixon, knowing it probably would cost him politically. Ford wrote in his autobiography that he “wasn’t motivated primarily by sympathy for (Nixon’s) plight or by concern over the state of his health. It was the state of the country’s health at home and around the world that worried me.”
As Rothstein said, “You may or may not agree with the particular decision, but you recognize the courage” it took to make it.
Last year’s winner, former New Orleans mayor Mitch Landrieu, a Democrat, was recognized for the plan and execution, fiercely opposed by many, to remove the city’s Confederate monuments, and to passionately explain the history and pain behind their construction.
Think you know who deserves this year’s honor? Anyone can nominate someone who may fit the bill by Feb. 1. (Go to www.jfklibrary.org for more information.)
Washington may not be the first city that comes to mind when I think courage, not when it takes musings on “white supremacy” to finally make his Republican colleagues step away from Rep. Steve King of Iowa. He has been spouting similar racist insults and outrages through the years without losing support in his party. And words and actions from the party’s leader, Donald Trump, have matched King’s since the days before Trump was president, when he was sued for discriminating against African-Americans in the New York apartment buildings he and his father owned. Condemning him is a step too far for Republicans fearful of blowback from the base.
Yet I am encouraged that Tim Scott, the lone African-American Republican in the Senate, will occasionally call out examples of racism in his party, recently in a Washington Post opinion column, or vote against judicial nominees with questionable records on racial and social justice, knowing that many of his South Carolina constituents may not approve.
Former Democratic North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp almost certainly saw her tough re-election race slip out of reach with her “no” vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. Based, she said, on questions about his “temperament, honesty and impartiality” during his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, she cast it.
It’s fashionable to condemn government as the problem. But the current shutdown is teaching many Americans just how much we depend on government workers, many of whom choose to serve because they want to help their fellow citizens.
As lofty as Kennedy’s inaugural appeal to our better angels may have been, a different Kennedy quote resonates especially deeply in today’s political environment: “Let us not seek the Republican answer or the Democratic answer, but the right answer. Let us not seek to fix the blame for the past. Let us accept our own responsibility for the future.”

Texto completo: At this point in my career, I could go out with a grand, 21-gun salute, and climb into a rocket and the entire Supreme Court walks out and they jointly press a button, Im shot up into the air and theres an explosion and its orange and it spells, Good night and God love. In this culture? Two years later, its going to be, whos Conan? This is going to sound grim, but eventually, all our graves go unattended.

Baby Shark (Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo) is the YouTube sensation that has been viewed more than 2 billion times and made the Billboard Hot 100 chart for a second straight week.

Love or hate it, the South Korean company behind the 1 ½-minute song about a family of sharks is now seeking to capitalize on the success by expanding its kid-oriented entertainment business.

Seoul-based SmartStudy Co.s Pinkfong is planning to release short videos via Netflix, a cartoon series and a musical in North America this year, one of the companys founders said in an interview last week. The startup may also develop games that work with Amazons Alexa and Google Home voice assistants, he said.

The popularity of the sing-along builds on Koreas emergence as an entertainment powerhouse. Korean pop, or K-pop, has grown into a $5 billion industry thanks to the success of the likes of boy-band BTS, which has signed commercial deals with big companies from Hyundai to Mattel and Psy, whose Gangnam Style is at more than 3 billion views and counting.

Unlike BTS, SmartStudy has found its niche with kiddie pop, targeting children between 1 and 4 with addictive, dance-along videos. It was established in 2010 by three former online gaming employees. Seungkyu Lee, 44, who formerly worked at gamemaker Nexon Co.s marketing department, said the trio wanted to pursue opportunities in the growing market for educational content in smartphones by using their expertise in attracting and keeping users to make money.

For its next act, Lee says the company will be developing content for older children, 5 to 8, and that hes looking beyond sharks by closely examining penguins.

I really liked Madagascar, Lee said, in reference to the DreamWorks Animation films that featured some penguins.

Corporate brands have waded into fraught political territory during the first two years of the Trump presidency, clashing with the president and his allies on polarizing issues such as gun ownership and immigration. Companies are increasingly taking stances on social and political issues important to their employees, customers and the broader public. With the standoff over the federal government shutdown, this more emboldened public posture by companies is again on display.

As the longest government shutdown in U.S. history extends, 800,000 federal workers are left without paychecks, affecting the work of dozens of federal agencies. Companies are stepping into the fray through advocacy, charity and potent Twitter trolling.

Several outdoor apparel brands, including REI, Columbia Sportswear and the North Face, have used their social media accounts in recent days to support national parks, whose service has been disrupted by the shutdown.

Make Americas parks open again, said Columbia Sportswear chief executive Tim Boyle, in a Twitter post, riffing on Trumps campaign slogan. He then took aim at the proposed wall that Trump wants built on the U.S.-Mexico border, the signature issue at the heart of the shutdown dispute. Walls shouldnt block access to parks, and federal workers shouldnt be left out in the cold. Work together to open our parks, Boyle wrote.

Food industry megabrand Kraft said it was opening a store in Washington to offer free food to federal workers. We know feeding a family can be stressful. And while we cant do anything about the whole paycheck thing, well do what we can to see that family dinners remain business as usual, the company said in a Facebook events page. Kraft will offer its macaroni and cheese, salad dressing, cheese, mayo and barbecue sauce. The company said it wont charge the workers any money, and instead asks them to donate to their favorite charity once their work lives return to normal.

Daisy Duck Bandits long, strange trip is finally over.

The 2-year-old tabby cat went missing from his home in Michigan just before Halloween. Almost two months later, Bandit was found wandering the streets of Tampa, more than 1,100 miles away.

Our cat Daisy went missing shortly before Halloween. I checked the shelters and made some local postings, but our cat, Daisy/Bandit, ended up in Tampa, Florida, wrote the cats owner, Judy Sanborn, in a GoFundMe campaign to bring him home. We dont know if he hitched a ride in a moving van or a snowbird took him down to Florida.

BluePearl Veterinary Partners spokesman Curtis Krueger said a good Samaritan brought Bandit to its Tampa veterinary hospital in mid-December. She was out walking her dog when Bandit spotted them and followed them home. The woman called BluePearl and brought the cat in.

There, the veterinary staff discovered Bandits microchip, which allowed them to track down the cats owner. The Michigan area code didnt throw them off too much, Krueger said, since in Florida everyones got a cellphone from some place.

They called the Sanborns and told them where to pick Bandit up. Confused at the unfamiliar street names, they asked where the hospital was.

The answer: Tampa.

But how did the cat get there from Michigan? Thats the mystery.

It took almost a month to figure out the logistics of getting Bandit back home. The Sanborns raised $575 in a GoFundMe to bring their cat back to Dearborn, Mich., but couldnt find a relative or friend traveling to Florida who could do it. BluePearl was able to connect the Sanborns with Stephanie Nay of Tampas Bamboo Pet Sitting. Then Nay eventually secured a flight for Bandit with her friend, Dossie Marrone. He caught a flight home on Jan. 10.

Today, my job is to get you into Sudoku jazz. What is Sudoku jazz, you ask? Sudoku jazz is something I just made up.

It isnt a style of playing, its a style of listening  and it entered my life in mid-November after I bought a copy of Lebroba, a new album by the great jazz drummer Andrew Cyrille. Made with some help from guitarist Bill Frisell and trumpeter Wadada Leo Smith, its a recording of largely improvised, occasionally unmetered tunes, played elegantly and unpredictably. Ive listened to it nearly every day for the past two months.

That means it must be amazing, huh? Yes and no. Yes, Lebroba is amazing in that it refuses to let me grow tired of it, but no, it isnt amazing in the sweeping, startling, bravura-stroked ways that usually shout amazing! Instead, this music feels minimal and manageable, but still a little mysterious  not unlike the Sudoku puzzle.

I know what to expect from Lebroba (drums, guitar, trumpet), just as I know what to expect from a Sudoku (digits on a grid), but I have no idea how my experience with either will unfold. Not exactly. Thats Sudoku jazz. Its a ritual listening experience that feels unsurprising and unpredictable.

And for anyone who still finds jazz to be impenetrable, forbidding or worse, maybe this is a good way in. In his 2016 book, A Listeners Guide to Free Improvisation, the music writer John Corbett helpfully reminds us that improvised music is not a mystery cult, esoteric language, or secret handshake. It needs no decoder ring. Nor does improvised jazz need to blow our squishy little minds every time we encounter it. Epiphanies can be tiny, tidy things. Sometimes, the big ones gather slowly, in flecks.

Just as splashing around in the dishwater can feel both shallow and deep, I think Sudoku jazz can feel both small and vast. Its a way of getting into improvised music, but more so, its a way of staying in  a little ritual that might better prepare us for the big unknown, or at least help us get from today to tomorrow.

Texto completo: Our topic for today: three stories and a letter.
The stories all made recent headlines. The first was about the state of Florida posthumously pardoning the Groveland Four, a group of African-American men who suffered torture, prison and murder after being falsely accused of raping a white woman in 1949.
The second concerns broad Republican condemnation of one of their own, Rep. Steve King, for an interview with The New York Times in which he questioned why the terms "white nationalist" and "white supremacist" should be considered offensive.
The third involves a directive - since rescinded - NBC News sent its writers, reporters and anchors about King's words. "Be careful to avoid characterizing (King's) remarks as racist," it said, suggesting that the remarks instead be described as 'what many are calling racist.' "
As for the letter: It was written by Martin Luther King Jr., whose 90th birthday the nation commemorates Monday. King famously penned the epistle from a jail cell in Birmingham in response to a group of white clergymen, eight moderate, principled men, who had condemned as "unwise and untimely" his demonstrations against segregation in their city.
One passage of King's response seems especially apropos to this moment. In it, he confessed that he had become "gravely disappointed with the white moderate." Too often, he said, they were "more devoted to 'order' than to justice" and preferred "a negative peace, which is the absence of tension to a positive peace, which is the presence of justice."
Added King: "Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will."
Make no mistake: King well knew that all over the South, liberal white kids were risking their lives for black freedom. He was calling out other white people, often older, more moderate white people like those eight men, for the tepidness and flaccidity of their commitment to racial reconciliation. This was 1963, but as the stories above suggest, that problem endures.
It is possible, for instance, to celebrate that Florida has finally done right by the Groveland Four - and yet, to also be disgusted that it takes 70 years for the state to belatedly admit its crimes and deliver some small measure of delayed "justice."
It is possible to consider the GOP's condemnation of Steve King all well and fine, yet also a little arbitrary and affected given that King has a history of racist rhetoric that passed without his party seeming to much notice or care - and that the GOP itself has a long record of thinly veiled racism as obvious as the writing on Barack Obama's birth certificate.
It is possible to concede that NBC has an interest in ensuring its people remain disinterested observers of events they report, yet feel that in asking them to refrain from calling obvious racism obvious racism, the network doesn't embody journalistic rigor so much as it does white peoples' too frequent refusal to call out such racism even when it's right in front of them.
We may safely assume most NBC executives, Republican lawmakers and Florida officials would say - and probably believe - all the right things if you asked about their commitment to racial justice. Yet given a chance to put force behind that commitment, they failed. In Florida's case, they failed for seven decades.
"The ultimate tragedy," King once said, "is not the oppression and cruelty by the bad people but the silence over that by the good people." He was right.
If you are good, yet silent, maybe you're not really as good as you think.

Texto completo: CHICAGO - Tribune Publishing CEO Justin Dearborn has stepped down after nearly three years at the helm, the Chicago-based newspaper company announced Thursday.
Longtime Chicago newspaper executive Tim Knight was named CEO, effective immediately. Knight, who had served as president of the company, will also join the Tribune Publishing board.
Board member David Dreier, a former congressman, has been named chairman of Tribune Publishing, replacing Dearborn.
The company also announced the departures Thursday of Ross Levinsohn and Mickie Rosen, who served as CEO and president, respectively, of Tribune Interactive, the digital arm of Tribune Publishing.
The moves come as Tribune Publishing is engaged in a formal sale process. In December, the company terminated negotiations to sell the newspaper chain to the California-based McClatchy Co. New York-based investment firm Donerail and Dallas-based newspaper group Aim Media are working on a joint bid to buy Tribune Publishing, according to multiple sources familiar with negotiations. Tribune Publishing is the parent company of the Chicago Tribune.
Tribune Publishing also owns the Baltimore Sun; Hartford Courant; Orlando Sentinel; the New York Daily News; the Capital Gazette in Annapolis, Md.; The Morning Call in Allentown, Pa.; the Daily Press in Newport News, Va.; and The Virginian-Pilot in Norfolk, Va. The company reverted to its legacy name in October.
Dearborn, 49, joined Tribune Publishing as CEO in February 2016, three weeks after his longtime business associate, Michael Ferro, became the company's largest shareholder and non-executive chairman. Ferro stepped down from the board last year.
Knight, 53, previously served as CEO of Wrapports, the former ownership group of the Chicago Sun-Times.
Levinsohn, 55, joined Tribune Publishing in 2017 as publisher and CEO of the Los Angeles Times, which was then owned by the Chicago-based company.

OUR CITY'S BETTER THAN YOURS, AND HERE'S THE PROOF BEING RANKED 'BEST OF' AND 'COOLEST' IS GOOD FOR BUSINESS, GOOD FOR THE SPIRIT

Texto completo: It's only natural that Pittsburghers and expatriates love to see their affection for their hometown mirrored in the way the rest of the world sees us.
And the way they see us, judging by the number of lists we make, is: They like us! They really like us!
Nary a day goes by when Pittsburgh or a nearby town isn't the "best of" the "coolest" or among the leads in a top (name your number) list.
It was just on Jan. 14 that Realtor.com's "7 Safest, Most Affordable Cities in America" put Pittsburgh at No. 2, behind Grand Rapids, Mich. An analysis of the 150 largest metro areas with home prices below the $300,000 national median had Pittsburgh at $173,000, and the number of violent crimes here fell 24.8 percent from 2000 to 2014, according to the most recent FBI data.
"When homeowners think about the biggest investment of their life, top of mind is how safe an area would be to live in and raise a family," Rick Palacios Jr., director of research at John Burns Real Estate Consulting, told Realtors.com.
There's even a silver lining when the news isn't good. For example, in a 2015 list of American cities with the dreariest weather, we share the No. 3 position with Portland, Ore., and still have bragging rights over 1-2 Seattle and Buffalo.
In November, VisitPittsburgh made the case for Pittsburgh as a beacon of livability before 4,000 members of the Professional Convention Management Association by leading with - what else? - a list.
On Dec. 4 of last year, National Geographic Traveller's "The Cool List of 2019" placed Pittsburgh No. 3 in the world, behind Setouchi, Japan, and Antarctica, and just ahead of the Mediterranean island of Corsica and Cambodia.
The site said that Pittsburgh is still a blue-collar town at heart but has revealed "its refined side" and is more "elegant than many visitors might expect." As evidence, it listed the Heinz History Center's exhibition on the Apollo 11 moon landing, the Carnegie International and, as always, The Andy Warhol Museum. The "Don't Miss" on this list: "The giant Gothic Cathedral of Learning, which contains gloriously kitsch nationality themed rooms."
It also referred to new British Airways direct flights from Pittsburgh to London's Heathrow Airport, which the airline touts on its website as "the first airline to connect London to Pennsylvania's coolest city. Be one of the first to find out how this former steel city has gone from Rust Belt giant to full-pelt hipster heaven."
"Coolest" and "hipster," you say? They must have been reading the 2018 lists that include Pittsburgh in those categories.
Craig Davis is president and CEO of VisitPittsburgh, whose purpose is to attract tourists, businesses and conventioneers to the Pittsburgh area.
A list from a recognizable, credible source such as National Geographic was a natural when speaking before an audience representing nearly 2,000 conventions, with the potential to bring theirs to Pittsburgh.
"For us, it's a focus of our marketing," he said of the "best of," "coolest" and other positive lists. Of course VisitPittsburgh has great things to say about the region, but kudos from an unsolicited and credible third party make people stand up and notice.
"If you are going to send your child to school here, move here or start a business here, that sends a very, very powerful message," Mr. Davis said.
Asked about these lists and their impact on the city and his role, Mayor Bill Peduto said via email, "After years of managing decline - and bad headlines - Pittsburgh lately has had to learn to manage growth and success. Being on all these lists is part of that. My challenge as mayor is to make sure all Pittsburghers are part of that growth, and that these national and international list-makers recognize that."
Not all such lists are subjective. It's a win for Pittsburgh pride when we win the numbers game. For example, the top-selling NHL jersey is Sidney Crosby's No. 87.
And when towns big and small in Western Pennsylvania make a top 10 list for anything positive, we puff out our chests just that much more. If it's something we personally contribute to, well, there are a lot of craft beer makers feeling pretty good about 2018.
In truth, not all list-makers do their homework: Should a ranking of Lawrenceville as a top hipster neighborhood have a photo only of the Golden Triangle? Will we ever be allowed to move beyond comparisons to the smoky steel city days of yesteryear? And then there are the lists spurred by sponsorships and agendas - should we get all pumped up about those?
The New York Times, in 2017, ran a story with the headline: "Built on Steel, Pittsburgh Now Thrives on Culture." It was North Side-centric, with lots about Andy Warhol and the museum that bears his name, and Randyland, the eclectic, beyond-description public art house and garden in the Mexican War Streets. It did not mention the other Carnegie Museums or a single resident of the Pittsburgh Cultural District. . But I digress.
A recent list, released just this month by Insider.com ("our mission is to inform and inspire"), ranked the best small towns - one in each state. In Pennsylvania, that town is really, really small. According to Insider.com, Volant, Lawrence County, population 157, is tops in PA for quaintness and charm, thanks largely to its Amish residents.
Insider's criteria was "small towns with a plethora of activities for both locals and visitors. While some of the towns and villages are bustling tourist destinations, others are quiet suburban communities that are home to only a select few."
Only fellow small towns Kimmswick, Mo., population 152, and Stockholm, Wis., at 64, are smaller than Volant, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The largest small towns on the list had populations of more than 13,000.
Insider determined: "About an hour and a half north of Pittsburgh, you'll find a charming town named Volant. Although the town is home to mostly the Amish, it's a perfect place to visit and experience the Amish lifestyle and quaint community. As you tour, horse-drawn carriages will prance past, while each shop you enter will be stocked with Amish goods such as fabrics, spices and jams. You can even get tours of Amish schoolhouses and farms. If that isn't enough to pique your interest, the town also hosts a Harry Potter festival every summer."
That festival, held close to Harry's July 31 birthday, is called the WANDerful Wizarding Weekend and is very much a small-town fair with an HP theme. And Insider didn't mention the quaint stuff nearby, including Banks Covered Bridge in New Wilmington. And, if you find yourself craving a change of pace, Volant is a 10-minute drive from the Grove City Outlets.
The point is, we can offer as Exhibit A the many, many lists that say we are residents of a city that is one of America's most livable. And because we enjoy these lists as much as you do, we are going to start keeping track of the best of the best lists about the things that make Pittsburgh one of the world's most livable city, with links to stories that help put these lists and list-makers in perspective.

Texto completo: Just before Christmas, a story broke that seemed too strange — and too hypocritical — to be true. As Democratic Party elders were trying to stifle loutish impeachment threats by fanatical House freshmen, it was revealed that Democratic operatives had used cyber fraud to manipulate the 2017 Alabama Senate race.
It’s hard to know precisely who masterminded the plot because the perpetrators have lawyered up and are pointing fingers at one another. But according to the New York Times and subsequent reporting in The Washington Post, the culprits in the self-styled “Project Birmingham” used the same tactics employed by Russian disinformation specialists that lie at the heart of the 2016 U.S. presidential election controversy.
Those tactics included a phony Facebook page, “Alabama Conservative Politics,” intended to divert votes from GOP nominee Roy Moore to a Republican write-in candidate. It entailed a “false flag” effort suggesting that automated Russian bots were supporting Moore on Twitter. The tactics worked. Seven weeks before the election, the Montgomery Advertiser published a piece headlined “Russian invasion? Roy Moore sees spike in Twitter followers from land of Putin.” Other news outlets followed suit, further tarnishing a candidate reeling under sexual misconduct allegations.
Did this effort cost Moore the election, which he narrowly lost to Doug Jones? Did dirty tricks deprive Republicans of a supposedly safe seat at a time when control the U.S. Senate was up for grabs? Some observers are skeptical. “Roy Moore is so well known in Alabama that people had very settled opinions about whether they wanted him as their senator before the race even started,” University of Alabama political scientist Joseph L. Smith told reporters.
That sounds right, but the same could be said of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Even Democrats who claim the 2016 election was stolen from them would concede that almost everyone had “settled opinions” about these two nominees before Russian troll farms began spewing their garbage during the 2016 general election. But the truly stunning hypocrisy is that Project Birmingham, which included a former Google engineer who worked on the 2012 Obama presidential campaign and for the Obama administration, faithfully emulated the tactics of the Russian troll farms dubbed “Fancy Bear” and “Cozy Bear,” which are under the auspices of Russia’s intelligence services and military.
In other words, Democrats who played games in Alabama did more than erode their party’s moral high ground. In consciously mimicking the enemy, they also put the spotlight on special prosecutor Robert Mueller and his investigation.
Last February, a grand jury impaneled to hear Mueller’s evidence indicted 13 Russians and three Russian companies for their 2016 activities. The special prosecutor followed this up with July indictments of 12 Russian military officers for hacking, a serious crime. But it’s the February 2018 indictments that are more problematic for Democrats.
Those 13 Russian trolls were indicted on conspiracy charges. But what laws did they conspire to break? Federal election statutes prohibiting campaign contributions, maybe? Abusing their travel visas, perhaps, as none of the Russians who visited the U.S. told U.S. Customs what they were up to? Those are misdemeanors, and it’s not what the government charged them with anyway. They were indicted for conspiring “to defraud the United States.”
It’s not a crime to post political comments under an online alias. It’s not a criminal offense in this country to spew inaccurate information on social media — or tell outright lies about candidates for public office If it were, the U.S. would need a hundred more prisons, at least one of them for politicians and campaign consultants.
Mueller’s theory of the case became clear on June 15, when Deputy Solicitor General Michael Dreeben argued in court against a motion by Concord, one of the indicted Russian corporations, to dismiss the charges. The special counsel, Concord argued, targeted it “for a contrived crime not specifically defined in any statute, without notice and under a standard known only to the special counsel.”
“We do not need to prove a criminal violation of the underlying statute,” Dreeben told U.S. District Court Judge Dabney Friedrich in response.
If you find that standard alarmingly elastic, you’re not alone. “The federal government does lots of things, more and more every year, and many things private parties do can get in the government’s way,” former Justice Department lawyer Jack Townsend told Weekly Standard writer Eric Felten, one of the few journalists who explored the implications of Muller’s indictment. “It can’t be that each such action is automatically a felony.”
Yet, Dreeben was speaking the truth. “Conspiracy to defraud,” known as a “Klein conspiracy,” comes from a complex 1950s tax case in which the defendants and their accountants went to extraordinary lengths to hide income – they opened no fewer than 17 offshore companies, among other strategies – consistently thwarting the Internal Revenue Service until federal prosecutors secured a conviction on a single conspiracy count. As legal scholars Ben Wittes and Emma Kohse point out, the doctrine is even older than that. It comes from a 1910 Supreme Court ruling that USDA officials who falsified crop reports could be convicted of conspiracy “for impairing, obstructing, or defeating the lawful function of any department of government.”
Fourteen years later, in a decision written by Chief Justice William Howard Taft, the high court went further, ruling that conspiring to defraud the United States “also means to interfere with or obstruct one of its lawful governmental functions by deceit, craft or trickery, or at least by means that are dishonest.”
Such language gives Bob Mueller a lot of leeway. How did the Russians “defraud” the United States? Not merely by technical violations of campaign finance laws, but by running a big con on the American people — impersonating Americans and pitting us against each other. In one instance, Russian trolls pretending to be both anti-Islam and pro-Islam were told to demonstrate at the same Houston location at the same time, apparently in hopes of fomenting violence.
This certainly seems a fraud on the United States. But what are we to make of the real American, a registered Democrat, no less, who posted stories in 2016 from the “Denver Guardian,” with extravagant slanders against Hillary Clinton: She pocketed millions of dollars from the Afghanistan War; an FBI agent investigating her emails was found dead – that kind of thing. Vicious stuff, all of it invented. (There is no Denver Guardian, for starters.) The perpetrator apparently did it for money. Should he be prosecuted for conspiring to defraud the country? If so, then what about the utterly specious 2012 ads run by the Obama campaign blaming Mitt Romney for the death of a steelworker’s wife?
That was a form of fraud. It was most definitely a conspiracy – mapped out by Obama’s top campaign aides. I’m not saying federal prosecutors should start parsing campaign rhetoric looking for criminal intent. That would be insane, not to mention unconstitutional. Nor do the Democratic Party computer nerds who fooled around in the Alabama sandbox want any attention from the special prosecutor. But here’s Mueller’s dilemma: If he indicts Russians who targeted Democrats while giving a pass to Americans who used the exact same fraudulent means to harm Republicans, then his investigation no longer looks like it’s about the sanctity of the U.S. election process. It looks like it’s about getting Donald Trump.

Texto completo: Depending on who you talk to, dieting is life-changing, terrible for you, optimistic, misguided, will keep you alive or put you in an early grave. Then there's all that lingo that comes with mastering the biological theories behind dieting, like ketosis and alkaline and lectin — phrases that make you feel like you're in a science class rather than just trying to shed a few pounds or live a healthier life. Have no fear, because we've got a simplified guide for you about the trendiest diets going into the new year — that self-conscious time when everyone's re-evaluating their lifestyle. With each diet description is a rating of its effectiveness, done by U.S. News and World Report in August. We've included their findings, based on input from a panel of health experts, on weight loss and healthiness for each diet. While doing this study they took into account the diet being "relatively easy to follow, nutritious, safe, effective for weight loss and protective against diabetes and heart disease." Without further ado, here are the diet trends you're likely to see referenced in celebrity Instagram captions in 2019:
Ketogenic Perhaps the biggest fad that's riding its wave of popularity right into 2019 is the Ketogenic, or "Keto," diet. Celebs like Kourtney Kardashian, Al Roker and Vinny Guadagnino (who affectionately went by the nickname "Keto Guido" on the new seasons of "Jersey Shore") have popularized the diet.
Ketogenic diets are low on carbs and high on fat, which puts the body in a state of ketosis. Ketosis is a metabolic state that happens when your body doesn't have enough carbohydrates for your cells to burn for energy. So instead, it burns fat.
The Keto diet is very effective at slimming your waistline, but does cause huge changes to your body that are not always positive. U.S. News & World Report says that changing the way your body is fueled from carbs to fat can lead to leg cramps, dehydration, brain fog, dizziness and more.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.8/5 Weight Loss | 1.6/5 Healthy
Paleo The philosophy of this diet is in the name. The Paleo diet encourages people to eat foods that would have been available to our Paleolithic ancestors. In case you need to brush up on your high school science, the Paleolithic era started 2.5 million years ago.
Basically, with this diet you're looking at meals that could either be hunted or gathered — lean meats, fish, vegetables, nuts and seeds. And, because farming hadn't been developed yet in the Paleolithic era, Paleo dieters are expected to cut out foods that became popularized through farming like dairy products, legumes and grains, as well. Those who follow the Paleo diet believe that modern eating habits don't suit our prehistoric genetic makeup, so we should return to Stone Age-approved meals.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.5/5 Weight Loss | 2.5/5 Healthy
Alkaline Diet Acid is the enemy of the Alkaline diet. The thought behind this diet is to cut out foods that cause your body to produce acid – including meat, wheat, refined sugar, processed foods, dairy, eggs, canned food, packaged snacks, caffeine and alcohol. You may be thinking: what else is there to eat?
The Alkaline diet approves of most fruits and vegetables, nuts, legumes, soybeans and tofu. These are foods that are alkaline — in other words have a pH value of 7, which is neutral, or above. Foods with a pH value below 7 are acidic, and therefore a no-go.
That said, there is no solid science to support that regulating the pH values of your food will change the overall pH balance of your body. It will do that naturally.
However, in general, eating a lot of fruits and veggies and avoiding processed foods will make you lose weight.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.1/5 Weight Loss | 2.9/5 Healthy
Whole30 A popular diet that spurred a New York Times bestselling book, Whole30 encourages people to eat foods with as few ingredients as possible, and all those ingredients should be substances you know and can pronounce. A head of broccoli? Go for it. A piece of candy made with things like glycerin, citric acid, potassium sorbate, red 40 and soy lecithin? Not so much.
The program's website claims that if you completely avoid foods such as alcohol, anything with added sugar, legumes, dairy and more, for 30 days, you will "eliminate cravings, restore a healthy metabolism, heal the digestive tract, reduce systemic inflammation, and discover how these foods are truly impacting how you look, how you feel, and your quality of life." This program also advocates not stepping on a scale, to make the diet more about health than weight loss.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.3/5 on Weight Loss | 2.4/5 on Healthy
Mediterranean The Mediterranean diet advocates heart-healthy foods that are typically eaten in the Mediterranean. The diet guides people to eat plenty of plants and foods that are low on "bad" cholesterol, such as legumes, nuts, wheat, fruits and veggies. For example, in this diet, you replace butter with healthy fats like olive oil, salt with herbs and spices, and red meat with fish and poultry.
Plus, it totally encourages a glass of red wine every now and then. In essence, you're not avoiding fats and carbs, you're just choosing the healthier versions.
U.S. News & World Report: 3.0/5 on Weight loss | 4.8/5 on Healthy
Flexitarian Think of the Flexitarian diet as vegetarian with a lot of cheat days. The term applies to people who typically eat meatless but occasionally incorporate meat or fish into their diet. New York Times columnist Mark Bittman (who also wrote "VB6: Eat Vegan Before 6:00") has a big role in popularizing this diet. Bittman, as his book title suggests, advocates eating vegan before 6 p.m.
An easier way to ease into this diet is by doing a few meatless days a week, says Dawn Jackson Blatner, the author of "The Flexitarian Diet" and a registered dietitian, until you reach the top tier, which is five meatless days a week.
U.S. News & World Report: 3.3/5 on Weight loss | 4.6/5 on Healthy
Lectin-free We can trace the popularity of this diet back to Kelly Clarkson's praise of "The Plant Paradox Cookbook" by Dr. Steve Gundry.
She said this book helped her achieve her recent weight loss. Gundry has a long, science-fiction-esque explanation about why plants high in lectins (a kind of protein) like beans, legumes and whole grains are bad for you. An extraordinarily simplified version of his theory is that lectins in the plants cause confusion in the immune system and inflammation.
An extraordinarily dramatized version of his theory is that plants are waging war against us so we don't eat them and we're too dumb to adjust our diets. It's true lectins can be toxic in some cases, but much of Gundry's research is based on inconsistent evidence.

Texto completo: "We certainly hope this (shutdown) doesn't continue and they come to some resolution so they're no longer holding back our dollars for something so frivolous."
Douglas Cox, chairman of the Menominee Indian Tribe
GREEN BAY - The children had just awakened from a nap and were still rubbing sleep from their eyes when they pulled up tiny chairs at two small U-shaped tables.
Bowing their heads to say grace in their Oneida native language, the Head Start students were about to snack on Kiwi slices and rice cakes washed down with cups of water.
The Oneida Nation spends $233,000 annually on its Head Start program, which oversees 152 children at two locations on the reservation. Almost three-fourths of Head Start funding for the Green Bay-area tribe is paid through federal funds — roughly $172,000.
But all federal funds flowing to the Oneida and other Wisconsin tribes, as well as Indian tribes across the country, have dried up since the federal government shutdown.
Wisconsin tribes are using their own funds to continue to provide education, health, law enforcement, food pantries and other services, but if the shutdown lasts much longer — and there's no sign of the impasse ending any time soon — some services could be curtailed or cut, hiring might be frozen, workers could be laid off and other drastic measures taken.
"We're fortunate we have the infrastructure and manpower here. A lot of tribes don't have that," Oneida Vice Chairman Brandon Yellowbird Stevens said. "We can supplant the loss of funds with emergency contingency funding."
But the tribe's emergency funding is not limitless and it's designed for emergencies, and no one knows how long the federal shutdown, already the longest, will last.
The Bureau of Indian Affairs has furloughed 2,295 of its 4,057 employees, the New York Times reported.
When Oneida self-government coordinator Candice Skenandore tries to contact someone at the bureau, which she does daily for her job, she gets automatic email replies that the person she's trying to reach is on furlough for an indefinite time. It's the same for voicemail.
Skenandore is in the middle of negotiations for a new funding agreement for the tribe's health services and she's waiting for grant approvals and funding OKs for several programs. But everything is on hold and Skenandore knows it will take several weeks, if not months, for federal employees to get up to speed once the shutdown ends.
Skenandore is supposed to attend a tribal self-governance advisory board meeting in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 21, but she's not sure if the meeting will be held.
The shutdown "is stopping us from doing what we need to do to improve our health services," said Skenandore, whose position is federally funded. The tribe is paying her salary during the shutdown.
About 1.9 million American Indians and Alaska Natives receive basic services from the Department of Interior's Bureau of Indian Affairs. Some tribes, like the Oneida, administer services funded by BIA money, while other tribes have their programs run by federal workers, many of whom are tribal members.
Services tied to decades-old treaties Because of treaties negotiated decades ago, the money funneled to tribes for health care, education, law enforcement and other services is in exchange for tribal nations giving up millions of acres of land in the 1800s. In effect, the tribes prepaid with land for funds now held up by the shutdown.
There's no guarantee tribes will ever see that money. Stevens said the Oneida tribe never got the money it was owed and was not paid during the government shutdown of 2013.
"We ceded millions of acres of land and, in return, the United States said they would pay for health and education," Stevens said.
The Oneida tribe was based in New York at the time and gave up 3 million acres. It later moved to Wisconsin.
Stevens points out that the Oneida were among America's first allies, fighting alongside American troops and helping feed George Washington's army when it was hunkered down at Valley Forge during the brutal winter of 1777. The tribe continues to receive a symbolic annuity payment of $1,800 each year from the Treasury Department as part of a treaty signed at the end of the Revolutionary War.
The tribe operates a 48-bed nursing home and a health center that handles 350,000 patient visits annually, offering family practice, internal medicine, behavioral health, dental, optical and public health services among other things. Its pharmacy dispenses between 1,000 and 1,200 prescriptions daily, said Debbie Danforth, comprehensive health director for operations.
Last week Danforth was on a conference call with other tribal health directors and learned that while some tribes are able to continue to provide services during the shutdown like the Oneida, some might have to close their clinics in a few weeks.
'It's truly scary' "It's truly scary for some tribes," Danforth said.
Of the Oneida Nation's roughly $490 million 2019 fiscal year budget, about $50 million comes from federal grants and self-governance funds. There are 17,165 enrolled members in the Oneida tribe with more than 4,400 living on the reservation, including 1,000 who are 55 or older.
"Our message to Congress: these should not be discretionary, we shouldn't be the first to be cut," Stevens said.
Wisconsin's other tribes are facing the same difficulties as the Oneida.
The Stockbridge-Munsee tribe is the largest employer in Shawano County with about 900 employees. The tribe does not have its own school system but provides tutors and a public safety officer for school districts where tribal members attend, in Gresham and Bowler. It handles snowplowing and repairing roads for many smaller communities in Shawano County.
About 1,475 people are enrolled in the Stockbridge-Munsee tribe with 500 living on the reservation.
"But many of those are aging so their health care needs are great," Stockbridge-Munsee President Shannon Holsey said.
"A majority of our citizens are no longer in the workforce. They're living on fixed incomes and they look to the tribal nations for needs such as transportation to medical appointments and healthy food distribution through Meals on Wheels," Holsey said.
The biggest priority for the Stockbridge-Munsee tribe is its rural health clinic in Bowler, which offers general medicine, dental, behavioral health, chiropractic and community health services as well as a pharmacy. Since there are no buses or public transportation, the tribe shuttles members who cannot get to a doctor on their own and sends a registered nurse to help people who forget to take their medicine.
The tribe is paying for services normally provided by federal funds out of its reserves but Holsey said there's a limit to that, especially for a small tribe like the Stockbridge-Munsee.
Lac du Flambeau tightens spending Two weeks into the shutdown, the Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa decided to freeze all capital expenditures until further notice and told employees to be frugal in spending. Not all federal grants have been affected by the shutdown but some have and tribal administrators are meeting regularly with the tribe's accounting staff.
"We want to avoid disruption in services wherever possible and we are working carefully to determine the impact to our general fund and to avoid layoffs," Lac du Flambeau President Joseph Wildcat Sr. said in a statement.
The Menominee Indian Tribe is also using reserve funds to keep essential programs open, Chairman Douglas Cox said.
Like all tribes, the Menominee use a mix of funding to pay for services ranging from a police force and tribal court system to a large health clinic and K-8 school. Menominee Indian High School is a state school district and is not affected by the shutdown.
There are 9,300 enrolled Menominee members with about 4,000 living on or near the reservation.
Cox estimates about 60 percent of the tribe's $19 million annual operating budget is funded through federal grants. Cox and other leaders are reviewing the tribe's finances daily during the shutdown to ensure services continue to be provided.
Cox is worried money due to the tribes from this federal government shutdown will never be paid because Congress would have to approve paying those funds separately.
"We certainly hope this (shutdown) doesn't continue and they come to some resolution so they're no longer holding back our dollars for something so frivolous," Cox said in a phone interview.

Texto completo: GREEN BAY - The children had just awakened from a nap and were still rubbing sleep from their eyes when they pulled up tiny chairs at two small U-shaped tables.
Bowing their heads to say grace in their Oneida native language, the Head Start students were about to snack on Kiwi slices and rice cakes washed down with cups of water.
The Oneida Nation spends $233,000 annually on its Head Start program, which oversees 152 children at two locations on the reservation. Almost three-fourths of Head Start funding for the Green Bay-area tribe is paid through federal funds — roughly $172,000.
But all federal funds flowing to the Oneida and other Wisconsin tribes, as well as Indian tribes across the country, have dried up since the federal government shutdown.
Wisconsin tribes are using their own funds to continue to provide education, health, law enforcement, food pantries and other services, but if the shutdown lasts much longer — and there's no sign of the impasse ending any time soon — some services could be curtailed or cut, hiring might be frozen, workers could be laid off and other drastic measures taken.
"We're fortunate we have the infrastructure and manpower here. A lot of tribes don't have that," Oneida Vice Chairman Brandon Yellowbird Stevens said. "We can supplant the loss of funds with emergency contingency funding."
But the tribe's emergency funding is not limitless and it's designed for emergencies, and no one knows how long the federal shutdown, already the longest, will last.
The Bureau of Indian Affairs has furloughed 2,295 of its 4,057 employees, the New York Times reported.
When Oneida self-government coordinator Candice Skenandore tries to contact someone at the bureau, which she does daily for her job, she gets automatic email replies that the person she's trying to reach is on furlough for an indefinite time. It's the same for voicemail.
Skenandore is in the middle of negotiations for a new funding agreement for the tribe's health services and she's waiting for grant approvals and funding OKs for several programs. But everything is on hold and Skenandore knows it will take several weeks, if not months, for federal employees to get up to speed once the shutdown ends.
Skenandore is supposed to attend a tribal self-governance advisory board meeting in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 21, but she's not sure if the meeting will be held.
The shutdown "is stopping us from doing what we need to do to improve our health services," said Skenandore, whose position is federally funded. The tribe is paying her salary during the shutdown.
About 1.9 million American Indians and Alaska Natives receive basic services from the Department of Interior's Bureau of Indian Affairs. Some tribes, like the Oneida, administer services funded by BIA money, while other tribes have their programs run by federal workers, many of whom are tribal members.
Services tied to decades-old treaties Because of treaties negotiated decades ago, the money funneled to tribes for health care, education, law enforcement and other services is in exchange for tribal nations giving up millions of acres of land in the 1800s. In effect, the tribes prepaid with land for funds now held up by the shutdown.
There's no guarantee tribes will ever see that money. Stevens said the Oneida tribe never got the money it was owed and was not paid during the government shutdown of 2013.
"We ceded millions of acres of land and, in return, the United States said they would pay for health and education," Stevens said.
The Oneida tribe was based in New York at the time and gave up 3 million acres. It later moved to Wisconsin.
Stevens points out that the Oneida were among America's first allies, fighting alongside American troops and helping feed George Washington's army when it was hunkered down at Valley Forge during the brutal winter of 1777. The tribe continues to receive a symbolic annuity payment of $1,800 each year from the Treasury Department as part of a treaty signed at the end of the Revolutionary War.
The tribe operates a 48-bed nursing home and a health center that handles 350,000 patient visits annually, offering family practice, internal medicine, behavioral health, dental, optical and public health services among other things. Its pharmacy dispenses between 1,000 and 1,200 prescriptions daily, said Debbie Danforth, comprehensive health director for operations.
Last week Danforth was on a conference call with other tribal health directors and learned that while some tribes are able to continue to provide services during the shutdown like the Oneida, some might have to close their clinics in a few weeks.
'It's truly scary' "It's truly scary for some tribes," Danforth said.
Of the Oneida Nation's roughly $490 million 2019 fiscal year budget, about $50 million comes from federal grants and self-governance funds. There are 17,165 enrolled members in the Oneida tribe with more than 4,400 living on the reservation, including 1,000 who are 55 or older.
"Our message to Congress: these should not be discretionary, we shouldn't be the first to be cut," Stevens said.
Wisconsin's other tribes are facing the same difficulties as the Oneida.
The Stockbridge-Munsee tribe is the largest employer in Shawano County with about 900 employees. The tribe does not have its own school system but provides tutors and a public safety officer for school districts where tribal members attend, in Gresham and Bowler. It handles snowplowing and repairing roads for many smaller communities in Shawano County.
About 1,475 people are enrolled in the Stockbridge-Munsee tribe with 500 living on the reservation.
"But many of those are aging so their health care needs are great," Stockbridge-Munsee President Shannon Holsey said.
"A majority of our citizens are no longer in the workforce. They're living on fixed incomes and they look to the tribal nations for needs such as transportation to medical appointments and healthy food distribution through Meals on Wheels," Holsey said.
The biggest priority for the Stockbridge-Munsee tribe is its rural health clinic in Bowler, which offers general medicine, dental, behavioral health, chiropractic and community health services as well as a pharmacy.

Cox is worried money due to the tribes from this federal government shutdown will never be paid because Congress would have to approve paying those funds separately, just like it is expected to do for federal workers who are not getting paychecks.
"We certainly hope this (shutdown) doesn't continue and they come to some resolution so they're no longer holding back our dollars for something so frivolous," Cox said in a phone interview.

BUSINESS BEAT; CEO, former Times execs leave Tribune Publishing

Texto completo: Tribune Publishing, after months of turmoil, has shaken up its leadership in a dramatic overhaul that further distances the company's management from its former chairman, Michael Ferro.
The Chicago-based company announced late Thursday that Chief Executive Justin Dearborn was stepping down after nearly three years in the job. Dearborn was a longtime business associate of Ferro, who quit the board nearly a year ago amid allegations of sexual misconduct, which he denied. Ferro remains the largest shareholder of the newspaper company.
Tribune Publishing's board appointed longtime publishing executive Timothy P. Knight as Dearborn's replacement.

In addition, former Congressman David Dreier was elected chairman of the board, replacing Dearborn, who also had filled that role. Dreier, who has served on Tribune Publishing's board since 2016, represented part of Southern California's Inland Empire in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1981 until 2013.
The company's stock slid 8.1% on Friday to $12.21 a share. It's still up 7.7% this year so far.
Tribune Publishing was the parent company of the Los Angeles Times and the San Diego Union-Tribune until June, when biotech entrepreneur Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong purchased the two Southern California papers for $500 million. Soon-Shiong, who remains Tribune Publishing's second-largest shareholder, began investing resources in the California papers after years of staff cutbacks.
The newspaper industry has been under siege amid a defection of advertisers to digital platforms. Tribune Publishing has encountered other problems too, including an ill-fated decision to rebrand itself as Tronc.
The company failed to quell an uprising in Los Angeles, and The Times' newsroom voted overwhelmingly in early 2018 to form a union -- the first time in the paper's more than 135-year history. Tragedy struck at Tribune Publishing's newspaper in Annapolis, Md., when a gunman entered the newsroom and killed five members of the Capital Gazette.
Then, late last month, Tribune's computer networks were infected by a malware attack, which delayed the distribution of newspapers in Los Angeles, San Diego and regions where Tribune operates. The California newspapers share computer systems with their former parent.
In addition to the Chicago Tribune and the Annapolis Capital Gazette, the company owns the New York Daily News, Baltimore Sun, Hartford Courant, Orlando Sentinel, South Florida Sun-Sentinel, the Morning Call in Allentown, Pa., the Daily Press in Newport News, Va., and the Virginian-Pilot in Norfolk, Va.
The shake-up comes as Tribune Publishing has been actively seeking buyers, and it reached out to USA Today owner Gannett Co. in hopes of striking a deal. In December, the company broke off negotiations to sell the newspaper chain to the California-based McClatchy Co. The Chicago Tribune, citing sources familiar with the process, reported that the New York-based investment firm Donerail and Dallas-based newspaper group Aim Media have also been working on a joint bid to buy Tribune Publishing.
In addition to Dearborn, two executives who briefly led The Times -- Ross Levinsohn and his deputy, Mickie Rosen -- were let go Thursday, according to a person familiar with the situation but not authorized to speak publicly. Levinsohn, a former Fox TV executive, was The Times' publisher for about five months during much of the upheaval.
Since being removed from The Times, Levinsohn and Rosen served as chief executive and president, respectively, of the company's digital arm, Tribune Interactive.
The changes suggest that Tribune Publishing's board wanted to entrust the company once again to executives who have had careers in publishing.
Dearborn, 49, joined the firm as its CEO in February 2016, three weeks after Ferro became the company's largest shareholder and non-executive chairman. It was his first job in a senior newspaper role. Before joining Tribune Publishing, Dearborn had been chief executive of Merge Healthcare, a Ferro-controlled medical technology company that was acquired by IBM in 2015.
Knight, 53, also worked for Ferro, previously serving as chief executive of Wrapports, the Ferro-controlled former ownership group of the Chicago Sun-Times. He joined Tribune Publishing nearly two years ago and most recently was in charge of the company's local markets.
Before that, Knight served as president of Advance Ohio and was a top executive of Newsday in New York. Knight, an attorney, began his media career with the Chicago Tribune's legal department in 1996.
"Tim's deep knowledge of our company and his commitment to expand our paid digital business will be critically important," Dreier said in a statement. "Journalism is under attack across the globe and we have an unwavering commitment to delivering a first-rate news product."

Texto completo: CHICAGO - Tribune Publishing CEO Justin Dearborn has stepped down after nearly three years at the helm, the Chicago-based newspaper company announced Thursday.
Longtime Chicago newspaper executive Tim Knight was named CEO, effective immediately. Knight, who had served as president of the company, will also join the Tribune Publishing board.
Board member David Dreier, a former congressman, has been named chairman of Tribune Publishing, replacing Dearborn.
The company also announced the departures Thursday of Ross Levinsohn and Mickie Rosen, who served as CEO and president, respectively, of Tribune Interactive, the digital arm of Tribune Publishing.
The moves come as Tribune Publishing is engaged in a formal sale process. In December, the company terminated negotiations to sell the newspaper chain to the California-based McClatchy Co. New York-based investment firm Donerail and Dallas-based newspaper group Aim Media are working on a joint bid to buy Tribune Publishing, according to multiple sources familiar with negotiations. Tribune Publishing is the parent company of the Chicago Tribune.
Tribune Publishing also owns the Baltimore Sun; Hartford Courant; Orlando Sentinel; the New York Daily News; the Capital Gazette in Annapolis, Md.; The Morning Call in Allentown, Pa.; the Daily Press in Newport News, Va.; and The Virginian-Pilot in Norfolk, Va. The company reverted to its legacy name in October.
Dearborn, 49, joined Tribune Publishing as CEO in February 2016, three weeks after his longtime business associate, Michael Ferro, became the company's largest shareholder and non-executive chairman. Ferro stepped down from the board last year. Dearborn had been CEO of Merge Healthcare, a Ferro-controlled medical technology company that was acquired by IBM in 2015.
Knight, 53, previously served as CEO of Wrapports, the former ownership group of the Chicago Sun-Times.
Levinsohn, 55, joined Tribune Publishing in 2017 as publisher and CEO of the Los Angeles Times, which was then owned by the Chicago-based company. He was placed on unpaid leave in January 2018 in the wake of published reports that he was a defendant in two sexual harassment lawsuits while an executive at other media companies.
Following an independent investigation, Levinsohn was reinstated by the company in February and shifted to a new role.

Texto completo: “…internal company emails, text messages, and a cache of other documents. ”
This might be the most important phrase you will read today, perhaps in many days, maybe even in your lifetime.
It comes from the BuzzFeed report Thursday night that President Donald Trump told his lawyer Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about Trump Tower Moscow — because he didn’t want it known that he was negotiating a lucrative project with Russia and Vladimir Putin while he was campaigning for, and winning, the Republican presidential nomination. Cohen gave this information to special counsel Robert Mueller, but only after Mueller apparently already knew and had it in writing.
Cohen’s checkered history and many lies have always meant investigators would need documentation to back up his statements. And now, if the Buzzfeed report holds up, it appears they have it, obstruction of justice and suborning perjury on a platter. If you didn’t believe yesterday that impeachment was inevitable, you should start believing it today.
As former Clinton administration lawyer Ronald Klain tweeted Friday, answering a question on articles of impeachment from MSNBC's Lawrence O'Donnell, "I don't know how many is too many, but I do know that one is enough. "
Read more commentary:
Ex-GOP rep to Democrats: Gear up to impeach Trump. It's your constitutional duty.
All signs point the same way: Putin has compromising information on Donald Trump
Watergate lawyer: Michael Cohen is no John Dean but he still might bring down Trump
I would not ask Republicans in the Senate to commit at this point to trying and convicting Trump if in fact, as seems increasingly likely, the Democratic-led House impeaches him. But I think it is fair to ask Republicans right now: Do you really want to continue this record-long government shutdown because of a preposterous and largely symbolic campaign promise by a presidential candidate who never thought he’d win? A candidate who then and now puts his business interests and material wealth ahead of the national interest? Who insists on shutdown chaos that is hurting American workers, taxpayers, national security and the economy, even as it shakes trust in democracy and warms Putin’s heart?
Where will congressional Republicans draw the line and start making their own best judgments, for their constituents and their nation?
A turning point for Trump and GOP
BuzzFeed produced a bombshell, all right, and for more than one reason. The report clues us in to what Mueller may know. It could well be a turning point in this presidency and, one can only hope, within the GOP. And it was a revelation. Unlike so many other possible crimes, like asking Russia to find Hillary Clinton’s emails and saying he fired FBI director James Comey over "this Russia thing," Trump hadn’t already announced this on Twitter or TV.
So here we have a presidential candidate whose lawyer and children are reportedly negotiating a lucrative ($300 million) real estate deal with Russian officials, whose party is making its platform friendlier to Russia, whose aides and advisers (at least 16) are meeting with Russians, who conveys he's eager for Russian help, and who constantly makes clear he admires and trusts Putin.
All through the campaign and into 2017, Trump dishonestly denies any business dealings with Russia. Then the investigations begin, and so does the lying about the Moscow project, and so does the speculation about its possible role in Trump's embrace of Putin. The Russian president knew Trump and Cohen were lying and could expose them (the kompromat theory)? Trump still hopes to do the project and make the money? As he said himself, if he hadn't won, "why should I lose lots of opportunities?"
BuzzFeed bombshell not the only one
The awful thing is that BuzzFeed's potentially earthshaking nugget wasn’t the only shocking information that came out Thursday. The Wall Street Journal reported that Cohen offered a tech firm $50,000 to rig CNBC and Drudge poll results in favor of Trump — at Trump’s direction, Cohen claimed in a tweet after the report appeared. We also learned that many more migrant children were separated from their parents than originally known.
A day earlier, a top Housing and Urban Development official quit, in part over Trump attempts to divert Puerto Rico hurricane aid to Florida and Texas, based on his false claim that Puerto Rico was using the money to pay off its debt. As Vox noted Thursday, Congress directed the money to Puerto Rico so it would have been illegal to take it away.
This came the same week the Washington Post reported that Trump has gone to great lengths to hide details of his talks with Putin. And that was a day after the New York Times report that when Trump fired Comey, the FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation into whether the president had been influenced or compromised by Russia.
The Trump presidency has seemed unsustainable since the day it began. Yet two years later, Trump is still in office and moving steadily toward realizing the deeply pessimistic vision he laid out in his inaugural address. Each new court filing and investigative report is a step toward making it stop. And each Republican who breaks with Trump can help.
In times of trouble, when things get scary, "look for the helpers," Mister Rogers said. We're looking at you, Republicans, and hoping. Hard.

Texto completo: Tribune Publishing CEO Justin Dearborn has stepped down after nearly three years at the helm, the Chicago-based newspaper company that owns the Orlando Sentinel announced Thursday.
Longtime Chicago newspaper executive Tim Knight was named CEO, effective immediately. Knight, who had served as president of the company, will also join the Tribune Publishing board.
Board member David Dreier, a former U.S. congressman, has been named chairman of Tribune Publishing, replacing Dearborn in that role.
The company also announced the departures Thursday of Ross Levinsohn and Mickie Rosen, who served as CEO and president, respectively, of Tribune Interactive, the digital arm of Tribune Publishing. The executive moves come as Tribune Publishing is actively engaged in a formal sale process. In December, the company terminated negotiations to sell the newspaper chain to California-based McClatchy Co.
New York-based investment firm Donerail and Dallas-based newspaper group Aim Media are working on a joint bid to buy Tribune Publishing, according to multiple sources familiar with negotiations. Tribune Publishing is the parent company of the Chicago Tribune and other major newspapers.
Dearborn, 49, joined Tribune Publishing as CEO in February 2016, three weeks after his longtime business associate, Michael Ferro, became the company's largest shareholder and nonexecutive chairman. Ferro stepped down from the board last year. Dearborn had been CEO of Merge Healthcare, a Ferro-controlled medical technology company that was acquired by IBM in 2015.
A longtime newspaper industry executive, Knight, 53, previously served as CEO of Wrapports, the Ferro-led former ownership group of the Chicago Sun-Times.
Knight, an attorney, began his media career with the Chicago Tribune's legal department in 1996. He later was named publisher of Newsday, then owned by Tribune Co., the former parent of the Chicago Tribune. He rejoined Tribune Publishing, formerly known as Tronc, as president of digital content in February 2017 and was named president of the company in October of that year.
Tribune Publishing also owns the Baltimore Sun; Hartford Courant; the New York Daily News; the Capital Gazette in Annapolis, Md.; The Morning Call in Allentown, Pa.; the Daily Press in Newport News, Va.; and The Virginian-Pilot in Norfolk, Va. The company reverted to its legacy name in October.

Texto completo: William Barr, President Donald Trump’s nominee for attorney general, gave assurances to the Senate Judiciary Committee this week that he would not interfere with special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of Trump team ties to Russia. He was far vaguer on what would happen to Mueller’s anticipated report when he received it.
My interpretation of Barr’s testimony is that he would not release Mueller’s report. Portions of that report, Barr said, would be excised because of national security, privacy and other concerns based on regulations and practice. He would not, however, release the balance with the excised portions blacked out, as Mueller has in publicly released court filings. Rather, Barr would write his own report based on Mueller's findings, and this alone is what he would make public. In addition to not seeing crucial parts of Mueller’s report, the public will not know the nature or extent of the deletions and changes.
Read more commentary:
Watergate lawyer: Michael Cohen is no John Dean but he still might bring down Trump
Barr’s nomination should be withdrawn: Sen. Warner
Make John McCain proud of the Senate. Demand promises from Barr on Mueller.
That state of affairs is obviously unacceptable. The public is entitled to know what is in the report, except the minimum that the law reasonably says should be withheld. There is no sure way to prevent Mueller’s conscientious and essential effort from being censored and distorted. There are, however, steps that can be taken by various persons to minimize both the likelihood and extent of the censorship and distortion.
Watergate and Pentagon papers show the way
First, the Senate should demand from Barr a firm commitment in writing to release the entire Mueller report other than portions that the law clearly prohibits from disclosure. While the hearing is over, no vote has taken place. This may not succeed.
Second, Mueller should disclose in court filings as much of the information that he will include in his report as he properly can. Substantial portions of the filings will undoubtedly be blacked out at the time of the filing, but perhaps they can be disclosed later. Those disclosures will be up to federal judges, however, not the Trump administration.
Third, people with access to the report should make and secrete copies. If and when the time comes that Barr does not release Mueller’s report, copies should be given to Congress or, as a last resort, leaked to the news media and, of course, widely disseminated.
The famous example of the Pentagon Papers and its publication by The New York Times, The Washington Post, and other newspapers provides a precedent. While the executive branch would try to hunt down the leakers, everything should be done to prevent their identification and prosecution. Nevertheless, this action will require some individuals to put their careers and freedom at risk.
Fourth, Americans should prepare to object forcefully if Barr fails to make Mueller’s report public. This item requires lengthier explanation.
Public protests and pressure shaped history
In October 1973, President Richard Nixon got rid of special prosecutor Archibald Cox, who had subpoenaed nine tape recordings Nixon made of conversations he had with aides on the subject of Watergate and said he would subpoena more. Only the attorney general could fire Cox, and Elliott Richardson resigned rather than fire Cox as Nixon ordered. Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus also refused to fire Cox and likewise departed. Third in line, Solicitor General Robert Bork agreed to fire Cox (an action that later helped cost him advancement to the Supreme Court). Nixon announced both that Cox was fired and that the special prosecution force was disbanded.
Then a funny thing happened. The country erupted in protest. Television commentators excoriated Nixon’s action, which the press promptly dubbed “The Saturday Night Massacre. ” People marched in the streets and cars blew their horns. Members of Congress introduced petitions of impeachment against Nixon.
When the White House and lawyers from the special prosecution force appeared several days later before Judge John Sirica, the no-nonsense judge overseeing the Watergate grand jury and prosecutions, the White House agreed to turn over to the special prosecutor the tapes he had subpoenaed. The office of the special prosecutor was resurrected, and a new (and aggressive) successor to Cox, Leon Jaworski, was placed in charge.
While the process was filled with trauma, the investigation of Nixon and his aides continued under Jaworski. Eventually, Nixon resigned on Aug. 9, 1974, and his top aides, former attorney general John Mitchell, former chief of staff H. R. Haldeman and former domestic adviser John Ehrlichman were tried and convicted of a number of crimes and sent to prison.
It was far from a sure thing, and it required many dedicated and principled individuals, including federal judges, to accomplish. And it certainly did not happen by accident.

Women say march is still an important step

Texto completo: Why march again?
That's what many women are wondering as they consider Saturday's third annual women's marches planned in Washington, Boston, and cities across the country. The movement that united women in spontaneous fury two years ago has itself broken down into divisions, as one of its national leaders, who is black, has failed to dispel perceptions of anti-Semitism.
The marches come three months after a Supreme Court nominee accused of sexual assault was confirmed, solidifying a conservative court that could well overturn Roe v. Wade, the ruling that legalized abortion. And President Trump — whose inauguration prompted women's first outpouring of anger — is still president and still offending them, even if he no longer surprises.
Women participating again this year suggest the march is not the point of their activism, but the exclamation point. In between marches, organizers are keeping the grass roots aflame long after the scorching anti-Trump signs are squashed. For evidence of their impact, they say, look no further than the wave of women newly elected to political office. Headlining this year's march in Boston: Representative Ayanna Pressley, whose upset win made her the first black woman to represent Massachusetts in Congress.
“For me, this women's march is not about Trump," said Susan Ward, 54, an Acton woman who plans to march in Washington on Saturday. “It's about the fact that there is a large number of women that are organizing. And when you organize, or have a voice, it empowers other women to have a voice."
Plans for the Washington march — always down to the wire — have been especially spotty amid a government shutdown, a bad weather forecast, and a racially divisive controversy that has cost the D.C. leadership team sponsors and participants.
The Boston event — beginning at 10 a.m. on Boston Common — is run independently of the national women's march but is suffering from brand confusion.
“Without question, the controversies surrounding [Women's March Inc.] and its leadership have complicated our efforts to organize this year's march, even though we have no connection to [Women's March Inc.] formally or informally," said Karen Clawson Cosmas, executive director of the Boston event's host, March Forward Massachusetts.
March Forward Massachusetts is the group that drew an estimated 175,000 people to the Common the day after Trump's inauguration in 2017. A second annual demonstration was moved to Cambridge, planned with partner organizations, and drew roughly 10,000.
But for most women mobilized by the marches, the real work has been happening in between the events. Nationally, in all-politics-is-local fashion, many women worked through “huddles," neighborhood groups formed to work on their own electoral agendas.
In Massachusetts, many campaigned for Question 3, the ballot question that protected transgender people's rights against discrimination. And since the state was already secure with an all-Democratic congressional delegation friendly to women's rights, some turned their progressive attention to candidates in other states. The Walnut Street Huddle in Brookline, for instance, raised money for Pennsylvania's Chrissy Houlahan and made phone calls for Lauren Underwood of Illinois and Gina Ortiz Jones of Texas. Closer to home, they hit the pavement for Jared Golden in Maine and Chris Pappas in New Hampshire.
Organizations that work with the march also have seen a surge in activism from new volunteers and channeled them to new forms of political engagement. The Jewish Alliance for Law and Social Action created a new political arm, called JALSA Impact, which tapped 100 volunteers to make 4,500 phone calls for five congressional candidates, including Abby Finkenauer in Iowa, Debbie Mucarsel-Powell in Florida, and Antonio Delgado in New York.
“For us, working on the issues that the march is speaking about is not just a one-day event," said Cindy Rowe, JALSA Impact executive director. “It really is the heart of our mission, the pursuit of social, economic, environmental, and racial justice based on our deeply held Jewish values."
Activists' eagerness to tout their Jewish values and allies this year owes to the controversy that has been brewing behind the scenes.
Two national Women's March leaders have been associated with Louis Farrakhan, the leader of the Nation of Islam who blames Jews in particular for black oppression. Tamika Mallory, a black anti-gun-violence activist and copresident of the D.C. march, appeared with him last fall and has since failed to distance herself from him, leading many to urge her to step down. In November, the Hawaii woman who launched the original idea for the Women's March on Facebook said in a post that leaders were letting racist rhetoric fester “by their refusal to separate themselves from groups that espouse these racist, hateful beliefs."
Tension only worsened after another original founder of the national march told The New York Times that she believes she was shunted aside, in part because of her Jewish identity. The dispute has become so heated that the Democratic National Committee backed out of sponsoring the D.C. march and the Jewish Telegraphic Agency provided a list detailing which local marches are not affiliated with the national leaders.
In a Monday appearance on ABC's “The View," Mallory continued to defend her loyalty to Farrakhan based on his work for the black community. Though she said she did not agree with his anti-Semitic remarks, she refused to condemn them.
Now, in a vivid display of the division, major cities — including Washington, New York City, and Philadelphia — will host two separate women's marches.
One will be affiliated with Women's March Inc. — the name trademarked by the official national leaders — and one will be staged by local activists who do not want to be associated with that group.
Some of those who still want to march are tuning out the rancor.
“I've become an activist since the women's march," said Ward, a neuroscientist who said that she'd previously never felt the need to protest during her three decades in liberal Massachusetts.
“I didn't feel the pain myself, and I didn't feel I had to do it," she said. “But now I realize that I need to step up and speak out for people who are marginalized."
So she and her sister are again heading to Washington, where she'll feed off the energy for the next round of activism back home.
“If it's not as big as it was two years ago, I don't even care," Ward said. “You can't not do something."

Texto completo: Michael D. Cohen, the former personal lawyer and fixer for President Trump, acknowledged on Thursday that he had paid the owner of a technology services company to help doctor results of an online poll to help Trump as he considered a run for president.
In a post on Twitter about his actions, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, Cohen said that he had done so at the direction of Trump, and regretted it.
Cohen wrote: “As for the @WSJ article on poll rigging, what I did was at the direction of and for the sole benefit of @realDonaldTrump @POTUS. I truly regret my blind loyalty to a man who doesn't deserve it."
The Journal reported that in early 2015, before Trump declared himself a candidate for president, Cohen gave $12,000 to $13,000 in cash stuffed in a Walmart bag to John Gauger, the owner of RedFinch Solutions, who also works for Liberty University. The money was in exchange for help boosting Trump's name in two online polls.
Cohen was supposed to pay Gauger $50,000 for the work, the man told The Journal, but the full amount was never paid out. However, Cohen billed the Trump Organization $50,000 for technology services, according to federal prosecutors in Manhattan, who referenced the amount in a charging document.
Cohen has agreed to testify before the House Committee on Oversight and Reform on Feb. 7. Cohen's testimony will be restricted to avoid issues directly related to the special counsel investigation into whether there was collusion by anyone in the Trump campaign with Russian officials.

Conway spouse jabs Trump, is labeled 'bad husband'
President Trump's 2020 campaign manager, Brad Parscale, publicly branded White House counselor Kellyanne Conway's spouse a bad husband Wednesday in response to his latest barb directed at the president — this one over Trump's misspelling of "hamburger."
The latest flare-up in the escalating drama involving lawyer and frequent Trump critic George Conway stemmed from the visit of the Clemson Tigers football team to the White House on Monday night. Hamstrung by the partial government shutdown, Trump served the team fast food, including Whoppers from Burger King, which he said he paid for out of his own pocket.
Trump relived the gathering the following morning on Twitter, writing: "Great being with the National Champion Clemson Tigers last night at the White House. Because of the Shutdown I served them massive amounts of Fast Food (I paid), over 1000 hamberders etc. Within one hour, it was all gone. Great guys and big eaters!"
Trump soon deleted the tweet and replaced it with one in which "hamburgers" was correctly spelled.
Burger King, nevertheless, took note, responding in a tweet that "due to a large order placed yesterday, we're all out of hamberders."
George Conway, who has previously questioned Trump's veracity and respect for the law, pounced on Wednesday.
"Think of how much of a laughingstock a president has to become to have *Burger King* make fun of him. Sad," he wrote in a searing tweet.
Responding to Conway's tweet, Parscale shot back: "Think how bad of a husband you have to be to act this way."

Spoof kids' books donated to Karen Pence's school
Here's a donation that probably isn't too welcome: The Trevor Project, an organization that supports LGBTQ young people, is sending 100 copies of a book about the family rabbit of Vice President Mike Pence to a school in Northern Virginia.
The recipient, Immanuel Christian School, is the institution where second lady Karen Pence is teaching art — the one with policies that ban gay or transgender people from enrolling or being employed there — and the book is "A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo," a story promoting acceptance and marriage equality that's a spoof of Karen Pence's own children's book about the family's bunny.
The books were penned by a writer for HBO's "Last Week Tonight with John Oliver," and feature a story line about Marlon Bundo falling in love and eventually marrying another boy bunny. In it, Vice President Pence is portrayed as a stink bug who disapproves, and is later voted out of being "In Charge" by the animals.

Poll sees Generation Z as more diverse, leaning left
Students from Parkland, Fla., became some of the country's most effective opponents of gun violence after a man fatally shot 17 people at their Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. The teens are organized, well-researched, and poised. They've weathered social media abuse with maturity because they've been dealing with it their entire lives.
According to a new poll from the Pew Research Center, the teens may offer a window into the politics of Generation Z more broadly.
Generation Z, defined as those born after 1996, is nearing adulthood. The oldest among them are graduating college. By 2020, almost half will be eligible to vote in the presidential election, which means their values and opinions could soon help shape national politics.
According to the survey, released Thursday, Gen Z teens and young adults have overwhelmingly adopted left-leaning beliefs similar to the millennials before them. They overwhelmingly disapprove of President Trump, believe the government should do more, and reject American exceptionalism.
It's not uncommon for young people to hold liberal views that moderate as they age. But Gen Zers grew up in a very different world than previous generations. The oldest among them was just 11 when the first black president was elected. They became teenagers as same-sex marriage was legalized around the country. They also, according to Pew, will be the most racially diverse and well-educated generation.
This younger generation is much more likely to see climate change as a result of human behavior and to believe black Americans are treated unfairly.

They Believe King's No Bigot. But They Agree He's Finished.

Texto completo: FORT DODGE, Iowa -- The coffee crew at Zakeer's still likes Steve King. They voted for him over and over and don't believe he is a bigot. They say he's getting a raw deal from the news media and Republicans in Washington.
But here's the thing: These rock-solid supporters of Mr. King, whose comments seeming to endorse white supremacy brought stinging rebukes from his own party leaders, are also convinced that his 16-year career in Congress representing northwest Iowa is effectively over.
"I think he's dead in the water," said Pat Reed, a retired history teacher in a purple University of Northern Iowa sweatshirt, reacting to the news that House Republicans this week had stripped Mr. King of his positions on the Agriculture and Judiciary Committees.
"I think he's done," echoed Ross Nemitz, the owner of Ross's Appliance Center in Fort Dodge, a small blue-collar city in the heart of Mr. King's district full of agribusinesses.
Every rural Iowa community has its Zakeer's, a cafe with a table of early morning regulars -- a Greek chorus speaking with a collective voice on dramas playing out on the local and national stage.
The men at Zakeer's have had breakfast together for more than 20 years. They keep attendance logs and play a game of chance to see who picks up the coffee tab. (On Wednesday the loser was an out-of-town reporter.)
For Mr. King, 69, losing the chorus at Zakeer's spells deep trouble. A copy of The Des Moines Register on a table displayed a top-of-the-page headline, "House rebukes King." It upstaged the story of Gov. Kim Reynolds's State of the State speech.
Mr. King was also the top story on WHO, a conservative talk radio station broadcasting across much of his vast, 39-county district of corn and soybean fields, whose black furrows lay under two inches of snow.
John Kilmer, a retired truck-driver listening from an adjacent table, who had voted for Mr. King in the midterms, said now he must resign. "They've stripped him of his committees and he's just taking up space," he said.
And it wasn't just voters who think Mr. King's career is nearing an end: Republican officials are already planning to move past him, and are busy recruiting and raising money for primary challengers in 2020 if he does not step down.
Mr. King says he has no plans to seek "another line of work," as Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Senate majority leader, recommended this week. He pushed back on Wednesday in a fund-raising letter to supporters, writing that "the unhinged Left has teamed up with Republican 'NeverTrumpers' and is pulling out all the stops to destroy me."
He attacked The New York Times, which published a quotation from him in an article last week that led to the firestorm in Congress.
"White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization -- how did that language become offensive?" Mr. King told The Times, comments he now says were taken out of context.
Some longtime supporters in Mr. King's Fourth District said that even if the nine-term congressman defiantly stays on, they will most likely back a primary challenger. Two candidates announced this week that they would jump into the race, including a prominent Republican state lawmaker, Randy Feenstra, and others are expected.
The Fort Dodge Messenger, which in November endorsed Mr. King over his Democratic challenger, J.D. Scholten, issued an unusual correction on Wednesday night calling on Mr. King to resign.
"It is now clear that the endorsement we made was a mistake," the editorial board wrote. "We should have pondered more carefully King's pattern of making outrageous statements."
There are many reasons Mr. King has been re-elected repeatedly despite years of white identity politics and demeaning comments about Hispanic immigrants, whom he has compared to dogs, dirt and drug mules "with calves the size of cantaloupes."
The most basic reason may be the deeply conservative nature of his district, where Republicans almost always triumph: President Trump carried it by 27 points. Mr. King's conservatism on abortion and gun rights lines up with a majority of his constituents, as does his reputation as an outsider defying the party establishment.
Some supporters said the rebuke by party leaders in Washington and Des Moines would only increase his appeal and backfire on those hoping he leaves Congress.
"Now that they've stripped him of his committee assignments, I've seen people dig in their heels and say, 'No, Congressman King is one of us, Congressman King is a pro-life, pro-gun, pro-conservative person, just like we are,"' said Jacob Hall, who leads an activist group, Sioux County Conservatives.
Mr. Hall disputed the notion that Mr. King's latest comments about white supremacy would move many votes one way or the other.
"There's nothing anybody is going to hear Congressman King say that's going to change their mind about him, whether they're a supporter or a detractor," he said. "Our minds are made up in the Fourth District."
But the results of November's midterms call into question that view. Mr. King barely squeaked out a three-point victory, after winning by 23 points two years earlier. His support plummeted late in the race after he endorsed a Toronto mayoral candidate with neo-Nazi ties and met with members of a far-right Austrian party accused of trivializing the Holocaust. The chairman of the House Republican election committee issued a stinging rebuke of him a week before the election, labeling him a white supremacist.
Many Iowa Republican officials fear that if Mr. King is on the ballot in November 2020, he will drive up Democratic turnout, threatening other Republicans running, especially Senator Joni Ernst.
"Down-ballot and up-ballot he's definitely a liability," said Dane Nealson, a former Republican chairman of Story County, the largest and most Democratic county in Mr. King's district.
Ms. Ernst may be vulnerable even if Mr. King is not running, after distancing herself from him only this week, as did Iowa's senior senator, Charles E. Grassley, and Governor Reynolds. Each had spent years embracing Mr. King because they needed his conservative base of voters.
"Grassley, Joni Ernst, Kim Reynolds, they could have taken a stance on this years ago," said Troy Price, chairman of the Iowa Democratic Party. "It's appalling; it's a failure of leadership on their part."
Opponents of Mr. King, and even some of his supporters, have long been frustrated by the impression he gives to non-Iowans who think his 16 years in office prove that his constituents are racists.
"I'm embarrassed by him," said Amy Presler, 48, a librarian in Fort Dodge, who grew up on a farm as the youngest of 10 siblings. "I don't want people in the nation and the world to think that Iowans are behind him and support that sort of talk. We don't."
Mr. King's racist remarks over the years have mainly been directed at undocumented Latino immigrants. He was years ahead of Mr. Trump in calling for a concrete border wall, in demonizing migrants as violent criminals and opposing any plan to legalize "Dreamers" as a form of amnesty.
Mike McCarville, a former Fort Dodge mayor, said that when it came to the many Latinos who work in meatpacking, construction and agriculture in the region, native-born Iowans could be "two-faced."
"All the farmers will bitch about all the Hispanics," he said, "but they hire them and we can't get along without them."
"If they accomplished what they say they want and just round them all up and ship them back, our economy would grind to a halt," he added.
On Monday, after House Republicans stripped Mr. King of his committee assignments, Lorena Lopez, the publisher of La Prensa, a Spanish-language newspaper in the district, received a flood of texts and emails from readers. "Every Latino knows how he has been, his negative comments especially against Latinos," she said.
The response of the Latino community, she said, has been simple: "It is about time."
Back at Zakeer's, the coffee crew said that Mr. King's loss of committee assignments means the Fourth District now has no seat at the table in Congress.
"No matter how much you may like the guy, if that person can't represent you as well because he's been stripped of powers ..." began Mr. Nemitz, the appliance dealer.
Mr. Reed, the retired schoolteacher, finished the sentence: "Then there isn't much sense of being there."

But Pat Reed, right, says, "I think he's dead in the water."; Mr. King's office in Fort Dodge, left. Amy Presler, right, a local librarian, said she was frustrated by Mr. King: "I don't want people in the nation and the world to think that Iowans are behind him and support that sort of talk. We don't." (PHOTOGRAPHS BY KATHRYN GAMBLE FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)

No, the government shutdown isn’t a ‘crisis’

Texto completo: This government shutdown is now longer than any in history. The media keep using the word “crisis.”
“Shutdown sows chaos, confusion and anxiety!” says The Washington Post. “Pain spreads widely.”
The New York Times headlined, it’s all “just too much!”
But wait. Looking around America, I see people going about their business — families eating in restaurants, employees going to work, children playing in playgrounds, etc. I have to ask: Where’s the crisis?
Pundits talk as if government is the most important part of America, but it isn’t.
We need some government, limited government. But most of life, the best of life, goes on without government, many of the best parts in spite of government.
Of course, the shutdown is a big deal to the 800,000 people who aren’t being paid. But they will get paid. Government workers always do — after shutdowns.
Columnist Paul Krugman calls this shutdown, “Trump’s big libertarian experiment.” But it’s not libertarian. Government’s excessive rules are still in effect, and eventually government workers will be paid for not working. That makes this a most un-libertarian experiment.
But there are lessons to be learned.
During a shutdown when Barack Obama was president, government officials were so eager to make a point by inconveniencing people that they even stopped visitors from entering public parks.
Trump’s administration isn’t doing that, so PBS found a new crisis: “Trash cans spilling… (P)ark services can’t clean up the mess until Congress and the president reach a spending deal,” reported “NewsHour.”
But volunteers appeared to pick up some of the trash.
Given a chance, private citizens often step in to do things government says only government can do.
The Washington Post ran a front-page headline about farmers “reeling… because they aren’t receiving government support checks.”
But why do farmers even get “support checks”?
One justification is “saving family farms.” But the money goes to big farms.
Government doesn’t need to “guarantee the food supply,” another justification for subsidies. Most fruit and vegetable farmers get no subsidies, yet there are no shortages of peaches, plums, green beans, etc.
Subsidies are a scam created by politicians who get money from wheat, cotton, corn and soybean agribusinesses. Those farmers should suck it up and live without subsidies, too.
During shutdowns, government tells “nonessential workers” not to come to work. But if they’re nonessential, then why do we pay 400,000 of them?
Why do we still pay 100,000 American soldiers in Germany, Japan, Italy and England? Didn’t we win those wars?
We could take a chainsaw to so much of government.
The New York Times shrieks, “Shutdown Curtails FDA Food Inspections!”
Only if you read on do you learn that meat and poultry inspection is done by the Department of Agriculture. They’re still working. And the FDA is restarting some inspections as well.
More important, meat is usually safe not because of government — but because of competition.
Food sellers worry about their reputations. They know they’ll get bad publicity if they poison people (think Chipotle), so they take many more safety measures than government requires.
One meat producer told me that they employ 2,000 more safety inspectors than the law demands.
Lazy reporters cover politicians. Interviewees are usually in one place — often Washington, D.C. Interviewing politicians is easier than covering people pursuing their own interests all over America. But those are the people who make America work.
While pundits and politicians act as if everything needs government intervention, the opposite is true.
Even security work is done better by the private sector. At San Francisco’s airport, security lines move faster. Passengers told me, “The screeners are nicer!” The TSA even acknowledged that those screeners are better at finding contraband. That’s because San Francisco (Kansas City, Seattle and a dozen smaller airports) privatized the screening process. Private companies are responsible for security.
Private contractors are better because they must compete. Perform badly, and they get fired.
But government never fires itself.
Government workers shout, “We are essential!” But I say: “Give me a break. Most of you are not.”

Of course, the shutdown is a big deal to the 800,000 people who aren’t being paid. But they will get paid. Government workers always do — after shutdowns.
Columnist Paul Krugman calls this shutdown, “Trump’s big libertarian experiment.” But it’s not libertarian. Government’s excessive rules are still in effect, and eventually government workers will be paid for not working. That makes this a most un-libertarian experiment.
But there are lessons to be learned.
During a shutdown when Barack Obama was president, government officials were so eager to make a point by inconveniencing people that they even stopped visitors from entering public parks.
Trump’s administration isn’t doing that, so PBS found a new crisis: “Trash cans spilling… (P)ark services can’t clean up the mess until Congress and the president reach a spending deal,” reported “NewsHour.”
But volunteers appeared to pick up some of the trash.
Given a chance, private citizens often step in to do things government says only government can do.
The Washington Post ran a front-page headline about farmers “reeling… because they aren’t receiving government support checks.”
But why do farmers even get “support checks”?
One justification is “saving family farms.” But the money goes to big farms.
Government doesn’t need to “guarantee the food supply,” another justification for subsidies. Most fruit and vegetable farmers get no subsidies, yet there are no shortages of peaches, plums, green beans, etc.
Subsidies are a scam created by politicians who get money from wheat, cotton, corn and soybean agribusinesses. Those farmers should suck it up and live without subsidies, too.
During shutdowns, government tells “nonessential workers” not to come to work. But if they’re nonessential, then why do we pay 400,000 of them?
Why do we still pay 100,000 American soldiers in Germany, Japan, Italy and England? Didn’t we win those wars?
We could take a chainsaw to so much of government.
The New York Times shrieks, “Shutdown Curtails FDA Food Inspections!”
Only if you read on do you learn that meat and poultry inspection is done by the Department of Agriculture. They’re still working. And the FDA is restarting some inspections as well.
More important, meat is usually safe not because of government — but because of competition.
Food sellers worry about their reputations. They know they’ll get bad publicity if they poison people (think Chipotle), so they take many more safety measures than government requires.
One meat producer told me that they employ 2,000 more safety inspectors than the law demands.
Lazy reporters cover politicians. Interviewees are usually in one place — often Washington, D.C. Interviewing politicians is easier than covering people pursuing their own interests all over America. But those are the people who make America work.
While pundits and politicians act as if everything needs government intervention, the opposite is true.
Even security work is done better by the private sector. At San Francisco’s airport, security lines move faster. Passengers told me, “The screeners are nicer!” The TSA even acknowledged that those screeners are better at finding contraband. That’s because San Francisco (Kansas City, Seattle and a dozen smaller airports) privatized the screening process. Private companies are responsible for security.
Private contractors are better because they must compete. Perform badly, and they get fired.
But government never fires itself.
Government workers shout, “We are essential!” But I say: “Give me a break. Most of you are not.”

Texto completo: A month after CBS denied Les Moonves his $120 million exit package on the grounds that he did not "cooperate fully" with the investigation into his alleged sexual misconduct, the ousted CEO has let it be known he's not going away quietly – or without his money.
On Wednesday, CBS acknowledged in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that Moonves has demanded that he and the network take the matter to binding arbitration.
In the document, which CBS posted to its corporate website, the company acknowledges that Moonves has that right under the separation agreement he signed in September but it maintains that he was fired for cause and therefore is not entitled to any severance pay.
The filing reads, "As previously reported, on December 17, 2018, CBS Corporation. . . announced that its Board of Directors had completed its investigation of the Company’s former Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, Leslie Moonves, and had determined that there were grounds to terminate his employment with the Company for cause under the Company’s employment agreement with Mr. Moonves and that Mr. Moonves will not be entitled to receive any severance payment from the Company. "
It added, "On Jan. 16, 2019, Mr. Moonves notified the Company of his election to demand binding arbitration with respect to this matter. The Company does not intend to comment further on this matter during the pendency of the arbitration proceedings. "
CBS: Ex-CEO Les Moonves will be denied $120 million severance package
Moonves has been accused of varying degrees of sexual misconduct by more than a dozen women.
In an early draft of their report obtained in December by The New York Times, the outside lawyers hired by CBS to conduct the investigation found Moonves, 69, to be "evasive and untruthful at times and to have deliberately lied about and minimized the extent of his sexual misconduct. "
The leaked version of the report said Moonves "engaged in multiple acts of serious nonconsensual sexual misconduct in and outside of the workplace, both before and after he came to CBS in 1995," adding that the former CEO "received oral sex from at least 4 CBS employees under circumstances that sound transactional. "
After CBS announced it would not pay the severance package, Moonves' attorney, Andrew Levander, on Dec. 17 called the decision as "foreordained" and "without merit," in a statement to USA TODAY.
"Consistent with the pattern of leaks that have permeated this 'process,' the press was informed of these baseless conclusions before Mr. Moonves, further damaging his name, reputation, career and legacy," Levander added. "Mr. Moonves vehemently denies any nonconsensual sexual relations and cooperated extensively and fully with investigators. "
Levander's team declined to comment on the arbitration development.

We must remember 'Godmother of Title IX' Sandler

Texto completo: I'm a little embarrassed to admit that I had never heard of Bernice Sandler until reading her obituaries last week.
Sandler died on Jan. 5 in Washington, D.C., at the age of 90. As the news broke, I quickly discovered what an awe-inspiring impact she had made on our society.
In 1969, after earning her doctoral degree in education from the University of Maryland, Sandler began applying for multiple teaching positions, with no success. In one interview, she was told that "she came on too strong for a woman."
That stoked her fire, and she got involved with a variety of groups working to end sexual discrimination in education.
We are drastically shortening a long story, but there were many ups and downs and Sandler was helped by many others – women and men. Ultimately, she played a critical role in the passage of Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972, which was signed into law by President Richard Nixon with zero fanfare.
The key phrase in Title IX is only 31 words: "No person shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any educational program receiving Federal financial assistance."
Title IX also extended to sexual harassment and employment discrimination, but by far its most recognizable impact has been in athletics.
Girls and women were already playing a few organized sports in some high schools and colleges in the early 1970s, but Title IX really opened the floodgates nationwide. I first saw the impact in 1976, as a sixth-grader in Fort Smith, Arkansas.
My sister was part of the band that played at home basketball games at Southside High School. And because my mom had to provide the transportation, I had to come along, too.
This was never a problem because I loved watching the high school boys play basketball. But that year, there was something new. We had to arrive a couple of hours earlier because Southside now had a girls basketball team.
They were awful. They could barely dribble, struggled to know the rules and couldn't shoot worth a lick. And all of the teams they played were just as bad because almost all of the girls involved were just starting to play the game.
So, of course, being sixth-grade boys, my friends and I sat in the stands and made fun of them. We thought this was the dumbest thing we had ever seen. We couldn't understand why this was happening, why we had to watch it.
Needless to say, times have changed drastically over the last 40-plus years. Now I write about high school sports all across Delaware, and I can assure you that I enjoy watching the girls play every sport just as much as the boys. The strength, stamina, dedication and athleticism they show is absolutely amazing.
Most of the girls of today probably don't know that girls basketball started out as six-on-six – basically two half-court games of three-on-three – because the men in charge thought it would be too taxing for girls to continually run the full length of the court.
They probably don't know that the first women's 1,500-meter run in the Olympics didn't happen until 1972 because the men in charge thought anything more than 800 meters would be too strenuous. The Olympics didn't add a women's marathon until 1984.
And it's perfectly fine that most girls who now play sports wouldn't know those things. Because now they grow up with limitless athletic possibilities, and that's the way it should be.
Of course, there are many people – mostly men – who see Title IX as something that has reduced college athletic scholarship opportunities for men. When you've been getting 100 percent of something forever, it's obviously going to ruffle some feathers when you start getting less.
But while Title IX has undoubtedly had an adverse impact on some men's college sports — especially wrestling — men still have plenty of opportunities in plenty of sports. And Title IX has opened the doors for thousands of women to enjoy all of the benefits and life lessons that come from competing on a college athletic team.
The New York Times referred to Sandler as the "Godmother of Title IX." I don't know if she was a sports fan, but I hope she was. Here in Delaware, she would have loved watching Elena Delle Donne dominate on a basketball court. She would have loved watching Daija Lampkin explode out of a starting block. She would have loved watching Phoebe Brinker crush a golf ball.
I hope she enjoyed some of the amazing feats that have been accomplished by female athletes since her hard work started to give them equal opportunities.
And I hope we all take a little time to remember Bernice Sandler, one of the people who made all of these things possible.

Sarah Sanders condemns Steve King's remarks as 'abhorrent'

Texto completo: White House press secretary Sarah Sanders on Wednesday denounced comments by Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, that many have deemed racist, calling them “abhorrent.”

“Steve King’s comments were abhorrent, and the Republican leadership, unlike Democrats, have actually taken action when their members have said outrageous and inappropriate things,” Sanders told reporters.

King has come under scrutiny from Republicans and Democrats alike for comments he made to the New York Times that indicated support for white nationalism and white supremacy.

“White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?” King told the New York Times. “Why did I sit in classes teaching me about the merits of our history and our civilization?”

The Republican congressman’s remarks were immediately criticized, and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said Monday that King would be stripped of his committee assignments this Congress, which include seats on the House Judiciary, Agriculture, and Small Business committees.

Other Republicans, such as Republican Conference Chairwoman Liz Cheney, R-Wyo. have suggested King should resign.

On Tuesday, the House overwhelmingly approved a resolution by a 424-1 vote that broadly rejected white nationalism and white supremacy and cited King’s remarks specifically. Only Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ill., voted against the resolution, as he felt it did not go far enough.

“Anything short of censure is shallow,” Rush said Tuesday. “Steve King has made a career of making racist statements. That is the only thing he is known for and this pattern of rabid racism must be confronted head on by the House of Representatives.”

King voted for the resolution and said in a speech on the House floor before the vote that the New York Times misinterpreted his comments, though he lamented that there is no recording of his discussion with the newspaper.

“I understand how you interpreted my words when you read them this way,” King said. “There is no tape for this interview that I did. … That ideology never shows up in my head. I don’t know how it could possibly come out of my mouth.”

Sanders, speaking to reporters at the White House, called the actions of GOP leader in response to King’s comments “very strong and rightful.”

Texto completo: In "A Dog's Way Home," Bryce Dallas Howard provides the voice of Bella, a brown-and-tan mixed breed who becomes separated from her human family.
In a promo for the film, Shelby -- the dog's real name -- can be seen snuggling happily with Howard. "She was found in a junkyard and hadn't encountered people, as far as anyone could tell," said Howard. "She was just a total sweetheart and was brought to a shelter," where she was ultimately selected by a trainer for the film.
Having worked on movies like "Jurassic World," where much of the challenge is acting opposite something that's not really there, Howard said doing voiceover was easy by comparison. "The film was already shot and edited and I recorded the voiceover afterwards, which was so fun because I got to see the movie and experience what the audience is going to see, and then I got to add a layer to it. Typically you're so inside of it, you don't get a sense of the big picture until you're at the premiere."
When asked about a worst moment in her career, she recalled a story from early in her career. "There was one super-defining moment for me and it was when I had left NYU," she said. "I hadn't graduated but I had started doing theater."
My worst moment ... "I did a couple shows at Manhattan Theatre Club and then I did something off-Broadway. And then I was doing Shakespeare's 'As You Like It' at the Public Theater and I was playing Rosalind. This was in 2003 and it was a production that had been put on before at another theater, so the entire cast had been brought back -- except for Rosalind. The woman who had previously played the role booked a TV pilot very suddenly and had to leave.
"So I was hired a week-and-a-half before previews started. There are usually three weeks of rehearsals at least, I think. So I had half that.
"Now, Rosalind has more lines than any other female character in Shakespeare. And I'm this 20- or 21-year-old girl who has a week-and-a-half to get off-book and be able to really inhabit the role. So it was certainly a challenge. I had an amazing director and an awesome cast, but I didn't feel like I was living up to the standards they were used to. It wasn't even insecurity. It was just a fact that every day I was like: Oh my gosh, I'm just not there yet.
"So we finally get to opening night and that's when all the reviewers were coming. We do the performance and you kind of know when you're not awesome yet (laughs), you can just tell. I was giving it my best, but it wasn't good enough. I have a good sense of when I'm (garbage), you know? (Laughs.)
"So the next morning I woke up and I opened The New York Times and I proceeded to read the review and it basically said this production is wonderful, beautifully directed, masterfully acted -- but it's a shame about the Rosalind. (Laughs.) And this was literally the first thing where I was carrying a show and having my performance assessed. And it was an accurate assessment! Not trying to be cruel at all. Like, really a legit critique.
(The review noted that while Howard was a "fetching temptress" in the role, she had a "tendency to overact. All too often you are conscious that she is making a face, as if the lines and gesture were memorized together.")
"I remember reading this, and you start to sweat, you start to panic, you're like, 'Oh, (shoot).' But then I remember being like: 'Huh. I'm OK.' Because I instantly recognized that it was true. I was like, 'I'm going to walk this off,' and I started to walk to the theater and by the time I got there, I literally had a pep in my step.
"And I just started to feel this freedom after that. Things started clicking and it started working. And a week after that review, M. Night Shyamalan came to see the show and afterwards he and his family waited for me. He was like, 'We loved the show, I just wanted to introduce myself.'
"A few weeks later, after the show had closed, I got a call from my agent, who said: 'M. Night Shyamalan wants to sit down and talk with you about a role in one of his movies.' So I went to lunch with Night and he was like, 'I don't know how to say this' -- and then he pulled out a manila envelope with a script and he pushed it over to me -- 'but I want you to be the lead in my next movie.' And he said, 'Just take the script, read it and give me a call.' And I went and I read it, and it was 'The Village' (from 2004) and that was my first movie. It was obviously a game-changing opportunity for me.
"And what followed that movie was a Lars von Trier movie called 'Manderlay' (2005) and I got that job because one of the other actors, who was very close with the producer of that film, had seen me in 'As You Like It' a week after opening and recommended me.
"My third job was doing Kenneth Branagh's 'As You Like It' (2006) as Rosalind. Why? Someone had seen me do it on (laughs) on stage a week after opening and recommended me! So I got to play Rosalind, again, in a movie with Ken Branagh directing me. And when that came out, I got nominated for a Golden Globe.
"Is there anything more encouraging than the fact that my first three major film jobs came directly from a performance that was given a week after being absolutely panned by The New York Times accurately? It was just this incredible payoff from this one experience. Work the problem, you're going to have a (junk) sandwich at the start, but that doesn't mean anything unless you give up."
Did being the daughter of a well-known director (Ron Howard) raise the stakes in terms of expectations? "I really, really, really need to get over this but I'm almost 38 and I don't think I will: I just really want to make my parents proud. And they are super proud, so it's a ridiculous thing, it's like chasing my own tail, you know? But I also feel this thing of: I just want to do well.
"My biggest thing was, I knew that I was in a privileged situation. Being the daughter of someone who has had success in my chosen industry, has celebrity, has a good reputation -- it was something that I knew was rare and I didn't want to fumble-bumble that. Sometimes people ask if I think it was an advantage or disadvantage and I'm always like, oh my gosh, are you kidding me? It was a total advantage. It's about getting in the door and so few people get a chance to walk through that door. I just didn't want to mess that up."
The takeaway ... "As a young actor, getting a bad review in The New York Times, that's one of your nightmares, and in this case it was like being found out. You've been caught and you just have to surrender to the situation that you're in and take responsibility. But it was super freeing because the worst-case scenario happened and I got through it.
"When I look back and remember the distress I felt of not being at the level that's being asked of you, that was very painful. But seeing that I could be reviewed (badly) and that I could turn it around so quickly was was so comforting. I wasn't living in that fear anymore.
"All of this stuff initially had to do with wanting to 'make it.' Being like, oh gosh, what's the consequence of this kind of public feedback? But when you're thinking about mastery rather than a career -- because a career has to do with money and how you support yourself -- but this was about my artistic development, looking at that and being like, yeah of course I'm not there yet. So what am I going to do to get there? You take the feedback and you keep practicing.
"It was definitely intensely embarrassing, but ultimately encouraging and kind of like divine intervention. It took some time and a big old paradigm-shifting event to get me to that next level. This was also not just about getting out of my own way, it was about practice and the expertise of those around me and the honesty of my friends and the candor. And specificity of that review, because there was actual feedback and concrete insights I could apply."

Texto completo: Illustration Michael Gerson Washington Post

WASHINGTON — What happens when immense bigotry gets lodged in a small mind? Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, is what happens.
In a recent interview with The New York Times, King asked, "White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?" It is a question that could only be posed by a bigot. And because it was a rhetorical question, King was assuming that all the rest of us — all right-thinking people — are bigots as well. Shouldn't the tie between whiteness and civilization be obvious?
As a reminder, white nationalism and supremacy — the ideology shared by Jefferson Davis, Bull Connor and, evidently, Steve King — became offensive because of centuries of stolen labor, murder and cruel abuse; because of a bloody war that one side conducted on behalf of slavery; because of repeating waves of anti-immigrant prejudice, alarmism and discrimination; because of routine lynchings and the stinging viciousness of segregation; because of the assumption that robbed, exploited and oppressed people somehow deserve social challenges resulting from robbery, exploitation and oppression.
For King, this was not a slip of the tongue, but the development of a theme. "We can't restore our civilization with somebody else's babies," King has argued. Those babies eventually grow up to be, in King's words, migrant kids with "calves the size of cantaloupes because they're hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert." This is threatening because "diversity is not our strength." In fact, it is "cultural suicide by demographic transformation." And King blames all of this on a conspiracy led by one, Semitic force: George Soros, whose money "floats in in such a way you can't see the flow."
King has pioneered a politics of resentment for demographic change and animus for outsiders. He feeds ethnic stereotypes and conspiracy theories. He issues apocalyptic warnings: "Europe is waking up. ... Will America ... in time?" And his local supporters dismiss criticism of King as "a personality thing."
Many elected Republicans in Washington have been forthright in their criticism of King after his latest offense. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy called King's remarks "reckless" and "wrong." Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., said King's argument was "abhorrent and racist." To Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, it was "offensive and racist." To Rep. Justin Amash, R-Mich., it was "an embrace of racism."
McCarthy has taken the welcome step of removing King from his committee assignments. Censure by the House is the next logical move, if Republicans are serious about scrubbing the stain King has left on their party.
In their criticism of King, you get the sense that Republicans are actually relieved to be in the position of attacking racism for a change, instead of being forced to defend it from the president. They seem to be signaling that they are not really the bigots that they appear to be. Republicans seem desperate to explain that they are normal and moral, in spite of all the evidence. Attacking King reveals some sense of shame at what they have become.
Yet, in the end, Republican critics of King manage to look worse rather than better. If racism is the problem, then President Trump is a worse offender. And their relative silence on Trump is a sign of hypocrisy and weakness.
Take the last days before the 2018 midterm elections. Trump closed his campaign for Republicans with a hysterical warning that brown people were invading the country. He initially suggested they should be shot. He added that he "wouldn't be surprised" if Soros was funding the migrant caravan. This is clearly what he regards as his strongest political argument — the racist promotion of animus against outsiders, tied to pernicious conspiracy theories.
Trump feeds ethnic stereotypes of migrants as "rapists" and "murderers." He makes apocalyptic warnings that Democratic control would "turn America into Venezuela" and "totally open borders." And his supporters dismiss criticism against him as a personality thing.
Add to this Trump's attribution of Kenyan citizenship to Barack Obama. And his sympathy for the "very fine people" attending a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville. And his attacks on African-American athletes and other figures. And his pardoning of former Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for racial profiling, terror raids and cruel punishment of inmates. And his attempts at a Muslim ban. And his contempt for "sh**hole countries." And ... a list far longer than I can include.
By any standard, Trump says things that are reckless, wrong, abhorrent, offensive and racist. And until Republicans can state this reality with the same clarity and intensity that they now criticize King, they will be cowards in a time crying for bravery.

Successful Aging: Maintaining a positive outlook helps in recovery and good health

Texto completo: I am a 78-year old healthy woman facing a fourth surgery on my leg and am a bit depressed. Fortunately, I’ve recovered well from the previous three. Up until now I have been very active, hiking, traveling, dancing and continuing to work in my career. Several friends who have had recent surgeries tell me I need to get used to doing less and that’s just what I should expect given my age. Their negative outlook is distressing to me. Can you offer a little hope? T.S.
Dear T.S.
Yes, hope is on its way. Let’s look at the reality. We know with age we will experience changes at some point in time. Some might be disease related, others more mechanical such as a joint replacement. We may need more sleep and slow down a bit. Our immune system may not be as efficient. And then there are changes in our vision and hearing. Add to that the loss of muscle mass and flexibility. Many of these normal changes can be postponed with healthy lifestyles.
And part of that healthy lifestyle is our attitude. Here is what we know:
Becca Levy and colleagues from Yale found that those who are optimistic about their age and reject aging stereotypes can extend their life by 7.5 years. This powerful finding takes into account age, gender, wealth and self-reported health and loneliness. This research is based on a study of 660 men and women in Ohio who were followed for over 20 years. Levy found the years they gained from having a positive attitude was more than the years gained from low blood pressure, maintaining a healthy weight, not smoking and regular exercise.
In today’s world, it can be difficult to maintain a positive view of aging as we live in a youth-centric society, particularly in Southern California. On our sunny days we are surrounded by sleek bodies in their beach, running and biking attire. In addition to our culture, preferences for youth over older age are evident in employment, movies, the advertising industry, marketing and more. But the times are slowly changing.
A recent New York Times story (January 9, 2019) headlined “Older and in Power, Unwilling to Remain Unseen” referred to four older women in positions of power: Susan Zirinksy at 66 will take over CBS News in March and is the first woman to do so. Then there is Nancy Pelosi who at 78 was re-elected to be Speaker of the House of Representatives. Representative Maxine Waters at 79 will lead the Financial Services Committee. And Glenn Close at 71 beat out four younger women to win the Golden Globe award for best actress.
Yes, these all are women, which makes their position noteworthy because in general age works against women a little bit more than it does for men. You’ve heard the expression – gray hair on a man is distinguished; on a woman it’s old age. Additionally, women confront two biases: age and gender.
Let’s continue to look at reality. Those who have an illness, particularly chronic ones, may have a hard time being optimistic. Illness is scary, forcing people to deal with uncertainty, lack of control and turning themselves over to doctors. For many there is a realization their life is finite. Being positive all of the time may be unrealistic.
Older adults are resilient. They have lived through wars, divorces, losing a job, relocating, financial concerns, illness and then spring back. Jonathan Rauch, author of “The Happiness Curve: Why Life Gets Better After 50” writes that older people feel less stress and regret; they dwell less on negative information and are better able to regulate their emotions. As a result, older adults are reported to be happier in their later years. Clearly difficult events continue to occur; it’s their response to the events that changes over time.
Although I am in no position to judge your current situation, it sounds as though your problem is likely fixable, given you have recovered well from your previous leg surgeries. Yet there is always uncertainty.
There is hope. Your ongoing positive outlook and resilience should serve you well. As to your friends, you might mention that everyone is a case of one – and in your case you are planning for a full recovery and resuming your active life. I feel confident that you will do everything possible to make that happen.

Texto completo: Author Katherine Applegate’s widely-praised "Wishtree" is the subject of this year’s Naperville READS campaign, the annual citywide reading celebration.
Naperville READS celebrates the idea that reading opens new worlds and exposes ideas in our hearts and minds.
Applegate, a Newbery Medalist and New York Times best-selling author, will be in Naperville at 7 p.m. Tuesday, Jan. 29, for an appearance at Naperville Central High School, 440 W. Aurora Ave.
The event is free and open to the public. Tickets are available at NapervilleReads.brownpapertickets.com.
Copies of the book also are available for purchase on the Brown Paper tickets website or at the door.
In addition to the centerpiece program on Jan. 29, nearly 4,000 children will get a chance to meet Applegate during her visit as Naperville Unit District 203, Indian Prairie Unit District 204 and area private schools take part in targeted events.
Educators also are invited to an hourlong event with the author geared toward teachers at 5:30 p.m. Jan. 29 at Naperville Central. The event is free and open to all educators.
In recognition of the earnest wishes made in the selected Naperville READS book, a miniature "wishtree" is being installed at Anderson’s Bookshop, 123 W. Jefferson Ave. Readers and community members alike are welcome to visit the tree and write wishes to be tied to its branches.
Also part of the Naperville READS celebration will be "Reading in the Window," which invites volunteers to take a turn reading in the front store window of Anderson’s Bookshop. Sign up by calling (630) 355-2665.
Applegate’s novel is about an oak tree and a crow who help their neighbors embrace their differences.
"Trees can’t tell jokes, but they can certainly tell stories ..."
Red is an oak tree who is many rings old. He also is the neighborhood wishtree — people write their wishes on pieces of cloth and tie them to his branches. Along with a crow named Bongo and other animals who seek refuge in Red’s hollows, this wishtree watches over the neighborhood.
When a new family moves in, not everyone is welcoming, and Red’s experience as a wishtree is more important than ever. With a message of inclusion for dreamers and welcomers, this is a book for our lives and times.

Texto completo: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said U.S. Rep. Steve King should look for another job if the Iowa Republican can't understand why white supremacy is considered offensive.
McConnell on Monday denounced King, who has served in Congress since 2003, for controversial comments he made last week in a New York Times interview.
"Rep. King's statements are unwelcome and unworthy of his elected position," McConnell said. "If he doesn't understand why 'white supremacy' is offensive, he should find another line of work."
King's comments drew national outrage last week during a 56-minute interview with the New York Times.
"White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization – how did that language become offensive?" King said in the interview. "Why did I sit in classes teaching me about the merits of our history and our civilization?"
King later walked back his comments saying: "I want to make one thing abundantly clear: I reject those labels and the evil ideology that they define."
This isn't the first time McConnell has called out racist behavior.
Last fall, McConnell called out Everett Corley, a candidate for the Kentucky House, when he said white people "should maintain our people and our culture as much as anyone else." Corley also said he viewed McConnell's marriage to Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao as one of "companionship" more than "a statement about children."
"This racist behavior is completely despicable," McConnell told the Courier Journal in September. "Such backward views and hateful rhetoric must be given no corner in the Republican Party or anywhere in America."

Texto completo: What lessons can progressives take from our ballot-box wins last year? What can we do to build on these victories and produce more in this year's elections — and in 2020?
We must assess this broad strategy ourselves, for most of today's mainline political analysts focus solely on "candidate politics," but too much "focus on the candidate" ignores the bigger, more significant story in 2018: movement politics. Thus, the media reduce our nation's vital democratic exercise to comic-book buzzwords like "blue wave" and "red wall."
New York Times commentator Frank Bruni, for example, even consulted a Harvard professor of evolutionary psychology to develop his novel grasp of last year's voter behavior ("Politics aren't pretty. But politicians are," Nov. 20). Normally a smart guy, he veered off into the psycho-pop ditch, writing after the election that the meteoric rise of Andrew Gillum in Florida, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York and Beto O'Rourke in Texas was attributable to a political quality they share: They're "hot," the scribe explained.
Grassroots participants and some of us less prominent pundits would argue that in 2018, progressive forces prioritized a very different kind of political beauty: genuine democratic populism. Not just in the campaigns of the trio who "soared to fame," as Bruni glibly put it, but in the gritty campaigns of hundreds of national, state and local candidates who took on the odds, the establishment and decades of conventional wisdom to win, or come tantalizingly close. They and their millions of supporters have erected a framework for real change, based on such broadly attractive features as: candidates with authentic economic-social-political principles rather than poll-tested, consultant-designed "positions"; unabashedly progressive policies based not on the preferences of corporate donors but on concern for the Common Good; less arrogance, more humility, including a measure of recognition that the larger democratic movement is more important than any one ego.
This grassroots political movement has come a long way in a hurry. In recent decades, its seeds were planted and nurtured around the country by fair trade battles, Black Lives Matter, gay marriage successes, the Fight for $15, women's marches, climate change awakenings and so many other big struggles. But the movement only flowered into a nationwide political force in 2016, when much of it rallied around Bernie Sanders' overtly populist presidential run. While his campaign fell short of electoral victory, it showed that a movement of populist integrity could succeed in advancing progressive candidates, causes and policies.
Two years later, the political outsiders who fueled Sanders' campaign had dispersed into hundreds of upstart candidacies, creating the hardy patches of wildflower politics that blossomed in 2018.

Democrats will scold Steve King, but might not censure him

Texto completo: The House will vote Tuesday on a resolution disapproving of Rep. Steve King's comments to the New York Times that were deemed racist, but many Democrats are wary of going further by formally censuring him.

The disapproval resolution, authored by House Majority Whip James Clyburn, D-S.C., is backed by most in the Democratic caucus but does not go far enough for some in the party, who want to censure King. But that’s much more serious punishment that lawmakers, including many Democratic leaders, are seeking to avoid.

House Majority Whip Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said Tuesday he isn’t ruling out a vote on a censure resolution, but signaled it’s an option the party may not take.

“We’ll see,” said Hoyer, who backs the Clyburn resolution. “We haven’t definitely decided what the next step is going to be.”

Democrats’ zeal to punish King may be been blunted by Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., who on Monday stripped King of every one of his committee assignments. Such a move will hurt King’s re-election chances if he remains in Congress.

Lawmakers in the House and Senate rarely punish their own, and a censure resolution is considered a last-resort action against a sitting member.

The House last voted to censure a lawmaker in December 2010, when the GOP Majority, with the help of many Democrats, censured then-Rep. Charlie Rangel, D-N.Y., for “misuse of congressional letterhead for fundraising, impermissible use of rent-controlled facility for campaign headquarters and inaccurate financial reports and federal tax returns,” according to House records.

Prior to Rangel, House lawmakers hadn’t voted to censure a lawmaker since 1983 when they voted to censure Rep. Daniel Crane, R-Ill., for sexual misconduct with a House page.

A censure is considered one step down from a vote to expel a member and is rarely employed, in part because lawmakers fear partisan retaliation.

In this case, Hoyer acknowledged, punishing King for his statements that appeared to defend “white nationalism” and “white supremacy” could push Republicans to turn the tables and seek punishment for a few House Democrats who have associated themselves with figures such as Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan who has expressed anti-Semitic remarks.

The current decision to reprimand and not censure King has angered some Democrats who say King has a history of making racist statements. King has tried to clarify his remarks to the New York Times and said he was defending the term “western civilization” and not “white supremacy” or “white nationalism.”

Democrats were not mollified by King’s defense. Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ill., authored a censure resolution and wants Democratic leaders to bring it to the floor. He plans to vote against the resolution of disapproval.

“Anything short of censure is shallow,” Rush said Tuesday. “Steve King has made a career of making racist statements. That is the only thing he is known for and this pattern of rabid racism must be confronted head on by the House of Representatives.”

Rush said he plans to try to bring up the censure resolution under special House rules.

“Yesterday, the notice I provided of my privileged resolution to formally censure the member from Iowa, started the clock for a floor vote to punish him for his bigotry and racism,” Rush said Tuesday. “We need to be clear to the American people that we use condemnation to express our disapproval of those not in the House. We use censure for those in the House, Steve King is a sitting member.”

GOP should decry racism, no matter who is exhibiting it

Texto completo: What happens when immense bigotry gets lodged in a small mind? Rep. Steve King, Republican of Iowa, is what happens.
In a recent interview with The New York Times, King asked, "White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?" It is a question that could only be posed by a bigot. And because it was a rhetorical question, King was assuming that all the rest of us — all right-thinking people — are bigots as well. Shouldn’t the tie between whiteness and civilization be obvious?
As a reminder, white nationalism and supremacy — the ideology shared by Jefferson Davis, Bull Connor and, evidently, Steve King — became offensive because of centuries of stolen labor, murder and cruel abuse; because of a bloody war that one side conducted on behalf of slavery; because of repeating waves of anti-immigrant prejudice, alarmism and discrimination; because of routine lynchings and the stinging viciousness of segregation; because of the assumption that robbed, exploited and oppressed people somehow deserve social challenges resulting from robbery, exploitation and oppression.
For King, this was not a slip of the tongue, but the development of a theme. "We can’t restore our civilization with somebody else’s babies," King has argued. Those babies eventually grow up to be, in King’s words, migrant kids with "calves the size of cantaloupes because they’re hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert." This is threatening because "diversity is not our strength." In fact, it is "cultural suicide by demographic transformation."
Many elected Republicans in Washington have been forthright in their criticism of King after his latest offense. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy called King’s remarks "reckless" and "wrong." Rep. Liz Cheney, of Wyoming, said King’s argument was "abhorrent and racist." To Sen. Joni Ernst, of Iowa, it was "offensive and racist." To Rep. Justin Amash, of Michigan, it was "an embrace of racism."
McCarthy has (vaguely) promised that disciplinary "action will be taken." If King is not at least censured, it will mean the House has no standards at all. And this, unfortunately, would be no surprise at all.
In their criticism of King, you get the sense that Republicans are actually relieved to be in the position of attacking racism for a change, instead of being forced to defend it from the president. They seem to be signaling that they are not really the bigots that they appear to be. Republicans seem desperate to explain that they are normal and moral, in spite of all the evidence. Attacking King reveals some sense of shame at what they have become.
Yet, in the end, Republican critics of King manage to look worse rather than better. If racism is the problem, then President Donald Trump is a worse offender. And their relative silence on Trump is a sign of hypocrisy and weakness.
Take the last days before the 2018 midterm elections. Trump closed his campaign for Republicans with a hysterical warning that brown people were invading the country. He initially suggested they should be shot. He added that he "wouldn’t be surprised" if Soros was funding the migrant caravan. This is clearly what he regards as his strongest political argument — the racist promotion of animus against outsiders, tied to pernicious conspiracy theories.
Trump feeds ethnic stereotypes of migrants as "rapists" and "murderers." He makes apocalyptic warnings that Democratic control would "turn America into Venezuela" and "totally open borders." And his supporters dismiss criticism against him as a personality thing. Add to this Trump’s attribution of Kenyan citizenship to Barack Obama. And his sympathy for the "very fine people" attending a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville. And his attacks on African-American athletes and other figures. And his pardoning of former Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for racial profiling, terror raids and cruel punishment of inmates. And his attempts at a Muslim ban. And his contempt for "(expletive) countries." And ... a list far longer than I can include.
By any standard, Trump says things that are reckless, wrong, abhorrent, offensive and racist. And until Republicans can state this reality with the same clarity and intensity that they now criticize King, they will be cowards in a time crying for bravery.

Trump denies ever working for Russia

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump on Monday denied he ever worked for Russia against U.S. interests, addressing an extraordinary question that has haunted his presidency and shows no sign of going away.

Speaking from the South Lawn, Trump issued a flat denial: "I never worked for Russia." He blasted former FBI and Justice Department officials and repeated his claim that the investigation into his ties to Moscow is a hoax.

Trump raised eyebrows over the weekend when he didn't directly answer the Russia question in an interview with Fox News host Jeanine Pirro, a personal friend.

He was asked about a New York Times report that law enforcement officials began investigating, in 2017, whether Trump had been working on behalf of Russia against U.S. interests.

Trump said the question was "insulting," but did not directly deny it.

Monday's clear denial demonstrated the unprecedented pressure Trump faces as the special counsel's Russia investigation shows possible signs of wrapping up. After two years in office, the president is still being questioned about whether he was compromised by Russian intelligence agencies and he is still struggling to answer clearly.

White House aides expressed regret over the weekend that the president did not more clearly and forcefully deny being a Russian agent on Saturday when asked by the usually friendly Fox News host, according to three White House aides and Republicans close to the White House. The three spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss private conversations.

When Pirro asked if he had ever worked for Russia, Trump said it was "the most insulting thing I've ever been asked."

"I think it's the most insulting article I've ever had written, and if you read the article you'll see that they found absolutely nothing," he said.

Trump went on to assert that no president has taken a harder stance against Russia than he has.

"If you ask the folks in Russia, I've been tougher on Russia than anybody else, any other ... probably any other president, period, but certainly the last three or four presidents," he said.

On Monday, Trump also defended his decision to fire FBI Director James Comey, a move that has drawn Mueller's scrutiny. Trump called the Russia probe "a whole big fat hoax."

Texto completo: Republican Rep. Steve King of Iowa has been stripped of committee assignments following racist comments he made to The New York Times in a report published last week, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy announced Monday.
Mr. McCarthy announced that the House Republican Steering Committee, which oversees committee assignments, met Monday night and made a decision that Mr. King "will not be serving on committees in this Congress."
Earlier Monday, a pair of the Senate's most high-profile Republicans on Monday sharply condemned Mr. King, the highest ranking GOP officials to publicly rebuke Mr. King after comments he made that were seen as sympathetic to white supremacists.
The criticism from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Utah freshman Sen. Mitt Romney comes as the House plans to vote as soon as Tuesday on a resolution to disapprove of the actions of Mr. King, who has a history of making incendiary comments related to race and immigration.
"There is no place in the Republican Party, the Congress or the country for an ideology of racial supremacy of any kind," Mr. McConnell said in a statement released from his office. "I have no tolerance for such positions and those who espouse these views are not supporters of American ideals and freedoms. Rep. King's statements are unwelcome and unworthy of his elected position."
Mr. McConnell added, "If he doesn't understand why 'white supremacy' is offensive, he should find another line of work."
Mr. Romney told CNN that Mr. King should "step aside."
In an interview with the Times in a story published last week, Mr. King asked, "White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization - how did that language become offensive?"
The comments caused widespread outrage, including from many members of his own party. Several high profile lawmakers called for Mr. King to be stripped of his committee assignments.
The House will vote as soon as Tuesday on the resolution to disapprove of Mr. King, Democratic sources told CNN. The resolution being proposed by South Carolina Rep. James Clyburn, the No. 3 member of Democratic House leadership and the highest ranking African American member of Congress. The resolution, however, is not as severe as a censure resolution that other Democrats -like Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio and Bobby Rush of Illinois -are proposing.
Mr. King met Monday afternoon with Mr. McCarthy of California. Mr. McCarthy, the top Republican in the chamber, said over the weekend that Mr. King's language has "no place in America" and that "action will be taken."
"That is not the America I know, and it is most definitely not the party of Lincoln," Mr. McCarthy told CBS's "Face the Nation" on Sunday. "I have a scheduled meeting with him on Monday, and I will tell you this: I've watched on the other side that they do not take action when their members say something like this. Action will be taken. I'm having a serious conversation with Congressman Steve King on his future and role in this Republican Party."

Texto completo: Carleton S. Coon Jr., a career Foreign Service officer who balanced professional and family diplomacy as ambassador to Nepal while his wife served as ambassador to nearby Bangladesh, died Dec. 3 at a hospital in Warrenton, Va. He was 91.
The cause was biliary sepsis, said his wife, Jane Abell Coon, who also was a career Foreign Service officer.
For three years beginning in 1981, Mr. Coon and his wife served respectively in Kathmandu and Dhaka. "Can a good marriage withstand having two ambassadors in the family?" the New York Times facetiously asked in a 1981 story on the Coons' appointments.
"Yes, it thrived," said Mr. Coon's daughter Ellen Coon. "They celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary last year."
In deference to State Department traditions for female Foreign Service officers, Jane Abell Coon retired after 17 years in the government when she married Mr. Coon, a widowed father of six, in 1968. It was a tradition that did not apply to male Foreign Service officers.
However, the protocol already had been breached at least once. In 1967, Carol Laise, then the ambassador to Nepal, married Ellsworth Bunker, an ambassador at large who later became ambassador to South Vietnam. At their wedding in Nepal, they received a congratulatory telegram from President Lyndon B. Johnson, which would have made it exceedingly difficult for a State Department bureaucrat to have insisted that Carol Laise Bunker leave the Foreign Service.
For nine years, Jane Coon helped raise her stepchildren. The experience, she said, "had its moments." Resuming her professional life in 1976 after the State Department became less hostile to the idea of dual diplomatic spouses, she was a deputy assistant secretary before her appointment as ambassador to Bangladesh.
As ambassadors, the Coons were only 90 minutes apart by airplane. "That's better than you can do between New York and Washington," Mrs. Coon told People magazine at the time.
They visited each other regularly. Children came over for Christmas. There were exploratory family treks in the Nepali mountains.
"The way we live these days is an abnormal way to run a marriage," Mr. Coon told People, "but now at least when I see her, I see her. . . . After all, it's nice to be an ambassador after 30 years of understudying the role."
Carlton Coon retired from the Foreign Service in 1985, and his wife retired the next year.
Carleton Stevens Coon Jr. was born in Paris on April 27, 1927. His father, a celebrated anthropologist, was on an expedition in Morocco at the time. The younger Coon graduated from the private Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., served in the Army at the end of World War II and graduated from Harvard in 1949.
After joining Foreign Service that same year, he went on to serve in Germany, Syria, India, Iran and Morocco. As director of North African affairs, he had oversight of U.S. relations with the Libyan strongman Moammar Gaddafi.
His first wife, Janet Wulsin, died in 1967. Their son William P. Coon died in 1996.
In addition to Jane Coon of Woodville, Va., survivors include his five children, Howard W. Coon of Castleton, Va., Katharine A. Coon of Takoma Park, Md., Ellen J. Coon of New York, and Elizabeth Gaskill and Richard G. Coon, both of Chico, Calif.; 13 grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren.

Texto completo: Sen. Bernie Sanders will meet with former staffers this week to discuss sexual harassment and gender discrimination allegedly experienced during his 2016 presidential campaign, according to a report.

The meeting, scheduled for Wednesday, comes after a group of former male and female aides requested the sit-down via a letter describing the "predatory culture" of the independent Vermont senator's campaign for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination in 2016.

Buzzfeed reported Monday that Sanders paid for the attendees to come to Washington through his campaign account. The discussion will be facilitated by two Working IDEAL consultants, a firm that helps clients improve their workplace environments.

According to the letter, first reported this month by Politico, the aim of the meeting is to draft "concrete" polices and procedures to avoid similar complaints arising if Sanders announces a second run for the White House. The group also want to secure a commitment from Sanders and his top advisers that they will hire a more diverse leadership team should the senator mount a 2020 bid.

While the letter did not lay out specific accusations, Politico and the New York Times later reported stories from women who recounted misconduct by senior staff and surrogates, as well as instances of pay inequity.

In a January interview with CNN, Sanders apologized "to any woman who felt that she was not treated appropriately," saying he was unaware of the allegations at the time and vowing to "do better" should he vie for the country's top job again.

Judge blocks Trump birth control rules A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's loosened birth control rules from going into effect in 13 states and the District of Columbia on Monday as scheduled. The Department of Health and Human Services created rules allowing employers to opt out of birth control coverage due to religious or moral objections. Employers otherwise have to offer health insurance that covers a range of birth control options, from the pill to intrauterine devices to emergency contraception, at no cost to patients. The decision to block the rules from taking effect was issued Sunday by Judge Haywood Gilliam, who was nominated by former President Barack Obama and previously blocked an interim version of the exemptions. The decision in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California was issued Sunday in response to a lawsuit filed by Democratic attorneys general. The injunction only applies to D.C. and the 13 states that filed the lawsuit, even though the attorneys general had asked for the injunction to be applied nationwide.

5th Circuit pauses Obamacare case due to government shutdown. A federal appeals court granted the Department of Justice's request to pause a case that could undo Obamacare as the government's partial shutdown headed.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit in New Orleans on Friday temporarily paused the case, Texas v. U.S., following a DOJ request that came earlier this week. Assistant Attorney General Jody Hunt told the court that DOJ lawyers “are unable to prepare their opposition at this time due to the lapse in appropriations.” The government's partial shutdown is over a disagreement between President Trump and Democrats over how to fund border security, with Trump demanding $5.7 billion to fund a barrier on the U.S.-Mexico border. The latest order on holding the Obamacare lawsuit was signed by Judge Leslie Southwick, a George W. Bush appointee. A federal judge in December ruled that the healthcare law was unconstitutional and the ruling is being stayed as Democratic attorneys general appeal the case.


Seven million sickened as flu season worsens. Flu season has picked up in recent weeks, and officials estimate that between 6.2 and 7.3 million people have gotten sick since October, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Friday. The agency's data, which encompasses Oct. 1, 2018 to Jan. 5, 2019, shows half of those who got sick went to see the doctor, and that between 69,300 to 83,500 people have been hospitalized. Officials are still evaluating how severe this year's flu season will be compared to other years'. It was off to a slow start but has accelerated in recent weeks, with local reports of deaths. Roughly 200,000 people are hospitalized on average with the flu every year, and the season can last as late as May.


Democrats raise concerns about FDA food inspections under shutdown. Thirty-four Democratic senators sent a letter to the Food and Drug Administration last week requesting information on how the agency was reducing oversight of food facilities, how the approval of medical devices might be hindered, and whether the agency is taking steps to address financial issues furloughed employees face. “While we appreciate the efforts of the agency and the tireless work of your staff to help mitigate the impact of the shutdown on the public health, we remain deeply concerned about the halt of vital regulatory and compliance activities at FDA,” they wrote.


Anti-abortion polling finds support for abortion limits among Millennials. A poll from Students for Life of America’s Institute for Pro-Life Advancement found that only 7 percent of those polled supported both allowing abortion without any exceptions and using government funding to pay for them. People identifying as “pro-life” and “pro-choice” were equally divided, at 39 percent, but 17 percent supported abortion without exceptions while 12 percent said abortion should be illegal in all cases. Twenty-eight percent of those polled support limits through policies such as parental notification, 20-week bans, and opposing government funding of abortion. Other polling has found that roughly two-thirds of the public doesn’t want to overturn Roe v. Wade , but when the Students for Life poll asked respondents about returning the question of the legality of abortion to the states, 41 percent said they would support that while 33 percent opposed. The rest were undecided. The poll was conducted in the first week of January by the Polling Company, Inc./WomanTrend among 18-34 year olds.


UK doctors to be polled on medically assisted suicide. The Royal College of Physicians, the UK’s doctor group, will be polling its 35,000 members and fellows next month about whether they think the laws should change on medically assisted suicide, and whether they would be willing to participate in the practice if it did become legal. Under current law, passed in 1961, medically assisted suicide is illegal and doctors could face up to 14 years in jail if they take part in it. The Royal College of physicians is taking a neutral stance on the issue for now but will reconsider if at least two-thirds are for or against the practice.


Ginsburg shows no remaining signs of cancer, Supreme Court says. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's recovery from cancer surgery is “on track,” though she will remain off the bench for the second week in a row, the Supreme Court said Friday. “Justice Ginsburg will continue to work from home next week and will participate in the consideration and decision of the cases on the basis of the briefs and the transcripts of oral arguments,” Supreme Court spokeswoman Kathy Arberg said in a statement. Arberg said that Ginsburg’s post-surgery evaluation showed no signs of remaining cancer and that no additional treatment is needed. Ginsburg underwent surgery Dec. 21 to remove two cancerous nodules from her left lung. She was discharged from the hospital on Christmas Day and has since been recuperating at home.

Texto completo: The second celebrity edition of "Big Brother" premieres next Monday with two Long Islanders vying for the $250,000 prize: Dina Lohan, of Merrick, and Anthony Scaramucci, originally from Port Washington and now living in Manhasset.
The two are among the dozen celebrity houseguests CBS announced Sunday, with the remainder comprised of actors/TV personalities Jonathan Bennett, 37, Joey Lawrence, 42, and Kato Kaelin, 59; singers/TV personalities Tamar Braxton, 41, and Kandi Burruss, 42; comedian Tom Green, 47; former NFL star Ricky Williams, 41; 12-time Olympic medalist in swimming Ryan Lochte, 34; Olympic track and bobsled star Lolo Jones, 36; and former WWE wrestler Natalie Eva Marie, 34.
Lohan, 56, the mother of actress-entrepreneur Lindsay Lohan, serves as personal manager to her singer-actress daughter Ali Lohan and to her son Dakota Lohan, a model. All three starred in the 2008 E! behind-the-scenes reality show "Living Lohan." On Sunday, Dina Lohan tweeted a short promo clip for "Big Brother" and wrote, "So this is happening....."
The tart-tongued Scaramucci, 55, a Wall Street financier who served for 10 days as White House communications director in mid-July 2017 before being fired by Chief of Staff John Kelly, had been a Newsday newsboy growing up. A Harvard Law School classmate of President Barack Obama, he was described by The New York Times in 2013 as "Wall Street's first hedge fund impresario, a P.T. Barnum in a Ferragamo tie."
Hosted by Julie Chen Moonves -- the former co-anchor of CBS' the "The Early Show" and former co-host of "The Talk," who recently began using the last name of her husband, former CBS Corp. chairman and CEO Les Moonves -- this abbreviated season of "Big Brother" will have a two-night premiere next Monday and Tuesday, and air for three weeks, with a two-hour finale on Wednesday, Feb. 13.

Texto completo: Rep. Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, said the New York Times' bombshell report on a counterintelligence investigation into President Trump's ties to Russia only strengthens the argument that the FBI has no evidence of collusion against the Trump team.

"This is yet more evidence that FBI leaders actually had no real evidence against the Trump team," Nunes said in a statement obtained by the Washington Examiner's Byron York. "Instead, they were simply trying to undermine a president they didn't like and avenge Comey's firing. By relying on the Steele dossier -- a fraudulent document funded by Democrats and based on Russia sources -- FBI leaders were either complicit or too oblivious to notice they were being used in a disinformation operation by the Democratic Party and Russian operatives."

On Friday, the New York Times reported the FBI had opened a counterintelligence investigation into Trump the day after he fired FBI Director James Comey in the spring of 2017. The counterintelligence inquiry was later wrapped into the FBI's broader Russia collusion investigation, which special counsel Robert Mueller was appointed to lead after Comey's ouster. That inquiry is still ongoing.

In a follow-up, the Washington Post reported the president took steps to try to protect his conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin, including pressuring a translator to withhold information on discussions between the two leaders from administration officials.

White House press secretary Sarah Sanders has called the Times report "absurd" and when he was asked about whether he has ever worked for the Russians during an interview with Fox News' Jeanine Pirro late Saturday, Trump said it was "the most insulting thing I’ve ever been asked."

Similar to Nunes, Trump also argued on Twitter that the Times story showed "the corrupt former leaders of the FBI, almost all fired or forced to leave the agency for some very bad reasons, opened up an investigation on me, for no reason & with no proof, after I fired Lyin’ James Comey, a total sleaze!"

Nunes' brief comment on the Times report is his first big major public statement he's made since abdicating the chairmanship of the House Intelligence Committee to Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who is a vocal critic of Trump. As chairman Nunes led the committee's investigation into Russian meddling, which ultimately found no evidence of collusion. Schiff and his fellow Democrats complained that the inquiry ended prematurely and with a new majority in the lower chamber Trump is in their cross hairs on a number of fronts, including the Russia question.

In his own statement reacting to the Times report, Schiff said, "The House Intelligence Committee has a responsibility to the American people to ensure that the President is working in our national interest and is not motivated by any other factor, and we are pressing forward with that work."

Although Schiff and his Democratic counterparts have been quick to raise the alarm, they have neglected to to comment on whether they had been briefed by federal officials about the reported counterintelligence operation.

Texto completo: Today is Sunday, Jan. 13, the 13th day of 2019. There are 352 days left in the year.
Today’s Highlight in History:
On Jan. 13, 1982, an Air Florida 737 crashed into Washington, D.C.’s 14th Street Bridge and fell into the Potomac River while trying to take off during a snowstorm, killing a total of 78 people; four passengers and a flight attendant survived.
On this date:
In 1794, President George Washington approved a measure adding two stars and two stripes to the American flag, following the admission of Vermont and Kentucky to the Union. (The number of stripes was later reduced to the original 13.)
In 1915, a magnitude-7 earthquake centered in Avezzano, Italy, claimed some 30,000 lives.
In 1941, a new law went into effect granting Puerto Ricans U.S. birthright citizenship. Novelist and poet James Joyce died in Zurich, Switzerland, less than a month before his 59th birthday.
In 1962, comedian Ernie Kovacs died in a car crash in west Los Angeles 10 days before his 43rd birthday.
In 1964, Roman Catholic Bishop Karol Wojtyla (the future Pope John Paul II) was appointed Archbishop of Krakow, Poland, by Pope Paul VI.
In 1968, country singer Johnny Cash performed and recorded a pair of shows at Folsom State Prison in California; material from the concerts was released as an album by Columbia Records under the title “Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison,” which proved a hit.
In 1978, former Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey died in Waverly, Minnesota, at age 66.
In 1990, L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia became the nation’s first elected black governor as he took the oath of office in Richmond.
In 1992, Japan apologized for forcing tens of thousands of Korean women to serve as sex slaves for its soldiers during World War II, citing newly uncovered documents that showed the Japanese army had had a role in abducting the so-called “comfort women.”
In 1997, seven black soldiers were awarded the Medal of Honor for World War II valor; the lone survivor of the group, former Lt. Vernon Baker, received his medal from President Bill Clinton at the White House.
In 2000, Microsoft chairman Bill Gates stepped aside as chief executive and promoted company president Steve Ballmer to the position.
In 2012, the Italian luxury liner Costa Concordia ran aground off the Tuscan island of Giglio and flipped onto its side; 32 people were killed.
Ten years ago: President-elect Barack Obama’s nominee for secretary of state, Hillary Rodham Clinton, vowed during her Senate confirmation hearing to revitalize the mission of diplomacy in U.S. foreign policy. Obama’s choice to run the Treasury Department, Timothy Geithner, disclosed that he had failed to pay $34,000 in taxes from 2001 to 2004. U.S. Marshals apprehended Marcus Schrenker, 38, in North Florida days after the businessman and amateur daredevil pilot apparently tried to fake his own death in a plane crash. (Schrenker was sentenced to 10 years in prison after pleading guilty to securities fraud charges, on top of four years in federal prison on charges stemming from the plane crash.)
Actor-director Patrick McGoohan died in Los Angeles at age 80. Author Hortense Calisher died in New York at age 97.
Five years ago: A shooting at a Wesley Chapel, Florida, movie theater left Chad Oulson, 43, dead; retired Tampa police captain Curtis Reeves, 71, is accused of killing Oulson during what authorities said was an argument over Oulson’s texting just before a showing of the movie “Lone Survivor.” (He is still awaiting trial; a judge has rejected a “stand-your-ground” defense.) Two Fullerton, California, police officers who were videotaped in a violent struggle with a homeless man, Kelly Thomas, during an arrest were acquitted by a jury in Santa Ana of killing him.
One year ago: A false alarm that warned of a ballistic missile headed for Hawaii sent the islands into a panic, with people abandoning cars on a highway and preparing to flee their homes; officials apologized and said the alert was sent when someone hit the wrong button during a shift change. Two Army captains who met at West Point, Daniel Hall and Vincent Franchino, returned there to be married, in what The New York Times said was believed to be the first same-sex marriage of active-duty personnel at the military academy.

Texto completo: "He was a Crooked Cop who is being totally protected
by his best friend, Bob Mueller, & the 13 Angry Democrats..."
President Donald Trump, on James Comey
President Donald Trump, in response to reports that the FBI began an investigation of him last year to find out whether he had a clandestine agenda to help Russia, said Saturday that former FBI Director James Comey and other "losers" at the bureau "tried to do a number on your President."
He called Comey a "total sleaze" and "crooked cop." The president also took swipes at special counsel Robert Mueller and T he New York Times, which broke the story Friday night. "My firing of James Comey was a great day for America," he tweeted.
Comey responded Saturday morning in a tweet that quoted President Franklin D. Roosevelt: "I ask you to judge me by the enemies I have made."
The newspaper said the decision to investigate Trump himself was an aggressive move by FBI officials confronting the chaotic aftermath of the firing of Comey and enduring the president's verbal assaults on the Russia investigation as a "witch hunt."
CNN reported that counterintelligence agents were investigating why Trump was acting in ways that seemed to benefit Russia.
Both news organizations said Trump's firing of Comey was a major factor prompting the FBI to take action.
Although the report was published Friday night and prompted a sharp response from White House press secretary Sarah Sanders, Trump did not weigh in until 7:05 a.m Saturday.
"Wow, just learned in the Failing New York Times that the corrupt former leaders of the FBI, almost all fired or forced to leave the agency for some very bad reasons, opened up an investigation on me, for no reason & with no proof, after I fired Lyin' James Comey, a total sleaze!
In a series of tweets, he said the FBI was in "complete turmoil" at the time because of Comey's "poor leadership" and his handling of an investigation of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.
"My firing of James Comey was a great day for America," Trump tweeted. "He was a Crooked Cop who is being totally protected by his best friend, Bob Mueller, & the 13 Angry Democrats..."
He singled out several FBI agents in his five-part tweetstorm.
"Lyin' James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter S and his lover, agent Lisa Page, & more, all disgraced and/or fired and caught in the act. These are just some of the losers that tried to do a number on your President," he tweeted. "Part of the Witch Hunt. Remember the 'insurance policy?' This is it!"
Trump was referring to charges that some FBI agents, among them McCabe, Peter Strzok and Page, a colleague Strzok was intimately involved with, were part of a conspiracy to undermine the president.
Addressing the Russia aspect of the Times report, Trump said he had been "FAR tougher on Russia than Obama, Bush or Clinton. Maybe tougher than any other President."
He repeated his long-held contention that "getting along with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing."
Sanders said in her statement Friday night that Comey was fired for just cause and that Trump has never favored Russia.
"This is absurd. James Comey was fired because he's a disgraced partisan hack, and his Deputy Andrew McCabe, who was in charge at the time, is a known liar fired by the FBI. Unlike President Obama, who let Russia and other foreign adversaries push America around, President Trump has actually been tough on Russia."
The obstruction probe was an idea the FBI had previously considered, but it didn't start until Comey was fired, CNN reported. The justification went beyond Trump's firing of Comey, CNN said, according to its sources, and included the president's conversation with Comey in the Oval Office asking him to drop the investigation into his former national security adviser Michael Flynn.
Trump insisted last year that he didn't fire Comey because of the Russia investigation, despite video and documentary evidence to the contrary, including an interview with NBC News.
"I was going to fire Comey knowing there was no good time to do it," he told NBC anchor Lester Holt. "And in fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself — I said, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story. It's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should've won."
"Not that it matters but I never fired James Comey because of Russia!" Trump tweeted shortly after the firing. "The Corrupt Mainstream Media loves to keep pushing that narrative, but they know it is not true!"
The FBI director's firing is central to an obstruction of justice investigation being conducted by Mueller, who is also looking into Russian attempts to influence the 2016 election ito help Trump.

Texto completo: Global warming isn't only cooking our atmosphere, it's also heating up the oceans.
The world's seas were the warmest on record in 2018, scientists announced last week. Also, ocean temperatures are rising faster than previously thought, a new paper said.
Specifically, they're warming as much as 40 percent faster than an estimate from a United Nations panel just five years ago.
"If you want to see where global warming is happening, look in our oceans," paper co-author Zeke Hausfather said in a statement. "Ocean heating is a very important indicator of climate change, and we have robust evidence that it is warming more rapidly than we thought," said Hausfather, a climate scientist with Carbon Brief, a British-based website that covers climate science news.
He also said that while 2018 was the fourth-warmest year on record in the atmosphere, it was the warmest year on record in the oceans, as was 2017 and 2016 before that. In fact, Hausfather told Reuters, records for ocean warming have been broken almost yearly since 2000.
Overall, while we're rightly concerned about what climate change is doing to our atmosphere, ocean heating is critical because an estimated 93 percent of all heat trapped by greenhouse gases settles in the world's oceans.
Global warming is caused by humanity's burning of fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal, which release greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane into the earth's atmosphere and oceans.
"Global warming is here, and has major consequences already. There is no doubt, none!" the paper's authors wrote.
The analysis also shows that trends in ocean heat content match those predicted by top computer models.
Laure Zanna, an associate professor of climate physics at the University of Oxford who was not involved in the study, told The New York Times that the research was "a very nice summary of what we know of the ocean and how far the new estimates have come together."
The unusual warmth in the seas is harming marine life and coral reefs. It's also contributing to rising sea levels around the world as ice melts near Antarctica and Greenland.
The research was published Thursday in a "Perspectives" paper in the peer-reviewed journal Science.
Ocean temperatures are rising faster than previously thought, with dire implications for coral reefs and other marine life.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump went to "extraordinary lengths" to keep details from his conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin secret – even from officials within his own administration, The Washington Post reported this weekend, citing unnamed sources.
After meeting with Putin at the 2017 Group of 20 summit in Hamburg, Germany, Trump took his interpreter's notes and told him not to discuss the meeting with anyone, including other U. S. officials, the Post reported.
The paper said Trump's handling of the Hamburg meeting was "part of a broader pattern by the president of shielding his communications with Putin from public scrutiny and preventing even high-ranking officials in his own administration from fully knowing what he has told one of the United States’ main adversaries. "
No detailed record exists from five of Trump's interactions with the Russian leader since taking office, the Post reported. It was unclear if that was the only time Trump took his interpreters' notes, but the paper said several administration officials have been unable to obtain a readout from his meeting last year with Putin in Helsinki.
New York Times: FBI investigated President Trump for possible secret Russian favors
Trump: NYT report on FBI fear that he worked for Russia is 'most insulting article' ever
Former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was present at the meeting in Hamburg. The Post said Tillerson did not answer questions about Trump asking the interpreter to keep details of the meeting quiet, or if Trump took the interpreter's notes.
Fiona Hill, a senior Russia adviser on the National Security Council, and former State Department official John Heffern asked Trump's interpreter for more information about the Hamburg meeting, which is how they learned of the president's request to keep the details under wraps, the Post reported.
In a news conference after the meeting, Tillerson said Putin denied interfering in the 2016 election, but refused to say how Trump responded to the denial, per the Post. Officials told the Post that the only detail from the meeting that the interpreter did share was that Trump told Putin, "I believe you. "
Trump denied the report during an interview with Fox News host Jeanine Pirro on Saturday. He called the Post "basically the lobbyist for Amazon," because it is owned by the tech giant's CEO Jeff Bezos, a Trump critic.
"I’m not keeping anything under wraps," Trump said. "I couldn't care less. "
"I have a one-on-one meeting with Putin like I do with every other leader. I have many one-on-one, nobody ever says anything about it," Trump told Pirro. "But with Putin, they say, 'Oh, what did they talk about?'"
"I meet with Putin, and they make a big deal. Anybody could have listened to that meeting. that meeting is up for grabs," Trump said, adding that he and Putin spoke about Israel and "lots of other things. "
Trump dismissed the "whole Russia thing" as a "terrible hoax" and said he won in 2016 because he "was a better candidate than Hillary Clinton," not because of collusion with Russian efforts to undermine her campaign.
"The fact is, I was obviously a good candidate. I won every debate. I won everything I did, and I won, and I won easily – 306-223, I believe," Trump said, referring to his performance in the Electoral College.
Democrats were alarmed by The Washington Post report.
Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N. H. , has sought details from Trump's meetings with Putin and, after the 2018 Helsinki meeting, called for the president's interpreter to testify before Congress.
Trump's interpreter: Should she be compelled to tell what she heard during private meeting with Putin?
In August, she and Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N. J. , sent Secretary of State Mike Pompeo a letter requesting records from that meeting, including the interpreter's notes. They cited the "extraordinary and, to our knowledge, unprecedented circumstances of President Trump’s two hour, one-on-one meeting with a leader identified as a threat to the United States by President Trump’s own National Security Strategy. "
"When he takes the interpreter's notes and wants to destroy them so no one can see what was said in written transcript, you know it raises serious questions about the relationship between this president and Putin," Sen. Dick Durbin said Sunday on ABC's "This Week. "
Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va. , said if the Post's report is accurate, Trump "broke all protocol. "
"The American government does not know what was discussed between Trump and Vladimir Putin in that, frankly, pathetic, embarrassing encounter where Trump was kowtowing on the world stage to Vladimir Putin in Helsinki," Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said on CNN's "State of the Union. "
Analysis: Friends or foes? Trump's embrace of Putin prompts backlash
Helsinki transcript: White House says it was not 'malicious'
House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel, D-N. Y. , plans to seek more information about Trump's meetings with Putin.
"It’s been several months since Helsinki and we still don’t know what went on in that meeting," Engel told the Post. "It’s appalling. It just makes you want to scratch your head. "
House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. , said Sunday that he accepted Trump's denial and said those one-on-one meetings are part of the president's personal style.
"He likes to create a personal relationship, build that relationship, even rebuild that relationship like he does with other world leaders around," McCarthy said on "Face the Nation. "
When asked if thought Trump's interpreter should be asked to testify, McCarthy said, "I want this president to be able to build the relationship, even on a personal level, with all the world leaders. "

Resumen: [...]target conservatives with the message that climate change is a liberal hoax, and paint anyone who takes the issue seriously as "out of touch with reality." A 1981 internal Mobil memo discovered by the Climate Investigations Center is an evaluation of the first decade of Mobil's advertorial program, and it makes the company's goals clear: "Not only is the company presenting its opinion to key opinion leaders, but it has been engaging in continuing debate with the New York Times itself. [...]the paper has even changed to positions similar to Mobil's on at least seven key energy issues."

Texto completo: Late last year, the Trump administration released the latest national climate assessment on Black Friday in what many assumed was an attempt to bury the document.

If that was the plan, it backfired. Much of the coverage used an old practice, one that has been weaponized by the fossil fuel industry: false equivalence.

Documents uncovered by journalists and activists over the past decade reveal a clear strategy:

• First, target media outlets to get them to report more on the "uncertainties" in climate science, and position industry-backed contrarian scientists as expert sources for media.

• Second, target conservatives with the message that climate change is a liberal hoax, and paint anyone who takes the issue seriously as "out of touch with reality."

The Heartland Institute, which hosts an annual International Conference on Climate Change known as the leading climate skeptics conference, for example, routinely calls out media outlets (including The Washington Post) for showing "bias" in covering climate change when they either decline to quote a skeptic or question a skeptic's credibility.

The campaign has worked. By 2010, the American public's belief in climate change hit an all-time low of 48 percent, despite the fact that those 20 years saw increased research, improved climate models and several climate change predictions coming true.

By demanding "balance," the industry transformed climate change into a partisan issue.

In an analysis of 636 articles covering climate change that appeared in "prestige U.S. outlets" from 1988 to 2002, researchers from the University of California at Santa Cruz and American University found that 52.65 percent presented climate science and contrarian theories as equal.

Republican politicians made the cable news rounds, too, spouting familiar tall tales about climate change being normal and cyclical or sun spots and volcanoes being the real culprits. Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, repeated the "the climate always changes" story on CNN, while Rick Santorum, informal White House adviser Stephen Moore and British politician Nigel Farage pushed the "climate scientists getting rich" narrative.

In an exhaustive survey of ExxonMobil's advertorials from 1977 to 2014, science historian Naomi Oreskes and researcher Geoffrey Supran found that these pieces often look and read a lot like op-eds but are paid for by an advertiser.

Researchers found that "83 percent of peer-reviewed papers and 80 percent of internal documents acknowledge that climate change is real and human-caused, yet only 12 percent of advertorials do so, with 81 percent instead expressing doubt.

A 1981 internal Mobil memo discovered by the Climate Investigations Center is an evaluation of the first decade of Mobil's advertorial program, and it makes the company's goals clear: "Not only is the company presenting its opinion to key opinion leaders, but it has been engaging in continuing debate with the New York Times itself. In fact, the paper has even changed to positions similar to Mobil's on at least seven key energy issues."

It's well past time the news media stopped allowing itself to be a tool in the fossil fuel industry's information war.

Texto completo: Depending on who you talk to, dieting is life-changing, terrible for you, optimistic, misguided, will keep you alive or put you in an early grave. Then there's all that lingo that comes with mastering the biological theories behind dieting, like ketosis and alkaline and lectin — phrases that make you feel like you're in a science class rather than just trying to shed a few pounds or live a healthier life. Have no fear, because we've got a simplified guide for you about the trendiest diets going into the new year — that self-conscious time when everyone's re-evaluating their lifestyle. With each diet description is a rating of its effectiveness, done by U.S. News and World Report in August. We've included their findings, based on input from a panel of health experts, on weight loss and healthiness for each diet. While doing this study they took into account the diet being "relatively easy to follow, nutritious, safe, effective for weight loss and protective against diabetes and heart disease." Without further ado, here are the diet trends you're likely to see referenced in celebrity Instagram captions in 2019:
Ketogenic Perhaps the biggest fad that's riding its wave of popularity right into 2019 is the Ketogenic, or "Keto," diet. Celebs like Kourtney Kardashian, Al Roker and Vinny Guadagnino (who affectionately went by the nickname "Keto Guido" on the new seasons of "Jersey Shore") have popularized the diet.
Ketogenic diets are low on carbs and high on fat, which puts the body in a state of ketosis. Ketosis is a metabolic state that happens when your body doesn't have enough carbohydrates for your cells to burn for energy. So instead, it burns fat.
The Keto diet is very effective at slimming your waistline, but does cause huge changes to your body that are not always positive. U.S. News & World Report says that changing the way your body is fueled from carbs to fat can lead to leg cramps, dehydration, brain fog, dizziness and more.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.8/5 Weight Loss | 1.6/5 Healthy
Paleo The philosophy of this diet is in the name. The Paleo diet encourages people to eat foods that would have been available to our Paleolithic ancestors. In case you need to brush up on your high school science, the Paleolithic era started 2.5 million years ago.
Basically, with this diet you're looking at meals that could either be hunted or gathered — lean meats, fish, vegetables, nuts and seeds. And, because farming hadn't been developed yet in the Paleolithic era, Paleo dieters are expected to cut out foods that became popularized through farming like dairy products, legumes and grains, as well. Those who follow the Paleo diet believe that modern eating habits don't suit our prehistoric genetic makeup, so we should return to Stone Age-approved meals.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.5/5 Weight Loss | 2.5/5 Healthy
Alkaline Diet Acid is the enemy of the Alkaline diet. The thought behind this diet is to cut out foods that cause your body to produce acid – including meat, wheat, refined sugar, processed foods, dairy, eggs, canned food, packaged snacks, caffeine and alcohol. You may be thinking: what else is there to eat?
The Alkaline diet approves of most fruits and vegetables, nuts, legumes, soybeans and tofu. These are foods that are alkaline — in other words have a pH value of 7, which is neutral, or above. Foods with a pH value below 7 are acidic, and therefore a no-go.
That said, there is no solid science to support that regulating the pH values of your food will change the overall pH balance of your body. It will do that naturally. However, in general, eating a lot of fruits and veggies and avoiding processed foods will make you lose weight.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.1/5 Weight Loss | 2.9/5 Healthy
Whole30 A popular diet that spurred a New York Times bestselling book, Whole30 encourages people to eat foods with as few ingredients as possible, and all those ingredients should be substances you know and can pronounce. A head of broccoli? Go for it. A piece of candy made with things like glycerin, citric acid, potassium sorbate, red 40 and soy lecithin? Not so much.
The program's website claims that if you completely avoid foods such as alcohol, anything with added sugar, legumes, dairy and more, for 30 days, you will "eliminate cravings, restore a healthy metabolism, heal the digestive tract, reduce systemic inflammation, and discover how these foods are truly impacting how you look, how you feel, and your quality of life." This program also advocates not stepping on a scale, to make the diet more about health than weight loss.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.3/5 on Weight Loss | 2.4/5 on Healthy
Mediterranean The Mediterranean diet advocates heart-healthy foods that are typically eaten in the Mediterranean. The diet guides people to eat plenty of plants and foods that are low on "bad" cholesterol, such as legumes, nuts, wheat, fruits and veggies. For example, in this diet, you replace butter with healthy fats like olive oil, salt with herbs and spices, and red meat with fish and poultry.
Plus, it totally encourages a glass of red wine every now and then. In essence, you're not avoiding fats and carbs, you're just choosing the healthier versions.
U.S. News & World Report: 3.0/5 on Weight loss | 4.8/5 on Healthy
Flexitarian Think of the Flexitarian diet as vegetarian with a lot of cheat days. The term applies to people who typically eat meatless but occasionally incorporate meat or fish into their diet. New York Times columnist Mark Bittman (who also wrote "VB6: Eat Vegan Before 6:00") has a big role in popularizing this diet. Bittman, as his book title suggests, advocates eating vegan before 6 p.m.
An easier way to ease into this diet is by doing a few meatless days a week, says Dawn Jackson Blatner, the author of "The Flexitarian Diet" and a registered dietitian, until you reach the top tier, which is five meatless days a week.
U.S. News & World Report: 3.3/5 on Weight loss | 4.6/5 on Healthy
Lectin-free We can trace the popularity of this diet back to Kelly Clarkson's praise of "The Plant Paradox Cookbook" by Dr. Steve Gundry.
She said this book helped her achieve her recent weight loss. Gundry has a long, science-fiction-esque explanation about why plants high in lectins (a kind of protein) like beans, legumes and whole grains are bad for you. An extraordinarily simplified version of his theory is that lectins in the plants cause confusion in the immune system and inflammation.
An extraordinarily dramatized version of his theory is that plants are waging war against us so we don't eat them and we're too dumb to adjust our diets. It's true lectins can be toxic in some cases, but much of Gundry's research is based on inconsistent evidence.

Texto completo: When President Donald Trump invoked the term "American carnage" in his inaugural address, he wasn't referring to gun violence, but the label undeniably fits: Record numbers of Americans are killing themselves or each other with firearms.
During the first year of Trump's presidency, guns were used to kill 39,773 Americans, the greatest number of such deaths since the government began tracking them in 1979, according to a recent report from federal health officials. Suicides made up more than half the total.
A United States awash in firearms, approximately one for every resident, continues to lead the world in gun-related homicides at a rate four to 16 times higher than any other advanced nation.
Two of the five worst mass shootings in recent U.S. history occurred in 2017, including in Las Vegas where a gunman barricaded in a high-rise hotel slaughtered 58 people at a music concert below. Mass killings kept happening last year: at a high school in Parkland, Florida; another school in Santa Fe, Texas; a synagogue in Pittsburgh; and a bar in Thousand Oaks, California. Then, of course, there was the daily toll of less-publicized shootings and self-inflicted fatalities.
Even with Democrats taking power in the House, relying on Congress to do anything about this growing national health crisis seems a distant dream, particularly given the power of the national gun lobby and continued Republican control of the Senate and White House.
The good news is that after the Parkland shooting, more than half the states enacted new restrictions on firearms. Absent new federal gun-control legislation, here are three ideas to staunch the killing:
More states could follow Massachusetts' lead and require an identification card to purchase rifles or shotguns and a license to buy handguns. The restrictions go further than federal background checks. Applicants pay a $100 fee and are photographed, fingerprinted and interviewed, and they take a gun safety course. Licensing extends to private sales, negating the so-called gun-show loophole. Finally, police can deny a handgun license to an applicant deemed a public threat.
It's surely no coincidence that Massachusetts boasts the lowest gun-death rate in the nation at 3.4 per 100,000.
Financial institutions could alert authorities to highly unusual credit card activity related to purchasing guns and ammunition. A New York Times analysis of 13 mass shootings during the past decade revealed that in at least eight cases, killers racked up thousands of dollars on credit cards buying firearms and ammo, often where they couldn't otherwise have afforded the arsenal.
Slightly more than half of suicides in America are committed with a firearm. More states could adopt "red flag" laws that allow families, often in voluntary cooperation with the relative who is suicidal, to obtain a temporary court order for seizing that person's firearm for a limited period of time until the crisis passes. The order would also prevent that person from purchasing a gun during the same period. Thirteen states have such laws.
Despite the disconnect between the majority of Americans who want sensible gun control and a Congress that does nothing about it, headway is possible through the states and by pressuring commercial businesses such as banks. American carnage doesn't have to be a tragedy without end.

Texto completo: Trump slams report that FBI probed if he worked for Russia
President Donald Trump on Saturday angrily rejected a New York Times report that said the FBI opened an investigation in 2017 to determine whether he worked, knowingly or unknowingly, on behalf of Russia.
The report said that in the days after Trump fired Comey as FBI director in May 2017, the agency began investigating whether the president had been working on behalf of Russia against American interests.
The newspaper cited unidentified law enforcement officials and others familiar with the investigation.
U.S. counterintelligence investigators attempted to assess whether Trump's actions constituted a possible threat to national security, and agents also tried to determine whether Trump was knowingly working for Russia or had unknowingly come under Moscow's influence, the Times reported.
Trump has repeatedly denounced the FBI and Justice Department.
"The corrupt former leaders of the FBI, almost all fired or forced to leave the agency for some very bad reasons, opened up an investigation on me, for no reason & with no proof, after I fired Lyin' James Comey, a total sleaze!" the president tweeted. "My firing of James B. Comey was a great day for America. He was a Crooked Cop."
The president also criticized familiar targets including special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, and Democrat Hillary Clinton.
Trump concluded Saturday by asserting that he'd been tougher on Russia than former U.S. presidents.

S. Korea balks at Trump's push over more funds for U.S. troops
WASHINGTON -- South Korea is resisting a Trump administration demand for sharply higher payments to defray the cost of basing U.S. forces on its territory, raising fears that President Donald Trump might threaten a troop drawdown at a time of sensitive diplomacy on the Korean Peninsula.
U.S. negotiators have sought a 50 percent increase in Seoul's annual payment, which last year was about $830 million, or about half of the estimated cost of hosting 28,500 U.S. troops, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the discussions.
South Korea is expected to make a counteroffer this month.
The standoff is straining the alliance as Trump plans a second summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to renew the U.S. push for elimination of Pyongyang's nuclear arsenal.

Former Obama housing chief Castro enters 2020 campaign
SAN ANTONIO -- Assailing President Donald Trump for "a crisis of leadership," former Obama Cabinet member Julian Castro joined the 2020 presidential race Saturday as a rush of Democrats accelerates.
Castro, 44, could end up being the only Latino in a crowded Democratic field. He was San Antonio's mayor for five year and U.S. housing secretary in President Barack Obama's second term. He became the second Democrat to formally enter the race, after former Maryland Rep. John Delaney.
Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., have formed exploratory committees. Casto's first trip as a candidate comes Monday to Puerto Rico, where an outcry has begun as the White House considers diverting disaster funding to pay for a border wall.

U.S. calls for the formation of new government in Venezuela
ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates -- The U.S. stepped up its criticism of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro on Saturday with an explicit call for the formation of a new government in the South American country.
The State Department said in a statement that it stood behind the head of Venezuela's opposition-run congress, Juan Guaido, who said Friday that he was prepared to step into the presidency temporarily. The statement was the latest in a series of Trump administration attacks on Maduro, whose inauguration to a new term as president Thursday has been widely denounced as illegitimate.
"The people of Venezuela deserve to live in freedom in a democratic society governed by the rule of law," State Department spokesman Robert Palladino said.

Pompeo upbeat on deal with Turkey over Kurds
ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates -- Despite Turkey's vows to the contrary, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Saturday he was confident the two nations can agree on a way to protect U.S.-allied Kurdish rebels in Syria after American troops withdraw from the country.
After speaking to Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, Pompeo said an agreement was a work in progress but can be achieved in a way that allows the Turks to defend their country while leaving alone Kurds who do not pose a threat.
The top U.S. diplomat said he was "optimistic" that Kurds who fought alongside U.S. forces against the Islamic State group in Syria are not threatened by pledges from Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to launch military operations against what he terms Kurdish "terrorists."

Hamas probe: Israel tried to wiretap group in Gaza Strip
GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip -- Gaza's ruling Hamas said Saturday that Israeli undercover forces had attempted to install equipment to monitor the Islamic militant group's landline communications network during a botched mission in November.
The findings of an investigation were announced by the Hamas military wing, Qassam Brigades, in a prerecorded TV statement.
Hamas presented surveillance footage and photos to back up its claims.
Hamas thwarted an attempt to "plant spying devices in the Gaza Strip," a Qassam spokesman said in the statement.
Israel's military has not released details about the operation, which went awry Nov. 11, leading to the heaviest round of cross-border fire, including Hamas rockets and Israeli airstrikes, since a 2014 war between the two sides.

Still missing: Police arrested 12 people alleged to have been involved in the kidnapping of an American in Costa Rica. Police say a joint operation caught nine Costa Rican suspects Friday; three others were arrested in Spain. William Sean Creighton Kopko was abducted Sept. 24, 2018, in Costa Rica. He is still missing.

In Congo: Presidential runner-up Martin Fayulu has asked a constitutional court to order a recount. He has accused the winner, Felix Tshisekedi, of a deal with President Joseph Kabila. An official said Fayulu has two options: accept the vote or it is annulled, which would keep Kabila in power until another election.

Texto completo: 4 Panama
New eco-friendly resorts open on the country's Pacific coast
Two new Pacific island resorts are expanding Panama's west coast appeal, not far from the marine preserve around Isla Coiba. Cayuga Hospitality recently opened Isla Palenque in the Gulf of Chiriqui, with eight casitas and one villa on a lush 400-acre island. Besides offering access to seven beaches, mangrove kayaking and whale-watching, the resort grows some of its own food, has furniture made from fallen trees and maintains a no-plastics policy, including subbing papaya shoots for straws. In the Gulf of Chiriqui, Islas Secas Reserve & Panama Lodge will open in January on a 14-island archipelago. The solar-powered, nine-bungalow lodge will offer sport fishing and scuba diving, and will compost food waste and will recycle water for irrigation. A Ritz-Carlton Reserve property is also under construction in the Pearl Islands. ELAINE GLUSAC
5 Munich
Theater. Art. Opera. What more do you want?
As far as cultural triple threats go, it's hard to beat Munich, the capital of Germany's Bavaria region. Its theaters are considered among the most creative and ambitious in Europe, with its two main companies, the Münchner Kammerspiele and the Residenztheater (the latter entering its final year under the acclaimed artistic director Martin Kusej) producing more than 30 premieres between January and May 2019. And its museums are decidedly world class, especially since the renovation and reopening of the Lenbachhaus Museum in 2017, with its unmatched collection of the German artists known as the Blue Rider school. But perhaps the best argument for visiting Munich right now is the Bavarian State Opera, which has emerged as one of the most exciting opera houses in Europe. The reason? In the words of a New York Times classical music critic, "the miracle of Kirill Petrenko." Mr. Petrenko has just two more years remaining on his contract as music director at the Opera. This summer, he will conduct a new production of Richard Strauss's "Salome," with the opening night performance on June 27. STUART EMMRICH
6 Eilat, Israel
A newly accessible Red Sea paradise
Beneath the prismatic waters of this Red Sea resort on Israel's southern tip lies a coral reef with hundreds of varieties of neon fish, sharks and stingrays. To get there, visitors used to have to catch a charter flight from Tel Aviv or brave the dusty drive through the Negev Desert. But with the opening early this year of Ramon Airport, set in the Timna Valley and capable of handling four million international transit passengers a year, the world will finally get a direct route -- with nonstops from Munich and Frankfurt on Lufthansa, and budget carriers flying in from Prague, London and across Europe. New hotels, including the luxurious Six Senses Shaharut, opening just in time for Israel's turn at hosting the Eurovision 2019 song contest, are ready for the crowds. DEBRA KAMIN
7 Setouchi, Japan
Art and nature harmonize in Japan's inland sea
The Setouchi region, which includes the Seto Inland Sea's islands and coastal areas, will host the Setouchi Trienniale 2019, a major art fair held in three seasonal installments. One hour south of the "art islands" via ferry or the Shinkansen bullet train, the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum reopens this spring after an eight-year refurbishment. Setouchi is also looking to draw a fresh crop of cyclists, with new trails and a dedicated Shimanami bike ferry that opened in October connecting Japan's main island of Honshu to the region's lesser-visited island of Shikoku. For those seeking more sybaritic forms of transport, 2017 had the maiden voyage of Guntu -- more a minimalist floating ryokan than a cruise ship -- with 19 walnut-clad rooms and open-air cypress soaking baths. In 2019, Setouchi Sea Planes, Japan's only sea plane company, will expand its scenic flights to several smaller islands and towns via Kodiak 100s. And a Japanese start-up, Ale, launched -- literally -- the Shooting Star Challenge, a microsatellite that will create the world's first artificial meteor shower, aiming to fill Setouchi's skies in spring 2020, a taste of the high-tech one-upmanship to come in Tokyo's 2020 Olympics.

8 Aalborg, Denmark
Architecture revitalizes the waterfront
Viking long ships once glided through Aalborg's mighty Limfjord. Today, the city is turning its most famous natural asset into an artistic one. Wildly innovative buildings have sprouted on Aalborg's shores, including the Utzon Center, designed by Jorn Utzon, the architect of the Sydney Opera House -- check out its new exhibition series on inspiring Nordic architects, with a first show that runs through May. The curvilinear concert hall Musikkens Hus was recently followed by the vibrant Aalborg Street Food market; the pedestrian and cycling Culture Bridge; and the undulating Vestre Fjordpark, with an open-air swimming pool that meets the sea. The pioneering Nordkraft, a power plant that was converted into a cultural hub, is celebrating its 10th anniversary with special events in September. The historic Aalborg Akvavit distillery, which produced the potent Scandinavian spirit, is being transformed into a new creative district over the next two years, presided over by a soaring glass polygonal sculpture by the Argentine artist Tomás Saraceno, Harbour Gate from the Danish superstar architect Bjarke Ingels, a hotel and more.

Texto completo: The most interesting thing in conservative politics right now is not the government shutdown and Donald Trump's flailing attempt to claim victory while being defeated on all fronts. Instead it's an ideological battle over Tucker Carlson's recent Fox News soliloquy, in which he accused his fellow Republicans of building an anti-family, finance-dominated economic system that might be "the enemy of a healthy society."
Carlson's monologue was an expansion of themes that have dominated his reinvention as a Trump-era populist -- the general folly of elites, the unwisdom of the bipartisan consensus on immigration and foreign policy, the failure of Republican leaders to defend the national interest.
But in expanding on those themes he went somewhere that Fox hosts rarely go -- from culture into economics, from a critique of liberal cosmopolitanism into a critique of libertarianism, from a lament for the decline of the family to an argument that this decline can be laid at the feet of consumer capitalism as well as social liberalism.
[ Listen to "The Argument" podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt. ]
Just about every conservative worth reading was provoked into responding. One set of responses accused Carlson of a kind of conspiratorial socialism, which exaggerates economic misery, ignores capitalism's fruits, and encourages ordinary people to blame shadowy elites instead of cultivating personal responsibility.
The other group basically said, no, Tucker has a point -- the point being that market economies are inevitably shaped by public policy, that policies championed by both parties have failed to promote the interests of the working class, and that social conservatives especially need a framework of political economy to promote the institutions -- family, work, neighborhood -- upon which civil society depends.
If there is to be a healthy American right, after Donald Trump or ever, this is the argument that conservatives should be having. And it is especially an argument that Fox News should be highlighting, since Fox is frequently responsible for stoking populism but keeping it vacuous or racialized, evading the debates the right really needs.
Now let me attempt my own quick contribution. A key issue in the Carlson contretemps is distilled in this line from David French of National Review, one of the monologue's critics: "There are wounds that public policy can't heal."
This is a crucial conservative insight, a caution for policymakers everywhere -- but it can also become a trap, a cul-de-sac, an excuse for doing nothing. And that has happened too often for conservatives in recent decades: They've leaped to despair without even trying policy.
Let me give three examples. Modern conservatism was forged in the crucible of the 1970s inflation crisis, and in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crash many conservatives were convinced that there was nothing the Federal Reserve could do about the vast army of the unemployed without touching off a similar inflationary spiral.
But in hindsight this was wrong, the feared inflation never came, and the economic recovery was slowed because of the Republican fixation on tight money. Of course, in the Trump era some Republicans have conveniently become dovish on inflation. But in the preceding eight years, wage-earning Americans suffered unnecessarily because of a wrongheaded right-wing counsel of despair.
A second example: While it's true that family breakdown has deep and tangled roots, it's also true that in the 1940s and 1950s, a mix of government policy, union strength and conservative gender norms established a "family wage" -- an income level that enabled a single breadwinner to support a family.
Maybe it isn't possible to recreate a family wage for a less unionized and more feminist age -- but are we sure? Is there really nothing conservatives can do to address the costs of child care, the unfulfilled parental desire to shift to part-time work, the problem that a slightly more reactionary iteration of Elizabeth Warren once dubbed "the two-income trap"? If marriages and intact families and birthrates declined as the family wage crumbled, perhaps we should try rebuilding that economic foundation before we declare the crisis of the family a wound that policy can't heal.
A final example: Historically conservatism has been proudly paternalist, favorable to forms of censorship and prohibition for the sake of protecting precisely the private virtues that Carlson's critics think government can't cultivate. But in recent decades, the right's elites have despaired of censoring pornography, acquiesced to the spread of casino gambling, made peace with the creeping commercialization of marijuana, and accepted the internet's conquest of childhood and adolescence.
Yet none of these trends actually seem entirely beyond the influence of regulation. It's just that conservatism has given up -- once again, in unwarranted despair -- on earlier assumptions about how public paternalism can encourage private virtue.
The deeper point here is that public policy is rarely a cure-all, but it can often be a corrective. And the part of Carlson's monologue his critics should especially ponder is the end, when he suggests that absent a corrective that "protects normal families," even the normal will eventually turn to socialism -- choosing a left-wing overcorrection over a right that just says, Well, you see, we already cut corporate taxes, so there's nothing we can do.

Texto completo: President Trump is considering taking more than $2 billion already approved by Congress for flood control projects in California to help fund the building of his controversial border wall, according to a Democratic lawmaker.
Rep. John Garamendi, D-Fairfield, said in an interview Friday that the Army Corps of Engineers presented a list of funded but unbuilt projects including new levees to protect homes, schools and businesses on San Francisco Bay's shoreline in North San Jose to
the president as he headed to Texas on Thursday to bolster his case for a $5.7 billion border wall.
The corps list that Garamendi's office provided to this news organization highlighted projects in California and Puerto Rico from a list of $13.9 billion in flood control and disaster relief efforts in states including Texas, Florida, West Virginia and Louisiana. It includes $2.47 billion that had been approved in California for flood control projects along the American and Yuba rivers near Sacramento, Lake Isabella in Kern County and the Santa Ana River in Southern California.
Bay Area officials said Friday that they are stunned by the possibility that money already approved by Congress for an important flood control project on San Jose's shoreline could somehow be shifted to Trump's wall project.
The project would build 4 miles of new levees around Alviso and nearby areas over the next four years to protect flood-prone communities in major winter storms and as the bay's water level continues to rise from climate change.
"This bothers the hell out of me," said Dick Santos, a member of the Santa Clara Valley Water District. "I will do everything I can to protect that money."
The White House press office did not respond Friday to questions about the list of Long Term Disaster Recovery Investment Plan projects funded under the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, and signed into law by Trump last year.
Garamendi, a former California lieutenant governor and insurance commissioner, sits on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, which oversees federal water projects. Asked how he knew the highlighted projects on the list were candidates for diverting funding for a border wall, Garamendi said: "A little birdie told me so. There are ways we find out what's going on."
"Each of these projects are essential for the preservation of life and property," Garamendi said.
The New York Times also reported late Thursday that the White House had "directed the Army Corps of Engineers to determine whether it can divert for wall construction $13.9 billion allocated last year," citing Defense Department and congressional officials who insisted on anonymity.
The idea didn't sit well with Trump's fellow Republicans in Congress from California. Parker Williams, communications director for Rep. Doug LaMalfa, RRichvale, said, "Congressman LaMalfa has already expressed concern with this idea, and he believes that any move would need careful consideration before acting on it."
Garamendi said Congress had authorized and appropriated money for the listed projects but the work had not yet been contracted out, so the funding was considered "unobligated." He also noted that the only identified projects were in California and Puerto Rico, while those in Republicanled states were untouched.
"There's a political dynamic in play here," Garamendi said. Trump, after saying all week he was considering declaring a national emergency to try to push through border wall funding without congressional approval, seemed to back off Friday, but left the door open.
"What we're not looking to do right now is national emergency," Trump said Friday afternoon, flanked by law enforcement officials at a White House press event. "I'm not going to do it so fast."
But that did little to comfort California officials' concerns that their water projects are off the hook.
Santos noted that the $177 million South Bay Shoreline Project has been in the planning stages for years, and that work has been scheduled to start this summer.
The new earthen levees, which are planned to be 15 feet high, replacing old levees that are roughly 5 to 10 feet high, is part of ongoing restoration efforts to convert former Cargill industrial salt ponds in the South Bay back to tidal marshes for fish and wildlife.
"That project is vital for Silicon Valley," Santos said Friday. "It protects the wastewater treatment plant, Levi's Stadium, medical facilities, schools, tech companies and the homes of thousands of people. We're trying to avoid becoming another New Orleans after Katrina."
Sam Schuchat, executive officer of the California Coastal Conservancy, a state agency based in Oakland that has been working closely on the project with the water district and the corps, said it would be "outrageous" if Trump tried to shift money that Congress approved for flood projects last year.
"We've been working on this since 2002," he said. "This area is 15 feet below sea level. They had a huge flood in the 1980s. Alviso is probably the most at-risk place along San Francisco Bay for flooding. People die in floods, and property is destroyed."
Schuchat said that his agency is exploring every option to keep the money, including speeding up the process to sign contracts with construction companies, because once contracts are signed, it becomes much more difficult to take away the funding.
The other projects include long-planned work to reduce flood risk in the Sacramento area and Central Valley, including finishing a levee around Marysville, a flood-prone area in Yuba County, raising Folsom Dam and expanding flood protection on the American River to reduce risk in Sutter and Sacramento counties.
Democrats say that they support border security but have refused Trump's requested $5.7 billion funding for a border wall, a core campaign pledge that they consider a waste. The resulting standoff with the president, who has refused to sign spending bills without it, has left much of the federal government shuttered for what will become a record duration of 22 days today.
With no sign of compromise in the works despite mounting pressure on both sides to reopen the government, Trump has repeatedly suggested he could declare an emergency at the border and use that authority to divert unspent funds for a border wall.
Congressional Democrats said they will fight any move to shift the money.
"Congress allocated these taxpayer dollars for vital flood protection projects all over the country, including projects that safeguard Sacramento and over half a million of my constituents," Democratic Rep. Doris Matsui of Sacramento said in a statement to the Sacramento Bee on Thursday night. "It's unconscionable that President Trump wants to take Sacramento's flood protection funding away to build his border wall, which he repeated, time and time again, that Mexico would pay for."

Texto completo: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has found himself back in a familiar position, playing lead obstructionist as a House of Representatives that isn't controlled by his party tries to pass bills to reopen the federal government without blowing billions on President Donald Trump's border wall.
McConnell, who refused to give Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland even a hearing with nearly a year left in President Barack Obama's final term, can now proudly claim another record, as the government shutdown that President Donald Trump said he would take credit for has become the longest in American history.
While it's Trump who won't budge on getting money for his project, which most Americans don't support and the country doesn't need, it's McConnell who seems too scared or too heartless to break with the tantrum tyrant in the Oval Office.
He's not alone, of course. West Virginia Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, in an interview this week, said she wants to see a "firm commitment from the Democrats on a number of dollars to spend toward securing the border before reopening the government. When asked about when the government shutdown - which has furloughed federal workers while others are working without paychecks - might end, she replied, "It ends with the American people saying enough is enough.
Haven't the American people been saying that for a while now? If not leading up to and throughout this shutdown, didn't they say it at the polls in the midterms?
Capito's statement is a great example of how out-of-touch the U.S. Senate remains with the average American. Now, perhaps Capito and fellow Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., are getting a lot of calls from constituents telling them to "build the wall. That idea might still be popular in one of the last states where Trump's approval rating is still above water, despite everything the president has done to try and hurt West Virginians who rely on federal spending to live a decent life.
As for McConnell, who knows? When confronted with everyday constituents, whom he avoids at all costs, the senate majority leader seems to react like a vampire presented with a crucifix.
According to The New York Times, some Republican senators, especially those up for re-election in 2020, are starting to doubt the president. When they asked questions in a meeting with Trump mid-week, according to The Times, they were not given answers, but told to band together and remain loyal. This was a few hours before the self-proclaimed master deal-maker walked out of a very short meeting with Democratic leadership because they refused to immediately cave to his demands.
McConnell will only hold a vote to reopen the government if there's sufficient pressure from his own people in the Senate and in large enough numbers to mandate the president sign such a bill.
McConnell has no problem riding out a storm and not taking any action, no matter how many Americans - whether they are government workers or people who rely on government services - get burned. That's why it's up to Senators like Capito and Manchin to apply pressure to end this pointless shutdown and get government back to work.
It's all cold calculation to McConnell. If he sees the numbers, this thing could be over. It's up to those who think beyond party and vote ratio to end this.

Pegan diet could be next big trend

Texto completo: There's a new trendy diet in town, folks – the pegan diet.
The word pegan has seen a 337 percent increase in searches on Pinterest over the past year, with a steady climb in searches within the last six months.
It was born when Dr. Mark Hyman, New York Times best-selling author, coined the term – a mashup of paleo and vegan – in a blog post that detailed his own diet.
What is a pegan diet? In short, a pegan diet incorporates pieces of the paleo and vegan diets.
A person on a vegan diet refrains from eating all animal products or byproducts – no meat, eggs, cheese, yogurt and sometimes gelatin. A paleo diet is a nutritional plan that mimics how people used to eat in the Paleolithic era 2.5 million years ago. So dieters eat unprocessed foods consisting mostly of vegetables, fruits, nuts, grass-fed meats and fish.
How does pegan differ? Although vegan and paleo diets may seem like they're at odds – one advocates for removing dairy, meat and fish while the other encourages eating meat and fish – the root of both of those lifestyles is ultimately the same: eating whole foods and plants.
The purpose of the pegan diet is to get people to eat whole foods that are fresh and organic and increase their vegetable intake.
There's also an emphasis on the quality of foods you're eating – the pegan diet encourages participants to eat organic products.
What are you supposed to eat? Plants. Basically most of your diet will be made up of vegetables, good fats and nuts and seeds.
The physician explained that 75 percent of the diet should be fruits and vegetables while avoiding dairy and gluten.
But if you must eat dairy, the diet advises reaching for sheep- or goat-based dairy products. Maria Marlowe, a nutrition health coach and author who operates her own nutrition health coaching practice in New York City, said this is because goat and sheep's milk are easier to digest than cow's milk, but it's preferable to avoid all dairy.
Hyman said that meat is not necessarily harmful and has good health benefits. It just depends on how much you're eating and what kind you're eating. The doctor, who is also director of the Cleveland Clinic Center for Functional Medicine, suggests eating meat sparingly and eating only grass-fed and sustainably raised meat.
Basically, eat meat as a side dish, not the main course.
Those on a pegan diet should also eat healthy fats like those found in nuts, avocados, coconut oil and even saturated fat from organic meat products.
And, as with most diets, sugar should be avoided or eaten only as a treat.
Is the pegan diet safe? Desiree Nielsen, a registered dietitian who runs her own nutrition consulting practice and hosts "The Urban Vegetarian," a Canadian cooking show, doesn't recommend the pegan diet because of how restrictive it is – she actually advises against all diets that are restrictive. However, she does believe that the pegan diet is a great way to transition into a healthier and more plant-based lifestyle.
"There isn't one right way to eat," said Nielsen. "I think it's a wonderful diet to be inspired by. Eat more plants; eat more whole foods – those are wonderful messages to incorporate, but I think for many of us, living by a restrictive rule-focused diet may not be healthy for our body or our minds."
What are the benefits? Although the pegan diet may not be right for everyone, it has helped some.
"I grew up eating a standard American diet, which led to a slew of health problems," said Marlowe. "Eating the pegan way helped me lose 20 pounds, get rid of digestive issues, have more energy and overall improve my health."
Nielsen said that as a vegan, trying out the pegan diet left her hungry, and she suffered from low blood pressure and headaches. She said the pegan diet doesn't advocate for a lot of legumes, the source of most of the protein for plant-based eaters, and it relies some on animal protein, which vegans can't eat.
"It's a great transition towards a more plant-based diet for meat eaters," advised Nielsen. "It will increase intake of valuable phytochemicals from fruits and vegetables that help you fight inflammation. It will also help you move away from a hyper-processed and packaged eating pattern."
Liz Josefsberg, a certified personal trainer and nutrition exercise specialist, tried the pegan diet for 30 days and said that though she struggled a bit in the beginning, she enjoyed the journey and the results, including losing six pounds with little effort.
"My stomach? Noticeably flatter. My skin? Bright and clear. My cravings for cheese – and even my desire to have a glass of wine – diminished," wrote Josefsberg in a blog post. "I also noticed I had a real clarity of mind and much more energy than usual."
Organic produce is recommended as part of a pegan diet.

Dietitians recommend sheep or goat dairy products on the diet because they're easier to digest than milk from cows.

Texto completo: Q. Where I live they have been changing the crosswalk buttons to these fancy new ones that beep, flash and talk to you. Why are all of the voices men’s voices? Isn’t this the age of equality?
– Patrick Shane, North Tustin
A. Patrick lives in unincorporated county territory, near the city of Tustin. After getting some specifics on the traffic signals, he and Honk agreed the city would be best to ask, as at least some of these new-school devices are in Tustin.
Krys Saldivar , the manager of the Tustin’s Public Works Department, said the city is upgrading all of its pedestrian push buttons tied to traffic signals, with about 40 percent having these newer devices.
“Those who are blind will be able to hear where they are crossing and when to cross, and those who are deaf will feel the vibration when it is safe to cross,” she told Honk in an email. “The first ones that have been installed in the city were actually programmed by the manufacturer.”
That would be Polara, a Texas-based company.
Its president, John McGaffey , said if a city asks, Polara can provide a female voice; it has done so before. But it generally uses a male voice.
“In controlled studies using … accessible pedestrian signals, the majority of the visually impaired participants said they were able to hear a male voice better because it has greater low-range frequencies (under 800 Hz), which people can tend to hear, even with some hearing loss. We also try to keep the voice consistent so the messages sound similar, no matter where you are in the United States.”
Q. My license expires on my birthday in June. Should I go ahead and make an appointment with the Department of Motor Vehicles now because of the crowded DMV offices, with the popularity of the REAL ID? Or should I wait until they send me a notice? It’s very confusing! Thank you!
– Linda Wells, Mission Viejo
A. DMV officials and Honk readers have told the wise one, that would be Honk, that wait times have gone way down since the mess in the summer.
Still, appointments are the way to go if you must go into an office to renew your license (Typically every 15 years until you hit age 70, then every five years).
“She can make an appointment before she receives her renewal notice,” Marty Greenstein , a DMV spokesman up in Sacramento, said via email. “In fact, that’s something we encourage. If you know your license is going to expire in a few months, go ahead and make your appointment. We started sending out renewal notices 90 days in advance this summer (up from 60) to give people more time.”
The DMV takes appointments for several months out. Linda noticed that the two DMV offices near her home were completely booked. What about that?
“Appointment availability can change on a daily basis as offices perform daily assessments, or spots open when an appointment is canceled,” Greenstein said.
So keep trying, Linda.
But don’t go too early to a DMV office to renew, or you will be required to take what used to be called a “written” test and is now a “knowledge” test (it is usually done on a touchscreen these days) even if you weren’t scheduled for one. The DMV reasons that if you renew real early, then you are shortening up the time it has to monitor your track record out there on the roads, so the test is meant to ensure you are a safe motorist.
“In instances when a knowledge test is not required, coming in at any time during that 90-day window before your license expires should not trigger that requirement,” Greenstein added.
Honkin’ cool: A dad didn’t want his daughter to be alone on Christmas, so Hal Vaughan took six flights over three days to be with her. Pierce Vaughan is a rookie flight attendant for Delta Air Lines, and Dad shadowed her, able to jump on standby for free, a perk of his daughter’s job. A passenger heard about the journey, put it on Facebook and the cute story went viral. The trip: New Orleans; Detroit; Fort Myers, Fla.; Detroit; Hartford, Conn.; Atlanta; and back to New Orleans (Source: The New York Times).

LAUSD teachers went on strike in 1989. But are the stakes higher in 2019?

Texto completo: Whether they were stuck in an auditorium or playing long-term hooky, many a school kid old enough to remember the 1989 Los Angeles teachers strike recalls the period as nine days of good old-fashioned lawlessness.
Quoted in a New York Times article at the time, LAPD Lieut. Frank Valdez expressed his concern about “little predators” roaming LA’s downtown streets. “The problem kids are not going to go to school and it’s going to create problems all over, not just on campus,” he said during the strike.
Jamie Todd Rubin, an 11th-grader at Cleveland High School at the time, wistfully remembers weekday ventures to the beach, Valley bowling alleys and movie theatres while his teachers fought for better pay as his personal “golden age.”
Triumphantly, he recalled that “teachers ended up getting what they were looking for too.” In many respects, they did.
By all accounts, teachers succeeded in gleaning higher wages, more administrative control and greater stature for their union from the Los Angeles Unified School District after thousands walked off the job in the spring of 1989.
It was the second teachers strike since the founding of United Teachers Los Angeles in 1970, ushering angst into the city and turmoil to the nation’s second largest school system.
In 1989, the major win for teachers after the walkout that lasted nine days was getting school-based management and shared decision-making into a contract. Around 80 percent of members participated in the strike, and half of LAUSD K-12 students stayed home.

As an army of 30,000 teachers stand ready to form new picket lines on Monday, their demands ring markedly familiar: higher pay, relief from ballooning class sizes, and more nurses, librarians and counselors trained to address the medical and psychological needs of today’s students.
Has much really changed?
Former UTLA President John Perez, who was on the picket lines both as a teacher in 1970, said it this way:
“To be perfectly honest, very little has changed. In 1970 we felt disrespected. In 1989 we felt disrespected. And in 2018 teachers feel disrespected.”
Undercurrents of teacher empowerment were also at the crux of the 1970 strike, UTLA’s first, when around half of the young union’s members went off the job for nearly five weeks.
Then, as now, district officials threatened that acceding to their calls for salary increases would spell financial ruin.
Parallels between ’89 and today run as deep as rhetorical strategy, like the union’s relentless critiques of LA Unified Superintendent Austin Beutner.
“Oh yeah it was a big war in ’89 and the union made superintendent [Leonard] Britton the bad guy,” Perez said. Picketing teachers wore buttons with his face over a lemon, or with a slash over his face. “We called him Lenny the lemon.”
Some have argued all this recurrence is evidence that the lasting effects of earlier strikes have been mixed at best, and that securing lasting public funding for education has proven elusive over the decades.
Former LAUSD elementary school teacher Michael Romo lamented the lack of progress since 1989.
“Back in my day we had nurses, smaller class sizes and maybe even better stocked libraries,” said Romo, director of the California Teachers Association in Burbank and Glendale.
He went on strike in 1989, his first year of bilingual teaching at Norwood Street Elementary School. “For 30 years to come back to the same issue, it’s like we’ve made no progress.”
Of course, things do change in 30 years. Along with overarching economic differences and a friendlier face in the governor’s mansion, a key factor in this looming walkout that appears to have been absent from previous strikes is competing visions for the future of public education.
UCLA Professor John Rogers, director of the university’s Institute for Democracy, Education, and Access, interpreted the current impasse between the district and the union as a reflection of opposite reactions LAUSD’s current financial and enrollment woes.
“The district is thinking about how they can contain costs and deal with a growing charter school sector by devolving the district over time as a portfolio of schools,” he said. “While teachers think the way forward is to more broadly improve the quality of its own educational program, only sometimes acknowledging how much spending that requires.”
The emergence of charter schools in Los Angeles, which are privately managed but publicly funded, have been central to the standoff between district and union leadership.
Perez seems to think this is uncharted territory, particularly what he said was superintendent Beutner’s goals to break up and “privatize” the a time-honored and democratic institution like L.A. Unified.
“The existential threat to public education as we know it is real. That wasn’t there in 1989,” he said. The district’s financial woes this time around also have some experts worried about a state takeover.
“My understanding is after the strike it will appear to be a win for teachers and then the layoffs will come soon after,” said UCLA Professor of Education at the Graduate School of Education and Information Studies Pedro Noguera.
Noting LA County’s recent appointment of a fiscal team to the district, he said “That’s my fear, that they’re at risk of being taken over.”
Carmen Romero, special education teacher at South Gate High School, remembers those long days in auditoriums, in the gym and on the football field as a 10th-grader at Bell High School during the 1989 strike.
“We didn’t feel valued as students,” she said about the nine days of boredom. More of a rule-follower, she was on campus every day of the strike.
“But it made me appreciate school more, and feel like I deserve things like desks and respect.” Now that she’s gearing up to get on the picket line as a teacher, “It’s the same feeling.”

Gillibrand 2020? Presidential bid appears certain

Texto completo: ALBANY – Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand appears all but certain to launch a 2020 presidential campaign soon.
Gillibrand, a Democrat, has keyed in on the Rensselaer County city of Troy as a potential headquarters for a 2020 campaign, not far from her home in Brunswick, The Associated Press reported Thursday.
Next weekend, Politico reports Gillibrand is planning on traveling to Iowa, whose presidential caucuses are a key first step in the primary season.
And she has been staffing up for a potential bid, selecting a campaign manager, communications directors and other key positions for the coming campaign, according to various reports.
A spokesman for Gillibrand did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday.
Mulling a run for months Gillibrand has been publicly mulling a presidential run since cruising to reelection in November.
She is expected to formally announce her run in the coming days or weeks.
Long rumored to have aspirations for higher office, she first publicly confirmed she was considering a 2020 bid on Nov. 8, two days after winning reelection in New York.
"I believe right now that every one of us should figure out how we can do whatever we can with our time, with our talents to restore that moral decency, that moral compass and that truth of who we are as Americans, so I will promise you I will give it a long, hard thought of consideration," Gillibrand said then on CBS' "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert."
Gillibrand, 52, has been New York's junior senator since 2009, when she was selected by then-Gov. David Paterson to succeed Hillary Clinton, who had become secretary of state.
She's been easily reelected three times since then — in 2010, 2012 and 2018.
Prior to that, she was a congresswoman representing an Albany-area district from 2007 until she was appointed senator.
Pledged to serve full Senate term Gillibrand's apparent run comes despite repeatedly pledging to serve a full six-year term in the Senate, which would run through 2024.
Her most public pledge came during an October 2018 debate.
"I will serve my six-year term," she said then.
That led to a quick rebuttal from Republican opponent Chele Farley: "Honestly, I don't believe that."
The New York Times reported Friday that Gillibrand had hired Meredith Kelly, a former spokeswoman for Sen. Charles Schumer and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, as her 2020 communications director.
Her campaign staff will be run by Jess Fassler, her chief of staff in the Senate, and Dan McNally, who worked for Senate Democrats, according to The Wall Street Journal.
Both reports cited unnamed people who were familiar with the hirings.

Texto completo: Don't be surprised if Patrick Shanahan, the former deputy who replaced Defense Secretary Jim Mattis in an acting capacity, is still around at the end of President Trump’s first term.

The conventional wisdom around Washington is that Trump is having trouble finding anyone qualified to take the job, once Mattis resigned on principle after the president ordered all U.S. troops out of Syria against his advice.

Unlike Mattis, who was a legendary commander and a deeply read student of war and strategy, Shanahan has no military experience, aside from his 17 months at the Pentagon as Mattis’ No. 2.

But Shanahan has a halo of his own, a reputation as a "Mr. Fix-it" at Boeing, where he worked for more than 30 years and where he’s credited with shepherding Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner through its most critical development period.

Trump seems particularly enamored with Shanahan's business acumen, which he sees as a marked contrast to many of his generals, who he frequently complains lack the business savvy to prevent allies from taking advantage of the U.S.

"Shanahan is a good man, and he’s done a great job," Trump said during a Christmas visit to U.S. troops in Iraq. "And he's a good buyer. I wanted somebody that could buy, because I'm giving a lot of money and I don't want it to be wasted."

In Shanahan, Trump sees a kindred spirit, someone who knows how to drive a hard bargain and how to bring projects in on time and under budget.

At Boeing, Shanahan "did a great job," said Trump. "Very responsible for the success of a certain plane, the Dreamliner. And he's a respected man. He could be there for a long time. I mean, I'm in no rush."

Officially, the search is on for a replacement for Mattis and several names have leaked out of the White House, including former Army Vice Chief of Staff Jack Keane, former Navy Secretary and former Democratic Sen. Jim Webb of Virginia, and former Republican Sen. Jon Kyl of Arizona, who just stepped down from John McCain’s former seat to return to private life.

Keane turned down the job, citing personal reasons, although he was also on record opposing Trump's Syria withdrawal decision.

In response to a story in the New York Times about Trump’s consideration of Webb, a Democrat who embraced Trump after the 2016 election, the president tweeted that the Times story was fake news. "I'm sure he is a fine man, but I don't know Jim, and never met him," Trump said, adding that "Patrick Shanahan, who is Acting Secretary of Defense, is doing a great job!"

Shanahan, who was confirmed by the Senate in 2017 as deputy defense secretary, can serve in an acting capacity for "an indefinite period of time at the direction and discretion of the president," according to an administration official.

Trump has recently expressed a preference for acting Cabinet members, who can be replaced whenever he wants, without the stigma of a firing and the bad press that goes with it.

"I like 'acting.' It gives me more flexibility," Trump said when asked about the high number of positions filled by acting secretaries.

But perhaps Shanahan's most endearing quality is his disinclination to push back against Trump's whims, which can sometimes seem to come out of left field and flout conventional military advice.

When Trump grew frustrated with the Mattis Pentagon slow-rolling his idea to create a Space Force as a separate military service, Shanahan stepped up and saluted smartly, famously telling Pentagon officials, "We are not the Department of No."

Shanahan became the champion of Space Force and headed the team that has drawn up a plan to submit to Congress this year.

That unquestioning subservience was also on display in his first Cabinet meeting, in which Shanahan was seated to the president's immediate left.

When Trump asked him to say a few words about the need for the military to help build a border wall, Shanahan didn't flinch.

"The Army Corps of Engineers is dialed in on doing this cost-effectively, quickly, and with the right amount of urgency as to where we can build additional stand-up walls quickly," Shanahan said while the TV cameras rolled. "The threat is real. The risks are real. We need to control our borders."

It was another contrast to Mattis, who was known to often sidestep direct support of Trump's controversial polices and tended to praise his troops more than his commander in chief.

Shanahan is as smart as they come, with two advanced degrees from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in mechanical engineering and business.

And he's well-aware that the president already has plenty of advisers telling him things he doesn't want to hear.

Trump has pronounced Shanahan "a pleasure to work with," and that could be his ticket to acting as defense secretary for the next two years.

Texto completo: Even those of us too young to remember Jan. 12, 1969 - which is most of us - know the basics: The Jets were huge underdogs against the Colts in Super Bowl III, and their 16-7 victory 50 years ago Saturday stunned the football world.
But this is the rare case in which an old tale has not grown taller over time. If anything, a review of what people were saying and writing before the game reveals a shocker befitting its reputation.
Joe Falls of the Detroit Free Press predicted the Colts would win 270-0, adding of Joe Namath: "He'd better grow that mustache again and that goatee and those sideburns because they're going to rearrange his face in Miami on Jan. 12."
He added that the Orange Bowl would need more than a scoreboard that day: "They'll need a computer to keep up with the Colts."
To be fair, Falls was typing in the press box in Cleveland after watching the Colts crush the Browns, 34-0, in the NFL Championship Game, avenging their only loss of the season.
Even reporters who knew how good the Jets were seemed awed by the challenge.
In the very Newsday story in which he reported on Namath's famous guarantee that the Jets would win, beat reporter George Usher called the Colts "the awesome National Football League champions."
He added, "The Colts will most likely cut off the running game as quickly and as efficiently as a guillotine." (The Jets' Matt Snell ran for 121 yards and a touchdown that day.)
Usher was one of two Newsday writers among the five nationally who went out on a limb in their predictions and took the Jets, joining columnist Stan Isaacs. Their colleague, Dick Clemente, had it 27-0 for the Colts.
"Baltimore's front four, incensed at Namath's antics and remarks during the week, has secretly pledged to make Broadway Joe an older, sadder and wiser young man," Clemente wrote.
Isaacs called Colts defensive end Bubba Smith "the greatest thing since peanut butter" and wrote an entire column in which he imagined an interviewer asking questions of David after his big upset of Goliath.
The point spread approached three touchdowns, but perhaps even more startling was that famed bookmaker Jimmy "The Greek" Snyder declared the Colts 7-1 favorites to win outright.
"The Colts have the greatest defensive team in football history," Snyder told The New York Times.
(The Colts allowed 10 or fewer points in 11 of their 14 victories leading up to the Super Bowl.)
The Jets were quietly confident after a 27-23 victory over the Raiders in the AFL title game, but coach Weeb Ewbank played along with the narrative.
Upon arriving in Florida, he cracked, "We didn't show our men the movies [of the Colts]. I'm afraid I'd have trouble getting them on the airplane."
Namath did not play along. His guarantee was not even the most outrageous thing he said before the game, by the standards of 21st century hot-take social-media fallout.
On the charter flight to Florida, the Times' Dave Anderson sat next to Namath, who listed for him five quarterbacks in the 10-team AFL better than the Colts' Earl Morrall. Among them was Namath's 38-year-old backup, Babe Parilli.
(There are reasons that reporters no longer fly on team charters.)
The Colts were unamused. Said defensive lineman Billy Ray Smith: "I think Namath ought to keep his mouth shut. He'll keep his teeth longer."
The best thing about time travel is observing people who do not know what is ahead, even though you do. But by early evening on Jan. 12, everyone knew, and football never was the same.
After back-to-back blowouts by the Packers, the Super Bowl was validated as a competitive enterprise.
"Because of what Joe Namath accomplished in the Super Bowl yesterday, pro football will never quite be the same again," William Wallace wrote in the Times.
(By the way, no one called Super Bowl III "Super Bowl III" at the time. The Roman numerals gimmick came along two years later.)
Isaacs called Namath's performance "one of the most cocky and daring personal triumphs of this sporting time."
The AFL-NFL merger already was in the works for the 1970 season, but the Jets' victory, followed the next year by the Chiefs' upset of the Vikings, went a long way toward ensuring public acceptance.
In Usher's lead paragraph in Monday's Newsday, he quoted a "well-dressed woman" shouting assorted obscenities at media members, most of whom had doubted that the men in white had a chance.
"Now what do you SOBs think?" she said.
Namath himself could not have said it any better.

Texto completo: For the Monitor
As progressive Democrat torch-bearer Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts makes her first trip to New Hampshire this weekend, some of Bernie Sanders's 2016 backers will be holding meetings in the Granite State to encourage the independent senator from Vermont to launch a second presidential bid.
But before he decides on another run for the Democratic presidential nomination, some of his top supporters say he needs to clear the air on a sexual harassment controversy within his 2016 White House campaign.
The allegations of harassment and sexism in Sanders's campaign – which were first reported last week by the New York Times and Politico – are raising new questions even among some of Sanders's strongest supporters.
“My initial allegiance is to Sen. Sanders. I remain a member of the steering committee,” Executive Councilor Andru Volinsky told the Monitor.
“But there were serious concerns raised in the recent letter of harassment and discrimination and I'd like to see a complete and detailed response before fully committing to going forward with the Senator,” Volinsky added.
The Concord resident served as legal counsel for Sanders's 2016 primary campaign in New Hampshire and as a delegate to the 2016 Democratic convention in Philadelphia.
Longtime state Sen. Martha Fuller Clark – vice chairwoman of the New Hampshire Democratic Party – was also Sanders's delegate at the 2016 convention.
“This is a new era in terms of women's leadership roles in so many different areas, including politics. I would hope that if Bernie does decide to run again, that he would make sure that his campaign was run differently,” Fuller Clark said.
Former state Sen. Burt Cohen, another New Hampshire Sanders delegate at the 2016 convention, agreed that “the problem has to be dealt with and rectified.”
Allegations of sexism briefly surfaced during Sanders's 2016 White House bid, but the stories didn't seriously impact his bid for the Democratic nomination against eventual nominee Hillary Clinton. But that was well before the #MeToo movement.
Reports of the controversy surfaced after former staffers and supporters shared stories in recent weeks – through email and online comments – of sexual harassment and pay disparity for women during the 2016 campaign.
Sanders said in a CNN interview last week that, “I certainly apologize to any woman who felt she was not treated appropriately, and of course if I run we will do better the next time.”
When asked if he knew about complaints from his female staffers, he answered “I was a little bit busy running around the country trying to make the case.”
Some leading Sanders supporters in New Hampshire told the Monitor that the allegations in recent weeks were directed more at Sanders's 2016 campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, rather than at the candidate himself.
On Wednesday, CNN and Politico reported that Weaver wouldn't steer the campaign again if the Vermont senator does launch another White House bid.
New Hampshire Democratic Party vice chairwoman Mo Baxley called the news a relief.
“I think it's a big step in the right direction and I want to see further steps,” added Baxley, a member of the Sanders's Granite State steering committee of top supporters.
Urging Bernie to run
On Saturday, Sanders supporters in the Granite State and across the country will be gathering in groups to encourage the senator to run again.
Nationally, the meetings are being organized by a relatively new PAC named “Organizing for Bernie.” The group, which is not associated with the senator, is headed by Rich Pelletier, a 2016 Sanders campaign aide.
In New Hampshire, meetings are scheduled for Concord and Nashua. Baxley is organizing the Concord gathering. She told the Monitor that the mission of the gatherings are two-fold.
“One is to convince Bernie to run again, but two it's to start building the infrastructure so that if the senator announces, there's already a structure in place ready to hit the ground running,” she explained.
The meetings were planned before Wednesday's announcement that Warren would be visiting New Hampshire on Saturday, the same day of Sanders gatherings.
Separately, the pro-Sanders group “Our Revolution” is planning upcoming events as part of its effort to encourage the senator to launch a second presidential campaign.
‘Fair shake'?
We're learning more about Washington State Gov. Jay Inslee's upcoming trip to the first-in-the-nation primary state. The potential Democratic presidential contender will speak to Granite State college students about climate change.
Inslee will address students at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at Saint Anselm College at 8:30 a.m. on Jan. 22, followed by a 1 p.m. speech at Dartmouth College.
“The science is clear. We have a short period of time to act. And whether we shrink from this challenge of defeating climate change, or rise to it, is the biggest question we face, as a nation and as a people,” said Inslee, who's long advocated for a stiffer response to battling climate change.
As previously reported, Inslee will be in Concord the previous day, Jan. 21, to headline an event for the League of Conservation Voters that will be held at the home of former congressman Paul Hodes.
Inslee chaired the Democratic Governors Association during the 2018 election cycle. He visited New Hampshire just days after former state Sen. Molly Kelly won the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in the state's Sept. 11 primary, teaming up with Kelly at multiple events.
But the DGA ended up not putting any money into the New Hampshire gubernatorial showdown, while the rival Republican Governor's Association showered some $300,000 into the race in the closing days, in support of GOP incumbent Gov. Chris Sununu.
At the time, an internal Democratic poll suggested Sununu's lead had dropped to a single point. The Republican governor ended up defeated Kelly by a 53 percent to 46 percent margin.
When the news broke last week that Inslee was coming to New Hampshire, longtime state Democratic Party chairman Ray Buckley – in a rare move – appeared critical of a potential White House hopeful, telling the Monitor and WMUR, “I look forward to hearing from Gov. Inslee his reasons for abandoning New Hampshire in 2018 as chair of the DGA.”
Asked Thursday about his earlier comment, Buckley said, “I just said I look forward to having a conversation with him. That's not criticizing somebody.”
Buckley reiterated that he thinks Inslee has some explaining to do.
“If you're thinking about running for president and you have the ability to allocate funds and you choose not to allocate funds in New Hampshire when we had a winnable race, I think it's a legitimate question,” Buckley said.
“I'm sure he has a good answer. I'll ask him the question, he'll give me the answer and we'll move on,” Buckley concluded.
The chairman said there will be a level playing field in New Hampshire for all 2020 Democratic contenders and added that “of course” Inslee will get a fair shake.
In a move toward running for president, Inslee last month formed a political action committee named the Vision PAC. An announcement of a presidential exploratory committee could be imminent.
 Yang making good on $1,000 per month offer
Warren won't betheonly Democratic presidential contender in New Hampshire this weekend. Andrew Yang will be in the state Friday, making multiple stops in Concord and Manchester.
Yang – a longshot for the nomination who declared his candidacy last year – was the CEO of the test-prep education company Manhattan GMAT before launching Venture for America, a New York City-headquartered organization that trains entrepreneurs.
Last year, Yang announced that he would personally give a Granite Stater $1,000 each month in 2019 to illustrate his campaign pledge to pay what he calls a “freedom dividend” to all adult Americans.
Yang kicks off his trip with a stop at the Goffstown home of the Fassis, the family selected to receive the candidate's “freedom dividend.”

Texto completo: The Other Side of Drug Patents
AS A MEMBER of the medical community, I found the op-ed by Peter Rheinstein exceptionally one-sided and candidly profit-motivated ("Ignoring Drug Patents Puts Lives of Patients at Risk," Jan. 3). The health care system in this country is so fragmented that greed in the shape of soaring drug prices can be disguised as entrepreneurial rights.
There is no question about the contribution of pharmaceutical research. However, Americans who require the new approaches that may drive innovation worthy of the investors' risk-taking seem to be bearing the larger burden of underwriting the costs of development with escalating costs.
Perhaps one way to control for this and to make it more equitable is to give our representative government permission to negotiate better deals for marketed medications. A more balanced point-counterpoint set of opinion pieces would have better served your readership in this instance.
Robert E. Wenger | Doylestown
Look Out for the Clear Threat
The juxtaposition of Editor-in-Chief Joshua Runyan's column regarding not unnecessarily alarming the masses when it comes to rumored anti-Semitism and Rabbi Neil Cooper's op-ed concerning the need to do something about hostility to Jews and Israel warrants some real thought by our community ("The Mail, and Other Worries," "Today, We Can and Should Do Something About Anti-Semitism," Dec. 27).
Runyan seems to be suggesting that many of us are sometimes too quick to respond to perceived anti-Semitism, while Cooper calls for heightened responses when Israel is portrayed unfairly. I find the rabbi's suggestion that a New York Times columnist who wrote an overly critical piece about Israel be "held accountable" extremely frightening, echoing President Trump's war on journalists that anger him.
Cooper's suggestion that Professor Marc Hill is wrongly "protected by the concept of academic freedoms" is equally troubling. As the rabbi must surely know, academic freedom protects the right of a member of the academy to teach even absolute nonsense. We don't really know if Hill understood the intent of the slogan "free Palestine from the river to the sea," but even if he supports the outrageous and naive idea that there should be one predominantly Muslim state in the land of Israel, this should not warrant dismissal from his teaching duties.
Keep in mind that Hill's remarks were not in the context of his teaching. As a former teacher and university instructor, the idea that I could have disciplined for making mean-spirited and absurd comments outside of the classroom is absolutely chilling.
Furthermore, while Cooper rightly notes that instances of anti-Semitism have increased in the last several years, he chooses to conflate negative expressions and criticisms of Israel from the left with much more virulent actions from the right. While Muslim members of Congress want to punish Israel for policies that they believe are harmful to Palestinians, the attack on Jews at prayer in Pittsburgh came from a right-wing extremist.
I am much more concerned about anti-Jewish expressions targeting journalists and anti-Jewish violence than anything a Temple University professor or a Jewish columnist might say. I fully agree with Cooper that we do something about anti-Semitism, we just seem to disagree about where the most dangerous threat comes from.

Texto completo: "January is normally a slow month, but with the shutdown, it's double. We're struggling to hold onto our employees."
Mary Alvarez Nordstrom Rack manager
Mike Yohannes has run a food stand in downtown Washington for the past 20 years, surviving economic downturns while selling hot dogs, candy bars and an assortment of other edible items. But the latest government shutdown could be the death knell for his business.
With foot traffic markedly down at the corner of Pennsylvania Avenue and 11th Street where he operates, Yohannes said sales have fallen about 60 percent during the closure, which has affected nearby federal offices, museums and other tourist spots.
"Business is very, very bad," said Johannes, adding that he pays about $525 in license and other fees every three months, besides food costs. "If it continues like this another two, three months, I'm looking at another job."
While President Donald Trump and Democratic congressional leaders continue to haggle over his demand for $5.7 billion to fund a southern border wall, with both sides going on national TV to make their case Tuesday night, millions of Americans increasingly feel the impact of the impasse.
The effects are especially detrimental to the folks in the area around Yohannes' stand, where merchants have been hammered by the partial shutdown.
Within a few blocks are the headquarters of the Internal Revenue Service and the Commerce and Justice departments, which have furloughed tens of thousands of federal employees or required many to work without pay.
At Nordstrom Rack on E Street, 10 or more customers are typically lined up at the checkout register around midday as federal workers stop in during their lunch hour. There was no line Tuesday, and manager Mary Alvarez said a drop in sales of roughly 25 percent during the closure has forced the layoff of five or six workers.
"January is normally a slow month, but with the shutdown, it's double," Alvarez says. "We're struggling to hold onto our employees."
Several blocks away, the Eye Street Grill shares a building with the Federal Aviation Administration, which has furloughed about 18,000 nonessential employees since Dec. 22. Restaurant owners Yang Soon Kim and husband Il hawn Kim were already reeling from the usual holiday slowdown, but the minimal traffic at the usually bustling buffet line for breakfast and lunch heightened their concerns.
They're thankful the Department of Veterans Affairs across the street remains open.
"If the VA closed, we'd be almost dead," she said.
Outside the nation's capital, the shutdown's most obvious impact has come in the form of trash pile ups and overflowing toilets at national parks, where bathrooms have been closed and garbage is not getting picked up. On Tuesday, Joshua Tree National Park in California said it would close down Thursday morning to address maintenance issues.
Longer security lines are also cropping up at airports hampered by record numbers of Transportation Security Administration employees calling in sick.
Averting a massive outcry, the Trump administration announced Monday that tax refunds would be issued even if the shutdown lasts into the filing season, which this year begins Jan. 28.
Still, federal employees are scheduled to begin missing paychecks this week, prompting House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., to say of the closure, "In another context we would call that an act of kidnapping or terrorism. ... This is devastating to morale and devastating to efficiency."
Other residents throughout the country are feeling the impact in a number of ways, with the departments of Agriculture, Homeland Security, Transportation, Justice, Interior, State, Commerce and Housing and Urban Development temporarily closing their doors.
Here are some of the effects:
Accidents like last week's horrific crash in Florida that killed seven people – five of them children on the way to Disney World – are not being investigated by the National Transportation Safety Board, whose employees are mostly on furlough.
Accident investigators rely on the NTSB's reconstruction efforts to pinpoint the cause, and those findings are used to recommend safety improvements on the nation's highways.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture will delay the release of crucial crop reports that investors and farmers rely on to get a sense for how the agricultural market will look in the coming season.
The USDA also runs the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, and there was concern the benefit commonly known as food stamps would be affected by the shutdown, but the agency announced on Tuesday that the 44 million recipients could count on them at least through February.
Members of Native American tribes may have their health care and education programs threatened by the shutdown. Those services were guaranteed by the federal government as part of treaties in exchange for large extensions of land, but The New York Times reports the Bureau of Indian Affairs was furloughing 2,295 of its 4,057 employees, curtailing service.
The Smithsonian Institution, which welcomed 30 million visitors in 2017 and includes the National Zoo in Washington, has temporarily closed.
The courts that review the cases of undocumented immigrants will see their backlog increase because more than 300 judges have been furloughed. Current cases of detained immigrants will continue as scheduled, but future ones will be delayed, possibly for years.
With access to national parks curtailed, dozens of weddings planned for those sites have had to be relocated or rescheduled.
Fans of creative craft beers will have to settle for their current choices for a while, because the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau has ceased operations during the shutdown, meaning no new labels will get approved until the folks in Washington reach a deal.
Could a new beer summit be in the offing? Don't hold your breath.

Texto completo: How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Li Yuan, a technology columnist in Hong Kong, discussed the tech she's using.
You write about Chinese tech. What tech tools do you rely on to do your job, and what do you like about them?
It's not an exaggeration to say I live in and work on WeChat, the messaging app that's the equivalent of WhatsApp plus Facebook plus PayPal plus Uber plus GrubHub plus many other things. As my iPhone battery use record shows, I spend about one-third of my daily nine-hour phone time on WeChat. That doesn't include the two to three hours I use WeChat's web version.
I'm not alone in my heavy WeChat use. There are 800 million internet users in China, but over one billion WeChat accounts. Just about every Chinese online has at least one account, and some more than one. Over one-third of them spend four hours or more on the app each day. The prevalence has made WeChat an indispensable part of many people's lives and work. Two years ago, I met two people who refused to use WeChat, and I thought about writing a story about how people like them navigated work and life. Before I got around to it, both became my WeChat friends.
So as a journalist, I have to hang out on WeChat. I message and call my sources on WeChat. I keep an eye on WeChat Moment, which is similar to Facebook Timeline, and group chats so I'll always be on top of what's going on in China. When others pretend they are too busy to get back to me, I comment on their Moment posts and group chats to tell them that I know they aren't so busy.
By now, some readers must be screaming, "How about the censorship and government surveillance on WeChat?" Sadly, it's just the way of life in China. I'm not trying to make light of the issue. I've been very critical of how the tech companies work with the government to censor and monitor the Chinese public. But the reality is that ordinary Chinese often feel powerless and fatalistic when it comes to censorship and surveillance.
I've tried to persuade people to get on encrypted messaging apps such as Signal and WhatsApp but haven't had much success.
I also use Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter. I used to be an active Weibo user and still have a few million followers there. But after the government cracked down on Weibo a few years ago and shut down many of the most provocative and influential accounts, I don't use it too often because the conversations are often dominated by celebrity news instead of discussions of current affairs.
But Weibo is still a good place to check out the hottest topics and trends. That's where I found people to talk to for a column I wrote about the generation that grew up without Google, Facebook or Twitter.
How do people in China use tech differently, compared with people in the United States?
The first thing many visitors to China notice is how mobile the Chinese are. Many Chinese never owned a laptop or a PC, and their first computer was their smartphone. Email never really took off in China. Some big corporations do use it. But people usually resort to WeChat for a quick response.
Because of WeChat's prevalence, few Chinese carry business cards any more. At many meetings in China, there's a time when everybody takes out his or her phone and scans the WeChat QR codes of others to become "friends." I personally like having contacts on WeChat rather than on business cards. Because it's a social media platform, you learn about your contacts as individuals beyond their business titles.
Many businesspeople I know have two or more WeChat accounts because WeChat allows only 5,000 contacts for one account. A young venture capitalist told me that it had taken him only two years to reach the limit. I don't know how they manage so many contacts.
Generally, Chinese are more receptive to new things and more tolerant of imperfect products, including mobile apps. Some commentators here say Facebook is almost a Chinese company because of its "move fast and break things" mantra. Many people in China's internet industry work super-long hours to make sure they beat competitors to roll out new features first.
Why are mobile wallets so popular in China?
When I moved from New York to Beijing in 2008, China was still a cash-based nation. Not many people had credit cards, and it wasn't easy for small businesses to get approval to install the machines. I used to have to go to the A.T.M.s all the time. Going to the banks, mostly giant state-owned enterprises, was torturously time-consuming.
Then came WeChat Pay and Alipay, the mobile payment services from Tencent and Alibaba. Since so many Chinese were already on WeChat and were trained to scan QR codes, it took the two giants only some cash-bonus campaigns at grocery stores to convert people like my mom to mobile payments.
Mobile pay is now available in almost every place I visit in China, including small towns. I've been carrying a 100-yuan ($15) bill in my wallet for months but haven't found an occasion to use it. Everybody -- hotels, department stores, taxi drivers, noodle stands -- takes Alipay or WeChat Pay or both. Even tollbooths accept mobile payment.
What are some hot new apps, tech products or internet services in China?
The hottest app is a short video service, Douyin, which is called TikTok outside China. As my colleague Kevin Roose aptly put it in a recent column, it's "a quirky hybrid of Snapchat, the defunct video app Vine and the TV segment 'Carpool Karaoke."'
To be honest, I'm too old for the app -- Douyin targets urban teenagers and 20-somethings -- and have not spent much time on it. But I've seen some viral Douyin videos on Weibo and WeChat that are fun and goofy. Some young Chinese told me that they spend hours watching Douyin videos every day, which I would argue is the downside of the app. Its parent company, Bytedance, is very good at using artificial intelligence to push content based on users' viewing history.
The short video app that I check out from time to time is Douyin's rival, Kwai. Kwai is popular in small towns and the countryside. You can watch young people chasing geese and getting married in white gowns in front of mud houses. I call Kwai the "Hillbilly Elegy" of China. It's where you can get a flavor of what China is like outside the biggest coastal cities.
Outside of work, what tech product are you into right now?
I'm a very low-tech person! While my iPhone feels like an extension of my left arm, I don't use many other electronics. I didn't own a TV until a year ago and only watch Netflix sometimes. I bought a microwave this year, and it's the simplest model because I knew I would use it only to reheat food.
My biggest tech wish is for Google, Facebook, Apple or another company to build a technology that can break the Great Firewall, the system of filters and blocks that prevents Chinese from visiting thousands of foreign websites. Instead of kowtowing to the Chinese government's demands in order to gain access to the market, American tech giants could do something heroic: Liberate hundreds of millions of people from information darkness.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: LONDON -- "The Favourite," a dark comedy about palace scheming under Queen Anne in 18th-century Britain, received 12 nominations on Wednesday for the EE British Academy Film Awards, five more than any other film.
Its nominations for the British equivalent of the Oscars, commonly known as the Baftas, include best film. It will compete for that prize against "Roma," "A Star Is Born," "BlacKkKlansman" and "Green Book."
"Green Book," a critically divisive road movie about race relations, was the surprise winner at the Golden Globe Awards on Sunday, winning best picture for a musical or comedy.
"The Favourite" received rave reviews on its release in Britain and its three stars, Olivia Colman, Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz, all received nominations as did the director, Yorgos Lanthimos. Colman won the Golden Globe for best actress in a musical or comedy, one of the film's five nominations.
[Read The New York Times's review of "The Favourite."]
Colman, who plays Queen Anne in the film, faces competition for best leading actress from Lady Gaga for "A Star Is Born," Glenn Close for "The Wife," Viola Davis for "Widows" and Melissa McCarthy for "Can You Ever Forgive Me?"
"Bohemian Rhapsody," the biopic about Freddie Mercury of the rock band Queen that won best drama at the Golden Globes, received seven Bafta nominations, including Rami Malek for best leading actor. The other nominees for best actor are Bradley Cooper for "A Star Is Born," Christian Bale for "Vice," Viggo Mortensen for "Green Book" and Steve Coogan for "Stan & Ollie."
Alfonso Cuarón is nominated for best director for "Roma," a category he won at the Golden Globes. He will compete against Lanthimos, Spike Lee ("BlacKkKlansman"), Bradley Cooper ("A Star Is Born") and the Polish director Pawel Pawlikowski, whose film "Cold War," about a torrid love affair across borders after World War II, has been a hit in Europe.
The Baftas are often considered a rough bellwether for the Academy Awards because there is some overlap between the 6,500 voting members of the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, which hosts the Baftas, and the members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences who vote for the Oscars.
Last year, Guillermo del Toro was named best director at the Baftas for "The Shape of Water" before winning the same award at the Oscars. Gary Oldman also won best actor at both ceremonies, for his portrayal of Winston Churchill in "Darkest Hour," while Frances McDormand won best actress at both for her role in "Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri."
The winners of this year's Baftas will be announced on Feb. 10 at a ceremony at the Royal Albert Hall in London. Joanna Lumley, the British actress and activist, will host for the second consecutive year.

GREED'S ON THE LOOSE ONCE AGAIN; PLAIN TALK

Texto completo: Guess what? Remember all those financial tricks the money changers played during George W. Bush's terms in office? Don't look now, but they're back.
As hard as it is to believe one could overlook the financial tricks and risky mortgage practices that contributed mightily to the nation's economic meltdown roughly 10 years ago, many of the big investment houses and Wall Street opportunists are acting like nothing happened.
According to a report as far back as March 2017, USA Today business columnist Paul Davidson warned that riskier borrowers are making up a growing share of new mortgages, modestly pushing up delinquencies and raising concerns about an eventual spike in defaults that could slow or derail the housing recovery.
Davidson said that trend is particularly evident in home loans guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration, which typically require down payments of just 3 to 5 percent. He added that those loans are increasingly being offered by non-bank lenders who have more lenient credit standards than banks.
In October 2018 there was more evidence that the tactics that kindled the meltdown a decade ago were making a comeback. A similar kind of investment that was prevalent during the meltdown appears to be back in vogue, a report in the New York Times' business section said. CLOs, short for collateralized loan obligations, are being sold to risky borrowers while lending standards are being dropped and regulators once again are looking the other way.
Top Federal Reserve policymakers began warning about CLOs, describing them as eerily resembling the "sliced and diced" securities that brought the American economy to its knees in '07 and '08, destroying the fortunes of millions of Americans and setting records in mortgage foreclosures.
Then in December, a New York Times piece by Paul Sullivan reported that housing lenders, squeezed by rising interest rates and fewer houses on the market, are starting to push loans on borrowers, who are using them to get into more expensive homes that they otherwise might not be able to afford.
One popular loan, Sullivan wrote, is the interest- only adjustable rate mortgage, with which a borrower pays only the interest for a period of time before the rate resets and principal becomes part of the payment. This may be just fine for a wealthy borrower, but the not-so-wealthy aren't as lucky. They can qualify for the adjustable rate mortgage now, but when the loan resets with a new interest rate and higher payments for principal, many of them will start struggling to stay above water.
The mortgage lenders respond that there's nothing to worry about.
For instance, Quicken Loans, one of the largest FHA lenders, claims that all the concerns are overwrought. The financial landscape is much different than the mid-2000s when sub-prime mortgages were approved without verification of buyers' income or assets. There are much stricter rules now on how mortgages can be bundled and sold and everything and everyone are safe.
Let's remember, though, that we've been sold that song and dance before many times before.
There have been several financial meltdowns in America's economic history. They all seem to occur during halcyon days of a booming economy when visions of easy wealth turn business sense into greed. The late 1800s saw their share of busts over grain prices and railroad monopolies, poorly regulated banks and insurance companies. Not too long after, with the stock market setting records and making overnight millionaires, the Great Depression made millions destitute and destroyed countless lives.
Then came the savings and loan scandal of the 1980s, the tech bust of 2000 and the cruel Great Recession a half-decade later.
In their wake, almost all were met with cries for better regulation and more oversight. That did happen for a few years and then big money succeeded in easing those restrictions. Even now, just 10 years after the Great Recession, politicians in bed with their wealthy campaign donors are pushing to weaken the Dodd-Frank safeguards enacted to address the recklessness on Wall Street.
What's so commonplace in all the bubble-bursting is that the ones most responsible seldom suffer. While the money changers get bailouts and fines that amount to wrist slaps, the common folk lose their homes, their jobs and their dignity.
So keep an eye on those reports we're already seeing. Greed always manages to get its way. CREDIT: By Dave Zweifel ; dzweifel@madison.com, 608-252-6410 and on Twitter @ DaveZweifel.

Texto completo: New Stage Theatre, Mississippi's professional theatre located in Jackson, Mississippi, announces its winter class schedule. The class session begins Jan. 12 and runs through Feb. 26th. New classes are available for first-graders through adults. To register for classes, please contact Education Director Sharon Miles at (601) 948-3533 ext. 232 or smiles@newstagetheatre.com.
For our first-grade through third-grade students, our Story Theatre series presents Sneetches by Dr. Seuss. The Sneetches live on the beach and there is a line drawn in the sand: Star Bellies on one side, Plain Bellies on the other. Star-bellied Sneetches are part of the "popular crowd", while plain-bellied Sneetches are shunned. Will the arrival of Sylvester McMonkey McBean and his "fix it machine" help or harm this divided community? This is the story of Dr. Seuss' powerful parable about the surface things that divide us, it will take a courageous friendship between an unlikely pair of Sneetches to find the answers. Students will be guided through the building blocks of theatre technique by building a script from scratch. We will work on character development, acting technique, and storytelling to create a showcase of an original script. This class takes place Saturdays, lasting six weeks total, from Jan. 12 to Feb. 23. Class is from 9: a.m. to 10:30 a.m. The cost of this class is $150.
For our students in fourth-grade, fifth-grade and sixth-grade, our Story Theatre series presents R.J. Palacio's Wonder. August Pullman was born with a facial difference that, up until now, has prevented him from going to a mainstream school. Starting 5th grade at Beecher Prep, he wants nothing more than to be treated as an ordinary kid—but his new classmates can't get past Auggie's extraordinary face. Wonder, now a New York Times bestseller, begins from Auggie's point of view, but soon switches to include his classmates, his sister, her boyfriend, and others. These perspectives converge in a portrait of one community's struggle with empathy, compassion, and acceptance. Students will be guided through the building blocks of theatre technique by building a script from scratch. We will work on character development, acting technique, and storytelling to create a showcase of an original script. This class takes place Saturdays, lasting six weeks total, from January 12 – February 23. Class is from 10:45 am to 12:15 pm. The cost of this class is $150.
We will continue our Monday Night Live! at New Stage series for adults. This is a new program designed to enhance our artistic community by providing quality acting classes for adults taught by local professionals. Included in this series we will offer Advanced Acting with John Maxwell and Voice Over 101 with Keri Grayson Horn. The series takes place Monday nights starting Jan. 21 and ending Feb. 26th.
Advanced Acting with John Maxwell will be from Jan. 2 to Feb. 26 at 6:30 pm to 8:30 pm. This class is $200. This class is designed for actors with some stage experience. Actors should prepare a one-minute monologue for the first session on Jan. 21. Through monologues and some scene work, this class will explore the challenges for every actor in "growing through a role" rather than "finding a role".
It will encourage and nurture the communication skills of an actor rather than the performance skills of an actor. There will be some home-work and possible scene-work with a partner outside of class. Come with the desire to work and learn through collaboration with the instructor.
Voice Over 101 with Keri Grayson Horn will be from Feb. 4 to Feb. 25, at 5:30 p.m. to 7: p.m. This class is $150. This class is designed for anyone interested in learning about the Voice Over industry. Learn vocal techniques, warm-up exercises, microphone etiquette, how to approach the copy (your script), different avenues of Voice Over to explore, where (and where NOT) to go after jobs, and so much more. Then, you'll step up to the mic and try out what you've learned.
New Stage's Youth Acting Troupe will begin again on Jan. 26 for youth ages 12 to 18. This class is $100 per month or $400 per semester. YAT meets once a week on Saturdays from 10:00 am to 12:00 pm. Students will learn about acting through exercises and show rehearsals. This semester they will focus on scene work and a Shakespeare in the Park performance. No audition is necessary to join YAT. Auditions may occur for various projects. There will be an informational meeting on Jan. 12 at 10: a.m.
The education department at New Stage Theatre strives to equip people interested in theatre with the opportunity to develop and strengthen their acting skills, in a professional environment, taught by educated and experienced theatre veterans.
For more information, or to reserve a spot in one of the theatre's exciting acting classes, please contact Education Director Sharon Miles at 601.948.3533 ext. 232, or smiles@newstagetheatre.com.

Texto completo: Dropping Facebook may be tougher than it appears for Samsung smartphone owners.
Bloomberg reported Samsung phone users are unable to delete the Facebook app. Instead, they are only given an option to disable the app on their smartphone.
Among users cited in the report was Nick Winke, a photographer who attempted and failed to delete Facebook's app from his Galaxy S8 smartphone.
"It just absolutely baffles me that if I wanted to completely get rid of Facebook that it essentially would still be on my phone, which brings up more questions," Winke told Bloomberg.
In a statement emailed to USA TODAY, Samsung said select smartphone models carry a pre-loaded Facebook app users can choose to disable. "The app is no longer running when it is disabled," said Samsung.
Facebook could not be immediately reached for comment. In a statement to Bloomberg, Facebook said the disabled version acts as if it's been deleted and doesn't continue to collect data.
Facebook has endured scrutiny over how it handles user data since the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica was accused of improperly accessing Facebook accounts.
Last month, the New York Times reported Facebook offered tech giants such as Netflix and Amazon broader access to user data such as friends' list and private messages without users' permission. Facebook said any features introduced in partnership with companies required users' permission.
Both Spotify and Netflix denied the ability to access Facebook users' private messages.

Keto? Paleo? Whole30?

Texto completo: Depending on who you talk to, dieting is life-changing, terrible for you, optimistic, misguided, will keep you alive or put you in an early grave. Then there's all that lingo that comes with mastering the biological theories behind dieting, like ketosis and alkaline and lectin — phrases that make you feel like you're in a science class rather than just trying to shed a few pounds or live a healthier life. Have no fear, because we've got a simplified guide for you about the trendiest diets going into the new year — that self-conscious time when everyone's re-evaluating their lifestyle. With each diet description is a rating of its effectiveness, done by U.S. News and World Report in August. We've included their findings, based on input from a panel of health experts, on weight loss and healthiness for each diet. While doing this study they took into account the diet being "relatively easy to follow, nutritious, safe, effective for weight loss and protective against diabetes and heart disease." Without further ado, here are the diet trends you're likely to see referenced in celebrity Instagram captions in 2019:
Ketogenic Perhaps the biggest fad that's riding its wave of popularity right into 2019 is the Ketogenic, or "Keto," diet. Celebs like Kourtney Kardashian, Al Roker and Vinny Guadagnino (who affectionately went by the nickname "Keto Guido" on the new seasons of "Jersey Shore") have popularized the diet.
Ketogenic diets are low on carbs and high on fat, which puts the body in a state of ketosis. Ketosis is a metabolic state that happens when your body doesn't have enough carbohydrates for your cells to burn for energy. So instead, it burns fat.
The Keto diet is very effective at slimming your waistline, but does cause huge changes to your body that are not always positive. U.S. News & World Report says that changing the way your body is fueled from carbs to fat can lead to leg cramps, dehydration, brain fog, dizziness and more.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.8/5 Weight Loss | 1.6/5 Healthy
Paleo The philosophy of this diet is in the name. The Paleo diet encourages people to eat foods that would have been available to our Paleolithic ancestors. In case you need to brush up on your high school science, the Paleolithic era started 2.5 million years ago.
Basically, with this diet you're looking at meals that could either be hunted or gathered — lean meats, fish, vegetables, nuts and seeds. And, because farming hadn't been developed yet in the Paleolithic era, Paleo dieters are expected to cut out foods that became popularized through farming like dairy products, legumes and grains, as well. Those who follow the Paleo diet believe that modern eating habits don't suit our prehistoric genetic makeup, so we should return to Stone Age-approved meals.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.5/5 Weight Loss | 2.5/5 Healthy
Alkaline Diet Acid is the enemy of the Alkaline diet. The thought behind this diet is to cut out foods that cause your body to produce acid – including meat, wheat, refined sugar, processed foods, dairy, eggs, canned food, packaged snacks, caffeine and alcohol. You may be thinking: what else is there to eat?
The Alkaline diet approves of most fruits and vegetables, nuts, legumes, soybeans and tofu. These are foods that are alkaline — in other words have a pH value of 7, which is neutral, or above. Foods with a pH value below 7 are acidic, and therefore a no-go.
That said, there is no solid science to support that regulating the pH values of your food will change the overall pH balance of your body. It will do that naturally.
However, in general, eating a lot of fruits and veggies and avoiding processed foods will make you lose weight.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.1/5 Weight Loss | 2.9/5 Healthy
Whole30 A popular diet that spurred a New York Times bestselling book, Whole30 encourages people to eat foods with as few ingredients as possible, and all those ingredients should be substances you know and can pronounce. A head of broccoli? Go for it. A piece of candy made with things like glycerin, citric acid, potassium sorbate, red 40 and soy lecithin? Not so much.
The program's website claims that if you completely avoid foods such as alcohol, anything with added sugar, legumes, dairy and more, for 30 days, you will "eliminate cravings, restore a healthy metabolism, heal the digestive tract, reduce systemic inflammation, and discover how these foods are truly impacting how you look, how you feel, and your quality of life." This program also advocates not stepping on a scale, to make the diet more about health than weight loss.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.3/5 on Weight Loss | 2.4/5 on Healthy
Mediterranean The Mediterranean diet advocates heart-healthy foods that are typically eaten in the Mediterranean. The diet guides people to eat plenty of plants and foods that are low on "bad" cholesterol, such as legumes, nuts, wheat, fruits and veggies. For example, in this diet, you replace butter with healthy fats like olive oil, salt with herbs and spices, and red meat with fish and poultry.
Plus, it totally encourages a glass of red wine every now and then. In essence, you're not avoiding fats and carbs, you're just choosing the healthier versions.
U.S. News & World Report: 3.0/5 on Weight loss | 4.8/5 on Healthy
Flexitarian Think of the Flexitarian diet as vegetarian with a lot of cheat days. The term applies to people who typically eat meatless but occasionally incorporate meat or fish into their diet. New York Times columnist Mark Bittman (who also wrote "VB6: Eat Vegan Before 6:00") has a big role in popularizing this diet. Bittman, as his book title suggests, advocates eating vegan before 6 p.m.
An easier way to ease into this diet is by doing a few meatless days a week, says Dawn Jackson Blatner, the author of "The Flexitarian Diet" and a registered dietitian, until you reach the top tier, which is five meatless days a week.
U.S. News & World Report: 3.3/5 on Weight loss | 4.6/5 on Healthy
Lectin-free We can trace the popularity of this diet back to Kelly Clarkson's praise of "The Plant Paradox Cookbook" by Dr. Steve Gundry.
She said this book helped her achieve her recent weight loss. Gundry has a long, science-fiction-esque explanation about why plants high in lectins (a kind of protein) like beans, legumes and whole grains are bad for you. An extraordinarily simplified version of his theory is that lectins in the plants cause confusion in the immune system and inflammation.
An extraordinarily dramatized version of his theory is that plants are waging war against us so we don't eat them and we're too dumb to adjust our diets. It's true lectins can be toxic in some cases, but much of Gundry's research is based on inconsistent evidence.

Texto completo: Weeks after Women's March Chicago announced there would be no march in the city this month, a young activist is organizing a rally in the Loop in support of the national movement.
The rally, organized by an activist aligned with Women's March Illinois, is scheduled for 10 a.m. Jan. 19 at Federal Plaza at Adams and Dearborn streets, according to organizers. The event is not associated with Women's March Chicago -- and it's not expected to be as large as prior events.
"This will very much be a more informal rally to just be part of this important day of action," said Mrinalini Chakraborty, a founder of Women's March Illinois.
Chakraborty said organizers don't anticipate the rally being on the scale of past Women's March events in Chicago or other cities. The group is helping connect the lead organizer to volunteers and other Chicago activists. A list of speakers had not been announced as of Tuesday.
Jazmine-Marie Cruz, 19, a freshman at Roosevelt University, is leading efforts to organize the gathering, timed to coincide with events around the country. Cruz started planning the rally, the first she's organized, on Saturday. She started working toward the rally after learning Women's March Chicago wasn't holding a march this year. Cruz said she thought it was important for Chicago to be represented in the national movement.
"The community is so diverse," she said about Chicago. "I want people to be empowered, to feel like there will be change. I think with the government shutdown, people feel powerless."
Cruz, from Kenosha, attended last year's Women's March in Milwaukee and walked away feeling inspired.
"It was so important to me, and I was so inspired by women there," she said.
Cruz has spent the past few days trying to connect with other young activists in Chicago to get support for the rally.
"I want people to see that the next generation is ready and able to continue the fight that so many others started for us," Cruz said. "We are ready to fight for humanity and to fight for equal rights and equal pay and to fight against hate and racial and gender discrimination."
She has identified 10 issues as priorities for those attending the rally, from environmental justice to immigrants' rights.
News of the rally comes weeks after Women's March Chicago announced it would not organize the annual march in January that in the past had drawn thousands of participants to the Loop. Organizers, who are not directly tied to the national organization behind the Women's March, cited high costs as one of the reasons they weren't planning the march this year. The group said much of their resources were used to organize "March to the Polls" in October to spur an uptick in midterm election voting.
Harlene Ellin, a spokeswoman for Women's March Chicago, said organizers have encouraged women to create events to mark the day the national march is taking place. They call the initiative "operation activation," although the group is not formally hosting any event.
"We are calling on Chicago-area women to spearhead or participate in community actions that help other people," Ellin said.
Nationally, Women's March leadership has been rocked by claims of anti-Semitism, in part because of a founder's ties to Louis Farrakhan, whose Chicago-based Nation of Islam has been labeled an anti-Semitic hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.
In New Orleans, organizers in late December announced they were canceling their local Women's March, according to a social media post. Organizers cited a call for leaders of Women's March Inc., to resign as one of the reasons why they weren't moving forward with a local effort. The New York Times reported in December that divisions within the national leadership date back to the start of the marches, when at least one of the organizers expressed concerns about anti-Semitic comments.
Chakraborty said she doesn't see rifts within the movement, and said the topic is much more complex. Women's March Illinois has continued to support the national leadership because of work the organizers have done prior to 2016, Chakraborty said.
"I don't see a division," Chakraborty said. "I see pain, I see questions, I see concerns."
And while a massive march isn't planned for Chicago this time around, Women's March Chicago will follow the efforts of other women's groups across the country ahead of the 2020 presidential election.
"We will be back," Ellin said.

Texto completo: A program that puts police officers in schools is intended to strengthen ties with students, staff and their communities while allaying security concerns.
But the reach of school resource officers, as they are called, has become the focus of heightened concerns, particularly in Suffolk County, as published reports indicate that information-sharing about alleged gang affiliation has put some immigrant students on the road to deportation.
Amid backlash caused by the 2017 detention and 2018 deportation to Honduras of a former student at Huntington High School, the Suffolk County Police Department on Tuesday defended the role those officers play in safeguarding schools, improving community relations and helping students.
In the view of Suffolk Police Commissioner Geraldine Hart, the program needs to continue and grow.
"I can say unequivocally that our school resource officer program is a huge, huge part of our bridge-building with our communities," Hart said.
She said the characterization of those officers as information-gatherers for immigration enforcement is "an extraordinary misrepresentation." They are in the schools, she added, to address myriad issues and foster a safe environment for all students.
A Dec. 27 story in The New York Times Magazine, published in collaboration with ProPublica, reported that the former Huntington High School student, identified as Alex, was suspended from school and eventually arrested and detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement after he was questioned in school about alleged gang-related actions, such as writing the Honduran telephone country code "504" on a calculator case, wearing blue sneakers and drawing a "devil with horns."
The Huntington case resulted from "substantiated information" that was considered by an immigration judge and reaffirmed on appeal, Hart said. "It was not any doodle, or any mascot drawing ... that led to the deportation," she said.
The commissioner plans to meet "in the near future" with superintendents from throughout the county to discuss the program as educators wrestle with the matter. The Nassau County Police Department also employs school resource officers, but its program has not attracted as much scrutiny for immigration cases.
Several hundred school district residents attended a Monday night meeting in Huntington, with many pressing for specific guidelines to limit the program's scope. Dozens more raised questions at a Suffolk police Second Precinct meeting Tuesday morning.
Immigrant activists have been complaining about the dangers of entanglement of law enforcement and schools since the summer of 2017, soon after the launch of Operation Matador - an initiative of the federal Homeland Security Investigations, which operates under ICE to pursue gang members for removal from the country. The push followed a burst of violence by alleged members of the MS-13 gang, but advocates contend immigrant teens were wrongly accused of gang ties.
"They're basically targeting Latino immigrant students," said Osman Canales, a community organizer with the Long Island Immigrant Student Advocates. "The schools need rules, procedures and limits on their relations with the police and what information is being stored. It's not only in Huntington."
Irma Solis, director of the Suffolk County Chapter of the New York Civil Liberties Union, also has called for strict limits to officers' information-gathering and for "restricting the sharing of information directly or indirectly with immigration enforcement."
Despite those concerns, school resource officers have been touted as a vital link between police and schools on Long Island, especially with reassessment of response to threats following the February 2018 school shooting that killed 17 students and staff in Parkland, Florida.
"We found tremendous benefit in the training and experience those officers have ... and we feel not only that the continuation, but the extension of the program is essential," said Elwood schools Superintendent Kenneth Bossert, president of the Suffolk County School Superintendents Association.
The concerns of immigrant students are on the minds of educators as well, he said.
Bossert stated that "information-sharing should only take place as pertinent to maintaining the safety, health and welfare of students, faculty and staff," He add

Texto completo: A spinoff of "The Goldbergs" debuts on ABC. And Rodrigo Cortés's horror film "Down a Dark Hall" is available to stream.
What's on TV
SCHOOLED 8:30 p.m. on ABC. Adam F. Goldberg trades Toto for Nirvana in this spinoff of "The Goldbergs" -- Goldberg's successful sitcom built partly on nostalgia for the 1980s. In "Schooled," he and the writer Marc Firek (both creators of the new show) move a decade ahead to the '90s, where AJ Michalka's character, Lainey -- previously a fashion school dropout with rock singer aspirations -- is beginning a job as a teacher at the prep school she once attended. Tim Meadows's guidance counselor character is now a principal.
THE DICTATOR'S PLAYBOOK 10 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). The first episode of PBS's new documentary series on dictators follows the rise of the North Korean leader Kim Il Sung, who began the Kim dynasty and the Korean War during his reign, from 1945 until he died in 1994. The episode begins with his death, after which, the journalist Jean H. Lee explains, the country was "shocked because they had been raised to think of him as a god; they didn't know that he was even mortal." The program pays special attention to the use of fear, violence and propaganda by several dictators and draws parallels among their tactics; later episodes cover Benito Mussolini, Idi Amin, Saddam Hussein and others.
What's Streaming
DOWN A DARK HALL (2018) on HBO streaming services and Vudu. This oddball horror film from Rodrigo Cortés concerns a teenager (AnnaSophia Robb) who is sent to a boarding school led by a strict headmistress (Uma Thurman). She eventually finds out that the source of creative inspiration at the school stems from the souls of dead artists, who possess young students. In her review for The New York Times, Teo Bugbee wrote that Cortés "approaches the supernatural elements of this thriller with surprising elegance, using the film's sound mix to wring scares from shrouded horrors." She called the movie "genuinely strange."
THE COMMUTER (2018) on Hulu. The first thing you should know about this Jaume Collet-Serra-directed action movie is that it stars Liam Neeson as a middle-aged former cop. You can probably fill in some of the blanks: Neeson's character sees his life of suburban contentment shattered, in this case after a mysterious woman, Joanna (Vera Farmiga), offers him $100,000 to identify another passenger on his commuter train. Punches are thrown. Neeson's suit stays in one piece when you think it shouldn't. But in his review for The Times, A. O. Scott wrote that the film's first act holds some tonal surprises. "Until the particulars of Joanna's scheme start to reveal themselves -- roughly until the first fight sequence -- Mr. Collet-Serra cultivates a clammy, hallucinatory, Hitchcockian vibe," he said. After the movie settles into more standard action fare, viewers who have ridden the Metro-North Railroad can enjoy seeing familiar train cars repurposed as an arena for human punching bags.

Planned Parenthood finally admits abortion is its 'core mission'

Texto completo: Planned Parenthood wants you to think it only kills babies occasionally.

It has pointed to its own dubious accounting to claim that abortion makes up just 3 percent of the services it provides, as if snuffing out the lives of unborn children sporadically somehow makes it more excusable morally.

But the truth is bad for the abortion business.

For years, it has guarded the 3 percent figure jealously, and a complicit press has reprinted it uncritically. Its former president, Cecile Richards, repeated it during congressional testimony. Journalists at CNN, Politico, and the New York Times publish it without qualification. It's repeated so often, it has become an ironclad lie.

Unraveling the truth would be a disaster for Planned Parenthood. Congress might not write it as many taxpayer checks if the public learned that the largest abortion provider does, in fact, make its money by performing abortions — 328,348 abortions a year, according to its latest annual report.

A recent statement from current Planned Parenthood President Leanna Wen comes as a surprise, then.

Wen found the idea that her organization plans to focus on nonabortion services, the thesis of a recent BuzzFeed profile, offensive. She said the opposite. She screwed up monumentally.

“Our core mission is providing, protecting and expanding access to abortion and reproductive health care,” Wen tweeted. “We will never back down from that fight - it’s a fundamental human right and women’s lives are at stake.”

This is a landmark moment of honesty. If Wen can tell the truth about her abortion corporation, then maybe Planned Parenthood can finally do away with the 3 percent fabrication. Even though it has a free pass in the halls of Congress, the lie really is laughably false.

It requires truly crooked accounting. As Rich Lowry of National Review explains, Planned Parenthood arrives at the 3 percent figure by counting abortion like any other service. By its books, an abortion is the same as a simple pregnancy test or a quick STD screen. Count them all up, divide the number of abortions by the total number of other services, and voila: Planned Parenthood can say abortion is just a small part of what it does.

Not everyone has been fooled, not even more liberal outlets who might be more sympathetic. The fact checker at the Washington Post ran the numbers and found the 3 percent statistic “misleading.” She gave it three Pinocchios. Writing at Slate in May 2013, Rachel Larimore was similarly unimpressed. She called it “the most meaningless statistic ever.”

Now it seems that even Planned Parenthood agrees. Wen said as much. Abortion, it’s what they do. It is “their core mission.” So can we dismiss the 3 percent fantasy once and for all?

Texto completo: DAKAR, Senegal -- The Nigerian military stormed the headquarters and three satellite offices of one of the nation's largest newspapers on Sunday, detaining at least two journalists and seizing computers, phones and other equipment.
The military released a statement calling its actions an "invitation" to talk to staff about a lead article on Sunday in the newspaper, Daily Trust, about a planned military operation in the town of Baga, that it said had divulged classified information, "thus undermining national security."
The Sunday edition also included an editorial criticizing the military for its lack of progress fighting Boko Haram, the Islamist terrorist group that has unleashed violence in the northeast of the country for nearly a decade.
The military raid came less than two months before scheduled presidential elections in Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, and after a series of stinging losses in the war with Boko Haram.
Soldiers arrived Sunday afternoon at the Daily Trust office in Maiduguri, where Boko Haram was founded, and rounded up two journalists working there, Uthman Abubakar, a regional editor, and Ibrahim Sawab, a reporter who has worked in the past for The New York Times. The men were detained in a military barracks.
Mr. Sawab was released several hours later, but Mr. Abubakar remained in custody on Monday, colleagues said.
Later Sunday afternoon, armed soldiers in five vehicles stormed the paper's main office in the capital, Abuja, and ordered journalists working inside to evacuate. They occupied the building for four hours, according to Mannir Dan-Ali, the paper's editor in chief, ransacking the newsroom and carting away dozens of computers. Soldiers also entered the newspaper's offices in Lagos and Kaduna.
Their actions "strangulated the production of the Monday edition of the paper," Mr. Dan-Ali said.
President Muhammadu Buhari, who is running for re-election next month, made big gains against Boko Haram when he first took office in 2015, but some of that success has slipped away in recent months, as the group has carried out a series of successful attacks against the military. Boko Haram fighters have killed dozens of soldiers, even posting online a gruesome video of one attack, and rumors have circulated that they once again control some territory in the country's northeast.
Soldiers have complained about long tours of duty that have left them with no days off for months, worn-out equipment and low rations, according to local news reports. The military has disputed all such claims.
Late Sunday, Mr. Buhari ordered soldiers out of Daily Trust offices, saying issues between the military and newspaper "will be resolved through dialogue."
In its statement, the military said, "The Nigerian Army has no intention of muzzling the press or jeopardizing press freedom." It added that the military would "not tolerate a situation where a publication would consistently side with terrorists and undermine our national institutions."
The action was criticized by the Committee to Protect Journalists and by Amnesty International, which has also faced criticism by the military after releasing reports of human rights abuses by soldiers.
Soldiers shot and killed dozens of unarmed protesters from a minority Muslim religious group, and the military lashed out at Unicef, briefly ordering the group out of the country before relenting. Soldiers were angry about a training program by the aid group that aimed to teach people to spot and report military abuses.
The raids on Sunday seemed to be an escalation of the military's lashing out at critics.
Abubakar Ibrahim, features editor at the Daily Trust, was on the third floor of the newsroom in Abuja on Sunday when soldiers wearing bulletproof vests and carrying guns rushed inside and ordered everyone to shut down their computers and place them on a table.
"They collected the computers and our laptops then ordered everyone to the reception under escort," he said. "Soldiers were pointing guns at journalists."
Mr. Ibrahim said soldiers also raided a printing press building, effectively shutting it down.
"We've seen the military's attitude to the population and how they can behave. That was playing in my mind," he said. "Amongst us there was bafflement that something like this could happen in this age, supposedly in democratic society."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

TSA agents call in sick as closure drags on

Texto completo: Sick days among Transportation Security Administration employees have increased since a partial government shutdown beginning Dec. 22 left TSA personnel working without pay, the agency announced Friday.
An increase in call-outs — workers who say they are too sick to work their shifts — started over the holidays and has grown, but the phenomenon is causing a "minimal impact" on the security screening process at airports, the agency says in a tweet.
"Security effectiveness will not be compromised and performance standards will not change ... To date, however, screening wait times remain well within TSA standards," the statement said.
The information was released as a response to a CNN report saying mass TSA worker call-outs had affected four major airports. The New York Times also reported on the call-outs.
Of the 2.2 million passengers screened by the agency Thursday, 99.8 percent waited less than 30 minutes, according to the TSA statement.
As the shutdown enters its third week, tens of thousands of TSA agents are among federal employees who are working without pay.
President Donald Trump and lawmakers emerged Friday afternoon from their latest round of talks at the White House only to indicate that an agreement to end the partial shutdown could be a long way off. The shutdown occurred over Trump's demand for $5.6 billion to help pay for a border wall.

Texto completo: Tomorrow Wisconsin's governor and members of the state Senate and Assembly will take their oaths as they either begin their first terms in public office or resume the ones they've already held.
It's a biennial ceremony accompanied by a lot of pomp and circumstance both in the state Capitol and in Washington, D.C., where Congress convened last Thursday. A fellow journalist had a good question about it all. How many of those pledging allegiance to the United States Constitution or the Wisconsin Constitution really believe in or understand those oaths? Indeed, the oaths seem to have become mere words inserted into a ceremonial inauguration, their meaning and role in democratic America often forgotten by politicians who apparently have no intention of putting the public's interest first.
The oaths, for instance, aren't swearing allegiance to a political party, but, clearly, are promises to uphold the constitutions of the U.S. and Wisconsin, which spell out the protections to which every citizen is entitled. They say nothing about politicians' desires to consolidate power, as Wisconsin legislative Republicans did in their lame-duck power play to essentially overturn an election.
Nor did many of those same state politicians consider the oaths they took to defend the federal and state constitutions when they gerrymandered congressional and legislative districts to gain unfair advantage at election time. The constitutions they pledged to uphold call for keeping the interest of the public supreme, not the parochial interests of politicians in hock to their campaign sugar daddies.
Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Robin Vos ignores his oath every time he slaps a gag order on state workers and others to prevent the public from discovering how and why private lawyers were paid hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars to help him and his Republican Party consolidate power.
The documents handed down by our forefathers don't call for special tax benefits for the rich or special privileges for those in power, as Congress' $1.5 trillion tax cut delivered in late 2017.
The oaths to defend the constitutions don't specify that other secret "oaths" are somehow more important, like the pledges many make to a charlatan lobbyist named Grover Norquist to never vote for a tax increase, no matter what. That's what Vos, Scott Walker and dozens of other Republicans have done.
So if it might be in the public's interest to raise the gas tax to fix roads now considered among the worst in the nation, that public interest caves to the Norquist oath. Scott Walker has been the prime example.
The New York Times' conservative columnist David Brooks last week wrote about the loyalty of many members of Congress, especially in light of what he's sure will be the indictment this year of Donald Trump.
"At that point congressional leaders will face the defining choice of their careers: Where does their ultimate loyalty lie, to the Constitution or to their party?" he asked.
Indeed, at what point does ignoring their pledges to uphold the federal and state constitutions undermine our claim to be a government of laws? CREDIT: By Dave Zweifel ; Zweifel writes for The Capital Times: dzweifel@madison.com, 608-252-6410 and @DaveZweifel.

PG&amp;E's stock tumbles amid bankruptcy speculation

Texto completo: California-based utility PG&E's shares plunged 20 percent Friday after media reports claimed the company may file for bankruptcy amid mounting lawsuits over the devastating wildfires that rocked the state and killed dozens.
Reuters, citing unnamed sources, reported Friday that Pacific Gas & Electric is considering the bankruptcy move "as a contingency" but that the filing is not certain. By late in the day, PG&E was "shying away" from the possibility, Reuters quoted an anonymous official as saying.
NPR reported that the parent company of PG&E is planning to sell its natural gas division this spring as part of a plan to cover liability costs and avoid bankruptcy. The proceeds of the sale would be used to set up a fund to pay billions of dollars in potential claims from wildfires, NPR reported, citing unnamed sources.
The news of PG&E's financial maneuvers appears to be taking a toll on its stock price, which fell at least 20 percent in after-hours trading.
PG&E's (NYSE: PCG) shares changed hands at $19.71 per share in late after-hours trading Friday, down $4.69 or almost 20 percent, the San Francisco Business Times reported. The company, led by President and CEO Geisha Williams, faces billions of dollars in liabilities for wildfires in 2017 and 2018.
PG&E has already been named in multiple lawsuits that allege it bears responsibility for wildfire disasters in 2017 and 2018, largely due to equipment malfunctions that created volatile conditions that ignited fires. Cal Fire, the agency investigating the blaze, has not made a determination about its cause.
The North California "Camp Fire" alone killed 85 and destroyed close to 14,000 homes. It took nearly 17 days to bring the fire under control and the town of Paradise, home to 27,000 residents, was destroyed.
In just two weeks, the Camp Fire destroyed more structures than the state's other seven previous worst wildfires combined. It also killed nearly three times as many people as the Griffith Park Fire – a record that stood for 85 years.
Dozens of lawsuits were also filed against PG&E in 2017 following deadly blazes.
"PG&E's board and management are working diligently to assess the company's potential liabilities as a result of the wildfires and the options for addressing those liabilities. We recognize the need to balance the interests of many stakeholders while maintaining safe, reliable and affordable services for our customers, which is always our top priority," the company said in a statement reported by Reuters.
The company also filed for bankruptcy in 2001 during the California energy crisis.

Bears will find out about Trubisky as a playoff QB

Texto completo: PHILADELPHIA — In many ways, what the Bears are about to find out about quarterback Mitchell Trubisky in the playoffs is what the Eagles are longing to find out about their franchise quarterback, Carson Wentz.
The Eagles traded up to draft Wentz second overall in the 2016 draft, one year before the Bears traded up to draft Trubisky.
Trubisky will make his playoff debut Sunday. Wentz is injured heading into the postseason for the second straight season. He has never thrown a pass in a playoff game.
All the talk is about Eagles quarterback Nick Foles' seemingly superhuman feats as a backup leading another playoff run, as well as Trubisky's rise. But really, it should have been about two franchise quarterbacks facing off against each other early in their careers.
It's not like Trubisky has lit up the stat sheet in his second season, although he had a quarterback rating of at least 120.0 in four different games, the most by any Bears quarterback in a single season.
He has 3,223 yards passing and 24 touchdowns, but 12 interceptions, this season. Still, it's an improvement over his rookie campaign in which he threw for 2,193 yards in 12 games with seven TDs and seven interceptions.
Trubisky has also shown he can run the ball, with 421 yards, fifth among QBs this season.
Bears coach Matt Nagy, the former University of Delaware quarterback and Andy Reid protege both with the Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs, is just as anxious to find out about Trubisky in the playoffs as everybody else.
"My approach coming into this year was just for him to know that it's going to take a little time," Nagy said. "We're going to learn together. I'm going to learn how he plays, and he'll learn how I coach."
As the Chicago Sun Times writes, the playoffs are when a quarterback's legacy is established. The Bears have the opportunity to find out about Trubisky. The Eagles are still waiting to find out about Wentz.
Rapid fire Brothers in arms could be literal as Eagles defensive end Chris Long could end up trying to get past his brother, Bears' right guard Kyle, to sack Trubisky. Kyle Long told the NFL Network that "on Sunday, we're not related." Then he was asked what kind of communication he'll have on the field with Chris: "No good communication ... He's on the other team, so I gotta figure out a way to beat him."
There have been plenty of comparisons of Eagles running back Darren Sproles and the Bears' Tarik Cohen, mainly because both are undersized at 5-foot-6 and both are seen as receivers first. Cohen led the Bears in receptions with 71 and was second in receiving yards with 725. Malcolm Jenkins, who respects and admires Cohen, said no one compares to Sproles.
But Cohen, in his second season, has many of the attributes of Sproles, who's 35 years old. The New York Times describes Cohen as "the Bears' handoff-taking, punt-returning, ball-catching, pass-throwing, mismatch-creating, gasp-inducing, highlight-monopolizing cyborg." One can say the same about Sproles.
Remember tight end Trey Burton, the famous thrower of the 1-yard TD pass to Foles in the Super Bowl, forever known in Eagles' lore as the "Philly Special?" Now, he's an integral part of the Bears' offense. Burton reflects fondly on his time with the Eagles, as NBC Sports Chicago details.
Around the NFC East Cowboys
When the Cowboys made the trade for Amari Cooper in late October, they were thinking more about the future than getting into the playoffs this season. After all, they were 3-5 at the time, and as Cowboys vice president Stephen Jones put it, according to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram: "We were thinking: We're already behind the 8-ball, long shot to get back in it. This is really about long term. But we got back in it. And he helped us get in it."
Speaking of Cooper, he hasn't done much since torching the Eagles for 10 catches for 217 yards and three TDs on Dec. 9. In the three games since, Cooper has 13 catches for 83 yards. So ESPN.com wonders which Cooper will show up in the playoff game against the Seahawks.
The Cowboys and Seahawks have an interesting history. The Seattle Times breaks down the 5 best games between the two teams. That includes the 2006 playoff game that featured Cowboys' rookie QB Tony Romo, whose claim to fame that game was the botched hold for the potential game-winning field goal.
Giants
The offseason intrigue for the Giants began immediately when general manager Dave Gettleman didn't commit to Eli Manning's return for the 2019 season, and Manning himself didn't commit to it either in his radio show on New York's WFAN. "I don't know if it's leaning one way or the other right now," Manning said on the radio show. "I think this is kind of the time to reflect and figure out what's the best thing going forward."
Washington
How do you fix the Redskins? The Washington Post counts the ways with the team's offseason needs. That could include quarterback with Alex Smith's uncertain status following a devastating broken leg. And it could possibly include releasing cornerback Josh Norman.

Pioneers Inch Ahead Into the Twilight

Texto completo: Nearly four years ago, I began following six people over age 85 to see what their lives were like: what kept them going, what they hoped for or feared. This past year, I asked Jonas Mekas, now 96, about death and the afterlife.
The question had particular resonance. In summer Mr. Mekas had been hospitalized for a blood disorder that was still mysterious to his doctors. It was the first sign in four years that he was mortal. He canceled a trip to Berlin because he was tired and short of breath, and was now walking with a cane, his complexion grayish. Since his 20s he had used his movie camera to protect him from the outside world. Now his doctors were using cameras to explore the worlds within.
He did not think much about death, he said. He had grown up next to two cemeteries in rural Lithuania, where the gravediggers drank beer and talked between jobs, and so that was how he thought about death, as something commonplace.
"It's a very normal transition," he said. "What's beyond that line, it's where the mystery begins, where it becomes interesting. There are glimpses in the messages that come from there, some of the old Scriptures. Indications are there, and I believe it all. I believe it much more than anything that's written since the 12th century."
We were onstage at Anthology Film Archives, the nonprofit theater he helped start in 1970, and he turned to address his audience. "All I can tell you," he said, "is that life does not end in this room."
So closes another year for some members of what gerontologists have called the "oldest old," one of the fastest-growing age groups in the country. Their world got a little smaller, its mysteries a little more pressing. Two of the series' six subjects died in 2016 -- Fred Jones, who asked God for 110 years, and John Sorensen, who missed his partner of 60 years, and who said every time we got together that he wanted to die. Both gone within a few months of each other -- death, apparently, makes its own plans.
For the others, 2018 was a challenge. Ping Wong turned 93 in a nursing home in southern New Jersey: dementia. Helen Moses, still not married to Howie Zeimer, turned 94 at the Hebrew Home in the Riverdale section of the Bronx: a fall, some Parkinson's-like symptoms, then internal bleeding. Ruth Willig turned 95 in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn: a fall on a bus, another in the shower, an infection that took two courses of antibiotics to curb.
[Read earlier installments of John Leland's '85 and Up' series.]
But this is an accounting of maladies, not of lives. Ms. Wong spoke by video with a goddaughter in China she hadn't seen in 50 years; Ms. Moses and Mr. Zeimer very nearly had a religious commitment ceremony in October, before health concerns intervened; Ms. Willig traveled to the wedding of her granddaughter and celebrated her great-granddaughter's first birthday.
"She was going come hell or high water," Ms. Willig's daughter Judy said of the wedding. In November, when the family gathered for a small 95th birthday celebration, Ms. Willig said that if she made it to 100, they could hold a big one.
And for Mr. Mekas, it was a year like no other. He paid tribute to a forgotten cinematic trailblazer, raised millions of dollars to expand Anthology Film Archives, played a major role in a New York exhibit about the Velvet Underground and was accused, in The New York Review of Books, of downplaying his interactions with anti-Semitic elements in Lithuania during the Holocaust. After the last, he gave a detailed, six-hour interview to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, describing a time period about which he has rarely spoken in public.
What a year. What a four-year stretch. If they'd been freshmen when the series started, they would be new graduates now, with diplomas and plans. Instead, their four years have been extended improvisations, their goals and achievements rarely reflected in the broader culture.
Memories kept bubbling up, an abundance compared to the thinning years ahead. For them, memory remains something in the head, not in the device, and when they depart, the process of remembering will change without them. So much is said about memory loss in old age. But what about memory muscle, which younger generations have not needed?
They were born when American life expectancy hovered around 60 years, and they surpassed current expectations around the time they rounded 80. But life, too, has plans: at age 80, an American man can expect eight more years, a woman almost ten. That's longer than adolescence.
And still, it has been left to them to invent life at their age, without the guideposts or role models of their earlier years. As the British novelist Penelope Lively wrote when she was 80: "Our experience is one unknown to most of humanity, over time. We are the pioneers."
Having gotten old in an aging culture that still worships youth, they have done the unthinkable: gotten older.
"Did you ever meet anyone like me?" Ms. Moses asked one day at the Hebrew Home. "I'm special. A lot of people know me here. I don't know them. They go, Hi, Helen."
Ms. Moses started the year visibly slower than she'd been at the start of the Times series, no longer boasting about being in trouble with this or that nurse. But she was also quick to express gratitude toward her daughter and Mr. Zeimer, who were often at odds.
"Howie," she said, addressing Mr. Zeimer, "aren't I kind to you? You better say yes."
He did, adding that over the last year, "She's grown older and more wiser and more perfect for me."
"He's very kind," Ms. Moses said. "We never had a fight. We never left each other where he just said good night. Always with a kiss.
"I kiss him good-night," she said. "Want to see?"
"No," said her daughter, Zoe Gussoff, before reversing herself: "Whatever makes them happy."
It was lunch hour, but Ms. Moses pushed her sandwich away after a few bites. This year she lost much of her appetite and has lost some weight. At 94, she still does not need glasses, but wears hearing aids, which the nursing home staff stores at night. When she gets ambulating with her walker, it is hard to keep up with her.
"You're going to be here 10 years in February," Ms. Gussoff told her.
"That's a long time," Ms. Moses said. Most of the friends she made when she first got to the home had died. "It's a nice place," she said. "It's clean. Most people are nice. Some are not. That's it."
In spring, she fell and required four stitches by her eye. The fall meant increased supervision from nursing home staff, and for the first time, a wheelchair -- a severe drop in autonomy for Ms. Moses. During treatment, doctors also noted Parkinson's-like symptoms, and they were uncertain whether she would ever walk again.
Ms. Gussoff took her to an outside neurologist, who enabled her to walk using a walker. But the turn in Ms. Moses's health had a bigger consequence: Ms. Gussoff, who had vehemently opposed any marriage between her mother and Mr. Zeimer, was now willing to bless a commitment ceremony, as long as the couple didn't live together, and as long as Ms. Gussoff would remain in charge of her mother's health care.
"My daughter convinced me," Ms. Gussoff said. "She said, 'What would be the harm? Grandma's 94, what's the difference? Make her happy."'
Progress!
The couple, who are fans of the show "Say Yes to the Dress," made plans. On the internet, Ms. Gussoff's daughter found something called a "Short Scoop Bridesmaid Floral Lace Dress Cocktail Formal Swing Dress." They lined up a rabbi and picked a couple of dates in October for the ceremony.
"Commitment," Ms. Gussoff reiterated. "We don't say the word 'marriage."'
Then life intervened.
As the dates approached, Ms. Moses started complaining about stomach pains. When she finally got to a hospital emergency room, doctors found bleeding from her lower intestine. She spent two and a half weeks in intensive care or recovery.
"I was lonesome," Mr. Zeimer said. "I wondered whether it was possible to come and see her but they told me no."
When Ms. Moses returned to the nursing home, life intervened again. This time, the rabbi got sick.
She and Mr. Zeimer have not given up hopes to get hitched, as Mr. Zeimer puts it. In the meantime, he moved to a room closer to hers, and still watches television with her at night, though he leaves earlier than previously because they get tired.
As in past years, Ms. Moses talked often about her own mother and how much she missed her. Her mother had taught her so many things, but not how to be 94: how to manage a daughter who liked to take charge and a boyfriend who made her feel needed again, all set against the daily wear of aging. In this act she was on her own.
Summing up, Ms. Moses said, "If it wasn't for the hospital I had a good year."
Two hours south, in Voorhees, N.J., Ms. Wong asked after my mother, who turned 90 this year, and broke her hip. Did she have activities where she lived? Ms. Wong asked.
"Here you have three meals, a bedroom and then a lot of activities," she said, describing her days in the nursing home, where she moved in 2016 to be near her daughter. "You can pass time, enjoy yourself. Usually this kind of activity is good for the elderly, but your mom is too far from this place, otherwise it's better to come here to enjoy herself."
Four years ago, at the start of the series, Ms. Wong had lived in a subsidized apartment near Gramercy Park in Manhattan, where she spent her days playing mah-jongg with three women from the building. The onset of dementia and consequent move to the nursing home had been very difficult for her, and this year her spirits were up and down. Though she has made new friends, she also had recurring bouts of anxiety, including one that landed her in the hospital.
"She kept telling the people they put hot water on her and burned her skin," Ms. Wong's daughter, Elaine Gin, said. "Delusions. Finally they sent her to the hospital. I was there at 4 or 5 o'clock in the morning. I entered the emergency-room door and I can hear her talking. She's nice, she says, 'Thank you very much,' 'You're so nice.' They do all the tests. She's fine, but she's talking and talking and talking. At 11:40 my friend came so I could go to work, and she's still talking. They moved her to a room, and she couldn't stay by herself. I got off early, at 4 o'clock, and she's still talking. At 6:30 she finally calmed down. She wanted to stand up, she wanted to walk around."
In late November she was back in the hospital, this time for dehydration and kidney malfunction. When I asked what was wrong, she said: "I think I fell down, because I am very weak. Now I can't take very big steps."
But even with her setbacks this year, Ms. Wong remained proudly resourceful, insisting that her rewards at the home outweighed the hardships.
"I'm the oldest, so I know everybody when they are admitted," she said. "I have a lot to talk about what we are facing."
And she found a new way to begin our conversations: "I remember you," she'd say, and the act of remembering -- and the joy of declaring it -- seemed to fill the moment with meaning, a small gift near the end of a long life.
In Sheepshead Bay, Ruth Willig gave thanks for larger gifts this year: as she stayed mostly the same, her family changed around her.
"I dare not talk about not surviving," she said one afternoon in her apartment, where balloons in the shape of a 9 and 5 held their last whiffs of helium. "My children, my son especially, say, 'Oh, Ma, you're going to keep going forever.' The thought of my passing is very upsetting to him."
Ms. Willig could not help noting the passage of time, especially the absence of her three siblings. Once the youngest, she was now the last of her generation. "It's weird to be the only one left, it really is," she said. "I can't really call anyone: do you remember this? It was not easy at first. I'm getting used to it."
Patterns held: she avoided most activities in her assisted living building, and she went to the New Jersey Shore with her children for a summer vacation. She canceled her weekday newspaper subscription because the papers were adding up -- "And how much can you read, really?" she said -- but then renewed it because she missed it.
Some things got harder. Photographs of her great-granddaughter abounded, but only in people's cellphones, "so what does it do for me?" she said. The house at the shore was advertised as accessible for people with disabilities, but there was no grab bar in the shower, and the high-end mattress in her bedroom was too high for her to climb onto.
"They haven't walked a mile in the shoes of someone who needs it," Judy Willig said.
Then Ms. Willig banged her shin on the steps of her building's shuttle bus -- a small injury for a younger person, but the impact shredded the thin skin on her leg, and because she was on baby aspirin to prevent a stroke, there was a lot of bleeding.
The wound required her to cover the leg in waterproof wrap when she showered, which led to another fall.
"When the cut got infected, we both worried," Judy Willig said. "We didn't talk about being worried, but we were."
Still, there was a wedding and a birthday. And the unlikely fact of another year, with its ups and downs. Ninety-five, who would have thought?
"I find it amazing, how we're living so long," she said. "We keep going on."
Jonas Mekas glided into 2018 on the wings of other artists, looking backward at departed associates. Through a German publisher, he resuscitated his defunct magazine Film Culture for a book-length issue devoted to Barbara Rubin, an extraordinary character who blew into New York and Mr. Mekas's life in 1963 as a fearless teenager, and wound up connecting Bob Dylan to Allen Ginsberg and Andy Warhol to the Velvet Underground. After making a taboo-busting underground film called "Christmas on Earth," she left the scene for France and ultra-Orthodox Judaism, and died at age 35 of an infection after giving birth to her fifth child. Like Mr. Mekas, she'd been one of the vital background players who made better-known artists like Mr. Warhol or Lou Reed possible.
In midyear Mr. Mekas's backward glances took an unwelcome turn. In a long article in The New York Review of Books, Michael Casper examined Mr. Mekas's work at two Lithuanian publications during the Nazi occupation, where his poems or reviews sometimes ran beside virulently anti-Semitic calls to violence. The article noted that Mr. Mekas's writing was not anti-Semitic, but argued that his proximity to pro-Nazi hate speech clashed with the image he has created for himself. Mr. Casper wrote that Mr. Mekas "has repeatedly manipulated his story, taking advantage of people's ignorance of wartime Lithuania, to make himself appear, when useful, as victim, hero, or oblivious bystander."
Mr. Mekas denounced the article as "dirty" and inaccurate, arguing that the toxic material in those newspapers ran only briefly and that the papers were principally devoted to local news and culture, a tacit form of resistance to occupation. After 75 years, he said, that period remained unreal to him, because it was "such an unnatural intrusion, that I cannot identify myself. It's like it does not belong, that period."
At an art opening shortly after the article appeared, Mr. Mekas looked weak and nearly broken -- a 95-year-old crushed by a ghost from his past. But another culprit surfaced: a hemoglobin deficiency and polyps in his digestive tract. By fall, between monthly blood transfusions, he was gushing about new music by Eminem and Cat Power. As the shock of the article receded, he focused on the miracle of his care.
"Which translates into strengthening my trust in the essential goodness of humanity," he wrote in an email health update to friends. "No, humanity is not yet lost. It's only confused. Yes, the bad news dominate all the media. But there are unseen, invisible millions of men and women who daily perform invisible but essential human acts that, I firmly believe, is moving the human evolution along the lines envisioned by the Poet of the Eternity."
Would Mr. Mekas have had this perspective at a younger age? Perhaps not. But at 96, it defines him.
He ended the year tired from another trip to the hospital, his blood condition seemingly stabilized but his appetite scarce from acid reflux. "There are aspects that are improving," he said on New Year's Day. "Maybe nothing is getting worse, but remains the same."
So begins a new year for four pioneers on an alien frontier, and for the exceedingly grateful reporter who has followed them through 17 articles, one video, a book and countless glimpses of past and future. Their stories are a year closer to the end, as are all of ours. But all discovered something in 2018, and all said they were glad to have experienced it.
Onward to 2019, whatever it may hold.

Texto completo: In a recent column (Dec. 27), Cal Thomas suggested we may well be living on the threshold of the end times, considering the many media reports of “wars and rumors of wars.” But history teems with records of such. In fact, in 2003 The New York Times published an article on war which stated: “Of the past 3,400 years, humans have been at peace for 268 of them …”
Thomas’s quote regarding war comes from Chapter 24 of Matthew’s Gospel, which contains prophecies of the end times and the Second Coming, a matter the columnist also wrote about. In verse 34, Christ proclaims that the signs of those times and his return would occur sometime during the lifetimes of his contemporaries — 20 centuries dead now and he himself the supreme no-show.
The columnist, a staunch Bible-only Christian, wrote that no one has the right to change the true meaning of Christmas to suit themselves, a meaning he defined as encompassing the incarnation, Christ’s substitutionary death, forgiveness of believers’ sins and the promise of heaven.
Then informed Christians of differing beliefs must be perversely suiting themselves in denying, say, the incarnation (Unitarians and Jehovah’s Witnesses), or biblical inerrancy/infallibility (Episcopalians), or in affirming the doctrine of the annihilation of the unrepentant (Seventh-day Adventists and the Witnesses), or the equality of Scripture and tradition (the Orthodox and Catholics),etc.
Thomas didn’t state what he believes ultimately becomes of such Christians. I wonder if, in his view, they are nonetheless saved.

California PG&amp;E's stock tumbles 20 percent amid reports of bankruptcy musings

Texto completo: California-based utility PG&E's shares plunged 20 percent Friday after media reports claimed the company may file for bankruptcy amid mounting lawsuits over the devastating wildfires that rocked the state and killed dozens.
Reuters, citing unnamed sources, reported Friday that Pacific Gas & Electric is considering the bankruptcy move "as a contingency" but that the filing is not certain. By late in the day, PG&E was "shying away" from the possibility, Reuters quoted an anonymous official as saying.
NPR reported that the parent company of PG&E is planning to sell its natural gas division this spring as part of a plan to cover liability costs and avoid bankruptcy. The proceeds of the sale would be used to set up a fund to pay billions of dollars in potential claims from wildfires, NPR reported, citing unnamed sources.
The news of PG&E's financial maneuvers appears to be taking a toll on its stock price, which fell at least 20 percent in after-hours trading.
PG&E’s (NYSE: PCG) shares changed hands at $19. 71 per share in late after-hours trading Friday, down $4. 69 or almost 20 percent, the San Francisco Business Times reported. The company, led by President and CEO Geisha Williams, faces billions of dollars in liabilities for wildfires in 2017 and 2018.
PG&E has already been named in multiple lawsuits that allege it bears responsibility for wildfire disasters in 2017 and 2018, largely due to equipment malfunctions that created volatile conditions that ignited fires. Cal Fire, the agency investigating the blaze, has not made a determination about its cause.
The North California "Camp Fire" alone killed 85 and destroyed close to 14,000 homes. It took nearly 17 days to bring the fire under control and the town of Paradise, home to 27,000 residents, was destroyed.
In just two weeks, the Camp Fire destroyed more structures than the state's other seven previous worst wildfires combined. It also killed nearly three times as many people as the Griffith Park Fire – a record that stood for 85 years.
Dozens of lawsuits were also filed against PG&E in 2017 following deadly blazes.
“PG&E’s board and management are working diligently to assess the company’s potential liabilities as a result of the wildfires and the options for addressing those liabilities. We recognize the need to balance the interests of many stakeholders while maintaining safe, reliable and affordable services for our customers, which is always our top priority,” the company said in a statement reported by Reuters.
The company also filed for bankruptcy in 2001 during the California energy crisis.

SEAL pleads not guilty in ISIS slaying

Texto completo: A decorated Navy SEAL accused of premeditated murder against a teenage ISIS prisoner and nearly a dozen other charges pleaded not guilty, his attorney said.
Special Operations Chief Edward Gallagher entered he plea at his arraignment Friday at Naval Base San Diego.
Gallagher allegedly stabbed the teen in the neck and body with a knife after he'd been handed over to the SEALs to be treated for wounds he sustained during an air strike in May 2017. Investigators say he then "wrongfully" posed with the body and completed his reenlistment ceremony next to it.
The 19-year-veteran is said to have "walked up (to the teenager's body) without saying anything at all" and began stabbing him, according to Naval Criminal Investigative Service Special Agent Joe Warpinski. Warpinski said a medic had told him moments before that he believed the boy, around 15 years old, had just become stabilized.
He is also charged with shooting two "noncombatant" people, among other offenses.
The high-profile case has garnered attention, in part, because the prosecution's case includes testimony from fellow Navy SEALs, a rarity considering how tight-knit the group is.
Prosecutors are arguing that Gallagher, who was awarded a Bronze Star twice, went off the rails during his eighth deployment in 2017.
Gallagher denies all charges. His attorney, Phil Stackhouse, alleges that those testifying against his client are only doing so because they wanted to get rid of the platoon leader.
"We will be relentless in the pursuit (of) justice for Eddie Gallagher," Stackhouse wrote on Facebook.
Gallagher's wife, Andrea, told The New York Times that "this is not who Eddie is."
"He is a lifesaver. He is that guy who runs into the burning building when other people are running out," she told the newspaper.
If convicted, Gallagher will face life in prison.

Pelosi says the Constitution considers her an equal to Trump

Texto completo: Nancy Pelosi says the Constitution sees her as equal to President Trump.

After being asked if she considers herself Trump's equal, Pelosi told the New York Times in an interview published Thursday that, “The Constitution does.”

It wasn't clear if Pelosi was talking about the equality of men and women, or their respective political positions in the federal government. Pelosi, D-Calif., was elected speaker for the second time on Thursday when the 116th Congress convened and Democrats took back control of the House.

In taking back the gavel, Pelosi is now the second in line to the presidency, after Vice President Mike Pence, if Trump were unable to perform his duties as commander in chief.

Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are the three others that fall behind Pelosi in line to the presidency.

In her interview with the Times, Pelosi also said she was hoping women would have more of a voice in the new Congress now that a woman was back in the speakership seat.

She recounted a time when there was a dinner at the White House last year and men continuously talked over her. “Doesn’t anybody listen to a woman in the room?” Pelosi asked at the time.

“Hopefully that will become a thing of the past now that we have so many women in Congress — and with the gavel,” Pelosi said. “The gavel makes a big difference."

Democrats now hold a 235-199 majority in the House, and Republicans widened their majority in the Senate with 53-47. The 116th Congress is the first divided Congress since 2015 when former President Barack Obama was still in office.

U.S. to Investigate Discrimination Against Native American Students on Montana Reservation

Resumen: A year and a half after receiving a detailed complaint from tribal leaders, the U.S. Department of Education plans to investigate their allegations that the Wolf Point School District in Montana discriminates against Native American students. According to the letter, the investigation will focus on whether Wolf Point schools discipline Native students more harshly than white students, shunt them into remedial programs without appropriate cause, and deny them special education evaluations and services. The department’s decision to look into the tribal leaders’ broader allegations bucks the Education Department’s policy under Secretary Betsy DeVos of pulling back from investigating complaints of systemic discrimination by schools and colleges, and concentrating on mistreatment of individuals.

Texto completo: A year and a half after receiving a detailed complaint from tribal leaders, the U.S. Department of Education plans to investigate their allegations that the Wolf Point School District in Montana discriminates against Native American students.
In a Dec. 28 letter, sent hours after The New York Times and ProPublica published an investigation into racial inequities in the school district, the department’s Office for Civil Rights notified the lawyer representing the tribal executive board of the Fort Peck Indian Reservation that it would look into the complaint. The board includes members of the Assiniboine and Sioux tribes.
According to the letter, the investigation will focus on whether Wolf Point schools discipline Native students more harshly than white students, shunt them into remedial programs without appropriate cause, and deny them special education evaluations and services. Native American and mixed-race students make up more than three-quarters of Wolf Point’s enrollment.
The department said it will also examine whether the district failed to respond to a parent’s allegations that a Native student was racially harassed. The student wasn’t identified in the tribal complaint or in the letter.
“Tribal children have suffered unfairly for years in the Wolf Point School District,” said Melina Healey, the lawyer representing the tribal executive board. She called for a “swift and thorough investigation that leads to much-needed reforms.”
The Office for Civil Rights is already looking into a complaint by Louella Contreras that the Wolf Point district failed to provide her granddaughter, Ruth Fourstar, with special education services. The department’s decision to look into the tribal leaders’ broader allegations bucks the Education Department’s policy under Secretary Betsy DeVos of pulling back from investigating complaints of systemic discrimination by schools and colleges, and concentrating on mistreatment of individuals. ProPublica reported in June that, under DeVos, the department had scuttled more than 1,200 civil rights investigations that began under the Obama administration and lasted at least six months.
Nationwide, more than 90 percent of Native students attend integrated public schools near or on reservations, which have historically restricted tribal influence over curriculum, funding and staffing. Native American students have some of the worst academic outcomes in public schools: They score lower than nearly all other demographic groups on national tests and less than three-fourths of Native students graduate from high school.
In the early 20th century, white homesteaders prevailed on the federal government to open up unused lands on the Fort Peck Indian Reservation to non-Native settlement. In June 2017, the tribal executive board filed a 46-page complaint that described dozens of instances where Wolf Point schools provided limited academic opportunities and social support to Native students.
ProPublica and the Times found that Native students in Wolf Point are twice as likely to receive at least one suspension compared with their white peers, and white students are more than 10 times as likely to take at least one Advanced Placement course as Native students, according to an analysis of federal education data. In interviews, students, staff and parents said Wolf Point’s schools push Native children into a poorly funded, understaffed program for remedial students and truants. Native students said they were dropped from sports teams after giving birth, while a white pregnant student was not.
The Times-ProPublica investigation also found that some Native students have turned to self-harm and suicide. Three months before the tribal executive board’s complaint, a Wolf Point High School junior killed himself following a public rebuke from the principal for poor attendance, two students said. He was the second student at the high school in seven years to take his own life after being chided by district administrators.

District of Despair: On a Montana Reservation, Schools Favor Whites Over Native Americans
Tribes say that discrimination by the Wolf Point School District contributes to some of their youth dropping out, harming themselves or even committing suicide. But the Trump administration hasn’t acted on their complaint.
On a Reservation, a Second Chance for Prisoners and Their Warden
As a school board member in Wolf Point, Montana, Ron Jackson couldn’t help struggling Native students as much as he hoped. Now some are inmates under his supervision.
Jeana Lervick, an attorney representing the school district, said the district is closed for the holidays and is unable to comment on the federal investigation. “Wolf Point Schools works constantly to address the challenges facing our students and in particular, our Indigenous students,” Lervick said in an earlier statement. “Our district is aware of historical issues in our nation and as educators do everything in our power to address them.”
The district’s superintendent and the high school principal did not respond to emailed questions.
Should civil rights investigators identify violations of federal law, the school district could lose federal funding. Typically, before investigators recommend sanctions, school districts voluntarily enter into an agreement with the department to remedy any wrongdoing and bring the district back into compliance with federal law. Federal civil rights investigations can take up to several years to resolve.
“Instead of providing a safe learning environment, the Wolf Point School District adds to the long history of educational abuses of our tribal communities,” said Roxanne Gourneau, a former member of the Fort Peck tribal executive board, who has worked to reform Wolf Point schools since her son took his life after being disciplined at the high school. “The school district has done more to fuel Native students’ trauma than to support their education. Change is long overdue.”

Texto completo: California-based utility PG&E's shares plunged 20 percent Friday after media reports claimed the company may file for bankruptcy amid mounting lawsuits over the devastating wildfires that rocked the state and killed dozens.
Reuters, citing unnamed sources, reported Friday that Pacific Gas & Electric is considering the bankruptcy move "as a contingency" but that the filing is not certain. By late in the day, PG&E was "shying away" from the possibility, Reuters quoted an anonymous official as saying.
NPR reported that the parent company of PG&E is planning to sell its natural gas division this spring as part of a plan to cover liability costs and avoid bankruptcy. The proceeds of the sale would be used to set up a fund to pay billions of dollars in potential claims from wildfires, NPR reported, citing unnamed sources.
The news of PG&E's financial maneuvers appears to be taking a toll on its stock price, which fell at least 20 percent in after-hours trading.
PG&E’s (NYSE: PCG) shares changed hands at $19. 71 per share in late after-hours trading Friday, down $4. 69 or almost 20 percent, the San Francisco Business Times reported. The company, led by President and CEO Geisha Williams, faces billions of dollars in liabilities for wildfires in 2017 and 2018.
PG&E has already been named in multiple lawsuits that allege it bears responsibility for wildfire disasters in 2017 and 2018, largely due to equipment malfunctions that created volatile conditions that ignited fires. Cal Fire, the agency investigating the blaze, has not made a determination about its cause.
The North California "Camp Fire" alone killed 85 and destroyed close to 14,000 homes. It took nearly 17 days to bring the fire under control and the town of Paradise, home to 27,000 residents, was destroyed.
In just two weeks, the Camp Fire destroyed more structures than the state's other seven previous worst wildfires combined. It also killed nearly three times as many people as the Griffith Park Fire – a record that stood for 85 years.
Dozens of lawsuits were also filed against PG&E in 2017 following deadly blazes.
“PG&E’s board and management are working diligently to assess the company’s potential liabilities as a result of the wildfires and the options for addressing those liabilities. We recognize the need to balance the interests of many stakeholders while maintaining safe, reliable and affordable services for our customers, which is always our top priority,” the company said in a statement reported by Reuters.
The company also filed for bankruptcy in 2001 during the California energy crisis.

Texto completo: Durgin-Park, a centuries-old Boston landmark that has long attracted tourists with its clam chowder, pot roast, and other quintessential New England Yankee fare, is closing its doors.
The Faneuil Hall restaurant will close on Jan. 12, according to restaurant manager Kenneth Thimothee, who cited financial reasons including an increased minimum wage.
“It's very unfortunate, but the costs are too high," he said.
Michael Weinstein, the chief executive of Ark Restaurants, which owns the 340 North Market St. eatery, also suggested that Faneuil Hall has lost traffic to other areas in Boston and customer counts are down.
“I'm not happy about it, and we're trying to look for a solution," such as finding parties who might purchase the space, said Weinstein.
Joe O'Malley, general manager of Faneuil Hall Marketplace, said in a statement Thursday, “Durgin-Park is still under a lease agreement with Faneuil Hall Marketplace. No formal closing notification has been submitted." Attempts to glean further comment were unsuccessful Thursday night.
The establishment lays a claim to being one of the oldest restaurants in the city. It's named after John Durgin and Eldridge Park, who along with John Chandler opened it in 1827. According to the Globe archives, before it was known as Durgin-Park, a restaurant in Faneuil Hall had catered to sailors on the waterfront and meat cutters of Quincy Market as far back as 1742.
It has played host to such presidents as Theodore Roosevelt, Calvin Coolidge, and Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and it garnered a reputation for hearty cuts of roast beef, Boston baked beans, and its signature Indian pudding served on long tables covered with red checked tablecloths.
Durgin-Park occupies several floors, including a basement bar called the HideOut, the street-level Gaslight Pub, a main dining room on the second floor, and another function room above that.
The restaurant is also legendary for the all-in-good-fun gruff demeanor of its waitresses.
“The waitresses, who seem to resent your presence, are rude and famous for it," read one dispatch from The New York Times in 1985.
“Durgin-Park, which dates to the 1820s, is famous for classic Boston cuisine, cramped family-style seating, and surly waitresses," read one 2009 Globe report.
Durgin-Park would be the latest Boston culinary institution to shutter. Jacob Wirth Co., the historic beer hall founded by a German immigrant in 1868, was put up for sale last year. The Back Bay restaurant L'Espalier, known for its sophisticated fare and impeccable service, closed after 40 years on Dec. 31.
Thursday found Durgin-Park's staff, equipped with non-rhotic accents you could cut with a meat cleaver, in a friendly, albeit melancholy, mood.
“It shouldn't go under," said Gina Schertzer, the head waitress who has worked at the restaurant since 1976, in a phone interview. “I thought this place was going to be alive longer than I'd be alive."
Schertzer, a 76-year-old Belmont resident, said the establishment employs more than 100 people. She said she'll miss the patrons and the job “tremendously."
“It becomes part of your blood after a while," she said.
Schertzer also offered an explanation of the origin of the salty reputation of the waitstaff. She said for decades, Durgin-Park served working-class patrons who toiled at third-shift jobs. They would give the staff attitude. The attitude was eventually returned in kind and became an ingrained part of the place's charm, she said.
“It was all done in fun," she said. “It was never done to offend anyone."
Thursday evening found the ground-floor bar sparsely populated. A few patrons sipped from pint or martini glasses.
Bartender Richelle Mazzone said she has not seen many changes during her 30 years working there.
“They try to keep it the same, that's why people come back all the time," she said.
The crowd is a mix, she said, lots of tourists, some Bruins and Celtics fans before or after games, and after-work lawyers and bankers.
“It's a fun place, you meet someone new every day," said Mazzone, who lives in Peabody.
She said she's seen more competition in recent years in the restaurant and bar scene.
“The younger kids like newer places, like the Seaport," she said.
She also suggested that maintenance costs were a problem.
“There's plumbers here every day, there's heating guys here every day," she said. “That's where it goes instead of going in your pocket as profit."
John Bell, who has worked nine years waiting tables and bartending at Durgin-Park, said he enjoyed seeing customers who have come to the restaurant for decades.
“You feel connected to some of the people, it's just the experience of the place," said Bell, a Quincy native.
Bell said the restaurant had not been keeping up with industry trends. Ciders, for instance, have become popular, but the bar did not carry a popular cider brand until the past year, he said. Sour beers have been trendy for more than a year, but the bar just got on board last month, he added.
“They weren't developing with the times, they were just staying with what they had," he said.
He added that he would love to see someone buy the restaurant and make it work.
“Tom Brady!" suggested Mazzone from behind the bar. “Or how about Marky Mark?"
One Bostonian who feels a connection to the restaurant was surprised by the news. Mark White, the son of the late Boston Mayor Kevin White, who during the 1970s reinjected new life into the deteriorating Quincy Market complex with the opening of Faneuil Hall Marketplace, said he was caught flat-footed by word that such a historic establishment was closing.
“We ought to think twice about having a public conversation about closing it down like it's a McDonald's," said White by phone.
In the 1970s, Faneuil Hall represented a groundbreaking experiment for what an urban retail district could be, said White. It is now one of the more tangible parts of his father's legacy. Durgin-Park is part of that history, White said.
The restaurant, he said, is “part of the soul of the city."
At the bar Thursday evening, Dillon McCarthy, a 30-year-old Natick resident who works in advertising, tucked into a plate of steak and potatoes, washing it down with Johnnie Walker, soda water, and a lime.
He had never been to the restaurant before. Despite its location in the heart of a tourist hub, he said it felt authentic.
“I feel like I'm right at home in here," he said.

The Rev. Jackson and the Rev. Sharpton-twin voices of struggle

Texto completo: We should not be surprised that the Revs. Jesse Jackson and A1 Sharpton would deliver New Year's messages with a similar resonance, evoking Scripture, history and the Civil Rights Movement.
As if anticipating Jackson's stirring op-ed in Monday's New York Times that focused on the Emancipation Proclamation and the fact tliat 2019 will mark the 400th anniversary of the forced arrival of Africans in the Americas, Sharpton observed that the international slave trade was an immigration policy. "And the first commodity was a Black body," he told the audience Saturday at the National Action Network.
Moreover, to underscore his point, he discussed the "Door of No Return" on Goree Island off the coast of Africa and how important it was to remember tliat for all the millions who would never step back through tliat door, President Barack Obama did.
"Countless number were taken from Africa as slaves, and a Black man walked back through as president," Sharpton exuded.
At the opening of Jackson's comments was an epigraph from Exodus: 13:13-"Then Moses said to the people, 'Commemorate this day, the day you came out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery, because the Lord brought you out of it with a mighty hand.'"
With this piece of Scripture, Jackson connected the determination of the Hebrew people with the relentless fight for freedom waged by Black Americans.
"Yet in the darkness of chattel slavery," Jackson wrote, "the enslaved were able to sustain enough of their humanity to maintain a light of hope for a better day, for freedom and for equality. African-Americans were able to see the dimly lit outlines of a more just social, economic and political order, even during slavery, apartheid and centuries of discrimination. But Black people did not wait for freedom to fall from the sky. The Colonial era and beyond bristled with slave rebellions and resistance."
For his Scriptural reference, Sharpton cited the courage and leadership of Gideon; from the Book of Judges from the Hebrew bibie. "He felt he was unworthy to lead his people," Sharpton said, but in the end he was successful in bable, overcoming liis adversaries in the same way Rosa Parks "had broken the chains of slave men - tality." He added, "And keep in mind tliat there were other Blacks on tliat bus."
In their own special way, each leader addressed the current political and social climate. Although Jackson did not mention Trump's name, his inference was clear when he noted, "The lies, myths, and insanity of white supremacy contaminated the soil and the soul of America."
He continued, "The Academy said African-American minds were inferior. The medical establishment said our bodies were inferior; the church, our morality. The banks determined tliat we were unworthy for loans or investment. These barriers have yet to be completely broken down. We are free but unequal. Yet still we rise."
On the other hand, Sharpton was more direct in assailing the president. "We have the most reactionary and backward president in our history," he charged.
He was particularly incensed tliat Trump had made a surprise visit to the troops in Iraq and took credit for a 10 percent raise they didn't get.
"If he opens liis mouth," Sharpton said, "he's going to lie."
Both ministers recalled their recent activities and commitments. "I spent Christmas morning-as I have for more than 40 years-visiting and praying with the inmates and staff at Cook County Jail, the sprawling warehouse of the poor and dispossessed on the West Side of Chicago," Jackson said. "As I looked out over the faces crowded into the jail's gym, I saw tliat they were overwhelmingly Black and Brown. Although African-Americans make up just 24 percent of the population of Cook County, nearly 74 percent of the jail's population is Black."
Sharpton, after noting tliat his eldest daughter, Dominique, had given birth to liis grandson, recited a litany of police abuse in which Afncan-Amencans were victims. "We were in Sacramento in March where Stephon Clark was shot and killed by two officers," he said. "We were in Mobile, Ala. for the police manhandling of Chikesia Clemons and in the 'Stand Your Ground' incident in Clearwater, Fla. We will be there long after the cameras are gone."
Jackson closed his op-ed by his trademark "Keep Hope Alive." "But in the meantime, he concluded, "we the people- red, Brown, yellow, Black and white-must do what AfricanAmericans have done for 400 years, from bondage to emancipation, from lynch mobs to great migrations, from the back of the bus to Rosa Parks, from the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel in Memphis to President Barack Obama on the balcony of the White House."
Two clarion voices with a common message, one tliat each has been delivering from year to year, and time has not muted or stifled their resolve to speak truth to power, and to remind us of the struggle ahead.

Bernie Sanders apologizes to women who felt mistreated during 2016 campaign

Texto completo: Senator Bernie Sanders, Independent of Vermont, offered a public apology Wednesday night to female staffers who felt mistreated during his 2016 presidential campaign and said he was unaware at the time of allegations of sexual harassment and pay disparities.
"I certainly apologize to any woman who felt that she was not treated appropriately, and of course if I run, we will do better next time," Sanders said in a television interview.
The allegations have surfaced in multiple media reports as Sanders mulls a second bid for the Democratic nomination. During an appearance on CNN, he was asked about a New York Times story that detailed episodes of sexual harassment and demeaning treatment that women working for his campaign said were not sufficiently addressed.
Sanders said he was "very proud of the campaign we ran in 2016" but described an operation that "exploded" from just a few paid staffers to more than 1,200 employees in a matter of months.
"I am not going to sit here and tell you that we did everything right in terms of human resources, in terms of addressing the needs that I'm hearing from now, that women felt disrespected, that there was sexual harassment which was not dealt with as effectively as possible," Sanders told CNN's Anderson Cooper.
Sanders said safeguards were put in place during his 2018 campaign for reelection to the Senate.

Webb, former Democratic senator, could lead Defense
WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is considering Jim Webb, former Democratic senator and Reagan-era secretary of the Navy, to be the next defense secretary, according to three officials, potentially bypassing more hawkish Republicans whose names have been floated to replace Jim Mattis.
Webb, an outspoken opponent of the Iraq War, is being considered as President Trump seeks to carry out campaign promises to withdraw US troops from Syria and Afghanistan. Those two decisions prompted Mattis to resign in late December, putting Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan, a former Boeing executive, in the top role in an acting capacity.
Representatives for Vice President Mike Pence and acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney have reached out to Webb, one of the three officials said. Separately, a senior Defense Department official confirmed that Webb's name had been circulating at the White House. Those two and the third official all spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the internal discussions.
Webb did not respond to a request for comment.

Justice checking on Zinke's truthfulness
WASHINGTON — The Justice Department's public integrity section is examining whether newly departed Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke lied to his agency's inspector general investigators, according to three people familiar with the matter, a potential criminal violation that would exacerbate Zinke's legal woes.
Zinke, who left the Trump administration Wednesday, was facing two inspector general inquiries tied to his real estate dealings in his home state of Montana and his involvement in reviewing a proposed casino project by Native American tribes in Connecticut. In the course of that work, inspector general investigators came to believe Zinke had lied to them, and they referred the matter to the Justice Department to consider whether any laws were violated, the people familiar with the matter said.
The department's public integrity section has since been exploring the case, the people familiar with the matter said. The extent of its work is unclear, though the inspector general had questioned witnesses in an apparent attempt to scrutinize Zinke's account, one of the people said.
A spokesman for Zinke said Zinke voluntarily participated in two inspector general interviews about the Connecticut tribal matter and "to the best of his knowledge answered all questions truthfully."

Obama's 'Hamilton' track hits Billboard charts
Former president Barack Obama might be used to topping polls, but now he's charting new territory: He's a performer on a song that just hit Billboard's hot R&B songs chart. His performance on the remix of the "Hamilton" hit "One Last Time," featuring cast member Christopher Jackson and gospel singer BeBe Winans, made its debut at No. 22 on the list.
Obama and company dropped the track before Christmas as part of "Hamilton" creator Lin-Manuel Miranda's "Hamildrops," remixes featuring various celebrities, with proceeds going to charity.
The "One Last Time" entry is called the "44 Remix," on which Obama reads a passage from George Washington's farewell address.
Beating out the 44th president on the chart are some of his own friends, including John Legend and Stevie Wonder with "What Christmas Means to Me" at No. 16.

Texto completo: ALBANY – Former Vice President Joseph Biden has the "best case" for the Democratic nomination for president in 2020, according to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.
Cuomo, a Democrat, offered an endorsement Wednesday of a potential Biden presidential campaign, arguing that the Delaware Democrat has "credibility" with the American public.
The governor, who has denied interest in running in 2020 himself, made the comment after he was asked about Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren's presidential prospects.
"My two cents? I think of all the names that are out there, I think Joe Biden has the best case," Cuomo said on WAMC-FM (90.3) in Albany. "I think Joe Biden has the best case because he brings the most of the secret ingredient you need to win, which is credibility."
Cuomo was asked whether he might want to be Biden's running mate, but demurred.
"I am not even focusing on any of that," Cuomo said. "What I'm doing is what I believe I need to do for this state."
Longtime allies Cuomo has long counted Biden as a powerful ally.
Biden delivered a speech endorsing Cuomo for re-election at the state Democratic Convention in May, praising him for pushing big infrastructure projects and emphasizing the need to get things done.
Prior to that, Biden has made trips to New York to hail Cuomo for increasing the minimum wage and mark the groundbreaking on improvements at LaGuardia Airport.
Cuomo, who was inaugurated for a third term Tuesday night, has repeatedly denied he will run for president himself, saying in an August debate that he would serve a full four-year term "unless God strikes me dead."
Gillibrand weighing run Another New Yorker, U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of Brunswick, has said she's exploring a bid for the Democratic nomination in 2020.
The New York Times reported last week that Gillibrand has been weighing potential campaign managers and a location for a headquarters, likely to be in upstate New York.
On Wednesday, Cuomo said the potentially huge field of Democratic presidential candidates should work on highlighting the positives of their work.
"I think the main issue for the Democrats is not going to be the articulation of the negative," Cuomo said. "It's going to be the articulation of the positive and the credibility of the positive."
The governor said Biden was best suited to do that.
"You don't hire an airline pilot who has never flown a plane," Cuomo said. "Where is the credibility in your argument? Joe Biden can say, 'I was there. I was not the president, but I was the second seat.'"

Texto completo: Saudi Arabia denied Wednesday that it had issued American-made weapons to Sudanese soldiers in Yemen, disputing statements made by five of the soldiers and reported last week in The New York Times.
In an article about Sudanese soldiers fighting for the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, five Sudanese fighters who had returned from the conflict said that at training camps in Saudi Arabia they had been issued "modern" weapons that were unfamiliar to them and that they believed to be American-made.
In a statement on Wednesday, Saudi Arabia said an examination determined that American-made weapons had "never been distributed to personnel participating from Sudan as part of the coalition's operations."
The kingdom has not disclosed what weapons it distributed to the Sudanese fighters or where those weapons originated.
The five Sudanese fighters and a sixth who was about to depart for Yemen also said that their units had included many boys between the ages of 14 and 18. One of the fighters, Hager Shomo Ahmed, who turned 16 in December, said that he had fought for the Saudi coalition in Yemen in 2017 at the age of 14.
A spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition quoted in the article, Turki al-Malki, denied the presence of any children among its forces, calling those assertions "fictitious and unfounded."
The Saudi statement on Wednesday reiterated that denial. "The kingdom examined the records of all military personnel that have been deployed through Saudi Arabia as part of military operations in Yemen and has determined that there are no underage personnel," the statement said.
The statement said that critics should focus on the Saudi enemy in Yemen, the Iran-allied Houthis, whose "forced recruitment of children is well documented by international organizations."

Texto completo: Margaret and Lovell Lee raised their family with a few simple guidelines: Work hard for your education and your employer. Eat dinner together. And help others who need assistance.
So when their son, Lovell Lee Jr., changed colleges to major in adolescent education, it was a sign they had successfully instilled one of their key values in their children.
"I always wanted to be a public relations specialist or a broadcaster," the junior Mr. Lee, 19, said, "but I found out we need a lot more men of color inside our classrooms." He added, "There's a low representation of minorities teaching minorities and helping them get out of systemic problems."
His sisters (they're triplets) are also pursuing careers in service: Jamie Tanaka Lee is studying sociology at the State University of New York, Plattsburgh, and Talya Nicole Lee is enrolled at Hostos Community College and plans to go into nursing.
Caring for others has always been a core value of the close-knit "Lee Unit," as the family calls itself.
"Anybody that comes into the house, you can get clothes put on your back, your stomach is full, we accept anybody," said Talya Lee. "We're just caring people."
But giving back hasn't always been easy.
"Living in New York public housing is not fun. It's a struggle," the triplets' mother, Mrs. Lee, said in her living room in the Castle Hill neighborhood of the Bronx. "They don't really afford working parents anything. We've got to work hard to live here."
Mrs. Lee, 48, a preschool teacher, said she and her husband, 44, who now works on underground utility lines for Con Edison, had to balance the demands of raising a family with the difficulties of living paycheck-to-paycheck. In addition to the triplets, they also helped raise Mrs. Lee's son from a previous relationship, who is now 30, and his son, who is 11 and lives with the Lees.
Even with tight finances, the couple prioritized family time. Most nights, the Lees had dinner together. When the children were younger, one parent almost always dropped them off and picked them up from school -- even if it meant reduced work hours.
Mr. and Mrs. Lee carefully budgeted every paycheck to meet their expenses and buy household necessities. Their children started working as soon as they could to help support the family.
"Before we started working, we never really saw the sacrifices our parents had to make," Mr. Lee Jr. said. "Parents always feel like they have to do more, they want to do more, but they can't. And when we can relieve some of that burden, it's a good feeling."
During their time at the Fannie Lou Hamer Freedom High School, the triplets were enrolled in service-learning programs in addition to their jobs. The programs gave them even more independence and opened the door to new kinds of experiences, like working with some of the city's professional sports teams at Madison Square Garden.
"The programs really helped because I was really, really shy," Jamie Lee said. "Before these programs, I don't think I would have gone away to college."
Her parents had hoped the new experiences would open a world for the children outside of their neighborhood in the Bronx, and they are grateful to see the triplets all thriving as college freshmen.
"We got them out of here, and soon we'll be out of here, and those are the goals we're looking for, to get out of here," Mrs. Lee said.
Her husband agreed. "When they advance, we advance," he said. The two explained how, by going to college, the triplets could help make the whole family more financially secure.
Now that the Lees cannot regularly eat dinner together, they keep in touch and try to support one another through technology. And although it has been hard for the triplets to be farther away, they feel they have settled into their routine as college students.
"We've been living with that mind-set," Talya Lee said. "Everything's been about school, so getting into college and everything wasn't hard."
In addition to their familial moral support, the triplets said scholarships, and assistance from Children's Aid, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, were a major help in getting them to college. Over the summer, they received gift cards for $1,269.97 for school supplies and dorm necessities like bedding. Ms. Jamie Lee also received $223.50 for textbooks.
They were happy to be reunited for the holidays during college breaks. And Mrs. Lee said in an interview last month that she wished the family would always be together.
"If you left it up to me, I just would want a big giant house and still have everyone in their rooms, that's what I'd want," she said. "I don't want anybody to leave, but I know they have to move, and they have to live their own lives."
Donations to the Neediest Cases may be made online, or with a check or over the phone.

Tlaib chose special Koran for swearing in

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – When Rashida Tlaib stands on Thursday for her ceremonial swearing-in as the first Palestinian-American woman elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, it will be with her hand on a copy of the Koran.
But this won't be just any Koran: She will use Thomas Jefferson's personal copy of George Sale's 1734 translation of the Koran into English, a two-volume work that resides in the Library of Congress.
"It's important to me because a lot of Americans have this kind of feeling that Islam is somehow foreign to American history," said Tlaib, who also will become, with Minnesota's Ilhan Omar, one of the first two Muslim women sworn into the U.S. House. "Muslims were there at the beginning. ... Some of our founding fathers knew more about Islam than some members of Congress now."
She won't be surprised, however, if her using the Koran raises hackles for some people who believe she shouldn't be allowed to do so. Twelve years ago, when U.S. Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn., used the same Koran for his swearing-in as Congress' first Muslim member, some commentators argued that only a Bible was suitable for the purpose.
Already, conservative pastor and radio commentator E.W. Jackson has complained following Tlaib's and Omar's elections that, "The floor of Congress is now going to look like an Islamic republic" and argued that the U.S. is a "Judeo-Christian country."
Tlaib, a Detroit Democrat who was elected to the seat formerly held by U.S. Rep. John Conyers, said she's unfazed by comments such as Jackson's and expects that the objections will extend well beyond her being sworn into office the first week of January, even though she says she's far more concerned with economic and environmental help for her constituents than pushing any religious agenda.
"My mere existence, that I'm even of Muslim faith, is going to be a problem for them with or without me swearing in on any Koran."
No book, of any kind, is needed for a member's swearing-in Contrary to some beliefs, there is no requirement that new members of Congress be sworn in on the Bible or any other book. In fact, when they are officially sworn in, no book at all is used, though each member can hold one — any one — if they wish.
As the New York Times once put it, one could use "a comic book, a lesser Shakespeare play or nothing at all" for the function.
That official swearing-in happens at the beginning of every new Congress, around noon on Jan. 3, shortly after the election of the House speaker, who then asks the members to rise together, raise their right hands and take the oath of office, required by the Constitution and written into law:
"Do you solemnly swear that you will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that you will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that you take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that you will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which you are about to enter, so help you God?"
The members respond en masse: "I do," after which they are, officially, members of Congress.
After that, however, new U.S. House members generally attend individual — and ceremonial — swearings-in inside the speaker's office. Flanked by family and friends, the new member stands with the speaker for a photo, often placing one hand on the Bible and raising his or her other hand — though again, no book is mandated, no book is required.
It's at this ceremonial swearing-in that Tlaib will use Jefferson's Koran.
Jefferson's Koran dates to his days in law school That Koran — otherwise known in Sale's work as the Alcoran of Mohammed — is an edition that represents the first English translation of the text in North America and one that Jefferson purchased as a law student at the College of William & Mary in 1765.
And while there are no existing examples of Jefferson citing this Koran, it's thought that he bought it at a time when it might have been useful to his studies under noted law professor George Wythe, said Chris Warren, with the Rare Book & Special Collections Division at the Library of Congress.
"He probably purchased it because he was studying law and to get a better understanding on Islam's influence on the legal systems of the world," Warren said. "Jefferson wasn't only thinking about and studying western law ... a lot of those (early American) tenets come from places like the Bible and the Koran and the Old Testament."
He noted that Jefferson wrote Virginia's Statute on Religious Freedom — and intended it to apply to Muslims, Hindus and Jews as well as Christians — and that a large number of slaves brought into the U.S. were Muslim, which could also have piqued the interest of Jefferson, who was a slave owner.
"Islamic people have been in this country as long as everybody else, one way or another," added Warren.
The volume isn't entirely pristine — it was rebound in the early 1900s — but it's in good shape, said Warren. As for Tlaib's using it at her ceremonial swearing-in, it's no problem, though someone from the Library of Congress will have to bring it to the event and stay with it. Considering that it belonged to Jefferson — and was one of the 6,487 volumes he sold to the library for nearly $24,000 after its holdings were burned by the British in 1814 — it's virtually priceless.
"One of us will escort the volume," he said. "It's not just like we give it to them and say bring it back when you're done. ... We tend not to leave it out of sight for too long."
She's making a large point about diversity by using the Koran So far, there has been little indication of protests or overt denunciations of Tlaib's using Jefferson's Koran. For instance, an email to conservative radio show host Dennis Prager — who, during the fight over Ellison's use of the Koran, wrote an article decrying it — went unanswered when asking about Tlaib's intentions.
That's not to say it might not be coming, however, as the time for Tlaib's swearing-in — which she plans to attend in a traditional Palestinian dress, known as a thobe, made by her mother — gets closer. Tlaib has already been challenging tradition by trying to arrange a visit to the West Bank for members of Congress to draw attention to conditions there.
New members are typically invited on a trip to the Middle East by a pro-Israel group, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or AIPAC.
Twelve years ago, the criticism was thick, however. Prager wrote an article saying Ellison — who was born in Detroit and is about to become the new attorney general in Minnesota — should be stopped from using the Koran, saying it "undermines American civilization."
Former U.S. Rep. Virgil Goode, R-Va., sent a letter to his own constituents criticizing Ellison and saying, "I fear that in the next century we will have many more Muslims in the United States if we do not adopt the strict immigration policies that I believe are necessary to preserve the values and beliefs traditional to the United States of America."
But the swearing-in went without a hitch.
As for Tlaib — a former state representative, lawyer and civic activist — her using the Koran is not intended to make a religious point, but a legal one.
"I believe in secular government (and) my swearing in on the Koran is about me showing that the American people are made up of diverse backgrounds and we all have love of justice and freedom," she said. "My faith has centered me. The prophet Mohammed was always talking about freedom and justice."

Texto completo: If Republicans have a lick of sense, they are alarmed by a recent sign of intelligent life in the other party. The sign is the election by Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives of Illinois Rep. Cheri Bustos as chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. In November she won a fourth term by 24 percentage points, the largest margin of any Democrat running in a district Donald Trump carried in 2016. Her task as chair, which is to cement the Democrats' House majority in 2020, involves this arithmetic:
In the next Congress, 31 Democrats will represent districts Trump carried. In 2018, 40 Democrats flipped districts from red to blue - 41, if the Democrat wins the North Carolina race clouded by allegations of vote fraud. Twenty-two Democrats won by 5 percentage points or less. Twenty-three lost by 5 points or less. Democrats have noticed that Bustos prospers in a mostly rural district that extends along the Mississippi from the Wisconsin border to a portion of Peoria. Sixty percent of the district's residents live in towns with populations of 1,000 or fewer, 85 percent are in towns of 5,000 or fewer. In November, she won all of her district's 14 counties, 11 of which are entirely rural.
What lessons can Democrats learn from her success among Trump voters? They might start by marrying a cop. She says she gets "instant credibility" by telling audiences that her husband, who has been in law enforcement for 34 years, is the sheriff of Rock Island County. Regarding guns, it is helpful if one of your sons finished second in the national collegiate trap-shooting competition. It also is helpful if another son is a union welder.
Favorable trends might tempt Democrats to think that that they can thrive without the voters Bustos reaches. The magazine The Economist, noting that Trump's approval rating is "stratified by age," reports that baby boomers - those born between 1946 and 1964 - who have been America's largest age cohort for more than five decades will in 2019 be outnumbered by millennials, those born between 1981 and 1996.
Boomers are - were, they are shuffling off stage - almost 75 percent white; millennials are 56 percent white. In this year's midterm elections, Democrats won two-thirds of voters ages 18 to 29, and 71 percent of millennial women.
Furthermore, the Republican Party, which thinks of itself as the redoubt of the devout, is competing in an increasingly secular country. The Economist says that "Nones" - people with no religion - "already outnumber Catholics and mainline Protestants," and in 2019 might outnumber evangelicals. "There will soon be more Nones than any single group of Christians." Ex-Catholics are 13 percent of the American population.
Furthermore, The New York Times reports that with the Democrats' capture of New York's 11th Congressional District, which includes Staten Island and part of Brooklyn, Republicans now hold no "truly urban" district. Since Republicans lost four Orange County, California, seats in November - the Democrats lost only two seats nationally - come January there will be no Republican from there in Congress for the first time since 1940. And there will be no Republican U.S. representatives from New England.
If, however, Democrats aspire to be less of a coastal party - come January, there will be more House Democrats from California than from 36 other states combined - they should want to emulate Bustos' success among voters she calls "Trump triers," those who are less than his devoted acolytes.
Republicans can hope that in 2020, with Trump presumably at the top of their ticket, the turnout will be much larger and very unlike that of 2018. But analyst Charlie Cook, citing Michael McDonald of the United States Elections Project, says the 2018 turnout of 50.1 percent was the highest of any midterm election since 1914. David Wasserman of the Cook Political Report says Republicans lost 96 percent of House contests in districts Trump either lost or carried by less than 7 points.
Bustos sometimes connects with her constituents by asking them what they do for fun. When one woman answered "cable television," Bustos asked if her family did not go out to movies. No, the woman replied, four tickets and popcorn exceed the family's budget. This answer spoke volumes about the constituent's disposable income.
Bustos' question revealed a well-honed political intuition. Democrats, she says, have to "own" districts like hers, "not rent them." This is what ownership looks like: Her four margins of victory have been 6 percentage points, 11, 20 and 24.

A Subject Refuses to Be Dull

Texto completo: In her memoir "Slow Days, Fast Company" (1977), Eve Babitz described the joys of "4/60 air conditioning," which is what you get when you're on the freeway with all four windows down and you're traveling at 60 miles per hour.
The best of Babitz's writing keeps the windows cranked down, too, and she is always moving at speed. The recent rediscovery and reissue of her books -- her memoirs are especially resonant -- has been a deep pleasure to witness.
Lili Anolik helped jump-start the Babitz revival five years ago when she published a warm retrospective of the author's life in Vanity Fair. Anolik is back now with "Hollywood's Eve: Eve Babitz and the Secret History of L.A.," an expansion of that profile.
Don't arrive here in search of a proper biography. Anolik warns us up front that she "won't attempt to impose narrative structure and logic" on Babitz's life. Further, she "doesn't believe, or expect you to, that facts, dates, timelines, firsthand accounts, verifiable sources tell the tale."
This is awkward. When did "logic" and "facts" and "firsthand accounts" get such a bad rap? (Did I miss a memo?) Anolik makes a show of tossing her car's steering wheel out the window at the first turn.
The resulting book is good and bad in almost equal measure. It's good because Anolik has an instinctive grasp of why Babitz mattered as a writer and because, despite her apparent protestations to the contrary, she's done her homework. "Hollywood's Eve" fills in many of the gaps in our knowledge of Babitz's life and work.
It's bad because it's so breezily written, as if willing itself to become a work of what used to be called the New Journalism, that "4/60" does not begin to cover it. Reading it, you feel you're taking part in three conversations, two on call-waiting.
Anolik's book is filled with interjections such as "I've got to break in here, say something" and "Hang on a second" and "Wait, I want to withdraw that statement" and "Now, look sharp because things are about to take a turn for the funky." Her insights deserve better than this flip tone.
What "Hollywood's Eve" has going for it on every page is its subject's utter refusal to be dull. "I think I'm going to be an adventuress," Babitz reports saying as a child to her mother, in "Eve's Hollywood" (1974), her first memoir. "Is it all right?" It was, and it is.
Babitz grew up under the Hollywood sign. Her father was first violinist for the 20th Century-Fox orchestra and the Los Angeles Philharmonic, and her mother was an artist. Her godfather was Igor Stravinsky. "He's been slipping you glasses of Scotch under the table since you turned 13," Anolik writes, "and his wife, the peerlessly elegant Vera, taught you how to eat caviar."
When she was barely out of her teens, Babitz posed for a now-famous photograph of herself playing chess with Marcel Duchamp. He was clothed; she was naked. Babitz was beautiful and wild and opinionated.
She was a star of Los Angeles's bohemian art and music crowds. "Eve was our Kiki of Montparnasse," the artist Ed Ruscha said. She designed album covers for Buffalo Springfield and the Byrds. She seduced Jim Morrison and many others. Among them was the writer Dan Wakefield, who commented: "Men didn't conquer Eve Babitz, she conquered them."
Babitz was 28 and approaching burnout (she termed it "squalid overboogie") when she began to write in earnest. With the help of Joan Didion, a friend, she sold an essay to Rolling Stone in 1971. Babitz being Babitz, she slept with Grover Lewis, her Rolling Stone editor, and later with the editor of her first book.
Didion's intervention is interesting because it's among this book's contentions that Babitz's literary career was a reaction to that of her famous friend. Where Didion took a fundamentally dark view of Los Angeles, Babitz had a feel for her hometown's charms and celebrated them.
Anolik's writing about Didion and Babitz is graceful until it isn't. At one point she writes, referring to an earlier conversation with Babitz: "Now, I suppose, is the time to come clean. Eve was right. I do have homicidal designs on Didion. I think 'Play It"' -- Didion's novel "Play It as It Lays" -- "is a silly, shallow book. I think 'Slow Days' should replace it, become the new essential reading for young women (and young men) seeking to understand L.A. There. I said it."
Babitz had affairs with Warren Zevon and Annie Leibovitz and Steve Martin. (She advised Martin to wear white suits.) She once wrote a letter to Joseph Heller, the author of "Catch-22," that contained two sentences: "I am a stacked 18-year-old blonde on Sunset Boulevard. I am also a writer." She spent the entirety of her first book advance on a big meal at her favorite restaurant, Musso & Frank Grill, ordering the caramel custard for everyone in the house.
Her books -- there were memoirs, and then novels -- never sold very well. She did too much cocaine. She wrote a screenplay for the Eagles, and when they delayed paying her she threatened to kill herself. (They paid.) She got into Alcoholics Anonymous in the early '80s.
Babitz suffered third-degree burns over much of her body in a freak accident in 1997, when she tried to light a cigar in her car, a VW Bug that Steve Martin had bought her, and her skirt and pantyhose caught fire. She essentially disappeared from public life. She is now 75. Anolik tracked her down in Los Angeles, where she listens to right-wing talk radio and mostly lives like a recluse.
Anolik sometimes verges on condescending to Babitz ("what a sport and a champ and a trouper"). But she's a sensitive reader of her work and owns a sly wit. About the nude photo with Duchamp, for example, Anolik writes: "She might have something on -- the radio, for example, or Chanel No. 5."
In "Slow Days, Fast Company," Babitz observed that "the best way to approach anything was to be introduced by the right person." Anolik's book succeeds in its primary mission: It sends you racing to read the work of Eve Babitz.
