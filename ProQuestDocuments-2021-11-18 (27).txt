Texto completo: In Sunday's episode of “Last Week Tonight," host John Oliver discussed the impeachment inquiry into President Trump and compared the ongoing scandal with the fallout around Robert Mueller's report.
Oliver recapped the road to the House's impeachment inquiry and noted that after the complicated nature of Mueller's 22-month investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 US election, the Ukraine inquiry seems simple.
“Trump pressuring Ukraine to get dirt on his opponent and then hiding the conversation is easy to understand," Oliver said. “It's just gettable."
Where the Mueller report discussed Trump surrogates dealing with Russians and an obtuse web of interactions, the Ukraine inquiry involves Trump pressuring Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy for political support, Oliver explained, and that's obviously “something presidents should absolutely not be able to do."
The Ukraine inquiry, which Oliver titled “Stupid Watergate II: The Stupidest Watergate," — in reference to his title for the Mueller affair — also involves a “thorough" abuse of power, the host said, especially because of the work of Rudy Giuliani, Trump's lawyer.
Citing a New York Times story from May, Oliver pointed out that Giuliani was headed to Russia explicitly to push the incoming government to investigate Mueller and former vice president Joe Biden, who was the subject of Trump's call with Zelenskiy.
“We're meddling in an investigation," Giuliani told the Times.
“He did this in plain sight," Oliver exclaimed.
The straightforward nature of Ukraine affair, Oliver argued, may mean the president will face political consequences — and yes, Oliver said, he holds that opinion despite the fact that Trump has largely avoided congressional disciplining following the release of Mueller's report.

Texto completo: The images are horrific. Children, some just 3 or 4 years old, being sexually abused and in some cases tortured.
Pictures of child sexual abuse have long been produced and shared, but it has never been like this: Technology companies reported a record 45 million online photos and videos of the abuse last year.
More than a decade ago, when the reported number was less than 1 million, the proliferation of the explicit imagery had already reached a crisis point. Tech companies, law enforcement agencies and legislators in Washington responded, committing to new measures meant to rein in the scourge. Landmark legislation passed in 2008.
Yet the explosion in detected content kept growing — exponentially.
An investigation by The New York Times found an insatiable criminal underworld that had exploited the flawed and insufficient efforts to contain it.
A paper recently published in conjunction with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children described a system at “a breaking point,” with reports of abusive images “exceeding the capabilities of independent clearinghouses and law enforcement to take action.” It suggested that future advancements in machine learning might be the only way to catch up with criminals.
In interviews, victims across the United States described in heart-wrenching detail how their lives had been upended by the abuse. Many of the survivors and their families said their view of humanity had been inextricably changed by the crimes themselves and the online demand for images of them.
“I don’t really know how to deal with it,” said one woman who, at age 11, had been filmed being sexually assaulted by her father. “You’re just trying to feel OK and not let something like this define your whole life. But the thing with the pictures is — that’s the thing that keeps this alive.”
The Times’ reporting revealed a problem global in scope but one firmly rooted in the United States because of the central role Silicon Valley has played in facilitating the imagery’s spread and in reporting it to authorities. While the material, commonly known as child pornography, predates the digital era, smartphone cameras, social media and cloud storage have allowed images to multiply at an alarming rate.
In a particularly disturbing trend, online groups are devoting themselves to sharing images of younger children and more extreme forms of abuse. The groups use encrypted technologies and the dark web, the vast underbelly of the internet, to teach pedophiles how to carry out the crimes and how to record and share images of the abuse worldwide.
After years of uneven monitoring of the material, several major tech companies stepped up surveillance of their platforms. Executives with some companies pointed to the voluntary monitoring and the spike in reports as indications of their commitment to addressing the problem.
But police records and emails, as well as interviews with local, state and federal law enforcement officials, show that some tech companies still fall short. It can take weeks or months for them to respond to questions from authorities, if they respond at all. Sometimes they respond only to say they have no records, even for reports they initiated.
And when tech companies cooperate fully, encryption and anonymization can create digital hiding places for perpetrators. Facebook announced in March plans to encrypt Messenger, which last year was responsible for nearly 12 million of the 18.4 million worldwide reports of child sexual abuse material, according to people familiar with the reports. Reports to authorities typically contain more than one image, and last year encompassed the record 45 million photos and videos.
The law Congress passed in 2008 foresaw many of today’s problems, but the Times found that the federal government had not fulfilled major aspects of the legislation.
The Justice Department has produced just two of six required reports to compile data about internet crimes against children and set goals to eliminate them, and there has been a constant churn of short-term appointees leading the department’s efforts.
The federal government has also not lived up to the law’s funding goals. Congress has regularly allocated about half of the $60 million in yearly funding for state and local law enforcement efforts. Separately, the Department of Homeland Security this year diverted nearly $6 million from its cybercrimes units to immigration enforcement.
Further impairing the federal response are shortcomings at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which reviews reports it receives and then distributes them to federal, state and local law enforcement agencies, as well as international partners.
The nonprofit center has relied in large measure on 20-year-old technology, has difficulty keeping experienced engineers on staff and, by its own reckoning, regards stopping the online distribution of photos and videos secondary to rescuing children.
Covering Their Tracks
The videos found on the computer of an Ohio man and site administrator named Jason Gmoser were described by investigators as among “the most gruesome and violent images of child pornography.” The videos were stored in a hidden computer file and had also been encrypted.
Increasingly, criminals are using advanced technologies like encryption to stay ahead of police. In this case, the Ohio man, who helped run a website on the dark web known as the Love Zone, had more than 3 million photos and videos on his computers.
The site, now shuttered, had nearly 30,000 members and required them to share images of abuse to maintain good standing, according to court documents. A private section of the forum was available only to members who shared imagery of children they abused themselves.
Multiple police investigations have broken up enormous dark web forums, including one known as Child’s Play that was reported to have had over 1 million user accounts.
Offenders can cover their tracks by connecting to virtual private networks, which mask their locations; deploying encryption techniques, which can hide their messages and make their hard drives impenetrable; and posting on the dark web, which is inaccessible to conventional browsers.
The anonymity offered by the sites emboldens members to post images of very young children being sexually abused, and in increasingly extreme and violent forms.
Exhibits in the Love Zone case include screenshots showing the forum had dedicated areas where users discussed ways to remain “safe” while posting and downloading imagery.
Testimony in Gmoser’s criminal case revealed that it would have taken authorities “trillions of years” to crack the 41-character password he had used to encrypt the site. He eventually turned it over and was sentenced to life in prison in 2016.
‘Truly Terrible Things’
The surge in criminal activity on the dark web accounted for only a fraction of the 18.4 million reports of abuse last year. That number originates almost entirely with tech companies based in the United States.
Companies have known for years that their platforms were being co-opted by predators, but many of them essentially looked the other way. And while many companies have made recent progress in identifying the material, they were slow to respond.
The recent surge by tech companies in filing reports of online abuse “wouldn’t exist if they did their job then,” said Hemanshu Nigam, a former federal prosecutor in cybercrime and child exploitation cases who now runs a cybersecurity consulting firm.
“The companies knew the house was full of roaches, and they were scared to turn the lights on,” said Hany Farid, who worked with Microsoft to develop technology in 2009 for detecting child sexual abuse material. “And then when they did turn the lights on, it was worse than they thought.”
Federal law requires companies to preserve material about their reports of abuse imagery for 90 days. But given the overwhelming number of reports, it is not uncommon for requests from authorities to reach companies too late.
Most tech companies have been quick to respond to urgent inquiries, but responses in other cases vary significantly. Police officers in Missouri, New Jersey, Texas and Wisconsin pointed to Tumblr, a blogging and social networking site with 470 million users, as one of the most problematic companies, lamenting Tumblr’s poor response to requests.
Law enforcement officials also pointed to problems with Microsoft’s Bing search engine, and Snap, the parent company of the social network Snapchat. Bing was said to regularly submit reports that lacked essential information, making investigations difficult. Snapchat is engineered to delete most of its content within a short period of time.
Facebook has long known about abusive images on its platforms, including a video of a man sexually assaulting a 6-year-old that went viral last year on Messenger. When Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, announced in March that Messenger would move to encryption, he acknowledged the risk it presented for “truly terrible things like child exploitation.”
‘Vastly Inadequate ’
Annual funding for state and regional investigations was authorized at $60 million, but only about half of that is regularly approved. It has increased only slightly from 10 years ago when accounting for inflation. Even $60 million a year would now be vastly inadequate.
And even the most recent biennial strategy reports published by the Justice Department, in 2010 and 2016, did not include data about some of the most pressing concerns, such as trade in illicit imagery.
When the law Congress passed in 2008 was reauthorized in 2012, the coordinator role was supposed to be elevated to a senior executive position. That has not happened.
The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children has also struggled with demands to contain the spread of the imagery.
As child exploitation has grown on the internet, the center has not kept up. The technology it uses for receiving and reviewing reports of the material was created in 1998. To perform key upgrades and help modernize the system, the group has relied on donations from tech companies like Palantir and Google.
The center has said it intends to make significant improvements to its technology starting in 2020, but the problems don’t stop there. Police complain that the most urgent reports are not prioritized, or are sent to the wrong department completely. And despite its mandate by Congress, the center is not subject to public records laws and operates with little transparency.
The Times found that there was a close relationship between the center and Silicon Valley that raised questions about governance practices. The center receives both money and in-kind donations from tech companies, while employees of the same companies are sometimes members of its board. That practice, those working in the area of child protection said, could elevate the interests of tech companies above the children’s.
The close relationship with tech companies may ultimately be in jeopardy. In 2016, a federal court held that the national center, though private, qualified legally as a government entity because it performed a number of essential government functions.
If that view gains traction, Fourth Amendment challenges about searches and seizures by the government could change how the center operates. And under those circumstances, if they were to collaborate too closely with the center, companies could also be viewed as government actors subject to new legal requirements and court challenges when they police their own sites.
An Ugly Mirror
It was a sunny afternoon in July, and an unmarked police van in Salt Lake City was parked outside a pink stucco house.
At the back of the van, a man who lived in the house was seated, while officers cataloged hard drives and sifted through web histories from his computers. The man had shared sexually explicit videos online, police said.
The year was barely half over, and the team of Chief Jessica Farnsworth, an official with the Utah attorney general’s office who led a raid of the house, had already conducted about 150 such raids across Utah. The specially trained group, one of 61 nationwide, coordinates responses to internet crimes against children.
The Utah group expects to arrest nearly twice as many people this year as last year, but federal funding has not kept pace. Funding for the 61 task forces from 2010 to 2018 remained relatively flat, federal data shows, while the number of leads referred to them increased by more than 400%.
Much of the federal money goes toward training new staff members because the cases take a heavy emotional and psychological toll on investigators, resulting in constant turnover.
The volume of work has also forced the task forces to make difficult choices. Some have focused on the youngest and most vulnerable victims, while others have cut back on undercover operations.
The internet is well known as a haven for hate speech, terrorism-related content and criminal activity, all of which have raised alarms and spurred public debate and action. But the problem of child sexual abuse gets scant attention because few people want to confront the enormity and horror of the content.
Some state lawmakers, judges and members of Congress have refused to discuss the problem in detail, or have avoided attending meetings and hearings, according to interviews with law enforcement officials and victims.
Steven Grocki, who leads the child exploitation and obscenity section at the Justice Department, said the reluctance was a societal problem. “They turn away from it because it’s too ugly of a mirror,” he said.
While the imagery is often defined as “child pornography,” experts prefer terms like child sexual abuse imagery or child exploitation material to underscore the seriousness of the crimes and to avoid conflating it with adult pornography.
“Each and every image is a depiction of a crime in progress,” said Sgt. Jeff Swanson, a task force commander in Kansas. “The violence inflicted on these kids is unimaginable.”

Texto completo: Buck has lived for decades in Southern California, and is known as a donor to Democratic politicians, as an animal-rights activist and as a benefactor to causes involving the LGBTQ community. But now he has been charged in connection with the deaths and near deaths of several men.
Buried deep in every news article about Ed Buck, described by federal and state prosecutors in California as a "violent, dangerous sexual predator," is a line like this one from The New York Times:
"Mr. Buck first rose to prominence in Arizona in the 1980s. Then a Republican, he led the Mecham Recall Committee, an effort to remove the Republican governor, Evan Mecham, from office."
Buck has lived for decades in Southern California, and is known as a donor to Democratic politicians, as an animal-rights activist and as a benefactor to causes involving the LGBTQ community. But now he has been charged in connection with the deaths and near deaths of several men.
In court documents, Los Angeles County prosecutors said of Buck, "He mainly preys on men made vulnerable by addiction and homelessness. Using the bait of narcotics, money, and shelter, the defendant lures these vulnerable victims to his home. From his home, in a position of power, Buck manipulates his victims into participating in his sexual fetishes. These fetishes include supplying and personally administering dangerously large doses of narcotics to his victims."
It's not just creepy, it's grotesque.
Buck is 65, and if found guilty could spend the rest of his life in prison.
He is a tabloid sensation in Los Angeles, with each article containing that little footnote about his time years ago in Arizona.
I knew him then.
Ironically, it wasn't so much for his leadership in the Mecham recall movement, about which I was writing constantly, but for an act of singular grace that Buck and the volunteers in his group performed for a teenager I had gotten to know.
It began out of the blue one morning when I received a call from 17-year-old Jon Fladhammer, who said he had some free time during the day and wanted to know if I could put him in touch with the Mecham Recall Committee.
Why would a person who should be in high school have free time during the day? I asked.
"Because I'm dying," Jon said.
It was 1987. He'd had cancer for several years by then. He'd lost a leg to it. Now it was in his lungs and he had a few months left.
"One of my philosophies is that, you know, it's happening, so you might as well laugh with it," he told me. And he did, fighting the disease by way of his loving family, painkillers, Marx Brothers movies and an unrelenting sense of optimism.
Jon did not spend his time dying.
He spent it living.
I called Buck and told him Jon's story. Buck and the recall committee sprang into action.
They picked up Jon at his home and took him to their office whenever he was up to it.
Everyone there treated him, to his great glee, like a smart and smart-alecky little brother.
Jon worked on the recall effort. Dozens of articles were written about him. He got on TV. On radio. He made a trip to Alaska.
He had hoped to go to law school or to become an actor. He imagined a career in politics.
The day after he learned he was dying, he left his mother a note on the refrigerator.
It read, "My dearest Mother, I really do love you very much. So, let's spend the rest of our time together in peace, love, harmony, and laughter."
And he did, until he no longer could.
Jon's memorial service wasn't referred to by his family as a funeral but as a "victory celebration." And it was.
And time passed.
I'd check in with Jon's amazing mother, Dana, now and then. She'd call or send an email on anniversaries. Years passed. Decades.
When the image of Ed Buck in a Los Angeles courtroom flashed on the TV recently I thought back to Sept. 24, 1987, the day of Jon's service, when we sat next to each other, along with the other pallbearers, in the first pew at Abiding Savior Lutheran Church in Tempe.

US-China trade stories influence markets

Texto completo: I have a new theory for you to consider. Renowned economist Robert Shiller's most recent book suggests investors may be able to predict and prepare for economic events by tracking popular stories. Applying his theory might have been a challenge last week. There were so many stories with potential to move markets and affect the economy it was difficult to guess which would be the most influential.
As it turned out, on-again-off-again trade negotiations provided the spark that drove markets lower. Barron's explained:
"The S&P 500 would have finished flat for the week – except it decided to drop 0.5 percent after reports that China had canceled a visit to Montana hit the newswires...That's not what we would have expected, given all of the weeks' excitement. Saudi Arabia's oil infrastructure was attacked. The Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter-point. U.S. money markets went crazy and forced the Fed to intervene, setting off comparisons to the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008. And, yet, a Montana junket was the ultimate determinant of whether the market finished up or down."
On Saturday, reports from U.S. trade representatives and China's state-run news agency emphasized trade discussions were 'constructive' and 'productive' and would continue in October, reported The New York Times. To strengthen the intrigue, it has subsequently been announced that China will buy 10,000 tons of U.S. pork. Perhaps, there is nothing like a herd of pigs to reduce world trade tensions.
Last week, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell mentioned trade wars 20 times in his news conference, reported The Wall Street Journal. "Other geopolitical risks figured less prominently or not at all. Mr. Powell mentioned Brexit once, and tensions in Hong Kong and Saudi Arabia didn't come up."
The Fed chair emphasized the Fed is using the tools at its disposal to support demand and counteract economic weakness. However, it has no way to resolve trade issues. He pointed out uncertainty about trade has reduced business investment across the United States and could hurt economic growth.
Until an agreement is reached, stories told about U.S.-China trade issues are likely to remain influential. As for me, if I could be "King for a Day" and have absolute authority (and knowing where you get most of your information) I would abolish all the news channels and perhaps replace them with meaningful things like Hallmark, Sports, intriguing whodunnits like 2020, 48 hours, etc. Please always remember that the 24-hour financial/political news cycle is designed to sell advertising by entertaining you, not provide you with actionable advice.
Now, while still on that soapbox, you should know that 73% of stocks owned by Americans are held by households headed by individuals over the age of 55. You would think that with our wisdom and experience we would know better about good sources for information! Perhaps we could learn from the younger generations. In fact, we don't all even agree about what we do or don't know. As of September 18, 2019, 35% of investors were optimistic on the prospects for the market over the next six months, 37% were neutral, and 28% were pessimistic. I guess it depends on what channel we watch. Let me know if you're curious and I'll tell you which way I think the wind is blowing.
In closing (on a positive note) here is some good news for my fellow "senior citizens". Social Security – has an annual "cost of living" adjustment based upon the year-over-year increase in prices from the 3rd quarter of subsequent years. For example, the raise that will be applied to benefits paid in January 2020 will be based on the change in prices from the end of the third quarter of 2018 to the end of the third quarter this year. Last year, the raise was 2.8%. Looks like you might be in for another minimal raise in January.

Texto completo: How the party revived an ancient philosophy to extol order and compel obedience.
When Chairman Mao Zedong stepped forward in Tiananmen Square on Oct. 1, 1949, and proclaimed -- in standard Chinese but in a thick Hunanese accent -- the founding of the People's Republic of China, many patriots rejoiced. A large number of Chinese who were not Communists were still happy that after years of humiliation by foreign powers, a vicious Japanese invasion and a bloody civil war, China was now finally united. For the first time in roughly a century the Chinese had regained their dignity. Mao was widely credited for this.
Many Chinese patriots would one day regret their enthusiasm. Mao not only turned against what he called "class enemies," or indeed anyone who did not follow him slavishly, but he also unleashed greater violence on the Chinese people than even the Japanese had. The Cultural Revolution, during which it is believed that up to two million people were murdered, was just the last of his great purges.
And yet, Mao's feat of unifying the country and restoring national pride is still a reason for many people in China to respect his legacy, and for the Chinese Communist Party (C.C.P.) to justify its continued monopoly on power. The fear of violent disorder runs deep and is consistently drummed into Chinese of all ages. Party propagandists insist that China without Communist rule would descend once more into chaos and fall prey to hostile foreign powers.
There are, however, other reasons the C.C.P. is still in power in China, even after Communist rule has collapsed almost everywhere else.
The party has adapted extremely well to capitalism. Seeing what happened to the Soviet Union after Mikhail Gorbachev's democratic reforms, China's rulers refused to follow his example. After the Chinese who demanded similar reforms were brutally crushed during the Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989, the C.C.P. made a tacit deal with the educated urban class from which most of the protesters came. One-party rule would create the orderly conditions for people to become wealthy, in exchange for which they would refrain from political protest.
In this sense, China is not so different from Singapore, where a similar deal has been struck, if in a somewhat less oppressive manner. In fact, Deng Xiaoping, considered to be China's great modern reformer and the man who cracked down on the dissidents in 1989, was an admirer of the Singaporean way of combining capitalism with autocracy.
But there is a deeper historical reason for the success of Communist Party rule in China. Imperial power in China was always backed by a quasi-religious dogma. Chinese emperors, acting as mediators between heaven and earth, were treated as semi-divine figures, holy popes as much as earthly rulers. Confucianism, originally a moral as well as a political philosophy, became an ideology imposed to instill obedience to authority -- from fathers in families to clan chiefs all the way up to the emperor.
This may not have been what Confucius, or his follower Mencius, had originally intended. They were more interested in the cultivation of virtue in scholar-officials and the proper observance of ethical rules: Ancient Confucianism is a kind of blueprint for harmonious social order. And the recent protests in Hong Kong, as well as a vibrant democracy in Taiwan, show that many Chinese are actively opposed to authoritarianism -- notably in places where traditional Chinese culture has generally been better preserved than on the mainland.
But rulers have used Confucianism, today no less than a thousand years ago, to support social hierarchy and autocratic rule. Official promoters of the creed have put an authoritarian spin on what started as a humanist philosophy.
This closed system based on orthodoxy was difficult for modern reformers to challenge, or disentangle. It was not enough to topple a particular imperial regime. To stage a real revolution in the name of democracy, which was attempted in the early decades of the 20th century, Chinese reformers felt it was necessary to sweep away the orthodoxy along with the sacred rulers.
That was the main point of the so-called May Fourth Movement of 1919, when students and intellectuals marched through the streets of Beijing under the banners "Mr. Science" and "Mr. Democracy." Confucianism, the ideology that had held Chinese culture and politics together for thousands of years, had to go. Science became for some Chinese thinkers a new kind of dogma, something that explained everything.
Many Chinese intellectuals of the May Fourth generation were attracted to Marxism for that very reason. It filled the post-Confucian vacuum with an alternative, modern political and scientific orthodoxy with a strong moral component. Liu Shaoqi, one of the early Communist leaders (who was later purged and left to rot in prison during the Cultural Revolution), wrote in 1939 a tract titled "How to Be a Good Communist." His description of the ideal revolutionary, with its stress on "self-cultivation," sounded remarkably Confucian.
Even after the founding of the People's Republic in 1949, the separation of church and state did not happen. Mao behaved like a divine emperor whose thoughts had to be learned by rote and revered like a classic Confucian text. Disrespecting or even just ignoring Mao's "Little Red Book" in the 1960s was treated as a form of blasphemy, for which a person could be sent for re-education in a gulag -- that is, if he or she had not been already executed.
After Mao died, and especially after Deng's capitalist reforms, Maoism and Marxism began to lose their potency. Party members paid lip service to the party orthodoxy, and children were still taught it at school, but nationalism, and even bits of warmed-over Confucianism, began to replace the old Communist dogma. This, too, created what some Chinese and experts describe as a "spiritual vacuum."
One way of filling the void has been conversion to Christianity, or joining spiritual groups like the Falun Gong, which party leaders view with great dismay. The reason the government tries so hard to crush religious organizations that operate independently from party control is precisely because dogmas that compete with the state orthodoxy are by definition subversive.
President Xi Jinping is very aware of this problem. That is why he is trying to tighten the party's grip on ideology, as well as revive Maoist thought, while cracking down on dissident thinking in universities, mass media and online. His personality cult, stressing firm paternal leadership, as well as the authority of his philosophic thoughts, is widely seen as a way to reinstate the Communist variety of imperial rule after years of government by a succession of bland technocrats.
Mr. Xi is no Chairman Mao, however; he lacks the charisma to be a modern emperor. But a harsher version of the Singaporean model could succeed for quite a long time. The C.C.P. will continue to justify its rule by standing for order, national greatness and something called "Socialism With Chinese Characteristics" while (some of) the people continue to get rich. The exact nature of this type of socialism is not so important, nor is whether people really believe in it. There were many schools of Confucianism, too. The important thing is that this form of socialism compels obedience. And as long as the party remains in power, state control of spiritual and intellectual life will prevent people from coming up with any viable alternative.

Texto completo: Images of child sex abuse have reached a crisis point on the internet, spreading at unprecedented rates in part because tech platforms and law enforcement agencies have failed to keep pace with the problem. But less is understood about the issue underlying it all: What drives people to sexually abuse children?
Science in recent years has begun to provide some answers. One thing most pedophiles have in common: They discover, usually as teenagers, that their sexual preferences have not matured like everyone else's. Most get stuck on the same-age boys or girls who first attracted them at the start of puberty, though some retain interest in far younger children.
"People don't choose what arouses them -- they discover it," said Dr. Fred Berlin, director of the Johns Hopkins Sex and Gender Clinic. "No one grows up wanting to be a pedophile."
[Read The New York Times's investigation into the spread of online child sex abuse .]
Over the past generation, psychologists, forensic specialists and others have studied pedophilia, a disorder characterized by "recurrent, intense arousing fantasies, urges or behaviors involving sexual activity with a prepubescent child," according to psychiatry's diagnostic manual. These experts have interviewed patients in depth, piecing together life histories and performing a variety of psychological and anatomical measures.
While no study offers a complete picture, a portrait is emerging -- one that helps elucidate the mental dynamic behind the surge in abuse images and the deepening depravity they depict. These findings also defy common stereotypes about what pedophilia is, and what the risks are for engaging in physical abuse.
A majority of convicted offenders are men who prey on children ages 6 to 17. But women also commit hands-on offenses; rough estimates put the rate of pedophilic attraction at 1 to 4 percent in both men and women. Studies suggest that a small subset of male and female pedophiles have an interest in toddlers, or even infants.
As scientists seek to understand how the disorder develops, there is growing consensus that the origin is largely biological. This view is based in part on studies pointing to subtle physical traits that have a higher incidence among pedophiles.
"The biological clues attached to pedophilia demonstrate that its roots are prenatal," said James Cantor, director of the Toronto Sexuality Center. "These are not genetic; they can be traced to specific periods of development in the womb."
Psychological and environmental factors may also contribute, though it is not yet clear what those are or how they interact with developmental conditions.
By contrast, the common presumption that pedophiles were themselves abused as children now has less support. Child victims are at far greater risk of future substance abuse, depression, persistent traumatic stress or criminal aggression than of becoming molesters. The vast majority of offenders deny any sex abuse in their childhood, even though they could garner sympathy in court by doing so, experts say. "A chaotic childhood increases the likelihood of a chaotic adulthood, of any kind," Dr. Cantor said.
The relationship between viewing or collecting images and committing hands-on abuse is a matter of continuing debate among some experts, and one that is critical to evaluating the risk an offender poses. Until recently, the prevailing view was that only a minority of people caught viewing such images, between 5 and 20 percent, also committed physical abuse.
That perception began to change in 2007, when a pair of psychologists at the Federal Bureau of Prisons reported that 85 percent of convicted online offenders acknowledged in therapy that they had raped or otherwise sexually abused children.
That finding circulated widely before the study was formally published, creating an uproar among therapists, researchers and law enforcement specialists. The prisons bureau balked at publishing it at all, and withdrew it from a peer-reviewed journal close to its release date.
Many cited concerns that the study sample was biased: It was based on the confessions of 155 convicts who had sought out therapy in prison, not on a representative sample of pedophiles, a much broader group with diverse habits.
"It was what we call a convenience sample -- that was a legitimate criticism," said Michael L. Bourke, a co-author of the study with Andres E. Hernandez, in a telephone interview. Dr. Bourke is now chief of the behavioral analysis unit of the United States Marshals.
Since then, several other studies have supported the prison finding, if not precisely the 85 percent number. In one, inspectors from an array of government agencies interviewed 127 online offenders shortly after their arrests. Less than 5 percent admitted to previously molesting at least one child.
When agents followed up with more in-depth, polygraph-assisted methods, another 53 percent admitted to hands-on offenses, for a total of nearly 60 percent.
"This was not a convenience sample; these were offenders, some of whom had downloaded just a single image, with no known history, from all over the country, interviewed by people from different agencies," Dr. Bourke said. "They had zero incentive to admit to a previous offense -- very much the opposite."
The high rate of previous, hands-on offending undermines another common assumption about pedophiles. "We shouldn't assume that viewing online images leads to abuse of a child victim in person," said Joe Sullivan, a specialist in sex crimes against children in Ireland and Britain. "In my clinical experience, it's the other way around. Most of these men have already committed hands-on offenses."
From this point of view, downloading abuse images -- and especially connecting with groups of like-minded pedophiles online -- does not awaken latent desires. The desires are very much awake and, in many cases, have already been acted on. But the images and online communities can help erode inhibitions further, drawing pedophiles into more frequent or more aggressive acts, Dr. Bourke said.
"What you see, in their search histories," he said, "is that they learn how to evade law enforcement, they become more confident and they begin to use cognitive distortions to overcome their moral inhibitions."
Some therapists and researchers say these findings from law enforcement threaten to unfairly tar people who never act on their desires. This group certainly exists -- they're sometimes called "virtuous pedophiles" -- but in an era of increasing alarm over the proliferation of online abuse, they are going only further underground.
"That is a shame, a tragedy," Dr. Cantor said. "That is the group we need to learn about. That's the kind of person we'd like our clients to become, a person who's aware of the urges and learns to effectively manage them."
Learning to manage a drive as visceral, and often consuming, as sexual desire is possible, therapists say, but it cannot be shut off; nor can it be replaced, the way heroin can be swapped for methadone. Treatment can require drugs that reduce circulating testosterone and software that limits online browsing habits.
Often, therapy addresses substance abuse as well. Studies suggest that at least 40 percent of sex offenders were using drugs or alcohol when they committed their crimes.
"The important thing, I think, is that people know that treatment is possible," Dr. Berlin said. "There's a subgroup out there, they refer themselves here, and they are quite convinced that they do not want real-life sex with children."

Texto completo: President Trump has long relied on repetition to spread his falsehoods into the national discourse. As the whistleblower complaint about his dealings with Ukraine has led to a possible impeachment crisis, he has repeated previously fact-checked claims about former vice president Joe Biden while introducing new ones. We've been trying to keep up at The Fact Checker, doling out lots of Pinocchios, but our online reports have been scattered over several days.
This is one of those complex stories that consume Washington but frequently confuse ordinary Americans. Trump appears to be counting on that confusion to offer a fog of claims to make it appear as if Biden had done something wrong. So here's a quick guide to Trump's statements - and the truth.

False: Biden pushed out a Ukrainian prosecutor investigating his son
Trump has falsely claimed that Biden in 2015 pressured the Ukrainian government to fire Viktor Shokin, the top Ukrainian prosecutor, because he was investigating Ukraine's largest private gas company, Burisma, which added Biden's son Hunter to its board in 2014.
There are two big problems with this claim: One, Shokin was not investigating Burisma or Hunter Biden, and two, Shokin's ouster was considered a diplomatic victory.
Biden was among many Western officials who pressed for the removal of Shokin because he actually was not investigating the corruption endemic to the country. Indeed, he was not investigating Burisma at the time. In September 2015, then-U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt publicly criticized Shokin's office for thwarting a British money-laundering probe into Burisma's owner, Mykola Zlochevsky.
"Shokin was not investigating. He didn't want to investigate Burisma," Daria Kaleniuk, of the Ukrainian Anti-Corruption Action Center, told The Washington Post in July. "And Shokin was fired not because he wanted to do that investigation, but quite to the contrary, because he failed that investigation."
In a 2018 appearance at the Council on Foreign Relations, Biden bragged about his role in Shokin's removal, saying he had withheld $1 billion in loan guarantees as leverage to force action. But Biden was carrying out a policy developed at the State Department and coordinated with the European Union and the International Monetary Fund.
The Ukrainian prosecutor was regarded as a failure, and "Joe Biden's efforts to oust Shokin were universally praised," said Anders Aslund, a Swedish economist heavily involved in Eastern European market reforms. Getting rid of Shokin was considered the linchpin of reform efforts, but U.S. officials had a list of changes the government needed to make before it could obtain another loan guarantee.
In December 2015, Biden traveled to Kiev and decried the "cancer of corruption" in the country in a speech to the parliament. "The Office of the General Prosecutor desperately needs reform," he noted. Shokin was removed from office three months later, and Biden announced April 15 that the loan guarantee would go forward; the agreement between the United States and Ukraine was signed June 3.
One can certainly raise questions about Hunter Biden's judgment in joining Burisma's board at a time his father had a high-profile role in working with Ukraine's government. But by continuing to claim that Biden "did" something for his son, Trump persists in spreading a false narrative about a diplomatic maneuver hailed at the time as a step toward reducing corruption in Ukraine.

False: Hunter Biden made a killing on a China deal
At various times Trump has claimed Hunter Biden "made millions of dollars from China" or "walks out of China with $1.5 billion in a fund" after hitching a ride with his father on Air Force Two. But there is no evidence to support those statements.
In December 2013, Hunter Biden and one of his daughters flew from Japan to China with Joe Biden on Air Force Two as the vice president embarked on a diplomatic mission.
Twelve days after he flew to Beijing, Hunter Biden joined an advisory board of a fund called BHR Partners, which had announced it would try to raise $1.5 billion. The New Yorker magazine reported that during the trip he arranged for his father to shake hands with Jonathan Li, who ran a Chinese private-equity fund and was one of the partners who had formed BHR.
But while Joe Biden was vice president, Hunter Biden was only on the board of the advisory firm that did not directly invest, but instead advised those who did. George Mesires, a lawyer for Hunter Biden, said he took an equity stake in 2017, after Joe Biden was no longer vice president.
Mesires told The Fact Checker that the investment management company "was capitalized from various sources with a total of 30 million RMB [Chinese renminbi], or about $4.2 million, not $1.5 billion." Because Biden acquired a 10 percent minority interest, his "capital commitment is approximately $420,000," Mesires said.
"To date, Mr. Biden has not received any return or compensation on account of this investment or his position on the board of directors," Mesires said.

False: Biden lied about talking to his son
After the reports on Hunter Biden's business deals emerged, Joe Biden told reporters: "I have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings."
Trump claimed that this was a lie because "he's already said he spoke to his son." But Biden had not. Instead, Trump appeared to be referring to a line in the New Yorker profile: "As Hunter recalled, his father discussed Burisma with him just once: 'Dad said, "I hope you know what you are doing," and I said, "I do." ' "
That's not much of a discussion. In any case, Biden never said he spoke to his son, as Trump claimed he did.

False: Democratic senators also threatened Ukraine's aid
Trump claimed that three Democratic senators - Patrick J. Leahy (Vt.), Richard J. Durbin (Ill.) and Robert Menendez (N.J.) - "implied that their support for U.S. assistance to Ukraine was at stake and that if they didn't do the right thing they wouldn't get any assistance." He later referred to "senators that threatened him with votes and no money coming into Ukraine if they do things."
Trump suggested this was the "real deal," unlike allegations that he held up military aid to force the Ukrainian government to investigate the Bidens.
Trump is referring to a letter written in 2018, and it does not say what he claims.
The letter, written to the special prosecutor at the time, Yuriy Lutsenko, expressed concern about a New York Times report that Ukraine had stopped cooperating with special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election to avoid upsetting Trump. The letter does not threaten a loss of aid, though it notes that the Times article said that the freezing of cooperation was motivated by a worry that Trump would cut off aid. (The article was titled: "Ukraine, Seeking U.S. Missiles, Halted Cooperation with Mueller Investigation.")
The letter noted the signers have supported efforts to build Ukraine's democracy and expressed "disappointment" that some lawmakers in Kiev were trying "to avoid the ire of President Trump." The senators then ask questions, seeking to clarify whether the Times report was correct and whether the Trump administration had encouraged the government not to cooperate with Mueller.
Lutsenko never responded. Since the letter was sent, the three senators have voted for nearly $870 million in additional aid to Ukraine, with Leahy and Durbin (members of the Senate Appropriations Committee) voting in committee on Thursday for an additional $448 million in fiscal 2020, an increase over 2018 and 2019.

Texto completo: It's no secret the NBA has offered questionable height listings for its players in years past. Just look at Kevin Durant.
The 10-time all-star is "officially" 6-foot-9, per NBA.com - but that always has been puzzling. A 2016 photo of him standing next to DeMarcus Cousins and DeAndre Jordan, who both are listed as 6-11, doesn't add up. Durant appears taller than both of them.
"I keep telling him to stop standing by me, man," Cousins said jokingly at the time, according to Sporting News. "I think people are starting to figure out I might be about 6-7. He's every bit of 7 feet - every bit."
Although Durant will be sidelined with an Achilles' injury during his first season with the Brooklyn Nets, we finally will learn this year how tall he and other NBA players truly are. The New York Times reported this past week that the league told teams that they must submit the "precise height and age" for every player.
NBA spokesman Mike Bass confirmed the report to The Washington Post, adding, "A consistent process has been created to ensure the integrity and accuracy of the data on team rosters."
This year, heights will be recorded definitively by measuring players with their shoes off, the Times reported. The rules for weight will be less strict because it changes frequently.
On the opposite side of the spectrum is Dallas Mavericks guard J.J. Barea, who is 6-foot but told the Wall Street Journal he's actually "5-foot-10 on a good day."
Durant's reason for rounding down all these years, he said, was to play his preferred position - and to have a little fun.
"For me, when I'm talking to women, I'm 7 feet. . . . In basketball circles, I'm 6-9," Durant told the Journal. "Really, that's the prototypical size for a small forward. Anything taller than that, and they'll start saying, 'Ah, he's a power forward.' "
Later, he told a Bay Area radio station that he fibs about his height because "I just like messin' with people."

Texto completo: Rudy Giuliani, el abogado personal de Donald Trump, es una de las personas que acabaron en el centro de una gran tormenta política que involucra actualmente al presidente de Estados Unidos. Un viaje que el letrado hizo a España este verano podría representar uno de sus encargos recientes que más dolores de cabeza podría costarle.
El nuevo escándalo que embistió a Trump estalló después de que un informante anónimo denunciara en una queja dirigida al Congreso que el presidente intentó presionar a su homólogo de Ucrania para que este lo ayudara con un plan para investigar a Joe Biden , político demócrata y actualmente destacado rival político. Giuliani, quien fue alcalde de Nueva York entre 1994 y 2001, tuvo un papel clave en esta maniobra política, según el denunciante.
Mientras que la Cámara de Representantes la mayoría demócrata abrió una investigación de juicio político contra el mandatario para averiguar si abusó de su poder, seis abogados que trabajaron con Giuliani en el Departamento de Justicia, donde el actual abogado personal del presidente cubrió distintos cargos, aseguraron a NBC News que creen que el letrado, una de las personas más cercanas a Trump, cometió crímenes en esas circunstancias.
En su viaje de finales de julio a la capital del país ibérico, Giuliani se reunió con un asesor de Volodymyr Zelenskiy, el presidente ucraniano, según el informante. El encuentro se produjo un día después de que Trump llamara a su homólogo para pedirle que investigara a Biden y su hijo Hunter, involucrado en negocios en el país eslavo, por posibles actos de corrupción. Y la misión servía supuestamente para afianzar ese plan.
“Ciertamente, este no es el Giuliani que conozco”, afirmó a NBC Jeffrey Harris, quien trabajó como asistente principal de Giuliani cuando estaba en el Departamento de Justicia durante la administración del presidente Ronald Reagan. “Creo que el Giuliani que conozco pondría bajo juicio al Giuliani de hoy”.
El excompañero del abogado de Trump , que ahora ejerce la profesión privadamente, agregó que el Gobierno de EEUU tiene “todo un aparato” que está configurado para tratar con funcionarios extranjeros. “Y Rudy Giuliani no es uno de ellos”, dijo.
La queja del informante anónimo asegura que el abogado también tuvo otros contactos con oficiales ucranianos. “Si esto se considerara como uso de recursos del Gobierno para beneficio propio, esta conducta estaría asociada a una serie de delitos.”.
NBC contactó en total a siete ex colegas de Giuliani. Uno no contestó, pero todos los demás coincidieron en no defender su conducta. E indicaron una serie de delitos que podría haber cometido, desde la violación de leyes electorales federales hasta el soborno y la extorsión.
Bruce Fein, quien trabajó en el Departamento de Justicia con Giuliani a principios de la década de 1980, dijo que cree que Giuliani podría ser procesado por violar las leyes federales de elecciones si se demuestra que intentó influir en la campaña de las presidenciales de 2020, en las que Biden quiere postularse como adversario a Trump.
“Las leyes electorales federales hacen que sea ilegal solicitar algo de valor de un Gobierno o ciudadanos extranjeros para influir en el resultado de una elección”, sostuvo. Fein dijo que Giuliani también podría exponerse a cargos por soborno ya que Trump supuestamente retuvo fondos militares para presionar a Ucrania. “Si Giuliani estuviera al tanto de eso, podría ser cómplice de Trump al conspirar para solicitar un soborno”, dijo.
Daniel Richman, quien trabajó con Giuliani en la Oficina del Fiscal de los Estados Unidos en Manhattan a fines de la década de 1980, dijo que necesitaba ver más evidencia antes de tomar una determinación concluyente. Pero estuvo de acuerdo en que un esfuerzo por ayudar en un complot para retener fondos de una potencia extranjera a cambio de un favor personal o político podría exponer al abogado de Trump a cargos criminales que podrían ir del fraude a la extorsión.
Otros ex fiscales que trabajaron con Giuliani plantearon la cuestión de que aparentemente influyó en la política exterior estadounidense, lo que podría suponer violación de la antigua Ley Logan, aprobada en 1799, que prohíbe a los ciudadanos privados negociar con un gobierno extranjero en nombre de los EEUU.
GIULIANI NIEGA
Giuliani calificó estas opiniones de “tonterías”. “No saben de qué están hablando. ¿Qué crímenes?”. También dijo que no pudo haber sobornado a nadie porque no ofreció nada de valor a los ucranianos. “¿Son estos tipos abogados o son imbéciles?”, preguntó en referencia a sus excompañeros, antes de negar que haya ejercido algún tipo de influencia en las elecciones.
El exfiscal federal John Flannery, que trabajó con él a mediados de la década de los setenta, dijo que estaba desconcertado por lo que describió como un flagrante abuso de la ley por su parte.
“Se ha puesto en una posición de ayudar e incitar, y tal vez dar comienzo, a un intercambio de favores con un gobierno extranjero para una campaña política estadounidense a instancias del propio candidato”, dijo Flannery. “Ninguno de los dos lo niega, y de hecho lo están profusamente, repetidamente y dolorosamente admitiendo”.
Flannery dijo que el Giuliani de hoy no se parece en nada al hombre con el que trabajó hace unos 40 años. “Es una sombra del que fue el mejor Rudy, y no el gran abogado que pensé que sería”.
La llamada de Trump a su homólogo ucraniano fue descalificada esta semana, y su contenido difundido en un resumen. También se difundió públicamente la queja del denunciante. Fuentes de la Casa Blanca aseguraron a algunos medios (CNN, The New York Times, The Associated Press) que la administración restringió la accesibilidad al contenido de las conversaciones entre Trump y los líderes de Rusia, Vladimir Putin, y la familia real de Arabia Saudí .

FBI reportedly investigating NJ tax breaks

Texto completo: FBI agents in Philadelphia are investigating New Jersey's tax-break policies, which are also the center of a task force created by Gov. Phil Murphy formed earlier this year, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported.
The Inquirer cited multiple anonymous sources but reported that interviews of witnesses started a month ago and focused on development in Camden.
The revelations of federal agents investigating the tax breaks, which were used heavily under former former Gov. Chris Christie, also follow a steady stream of news reports raising questions about how the programs were administered and how companies took advantage of them.
The New York Times reported earlier in the week that a dozen companies had threatened to leave New Jersey for the same building complex in New York if they did not receive tax breaks. But they never did, and many of them never seriously considered moving to the Blue Hill Plaza in Pearl River, New York, located just a half-mile from the New Jersey border in Bergen County.
New Jersey's two major tax credit programs were designed to encourage businesses to create jobs and to invest in the Garden State, and Christie, a Republican, and many Democrats who supported the incentives have defended them as essential tools to compete with neighboring states.
The programs expired in July, but were already at the center of scrutiny before Philadelphia authorities reportedly joined the fray.
The Attorney General's office in New Jersey has also been looking into the incentives, and the state comptroller issued a damning audit of the incentives at the beginning of the year, saying that they lacked proper controls and there was no way for the state to check if jobs were created.
Murphy's task force, led by a small team of white-collar attorneys, found in an initial report that special interests were overly influential on the creation and implementation of the credits, and that the agency doling out the awards didn't have the proper procedures in place to confirm the validity of applications worth millions of dollars in forfeited taxes.
The task force's biggest targets so far have been companies connected to George E. Norcross III, the heavily influential Democrat from South Jersey who worked closely with longtime friend Stephen Sweeney, the Democratic Senate president, and Christie on a range of policies over the years. Of nearly $11 billion in awarded tax breaks, about $1.1 billion in incentives went to those companies, all located in Camden.
One of the organizations connected to Norcross, Cooper University Hospital, has hired the high-profile attorney Abbe Lowell, according to Politico New Jersey.
The hiring of Lowell, who represented U.S. Sen. Bob Menendez in his corruption trial and White House adviser Jared Kushner in the special counsel's investigation of the Donald Trump presidential campaign, could be a sign that Cooper is facing a serious legal challenge.
For his part, Christie, a former federal prosecutor, said he is "not concerned" about the investigations and that they could be a reaction to media coverage and "the circus that's been created at the State House."
At the unveiling of his new political institute at Seton Hall University on Thursday night, he referred to a 2016 investigation of Norcross by the U.S. Attorney's Office in New Jersey that concluded "no further action is warranted."
Christie, whose institute is founded on civility in politics, blasted his Democratic successor, Murphy, for putting such heavy focus on the tax incentives.
"It's political theater by a guy who understands theater and who needs a show to distract from the fact that the major things that he ran on, he simply hasn't accomplished even though he has a Legislature of his own party," Christie said.
As much as $500 million in tax incentives were subject to being suspended by the state or have been voluntarily terminated already, the task force said in its 75-page report, issued in June. But that money has since been released, according to NJ Advance Media.

Moral Imperative to Impeach, or Mistake?

Texto completo: Readers discuss the ethical and political arguments. "Is it possible that Mr. Trump just lives in a different moral universe than the rest of us?" one reader asks.
To the Editor:
Re "Yes, He's Guilty. Impeachment Is a Mistake" (column, Sept. 27):
Like David Brooks, I thought an impeachment proceeding would be a mistake. As the process unfolds, I now realize that was all about calculation but not about our country's needs in this fraught moment in our history.
Mr. Brooks says "this will probably achieve nothing." If achieving nothing means removing the president from office, this is probably right. The impeachment process does, however, help Congress regain its rightful place as an equal branch of government meant to provide checks and balances on an out-of-control and corrupt executive branch. Now that's an achievement.
Mr. Brooks writes that "this process will increase public cynicism." What is more cynical than knowing that the president has recruited a foreign government to influence our election and doing nothing?
"This could embed Trumpism within the G.O.P." That ship has sailed. Who imagined a Republican Party blind to increasing debt before Mr. Trump? Since when do Republicans trample on the rights of states to set their own policies on protecting their air and water?
As Nancy Pelosi said, "He gave us no choice." The whistle-blower is a patriot. The Democrats' only choice was to have his back.

To the Editor:
David Brooks advises that he spoke with "hundreds of people" in the last few days and "only one even mentioned impeachment." I'm not sure whom Mr. Brooks is hanging out with, but they must be from another planet.
James A. Steinberg
Rhinebeck, N.Y.
To the Editor:
Impeach President Trump? That's just what he wants. Impeachment puts him in the narcissistic place that he wants to be: the center of attention. It draws attention away from his failures to make deals on important domestic and foreign policy issues like immigration, affordable health care, international trade and so on. The icing on the cake is that a partisan Republican Senate will not convict.
Donald Trump doesn't want to be impeached the same way that Br'er Rabbit didn't want to be thrown in the briar patch.
Gary F. Marton
Brooklyn
To the Editor:
Could it be the case that President Trump really does not understand that he did anything wrong in his conversation with the president of Ukraine? This may be just the way he's always done business, by threatening, bullying and demanding something of value in exchange for doing what he is already obligated to do. Is it possible that Mr. Trump just lives in a different moral universe than the rest of us?
Lawrence Weisman
Westport, Conn.
To the Editor:
In my fantasy board game "Impeach Trump Now!" I envision a deck of "outrage" cards from which players would draw. The cards would have various point values and would say things like "Use of the presidency for personal enrichment," "Chronic flagrant lying to the American public" and "Secret extortion of a foreign leader for political gain."
Which card would have the highest point value? My personal pick would be "Forced separation of children from their parents with no plan for their reunification."

Trump told Russians that interference not a concern

Texto completo: President Trump told two senior Russian officials in a 2017 Oval Office meeting that he was unconcerned about Moscow's interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election because the United States did the same in other countries, an assertion that prompted alarmed White House officials to limit access to the remarks to an unusually small number of people, according to three former officials with knowledge of the matter.
The comments, which have not been previously reported, were part of a now-infamous meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, in which Trump revealed highly classified information that exposed a source of intelligence on the Islamic State. He also said during the meeting that firing FBI Director James B. Comey the previous day had relieved "great pressure" on him.
A memorandum summarizing the meeting was limited to all but a few officials with the highest security clearances in an attempt to keep the president's comments from being disclosed publicly, according to the former officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.
The White House's classification of records about Trump's communications with foreign officials is now a central part of the impeachment inquiry launched this week by House Democrats. An intelligence community whistleblower has alleged that the White House placed a record of Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukraine's president, in which he offered U.S. assistance investigating his political opponents, into a code-word classified system reserved for the most sensitive intelligence information.
The White House did not provide a comment Friday.
It is not clear whether a memo documenting the May 10, 2017, meeting with Lavrov and Kislyak was placed into that system, but the three former officials said it was restricted to a very small number of people. The White House had recently begun limiting the records of Trump's calls after remarks he made to the leaders of Mexico and Australia appeared in news reports. The Lavrov memo was restricted to an even smaller group, the former officials said.
A fourth former official, who did not recall the president's remarks to the Russian officials, said memos were restricted only to people who needed to know their contents.
"It was more about learning how can we restrict this in a way that still informs the policy process and the principals who need to engage with these heads of state," the fourth former official said.
But the three former officials with knowledge of the remarks said some memos of the president's communications were kept from people who might ordinarily have access to them. The Lavrov memo fit that description, they said.
White House officials were particularly distressed by Trump's election remarks because it appeared the president was forgiving Russia for an attack that had been designed to help elect him, the three former officials said. Trump also seemed to invite Russia to interfere in other countries' elections, they said.
The previous day, Trump had fired Comey amid the FBI's investigation into whether the Trump campaign had coordinated with Russia. White House aides worried about the political ramifications if Trump's comments to the Russian officials became public.
Trump had publicly ridiculed the Russia investigation as politically motivated and said he doubted Moscow had intervened in the election. By the time he met with Lavrov and Kislyak, Trump had been briefed by the most senior U.S. intelligence officials about the Russian operation, which was directed by Russian President Vladimir Putin and included the theft and publication of Democratic emails and the seeding of propaganda in social media, according to the findings of the U.S. intelligence community.
Trump's firing of Comey touched off an investigation into whether the president had tried to obstruct the FBI's probe. His comments about Comey's dismissal being a relief, which were first reported the same month by the New York Times, reinforced suspicions that Trump dismissed Comey because the FBI was investigating him.
According to the fourth former official, Trump lamented to Lavrov that "all this Russia stuff" was detrimental to good relations. Trump also complained, "I could have a great relationship with you guys, but you know, our press," this former official said, characterizing the president's remarks.
H.R. McMaster, the president's then-national security adviser, repeatedly told Trump he could not trust the Russians, according to two former officials.
On some areas, Trump conveyed U.S. policy in a constructive way, such as telling the Russians that their aggression in Ukraine was not good, one of those former officials said.
"What was difficult to understand was how they got a free pass on a lot of things - election security and so forth," this former official said. "He was just very accommodating to them."
The former official observed that Trump has "that streak of moral equivalency," recalling how he once dismissed a question about the assassination of journalists and dissidents in Putin's Russia by telling Fox News's Bill O'Reilly: "There are a lot of killers. You think our country's so innocent?"
Another former official said Trump wasn't the only one to conflate Russia's interference in the U.S. elections with U.S. efforts to promote democracy and good governance abroad.
The president and his top aides seemed not to understand the difference between Voice of America, a U.S.-supported news organization that airs in foreign countries, with Russian efforts to persuade American voters by surreptitiously planting ads in social media, this person said.
One former senior official said Trump regularly defended Russia's actions, even in private, saying no country is pure. "He was always defensive of Russia," this person said, adding the president had never made such a specific remark about interference in their presence.
"He thought the whole interference thing was ridiculous. He never bought into it."

Texto completo: In Vietnam, citizens were enlisted to post pro-government messages on their personal Facebook pages. The Guatemalan government used hacked and stolen social media accounts to silence dissenting opinions. Ethiopia's ruling party hired people to influence social media conversations in its favor.
Despite increased efforts by internet platforms like Facebook to combat internet disinformation, the use of the techniques by governments around the world is growing, according to a report released Thursday by researchers at Oxford University. Governments are spreading disinformation to discredit political opponents, bury opposing views and interfere in foreign affairs.
The researchers compiled information from news organizations, civil society groups and governments to create one of the most comprehensive inventories of disinformation practices by governments around the world. They found that the number of countries with political disinformation campaigns more than doubled to 70 in the last two years, with evidence of at least one political party or government entity in each of those countries engaging in social media manipulation.
In addition, Facebook remains the No. 1 social network for disinformation, the report said. Organized propaganda campaigns were found on the platform in 56 countries.
"Social media technology tends to empower propaganda and disinformation in really new ways," said Samantha Bradshaw, a researcher at the Oxford Internet Institute, a department at Oxford University, and co-author of the study. The institute previously worked with the Senate Intelligence Committee to investigate Russian interference around the 2016 campaign.
The report highlights the continuing challenge for Facebook, Twitter and YouTube as they try to combat disinformation, particularly when the perpetrators are governments. The companies have announced internal changes to reduce social media manipulation and foreign interference.
But the research shows that use of the tactics, which include bots, fake social media accounts and hired "trolls," is growing. In the past two months, the platforms have suspended accounts linked to governments in China and Saudi Arabia.
Ben Nimmo, director of investigations at Graphika, a company that specializes in analyzing social media, said the growing use of internet disinformation is concerning for the 2020 U.S. election. A mix of domestic and foreign groups, operating autonomously or with loose ties to a government, are building from the methods used by Russia in the last presidential election, making it difficult for the platforms to police, he said.
"The danger is the proliferation" of the techniques, he said. "Anybody who wants to influence the 2020 election may be tempted to copy what the Russian operation did in 2016."
China's emergence as a powerful force in global disinformation is one of the most significant developments of the past year, researchers said. The country has long used propaganda domestically, but the protests this year in Hong Kong brought evidence that it was expanding its efforts.

Mary Wilson unveils Supreme style

Texto completo: Sean Spicer, the former White House press secretary, is not the only contestant on the new season of "Dancing With the Stars" with a special kind of celebrity wattage.
Mary Wilson, a founding member of the Supremes, is also a competitor - at age 75. Viewers should get ready for liberal lashings of old-school dazzle and a sense of d�j� vu. There is barely a Black female pop act - Destiny's Child, Janet Jackson, Janelle Mon�e, Solange Knowles - (let alone a white one) that hasn't taken a page from the Supremes look book.
"Millennials love our style," Wilson said during a recent interview in London. For anyone wondering why this younger generation has joined older fans of the group's look, a new book, "Supreme Glamour," out just in time for the show, makes it all clear.
The volume chronicles how the Supremes in their original incarnation (Diana Ross, Wilson and Florence Ballard) and in their later form as Diana Ross and the Supremes (or DRATS) became agents of cultural change in the 1960s, breaking the race ceiling by weaponizing fashion and defining the way many women - Black women, white women - wanted to look. It has photographs of mannequins in 13 of their designs, plus dozens of concert snaps, promotional portraits and album and magazine covers. It is replete with seed pearls and mushroom pleats.
Before the Supremes, as Harold Kramer, the former curatorial director of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, notes in the book, no Black act "had ever set out to utilize visual signifiers that made them palatable to a white audience."
Wilson agreed. "Our glamour changed things," she said. She was wearing all black - leggings and a stretch top with cold-shoulder cutouts - and one of her many wigs, a dead-straight chestnut number with full bangs. "We were role models," she continued. "What we wore mattered."
Her claim is that she and her partners knew exactly what they were doing from the beginning.
Wilson said that when she, Ross and Ballard were signed to Motown Records in 1961, they already had style. "They had a lot to work with," she said. "As Maxime Powell, who ran the label's famous finishing school, used to say: 'You girls are diamonds in the rough. We are just here to polish you.'"
Wilson remembered that one of the earliest Supremes dresses, with a fitted bodice and stiff balloon skirt, "Diana and I sewed from Butterick patterns."
When the Supremes broke in 1964, Black singers like Lena Horne and Eartha Kitt performed in deliberately seductive evening dresses, but they were older, solo artists. Wilson and her colleagues were barely out of their teens and wielded the visual power of three, often in grown-up second-skin gowns freighted with beads and sequins.
DRATS maximized the look with increasingly baroque confections, some with improbable wings and trompe I'oeil jewelry, like paste crystals sewn into the neckline. Anyone who saw them live will recall the frisson produced by such young women in such sophisticated designs. Then, just when you thought you had them figured out, they turned up on "The Ed Sullivan Show" in 1969 in fantastical, swishing ponchos and pants seemingly made of d�grad� tinsel.
For Whoopi Goldberg, writing in the foreword of Wilson's book, the Supremes "were three of the most beautiful women I had ever seen. These were brown women as they had never, ever been seen before on national television."
Goldberg said she was encouraged to think that "I too could be well-spoken, tall, majestic, an emissary of Black folks" who, like the Supremes, "came from the projects."
Oprah Winfrey had similar memories, as recounted in "Diana Ross: A Biography" by J. Randy Taraborrelli. "You never saw anything like it in the 1960s - three women of color who were totally empowered, creative, imaginative," she is quoted as saying. As a 10-year-old black girl "to see the Supremes and know that it was possible to be like them, that black people could do THAT..."
Many of the dresses in the book are owned by Wilson, although others are held by the Motown Museum in Detroit. Wilson wants them back. She said she has "proof that the clothes were debited from the Supremes account at Motown," meaning that she and her cohorts paid for them.
It is apparent in the book that 1967 was the turning point for the Supremes - the year everything changed. The wigs became bigger (and more expensive), the false eyelashes longer, the chandelier earrings heavier. Ballard was replaced by Cindy Birdsong (cue "Dreamgirls"), and Ross now had top billing.
Indeed, Wilson might have read Ross' ascension in the seams (or accessories): In the first Supremes publicity still, Ballard and Wilson wear two rows of pop pearls, Ross three.
The personnel shake-up and change from the Supremes to Diana Ross and the Supremes triggered something of a steroidal makeover, with high-end off-the-rack styles and gowns designed expressly for the women, although some of them were slow to retire their bullet bras. Wilson recalled that there came a point when what they wore was nearly as important as their music.
"We were so in demand - we needed an endless supply of great high fashion," she said. "Stores would stay open late just for us so we could shop privately."
Featured in "Supreme Glamour" are the salmon halter-neck gowns Bob Mackie created for "On Broadway," the 1969 television special with the Temptations. Dyed-to-match turkey feathers circle the hems, and broken lines of silver sequins march up the front and back of the dresses in an inverted "V." Because they were bias-cut, as Mackie explained in an interview, "they open like a Chinese puzzle and cup at the knee, holding you in."
"Diana Ross and the Supremes are legendary, when you think of how they've been knocked off and imitated," he added. "They were the best pros I've ever seen because they did nothing but work and learn."
One group of dresses probably says more than any other about the queens of Motown and their relationship to fashion and power: the pink caftans with rainbow wings they modeled on the cover of their 1968 recording of the "Funny Girl" score.
They were created by James Galanos, otherwise known as the favored designer of the clothes-horse wife of the then governor of California, Nancy Reagan.

Texto completo: CHAKARAN, Afghanistan -- In one of the most remote places in Afghanistan, government forces this month managed to achieve something vanishingly rare these days: They clawed back not one but three districts from the Taliban's grip.
But the cost was high, and the victory was tenuous. Even as the Afghan forces turned their attention toward defending their gains against fierce Taliban counterattacks in Badakhshan Province, paramilitary fighters were swamped by grief: One of their most revered commanders, Najmullah, was among the dead.
His men washed and wrapped his body carefully in white cloth, then loaded it onto a police pickup. They followed behind with heads bowed, weapons strapped across their backs and the morning sun glinting off their ammunition bandoleers.
A visit by New York Times journalists to Badakhshan, a far-northern spit of Afghanistan sandwiched by Tajikistan, China and Pakistan, showed the desperate nature of a fight in a place cut off from the rest of the country for months every year by winter storms and rugged terrain.
Even the insurgency looks different here: Al Qaeda and Islamic State loyalists are mashed together with the Taliban in fighting the Afghan government, officials say, in a tenacious insurgent force bolstered by a few hundred foreign fighters from Pakistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, China and Turkmenistan.
Badakhshan's natural resources and strategic location fuels and finances much of the fighting. Its hillsides are carved by lapis lazuli and gold mines, and its road networks are vital drug trafficking routes that link the trade in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Tajikistan.
The government operation to regain the three districts here, with the heaviest fighting falling on Sept. 7, cleared sections of an important roadway leading to Tajikistan and drove insurgents into a retreat to the mountains.
The offensive cobbled together every resource the besieged military could muster -- the local police, the national police, the Afghan Army, the national intelligence service and most importantly, United States warplanes. Airstrikes destroyed Taliban heavy weapon emplacements dug into the mountains, local commanders said, turning the tide of battle.
"Our men fought hard, but without air support from the Americans we could not have taken this district," said Habibullah Rahman Sharifi, a local commander.
The government intelligence commander in Badakhshan, Brig. Gen. Mohammad Hanif Nuristani, said the government hoped to push forward and take more districts. When asked whether that would be possible without more American airstrikes, the general pursed his lips and shook his head no -- a particularly sobering assessment given that the Afghan security forces all know of American efforts to negotiate a final troop withdrawal.
A few days after the government's initial victory, the Taliban counterattacked from three surrounding mountains, sending mortar rounds and rockets crashing down on the government fighters holding the center of Wardoj District, in an eight-hour battle.
Commander Najmullah went down, and four paramilitary police officers also were killed. They, too, were later taken to a cemetery in police trucks, shrouded in green cloth as martyrs of war.
Several soldiers and police officers in Wardoj said the Taliban nearly succeeded in retaking the district. The insurgents had maneuvered so close to government positions that airstrikes were too risky -- the military term is "danger close."
The morning after the battle, an Afghan Army unit was dug in along the rutted dirt roadway just east of the village. Soldiers said at least 50 rocket-propelled grenades had slammed into their positions the night before, killing one soldier and wounding two others.
This was the front line. The morning silence was shattered by the whump-whump of Taliban heavy machine gun fire from the mountains above.
The deputy commander, Lt. Col. Khizer Mohammad Darwazi, leisurely sought cover behind a Humvee. He pointed to the rocky gray mountains surrounding his men's positions.
"The enemy is right there -- they're watching us," he said. "They are bringing every weapon they have against us because this area is strategic for them."
First Lt. Zia Ahmad said the Taliban had strong support from local residents. On the other hand, he said, his troops have rising morale and momentum -- and the security of American airstrikes.
"The Taliban run when they hear the aircraft," the lieutenant said.
But the district center in Chakaran is held by just 250 to 300 local and national police officers, commanders said. They said they do not have enough men to drive the Taliban off the mountains and then hold those positions.
The district governor, Mohammad Emran Payam, stood in the shade of an apple orchard at the district center as the funeral possession passed by. He complained that the central government had not provided enough men and matériel to hold the district, much less push forward to take other districts.
The government had not even provided him with a vehicle, he said. He paid for a rented car.
"We need more help," Mr. Payam said. "The Taliban are willing to die to take this district back -- it's crucial for their strategy."
The Taliban seized the district from the government four years ago, driving out security forces and their families. "This is the first time I've seen my house in four years," said one police officer, Zahidullah, who goes by one name.
Displaced residents are still afraid to return, wary that the Taliban will crush the police contingent. At least 2,400 families had been displaced, living the past four years in camps and rented homes, said Abdullah Najdi, head of a council of displaced people who was displaced himself.
Mr. Najdi said foreign fighters looted homes and stole crops and livestock. In the village of Bashund in Wardoj District, 120 foreign fighters still lived in houses they had commandeered four years ago.
"Everyone is still afraid to come back," Mr. Najdi said. "The future of this district is not clear to us at all."
After the battle, Mir Ahmad, 38, cautiously reopened his tiny restaurant in Chakaran, inside a dusty shanty on the dirt roadway that bisects the village. For four years, foreign fighters who did not speak the local Persian language dined there.
"And they paid me -- I had no problem with them," Mr. Ahmad said.
Nor did he have a problem with the government troops he hoped would now patronize his little establishment. But he said he had no idea how long they might be able to hold the village and district.
Abdullah Naji Nazari, a member of the provincial council, said the fight to retake the province was personal for him. The village of his birth was still under Taliban control.
Mr. Nazari said he worried that Badakhshan could become an international terrorism stronghold with the presence of Al Qaeda and the Islamic State. He said the Taliban had clashed with the foreign jihadists, but had since aligned with them to fight a government they consider an American puppet.
"This isn't just an Afghan problem," Mr. Nazari said. "It's an international problem."
General Nuristani, the intelligence commander in Badakhshan, said that at least 400 foreign fighters had joined the Taliban, Al Qaeda and the Islamic State in the province. He said his men captured four black Islamic State flags during the fighting in Wardoj District.
Mr. Nazari said the government had retaken areas containing a massive lapis lazuli mine that the Taliban had taxed. But he said local warlords and power brokers were now fighting over the mine, with no government plan to control and tax the prized blue gemstone.
"Everybody wants a piece of the mines," he said of the 30 lapis lazuli, gold and other mines in the province.
Even with the collapse this month of a proposed peace deal between the United States and the Taliban for a phased American troop withdrawal, Mr. Nazari said he was concerned that President Trump might precipitously pull the troops out anyway.
"This whole operation would not have been possible without American airpower," he said. "We couldn't succeed without it."
In Chakaran, a man with a pickax tore at the hard clay earth of the local cemetery to carve out a narrow grave for their fallen commander, Najmullah. Among the many mourners were police officers, still bearing their weapons. They braced for another possible Taliban counterattack.
The mourners held out their hands, palms up, and prayed. The body was lowered gently into the earth, with four more to follow.

Texto completo: General Motors said Thursday that it would continue health care coverage for striking workers, reversing an earlier decision, as the company and the United Auto Workers union negotiated a new labor contract.
The company said last week that it would cease payments providing coverage at the end of September, prompting the union to scramble to arrange temporary health insurance for the 49,000 factory and other workers who walked off the job on Sept. 16.
G.M. said it realized the pending switch was causing confusion for workers and health care providers. "Given that confusion, G.M. has chosen to work with our providers to keep all benefits fully in place for striking hourly employees, so they have no disruption to their medical care, including vision, prescription and dental coverage," a spokesman said in an email.
In a letter to G.M. on Thursday, Terry Dittes, the union vice president leading the negotiations, complained that the automaker was "toying" with the lives of union members with the back and forth on health coverage. "There is no doubt that public sentiment sees these actions of G.M. as a shameful act!" Mr. Dittes wrote.
In the contract talks, the union is pushing G.M. to increase pay for temporary and less-senior workers, reopen plants it has idled and allot more future production to factories in the United States instead of those it operates in Mexico. G.M. would like to limit wage increases and cut health care costs. It has closed or idled three plants in the United States to bring its production capacity in line with slowing sales across the nation and elsewhere.
The two sides have come to basic agreements on topics that had been discussed by committees of G.M. and U.A.W. negotiators, Mr. Dittes said in a letter to workers on Wednesday. The talks were shifting to what is known as the "main table," where negotiators face off in a single room.
"All unsettled proposals are now at the main table and have been presented to General Motors, and we are awaiting their response," he wrote. "This back and forth will continue until negotiations are complete."
People close to the talks said that while they were making progress, it might take at least a few days to reach agreement on the remaining issues.

Workers continued to picket at G.M.'s 34 factories and other locations in the United States. Striking workers qualify for weekly payments of $ 250 by the U.A.W., a quarter or less of what most typically take home.
Once a tentative agreement is reached, union leaders must vote to end the strike before workers can return to the assembly lines. Workers would then vote on ratifying the contract.
After the union reaches an agreement with G.M., it will turn to talks with Ford and Fiat Chrysler. Union members at those two companies have been reporting to work without a new contract while senior U.A.W. officials focus on G.M.
The talks are taking place amid a federal investigation into corruption involving the use of union funds for lavish personal travel and spending. So far, 11 people have been charged, including three Fiat Chrysler officials. Homes owned by the current U.A.W. president, Gary Jones, and his predecessor, Dennis Williams, were raided last month, although neither man has been charged.

Texto completo: Headnote HOUSE CALLS
Definition: Daze-A state of being confused, befuddled, overcome. Stunned, stupefied, dumb
School bells are ringing and children will be doing more than singing. They will be acting up, hyperactive, impulsive, irritable, distracted and anti-social Urey will have difficulty with concentration and memory and exhibit many other anti-learning characteristics. In other words, they will be in a daze, and their brains will not be up to par. This deficiency results from having a good time while eating the wrong kinds of sugarladen foods and drinks over the summer.
Why are so many children in this day and time in a dazed state? I am convinced that it is not due to one-parent homes or poverty, poor housing or any other negative social condition. It is due to poor nutrition, just remember, the brain is like a computer, if you put junk in, you'll get junk out
A smart and responsive brain needs a nutritious breakfast that will supply adequate vitamins and minerals. Cupcakes, potato chips, pork-rinds popcorn and sugar-laden drinks do not constitute fuel for the brain. If you read the labels of these food items the brain is being exposed to preservatives, artificial colors and other chemicals that will cause hyperactivity and malnourishmenL
A few years ago, Jane Brody, the scientific writer for The New York Times, related that when a normally well-behaved youngster in her family ate chocolate, she became wild and aggressive. Just recently, Jane Hersey, the national director of the Feingold Assocation of the United States related to me that when a youngster who played football was exposed to an artificial red dye, he became so aggressive that no one on the opposing team could stop him from winning due to the fact that he was so hyperactive. It is interesting that the Olympic Committee checks athletes for injectable stimulants but does not take into consideration the diets of Olympians I am sure many of them use certain nutrients and chemicals found in foods that increase their aggressiveness and ability to perform, thus winning many medals.
It has been shown and demonstrated that companies who produce certain foods and snacks add more salt and sugar to their products to stimulate the taste buds. Fast foods are giving us a fast track to hyperactivity and poor nutrition.
For years, FAUS has uplifted tire research of Dr. Benjamin Feingold, who demonstrated without a doubt that diet causes hyperactivity resulting in diminished brain function, leading to poor performance in school. Furthermore, many prisons are filled with youngsters who have committed crimes due to abnormal brain function related to diet Let me tell you, prison food only helps to continue this bad behavior. It was also reported that when sugar was removed from tite prison diet behavior improved. 1 would strongly suggest that you read the book, "Sugar Blues" by William Dufty.
If you are interested in keeping your children out of a daze, I suggest that you get in touch with Jane Hersey, national director of the Feingold Association of the United States, whose motto is "Nutrition Ls a Better Why, A dietary connection to better behavior, leamingand health" She is also the author of 'Why Can't My Child Behave." For more information call the Feingold Association at 1-800321-3287 or website, feingold.org.
I am sure that this program will keep your children out of that daze and you will feel proud of their achievements on graduation day.

Texto completo: After their sixth consecutive season out of the playoffs, expect the Lakers to begin training camp this weekend by talking about fresh starts and clean slates. The upcoming season might be new, but it’s not fresh or clean – the Lakers are still trying to learn from the last one.
Take Tuesday night’s appearance of LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Kyle Kuzma, Dwight Howard, Quinn Cook and Talen-Horton Tucker at a WNBA playoff game in Las Vegas. There’s subtext: The players were among the Lakers invited to Vegas by James, who is trying to do more to create team chemistry this year after the franchise strained at the seams while stumbling to a 37-45 record in his first season in L.A.
It’s a new group with the same measuring stick: A veteran-laden roster that is expected to be more competitive than last season and perhaps even bring the Lakers back to their longtime place as a title contender.
With Lakers media day scheduled for Friday morning in El Segundo, here are the top stories to follow between now and the Oct. 22 regular-season opener against the Clippers:
1. What is the balance of power between Anthony Davis and LeBron James?
James has so far insisted that Davis will be the focal point, something Davis reiterated to Yahoo Sports in an interview earlier this month: “To have a guy like LeBron, someone of his caliber, go tell management and ownership and the coaches that he wants me to be the focal point is an honor. I know what comes with that, and that’s a lot of heavy lifting. I want to be able to do that.”
Davis has been the focal point of every team he’s ever played for, but he’s yet to win big in the postseason. James has also been the focal point of every team he’s ever played for, and while signs of physical decline might be more evident in his 17th NBA season, the four-time league MVP is still going to be the one running most of the team’s plays.
There’s a natural fit to Davis’ and James’ games, particularly as pick-and-roll threats. That partnership also extends off the court, where the two men have appeared together at a variety of offseason events and share the same agent (and are slotted for starring roles in a “Space Jam” movie). But when push comes to shove, who takes the last shot? Who takes the lead in dictating habits in practice and the locker room?
There’s the matter of Davis’ leverage: He’s got just one year left on his deal, and his agent Rich Paul has promised that he will enter free agency next summer (even though the Lakers are the presumptive favorite to re-sign him). That will weigh on the minds of the team’s lead decision-makers, who must find ways to make Davis feel comfortable within the franchise. But it’s also up to James, as a co-star, to make sure the relationship remains as close as it’s appeared so far.
2. What is Frank Vogel’s stamp on the team?
The month-long process that finally led the Lakers to two-time NBA head coach Frank Vogel was a tortured one. His own introduction was overshadowed by the specter of Magic Johnson. But the 46-year-old New Jersey native has handled the awkward circumstances of his hiring as well as anyone could, outlining a bright vision for the coming season. He’s also no stranger to competing at a high level, as his best Indiana Pacers teams can attest.
The circumstances around Vogel, however, would be tricky for any coach to thread. From the politics of having two superstars, to working with an assembly of coaches who some observers have colored as possible successors, he’ll have plenty of challenges coming to L.A.
Vogel’s calling card in the past has been rugged and accountable defenses that have done just enough on offense. He’s said he’s eager to show how he’s evolved since a truncated stint in Orlando and a year-long sabbatical from coaching. But time is of the essence for Vogel to show how he can assert himself in a position that’s experienced a lot of recent turnover.
3. Who is the starting point guard?
Anyone who has watched James in the past two decades understands he will assume most of the playmaking duties. The question is who is the additional guard who starts alongside Danny Green.
There are several candidates on roughly the same footing: Rajon Rondo, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Avery Bradley, Quinn Cook and Alex Caruso. There have been few signs so far of how the Lakers plan to divine a starting guard from the mix, particularly given that there are so many different strengths on the table without a clear-cut, No. 1 option on the depth chart.
There’s a good chance that the early part of the season will see a fair amount of juggling between those options to see how they fit alongside Davis, James and everyone else.
4. What does Dwight Howard bring to the table?
No one ever argued Dwight Howard can’t make a good first impression. In a preseason conference call with reporters, the eight-time All-Star’s words rang of humility.
“My goal is just to win, there’s nothing else that matters,” he said. “Whatever I have to do to be a great teammate, whatever I have to do on the court, it’s all about winning.”
The problem is Howard is well-versed in finding the right opening lines, but he hasn’t found a way to follow through on them. Including his previous Lakers tenure, he’s been an ill fit with nearly every roster he’s been a part of, despite repeated preseason oaths that he’s changed.
The compelling part of Howard is his talent. In Charlotte for his last healthy season, he averaged 16.6 points and 12.5 rebounds. The Lakers could benefit from solid and steady production in the post, as long as Howard is ready to get with the program.
There’s no problem for the team if it goes south: Howard’s reported contract details have him on a short leash. But if the Lakers can squeeze value from him, that could add a good deal of upside to their potential.
5. Can the Lakers finally get some luck with player health?
Even the summer is not kind. DeMarcus Cousins tore his ACL in August and is likely out for the year. The New York Times reported Tuesday that Kyle Kuzma, another key component for the team, might miss part of training camp with the left foot injury that kept him out of the FIBA World Cup for Team USA.
The Lakers are already walking a perilously thin rope, even before you consider that James, 34, is coming off a season when he played the fewest games of his career, and the offseason roster moves have resulted in a significantly older squad. The practice of load management is currently en vogue after Kawhi Leonard sat out nearly a quarter of the regular season then led Toronto to the 2019 NBA title, so it’s certainly possible the Lakers could look to lessen the regular-season burden on their stars.
That could help down the road, but they have to get to the postseason first. The Lakers have to win enough games in a deep Western Conference to earn a playoff spot. Having to play any significant length of time without any of their stars could prove damning to that effort. Even though the Lakers have added a second superstar, that also means losing one of their best players would create a void that is even more difficult to replace.

The New York Times reported Tuesday that Kyle Kuzma, another key component for the team, might miss part of training camp with the left foot injury that kept him out of the FIBA World Cup for Team USA.
The Lakers are already walking a perilously thin rope, even before you consider that James, 34, is coming off a season when he played the fewest games of his career, and the offseason roster moves have resulted in a significantly older squad. The practice of load management is currently en vogue after Kawhi Leonard sat out nearly a quarter of the regular season then led Toronto to the 2019 NBA title, so it’s certainly possible the Lakers could look to lessen the regular-season burden on their stars.
That could help down the road, but they have to get to the postseason first. The Lakers have to win enough games in a deep Western Conference to earn a playoff spot. Having to play any significant length of time without any of their stars could prove damning to that effort. Even though the Lakers have added a second superstar, that also means losing one of their best players would create a void that is even more difficult to replace.

Texto completo: Re “Hospital unfazed by bond rating” (News, Sept. 22):
Your article regarding the removal of the CEO of San Antonio Hospital ranks right up there with the recent New York Times report that tried to smear Justice Kavanaugh. It omitted the pertinent information and details of the true financial situation.
The commitment to build the Vineyard Towers addition was already underway when the hospital hired Harris Koenig. In addition, the choice of the contractor (who failed to complete the project up to code) had also been selected.
Because of poor workmanship, the hospital was required to hire a new contractor to repair and replace the unsatisfactory work in order for the new facility to pass inspection and open to the public.
There seems to be a lot more to this story than was published.
— Nancy Ruddock, Alta Loma
More accepting society
Re “Drag queens debate spotlights creepy trend on right” (Opinion, Sept. 13):
Steven Greenhut makes excellent points on the debate on drag queens. In our society, we push down being so different and going against our “norms.”
But as a senior in high school and as the future generation, I applaud those queens for standing up against society and showing them who they are.
Those children are being exposed to this expression, and showing them we can be whoever we choose to be. And hopefully by the time they grow up, our society will be more accepting. People must accept that we are living in an ever-expanding world and society.
— Victoria Neal, Redlands
No taking weapons home
Re “National Guard and guns” (Letters, Sept. 22):
I was in the National Guard for six and a half years. I spent six months on active duty. During that time, I trained with the regular army.
During all the time I spent on active duty and in reserve we were not allowed to take our weapons home. The weapons were locked in the supply room at the armory. The only time we were allowed to use our weapons with ammunition was once a year on the firing range.
I’ve never heard of one soldier killing another soldier during my time on active duty. If we do not trust our military to carry guns, and there have been no deaths, why do we allow untrained personnel to carry guns and ammunition?

Thomas L. Friedman: It’s the environment, stupid

Texto completo: I don’t know who sold progressive Democrats on the idea that the way to beat Donald Trump is to abolish the private health insurance of 160 million Americans and offer instead “Medicare for All” (and Mexico will pay for it), but it’s a political loser and an easy target for Trump to feast on. A much better campaign theme is hiding in plain sight. I call it “the Earth Race.”
In the 1960s, John F. Kennedy energized the country behind a “space race”: to make America the first nation to put a man on the moon. Democrats need to run against Trump on the Earth Race: to make America the leader in all policies and technologies that help men and women everywhere live sustainably here on Earth.
Yes, I know, mitigating climate change and saving the environment never poll well. But times change, and it depends how you frame the issue. Mother Nature is forcing herself onto the ballot, and Trump’s efforts to roll back more than 80 rules and standards protecting clean air, water, climate, parks and wilderness make him uniquely vulnerable. He can’t pivot away from what he’s doing. He owns it, and it’s villainous. This time is different.
In this era when so much activism is online, when was the last time you saw a bottom-up, mass movement of young people in America and across the world — some 4 million in all — take to the streets on every continent as they did last week to demand action to stop the heating of our planet? These young people are telling us, and their voting parents, that this issue is a political winner — theirs is a movement in search of courageous political leaders.
I am not saying that the Earth Race is the only issue to run on. I’m all for strengthening Obamacare and even adding a public health insurance option. But if I were running for president against Trump, I’d be leading with the Earth Race as an economic opportunity, a national security necessity, a health emergency, an environmental urgency and a moral obligation. No other issue can combine those five.
I’d pound Trump every day with this message: “Trump says he cares about you. Well, that’s funny, because he clearly doesn’t care about the water you drink. He just revoked a rule that prohibited coal mining debris from being dumped into local streams — among other actions to weaken the Clean Water Act — so that pro-Trump coal companies can make more money while they make you sick. What kind of president does that?
“Trump says he cares about you. Well, that’s funny, because he clearly doesn’t care about the air you breathe. He’s weakening clean air rules so that power and coal companies can emit more pollutants, methane and carbon dioxide into the air — so they can make more money and give your kids more childhood asthma today and disruptive climate change tomorrow. What kind of father does that?
“Trump says he cares about making America great again. Well, that’s funny, because he clearly doesn’t care about American automakers and their supply chains. He’s trying to force California and other states to weaken their gas mileage and pollution standards so our companies — which don’t even want this change — can make gas guzzlers and no longer produce cars that get mileage as good as those in Japan or emit as little pollution as China’s expanding electric car fleets. Who the hell does that?
“The last time our auto industry indulged in a race to the bottom on mileage and pollution standards, it went bankrupt. That’s why automakers are resisting Trump’s effort to dumb them down. There are 42 Chinese companies actively manufacturing and selling electric cars in China right now — and they can’t wait to ship them here once Trump forces our manufacturers to make more polluting gas guzzlers.
"All 18,000 public buses in Shenzhen, China, a city of 12 million people, went electric by the end of 2017. ‘Taxis soon followed suit,’ TechCrunch reported in January. In Shenzhen today, 99% of the more than 21,000 cabs run on electric batteries. How does America become great again if we’re surrendering the world’s next great industry — clean power generation and transportation — to China?
“Trump says he’s pro-business. Well, that’s funny, because he’s trying to expand the use of polluting coal when both wind and solar are now cheaper in many locations, including red states. Even Texas is enjoying the cost, environmental and job-creating advantages of wind over coal, producing almost twice as much wind energy as California.
“The Los Angeles Times reported last week: ‘The cost of wind power has fallen about 50% since 2010. Solar has dropped 85%. That makes them cheaper than new coal and gas plants in two-thirds of the world, according to research organization BloombergNEF.’
“Trump says he wants to make America energy independent. Well, that’s funny, because he just rolled back the lighting standards initiated by President George W. Bush and his assistant secretary of energy Andy Karsner to phase out energy-sucking, heat-emitting incandescent and halogen bulbs and replace them with energy-efficient LEDs.
“Andrew deLaski, executive director of the Appliance Standards Awareness Project, told NPR: ‘The rollback will eliminate energy-efficient standards for light bulbs that were slated to take effect in January that would save consumers billions of dollars and reduce millions of tons of climate change carbon dioxide emissions.’ Who does that?”
How do you run against all these things Trump’s doing? With a simple message repeated over and over: “Trump is poisoning Americans and weakening America. Join the Earth Race. Make America healthier, wealthier, smarter and more secure.”
And with a simple solution, too. The Earth Race doesn’t need a giant Green New Deal that tries to change everything at once, as noble as that goal is. It just needs to aggressively amplify what is already happening.
Today, 24 states — including blue California and purple New Mexico — have put in place, to varying degrees, steadily rising standards for clean energy from their power plants and efficiency standards for their vehicles, homes and buildings.
We’ve already seen the impact, as Andrew McAfee documents in his important new book, “More From Less.” Total resource use in America is now declining — even as our economy has kept growing — because rising standards like these have made us steadily more efficient and innovative.
A candidate running on the Earth Race should just say: “I’ll require all 50 states to move to such standards. When you get all 50 states imposing steadily rising standards for clean power, transportation and energy efficiency — and let the market determine the most effective solutions — you will unleash an explosion of innovation that will create thousands of products to export to the rest of the world in so many different areas of clean power, energy and efficiency — and you’ll be mitigating climate change at the same time.”
The Earth Race candidate would tell people every day: “You can vote for a man who wants to bring back cars that get bad mileage, lights that use more energy and produce more heat, power plants that produce more asthma, chemical companies that pollute more rivers, coal companies that pollute more air, mining companies that strip more pristine landscapes, and an economy that lags China in the next great global industry.
“Or you can join the Earth Race and make Donald Trump’s presidency an extinct species while saving Mother Nature’s endangered species.”
If a candidate can’t make headway with that message, either America is doomed or he or she doesn’t belong in politics.

Texto completo: Every good story needs a hero, and the saga of Brett Kavanaugh’s rise to the Supreme Court has provided one: Leland Keyser.
She also became a victim when her longtime friend, Christine Blasey Ford, decided to hit refresh on a decades-old high school incident that apparently only Ford remembers.
Keyser is the other female student whom Ford named as having been at the small party where Kavanaugh allegedly pinned her down on a bed and groped her. She is also the friend who swore under penalty of perjury that she doesn’t recall such a party or, in fact, ever having met Kavanaugh. Her comments echoed those of the other partygoers Ford named, none of whom remembered such a gathering.
This isn’t what places Keyser on the heroes’ roster. What earns her that distinction is her steadfastness, at great personal suffering, in refusing to change her story despite what she describes as pressure to she rethink her initial statement. According to a new book, "The Education of Brett Kavanaugh" by New York Times reporters Kate Kelly and Robin Pogrebin, some of Keyser’s erstwhile friends and acquaintances tried to persuade her to say she didn’t remember the party, not that it didn’t happen.
Keyser, reportedly a registered Democrat, has become increasingly convinced that Ford’s story isn’t true and doesn’t make sense, according to the book. Given their close friendship during their school days, isn’t it likely that Ford would have told her about such an attack? And, had Keyser been at the alleged party, since she already had her driver’s license and often gave Christine a ride, wouldn’t she have taken her younger friend home?
According to the book, Ford’s team of friends and advisers apparently saw Keyser as an obstacle to Ford’s narrative and brainstormed ways for her to get onboard. The book cites a group text among Ford’s acquaintances from soon after her testimony. Cheryl Amitay, who attended the same girls’ high school as Ford, wrote: "Maybe one of you guys who are friends with [Keyser] can have a heart-to-heart." And, "I don’t care, frankly, how f---ed up her life is."
A man who had gone to a neighboring boys’ school chimed in: "Perhaps it makes sense to let everyone in the public know what her condition is." To which Amitay responded, "Leland is a major stumbling block."
Keyser, a former professional golfer who has undergone numerous operations on her back and neck, has suffered addiction during her adult life. Although recovering, she told Kelly and Pogrebin she was concerned that this history would be used against her if she didn’t come up with a more-acceptable recollection of events. When pressed, however, she refused to take the easy route and protect herself.
For her integrity and valor under perceived pressure, she has been punished. Even Ford seemed to turn on her old friend, mentioning Keyser’s "significant health challenges," during her testimony, and seeming to suggest that her friend might have diminished capacities: "I’m happy that she’s focusing on herself and getting the health treatment that she needs."
This may have been one of the sweetest condemnations in the history of tossing inconvenient friends under the bus. But, importantly, Ford planted a seed of doubt about Keyser’s credibility, which has been cultivated by the Times writers. On CNN’s "Reliable Sources" Sunday, Kelly pointed to Keyser’s "memory issues ... because she has a history of substance abuse, which she acknowledges."
Oof. What a gut punch. If no one in recovery can ever be trusted again, then the world of rehabilitative addiction therapy may as well shutter its doors.
In fact, Keyser remembers very well the summer of 1982, when Ford believes the alleged incident occurred. It was the year after her grandmother introduced her to golf and Keyser became consumed with the sport, according to another book published this past summer, "Justice on Trial," by Mollie Hemingway and Carrie Severino. Keyser worked full-time in the golf pro shop at a Washington-area country club and had little time for socializing. Her hard work at school and in sports paid off with stellar grades, seven varsity letters, and acceptance to the University of Virginia, followed by a professional golfing career and a coaching position at Georgetown University.
Today, Keyser keeps a low profile, as was always her preference. She is, indeed, in fragile health from her injuries and surgeries. But Keyser can stand tall for having remained true to her convictions despite being exposed and pressured by those who seemed to have used her struggles against her. In my book, that’s heroic.

Texto completo: Bruce Springsteen has a story to tell.
That's one aspect of a young Springsteen that former manager Carl "Tinker" West noticed early on.
"He's a good storyteller," said West, who's also a giant in the surfing world thanks to his founding of Challenger Eastern Surfboards in Ocean Township. "Vini (Lopez of the future E Street Band) brought him over to the shop (in Ocean Township). He was a smart kid, sort of quiet and he wrote songs. I said, 'You just keep writing something, you guys rehearse — work here all day, make surfboards and rock 'n' roll.'"
That was the plan. It worked.
Springsteen has sold millions of records, plays to stadiums around the world, is enshrined in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2016, all for his rock 'n' rolling.
Now Springsteen, who turned 70 Monday, he's in an era of new artistic pursuits, new creative formats. The latest is the movie "Western Stars," a filmed version of his latest album. He co-directed "Western Stars" with frequent collaborator Thom Zimny. The film features a performance of the folk-rock orchestral album, and vignettes starring a solo Springsteen.
The film follows the hit "Springsteen on Broadway," which featured the Boss baring his life story, set to song and remembrance. "Springsteen on Broadway" ran from October 2017 to December 2018.
The music play was based on his New York Times best-selling memoir "Born to Run," which was released in September 2016. Springsteen did a nine-city book tour, where he greeted thousands of fans in person for hours at a stretch in a feat of physical and mental stamina.
The Boss stood on a platform, under lights, while he met fans.
Cindy Marselis of Huntington Valley, Pennsylvania, was in tears after meeting Springsteen at the Freehold Barnes and Noble signing on Sept. 27, 2016.
"I met the person I always wanted to meet," said Marselis, at the signing. "I got to kiss him. It was awesome."
Springsteen is still telling stories, and still on stage. But now he's exploring new formats for the stories, and the stories he's telling are largely his own these days.
"I think he's said this before, but he truly envisions himself as an artist and I feel that all of these projects are in service of him wanting to tap into all of the different facets of who he is," said Caroline Madden, 26, of Toms River.
Madden is set to release a book on Springsteen's music in films and TV, "Springsteen as Soundtrack: The Sound of the Boss in Film and Television," from McFarland & Co. "That's why he's so unique and has endured as an artist for so long – he doesn't settle. He's always looking to renew himself or try something new."
West saw that creative energy up close when Springsteen fronted the band Steel Mill, which West managed and did sound for.
"I liked Springsteen because those guys would go in the back of the shop and they would rehearse," West said. "Vini Lopez, Danny Federici, they would write lots of music and whenever we'd get a couple of songs together that were pretty good, we'd go and try it out at Pandemonium, right at the bottom of Sunset Avenue."
The club was less than a mile from West's surfboard factory.
"What changes his music is that he wants to write something different," West said. "He writes some great stories. Stories to me are what makes great music, especially the early stuff. The first two albums ('Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.' and 'The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle'), people are still asking for those songs. Even so, he's written a lot of stuff after that's pretty damn good."
West and Springsteen's enduring friendship is explored in the book "Born to Run" and, subsequently in "Springsteen on Broadway." A highlight of the play is West, Springsteen and West's dog driving out west in West's 1950 Chevy flat-bed truck to play a concert and meet music industry contacts.
Springsteen didn't know how to drive until he drove the Chevy truck with West in the passenger seat. West still owns the truck.
"He knew what he wanted to do, I'm pretty sure," said West of Springsteen's artistic drive. "He wanted to wow an audience and he did. He had a great band. Federici was great. Lopez was great. Little Vinnie Roslin was great."
West used his connections and hustle to get a deal with Paramount Records.
"I finally found a deal that wouldn't screw him over," West said. "Then he said 'I don't want to do Steel Mill anymore.' (I said) That's up to you."
"I introduced him to Mike Appel. He introduced him to John Hammond and the rest is history," said West of Springsteen's subsequent manager and the of the famed Columbia Records talent scout. .
The stories Springsteen has been telling in recent years are stark, revealing and confessional.
"For a long time, if I loved you or if I felt a deep attachment to you, I would hurt you if I could," says Springsteen in "Western Stars."
He talked without censor of his troubled relationship with his father in "Springsteen on Broadway" and has been candid about his struggles with mental illness.
"I have come close enough to (mental illness) where I know I am not completely well myself," Springsteen previously told Esquire. "I've had to deal with a lot of it over the years, and I'm on a variety of medications that keep me on an even keel; otherwise I can swing rather dramatically and ... just ... the wheels can come off a little bit. So we have to watch, in our family. I have to watch my kids, and I've been lucky there. It ran in my family going way before my dad."
Springsteen is married to Patti Scialfa and they have three children, Evan, 29; Jessica, 27; and Sam, 25.
Springsteen's non-rock 'n' roll work of the past few years has also framed the aging process for fans. He's showing the way to baby boomers about what to do, how to do it, and what's important in life when you get to a certain age.
The fans of his generation might have looked to John Lennon for the answers, but he didn't get to grow old like Springsteen. Lennon would have been 78 if he were still alive.
"Aging is scary but fascinating, and great talent morphs in strange and often enlightening ways," said Springsteen in "Born to Run."
There no official events planned to recognize Springsteen's 70th birthday, but"Springsteen: His Hometown," an exhibit presented by the Monmouth County Historical Association and the Bruce Springsteen Archives and Center for American Music at Monmouth University, opens Sunday at the historical association in Freehold. Ticket information is at www.SpringsteenHisHometown.com.
Preview showings of "Western Stars" are scheduled for Oct. 19 and 23 in area movie theaters. Visit www.fathomevents.com for more info and tickets.
As for the E Street Band, Springsteen ain't done yet, despite the success he's had with his new avenues of artistic expression.
"We want the band to get back together," Springsteen said to applause at the Toronto International Film Festival. "I've got some songs written for the band and I'd like to make a really good rock band record with the E Street Band.
"We'll be seeing you."

Texto completo: Concord Community Concert Association opens its 89th season of affordable, world-class music with the shimmering, colorful sounds of the Borealis Wind Quintet on Saturday at 7:30 p.m. at Concord City Auditorium.

“A polished, elegantly turned performance ... lively, communicative readings ... the performance was a scintillating one,” according to the New York Times. Nominated for a Grammy in 2006, the quintet is clearly one of the best in the world. The theme for 2019-20 is “An American Landscape,” with pieces ranging from Copland to Bernstein.
The evening starts at 7 p.m. with a dessert party and popular Fall silent auction. The CCCA $75 season ticket includes 11 concerts, with accompanying children free in Concord. Tickets and information are available at Gibson's Bookstore and The UPS Store, or online at concordcommunityconcerts.org or call 344-4747. Individual ticket prices are $20 or $23 when purchased online.
The five concerts are an eclectic mix of musical styles tailored to a Concord audience. Fall begins with the classical sounds of Borealis (described above) followed by the inventive jazz sounds of the Brubeck Brothers Quartet on Nov. 9. The Spring concerts begin with “A Grand Time for Singing” on Feb. 23, with the sounds of the N.H. Gay Men's Chorus, Suncook Valley Chorale and the N.H. Master Chorale. The groups will perform individually and together for a mid-winter celebration of New Hampshire choruses. On March 21, Richard Dowling will perform “Piano Masterpieces.” Dowling has a range from Chopin to Scott Joplin and beyond. Finally, the year finishes on April 25, with Duo Baldo from Italy, blending physical comedy and classical music in a very entertaining way! All shows begin at 7:30 p.m., except for the “Grand Time for Singing,” which begins at 3 p.m.
The season ticket also entitles members to the Nashua Community Concert Association shows.

Fall theater lineup touches on timely topics College admissions, gentrification and the 50-year anniversary of Woodstock are all explored on local stages.

Texto completo: When Cait Robinson studied theater at Bowdoin College, she and her pals passed around an anthology of plays by Sarah Ruhl with great enthusiasm.
"It went around our campus theater department like the hottest news," Robinson said. "It was like nothing we had ever read before, the way she was writing, the way she used language and imagery and poetry. It was like wildfire."
Among other plays, the anthology included Ruhl's "Eurydice" and "The Clean House." At the time, "Eurydice" was the play that spoke to 20-year-olds. "The Clean House" would be a play that Robinson returned to as an adult.
Fifteen years later, Robinson is back in Maine directing Ruhl's "The Clean House" at Portland Stage. It opens the 2019-'20 season this week and kicks off a busy fall of theater in and around Portland, with a new play at Good Theater, "Admissions," about the role of privilege and power in the college admissions process, an original script about aging rockers and a dark comedy by Mad Horse about homelessness and gentrification.
Robinson, a freelance theater artist now living in New York, describes "The Clean House" as a comedy for adults. It's a play about love and loss with lessons about forgiveness, and the complexities of an adult life, and what happens when that life begins unraveling. It premiered in 2004, and was a Pulitzer finalist for drama and helped Ruhl become a powerful voice in American theater.
On its surface, the play is about Lane and Charles, a married couple, both doctors, played by the Maine-based actors Abigail Killeen and Rob Cameron. There's also Matilde, a Brazilian maid who detests cleaning; Virginia, a sister of Lane's who loves cleaning; and Ana, an Argentinian woman and patient of Charles. Each character is dealing with grief and loss, each is on a different arc of healing, and each is struggling with an evolving identity. The tension comes as Lane and Charles navigate changes in their marriage and the presence of a cleaning lady who doesn't clean very well.
It feels timely in today's divisive environment because of its lessons about the bounty that awaits us if we dare to evolve, to look past cultural stereotypes and see people for who they actually are and not who we assume they are, Robinson said. "The play posits that people who are losing their identity, the person they thought they were - perhaps, the country they thought they were - is no longer. It doesn't look like it used to. You have to reframe it, and the play posits that on the other side of that there is joy and healing and connection," Robinson said. "By letting go of what you thought the rules were and who you thought you had to be, you can find something that is more full and lush and beautiful on the other side."
The beauty of Ruhl's play is she makes those points in poignant and subtle ways, leading the audience on a journey that begins in one place and ends somewhere else altogether. Cameron called Ruhl's play "staggeringly beautiful because of the poetry, which you don't get much in modern theater." Killeen described it as "perplexing and delicate," and having musicality despite its lack of music. "It's poetry that is active and act-able," she said.
Killeen promised that people who attend the play will be moved and surprised. "The audience will have a personal experience with this play, collectively. It will make you feel something you don't expect."
GOOD THEATER
Soon after Brian Allen committed to "Admissions" by Joshua Harmon, the college admissions scandal broke, bringing questions about the role of wealth and privilege in that process to the fore. Earlier this month the actress Felicity Huffman was sentenced to prison for paying money to improve her daughter's test scores so she would be admitted to the elite college of her choice.
"Thank you, Felicity Huffman," Allen said. "You turned this issue into front-page news."
Good Theater, which presents its plays at the St. Lawrence Arts Center in Portland, opens "Admissions" on Oct. 2. But before that the theater company Allen co-founded celebrates his 60th birthday with "Life with Brian," a revue-style show with embarrassing videos, funny sketches and poignant songs - and champagne and cake - at 7:30 p.m. Saturday and 2 p.m. Sunday at the St. Lawrence.
The cast of celebrants includes two-time Tony Award-nominee Bob Stillman, Valerie Perri, who stars in "Admissions," and local friends Steve Underwood, Lynne McGhee, Hannah Daly, Gusta Johnson, Shannon Thurston, Laura Houck, Jen Means, Amy Roche, Meredith Bruskin, Denise Poirier, Kathleen Kimball and Victoria Stubbs.
"Admissions" is a play about racial representation and indicts pious lefties whose ideals are upended when personal ambition runs into progressive values. In a review from 2018, The New York Times described Harmon's play as a "no-holds-barred look at privilege, power and the perils of hypocrisy."
The play centers on Sherri Roen-Mason, head of admissions at a New England prep school, and her husband, the school's headmaster. They are liberal and white, and fully committed to diversifying the student body of their school. They've done a good job recruiting non-white students, but their personal world is jolted when their son doesn't get into Yale while a best friend does.
Allen directs a cast of mostly Maine actors: Griffin Carpenter, James Hoban, Amy Roche and Laura Houck. Perri, a New York actress whom Allen hired to sing in Broadway at Good Theater last year, plays the admissions director.
"Life With Brian," 7:30 p.m Saturday and 2 p.m. Sunday; "Admissions," Oct. 2-27, St. Lawrence Arts Center; goodtheater.com or (207) 835-0895.
'ROCK 'N ROLL'
"Rock n Roll" is a new play by Portland actor and playwright Kevin O'Leary about friendship, faith and the power of music, 50 years after Woodstock. O'Leary wrote it over the course of many years, tapping his love of the Rolling Stones to provide the soundtrack and blueprint for his story.
The play opens Thursday in the studio theater at Portland Stage and runs through Oct. 6.
The on-stage story begins Dec. 18, 1969, the 26th birthday of Stones guitarist Keith Richards. Rake Donovan is hosting a party with his girlfriend and their friends in Keith's honor, and to devour "Let it Bleed," which had just come out. But the dawn of the 1970s bodes ill for these friends, who drift apart as the hopeful spirit of Woodstock begins to fade away.
The story continues 20 years later, on Dec. 18, 1989. The Stones are still at it, but Rake is slipping away and the friends have mostly dispersed.
"Rock 'n Roll" is about friendship, trust and forgiveness. It stars Sean Ramey, Marie Stewart Harmon, Chris Davis, Peter Brown, Raheem Brooks and Robbie Harrison. O'Leary directs.
"Rock 'n Roll," Thursday, Sept. 26, through Oct. 6, Portland Stage Studio Theater, 25A Forest Ave; $25; rocknroll.brownpapertickets.com or 207-831-2434.
MAD HORSE
Mad Horse Theatre Company opens its 34th season with "Radiant Vermin," a play that director Jake Cote thinks is perfect for Portland. "I love this play because of the very smart way it deals with gentrification and homelessness, two issues tied hand in hand and absolutely ravishing Portland right now," said Cote, a Mad Horse company member who is making his directorial debut with this play.
"Radiant Vermin" is about a young couple with a baby on the way and their quest to climb the property ladder. They want to raise their baby in a nice neighborhood and are willing to go to great lengths to make it happen. It opens Thursday and runs through Oct. 13 at the Mad Horse performance space at 24 Mosher St., South Portland.
The question posed by playwright Philip Ridley is how far do you go to get your dream home. Cote describes it as a dark comedy with sci-fi elements that explores how decent people ignore their consciences to get what they think they want. The crux of the play is the decision process of the couple as they navigate their offer, opportunity and dilemma.
"I am excited to hear people's reactions," Cote said. "I would love to hear everybody's talk in the car on the way home."
It's set in England. Cote said company members talked about setting it in Portland "to hit the nail on the head a little bit more." They decided not to because of the benefit of looking at the issue of gentrification from afar. Removing the play from its intended setting might take away from that perspective, he said.
It stars company member Allison McCall, and guests Joe Bearor and Dana Legawiec.
"Radiant Vermin," opens Thursday, Sept. 26, through Oct. 13, Mad Horse Theatre, 24 Mosher St., South Portland; $20 to $23; madhorse.com or 207-747-4148.

White House Bars Iranian Officials From U.S. as Bid for Diplomacy Fails

Texto completo: UNITED NATIONS -- The Trump administration barred senior Iranian government officials from entering the United States on Wednesday, just hours after a failed attempt to renew diplomacy with President Hassan Rouhani as he attended an annual gathering of world leaders in New York.
The order followed a new round of American economic penalties against China, Iran's largest oil customer, to further squeeze the Iranian economy and force Tehran into new negotiations to limit its nuclear and military programs.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the United States was still open to talking to Iran, and hoped to tamp down inflamed tensions after leaders in the United States, Europe and Arab nations blamed Tehran for attacks on oil fields in Saudi Arabia this month.
"We want peace and we want a peaceful resolution," Mr. Pompeo said during a news conference Wednesday afternoon with President Trump. "In the end, it will be up to the Iranians to make that decision whether they choose violence and hate."
The White House announced the new travel restrictions on senior Iranian government officials and their family members shortly after the news conference ended. In a statement, it described the Iranian government as a state sponsor of terrorism that threatened the stability of the Middle East and beyond.
It was an extraordinary declaration, given its timing: Mr. Rouhani and more than 80 of his top diplomats and aides were in New York attending the annual United Nations General Assembly. However, the travel ban was not expected to force them to leave; the United States generally issues visas to allow foreign leaders to come to United Nations headquarters, but tightly restricts their movements while in New York.
A similar travel ban was issued against members of President Nicolás Maduro's government in Venezuela, which the Trump administration is trying to oust.
In a morning speech to the General Assembly, Mr. Rouhani appeared to shut down any attempt at détente with what he described as an "enemy who uses sanction and poverty as a tool." He also devoted considerable time to berating the Trump administration for inviting him to talk while threatening Iran.
"If you want a 'yes' response, then the only road to negotiations is returning to your commitments," Mr. Rouhani said, referring to Mr. Trump's repudiation of a 2015 nuclear accord that eased international sanctions in return for limiting Iran's nuclear activities. "A photo opportunity is the last stop, not the first stop."
The new economic sanctions were announced by Mr. Pompeo at a conference sponsored by United Against Nuclear Iran, an advocacy group that Tehran this week said it was considering declaring a terrorist organization.
Mr. Pompeo said the sanctions would punish six Chinese companies and five business executives for defying American financial restrictions that aim to stop Iran from exporting oil. The targeted businesses are an oil company and five shipping companies, two of which are subsidiaries of a large state-owned conglomerate, China COSCO Shipping. But the parent company is not a target.
China has been the biggest foreign buyer of Iran's oil, a crucial Iranian export. Last year, roughly 6 percent of China's oil imports came from Iran. But in the past two months, Chinese state-owned companies have begun importing more oil from Saudi Arabia under tightening pressure from the Trump administration.
A New York Times investigation found that at least six Iranian tankers unloaded at Chinese ports during a two-month period after the United States on May 2 ended purchase waivers for Iranian oil granted to China and seven other governments.
In July, the State Department announced its first set of Iran-related sanctions against a Chinese oil company. But the United States has avoided sanctioning Chinese banks or Sinopec, a much larger state-owned company that is also a big importer of Iranian oil. Sanctions on those institutions would have far-reaching effects in global finance and business.
Some analysts believe the oil sanctions and other penalties imposed by the Trump administration are what set Tehran on its current course of confrontation with the United States and its partners in the Persian Gulf region.
The administration's so-called maximum pressure campaign "has not only failed to secure a better deal with Iran on its nuclear activities and problematic Iranian regional behavior, but actually created problems that did not previously exist," said Andrew Miller, a former State Department official who is deputy director for policy at the Project on Middle East Democracy.
European officials, led by President Emmanuel Macron of France, had for weeks sought to broker talks between the United States and Iran on the sidelines of the General Assembly.
Diplomats from the nations still party to the 2015 nuclear accord -- Britain, China, France, Germany, Iran and Russia -- all committed during a Wednesday morning meeting to try to preserve it, said Federica Mogherini, the European Union's foreign policy chief.
"We all welcome the efforts being made to open the channel of dialogue," said Ms. Mogherini. She predicted it would be difficult to save the nuclear deal but said Iran could easily return to compliance.
Iran's foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, described it as "a good meeting" but declined to comment further.
The diplomatic breakdown followed an overnight flurry of messages between Iranian and European officials about a possible meeting on Wednesday between Mr. Rouhani and Mr. Trump.
Hard-line members of the power hierarchy in Iran who are especially suspicious of the American government applauded Mr. Rouhani's rejection of talks. "If such a thing happens Messrs Rouhani and Zarif must know they will pay a very high price," said Javad Karimi Ghodoosi, a member of Parliament.
At the nuclear conference, Mr. Pompeo appeared to taunt Iran, describing its "panicked aggression" in reaction to the American pressure campaign. He also said Iran's leaders respond to "strength and not to supplication" and drew titters from the audience when he noted that Mr. Rouhani had claimed of working to bring peace to the Middle East.
In his speech, Mr. Pompeo again accused Iran of bombing four oil tankers in the Persian Gulf in May, downing an unmanned American spy drone in June and attacking oil fields in Saudi Arabia this month as evidence of its "long history of unprovoked aggression."
Iran has denied responsibility for the Sept. 14 strikes on the Saudi oil facilities, which Mr. Pompeo has called an "act of war" and which again raised the specter of a new military conflict in the Middle East. Officials in the Gulf also blamed Iran for the attacks but urged caution, and not until this week did diplomats from Britain, France and Germany publicly agree that they considered Tehran responsible for the strikes.
Mr. Pompeo said the United States also would intensify warnings to countries and companies against doing business with entities linked to the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, a branch of Iran's military. The United States declared the Revolutionary Guards a terrorist organization this year; the broad designation prohibits doing business with as many as 11 million Iranians and affiliated groups.
The developments at the United Nations unfolded as the fate of a Swedish-owned, British-flagged oil tanker, the Steno Impero, detained in Iran for months, remained unclear two days after the Iranians said the ship was free to leave.
An Iranian official on Wednesday said that while the detention order on the ship had been lifted, it may not leave Iran because of a pending inquiry into the ship's conduct.
The ship has not budged from the southern Iranian port of Bandar Abbas. Its seizure was widely seen as retaliation for the earlier detention of an Iranian vessel, the Grace 1, later renamed the Adrian Darya, in Gibraltar. That vessel was released in August.
Rick Gladstone contributed reporting from New York, and Megan Specia from London.

Texto completo: With Washington abuzz with the news that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had opened an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump on Tuesday, U.S. Rep. Lloyd Smucker condemned the actions of his Democratic peers and called on his supporters to come to the aid of the president.
In an initial statement issued by his government spokesperson, Smucker called out Democrats for “rushing to condemn the President on hearsay and without all the information.”
Smucker’s re-election campaign followed up with a separate email — titled “URGENT: President Trump needs our support” — about an hour later. In it, the campaign announced every dollar Smucker raised Tuesday night would be split between Trump’s reelection campaign and his own.
“Trump Derangement Syndrome is alive and well in the Democratic Party and tonight’s call for impeachment only proves that the left has no interest in working for the American people,” the campaign email reads.
Smucker’s earlier statement referred to House Democrats’ past attempts to take action on Trump, including the Mueller inquiry.
“Remember when the Democrat Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff, said for two years that he had proof, beyond circumstantial, of Russian collusion? He lied. The conclusion from the Attorney General following the extensive Mueller report was, in fact, No collusion,” Smucker started his statement.

Read Smucker's full statement
“Remember when the Democrat Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff, said for two years that he had proof, beyond circumstantial, of Russian collusion? He lied. The conclusion from the Attorney General following the extensive Mueller report was, in fact, No collusion.
So, we should be highly skeptical of the Democrats who are, again, rushing to condemn the President on hearsay and without all the information. For example, we know the whistleblower was not in the room when the call with the President of Ukraine took place. President Trump has confirmed that he will release on Thursday the complete, full declassified and un-redacted transcript of his phone call with President Zelensky of Ukraine. Democrats are rushing to impeachment without the facts -- and the facts are currently unclear.
The Democrats have made clear that their partisan obstruction agenda of impeaching the President is more important than actually solving the issues the American people elected us to solve.”
------------
The 448-page Mueller Report found that Trump was elected with help from Russia’s election meddling campaign and that he was not fully exonerated as he often claims, the New York Times reported. Mueller testified in July that he did not clear Trump of obstruction of justice in his report, but he nevertheless chose not to indict the president.
Trump announced Tuesday he authorized the release of a declassified and unredacted transcript of a call between him and Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky that has become the subject of controversy. The call is allegedly the subject of a whistleblower complaint, although the director of national intelligence has yet to forward the complaint to Congress.

Texto completo: With its bright tropical colors, its island-casual atmosphere and its world-famous Key lime pie, Captiva's Keylime Bistro has been an island fixture since 2002. That's when local hospitality powerhouse Sandy Stilwell Youngquist bought the restaurant and turned it into the destination it is today.
Youngquist purchased the neighboring Captiva Island Inn in 1999, when the bistro was called Terrace Tropical Grill. It had carpeted floors, lace curtains and servers dressed in black. When people checking into Youngquist's inn asked her for a recommendation on where to eat, she'd point them next door.
"Oh no," the guests would say, eyeing the formal wait staff and stiff decor, "we don't want anything that fancy."
Youngquist gently suggested to the restaurant that they tone down the formality and try a more casual approach, but no one took her up on the idea. When the restaurant came up for sale in 2002, she decided to try it herself.
Keylime Bistro was Youngquist's first restaurant venture, though she'd taken classes in food and beverage management at The Hotel School at Cornell in Ithaca, New York.
"I'd never done anything other than be a dishwasher in my uncle's restaurant," she said.
"It was a little scary. I hired somebody that was a very good chef, well-respected, and he had the same attitude that I have — which is to roll up your sleeves and get in there."
While she worked on the menu with the chef, adding breakfast in addition to lunch and dinner, she also made some cosmetic changes to the dining areas. She pulled up the carpet. She took down the lace curtains. She had the booths carried out into the parking lot and beaten with chains to give them a weathered look.
Then she painted everything in island-inspired blues, greens, yellows and purples.
"It looked like it had been there forever as a little bistro," Youngquist said.
"We made the interior real casual, fun and funky. At that time, it was really a unique thing to do around here. Really nothing else was quite that bright, just the Bubble Room and us."
Today, Keylime Bistro draws customers from Youngquist's inn next door as well as locals visiting the island for the day. At breakfast, diners are fans of the crab-cake Benedict, as well as the huevos rancheros and the crunchy French toast.
"It's not exactly low calorie, but it's really good," Youngquist said of the custard-and-batter-dipped French toast.
At lunch, the restaurant offers an array of salads and sandwiches as well as a full menu of appetizers. Dinner features seafood, meats and pastas with a Florida-Caribbean influence. Youngquist said the lobster-stuffed grouper is the bistro's most popular dish.
And for dessert?
The Keylime Bistro's signature Key lime pie, of course. The dish has been featured in Gourmet and Bon Appetit magazines, and it's received international recognition, too.
Youngquist shared her favorite Key lime pie moment:
"I was in Paris with my husband at a convention for his business," she said, "and someone says, 'I was in Captiva recently, and I had the best dinner and the best Key lime pie.' He told us where it was, at the bistro, and my husband welled up with pride and said, 'My wife owns that.' It was really sweet to be known all around."
In addition to its menu and famous pie, the Keylime Bistro regularly hosts live music. And you'll often see it hosting local events and supporting Southwest Florida charities.
"It's part of what we do," Youngquist said. "Being a community partner is really important."

The Democrats' risky bet on impeachment

Texto completo: Precedents abound in a country whose first presidential election took place 230 years ago, and which has seen 41 presidential contests between two political parties founded 187 and 165 years ago. Three of our 44 presidents have faced impeachment proceedings — Andrew Johnson, Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton — and now it seems that Donald Trump will be the fourth.
Democrats have been itching to oust Trump from office since the 9:00 p.m. hour Eastern Standard Time on election night, nearly three years ago, when it became clear he had won. High law enforcement and intelligence officials, despite having little more than a dossier full of unverified Russian-supplied hearsay evidence, had been trying to keep him from the White House starting months earlier. For more than two years, they pushed the theory that he and his campaign were acting in collusion with Russia.
Collusiongate finally collapsed, in the words of New York Times editor Dean Baquet, “the day Bob Mueller walked off that witness stand” when “our readers who want Donald Trump to go away” realized that wasn’t going to happen.
So now, weeks before the promised release of the inspector general's reports on law enforcement misconduct, we hear that a whistleblower had been told by someone that Trump abused his powers in a telephone conversation with the president of Ukraine. So on Tuesday afternoon, Trump announced he would release the transcript. Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced immediately that the Democratic-majority House was officially considering impeachment.
The transcript released Wednesday doesn’t read exactly as the still-anonymous whistleblower claimed. Trump had supposedly asked the newly installed Ukraine president to investigate 2016 anti-Trump efforts there, offering a quid pro quo, and in exchange, he’d release U.S. aid that he’d been holding up.
But Trump said nothing about that. And given his broad powers, any American president’s request of a foreign government can be called a threat.
Trump also mentioned Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, who had a $50,000 a month contract with a Ukraine firm, and adverted to the elder Biden’s public boast that, as vice president, he threatened to deny Ukraine $1 billion in aid if the government didn’t fire the prosecutor investigating the firm.
On Collusiongate, Democrats followed the Nixon precedent, allowing a special prosecutor and congressional committees to conduct long investigations, with numerous leaks to sympathetic media. That produced evidence that made impeachment certain and Nixon resigned. But Collusiongate didn’t pan out the same way.
Now Democrats seem to be following the Andrew Johnson precedent. Johnson’s Republican critics hated him for obstructing equal rights for free blacks and for his vitriolic and scurrilous oratory. Proceedings began on February 24, 1868. The House voted for impeachment on March 3, and on May 16, the Senate voted 35-19 against him, which was one vote short of the two-thirds needed to remove him from office.
So now Democrats’ course is, as my Washington Examiner colleague Byron York puts it, “Move fast. Don’t withhold judgment. And don’t wait for the results of a long, ponderous investigation.” Pelosi seems primed to push for a quick vote, as soon as 218 votes are in sight. But in the 53-47 Republican Senate, absent new facts or changed public opinion, there are far fewer votes for removal than there were in 1868.
Current polling shows voters oppose impeachment by a nearly 2-1 ratio, similar to when Bill Clinton was impeached in 1998. Both parties thought impeachment would help them politically. Clinton’s job approval rose sharply, but his personal ratings slumped badly. The former helped keep him in office, while the latter hobbled his chosen successor Al Gore two years later.
Speaker Newt Gingrich forecast big Republican gains, but they actually lost four seats in November 1998 and Gingrich lost his speakership. Still, Republicans held on to their House majority that year and in the next three congressional elections.
Those largely positive results reflect late 1990s contentment and the fact that both parties had intellectually serious arguments in line with their values. Republicans argued that Clinton’s lies in a federal court proceeding violated his constitutional duty to faithfully execute the laws. Democrats argued that his offense was only a personal matter unrelated to his official duties.
Donald Trump’s support has remained impervious to charges of personal or professional misconduct, just as his detractors remain impervious to claims that his policies have been successful. What could hurt Democrats in times of discontent, when impeachment is unpopular, is their opportunism in seizing on any excuse to vent their rage. The Ukraine phone call is much smaller potatoes than collusion with Russia would have been.
But Democrats “who want Donald Trump to go away” just couldn’t wait to let voters make that choice. They risk four more years of angry frustration.

Frank Bruni: Why a Trump impeachment terrifies me

Texto completo: President Donald Trump deserves to be impeached. But the prospect terrifies me, and it should terrify you, too.
That’s not to say that it’s the wrong move. Arguably, it’s the only move, at least in terms of fidelity to the Constitution and to basic decency. From the moment that Trump stepped into the office of the presidency, he has degraded it — with words that a president has no business speaking (or tweeting); with ceaseless lies; with infantile and often unhinged behavior; with raging conflicts of interest; with managerial ineptitude; with a rapacious ego that’s never sated; and with foreign dealings that compromise America’s values, independence and interests. How can principled lawmakers not tell him, in the most emphatic manner available, that enough is enough?
But there’s no way to say what happens now that a formal impeachment inquiry is being opened. None. You’re going to hear a lot in coming days and weeks about Bill Clinton, but using the example of his impeachment in late 1998 is a bit ridiculous: He was a very different president accused of very different offenses at a very different time. Besides which, political analysts who do cite it don’t agree on the lessons. So a pundit making confident predictions about the political fallout from the impeachment of Trump is a pundit far out on a slender limb.
Any scenario is possible, including one in which impeachment redounds to Trump’s benefit and increases the chances of his reelection because he paints himself a martyr, eludes conviction in the Senate, frames that as exoneration and watches his fans mobilize and turn out as never before. And a second Trump term wouldn’t just be the sadly suboptimal byproduct of a noble stand; it would be disastrous. Morally as well as practically, limiting this unfit, amoral, unsteady man’s time in the presidency takes precedence over any small cluster of sentences written centuries ago.
But while an impeachment’s effect on November 2020 is unknowable, its effect on us as a nation is almost certain. A dangerously polarized and often viciously partisan country would grow more so, with people on opposing sides hunkering down deeper in their camps and clinging harder to their chosen narratives as the president — concerned only with himself — ratcheted up his insistence that truth itself was subjective and up for grabs.
That’s not a reason to blink, but it’s a reality to brace for. At a juncture when we so desperately need to rediscover common ground, we’d be widening the fault lines. Bringing the country together afterward would call for more than a talented politician; it would demand a miracle worker. None of the Democratic presidential candidates qualify.
Impeachment should terrify you because it would mean a continued, relentless, overwhelming focus on Trump’s lawlessness, antics, fictions and inane tweets. He would win in the short term — and all Americans would lose — because as long as most of the oxygen in Washington is consumed by the ghastly carnival of this barker, there’s too little left for the nation’s very real problems and for scrutiny of his substantive inadequacy in addressing them.
From the House Republicans’ persecution of Hillary Clinton though the permanent hysteria of House Democrats under Trump, Washington has devolved ever further into a place where process muscles out progress, grandstanding eclipses governing and noise muffles any meaningful signal. To be engaged in politics is to be engaged in battle — and that shouldn’t and needn’t always be so.
Where’s the infrastructure plan that we’re — oh — a quarter-century late in implementing? Where are the fixes to a health care system whose problems go far beyond the tens of millions of Americans still uninsured? What about education? Impeachment would shove all of those issues even further to the margins than it already is.
During the Democratic primary and then the general election, the Trump melodrama and the Trump spectacle would overshadow all else. And many Americans’ estrangement from Washington — their cynicism about its ability to improve their lives even a whit — would intensify.
That could be all the more true on account of their confusion. If you’re favorably disposed toward Trump and receptive to his claims of persecution, you’ve watched the meticulous and drawn-out work of Robert Mueller, you’ve noticed a seemingly nonstop schedule of Capitol Hill hearings and of star witnesses (Michael Cohen, Mueller, Bill Barr, Corey Lewandowski), and you thought that the House Judiciary Committee was already doing an impeachment inquiry. The latest developments strike you as “Groundhog Day” on the Potomac.
If you’re horribly offended and utterly exhausted by Trump, you’re tempted to cheer impeachment as long-sought justice and prayed-for release and forget that it’s just the prelude to the main act, which is a trial in the Senate. That chamber is controlled by Republicans, who, based on current conditions, are as likely to convict Trump as they are to co-sponsor Elizabeth Warren’s wealth tax. So Trump’s supporters would wind up furious that he was put through what they regarded as an overwrought exercise with a foregone conclusion, while the frustration of Trump’s detractors would be exponentially multiplied. Let the healing begin!
And would impeachment proceedings effectively lay bare — and force Americans to focus on — sins of Trump’s that are being ignored? That’s long been one of Democrats’ arguments for impeachment, but I wonder. For starters, some of the hearings to date — Lewandowski’s in particular — raise questions about their ability to pry loose what they want from witnesses and isolate the damning evidence amid the ambient vitriol. But more than that, there has been such saturation coverage of Trump that many voters may not be able to stomach it any more, and today’s political tribalism doesn’t allow for all that much in the way of epiphanies and transformations. Trump’s true colors were conspicuous from the start. You either saw a perverse rainbow or you stared into darkness.
Meanwhile, Trump. How vulnerable will drawn-out impeachment proceedings make him feel? How impotent? How desperate? To flex his power, vent his fury or distract the audience, what would he do? He’s untethered by scruple. He’s capable of anything. Maybe it’s not just a culture war that he’d whip up. Maybe it’s the real thing.
Certainly he’d do all he could to convince Americans of the nefariousness of Democrats, and absolutely his strategy would be to smear the people, the procedures and the institutions arrayed against him as utterly unworthy of trust. If holding on to power meant ruling over rubble, so be it. Trump is beholden only to Trump, and he’d simply declare the rubble gold dust.

Texto completo: Common denominator of hate — guns Recently a white gunman shot and killed 13 innocent Mexican people in El Paso, Texas, just because they were of Mexican nationality. Earlier a white person in New Zealand shot and killed about 50 Muslims because they had a different religion.
Sometime ago, a young white supremacist hating blacks killed nine black parishioners in Charleston, South Carolina. Soon after, a former black soldier went to Dallas, Texas, shot and killed five white policemen and wounded others because he did not like white people, especially white policemen. After that horrendous deed, 11 innocent Jewish people were shot and killed in a synagogue simply because they were Jewish.
Around that time a black individual hating Christians, especially black pastors traveled to Atlanta with a gun intending to kill Dr. Martin Luther King’s father, but was only able to kill Dr. King’s mother and another worshipper in the church.
In Florida, a young man of Middle East origins went to the Pulse night club intending to kill everyone inside with an AK-47 rifle to express dissatisfaction with U.S. policy in Iraq and Syria killing 49 innocent gay Latino boys, their sexual orientation was not involved. A man who hated Republicans intended to kill everyone at he Republican Annual Baseball Game, only able to severely wound Rep. Scalise. Because of dissatisfaction a student in Arizona shot Democrat Rep. Gifford, only paralyzing her, killing six others in her crowd. The U.S. government’s use of force at the Branch Davidian compound, three individuals bombed the Federal Building in Omaha, killing 169 people including 15 day care children.
Where do these hateful killers come from. All that someone needs to express anger is obtain a gun and kill a number of people. Restrictions must be placed on gun purchases for the protection of the American people.
Stewart E. Brekke Downers Grove Press is protection against corruption In a recent letter to the editor Mr. Laszlo Stephan all but accused the press of being traitors in their investigation of Donald Trump and his administration.
Well, I hate to burst your bubble, but to my way of thinking, they are the only ones who are keeping this country from becoming a dictatorship.
Perhaps Mr. Stephan should take an adult course in world history to fully comprehend the danger in threatening the freedom of the press.
If Donald Trump has much to fear from The New York Times and Washington Post, it’s his own doing. The corruption he brought to the White House has only been extended as our commander in chief.
People should pray that this president isn’t given four more years to undermine our nation’s greatness.

Texto completo: Just as the aftershocks of the special counsel's Russia investigation seemed to have settled, the latest tremblor out of the Oval Office is whether the president used the levers of his foreign policy toward Ukraine for political gain.
A confidential whistleblower report might provide an answer. But once again, the nation's democratic processes are falling short of providing Americans what they need to decide whether Donald Trump did something wrong.
Short of someone violating the law by leaking that whistleblower complaint, or the whistleblower risking retaliation by bravely going to Congress, there's no quick or certain process for the public to learn its contents.
There is, however, a steady drip of news media reports, and a few admissions by Trump himself on Sunday.
According to The Washington Post and The New York Times, a whistleblower complaint filed with the intelligence community's inspector general focused on a promise Trump made during a phone call on July 25 with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
During that conversation, Trump asked the Kiev leader to investigate a key political opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden, and Biden's son Hunter, regarding the younger Biden's past business dealings in Ukraine.
Still unclear is whether there's any connection between Trump's desire for dirt on the Bidens and $250 million in U.S. military aid for Ukraine, which is engaged in a five-year conflict with pro-Russian separatists. The aid was inexplicably delayed, then released a day after Congress raised concerns about the whistleblower complaint.
Was a meeting with Zelensky or the promise of Ukrainian assistance somehow, by inference or otherwise, made contingent on Kiev investigating Biden? If true, that would be a gross abuse of presidential power.
Trump acknowledged Sunday that he spoke with Zelensky about Biden, defending the conversation as appropriate and "perfect." If that's the case, why not make everything public?
The intelligence community's inspector general, Trump appointee Michael Atkinson, was so troubled by the whistleblower's report that he deemed it of "urgent concern."
The law requires that an urgent-concern whistleblower complaint "shall" be turned over to Congress. But the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, blocked this on the grounds that the alleged target of the complaint — presumably Trump himself — is not a member of the intelligence community.
A system of checks and balances guaranteed by the Constitution should inform the American people when their president violates the law or commits an impeachable offense. That system is being stretched to the breaking point.
Now it's up to members of Congress — not just Democrats but also Republicans who claim to believe in the rule of law — to get to the bottom of this latest tawdry tale by holding hearings, obtaining transcripts, and finding a way to gain access to the whistleblower complaint or that person's testimony.

Spaying or neutering pets has reduced euthanasia

Texto completo: You know that sense of happiness and purpose you get when you are met with wags and wet kisses or purrs and head rubs from your best friend after a long day? That describes how I felt after reading a recent analysis by the New York Times.
After examining data from municipal shelters in the nation's 20 largest cities, the Times noted a sharp decline – 75 percent since 2009 – in pet euthanasia.
To everyone who views their pets as members of their family, this is as good as it gets. And the findings are especially sweet for those of us work in the animal community, because the analysis credits spaying and neutering for the decline in the number of unwanted animals put to sleep.
Spaying/neutering pets has become the norm for responsible pet owners in America, though not everyone is sold on the idea. Some think that desexing our dogs and cats is a bad thing or can be detrimental to our pets' health. They raise some interesting points that deserve to be explored.
Myth: Spay/neuter is bad for my pet's health. My experience proves the opposite: that spay/neuter could be the single best decision you make for your pet's health. Here's why: spay/neuter helps ward off cancer and other diseases. Spaying is the only way to completely prevent pyometra, a costly and possibly deadly uterine infection, and is the only way to reduce the likelihood of breast tumors that are malignant or cancerous in about half of dogs and 90 percent of cats. Studies have shown that pets who are spayed/neutered also live the longest. Although some will say there are studies that show their negative health effects for large dogs who are spayed/neutered as puppies, these studies cover a very small portion of purebred dogs and the link between the two is unclear at best.
Myth: Spay/neuter will change my pet's behavior. The truth is that spay/neuter will improve your pet's behavior in a good way. Dogs will be less inclined to mark their territory and cats will have less of an urge to spray. Part of the reduced lifespan of unaltered pets can be attributed to their increased urge to roam, exposing them to fights with other animals, getting struck by cars and other disasters.
Myth: I don't need to spay/neuter my pets until they are older. On the contrary, the benefits of spaying/neutering pets when they are young (about 3 months and as little as three pounds) is well documented. After all, puppies and kittens can reproduce as early as 4 months of age. What's more, one female cat and her offspring can produce more than 400,000 cats, and one female dog and her offspring can produce more than 60,000 puppies. And we know that spay/neuter in puppies and kittens is very safe; they are back to normal faster than their adult counterparts.
Myth: Spay/neuter is expensive. Taking care of your pets in this way does not have to break the bank. Altered Tails is just one example of a high-volume, high-quality clinic that makes spaying/neutering pets affordable. Thanks to funding from organizations such as PetSmart Charities, the Petco Foundation, Nina Mason Pulliam Charitable Trust and others, we are fortunate to offer spay and neuter services for an average of 75 percent less than the usual cost. You can look for specials on spay/neuter by reputable organizations too.
Since 2003, Altered Tails has performed 200,000 spay and neuter surgeries at our Phoenix and Mesa clinics. We also are one of seven Valley animal welfare groups that participate in the innovative Fix.Adopt.Save. initiative designed to reduce intake and euthanasia in community shelters. Since the initiative launched in 2012, the intake of animals into shelters has declined by 40 percent and the euthanasia rate has plummeted by 86 percent.
The benefits are clear: spaying/neutering your pet is the right thing to do.
Dr. Nellie Goetz is executive director of Altered Tails, a non-profit organization that provides accessible and affordable high-quality spay/neuter services. For more information, visit www.alteredtails.org.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Republicans appear to be sticking by President Donald Trump despite concerns he sought foreign help to discredit Democratic opponent Joe Biden.
The latest controversy riling up the White House revolves around Trump's contacts with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, a whistleblower complaint at a U.S. intelligence agency and whether Trump conditioned the granting military aid to Ukraine on an investigation into the former Vice President's son, Hunter Biden.
Trump has acknowledged bringing up Biden, the former vice president and leading Democratic 2020 presidential contender, in a July phone call with Zelensky, but he denied offering the aid in exchange for an investigation into Biden.
"I didn't do it," Trump told reporters on Monday in New York at the United Nations General Assembly.
Many Senate Republicans on Monday resisted saying too much about the controversy, dodging questions by reporters and stressing that none of the information about the complaint or the president's conversations has been verified. But others downplayed the issue, saying this was another attempt by Democrats to amplify impeachment efforts. Some also repeated comments that the president himself has made that Biden should be investigated and that's what the media should be focusing on.
Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin met with Zelensky in Ukraine earlier this month and said before his visit, he talked with Trump on the phone. Johnson said he hoped he could convince Trump to approve of the aid so he could relay that message in person to Zelensky. Trump declined.
"The rationale that he gave [me] is the concern about corruption in Ukraine, which is what I relayed to President Zelensky, and they all acknowledge it. It's why he won the election. They're trying to rid the country of corruption," Johnson said, adding Trump "did not mention anything about Joe Biden or anything" during their phone call.
Johnson said he didn't believe the whistleblower complaint should be made available to Congress, nor should a transcript of Trump's call with Zelensky. "It's a very dangerous precedent" to start, he said of releasing the call and said it does not appear the complaint is "something necessarily has to have."
Sen. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blamed Democrats for choosing to "politicize this issue." He said their actions are "circumventing the established procedures and protocols that exist so the committees can pursue sensitive matters in the appropriate, deliberate, bipartisan manner."
"What I really see happening is that Democrats are winding up the outrage machine again," said Sen. John Barrasso, the third highest-ranking Republican in the Senate, adding it's all about "beating the impeachment drum."
"They didn't get what they wanted out of the Mueller investigation," said Barrasso, R-Wyo. "They're hoping they have something here. I just don't see it."
McConnell also noted that he personally talked with the Secretary of Defense and Secretary of State to "ensure that Ukraine received this much-needed assistance."
Republicans were divided over whether those materials should be made available to Congress.
Several Republicans expressed unease with the reports about Trump's conversation with Zelensky and stressed the need for more information. Utah Republican Sen. Mitt Romney said it would be "very serious" if Trump demanded an investigation into Biden and stressed that Congress needs more information on what happened.
Sen. Susan Murkowski, R-Alaska, also said while there aren't facts showing Trump requested an investigation into Biden in exchange for the aid, "it's not OK to make a request that's a quid-pro-quo." She said it would be "helpful" having a transcript of the president's call and more information on the whistleblower complaint from the inspector general of the intelligence community.
Both the acting Director of National Intelligence, Joseph Maguire, and the inspector general Michael Atkinson could appear this week before the Senate Intelligence Committee.
Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., echoed concerns of president and his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, that Biden's conduct should be looked into.
"I think one, we have to get more information about what the President said. And also, we have to get an understanding of exactly what Biden did," Scott said.
The New York Times reported in May that Biden, while in office in 2016, threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees unless Ukraine reduced its corruption. Part of that demand called for removing the country's top prosecutor, who was investigating the oligarch behind an energy company where Hunter Biden served on the board.
The prosecutor was accused by U.S. officials of ignoring corruption in his own office. The Ukrainian Parliament eventually voted him out.

Texto completo: Headnote 2020 ELECTION
Generational Debate
HOUSTON - A groan erupted at a debate watch party at Texas Southern University earlier this month as former Vice President Joe Biden got a question about slavery and racism and gave an answer about Venezuela and record players.
But amid that exasperation, some students channeled their inner Beltway operatives and began a targeted rapid-response campaign.
Tyler Smith, 19, texted his grandmother after the debate, hopeful that Biden's meandering answer may have swayed her from supporting him.
Amaya St. Romain, 19, mounted a three-day lobbying blitz on her mother and her great-grandmother, making sure they had seen the former housing secretary Julian Castro's criticisms of Biden onstage.
In meme-speak, the efforts amounted to Killmonger, the villain in the "Black Panther" movie, challenging the people of Wakanda: "Is this your king?"
"I think I'm definitely influencing them," St. Romain said of her family members. "But my dad is definitely still pro-Biden. And I don't really argue with him."
If Biden, 76, is going to win the Democratic nomination, it is likely to be because of the support of older Black voters, a key constituency for the party and one that polls show is overwhelmingly supportive of the former vice president's candidacy.
But if he is to be overtaken by one of his more progressive rivals, the most powerful tool against him may not be opposition research or negative advertisements. Instead, it may be an organic effort by younger Black voters - concerned about Biden's age and more moderate ideology - to sway their older family members.
Biden seems aware of this dynamic. In interviews, he has both acknowledged the generational gap among his Black supporters and downplayed its importance, arguing that the support of older, more moderate Black voters would be enough to give him an electoral advantage.
Still, Biden, by his own admission, would be unwise to underestimate the lobbying efforts of those who are young and politically engaged. At a gathering of the New Hampshire Young Democrats in July, Biden said the same phenomenon - young people converting their skeptical parents - had helped fuel his own ascension in politics almost 47 years ago, when he was elected to the Senate as a fresh-faced 29-year-old.
"The fact of the matter is, you have more influence on how your parents vote than they have on you," Biden said in July. "You may sit at the dining room table, having dinner with your mom and dad, and say, 'I met her and I really like her,' or 'I met him and I really like him.' And your parents will pretend it didn't matter much. But they'll go up, not a joke, they'll go up and say, 'If my kid liked that person that much, and knew them, there must be something there.'"
At Texas Southern University, a historically Black university founded in 1927 and the site of last week's Democratic debate, dozens of students, ages 19 to 23, differed on their top candidate. Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and Kamala Harris of California were among the favorites, as was one of the two Texans in the race, former representative Beto O'Rourke.
For Biden, though, students carried mixed feelings. They respected his tenure as Barack Obama's vice president, but implicitly rejected his campaign's central premise, that the primary goal of Democrats in the 2020 election should be defeating President Donald Trump.
They pointed to systemic problems they said the country must address, such as inequality, climate change and gun violence. The Democratic nominee, they said, should embrace progressive proposals like canceling student loan debt, the Green New Deal and gun buyback programs.
"Me and my dad have the debate all the time," said Samantha Williams, 19, a sophomore. "We want a candidate that reflects us and what the world is going to look like when we run. But he says what we call 'woke' is really just sensitive."
The difference in opinion across generations speaks to the changing politics of Black communities, said Rashad Robinson, the president of Color of Change, the racial justice organization. And the historically diverse Democratic field has given voters plentiful options to choose from: multiple Black candidates, white progressives who openly back once-radical ideas like reparations, and Biden, who served as vice president to the first Black president.
Black voters are overwhelmingly members of the Democratic Party, and polls show they have long regarded Trump as a racist president and individual whom they are desperate to replace. A recent national poll of Democratic primary voters from NBC and The Wall Street Journal showed Biden had the support of nearly 50% with Black respondents, though others have shown a less commanding lead.
"Black people are strategic voters, particularly older Black people," Robinson said. "They're thinking harm reduction. They're doing a deep analysis about what they think white people will accept and won't accept."
He pointed to the last Democratic primary, when younger Black voters tracked more toward Sanders than their older counterparts, who overwhelmingly backed Hillary Clinton. In 2008, younger Black voters supported Barack Obama in much bigger numbers than the electorate at large, until his victory in the Iowa Caucus led to a surge of support.
"Young people are constantly signaling what's next and what's possible," Robinson said. "And while there's some love for Biden, but sometimes you're in a relationship because you're comfortable and it's what you know."
It also comes back to Obama, and the long shadow he casts over national Democratic politics, particularly in Black communities. Older Black voters invoke his name in deference, and cite his embrace of Biden as something that helped him win the trust of skeptical white voters in 2008.
To younger generations, many of whom were in high school or younger at the time, Obama's achievements exist on their own. Their first memories of Biden stem from his highly meme-able vice-presidential years. They are also more likely to hold his long and at times controversial record - on criminal justice, school segregation and the Clarence Thomas hearings, among other things - against him.
Jayla Lee, 19, said older Black voters "like Biden because he was with Obama, and they feel like since they could trust Obama that means they can trust him."
"But the things we endure are not the things they endured," Lee said. "And I'm looking for someone who can change the things that affect me."
Darren Black, 22, said older generations were always "going to ride" for Biden, because "Joe was there with Obama."
"But the younger generation, we've seen mass shootings, we're seeing more police brutality - we're looking at different things," Black said.
Yet contrary to their stereotype as idealistic and apathetic, and with the steely pessimism of seasoned political operatives, younger voters expressed a clear-eyed understanding that their efforts to lobby their relatives would not necessarily be successful.
Asked if she'd had any luck converting her family to more progressive candidates, Williams, a political science major, said, "I'm making no progress. None. Not even a tiny bit. I wish."
Williams called her pro-Biden father a lost cause. "We're both opinionated and headstrong people, and I just don't have the energy to go back and forth," she said.
Smith, a member of the school's College Democrats, said he liked Biden, but preferred his more left-wing rivals, such as O'Rourke, Castro, Harris or Warren.
After the debate, he thought about further pestering his grandmother over her support for Biden, but he reconsidered out of fear of coming off as pushy.
"You know, it's grandma, so you got to let her have it," Smith said.
When reached by phone, however, Smith's grandmother, Alice Varnado, said his previous lobbying efforts had been more successful than he may have realized.
Varnado, 69, said she still preferred Biden, but that she had grown concerned about his age in recent months. She said she would vote for whichever Democrat earned the nomination, but she now considers Warren her second choice.
Her family members - Smith and his uncle - had convinced her.
"You know, since talking with my grandson and my son, I think I can go with her," Varnado said. "I'm starting to like her. There's been a turning point."

Texto completo: NUEVA YORK – Los tatuajes faciales del rapero Tekashi 6ix9ine, quien testificó la semana pasada contra antiguos socios de la pandilla Nine Trey Bloods en el juicio en la corte federal de Manhattan, le podrían complicar aún más la vida.
Así se desprende de un análisis del New York Times este martes sobre las posibilidades de que el artista ingrese al programa de protección de testigos del Servicio de Alguaciles Federales.
Por un lado, hay quienes plantean que si el joven, cuyo nombre de pila es Daniel Hernández, desaparece de Nueva York, pocos lo identificarían, pues no es tan conocido en el ambiente de la música urbana.
Así lo indicó el exoficial del FBI, Jay Kramer, quien considera que el exponente de origen boricua mexicano podría encontrar el anonimato .
“A pesar de lo conectados que estamos y el apetito por el contenido de las redes sociales en este país, hay lugares donde, si este niño se corta el pelo y usa ropa normal, nadie sabría ni se preocuparía por quién es “, sostuvo Kramer.
Sin embargo, para otros, los meros diseños que marcan el rostro de T ekashi 6ix9ine no lo harían pasar desapercibido en ningún lugar. Plantean, además, que muy poco en el historial de Tekashi 6ix9ine apunta a la discreción. De hecho, es conocido que el exponente de música urbana es muy vocal en redes sociales donde incluso se identifica como un “troll” (acosador y provocador).
Tekashi 6ix9ine acordó colaborar con la fiscalía para librarse de una condena de 47 años de cárcel por cargos de extorsión , posesión de armas de fuego, tráfico de drogas y conspiración para cometer un asesinato.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – La Casa Blanca prevé entregar al Congreso de Estados Unidos una copia de la queja interna sobre la llamada del presidente Donald Trump con su homólogo ucraniano, Vladimir Zelensky, que ha provocado el inicio de un proceso de “impeachment”, según medios.
El Gobierno se había negado hasta ahora a dar este paso, pero según The New York Times y Politico, tras el inicio formal del proceso de juicio político la Casa Blanca cambió su estrategia.
De acuerdo a los planes descritos por fuentes conocedoras de la cuestión, se hará entrega de la copia de la queja a finales de semana, junto al informe que elaboró el receptor de la filtración: el inspector general de la Comunidad de Inteligencia, Michael Atkinson.
El rotativo neoyorquino, además, también indicó que el Gobierno sopesa permitir que el filtrador, cuya identidad no se ha revelado, pueda reunirse con los investigadores del Congreso.
Estos movimientos son una muestra de la seriedad con la que la Casa Blanca ha recibido el inicio de la investigación sobre un juicio político contra Trump.
Está previsto también que este miércoles la Casa Blanca divulgue la transcripción de la llamada que mantuvieron Trump y Zelensky el pasado 25 de julio, origen de todo este terremoto político.
En esa llamada, el presidente estadounidense pidió a Zelensky que investigase al exvicepresidente Joe Biden y a su hijo Hunter por supuestos actos de corrupción en Ucrania.
Además, Trump supuestamente bloqueó cerca de 400 millones de dólares en ayuda militar para Ucrania con tal de coaccionar a su Gobierno para que abriese esa investigación, unos fondos que finalmente transfirieron el pasado 11 de septiembre.
La presidenta de la Cámara Baja de Estados Unidos, la demócrata Nancy Pelosi, anunció este martes que abrirá una investigación de juicio político contra Trump por haber “traicionado” la seguridad nacional y la Constitución.
Trump consideró esa decisión como una “basura” y una “caza de brujas”.
Más tarde, la Casa Blanca emitió un comunicado en el que afirmó que “lejos del trabajo y los resultados de este presidente, los demócratas de la Cámara de Representantes han destruido cualquier posibilidad de avance legislativo para el pueblo al seguir centrando toda su energía en ataques políticos partidistas”.
“Sus ataques contra el presidente y su agenda no solo son partidistas y patéticos, sino que incumplen su deber constitucional”, añadió el comunicado.
------------
* Nancy Pelosi anuncia oficialmente la investigación para un juicio político contra Trump

Texto completo: In the Trump era, a columnist risks appearing like the boy (or girl) who cried wolf. Time and time again, we say this scandal is the big one.
But in our ill-fated version of the story, the wolf comes every time. The violations of morality and law have become progressively bolder and more dangerous to the constitutional order. And they have culminated in an abuse of power both highly serious and totally unconcealed.
By his own admission, the president of the United States urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to open a criminal investigation of the son of a political rival. Trump denies that this request involved a quid pro quo. But with Ukraine engaged in conflict with Russian-backed separatists, and with $250 million in American military aid being held up (at the time) for "review," the threat did not need to be explicit in order to be palpable and powerful.
This groundbreaking form of political corruption shocked everyone with a conscience who was privy to it. U.S. embassy staff in Kiev expressed alarm about Rudy Giuliani’s contacts with Ukrainian officials. A whistleblower in the intelligence community risked his or her career to report it. The intelligence community’s inspector general found the matter of "urgent concern." But acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire and the Department of Justice — playing the role of political enforcers — have blocked the transmission of the whistleblower’s report to Congress. They are pursuing a cover-up in plain sight.
Here we need to be clear. Treating the presidency in this fashion is not only corrupt but unpatriotic. Trump has set his own interests above the interests of the nation. The American criminal justice system was created to deal with normal types of political corruption, not with a rogue president, testing the limits of executive power. That form of warped ambition must be checked and balanced by the coequal branches of government. But many members of Congress — mostly Republicans but also some Democrats — appear to have lost their taste for that role.
The political risk to elected Republicans when they oppose Trump appears very real. But the moral hazard is far greater. When they use their office to shield shady political dealings, they become a party to public corruption. When they ignore or excuse Trump’s use of the nation’s power and influence for private reasons, they have chosen Trump above their country. Worst of all, they are teaching their political supporters that the rule of law is a small and expendable thing.
In the scarier regions of the Trump right, the problem is far advanced. Every revelation of the president’s abuse of power is met with a sentence beginning: "But Biden ..." Their tolerance for corruption seems limitless — and frightening. By what firm political principle would they condemn Trump if he closed down The New York Times (an "enemy of the people") or arrested a few whistleblowers (part of the "deep state" that is conducting a "coup")?
None of this seems possible. But too many impossibilities have recently become realities. Opposing Trump’s corrupt abuse of power — here, now, before it goes further — is the calling of patriotism in our time.

Texto completo: Once upon a time, there was an ideal. It was called the United States of America.
And in 2016, the presidency of the United States was captured by the flamboyantly incompetent star of a TV reality show, a man who doesn't believe in any ideal beyond his own enrichment and aggrandizement. Some shaken observers assured us that everything would yet be all right. The institutions of democracy - the courts, the Congress, the news media and the agencies of the federal government - would save America from the worst consequences of one of its worst decisions.
"The Guardrails Hold," exulted the headline of a piece by the late conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer. He was highlighting acts of resistance to Donald Trump's bizarre excesses by entities as varied as the Boy Scouts of America and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
That was in August 2017. It has since become painfully clear Mr. Krauthammer exulted too soon. The vaunted institutions of democracy have proven largely unequal to the task of checking Mr. Trump's transgressions.
The courts? The record is mixed; Mr. Trump's bid to rig the census was rejected, his Muslim ban was not.
The Congress? A hotbed of spinelessness that has given Mr. Trump less trouble than the Washington Generals give the Harlem Globetrotters.
The news media? Aggressive reporting is met with widespread apathy and partisan claims of "fake news." The New York Times reported that Mr. Trump committed "outright fraud" as a businessman. Nobody cared.
Which brings us to federal agencies and last week's news that the acting director of national intelligence is apparently shielding Mr. Trump from questioning over allegations of misconduct. It seems Mr. Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden, "about eight times" in a July phone call, according to The Wall Street Journal. House Democrats are looking into whether military aid was withheld from Ukraine in connection with the request.
Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson found the complaint credible and designated it a matter of "urgent concern." That's a legal finding requiring notification of congressional oversight committees. But acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire initially refused to provide that information to lawmakers. He has since agreed to testify before Congress about the complaint on Thursday.
It's important to note the context here.
Earlier this month, the Justice Department launched an antitrust investigation of four automakers after they reached agreement with the state of California to maintain higher fuel-efficiency standards than the federal government requires. It can be no coincidence that Mr. Trump has long been at war with that state. At roughly the same time, officials at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration were reportedly threatened with termination for contradicting Mr. Trump's claim - he tried to prove it by marking a map with a Sharpie - that Alabama was menaced by a killer storm.
Now here's the acting DNI throwing his body between Mr. Trump and accountability. We are seeing the credibility of the federal government mangled in service to this guy's fragile ego. How weak the guardrails of democracy turn out to be. Even this one - a government of, by and for the people - is looking suspiciously like a government of, by and for Mr. Trump.
But where guardrails fail, things crash and fall apart. Something to remember as we wait out the long years until next November.
We were told our institutions would save us. They'll be lucky if they can save themselves.

Netanyahu losing his grip on power

Texto completo: The Israel elections have ended in an effective stalemate that means, in one way or another, the virtual end of Benjamin Netanyahu's grip on power. It's an event likely to reverberate far beyond Israel.
Prime Minister Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party secured 31 seats in the Knesset, while the centrist Blue and White Party, led by Benny Gantz, has 33. That means the next government will be decided by coalition-making; so far, neither party has the 61-seat majority needed to form a government. In a historic first, the bloc of Arab lawmakers, which has never entered parliamentary alliances before, has endorsed Gantz. Netanyahu has the backing of religious parties. The eight-seat Beitenu faction, a secular nationalist party headed by former Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman, is not joining either coalition so far, since Lieberman has issues both with Netanyahu's ultra-Orthodox backers and with Gantz's Arab backers.
Gantz is no kumbaya-singing liberal. He's a former Israeli Defense Force chief of staff who led Israel's 50-day military operation against Hamas militants in Gaza five years ago - which is why it's all the more remarkable that he's been able to win the Arab legislators' support.
Unlike the Arab faction, Gantz does not call for repeal of the controversial 2018 nation-state law which affirmed that "national self-determination in the State of Israel is unique to the Jewish people"  and downgraded Arabic from its status as a second official language. But he has said that he would "fix" the law, and his party platform calls for ensuring that "the value of equality is enshrined" in national legislation. Blue and White also wants to limit the power of the Orthodox rabbinate and resume peace negotiations with the Palestinian Authority.
Netanyahu, who has been in power for a decade, is increasingly under fire from strong supporters of Israel in the American media. Earlier this year, Bloomberg View columnist Eli Lake lambasted him for making a deal with ultranationalist parties he called "Judeofascists" in order to stay in power. And a week ago, New York Times opinion writer Bari Weiss ripped into Netanyahu in an appearance at New York's 92nd Street Y to promote her new book, "How to Fight Anti-Semitism." 
To a question from the audience, "Is Netanyahu a racist?," Weiss responded, "Frankly, yes!"
She listed racist things Netanyahu has said and done, from whipping up fears of Arab voting before elections to allying himself with "vile" ultranationalist groups. While Weiss stressed that blaming Israeli policies for anti-Semitism is inexcusable, she also said, "Netanyahu makes it harder to defend Israel." Weiss' book also lambastes Netanyahu for his alliances with right-wing populist leaders in Europe, such as Hungary's Viktor Orbán, whose flirtations with anti-Semitism he has been willing to overlook in exchange for these leaders' pro-Israel stance. 
Orbán's vision of illiberal democracy, in which majority rule takes precedence over individual rights and freedoms, is very much in line with Netanyahu's outlook. While Israel remains the freest country in the Middle East, Netanyahu has taken it in a more authoritarian, less open and tolerant direction - a tendency has that mirrored the populist drift in Europe and the United States. (His close relationship with Donald Trump is no accident.)
Whether he is forced to leave office or agree to share power in a unity government, it seems clear that Netanyahu's hold on leadership is virtually over  - especially with the added cloud of pending corruption charges. While Israel's politics are unique, the country's turn may yet signal the reversal of nationalist and populist trends in the West.

Texto completo: Fresh off a debate in which he emphasized his support for a mandatory gun-buyback program of assault-style rifles, Democratic presidential contender Beto O'Rourke will campaign this week in Pittsburgh and Erie - where gun violence will be a topic of discussion.
Mr. O'Rourke will "continue to urge decisive action on gun violence" in a scheduled swing through Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and Pennsylvania, according to a release from his campaign.
In Pittsburgh, the former Texas congressman is slated to hold a roundtable discussion Wednesday with the SEIU at the Pitt Student Union, where the doors will open at 11 a.m., followed by a town hall meeting at Schenley Plaza at 11:30 a.m. A town hall meeting in Erie on Thursday will at Lavery Brewery, where the doors open at noon.
Of 19 candidates left in the Democratic field, Mr. O'Rourke has been one of the most vocal advocates for gun control measures, and - after a shooting in his hometown of El Paso in August that killed 22 people - said at the most recent Democratic debate, "Hell, yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47."
"We're not going to allow it to be used against our fellow Americans anymore," he said during the debate Sept. 12.
Mr. O'Rourke will be the second candidate in as many weeks to visit the region, as Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar stopped here last week on her self-proclaimed "blue wall" tour of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.

Texto completo: ImageNet Roulette, a digital art project and viral selfie app, exposes how biases have crept into the artificial-intelligence technologies changing our lives.
When Tabong Kima checked his Twitter feed early Wednesday morning, the hashtag of the moment was #ImageNetRoulette.
Everyone, it seemed, was uploading selfies to a website where some sort of artificial intelligence analyzed each face and described what it saw. The site, ImageNet Roulette, pegged one man as an "orphan." Another was a "nonsmoker." A third, wearing glasses, was a "swot, grind, nerd, wonk, dweeb."
Across Mr. Kima's Twitter feed, these labels -- some accurate, some strange, some wildly off base -- were played for laughs. So he joined in. But Mr. Kima, a 24-year-old African-American, did not like what he saw. When he uploaded his own smiling photo, the site tagged him as a "wrongdoer" and an "offender."
"I might have a bad sense of humor," he tweeted, "but I don't think this is particularly funny."
As it turned out, his response was just what the site was aiming for. ImageNet Roulette is a digital art project intended to shine a light on the quirky, unsound and offensive behavior that can creep into the artificial-intelligence technologies that are rapidly changing our everyday lives, including the facial recognition services used by internet companies, police departments and other government agencies.
Facial recognition and other A.I. technologies learn their skills by analyzing vast amounts of digital data. Drawn from old websites and academic projects, this data often contains subtle biases and other flaws that have gone unnoticed for years. ImageNet Roulette, designed by the American artist Trevor Paglen and a Microsoft researcher named Kate Crawford, aims to show the depth of this problem.
"We want to show how layers of bias and racism and misogyny move from one system to the next," Mr. Paglen said in a phone interview from Paris. "The point is to let people see the work that is being done behind the scenes, to see how we are being processed and categorized all the time."
Unveiled this week as part of an exhibition at the Fondazione Prada museum in Milan, the site focuses attention on a massive database of photos called ImageNet. First compiled more than a decade ago by a group of researchers at Stanford University, located in Silicon Valley in California, ImageNet played a vital role in the rise of "deep learning," the mathematical technique that allows machines to recognize images, including faces.
Packed with over 14 million photos pulled from all over the internet, ImageNet was a way of training A.I. systems and judging their accuracy. By analyzing various kinds of images -- such as flowers, dogs and cars -- these systems learned to identify them.
What was rarely discussed among communities knowledgeable about A.I. is that ImageNet also contained photos of thousands of people, each sorted into their own categories. This included straightforward tags like "cheerleaders," "welders" and "Boy Scouts" as well as highly charged labels like "failure, loser, non-starter, unsuccessful person" and "slattern, slut, slovenly woman, trollop."
By creating a project that applies such labels, whether seemingly innocuous or not, Mr. Paglen and Ms. Crawford are showing how opinion, bias and sometimes offensive points of view can drive the creation of artificial intelligence.
The ImageNet labels were applied by thousands of unknown people, most likely in the United States, hired by the team from Stanford. Working through the crowdsourcing service Amazon Mechanical Turk, they earned pennies for each photo they labeled, churning through hundreds of tags an hour. As they did, biases were baked into the database, though it's impossible to know whether these biases were held by those doing the labeling.
They defined what a "loser" looked like. And a "slut." And a "wrongdoer."
The labels originally came from another sprawling collection of data called WordNet, a kind of conceptual dictionary for machines built by researchers at Princeton University in the 1980s. But with these inflammatory labels included, the Stanford researchers may not have realized what they were doing.
Artificial intelligence is often trained on vast data sets that even its creators haven't quite wrapped their heads around. "This is happening all the time at a very large scale -- and there are consequences," said Liz O'Sullivan, who oversaw data labeling at the artificial intelligence start-up Clarifai and is now part of a civil rights and privacy group called the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project that aims to raise awareness of the problems with A.I. systems.
Many of the labels used in the ImageNet data set were extreme. But the same problems can creep into labels that might seem inoffensive. After all, what defines a "man" or a "woman" is open to debate.
"When labeling photos of women or girls, people may not include nonbinary people or women with short hair," Ms. O'Sullivan said. "Then you end up with an A.I. model that only includes women with long hair."
In recent months, researchers have shown that face-recognition services from companies like Amazon, Microsoft and IBM can be biased against women and people of color. With this project, Mr. Paglen and Ms. Crawford hoped to bring more attention to the problem -- and they did. At one point this week, as the project went viral on services like Twitter, ImageNet Roulette was generating more than 100,000 labels an hour.
"It was a complete surprise to us that it took off in the way that it did," Ms. Crawford said, while with Mr. Paglen in Paris. "It let us really see what people think of this and really engage with them."
For some, it was a joke. But others, like Mr. Kima, got the message. "They do a pretty good job of showing what the problem is -- not that I wasn't aware of the problem before," he said.
Still, Mr. Paglen and Ms. Crawford believe the problem may be even deeper than people realize.
ImageNet is just one of the many data sets that has been widely used and reused by tech giants, start-ups and academic labs as they trained various forms of artificial intelligence. Any flaws in these data sets have already spread far and wide.
Nowadays, many companies and researchers are working to eliminate these flaws. In response to complaints of bias, Microsoft and IBM have updated their face-recognition services. In January, around the time that Mr. Paglen and Ms. Crawford first discussed the strange labels used in ImageNet, Stanford researchers blocked the download of all faces from the data set. They now say they will delete many of the faces.
Their longstanding aim is to "address issues like data set and algorithm fairness, accountability and transparency," the Stanford team said in a statement shared with The New York Times.
But for Mr. Paglen, a larger issue looms. The fundamental truth is that A.I. learns from humans -- and humans are biased creatures. "The way we classify images is a product of our worldview," he said. "Any kind of classification system is always going to reflect the values of the person doing the classifying."

More Minnesota students are getting extra time to take tests — especially in wealthy school districts

Texto completo: The rate at which Minnesota students receive accommodations for conditions like ADHD, anxiety, depression and others has increased by about ten-fold in two decades, according to data from the Minnesota Department of Education.
In 2000, about 2 out of every 1,000 students enrolled in Minnesota public schools had “504 plans,” which provide for things things like extra time on tests or extended deadlines on assignments. In 2019, that number was 16 out of every 1,000 students, a MinnPost analysis of MDE data shows.
But the data also show 504 plans aren’t up everywhere: they’re most prevalent in some of Minnesota’s wealthier school districts.
Section 504
504 plans are named after a section of federal law — Section 504 of the 1973 federal Rehabilitation Act — which prohibits discrimination against students based on a disability in school districts that receive federal funding. The law doesn’t define disability strictly, instead focusing on its effects.
“The criteria in the law is that it has to be a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity,” said Daron Korte, assistant Minnesota Department of Education Commissioner overseeing special education, compliance and assistance, rulemaking, and health, nutrition and youth development.
Common conditions for which students receive 504s include ADHD, depression, traumatic brain injury, broken limbs and heart defects. Generally, Korte said, it’s disabilities that don’t rise to the level of meeting a disability criteria under IDEA, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, for which a student would typically receive special education services under an individualized education plan, or IEP (though students may have services under both plans).
Unlike IEPs, which might require specialized instruction, “504 plans are accommodation-only. They’re not modification and that’s an important difference. An accommodation is anything that doesn’t change the rigor or the standard,” said Christine Peper, mentor manager and faculty member at the Learning Disabilities Association of Minnesota.
Also worth noting, said Korte, is that 504 plans may be underreported because, unlike IEP plans, they’re not attached to federal funding, so there’s no monetary incentive for districts to accurately report data.
Plan initiation
There isn’t one protocol for initiating 504 plans: sometimes it’s the district that starts the process, when teachers notice a student is struggling and look into accommodations. But often it’s parents, who are concerned their kid is having trouble in school and hope to find a way to help.
Parents can request districts do an assessment for a 504 plan. In an assessment, districts typically look into grades, class performance and test scores to see if there’s a pattern where the student is struggling that might merit accommodations.
504 plans don’t require a medical diagnosis, but medical evaluations are often used to determine whether students should have 504 accommodations and what types of accommodations might be applicable.
Accommodations vary by school and condition: a student with ADHD might be given extra time on tests. A student whose mobility makes it harder to get to class on time might get more passing time in the hallway. A student with depression might get extended assignment deadlines.
Behind the numbers
There are a few reasons experts say the number of 504s in Minnesota are up.
A 2008 amendment to the Americans With Disabilities Act expanded the scope of 504 eligibility, more broadly defining what qualifies as a disability under the law.
But the numbers started to rise before that change was made, something some see as a result of growing awareness and communication about conditions that hinder students’ academic progress — particularly mental health diagnoses, and the resources available to students.
504 plans per 1,000 students in Minnesota Public Schools
“I think there definitely is more awareness, especially of ADHD, said Julie McMonagle, a social worker at Gillette Children’s Specialty Healthcare. These days, McMonagle works most often with students who receive accommodations for physical conditions, ranging from cerebral palsy to orthopedic conditions and epilepsy.
But, she said, “when I was in the schools, (ADHD) was our most common 504, and I think there definitely has been an increase in that diagnosis and then the awareness that accommodations are available and needed for that diagnosis,” she said.
Mary Beth Kelley, program manager and developer at the Learning Disabilities Association of Minnesota, said heightened anxiety in school environments could be causing more underlying conditions, too.
“I was in a school yesterday where we had a lockdown drill. To be honest, the intruder lockdown drill created a lot of anxiety — the fact that we even have to do those in schools and the reality that there might be a shooting makes kids very anxious,” she said.
With increasing use of parent websites and forums online, it’s easier for parents who are concerned about their kids to access advice, too. “Parents have become more educated about what is out there to help their child. There has also been the emergence of various parent advocacy groups that put stuff on the Internet that parents can follow,” said Michael Zaccariello, a psychologist at the Mayo Clinic.
Disparities in 504s
But the increase in awareness hasn’t happened everywhere, and disparities in 504 plan rates exist at both the state and national level.
The three Minnesota school districts with the highest share of students with 504 plans are some of the state’s wealthiest, on average: First is Mahtomedi, where about 6 percent of students have 504 plans, and next are Orono and Minnetonka, where 5 percent have 504 plans. MDE data show that less than 10 percent of students in those districts qualify for free or reduced-priced lunch, a measure used as a proxy for poverty. (A spokesperson for Mahtomedi Public Schools said an increase in 504s is partly due to more broadly-defined disabilities under the revised ADA.)
In Minneapolis, where 60 percent of students qualify for free or reduced-price lunch, about 3 percent students of had 504s, according to state data.
88 percent of Minnesota students who have 504 plans are white, compared to 66 percent of students who are enrolled in Minnesota public schools.
A New York Times investigation found that nationally, students in wealthier school districts were more likely to have 504 plans than students in poorer districts. The investigation followed the accusation that William Singer, a consultant at the center of the college admissions scandal in which students from wealthy families were accused of gaming the system to get into college, was using 504 designations as a way to help students get extra test-taking time.
Because 504 plans are often found at higher concentrations in richer districts, they’re sometimes criticized as being misused to give students who are already at an advantage an even greater edge on things like standardized tests that can determine college and job placement in their futures.
The Times talked to high school counselors in affluent districts who said some parents would pay up to $10,000 for evaluations that weren’t covered by insurance, a phenomenon the counselors called “diagnosis shopping.”
But more than that, the Times found disparities in access across districts. “What we found was less a story of fraud than one of everyday inequality. Although some unknown number of 504 disability cases are likely misdiagnoses of students whose parents are particularly aggressive or anxious about academic competition, the majority of these wealth-related disparities are due to unequal access to psychological services,” their report found.
Kelley said in addition to disparities in access, there’s disparities in knowledge that the plans even exist at all.
“It’s hit or miss. There are some schools where I think they know about the resources and know how to access the resources, and there are other places that don’t seem to know,” she said.

Is a new car always the best? Think again

Texto completo: From the first month of ownership, you'd owe more on your car than it's worth. Four years later, you'd still have a year or two of payments left, but your car would've lost most of its value.
Car payments are so prevalent in society today that people think they're a normal part of life. But if you took the average car payment of $545 and invested it into a Roth IRA instead, 30 years later you'd be sitting on a cool $1.4million.
Look, I like my car too – but not that much!
For me, that's motivation enough to save up and pay cash for a car instead of financing one. But I get plenty of objections to this way of thinking.
Here are some of the excuses I hear. And the truth about them:
'But the 0% interest rate is a great deal!' No, it's not. That new car starts losing value the instant you drive it off the lot.
From the first month of ownership, you'd owe more on your car than it's worth. Four years later, you'd still have a year or two of payments left, but your car would've lost most of its value.
And let's not forget that 0% is not the same as cash, and not everyone who falls for the 0% marketing pitch actually qualifies for the deal. But by then, you're already in love with the car of your dreams and are willing to sign anything to drive it home. And of course, some of those "deals" aren't quite as attractive once you read the fine print.
Making money off car loans is their business. You're not outsmarting anyone!
'I just had a baby, so I need a "safe" car. . . like a new Tahoe.' This is one I hear all the time from people I know who have kids – especially new parents. Do babies take up more room? Yes. Do you want your baby to be safe in the car? Yes! But those things don't equal a new SUV. Safe does not equal new.
There are plenty of safe, preowned cars out there. And you shouldn't let your desire to keep up with the Joneses drive your money habits and decisions. The Joneses are broke. Keeping up with broke people who are just trying to look rich is a really bad plan.
'How am I supposed to buy a car without a car loan?' Save up and pay cash for your cars. Yep, I mean it!
All it takes is making the decision to pay yourself instead of the bank. If you have a car loan, go crazy and pay it off quickly. Or, sell it to get the process rolling to pay yourself instead of the bank.
The first car you buy with cash might not be your dream car, but that's okay. Just because it's not your dream car doesn't mean it has to be a junker. Pick out a car with a body style that doesn't change often. I can't tell you how many luxury-brand cars I see on the road, and yet have no idea what year they were made.

Texto completo: What's on TV
THE VOICE 8 p.m. on NBC. The singing competition returns for its 17th season with Taylor Swift set to reprise her role as "mega mentor" to the contestants who make it to the show's Knockout Rounds. She appeared previously on "The Voice" in this capacity in 2014. Swift will dispense her wisdom to those singers who are chosen by Kelly Clarkson, John Legend, Blake Shelton and returning judge and coach Gwen Stefani. In the season premiere, the contestants will endure blind auditions, in which the four judges will begin each performance facing away from the stage, only seeing the person they're listening to if they choose to serve as their coach. Through this process, each of the judges will accrue a team of contestants they'll then shepherd through to the next stage of the competition.
What's Streaming
MYSTIC RIVER (2003) Stream on Netflix. Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. Clint Eastwood's mystery film follows three estranged childhood friends, Jimmy, Sean and Dave, who are brought back together by the murder of Jimmy's daughter Katie (Emmy Rossum). Dave (Tim Robbins) saw Katie the night she was killed and returned to his wife, later that evening, covered in blood. Sean (Kevin Bacon), now a detective, is charged with finding the perpetrator. But Jimmy (Sean Penn), who has criminal connections, insists on conducting his own vigilante investigation. The events of the present are shadowed throughout the film by the brutal sexual abuse Dave experienced at the hands of two men who abducted him from a childhood street hockey game. Eventually that past crime rears its ugly head with tragic consequences.
SECRETARY (2002) Stream on Hulu. Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. Viewers will have to decide how well the sexual politics of this unconventional romantic comedy have aged since the turn of the millennium. Maggie Gyllenhaal plays Lee, a troubled young woman who finds work as a secretary to a temperamental attorney, E. Edward Grey (James Spader). His demanding personality and her obedient one gel and their dynamic quickly becomes sexual. In his review for The New York Times, Stephen Holden called the film "a small groundbreaking comedy" and said that its characterization of Lee isn't derisive. "Lee may be shown crawling around the floor with an envelope in her teeth, but the movie still insists on seeing her as a plucky heroine plotting her own sexual emancipation."
OCÉANS (2010) Stream on Netflix. Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. This documentary by Jacques Perrin and Jacques Cluzaud explores the Earth's largest bodies of water, which cover around 70 percent of the planet's surface and contain roughly 97 percent of its liquid H2O. The film, narrated in English by Pierce Brosnan, approaches its gargantuan subject in several ways, showcasing its role as a home to many different ecosystems that each support a variety of plant and animal species. It also takes a wider look at the relationship between our oceans and the larger global environment as well as the ways in which humans interact with this major feature of their world.

Times bias was plain to see in Kavanaugh story

Texto completo: The New York Times fell for a bit of confirmation bias in allegations of sexual assault last weekend against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh in his Yale days.
The newspaper's hostility to President Trump is well known, and its disdain for Kavanaugh or any other conservatives in the federal judiciary is no surprise. Its eagerness to ignore common rules of fairness in order to smear the justice, though, was startling.
Two Times reporters have a new book about Kavanaugh, containing lurid new allegations of drunken sexual harassment at some parties during his Yale years. The authors also did a story based on their book last Sunday. The story left out a couple things – like how the woman involved in one incident told friends she had no memory of it and how a man at the party, who went to the FBI with the accusation, had worked for the law firm representing Bill Clinton while Kavanaugh worked for the special counsel trying to impeach Clinton.
Those are details that definitely belong in the story. Once called out on social media, the Times appended an "Editor's Note" – not a correction – adding the information.
The reporters, Kate Kelly and Robin Pogrebin, later said their news story included the fact that the woman refused an interview and her friends said she didn't remember the incident, but it got taken out by the copy desk. If so, that's worse than confirmation bias – that's malice.
The Times failed to report, at best, or deliberately withheld, at worst, information questioning the premise that Kavanaugh did grossly obscene things.
Trump, who said during his 2016 campaign he'd like to "open up some of these libel laws" that make it hard for public officials to win damages for defamation, tweeted that Kavanaugh should sue the Times. He won't, of course, but the paper's deliberate deletion of information that calls into question the premise of an article would probably be Exhibit A if he did.
Naturally, some Democratic presidential contenders immediately called for his impeachment. That's not going to happen, either, but calling for it got them a little TV attention.
Media response to the Times gaffe was interesting, though predictable. Remember how the national media lost its collective mind over Trump making a pen change on a map to include Alabama in Hurricane Dorian's path? They went on about it for more than a week.
But the nation's largest and most influential newspaper, the one that sets the pace for most of the news networks, leaves out exculpatory information in a story smearing a Supreme Court justice? Oops, here's a little editor's note. No harm, no foul, move on.
You'd like to think something like this, something so intentional and obvious, would make top editors of the Times do an internal examination and find out how it could happen. But all the news media are much better at speculating and imputing motives to others than looking at our own biases and motives.
Two other women, Mollie Hemingway and Carrie Severino, recently published a book, "Justice on Trial: The Kavanaugh Confirmation and the Future of the Supreme Court." I've been invited to moderate a discussion with the authors Thursday at Capital Tiger Bay Club.
I started their book a while ago and need to finish this weekend. I haven't seen the Times reporters' book yet, but Hemingway and Severino have written a very detailed and informative history of how confirmation of justices has turned into an ugly expensive, clash between interest groups.
Broadly applied, it's called "Borking," for the way liberals used any means necessary to stop President Reagan's nomination of Judge Robert Bork. We saw it with Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh got it times 10 because his appointment figured to tip the liberal-conservative balance of the court.
Liberal groups started raising millions as soon as Justice Anthony Kennedy retired, and had protest signs with names of the three finalists for his seat, ready to picket the Supreme Court as soon as Trump made his choice.
And the Trump team was also ready, with the advantage of a slim majority in the Senate.
It's a hopelessly naïve thought but, wouldn't it be nice if some things, like the Supreme Court, could be above gutter politics? Or if both sides could argue honestly – and big media took sides only on the editorial pages?

Texto completo: Three men died and four others were hospitalized in Pittsburgh early Sunday morning as a result of overdoses, authorities said.
All of the men were wearing orange paper bands on their wrists and had been at the same event at the same venue, police said. The men left the venue, which officials did not identify, to go to a private residence, where they overdosed on drugs together, police said.
“To be clear, this was not a case of a tainted drug being passed around or distributed in large volume at a large venue which could have affected even more people,” Chris Togneri, a spokesman for the Department of Public Safety, said. “It appears to have been isolated to a single location.”
Officials did not identify the drugs that had led to the overdoses. However, in a statement, police said they were concerned about “a tainted, potentially deadly batch of drugs in the community.”
“We remind the public not to use drugs,” the statement said. “Simply put: You do not know what’s in that drug.”
Authorities had received a report at 3:20 a.m. of a man found on the street who required medical help. Nearly an hour later, a second medical call came about a man in the elevator of an apartment building about two blocks away from where the first man had been found, Togneri said.
At about 5:40 a.m., authorities found five men inside an apartment, two of whom were dead. The man found in the elevator also died, he said.
None of the men were tenants at the apartment in the Southside Works City Club Apartment building, said Mark Winter, a spokesman for the building, adding that the men had been visiting a tenant who was “in good standing.”
“It is also our understanding that the group had attended an outside event before returning to the apartment,” Winter said in a statement. “We are working closely with the local authorities.”
Togneri said police identified multiple venues in the city that had used orange wristbands on Saturday night for events and concerts.
“News reports linking this incident to specific venues are incorrect,” he said. “Anyone who attended one of these events has no cause for concern regarding their health.”
Those who had been hospitalized were in conditions ranging from serious to critical, Wendell Hissrich, the director of public safety, said in a statement.

Jonathan Van Ness of ‘Queer Eye’ comes out as a sexual assault survivor, addict and HIV-positive

Texto completo: New York • Jonathan Van Ness was having a late breakfast at the Empire Diner, around the corner from his one-bedroom apartment in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan.
Seated in a window booth, he was serving what he calls his “16th-century Jesus” look: Hollywood-starlet tresses, a mustache a la a Super Mario villain and fingernails painted with cartoon depictions from the 1996 film “The First Wives Club.”
But Van Ness was not feeling his normal gorgeous self, the boisterous “Yass queen” merman that fans of “Queer Eye” adore. He was hung over.
And no, it wasn’t from partying too much. It was a “vulnerability hangover,” to use a term coined by Brené Brown, a TED Talk-famous researcher, to describe feelings of dread after being forthcoming.
“I’ve had nightmares every night for the past three months because I’m scared to be this vulnerable with people,” Van Ness said.
For much of the summer, Van Ness, 32, has been mentally preparing himself for the release of his piercing memoir, “Over the Top,” on Sept. 26, in which a different image of Van Ness unspools with remarkable transparency.
Subtitled a “Raw Journey to Self-Love,” the book doesn’t so much explode as offer psychological insight into the hirsute gay fairy godmother in heels or, as he puts it, “the effervescent, gregarious majestic center-part-blow-dry cotton-candy figure-skating queen” that he portrays on “Queer Eye.”
“It’s hard for me to be as open as I want to be when there are certain things I haven’t shared publicly,” he said. He cracked his knuckles as he fidgeted from nerves. “These are issues that need to be talked about.”
He ordered another cup of coffee, his fifth of the day, and began tearing up as he spoke about a particularly painful memory, one of many that he divulges in his book. When he was much younger, he was abused by an older boy from church, during what was supposed to be a make-believe play session.
“For a lot of people who are survivors of sexual assault at a young age, we have a lot of compounded trauma,” he said.
Suddenly, a 20-something woman with a ponytail appeared at the table. “I’m so sorry, I can’t take a picture right now,” he said, discreetly wiping his eyes.
“Oh, that’s fine. I just want to say that I love the show,” she said.
“Thank you. Namaste. Have a nice day,” he said, clasping his hands in prayer.
Van Ness exhaled and gently took a sip of coffee. “If you’re having a terrible moment or in the middle of a conversation about something serious, people don’t care,” he said. “They want their bubbly J.V.N. and to get that major selfie.”
Sex, Drugs and Hair
In a sense, the memoir was a way for Van Ness to tell his story without interruption. There are certainly moments that may make some readers pause.
Van Ness grew up in Quincy, Illinois, a small port city along the Mississippi River, where he was a self-described “little baby queen” unafraid to embrace his femininity. It helped to have a mostly supportive family, including a mother he considers a lifelong best friend.
The Van Ness family owns Quincy Media, a media company that operates 16 televisions stations in Illinois, Wisconsin and elsewhere, as well as two local newspapers. His mother, Mary Winters, is the company’s vice president; his father, Jon Van Ness, worked in sales. (They divorced when he was 5, and his mother remarried four years later.)
At Quincy Senior High School (which he visits in the latest season of “Queer Eye”), he leapt over social norms to become the school’s first male cheerleader. Never mind the beer bottles thrown at him during games.
He wasn’t exactly popular, and students spread rumors about his friendship with a closeted boy from his swim class. Van Ness felt humiliated. “I was too fat, too femme, too loud and too unlovable,” he said.
His lack of self-esteem ran deep. As therapy would later reveal, the abuse he experienced as a young child planted the seed for other self-destructive behaviors. In his early teens, he spent hours in AOL chat rooms (this was the 1990s) and met up with older men for sex. One man, he recounts in the book, “turned whiter than Ann Coulter’s fan base” after learning he was underage.
He found other ways to fill the void, including binge eating junk food like doughnuts when his stepfather died (he gained 70 pounds in three months).
Eager to leave Quincy, he earned extra credit to skip senior year and attended the University of Arizona in Tucson. But during his first semester, he blew a monthly allowance of $200 from his mother on cocaine, which he started doing on weekends.
Instead of asking his mother for more money (he was too ashamed and reckless at the time), he advertised sex for money on Gay.com, a chat and personals site.
He flunked out of college his first year — he was 19 — and sulked home with his ponytail between his legs.
Unsure what to do with his life, he decided to take the skills honed from styling the hair of his Barbie dolls to the next level and enrolled in an 11-month beautician program at the Aveda Institute in Minneapolis, where his first clients included many Somali refugees.
After getting his certificate, he moved to Scottsdale, Arizona, (to be near his dying grandmother) and then to Los Angeles, where he supported himself as an assistant at a Sally Hershberger salon.
But his addiction to sex and drugs got worse. When he was in his early 20s, a couple he met on Grindr introduced him to smoking methamphetamine. He went to rehab twice and relapsed both times.
One day, when he was 25, he fainted in a salon while highlighting a client’s hair. The next day he went to Planned Parenthood to diagnose his flulike symptoms. He tested positive for HIV.
“That day was just as devastating as you would think it would be,” he writes.
His Own Makeover
He cleaned up his act; he still drinks and smokes marijuana but says he hasn’t done hard drugs in years. And, using money from a family trust, he started anew in Los Angeles.
Appropriately enough, his foray into entertainment began at the hair salon. During an appointment with his friend Erin Gibson, a comedian who worked for Funny or Die, the two came up with a parody series called “Gay of Thrones,” in which Van Ness and a guest comedian offer campy, gay-themed recaps of “Game of Thrones.”
The show premiered in 2013 and became a hit. (It has been nominated for three Creative Arts Emmys for short-form variety series). Soon, Van Ness was offered roles as a red-carpet commentator and as a host of other web series.
Then, in 2016, his manager called with news that would truly flip his hair: Netflix was holding auditions for a reboot of “Queer Eye.” It took many weeks, but Van Ness eventually won the producers over.
In the show’s four seasons, the “Queer Eye” cast has gone from fringe gay personalities to mainstream celebrities, with Van Ness as one of the series’s breakout stars.
In a recent episode set in Kansas City, Missouri, he confronts the shame associated with traction alopecia, a form of hair loss that predominantly affects black women. It’s a topic rarely discussed on television, especially by someone who is white.
On Twitter, Tressie McMillan Cottom, an author and professor of sociology at Virginia Commonwealth University, wrote: “Jonathan treating this sister with traction alopecia with love is more care than I can recall a regular black woman getting on TV ever.” (When he was shown that tweet, he burst into tears.)
Van Ness hopes to bring attention to what he calls “gorgeous beauty moments” like that with his memoir, especially misperceptions about being HIV positive. He is healthy and describes himself as an out-and-proud “member of the beautiful HIV-positive community.”
“When ‘Queer Eye’ came out, it was really difficult because I was like, ‘Do I want to talk about my status?” he said. “And then I was like, ‘The Trump administration has done everything they can do to have the stigmatization of the LGBT community thrive around me.’” He paused before adding, “I do feel the need to talk about this.”
Just as he about to take a bite of his eggs at the diner, Van Ness was interrupted once again. This time it was a boyish young man who poked his head in the window to profess his admiration.
After another “namaste,” which appears to be his shorthand for “kindly leave,” Van Ness resumed his thoughts. “These are all difficult subjects to talk about on a makeover show about hair and makeup,” he said. “That doesn’t mean ‘Queer Eye’ is less valid, but I want people to realize you’re never too broken to be fixed.”

Texto completo: Washington • Everyone here is keyed up for the Big One.
The One that’s going to finally bring Donald Trump down.
As soon as the news broke Wednesday night in The Washington Post that a whistleblower had accused the president of making some sort of nefarious “promise” during a call to a foreign leader, the hive erupted.
Democrats haven’t been able to get Trump on paying off a porn star to protect his campaign. They haven’t been able to get him on being a Russian agent. They haven’t been able to get him on obstruction of justice.
But maybe this time. Maybe this was the One where all would decide that they wanted impeachment, that the president’s behavior was so outrageous that they couldn’t imagine this sleazy business guy sitting in the Oval Office playing a tinpot dictator in a tinfoil hat for another second.
Maybe this was the One that would finally move Republicans to turn on the Grendel who is terrorizing the village and gulping down their party.
Certainly, Trump himself didn’t think so. As the capital was going into overdrive-freak-out mode Friday night trying to flesh out the whistleblower story, the president was busy tweeting about a children’s book by a Fox News host: “Buy this Book — great for the kids!”
If House Democrats can ever get their paws on the whistleblower, maybe they can make up for the Judiciary Committee’s performance with Corey Lewandowski this past week, which left many wondering if these hearings designed to pry Trump out of office are just making Democrats look foolish. They certainly provide an ample platform for Trump loyalists to rail against their favorite deep state foils.
When failed presidential candidate Eric Swalwell tried to get Lewandowski to read a message Trump had dictated to him, the witness nastily referred to the Democrat as “President Swalwell” and told him to read the message himself.
The internecine strains between the impeach-now Nadler crowd and the get-him-out-in-2020 Pelosi crew grew more bitter. Politico reported that in a closed-door meeting, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi shocked lawmakers and aides by harshly criticizing the House Judiciary Committee staffers for propelling the impeachment effort far beyond where the Democratic caucus stands.
“And you can feel free to leak this,” Pelosi said acidly.
In an interview with NPR, she said she hadn’t changed her mind on impeachment, but she does think Congress should pass new laws so future presidents can be indicted. She said everyone had now seen what the founding fathers could not imagine: a president blatantly abusing the Constitution he has sworn to protect.
Trump has certainly been working hard to prove Pelosi right that presidents should not ever be above the law.
By Friday night, while Trump was readying for a state dinner with his ultraconservative pal from down under, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, The Wall Street Journal and the Times were reporting that the secret whistleblower complaint involved this: Trump repeatedly pressured President Volodymyr Zelenskiy of Ukraine — about eight times, the Journal said — to work with Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s loony personal lawyer, to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden.
Giuliani has been pushing a story about the former vice president and his son, who had ties to a Ukrainian oligarch.
After a fair bit of babbling on Chris Cuomo’s CNN show, Giuliani spit out some truth, that he asked Ukrainians to look into the Bidens. Later he tweeted: “A President telling a Pres-elect of a well known corrupt country he better investigate corruption that affects US is doing his job.”
Crooked Donald thinks he can create a Crooked Joe narrative just like he created a Crooked Hillary one. Which is it, Donald: Crooked or Sleepy?
So just consider this: Around the same time that Trump escaped the noose after Robert Mueller’s tepid testimony, sliding away from charges that he colluded with a foreign country to interfere in our election, he began arm-twisting another foreign country to interfere in our election.
“Questions have emerged,” the Times said, “about whether Mr. Trump’s push for an inquiry into the Bidens was behind a weekslong White House hold on military aid for Ukraine. The United States suspended the military aid to Ukraine in early July, according to a former American official.”
So the president is under suspicion of making like Nixon and abusing power to go after his enemies, saying it would be a shame if anything happened to that military aid that you want because you don’t dig up some dirt on the son of my political rival.
The administration kept the whistleblower’s complaint from Congress, even though Congress has the legal authority to know what this urgent complaint is about.
Pelosi issued an acerbic statement Friday, noting that Joseph Maguire, acting director of national intelligence, was violating the law by refusing to disclose the complaint to Congress.
“If the president has done what has been alleged, then he is stepping into a dangerous minefield with serious repercussions for his administration and our democracy,” she said.
Trump is literally acting like an international mobster. Roy Cohn would be so proud.
So is this the Big One? We don’t know because so much has come before. But if it is? Now that would be big.

Texto completo: Once upon a time, there was an ideal. It was called the United States of America.
And in 2016, the presidency of the United States was captured by the flamboyantly incompetent star of a TV reality show, a man who doesn’t believe in any ideal beyond his own enrichment and aggrandizement. Some shaken observers assured us everything would yet be all right. The institutions of democracy — the courts, the Congress, the news media and the agencies of the federal government — would save America from the worst consequences of one of its worst decisions.
“The Guardrails Hold,” exulted the headline of a piece by the late conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer. He was highlighting acts of resistance to Donald Trump’s bizarre excesses by entities as varied as the Boy Scouts of America and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
That was in August of 2017. It has since become painfully clear Krauthammer exulted too soon. The vaunted institutions of democracy have proven largely unequal to the task of checking Trump’s transgressions.
The courts? The record is mixed; Trump’s bid to rig the Census was rejected, his Muslim ban was not.
The Congress? A hotbed of spinelessness that has given Trump less trouble than the Washington Generals give the Harlem Globetrotters.
The news media? Aggressive reporting is met with widespread apathy and partisan claims of “fake news.” The New York Times reported that Trump committed “outright fraud” as a businessman. Nobody cared.
Which brings us to federal agencies and last week’s news that the acting director of national intelligence is apparently shielding Trump from questioning over allegations of still-unrevealed misconduct. It seems Trump, who has a history of cavalier behavior with classified information — he once blurted intelligence secrets to Russians in the Oval Office — had an interaction with a foreign leader wherein he made an unspecified “promise” that so troubled one official it led to the filing of a formal whistleblower complaint.
As first reported by The Washington Post, Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson found the complaint credible and designated it a matter of “urgent concern.” That’s a legal finding requiring notification of congressional oversight committees. But acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire has refused to provide that information to lawmakers.
It’s important to note the context here.
Earlier this month, the Justice Department launched an antitrust investigation of four automakers after they reached agreement with the state of California to maintain higher fuel-efficiency standards than the federal government requires. It can be no coincidence that Trump has long been at war with that state.
At roughly the same time, officials at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reportedly were threatened with termination for contradicting Trump’s claim — he tried to prove it by marking a map with a Sharpie — that Alabama was menaced by a killer storm.
Now here’s the acting DNI throwing his body between Trump and accountability. We are seeing the credibility of the federal government mangled in service to this guy’s fragile ego. How weak the guardrails of democracy turn out to be. Even this one — a government of, by and for the people is looking suspiciously like a government of, by and for Trump.
But where guardrails fail, things crash and fall apart. Something to remember as we wait out the long years until next November.
We were told our institutions would save us. They’ll be lucky if they can save themselves.

Texto completo: Just as the aftershocks of the special counsel's Russia investigation seemed to have settled, the latest tremblor out of the Oval Office is whether the president used the levers of his foreign policy toward Ukraine for political gain.
A confidential whistleblower report might provide an answer. But once again, the nation's grinding democratic processes are falling short of providing Americans what they need to decide whether Donald Trump did something wrong.
Short of someone violating the law by leaking that whistleblower complaint, or the whistleblower risking retaliation by bravely going to Congress, there's no quick or certain process for the public to learn its contents.
There is, however, a steady drip of news media reports, and a few admissions by Trump himself on Sunday.
According to The Washington Post and The New York Times, a whistleblower complaint filed with the intelligence community's inspector general focused on a promise Trump made during a phone call on July 25 with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. (This happened to be the day after Robert Mueller's much-anticipated congressional testimony. ) During that conversation, Trump asked the Kiev leader to investigate a key political opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden, and Biden's son Hunter, regarding the younger Biden's past business dealings in Ukraine.
The Wall Street Journal later buttressed this reporting, revealing that Trump pressed Zelensky about eight times during their call to open the inquiry.
VIEWS FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP AND OTHERS: 'The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption'
Still unclear is whether there's any connection between Trump's desire for dirt on the Bidens and $250 million in U. S. military aid for Ukraine, which has been engaged in a five-year civil war with pro-Russian separatists. The aid was inexplicably delayed, then released soon after Congress raised concerns about the whistleblower complaint.
Was a meeting with Zelensky or the promise of Ukrainian assistance somehow, by inference or otherwise, made contingent on Kiev investigating Biden? If true, that would be a gross abuse of presidential power.
Trump acknowledged Sunday that he spoke with Zelensky about a Biden investigation, defending the conversation as appropriate and "perfect. " His defenders, meanwhile, fanned out on the morning talk shows to dispense a confusing smokescreen of unproven allegations against the Bidens.
All the while, the unnamed whistleblower's account languishes in the dark.
The intelligence community's inspector general, Trump appointee Michael Atkinson, was so troubled by the report that he deemed it of "urgent concern. "
The law requires that an urgent-concern whistleblower complaint "shall" be turned over to Congress. But the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, blocked this. His legal response, supplied by the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, is that the alleged target of the complaint — presumably Trump himself — is not a member of the intelligence community, so the urgent-concern requirements for the whistleblower law are not applicable.
That justification is painfully reminiscent of the legal gymnastics Mueller employed when he concluded that he was barred from saying whether Trump broke the law by obstructing justice in the Russian influence investigation, but that he also couldn't "exonerate" him.
A system of checks and balances guaranteed by the Constitution should inform the American people when their president violates the law or commits an impeachable offense. That system is being stretched to the breaking point.
Now it's up to members of Congress — not just Democrats but also Republicans who claim to believe in the rule of law — to get to the bottom of this latest tawdry tale by holding hearings, obtaining transcripts, and finding a way to gain access to the whistleblower complaint or that person's testimony.

Kay Ann Johnson, Hampshire College professor who wrote about the adoption of orphans in China, dies

Texto completo: “Nowhere is the tenacious Chinese preference for sons more clear than in China's orphanages," Kay Ann Johnson wrote to open her 2004 book “Wanting a Daughter, Needing a Son: Abandonment, Adoption, and Orphanage Care in China," which examined the fate children faced in China during the government's crackdown on overpopulation.
In an orphanage in the Hubei Province, “nearly all the infants and healthy older children are girls," she observed, and added: “At this fundamental level — the level at which someone decides to keep or abandon a child — the gender bias of Chinese society is overwhelming."
An Asian studies scholar whose adoption of a baby girl from China led her to spend years researching the impact of the country's one-child policy on rural families, she had taught at Hampshire College for many years.
Dr. Johnson died Aug. 14 of complications of metastatic breast cancer. She was 73 and lived in Amherst.
While working on an oral history of a village in North China in 1991, Dr. Johnson adopted a 3-month-old girl, Tang Li (who became known as LiLi), from an orphanage in Wuhan, a city in China's Hubei Province. She and her husband, Bill Grohmann, already had a biological son.
China was more than a decade into enforcing its one-child policy, a draconian effort by the Communist government to curb the country's population growth. The rule required families to make painful decisions about whether or not to keep their children.
They would pay stiff fines to keep children born “out of plan"; hide them from authorities; abandon or relinquish them; or find friends and relatives who could surreptitiously adopt them. In a culture that generally values boys over girls, those decisions were even more complicated for families when the child was a girl.
“Like most adoptive parents, I wondered about the people who gave birth to my daughter and apparently left her on the streets of a big city," Dr. Johnson wrote in her 2016 book “China's Hidden Children: Abandonment, Adoption, and the Human Costs of the One-Child Policy."
Dr. Johnson wanted LiLi, whose full name is Lee Helen Tang Li Johnson, to learn about the plight of parents in China and understand how she came to be among the first of 120,000 Chinese children to be adopted internationally.
“Such understanding, I imagined," Dr. Johnson wrote, “could help mitigate feelings of bitterness against her birth parents, and above all help assuage a young child's often unspoken worries about 'what was wrong with me,' 'what did I do wrong to lose my parents,' worries that my daughter articulated when she was only 3 years old."
For more than 20 years, Dr. Johnson focused her research on Chinese villages where birth parents found themselves in a lopsided clash with a state bent on controlling population. The policy was also applied in cities, but villagers were usually more daring about trying to resist it. Dr. Johnson presented her research in often painful case studies based on interviews with birth parents who described facing the ruthless policy.
One of those parents, Jiang Lifeng, already had a son when she became pregnant. She planned to keep the child and hoped to have a daughter. She avoided detection (and possibly forced sterilization) during pregnancy tests imposed by the authorities by using a friend's urine. She delivered a girl, Shengshi. But nine months later the infant was taken from her bedroom by seven men, presumably government representatives, and driven away in a van.
Jiang recalled that “she 'felt the sky fall down' on her as she staggered after them, shocked and aghast at what had just happened," Dr. Johnson wrote. Jiang somehow caught up to the van and rode with the men and Shengshi to a local birth planning office, where she and her husband, Xu Guangwen, pleaded for the girl's return. Officials refused.
The couple were told that they could adopt her after she had been taken to an orphanage. But that, Dr. Johnson said, was a lie.
“The government had taken their baby, stripped them of their parental rights, and left them heartbroken and powerless to do anything about it," she wrote. “It had been nothing short of a kidnapping by the government, leaving them no recourse."
Reviewing “China's Hidden Children" in Foreign Affairs magazine, Columbia University professor Andrew J. Nathanwrote that Dr. Johnson's “extraordinary book conveys the intense suffering of ordinary people struggling to build families against the will of an implacable bureaucracy."
Dr. Johnson was born in 1946, in Chicago. Her father, D. Gale Johnson, was an agricultural economist and the chairman of the economics department at the University of Chicago. Her mother, Helen Wallace Johnson, was a homemaker who volunteered at the University of Chicago Hospitals.
Dr. Johnson graduated with a bachelor's degree and a master's, both in political science from the University of Wisconsin Madison and also received a doctorate, writing a thesis about women's rights and family reform in China. Along the way she learned to speak Chinese fluently.
She taught political science at the University of California San Diego for five years and, in 1979, joined the faculty at Hampshire, where she was a professor of Asian studies and political science. For the past few years she ran Hampshire's Luce Initiative on Asian Studies and the Environment.
Dr. Johnson's first book, “Women, the Family and Peasant Revolution in China" (1983), was adapted from her thesis. “China's Hidden Children" was published in 2016, soon after China ended its one-child policy, in part to increase its labor supply, and officially announced that married couples would be allowed to have two children.
A service will be announced for Dr. Johnson. In addition to her husband and her daughter, who lives in Madison, Wis., and is a doctoral candidate in American studies at Yale University, Dr. Johnson leaves a son, Jesse Johnson of Hefei, China; a stepdaughter, Elena Ritter; and a brother, David Johnson of Sinking Spring, Pa.
Dr. Johnson's adoption of LiLi was among the first of a Chinese infant in the United States.
Shanti Fry had heard about the adoption from a friend, which led her to adopt an infant from the same orphanage as LiLi and to become the founding president of the New England chapter of a support group, Families with Children from China.
“Kay really opened the door, and word quickly spread in the Massachusetts community that this could be a viable option," Fry told the Times. Dr. Johnson had advised her group and two agencies that subsequently arranged adoptions from China.
“I imagine Kay going to China," said Fry, who adopted a second girl there, “figuring a way to adopt a child, forging her way through Chinese bureaucracy, and then giving us the confidence to let us adopt."
In “China's Hidden Children," Dr. Johnson wrote that her “role as an adoptive mother has positioned me as an empathetic audience for the Chinese adoptive parents and birth parents I have met as part of this study."
She added that she hoped she had “done justice to their stories as I try to provide an account of the experiences of parents and children caught in the population policy currents of this era."

Texto completo: From 2050, a look back at our political evolution:
A crisis of legitimacy swept across American politics in the second decade of the 21st century. Many people had the general conviction that the old order was corrupt and incompetent. There was an inchoate desire for some radical transformation. This mood swept the Republican Party in 2016 as Donald Trump eviscerated the GOP establishment and it swept through the Democratic Party in 2020.
In the 2020 primary race Joe Biden stood as the candidate for linear change and Elizabeth Warren stood as the sharp break from the past. Biden was the front-runner, but fragile. Many of the strongest debate performers - Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg and Michael Bennet - couldn't get any traction because Biden occupied the moderate lane. By the time he faded, it was too late.
Warren triumphed over the other progressive populist, Bernie Sanders, because she had what he lacked - self-awareness. She could run a campaign that mitigated her weaknesses. He could not.
Biden was holding on until Warren took Iowa and New Hampshire. He or some other moderate could have recovered, but the California primary had been moved up to March 3, Super Tuesday. When Warren dominated most of the states that day, it was over. The calendar ensured that the most progressive candidate would win.
Many pundits predicted that Warren was too much the progressive regulator-in-chief to win a general election. Indeed, her personal favorability remained low. But the election was about Trump - his personal disgraces but also the fact that he told a white ethnic national narrative that appealed only to a shrinking segment of the country.
Warren won convincingly. The Democrats built a bigger majority in the House, and to general surprise, won a slim Senate majority of 52-48.
After that election, the Republicans suffered a long, steady decline. Trump was instantly reviled by everyone - he had no loyal defenders. Only 8% of young people called themselves conservatives. Republican voters, mostly older, were dying out, and they weren't making new ones. For the ensuing two decades the party didn't resonate beyond its white rural base.
The American educated class celebrated the Warren victory with dance-in-the-street euphoria. In staffing her administration, she rejected the experienced Clinton-Obama holdovers and brought in a new cadre from the progressive left.
The euphoria ended when Warren tried to pass her legislative agenda. One by one, her proposals failed in the Senate: "Medicare for All," free college, decriminalizing unauthorized border crossings, even the wealth tax. Democratic senators from red states, she learned, were still from red states; embracing her agenda would have been suicidal. Warren and her aides didn't help. Fired by their sense of moral superiority, they were good at condemnation, not coalition-building.
When the recession of 2021 hit, things got ugly. The failure of two consecutive presidencies had a devastating effect on American morale. It became evident that the nation had three political tendencies - conservative populism, progressive populism and moderate liberalism. None of them could put together a governing majority to get things done.
Before Warren, people thought of liberals and progressives as practically synonymous. After Warren, it was clear they were different, with different agendas and different national narratives.
Moderate liberals had a basic faith in American institutions and thought they just needed reform. They had basic faith in capitalism and the Constitution and revered the classical liberal philosophy embedded in America's founding. They inherited Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass' millennial nationalism, a sense that America has a special destiny as the last best hope of Earth.
Progressives had much less faith in American institutions - in capitalism, the Constitution, the founding. They called for more structural change to things like the Supreme Court, the Electoral College and the basic structures of the market. Trump's victory in 2016 had served for them as proof that racism is the dominant note in American history - that the founding was 1619, not 1776. They were willing to step on procedural liberalism in order to get radical change.
With the Republicans powerless and irrelevant, the war within the Democratic Party grew vicious. Progressives detested moderate liberals even more than they did conservatives. The struggle came to a head with another set of Democratic primaries in 2024.
The moderate liberals triumphed easily. It turns out that the immigrant groups, by then a large and organized force in American politics, had not lost faith in the American dream, they had not lost faith in capitalism. They simply wanted more help so they could compete within it.
By 2030, progressive populism burned out as right-wing populism had. The Democrats became the nation's majority party. This party ran on a one-word platform: unity. After decades of culture, class and demographic warfare, moderate liberals defined America as a universal nation, a pluralistic nation, embracing all and seeking opportunity for all.
In a wildly diverse nation, voters handed power to leaders who were coalition-builders not fighters. The whole tenor of American politics changed.

Texto completo: Bruce Springsteen has a story to tell.
That's one aspect of a young Springsteen that former manager Carl "Tinker" West noticed early on.
"He's a good storyteller," said West, who's also a giant in the surfing world thanks to his founding of Challenger Eastern Surfboards in Ocean Township. "Vini (Lopez of the future E Street Band) brought him over to the shop (in Ocean Township). He was a smart kid, sort of quiet and he wrote songs. I said, 'You just keep writing something, you guys rehearse — work here all day, make surfboards and rock 'n' roll.'"
That was the plan. It worked.
Springsteen has sold millions of records, plays to stadiums around the world, is enshrined in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2016, all for his rock 'n' rolling.
Now as Springsteen turns 70 on Monday, he's in an era of new artistic pursuits, new creative formats. The latest is the movie "Western Stars," a filmed version of his latest album. He co-directed "Western Stars" with frequent collaborator Thom Zimny. The film features a performance of the folk-rock orchestral album, and vignettes starring a solo Springsteen.
The film follows the hit "Springsteen on Broadway," which featured the Boss baring his life story, set to song and remembrance. "Springsteen on Broadway" ran from October 2017 to December 2018.
The music play was based on his New York Times best-selling memoir "Born to Run," which was released in September 2016. Springsteen did a nine-city book tour, where he greeted thousands of fans in person for hours at a stretch in a feat of physical and mental stamina.
The Boss stood on a platform, under lights, while he met fans.
Cindy Marselis of Huntington Valley, Pennsylvania, was in tears after meeting Springsteen at the Freehold Barnes and Noble signing on Sept. 27, 2016.
"I met the person I always wanted to meet," said Marselis, at the signing. "I got to kiss him. It was awesome."
Springsteen is still telling stories, and still on stage. But now he's exploring new formats for the stories, and the stories he's telling are largely his own these days.
"I think he's said this before, but he truly envisions himself as an artist and I feel that all of these projects are in service of him wanting to tap into all of the different facets of who he is," said Caroline Madden, 26, of Toms River.
Madden is set to release a book on Springsteen's music in films and TV, "Springsteen as Soundtrack: The Sound of the Boss in Film and Television," from McFarland & Co. "That's why he's so unique and has endured as an artist for so long – he doesn't settle. He's always looking to renew himself or try something new."
West saw that creative energy up close when Springsteen fronted the band Steel Mill, which West managed and did sound for.
"I liked Springsteen because those guys would go in the back of the shop and they would rehearse," West said. "Vini Lopez, Danny Federici, they would write lots of music and whenever we'd get a couple of songs together that were pretty good, we'd go and try it out at Pandemonium, right at the bottom of Sunset Avenue."
The club was less than a mile from West's surfboard factory.
"What changes his music is that he wants to write something different," West said. "He writes some great stories. Stories to me are what makes great music, especially the early stuff. The first two albums ('Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.' and 'The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle'), people are still asking for those songs. Even so, he's written a lot of stuff after that's pretty damn good."
West and Springsteen's enduring friendship is explored in the book "Born to Run" and, subsequently in "Springsteen on Broadway." A highlight of the play is West, Springsteen and West's dog driving out west in West's 1950 Chevy flat-bed truck to play a concert and meet music industry contacts.
Springsteen didn't know how to drive until he drove the Chevy truck with West in the passenger seat. West still owns the truck.
"He knew what he wanted to do, I'm pretty sure," said West of Springsteen's artistic drive. "He wanted to wow an audience and he did. He had a great band. Federici was great. Lopez was great. Little Vinnie Roslin was great."
West used his connections and hustle to get a deal with Paramount Records.
"I finally found a deal that wouldn't screw him over," West said. "Then he said 'I don't want to do Steel Mill anymore.' (I said) That's up to you."
"I introduced him to Mike Appel. He introduced him to John Hammond and the rest is history," said West of Springsteen's subsequent manager and the of the famed Columbia Records talent scout. .
The stories Springsteen has been telling in recent years are stark, revealing and confessional.
"For a long time, if I loved you or if I felt a deep attachment to you, I would hurt you if I could," says Springsteen in "Western Stars."
He talked without censor of his troubled relationship with his father in "Springsteen on Broadway" and has been candid about his struggles with mental illness.
"I have come close enough to (mental illness) where I know I am not completely well myself," Springsteen previously told Esquire. "I've had to deal with a lot of it over the years, and I'm on a variety of medications that keep me on an even keel; otherwise I can swing rather dramatically and ... just ... the wheels can come off a little bit. So we have to watch, in our family. I have to watch my kids, and I've been lucky there. It ran in my family going way before my dad."
Springsteen is married to Patti Scialfa and they have three children, Evan, 29; Jessica, 27; and Sam, 25.
Springsteen's non-rock 'n' roll work of the past few years has also framed the aging process for fans. He's showing the way to baby boomers about what to do, how to do it, and what's important in life when you get to a certain age.
The fans of his generation might have looked to John Lennon for the answers, but he didn't get to grow old like Springsteen. Lennon would have been 78 if he were still alive.
"Aging is scary but fascinating, and great talent morphs in strange and often enlightening ways," said Springsteen in "Born to Run."
There no official events planned to recognize Springsteen's 70th birthday, but area venues do have Boss-themed shows, including the Brian Kirk and the Jirk's-led "Born: Celebrating the Boss' 70th" at the Count Basie Center in Red Bank on Wednesday, Sept. 25, and Thursday, Sept. 26. Visit thebasie.org for more info and tickets.
"Springsteen: His Hometown," an exhibit presented by the Monmouth County Historical Association and the Bruce Springsteen Archives and Center for American Music at Monmouth University, opens Sunday, Sept. 29, at the historical association in Freehold.
Ticket information is at www.SpringsteenHisHometown.com.
Preview showings of "Western Stars" are scheduled for Oct. 19 and 23 in area movie theaters. Visit www.fathomevents.com for more info and tickets.
As for the E Street Band, Springsteen ain't done yet, despite the success he's had with his new avenues of artistic expression.
"We want the band to get back together," said Springsteen to applause on Sept. 12 at the Toronto International Film Festival. "I've got some songs written for the band and I'd like to make a really good rock band record with the E Street Band.
"We'll be seeing you."

The bodycon look appeared expensive in photos, but Shayk's outfit is affordable, retailing at $129 for the top and $59.99 for the skirt. Equally surprising, the pieces were made from recycled polyester.
Shayk's look was from H&M's fall and winter 2019 Conscious Exclusive collection. New statement pieces from the limited-edition line, which is celebrating its 10th anniversary, are made from sustainable materials -- recycled brass and zinc, and a blend of Tencel and Refibra, a branded lyocell fiber made from discarded cotton.
"We're always on the lookout for new innovations, new fabrics and new processes," said H&M creative advisor Ann-Sofie Johansson. "We wanted to show that sustainable fashion doesn't have to look boring or beige or like a burlap sack."

Inspired by masquerade balls, the new fall and winter collection includes evening-wear such as a pink tulle ballgown, velvet blazer and pants, and a delicate pink beaded bolero. Prices range from $14.99 for accessories to $299.99 for a dress. The collection of 25 pieces and 11 accessories (including earrings, boots and purses) goes on sale Sept. 26 at hm.com.
"It's really cool that fashion brands are starting to move toward saving nature," Shayk told The Times during an interview earlier this year. "Hopefully other brands will follow and will use sustainable or recyclable products."
Despite the fast-fashion retailer's good intentions, its eco-collections haven't gone without criticism. Some fashion fans have cried foul, pointing out that H&M was preaching sustainability while sitting on $4.3 billion in unsold inventory, according to the New York Times and other news outlets in 2018. (In recent years, H&M has faced financial challenges as well, having announced last year that it would close 170 stores. However, Hennes & Mauritz AB's recent annual report showed that its net sales increased by 11% in the first half of 2019.)
The company has taken the criticism to heart. Although the brand's U.S. communications and press director, Emily Scarlett, called the issue "complicated," she said the retailer has "three big long-term commitment goals" when it comes to sustainability. According to Scarlett, by 2020, all of H&M's cotton will come from "more sustainable or recycled sources."
By 2030, she said, everything it produces will come from "more sustainable or recycled sources," and by 2040, the company wants to reduce more greenhouse gas emissions than it will emit during the production process -- and take other eco-friendly steps.
Scarlett said she hopes more people will embrace the company's garment collecting program, which encourages consumers to bring in old clothing in exchange for 15% off their next H&M purchase.
Launched in 2013, the program aims to keep textiles out of landfills. "You can donate or drop off any clothing in any condition from any brand or home textiles to any H&M across the country in any country where H&M operates and we will take the clothing," Scarlett said, explaining that a third-party shoe and clothing collecting partner, I: Collect, sorts garments so the pieces get a potential second life. Some wind up on the vintage or resale market, while others are cut up and turned into cleaning cloths or insulation for stuffed animals. The remaining pieces are broken down and turned into new fabrics.
"We actually have denim within the H&M range that is made out of things that have been donated to the garment-collecting initiative," Scarlett said, adding that the brand collected "3.4 million pounds of unwanted textiles" in the U.S. in 2018. "But we have a long way to go," she said. "We have an aggressive goal for 2019. In the U.S., we hope to collect 4 million pounds in 2019 and we're doing really well so far."
H&M also has been working with celebrities to draw attention to its sustainability message. In March, stars turned out to support H&M's sustainability efforts, attending a party in the Hollywood Hills. Dakota Fanning, Amber Valletta, Alek Wek, Rowan Blanchard, Camila Morrone, Abigail Spencer and Shayk were among those who attended, clad in pieces from the Conscious Exclusive spring line.
"H&M is a massive, global company," said Valletta, who starred in the brand's 2014 Conscious Exclusive collection campaign. "For them to come out and speak about being sustainable and making major changes in their supply chain and their fabrics and recycling -- it's a major milestone, and it helps amplify the message of where fashion needs to go."
Blanchard said she has worn Conscious Exclusive pieces a few times. "I think it's really neat," she said. Vegan fashion is "definitely something I would like to be more mindful about. Sustainable fashion is really hard in terms of accessibility, which is why this is great. It's definitely something I could be more conscious of, but I do try to buy a lot of vintage and thrift clothes, which, I think, is recycling."

Texto completo: The Democratic field got a little bit smaller this week, shrinking to 19 candidates. Here's our weekly catch-up on the 2020 election and some moments you may have missed.
'Clearly not my time'
Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York, who entered the Democratic presidential race on the hopes that his brand of urban progressive leadership could appeal on a national scale, said on Friday that he was ending his candidacy.
Mr. de Blasio's campaign never quite caught on, and his announcement came less than two weeks before the qualification deadline for the October debate. His inclusion in the event was growing less likely by the day.
"I feel like I've contributed all I can to this primary campaign, and it's clearly not my time," he said in an appearance on MSNBC's "Morning Joe." "I'm going to end my presidential campaign, continue my work as mayor of New York City, and I'm going to keep speaking up for working people."
■ Read more about Mr. de Blasio's exit here.
■ And here's our magazine piece about his journey from progressive hope to punching bag.
A big day for Warren
Monday was big for Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.
She received the endorsement of the Working Families Party, a labor-aligned progressive group that endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont during the last presidential cycle.
She released a 6,000-word anti-corruption plan, which would make the release of tax returns automatic for candidates for federal office, make it illegal for elected officials to become lobbyists and strengthen ethics requirements for federal judges.
And in a speech at a rally in Manhattan that drew thousands to Washington Square Park, she forcefully attacked corruption and invoked the power of women to bring about sweeping change.
Ms. Warren delivered the speech blocks from the site of the Triangle shirtwaist factory fire of 1911, which killed 146 garment workers, most of them immigrant women. It was one of the deadliest industrial disasters in the nation's history.
"The tragic story of the Triangle factory fire is a story about power," Ms. Warren said. "A story of what happens when the rich and the powerful take control of government and use it to increase their own profits while they stick it to working people. But what happened in the aftermath of the fire is a different story about power -- a story about our power, a story about what's possible when we fight together as one."
■ Our colleague Alexander Burns noted that in dueling speeches Monday night, Ms. Warren and President Trump laid out competing visions of populism.
Sanders shakes up his operation
With five months to go before the New Hampshire primary, Mr. Sanders overhauled his operations in the state, which he won by more than 22 percentage points in 2016.
Mr. Sanders, who hails from neighboring Vermont, almost certainly must win New Hampshire again next year to have a chance at the nomination.
The campaign also parted ways with its political director in Iowa, according to a report that surfaced later in the week. Read more about that move here.
'A sham process': Democrats call for Kavanaugh's impeachment
Several candidates called for the impeachment of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh after The New York Times published new information about allegations of sexual misconduct against him.
Ms. Warren, Mr. Sanders and Senator Kamala Harris of California were among those who called for the justice's impeachment.
"He was put on the Court through a sham process and his place on the Court is an insult to the pursuit of truth and justice," Ms. Harris wrote.
Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. called the revelations "profoundly troubling" but stopped short of demanding impeachment. Instead, he called for an investigation into "whether the Trump administration and Senate Republicans pressured the F.B.I. to ignore evidence."
■ Read our full report on the calls for impeachment.
Regulating marijuana like alcohol
Former Representative Beto O'Rourke of Texas released a plan on Thursday to legalize marijuana, expunge all possession convictions and regulate the substance the way alcohol is regulated. Sales would be limited to adults, smoking would be banned in public areas, and advertising would be restricted.
He also wants to tax the marijuana industry and invest the revenue in the communities of color disproportionately affected by the war on drugs.
Every Democratic candidate supports decriminalizing marijuana, and most, including Mr. O'Rourke, support full legalization. But six candidates -- Mr. Biden, Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana, Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Mayor Wayne Messam of Miramar, Fla., and former Representative Joe Sestak of Pennsylvania -- want to leave the question of legalization up to the states.
In other policy news:
■ Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey unveiled a plan to bolster workers' rights. It would protect the right to organize for all workers, including those in the gig economy; end anti-union "right-to-work" laws; and change the way capital gains are taxed.
■ Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., released a disaster preparedness plan to help communities prepare for and recover from storms. It aims to improve coordination between federal agencies and storm victims, fortify infrastructure and strengthen the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
■ Mr. Buttigieg also detailed his "Medicare for All Who Want It" plan, which seeks to ensure universal access to coverage by allowing all Americans to opt in to a public-coverage alternative.
■ Mr. Sanders introduced a $ 2.5 trillion housing proposal that calls for more public and affordable housing, as well as a national rent control law that would cap annual rent increases at 3 percent or one and a half times the inflation rate, whichever was higher.
■ Tom Steyer, the former hedge fund executive, released a "justice-centered climate plan," which he said would create nearly 46 million jobs over 10 years. He also promised to create a civilian climate corps as part of a broad "national service plan," which would aim for a million annual participants by 2025.
And finally ...
Overheard on the campaign trail?
"I'm moving to Iowa," Ms. Harris joked in a comment to Senator Mazie Hirono of Hawaii that included an expletive and was overheard by a reporter.
The state of California did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Ms. Harris's remark came as her campaign announced a new push in the state. In a call with reporters Thursday morning, aides said they hoped to position Ms. Harris for a late-breaking Iowa surge. And they set a firm target: a top-three finish.
Ms. Harris's team sent out a fund-raising email based on her quip. And, of course, there are already T-shirts.

Finding New York Summer, in Parties

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
When the Metro desk at The New York Times set out to capture what summer in New York looks like, its editors set their sights on an unlikely source -- a data set. A data set of parties, to be specific.
Rebecca Lieberman, a graphics editor in digital news design, sifted through a publicly available data set of block party permits to identify potential sites. The information provided was relatively scant -- little more than a party name ("Wake Fest 2019" or "Biggie Smalls Block Party," for instance), a time frame and an address. She mapped them all.
That was enough for the editors on the Metro desk, who deployed a team of 20 photographers to all five boroughs to capture the events over three weekends in August. It amounted to an all-out flooding of the block party circuit, with some photographers visiting as many as eight parties. They photographed, reported on and filmed the parties -- filing from 65 in total.
The imagery conveys a warm sense of community and celebration on summer days across the city. The photographers captured it all, from photos of children in Marine Park eagerly eyeing the watermelon in their palms, to a dog strapped into a carrier in a crowd watching a woman dance in South Williamsburg. They filmed a group of children dancing to "Old Town Road" in the Laurelton evening, and photographed a child cloaked in cotton candy.
The project represented a new lens through which to look at life in New York -- and a change of pace for a desk tasked with covering topics like measles outbreaks, Bill de Blasio's administration and subway woes.
"This is kind of an opportunity to do something that just kind of celebrates life and the summer and joyfulness," said Jeffrey Furticella, a staff photo editor on the Metro desk.
The photographers found it to be a unique opportunity to document ordinary gatherings of New Yorkers taking part in their versions of a summertime tradition, each with its own flavor, which collectively painted a picture of neighborhood life in New York.
At the block parties, the photographers sought to capture moments of community -- the games, dancing, conversation and food -- that represented what the parties mean across the boroughs. When the Times staff photographer Todd Heisler found out a father was celebrating his son's birthday, he made sure to capture it. The photographer Laylah Amatullah Barrayn spotted a group of children in her own Brooklyn neighborhood playing a game of skully, flicking a bottle cap across the asphalt.
"Until you just put your feet on the street and get out there and start chatting people up, you won't know. That was what was so fun about it, the discovery part of it," Mr. Heisler said. "To be out and discover the serendipitous moments was the most satisfying part of it."
For their part, many of the partygoers were surprised to have their block parties, where they are used to recognizing everybody, attended by journalists. (Ms. Barrayn, for one, scouted the blocks in advance to introduce herself to the people she would be photographing.)
"People were kind of surprised about how we found out about their block parties, and a little mystified," Mr. Heisler said. "Everybody was really welcoming, but just surprised. Which kind of gets at the heart of the idea -- this idea that we hit every party we could and democratized it in a way, or just really tried to catch every corner of the city and celebrate life in every borough."
(They were pleased with the final product, too. In an email to the project's editor, Meghan Louttit, the photographer Gabriela Bhaskar wrote that after it went online, one of her subjects was "screaming thanks joyfully into the phone for this project and how well represented she felt this piece was.")
To anchor the piece, the desk integrated a personal essay from Sandra Garcia, a reporter on the Express desk, about her own experience growing up attending block parties. Ms. Garcia, who celebrated her childhood birthdays at block parties in Harlem, touched on the themes that make block parties uniquely New York to complement the imagery.
The project relied heavily on photographers who lived in the neighborhoods they photographed. "We wanted to work with photographers that intimately knew these communities and reflected the communities that they were photographing," Mr. Furticella said.
Many of the photographers, in turn, found through the assignment a reassuring state of affairs: Block parties, despite a decline in official permits, are alive and well.
"People think that New York is kind of losing its spirit, and I walked away from this saying, 'Wow, you still got it, New York,"' Mr. Heisler said. "It's nice to see that."
Ms. Garcia concurred.
"One thing about New Yorkers is we cherish this city," she said. "This is ours. The subways don't run right. Everything sucks. The schools aren't great. The rent is too damn high. But that's the one thing we have all together, the love for the city. Block parties are like the embodiment of that love. It's that love in real time."

Texto completo: By this time a year ago, the Trump administration had been sued 93 times over environmental rollbacks and policies that endanger the health of all Americans. Though the lawsuits are often filed by nonprofits, taxpayers usually foot the bill.
Imagine, if these dollars were spent on actual environmental protections, how much further ahead we would be on addressing climate change. Instead, our president (though I choose not to claim him) challenges policies that protect us, that reduce greenhouse emissions, that preserve our water supply and that respect Native American rights.
The rollbacks could significantly increase greenhouse gas emissions and lead to thousands of extra deaths due to poor air quality every year.
The New York Times printed a list of 85 environmental rollbacks gathered by Harvard and Columbia law schools.
I encourage you to read them and demand our legislators put the health of its citizens before industry gains.

JUST A QUICK REMINDER ABOUT TAKING YOUR GATOR TO THE AIRPORT

Texto completo: Alas, no pattern emerged this summer that could assist the authorities in predicting the location of the next Pittsburgh incident, so now it's pretty much a cold case because nobody's seen an alligator around here in more than two months.
Though it somehow commanded the attention of both the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times, two outlets that rarely agree on what is even an allegorical alligator and what is not, it appears our abbreviated reign as what somebody called the City of Chompions has ended without incident and with even less explanation.
That's partially why I'm heading to the airport.
Yeah, stay with me on this.
I didn't get to see any of Pittsburgh's four alligators - the one near the South Side Giant Eagle in May, the 5-footer in Beechview in June, the Carrick porch dweller a few days later or the one found loitering in a Shaler parking lot in mid-July.
Both Gator 1 and Gator 4 were apprehended within hissing distance of a Giant Eagle, but I wouldn't read anything into that. Even if boneless chicken breasts were on sale at some point during the relevant time frame, they don't stay on sale for two months.
Gator 4 was judged by authorities to be the least threatening, even though it still managed to generate one of the Great Moments in Pittsburgh-area Law Enforcement, when Shaler Police took the little guy's picture - he was a 2-footer - and posted it on Facebook above a caption that began, "If this is your alligator ... "
The only Pittsburgh gator with the potential for real menace was Chomp, the Beechview creature that left through a window after his owner let him out of a basement enclosure to clean it. Apparently the scores of other animals on the premises - having never been witness to a live alligator defenestration - were too awestruck to persuade Chomp to stay.
With noted reluctance (hissing and slithering), Chomp surrendered to authorities about 90 feet down the sidewalk, and I'm guessing that's about as theatrical as Pittsburgh's gator mania will ever get.
Unless I get lucky at an airport this weekend.
According to an email I received last week from the ever-informative Transportation Safety Administration, I'm almost as likely to see an alligator at a security checkpoint as anywhere else in the city.
Generally, the TSA does a fine job of screening things you shouldn't be carrying onto an airplane, but they do an even better job of counting them and cataloging unusual items. Because I'm flying coast-to-coast this weekend, I reminded myself to check their most recent stats.
Between Aug. 26 and Sept. 15, for example, the TSA found 253 guns in carry-on luggage nationally, 225 of them loaded, with 84 having a bullet in the chamber.
This is an improvement.
August brought only 329 guns to the TSA's attention at security checkpoints, down 13% from August 2018. At this rate, the likelihood that I'll be sitting next to someone who tried to bring a gun on the plane will be virtually nonexistent by the time I'm too old to fly anyway.
The TSA also reminds us that attempting to carry a gun aboard in carry-on baggage can result in a fine of $13,333 or an arrest. Further, that TSA-Pre status you're always bragging about, well you can kiss that goodbye. Honest to God, it says that on the website.
This probably came about from so many people saying, "What, no TSA-Pre? I've got to take my shoes off now? That's it. Where's my gun?"
Anyway, last week's TSA Week in Review hit my email with this teaser: "An Alligator?"
Apparently, at Shreveport (La.) Regional Airport, an X-ray screener spotted what appeared to be an alligator's head next to a grenade in someone's bag. That, of course, shut the line down temporarily while the screener - just to be safe, obviously - opened that particular carry-on to see what could possibly look like an alligator's head next to a grenade.
Turned out it was just an alligator's head next to a grenade.
Which, it turns out, is half legal.
The head of a deceased and/or taxidermy-treated alligator is legal in carry-on baggage, although the TSA recommends you check with your airline anyway.
By contrast, grenades - inert grenades, empty grenades, faux grenades, replica grenades - are never allowed. No grenades, people. We shouldn't have to tell you this.
Alligators, particularly parts of dead ones, are not grenades in the eyes of the TSA.
I'm not going to argue that any part of any alligator, living or dead, should have grenade status when it comes to air travel (including alligator bags), because it's just not worth it. I just don't want to sit next to someone who is traveling with a comfort gator.

Texto completo: Kenneth Mason, a maverick "advertising boy wonder" who lived in Deer Isle for years after abruptly quitting as president and CEO of Quaker Oats to rail against corporations' "profits-are-everything philosophy," died earlier this month.
An intellectual who went from Yale University into the advertising business after serving as a U.S. Army intelligence officer in World War II, the 97-year-old died Sept. 4, according to his obituary.
Mason is perhaps best known for rising to the post of president of Quaker Oats -- then one of America's largest companies -- in 1976 at age 54, then leaving the position three years later with a sharply critical view of American business.
In Business Week, Mason wrote, "the business 'profits-are-everything philosophy' is a dreary and demeaning view of the role of business and business leaders in our society."
"Making a profit is no more the purpose of a corporation than getting enough to eat is the purpose of life. Getting enough to eat is a requirement of life; life's purpose, one would hope, is somewhat broader and more challenging," he added.
A charismatic speaker, Mason had a sharp wit and roving mind. He liked to quote poems and vast passages of Shakespeare and Chaucer, and mated his business pursuits with more community-minded endeavors whenever he could.
Born March 2, 1922, in Asheville, North Carolina, he graduated from the Asheville School for Boys in 1939, and from Yale University in 1943. His fluency in French and intellect likely helped him in his service with the Sixth Armored Division in France, where he earned the Bronze Star in 1945 for his apprehension of the killer of a military policeman.
Mason published stories in Women's Day, Chicago Magazine and many others during the war before returning to the U.S. and beginning a prominent career as an advertising executive in Chicago and Los Angeles. Mason joined the Quaker Oats Co. as advertising director in 1962, then became group vice president for U.S. Grocery Products and a member of the board of directors in 1968. In 1974 he became executive vice president in charge of Quaker's worldwide grocery business before becoming president and CEO two years later.
His life included sojourns in the documentary arts where he was a passionate critic of aspects of his own business -- the effects of television and advertising on children preoccupied him. During his time at Quaker Oats, he helped produce several children's programs and films, including "Say Goodbye," which was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature in 1971.
He became a controversial figure in the business world when he scoffed at economist Milton Friedman's claim in The New York Times Magazine in 1970 that businesses cannot serve social good because to do so means using other people's money -- from investors, customers and employees -- in ways that those individuals would not necessarily condone.
Government and charities had as their aim the use of funds for the common good, not businesses, Friedman said.
Mason argued that Americans should "encourage, not evade, discussion of those problems that arise when the activities of business conflict with the needs and concerns of society."
The "moral imperative" for businesses was to get "the best return we can on whatever assets we are privileged to employ," he argued. Those assets were not just financial assets, "but also the brains employed, the labor employed, the materials employed, and the land, air, and water employed," he said.
By the late 1970s, Mason and his wife of 56 years, Cherie, left the corporate world to move to Pine Island, Minnesota, to pursue more contemplative aims.
At the time, he told The New York Times, "I'm a very old 57. I've felt for many years that I would like to reserve a percentage of my years to do some thinking about the world and business and social problems. I'm not retiring that much earlier than people who retire at 62. I'm just beating them by five years."
A fire that destroyed their Pine Island home compelled the couple's move to Deer Isle, where Mason continued writing. In the fall of 1992 his short story, "The Adulterers," was published in The Iowa Review and in 1995 it was selected to be part of its 25th anniversary retrospective anthology.
Besides his wife, Mason is survived by his daughter Shelley.

JUST A QUICK REMINDER ABOUT TAKING YOUR GATOR TO THE AIRPORT

Texto completo: Alas, no pattern emerged this summer that could assist the authorities in predicting the location of the next Pittsburgh incident, so now it's pretty much a cold case because nobody's seen an alligator around here in more than two months.
Though it somehow commanded the attention of both the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times, two outlets that rarely agree on what is even an allegorical alligator and what is not, it appears our abbreviated reign as what somebody called the City of Chompions has ended without incident and with even less explanation.
That's partially why I'm heading to the airport.
Yeah, stay with me on this.
I didn't get to see any of Pittsburgh's four alligators - the one near the South Side Giant Eagle in May, the 5-footer in Beechview in June, the Carrick porch dweller a few days later or the one found loitering in a Shaler parking lot in mid-July.
Both Gator 1 and Gator 4 were apprehended within hissing distance of a Giant Eagle, but I wouldn't read anything into that. Even if boneless chicken breasts were on sale at some point during the relevant time frame, they don't stay on sale for two months.

FBI's secretive demands for information go far beyond tech companies

Texto completo: Letters have been issued to scores of firms, without court oversight
The FBI has sent secretive written demands for information to more than 120 companies in recent years - including telecommunications providers, technology firms and credit agencies - according to documents released Friday, raising new questions about the government's ability to quietly gather data on people.
The demands - called national security letters, or NSLs - are issued without court oversight and typically are accompanied by gag orders for the companies. The people whose data is being requested rarely know of the NSLs or have the opportunity to contest their demands in court.
The new documents, released through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a civil liberties group, underscore ongoing questions about the effectiveness of a 2015 law designed, in part, to bring some transparency to the issuing and enforcing of NSLs.
Atop the list of companies the documents show received NSLs are credit agencies Equifax, Experian and TransUnion; telecommunications providers AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon; financial services companies Bank of America, Western Union and Capital One; and technology companies Google, Microsoft and Facebook. Some received dozens, others just a few.
None of the companies commented Friday on the disclosures aside from saying that they comply with the requirements of NSLs, as mandated by law. The law specifically permits the FBI to issue NSLs to companies in these industries. The New York Times first reported on the publication of the new documents by EFF on Friday.
Some of the technology companies have been public about their receipt of NSLs and in some cases have published redacted versions of the letters to raise awareness of the practice, released tabulations of their numbers in regular reports or fought the gag orders in court.
Companies in other industries, such as telecommunications and banking, typically have complied with the demands for information, which government officials have said are crucial to pursuing investigations of terrorism or intelligence matters.
Hundreds of thousands of NSLs have been issued since the 9/11 attacks, which prompted an expansion in the government's collection of evidence from records kept by private companies.
The documents released by EFF included more than 750 "termination letters" that lifted the gag orders on companies that had received NSLs. The letters were produced during an FBI review of its NSL gag orders, as directed by the 2015 law. The bureau considered nearly 12,000 gag orders during its review and ordered they be lifted in 6 percent of them, records show. The FBI, which declined to comment on the documents, issues thousands of new NSLs each year.
"They're sending these out faster than they are removing them," said Andrew Crocker, a senior staff attorney for EFF, based in San Francisco. "So that's a recipe for increasing the amount of secrecy, not decreasing it."
NSLs are written directives from the FBI demanding confidential communication or financial transaction records. They are used most often to obtain records of telephone and electronic communications but also to get financial records and consumer credit information.
While NSLs date to the 1980s, the FBI's use of them as an investigative tool spiked after the 2001 terrorist attacks.
The push to overhaul the use of NSLs grew out of the broad public backlash to revelations by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden in 2013.
His trove of internal NSA documents showed how the government's sweeping surveillance systems collected data whenever people worldwide - and in some situations, U.S. citizens - shared emails, chatted on the phone or engaged with video calls with loved ones.
NSLs, compared with the NSA's technological data collection tools, are a more targeted way to gather information but have long drawn complaints from privacy and civil liberties advocates because of their lack of judicial oversight and transparency. Search warrants require approval from a judge to establish probable cause. The legal standard for NSLs is lower: The records being sought must be considered relevant to an investigation.
Officials defending NSLs say they allow investigators to follow leads in sensitive cases without targets knowing that they are under suspicion - a tactic that can potentially increase the possibility of arrest or even head off violent attacks.

Resumen: The recent fiasco at The New York Times, which last weekend published the latest uncorroborated sexual-assault accusation against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, was a monument to hearsay and a travesty of journalistic ethics. In it, the authors reported allegations by a Yale classmate that Kavanaugh was at a "drunken dorm party" where "friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student." With apologies to my grandmothers, the reason The Times’ writers likely included the penis-in-hand accusation at all is because it added context to the accusations by both Deborah Ramirez, who alleged last year that she experienced sexual misconduct by Kavanaugh at another boozy Yale party, and Christine Blasey Ford.

Texto completo: The recent fiasco at The New York Times, which last weekend published the latest uncorroborated sexual-assault accusation against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, was a monument to hearsay and a travesty of journalistic ethics.
The story, since modified to include crucial information, was an adapted excerpt from a book — "The Education of Brett Kavanaugh," written by two Times’ staff writers, Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly. In it, the authors reported allegations by a Yale classmate that Kavanaugh was at a "drunken dorm party" where "friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student."
Setting aside the logistics of such a feat, more eye-popping was the omission from the original Times’ piece that the alleged victim refused to be interviewed for the book — and, according to friends, doesn’t remember any such incident.
Such an oversight is inexcusable.
The Times added these details to the story after they were flagged by The Federalist’s Mollie Hemingway, who had an advance copy of the book. The Times’ writers, who said that the details had been in the excerpt’s initial draft, made media rounds Monday and Tuesday to explain the omission and essentially blamed editors, who, they said, "in the haste" of trying to close out production, had deleted the reference.
The facts that the alleged victim refused to be interviewed by the authors and apparently told friends that she doesn’t recall any such incident amount to the very definition of a non-story. For the record, The Washington Post learned of the accusation last year but declined to publish it because the alleged witnesses weren’t identified and the woman said to be involved refused to comment.
Indeed, the authors’ only sources for the claim were two unnamed officials who spoke to Washington attorney Max Stier, who last year apparently told the FBI and various senators that he witnessed the alleged incident. But Stier refused to talk to the Times’ writers himself.
Some Democratic contenders for the presidency immediately called for Kavanaugh’s impeachment. They include Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Sen. Kamala Harris, former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg.
But let’s rewind the reel a bit. With apologies to my grandmothers, the reason The Times’ writers likely included the penis-in-hand accusation at all is because it added context to the accusations by both Deborah Ramirez, who alleged last year that she experienced sexual misconduct by Kavanaugh at another boozy Yale party, and Christine Blasey Ford.
Ramirez, for her part, initially wasn’t quite sure of events. She has admitted to time lapses and also to having been drunk, but told The New Yorker and the Times writers that she remembers brushing away a penis thrust in her face, allegedly by Kavanaugh.
If these stories are true, then Kavanaugh could have been a creepy, perhaps monstrous, drunk in his youth. But all we have to go by is alleged victims who also were drinking at the time and comments from former classmates, who may also have been inebriated, some of whom corroborate the Ramirez accusation and others who dispute it. The Times’ writers reported finding seven people who they say corroborated Ramirez’s story, but much of what they documented were second- and third-hand reports, things overheard and, yes, Ramirez’s mother, to whom she apparently said "Something happened at Yale."
Not exactly a wrap for justice.
The truth is, Kavanaugh has been the target of a media siege since his name was announced for consideration for the high court. Ramirez’s story was first reported by The New Yorker just days before Ford’s congressional testimony, which, frankly, was flimsy at best. None of the other four people Ford named as attending the high school party where she claimed Kavanaugh groped her recalled any such gathering. One of them, a close friend and the only other female, Leland Keyser, not only doesn’t remember the party — but says she’s never even met Kavanaugh.
What’s all too clear is that America’s privileged youth had a serious drinking problem in the early 1980s; and boozy memories from high school and young adulthood are unreliable. Far more troubling is that several presidential candidates seemingly would impeach a Supreme Court justice on nothing more than hearsay — and impeachable journalism.

Texto completo: President Trump sued his own accounting firm and Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance Jr. Thursday, seeking to prevent the prosecutor from getting his hands on eight years of tax returns.
The suit was filed in Manhattan Federal Court the same day that the accounting firm, Mazars USA, faced a deadline to turn over the records to Vance.
It comes only three days after reports that Vance sought the tax returns in connection with an investigation into Trump's $130,000 hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels during the 2016 presidential campaign.
Trump's legal team argues in the suit that the inquiry is politically motivated and that a sitting president cannot be criminally investigated while in office.
"Because the Mazars subpoena attempts to criminally investigate a sitting president, it is unconstitutional. This court should declare it invalid and enjoin its enforcement until the president is no longer in office," the suit reads.
"The subpoena is a bad faith effort to harass the president by obtaining and exposing his confidential information, not a legitimate attempt to enforce New York law."
The president's lawyer Jay Sekulow said the lawsuit is intended "to address the significant constitutional issues at stake in this case."
Trump's former fixer, Michael Cohen, pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations in connections with the payments. Evidence showed that the Trump Organization reimbursed Cohen.
Vance, a Democrat, is probing whether the Trump Organization may have falsely claimed the reimbursement as a legal expense, according to The New York Times. Falsifying business records can be a crime in New York and a felony if used to cover up other crimes. The subpoena also mentions Karen McDougal, who received a hush money payment from Trump via the National Enquirer's parent company, AMI.
"We have received the plaintiff's complaint and will respond as appropriate in court. We will have no further comment as this process unfolds in court," a Vance spokesman said.
Both McDougal and Daniels claim to have had affairs with Trump, which the president denies.
Judge Victor Marrero wrote he would rule on the challenge following a hearing. Mazars does not have to comply with the subpoena in the meantime.
Trump attorneys Marc Mukasey and Alan Futerfas were spotted by the Daily News outside of Marrero's chambers and declined comment.
Democrats in Congress are separately demanding Trump release his personal tax returns, but he has refused to do so.
Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin has defied a congressional subpoena for the returns and Trump has sued to block a state law that permits officials to disclose his state returns if Congress asks for them.
The new suit says that New York has been a "willing and eager participant" in a "campaign of bad-faith investigations and harassment of the President."

Arctic National Wildlife Refuge drilling is next chapter in long history of plundering Arctic resources

Texto completo: I'VE BEEN IN Old Crow for a week, and one of the first things people ask each other about is the caribou. Have you seen any upriver? Where? Bulls or cows? Moving in what direction?
Old Crow is 80 miles north of the Arctic Circle in Canada's Yukon, in the homelands of the Vuntut Gwitchin, one of a string of Indigenous Gwich'in villages stretching from the Northwest Territories to Alaska. People here have made their lives alongside migrating caribou since the end of the last ice age. In late August, we're waiting for the herd of some 170,000 animals to leave their summer birthing grounds in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) and head southeast, where they spend each winter.
In 2017, the Trump Administration announced plans to sell oil leases in ANWR. Exploration and drilling is widely accepted by environmental groups and by the Gwich'in as a threat to the Porcupine caribou herd and the ecosystem upon which they depend. But the income from the sales, which the White House estimated at $1.8 billion over a decade, was supposed to be a revenue generator in the wake of the 2017 Republican tax bill. Caribou lives would, indirectly, pay for a plan unusually beneficial to the wealthiest Americans.
But on Aug. 21, the New York Times reported that Trump's estimates of ANWR revenue were wildly inflated: the Times analysis estimated the number at just $45 million over a decade. A day later, this too was part of the news we shared in Old Crow.
Few people I've talked to here are surprised. Outside the Arctic, jiggering numbers and suppressing scientific reports to promote drilling in ANWR is completely in line with an administration rarely encumbered by empirical fact when fiction is more politically expedient. But in the Arctic, it's resonant with a much longer history, one in which misrepresenting the true profits — and costs — of resource use is terribly familiar.
Take the first Arctic oil boom. In the middle of the nineteenth century, this rush was not for petroleum, but whale oil. Commercial hunters from New England killed bowhead whales along the Bering Strait and east into the Beaufort Sea, just a hundred miles or so north of Old Crow. Each ship was financed by investors in New Bedford and Nantucket, rich men who took the largest share of any profit. Industry boosters buoyed investment with reports of new whaling “grounds," despite voyages that grew longer and more hazardous year by year, as whales were hunted to scarcity. For this dangerous work, sailors earned only a small portion of the profit.
The costs of whaling, meanwhile, remained hidden to whale-oil investors and consumers alike, but were very clear in the Arctic. Yupik and Iñupiaq villages along the Alaska coast, where people were as dependent on bowheads as the Gwich'in are on caribou, saw no revenue from commercial whaling. None of the money made from the whales that supported their societies stayed in the north. Instead, their communities were left, after 50 years and the deaths of nearly 20,000 bowheads, with empty seas and starvation. This was the price for mansions in New Bedford.
Or there is the gold rush. Newspapers across the world ran breathless reports of men becoming millionaires in a lucky afternoon a few hundred miles south of Old Crow, at the confluence of the Yukon and Klondike Rivers, alongside ads for mining equipment and transport companies headed north. Tens of thousands of men — and they were mostly men — bought those companies' tickets on the promise of making a fortune by panning gold.
For most, the rush was a bust, the profits flowing not to individuals but to corporations able to finance heavy equipment, companies who, like whaling investors, took their profits far from the Yukon. And money went to men like Donald Trump's grandfather Frederick, who made part of his North American fortune operating a brothel and saloon in the Yukon goldfields. Soothing the dashed hopes of miners was, for most, more profitable than mining itself.
And the cost? Besides ruined finances and deaths of prospectors, gold mining left the area around Dawson City scarred with toxic mine tailings, rerouted streams, and hillsides stripped of trees and weeping soil into rivers. These rivers, already disrupted to their beds by pans and dredges, became less a shelter to salmon and the other fish critical to the Tr'ondëk Hwëch'in, the Indigenous people of the Klondike valley, displaced and dispossessed of their land by the influx of prospectors. Rivers and the people who lived on them were, indirectly, paying for wealth accumulated far away.
Gwich'in communities in Canada and the United States have spent decades trying to keep this history from repeating, to stop siphoning away the wealth in Alaskan oil and leaving the scarred earth and pollution that comes with industrial development. Gwich'in delegates regularly visit Congress to explain the importance of caribou in their lives and of ANWR to the global environment. On Sept. 12, their efforts yielded the passage of a House bill that would prohibit drilling on the coastal plain, an area “so special, so wild, so spectacular," Representative Jared Huffman, a California Democrat, stated, it has “to be off limits to being spoiled by oil and gas development." But now, the issue goes to the Senate, where a bill seems unlikely to garner the necessary support. Meanwhile, the Trump administration moves forward, releasing a report on the envionmental impact of the oil leases.
I have lived in and visited Old Crow for 20 years now. It is both unthinkable and terribly possible that there might be a late August when I visit and there are no caribou to ask after. Unthinkable, because caribou are central to so much in Old Crow. Terribly possible, because Trump's inflated claims about ANWR are of a piece with the history of resource extraction in the Arctic, one replete with lies about potential profits and blindness to real costs. At the core of this history is theft: of land from the Arctic's Indigenous peoples, and wealth from its ecosystems, in the form of whales or clear rivers. But as the Senate prepares to vote on opening leases in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, we still have the option to see the real cost — and the option to not be thieves.

Texto completo: New York Yankees pitcher Domingo Germán has been placed on administrative leave due to the MLB's domestic violence policy, the league announced Thursday.
MLB announced that it will undergo an investigation into Germán, but did not specifically say what his alleged actions are. The specifics of the incident were not announced as the league investigates the situation.
Bob Klapisch of the New York Times reported Thursday afternoon on social media that the incident with Germán involved his girlfriend and occurred between late Monday night and Tuesday morning.
The Yankees released a statement on Thursday in response to MLB's decision.
"We fully support all measures being undertaken by the commissioner's office pursuant to the policy of domestic violence. We support this policy which reinforces that domestic violence has no place in our society and cannot be tolerated. We have followed the lead of Major League Baseball and will continue to provide our complete cooperation throughout the investigative process. We reserve any further comment until the investigation reaches its conclusion. All questions pertaining to this matter should be directed to the office of the commissioner."
Yankees manager Aaron Boone told reporters Thursday afternoon that he learned of Germán's placement on the ride to Yankee Stadium.
"I heard some of the whispers and what not, but this is a Major League Baseball investigation and issue, so we are just trying to be as cooperative as we can while this goes on," Boone said.
It remains a mystery as to whether the Yankees were aware of a pending move by the league regarding Germán. The 27-year-old appeared in Wednesday's 3-2 loss to the Los Angeles Angels, tossing 21/3 scoreless innings in relief. Germán is 18-4 with a 4.03 ERA in 143 innings this season.
"It was vague to me," Boone said about hearing of the incident. Boone said he was not sure he knew if Germán was aware before pitching on Wednesday.
According to Boone, players were not informed of the move by the league before it was announced to the public. When Boone was asked if he knew anything before Wednesday's game, the manager said he could not comment further on an active league investigation.
"It's a Major League issue and we are kind of in a stand down mode," Boone said.
Boone and general manager Brian Cashman will address the team before Thursday night's game regarding the incident.
"I haven't thought of exactly what I'll say," Boone said. "Obviously, this is fresh. I'll get up there and talk as a group and as a family and speak from the heart."
With the move to place Germán on administrative leave, the Yankees brought up right-handed pitcher Michael King to the active roster. Under the administrative leave, Germán cannot have contact with the team while the matter is being investigated.

Texto completo: LANSING – Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson says Michigan will get its first-ever full-time elections security specialist as she tries to ensure the integrity of the 2020 vote.
Ashiya Brown, an audit and database management expert in the Department of Health and Human Services, starts Monday, Benson said.
Election security is a major issue for 2020 after U.S. intelligence agencies determined that the Russian government was behind hacking and covert social media efforts intended to influence the 2016 election in favor of Republican President Donald Trump.
"The security of our elections in Michigan has always been of paramount importance to all of my predecessors, and you've not seen evidence of the types of potential threats that have impacted systems in other states," Benson, a Democrat, said in an interview.
"But that said, the threats to our elections did not end in 2016, and they will continue to evolve, and we must be prepared," she said.
Bureau of Elections spokesman Shawn Starkey said Brown's position is a new one "dedicated to coordinating Michigan's overall election security plan, and working with state and federal partners to assess, train and communicate with our local election officials on election security best practices."
He said Brown's "technical background in managing, assessing and auditing large-scale computer-based systems in the Department of Health and Human Services will ... help to keep Michigan well-positioned to anticipate and respond to potential security threats as we head into a critical election year."
The Senate Intelligence Committee concluded in July that election systems in all 50 states were targeted by Russia in 2016. The New York Times reported in April 2018 that hackers breached election systems in Illinois, a county database in Arizona, a Tennessee state website and an information technology vendor in Florida.
Benson said she is not aware of even an unsuccessful attempt by agents of Russia — or anyone else — to hack into Michigan's Qualified Voter File, which is an electronic statewide voter registration and election management system.
Brown's salary is about $87,600, Starkey said.
Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson has announced an elections security specialist will ensure the integrity of Michigan's 2020 vote.

Texto completo: An obituary on Wednesday about the television reporter Sander Vanocur misstated the subject in which he received a degree from Northwestern University. It was communications, not political science. It also misstated part of the name of one of Mr. Vanocur's employers. It is the Public Broadcasting Service, not System. And it misstated the years of the movie "Dave," in which Mr. Vanocur played a newsman, and "The Kingdom and the Power," Gay Talese's book about The New York Times. The movie was released in 1993, not 1983; the book was published in 1969, not 1966.

Texto completo: As a boy, he met the famed institution's founder, Lillian Wald, and became a benefactor. In midcareer, he traded Wall Street investing for writing short stories and plays.
Richard Abrons, whose destitute, widowed grandmother was rescued by the social reformer Lillian Wald, and who decades later returned the favor by becoming a major benefactor of Wald's Henry Street Settlement, a storied social services agency on the Lower East Side, died on Monday in Manhattan. He was 92.
The cause was kidney failure, his wife, Iris Abrons, said.
An investment manager who later turned to writing short stories and plays, Mr. Abrons and his family underwrote Henry Street's arts classes and college scholarships; expanded its social services, including those for the homeless; helped the settlement acquire what became known as the Boys and Girls Republic community center; and transformed vacant lots adjacent to the settlement's original building into Martin Luther King Jr. Community Park.
He was said to have been the only person to have known every one of Henry Street's executive directors since the settlement was founded.
Lillian Wald, an Ohio native who had moved to Manhattan from upstate New York when she was 22 to study nursing, was in the vanguard of a movement that favored giving the poor the resources to break the cycle of poverty rather than offer them temporary relief.
With fellow social workers, she settled in the Lower East Side to provide health care, education and social services to impoverished immigrants in 1893 and moved to the original building, 265 Henry Street, two years later.
Mr. Abrons was president of the Henry Street Settlement from 1985 to 1995, a board member for 52 years and vice chairman of the board at his death.
He remained a limited partner in First Manhattan Company, an investment firm he had formed with colleagues in 1964, but had gravitated toward a second career as a writer.
In 1991, he earned a master's in fine arts from New York University. He published nearly two dozen short stories and also wrote plays.
Among the stories was "Every Day a Visitor," which appeared in The North American Review and won the National Magazine Fiction Award in 1981. It was published in an anthology called "Every Day a Visitor" in 1996, and was adapted into a play performed by the New Federal Theater company at the McGinn/Cazale Theater in Manhattan in 2001. The characters are residents of a Bronx retirement home who emulate politicians and celebrities.
In a review in The New York Times, Lawrence Van Gelder wrote that the play "strikes a praiseworthy blow for the individuality of the elderly."
"In an effort to rouse themselves from the dispiriting circumstances of their remaining lives," Mr. Van Gelder continued, "these elderly people decide that since they cannot change their retirement home they will empower themselves."
Reviewing Mr. Abrons's comedy "The Brothers Berg," performed at the Here Arts Theater in Lower Manhattan in 2000, Bruce Weber of The Times wrote that the speeches by the character Morris exhibit "a modest gift for the kind of withering self-deprecation and eloquent tactlessness that we've come to associate with unhappy men of letters."
Richard Simon Abrons was born on Nov. 22, 1926, in New Rochelle, N.Y., to Louis and Anne (Schroeder) Abrons. His father was a Russian-born real estate developer. Anne Abrons's mother had been struggling to raise five children when Wald found her a job sewing nurses' uniforms.
Louis Abrons was a member of a Henry Street literary club whose leader, Herbert H. Lehman, the investment banker and governor of New York, would help pay his college tuition.
Richard's parents met in 1905 at a Henry Street dance; Wald and Lehman attended their wedding, and Louis Abrons later became a major benefactor of the settlement house. Richard Abrons worked as a volunteer counselor and swimming teacher at Henry Street's summer camp in the 1940s.
After graduating from Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., he earned a bachelor's degree in psychology from Yale in 1949 and a master's in business administration from Columbia.
His marriage to Mimi Mulwitz in 1950 ended in divorce in 1983. He married Iris Zeeman Schinderman in 1988. In addition to her, he is survived by two sons, Peter and John, and a daughter, Leslie Abrons, all from his first marriage; two stepsons, Andrew and Jay Schinderman; and nine grandchildren. A Manhattan resident, Mr. Abrons died in a hospital there.
Mr. Abrons was active in other institutions, including the Bronx Children's Museum and GrowNYC, an urban farm volunteer group.
In his work for the Henry Street Settlement, he was credited with helping to obtain a founding gift from his sister, Rita Aranow, to establish its Workforce Development Center, a job training and placement program.
And the children of Mr. Abrons and his sister and brother established a fund through the settlement that has granted 530 low-income students more than $ 500,000 in college scholarships since 1998.

After cash is captured in photo, Trump touts himself as a generous tipper

Texto completo: President Trump had a simple explanation for the loose $20 bills jutting out of his back pocket as he boarded Air Force One this week: He's a good tipper.
"I do like leaving tips at the hotel. You know, I like to carry a little something," he told reporters aboard the plane Wednesday when asked about the money captured in a shot by a Reuters photographer. "Maybe a president is not supposed to do it, but I like to leave a tip at the hotel, et cetera, et cetera."
For Trump - who has responded to accusations that he profits from the presidency by claiming that he is instead losing billions - the explanation was met with a predictable mix of praise, skepticism and surprise.
"I'm sure the haters will enjoy making fun, but I've personally witnessed @realDonaldTrump tip basically everyone in existence while playing golf, eating meals etc.," Doug Stafford, chief political strategist for Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), tweeted Thursday. "It is a nice gesture that I'm quite positive is not often done by people in anywhere near his position."
Former White House aide Omarosa Manigault Newman said her experience with Trump, dating back to 2003, was quite different.
"I have never seen Donald Trump tip," said Manigault Newman, who had a falling out with the president after she was fired last year. "I can honestly tell you, I've never seen him tip."
The episode on Air Force One stands out as a rare instance in which Trump revealed something new about his personal habits, telling reporters that he doesn't carry a wallet or credit cards and instead keeps a loose wad of cash in his back pocket for tipping purposes. Presidents have long been scrutinized over how they treat the servers, waiters and maids they come across, as voters analyze the brief interactions between the country's most powerful person and the low-wage workers they represent.
Whether presidents leave a tip - and how much they give - is often viewed as a tangible signal of how they view the country's working class.
There's some evidence that Trump's willingness to occasionally hand out cash to his employees existed long before he became president.
Workers at Trump's golf clubs - including many undocumented immigrants - have said Trump handed out tips from $20 to $200 to employees he encountered as a businessman. The housekeepers who cleaned Trump's villa at his Bedminster golf course in New Jersey noted that he kept stacks of $20, $50 and $100 bills on his nightstand for that purpose.
In 2016, Trump's former butler at his Mar-a-Lago resort told the New York Times that Trump would regularly take out a wad of cash from his pocket and give $100 bills to his groundskeepers.
"You're a Hispanic and you're in here trimming the trees and everything, and a guy walks up and hands you a hundred dollars," said the butler, Anthony Senecal. "And they love him, not for that, they just love him."
White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham, who worked on Trump's campaign, said Trump made sure to leave a tip behind at the hotels where he stayed in 2016.
"I remember when I was on the campaign he was always diligent about tipping housekeeping staff at hotels and it struck me how considerate that was," Grisham said.
But evidence of the president's miserliness also abounds.
Over the years, several contractors have sued him for not paying them, a business strategy Trump proudly touted in his 1987 book, "The Art of the Deal."
"You have to be very rough and very tough with most contractors or they'll take the shirt right off your back," Trump wrote in the book.
Trump's longtime personal driver, Noel Cintron, filed a lawsuit against Trump's company last year alleging he was owed more than $200,000 in unpaid overtime wages. Cintron said he worked for Trump for more than 20 years and received a raise only twice. He alleged in the lawsuit that he worked more than 3,000 overtime hours for which he was not paid. The Trump Organization denied any wrongdoing, saying last year that Cintron was paid generously for his services.
Timothy O'Brien, a Trump biographer and executive editor of Bloomberg Opinion who is critical of the president, said Trump may have become more generous over time.
"Among hotel workers in Atlantic City, back when he was running things down there, he was considered a cheap tipper," O'Brien said. "I've heard, anecdotally, that in his later years, at some of the hotels he operates in D.C. and New York, he's become a more generous tipper."
The president's critics say that even if he leaves tips to help individual workers, his broader policy agenda is harmful to those trying to make ends meet. For example, Trump has opposed raising the federal minimum wage, and last year his Labor Department proposed a regulation to allow restaurant owners to pocket the tips of their workers.
Seeking to boost public awareness of Trump's tipping practices, the Trump campaign blasted out a tweet Thursday highlighting news coverage of the president's comments.
Former president Barack Obama's tipping also garnered media interest. In 2013, Obama left a 52 percent tip while dining at an Upstate New York diner, according to the website TMZ, which obtained a copy of the receipt.
Trump seemed to be in a good mood Wednesday aboard Air Force One as he talked to reporters about his tipping. He was enamored by the photo that captured the $20 bills peeking out of his back pocket as the wind whipped up his suit jacket.
"I do! I do!" Trump said when asked if he regularly carries cash. He took a wad of bills out of his pocket showed it to reporters.
"Boy, that's a good picture," he said. "Hey, I'd like a piece of that picture."

Texto completo: Today is Thursday, Sept. 19, the 262nd day of 2019. There are 103 days left in the year.
Today’s highlight in history
On Sept. 19, 2008, struggling to stave off financial catastrophe, the Bush administration laid out a radical bailout plan calling for a takeover of a half-trillion dollars or more in worthless mortgages and other bad debt held by tottering institutions. Relieved investors sent stocks soaring on Wall Street and around the globe.
Today in Wyoming history
In 1900, the Wild Bunch robs the First National Bank in Winnemucca, Nevada. – From “On This Day in Wyoming History” by Patrick T. Holscher
In 1930, an open house is held at Gillette’s new hospital, Dr. Sayles’ home. – From the Wyoming State Historical Society
On this date
In 1777, the first Battle of Saratoga was fought during the Revolutionary War; although British forces succeeded in driving out the American troops, the Americans prevailed in a second battle the following month.
In 1881, James A. Garfield, the United States’ 20th president, died 21/2 months after being shot by Charles Guiteau; Chester Alan Arthur became president.
In 1934, Bruno Hauptmann was arrested in New York and charged with the kidnap-murder of 20-month-old Charles A. Lindbergh Jr.
In 1982, the smiley emoticon was invented by Carnegie Mellon University professor Scott E. Fahlman, who suggested punctuating humorously intended computer messages with a colon followed by a hyphen and a parenthesis as a horizontal “smiley face.” :-)
In 1986, federal health officials announced that the experimental drug AZT would be made available to thousands of AIDS patients.
In 1995, The New York Times and The Washington Post published the manifesto of Unabomber Ted Kaczynski, which proved instrumental in identifying and capturing him.
In 1996, IBM announced it would extend health benefits to the partners of its gay employees.
In 2001, The Pentagon ordered dozens of advanced aircraft to the Persian Gulf region as the hour of military retaliation for deadly terrorist attacks on Sept. 11 drew closer.
Ten years ago: Russia said it would scrap a plan to deploy missiles near Poland after Washington dumped a planned missile shield in Eastern Europe. Art Ferrante, 88, half of the piano duo Ferrante and Teicher, died in Longboat Key, Florida. (Lou Teicher had died in 2008 at age 83.)
Five years ago: President Barack Obama signed legislation authorizing the military to arm and train moderate Syrian rebels fighting Islamic State militants in the Middle East. Shortly after President Obama and his daughters left the White House by helicopter, a man with a knife jumped the fence and made it into the presidential residence before being tackled. (Omar Gonzalez, an Army veteran with mental health issues, was later sentenced to 17 months in prison.)
One year ago: President Donald Trump visited North and South Carolina to survey the wreckage left by Hurricane Florence. Wanda Barzee, who had helped her then-husband kidnap Utah teen Elizabeth Smart 15 years earlier, was released from prison.
Thought for today
“Do not let yourself be tainted with a barren skepticism.” – Louis Pasteur, French scientist (1822-1895).

Texto completo: We keep hearing that print is dead.
But every year since 2013, the Lancaster Printers Fair has proven just how untrue that is.
The event, which celebrates printing and letterpress in particular, gets bigger and more popular every year.
“In many ways, print is seeing a resurgence,” says Henry Gepfer, a printer and teacher who is helping organize this year’s related art exhibits. “It’s rooted in the idea that we are so digitally saturated, people want something hand drawn.”
“The printers fair is the largest of its kind on the East Coast,” says Ken Kulakowsky, president of the .918 Club, which organizes the fair. “The fair is a wonderful way to witness history and the future at the same time. Letterpress and other forms of printing are widely popular and examples can be seen everywhere in society.”
The Lancaster Printers Fair will be held from 6 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. Friday and from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday.
Friday’s events include the showing of “Pressing On: The Letterpress Movie,” a documentary about how letterpress has survived the computer age. The film introduces a number of people who work in printing and have kept the art alive.
The New York Times calls the film “A salve for technological oversaturation. ... There is some discussion of the history of the technique, but the focus is on eccentric characters whose passion keeps the form alive.”
The film will be shown at the Candy Factory, 342 N. Queen St.
The Heritage Press Museum at 346 N. Queen St. will be offering demonstrations in printing
And three locations will feature print exhibits both Friday and Saturday.
“This is an opportunity to show the depth and breadth of print making,” Gepfer says.
At Realm and Reason, 213 W. King St., the work of Martin Mazorra will be on display.
“He is showing prints of flowers, the language of flowers and floral life,” Gepfer says.
“(Mazorra) is really deft with his hands. He’s using a technique called rainbow roll, which allows you to print multiple colors at the same time,” Gepfer explains.
At the Pennsylvania Guild of Craftsmen, 335 N. Queen St., Rebecca Blosser will be showing her work.
“I’m not sure what she will be showing, but her work is very much about place and structure,” Gepfer says.
And at Madcap and Company, 310 N. Queen St., Angela Heaps, a printer from Philadelphia, will be exhibiting sculptures, or more specifically, pulp sculptures, which are made from paper that is beaten through a water process.
“You can use a slightly roughed up piece of paper for sculpture, and when it dries, add adhesive to hold it together,” Gepfer says. “You can make paper pulp casts or do freehand. It’s very versatile.”
On Saturday, the 300 block of North Queen Street will become a street fair, with vendors selling a wide variety of print fare. Demonstrations will be happening and food trucks will be nearby.
The street will be closed to traffic. All the shops will remain open and a beer garden will be provided by Voodoo Brewing Co.
And all-day parking passes to the North Queen Street garage will be available for $5.
In the middle of it all will be a huge tent.
“We’ll have an informal show under the tent,” Gepfer says. There will be Lancaster printers and quite a few pieces will be from students. It’s a show with a little less pressure and an opportunity for visibility. ”
Some of the work will be traditional while some will be pushing the envelope.
“There are always new processes to wrap your head around,” Gepfer says. “Digital technologies are becoming involved in printmaking. “I think we have plenty of miles ahead of us.”¶

Texto completo: Modern conservatives hate regulation, and the Trump administration has channeled that hatred into policy. It has scrapped or emasculated rules designed to limit everything from predatory lending to exploitative for-profit education, and has moved on multiple fronts to undo environmental protection. On Wednesday, it took perhaps its most dramatic anti-regulation step so far, announcing that it would try to prevent California from setting strict rules on auto emissions.
But what’s behind this hatred of regulation? You might think that it’s all about profits, that corporations want to be free to pollute and rip off their customers because it’s good for the bottom line. In fact, however, the striking thing about many of Donald Trump’s deregulatory moves is that major corporations actually oppose his actions.
No, there’s something happening here that goes beyond big money trying to get even bigger. Trump, I’d argue, is tapping into a grass-roots phenomenon — let’s call it regulation rage — that is more about psychology than about self-interest. It’s a syndrome that only afflicts a minority of the population, but it’s real, it’s ugly, and it can do a remarkable amount of damage.
What do I mean by regulation rage? It’s the startling anger evoked by government rules intended to protect the public, even when those rules aren’t especially onerous and the public interest case for the rules is overwhelming.
I think I first became aware of regulation rage back in the 1980s, when a local Massachusetts talk-radio host led a temporarily successful jihad against the state’s seatbelt law. (The state reinstated the law after its repeal led to a surge in traffic fatalities.)
However, the phenomenon really came into focus for me a decade ago, when I read a rant by the right-wing commentator Erick Erickson suggesting that government officials should face violent retribution for their actions: “At what point do the people tell the politicians to go to hell? At what point do they get off the couch, march down to their state legislator’s house, pull him outside, and beat him to a bloody pulp for being an idiot?”
What was the policy that set Erickson off? Washington state’s ban on phosphates in detergents. Phosphates are a real environmental menace, which can help cause toxic algae blooms.
Regulation rage has a couple of distinctive features. One is its disproportionality, in which fairly mild restrictions set off volcanic anger. The other is the sheer pettiness of many of the ragers’ complaints.
Do people remember Trump’s opposition to regulations that protect the ozone layer because, he claimed, his hair spray wasn’t working as well as it used to?
So what’s really driving regulation rage? I’d love to see some serious political science research into the phenomenon. I suspect, though I don’t know for sure, that there are strong correlations between regulation rage and other attitudes, like support for unregulated gun sales and racial hostility.
But as I said, regulation rage seems to be more about psychology than about self-interest. It’s coming from people who, for whatever reason, don’t feel respected, and who see even mild restrictions on their actions as insults perpetrated by elites who consider themselves smarter than other people.

Slavery's legacy

Texto completo: There’s a problem with the idea that the legacy of slavery in America is the major deterrent today to social and economic progress by black Americans. And it’s being ignored as the New York Times and others seek to redefine America’s history as having been shaped more by slavery than any other factor.
A number of historians reject this idea while recognizing that slavery and segregation have played a powerful role in holding back advancement by blacks.
But Thomas Sowell, the famous black economist, makes a compelling case that it’s no longer the legacy of slavery that is most harmful to blacks. Rather, it’s the legacy of liberalism and the welfare state that are to blame.
“If we wanted to be serious about evidence, we might compare where blacks stood a hundred years after the end of slavery with where they stood after 30 years of the liberal welfare state,” Sowell wrote in 2014. “In other words, we could compare hard evidence on ‘the legacy of slavery’ with hard evidence on the legacy of liberals."
“Despite the grand myth that black economic progress began or accelerated with the passage of the civil rights laws and the ‘war on poverty’ programs, the cold fact is that the poverty rate among blacks fell from 87 percent in 1940 to 47 percent by 1960,” he wrote. “This was before any of those programs began."
Those years were marked by blacks acting without government assistance. Hundreds of thousands of Southern blacks migrated to the North, where they found jobs and better schools.
“Over the next 20 years, the poverty rate among blacks fell another 18 percentage points … This was a continuation of a previous economic trend, at a slower rate or progress, not the economic grand deliverance proclaimed by liberals and self-serving black ‘leaders.’”
Sowell has been a senior fellow at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution since 1980. He retired recently from writing a nationally syndicated column. He’s written more than two dozen books on a wide range of subjects, including race, economics, immigration, ethnic groups, and late-talking children.
He says liberals have difficulty coming to grips with the failure of their programs. “They simply cannot look at the evidence and say, ‘My God, we made things worse,’” he said on Hoover colleague Peter Robinson’s radio show, Uncommon Knowledge.
Sowell has questioned the effect of the legacy of slavery in the 21st century. “Whether it is the dearth of marriages and the family among contemporary blacks or their lower labor force participation than whites, or their higher crime rates, slavery has often been invoked as an explanation,” he wrote in his 2005 book, Black Rednecks and White Liberals.
“Yet the fact is that in the late nineteenth century, when blacks were just one generation out of slavery, there was nothing like today’s levels of unwed births or failure to participate in the labor force,” he wrote. “It has been from the 1960s onward that these social pathologies have escalated. Whatever the cause, it has arisen long after slavery had ended.”
The marriage and family data Sowell cites are striking. In 1960, 78% of black children were being raised in two-parent families. “But thirty years after the liberal welfare state found the great majority of black children being raised by a single parent (66 percent),” he wrote in 2014.
Both a “precipitous decline” in black marriage rates and a “sharp increases in premarital first births began in the 1960s,” Sowell wrote in the 2005 book. “From 1930 to 1934, 31 percent of first births to black women were premarital, while from 1990 to 1994, 77 percent were … That such a ‘legacy of slavery’ would take nearly a century to appear strains credulity.”
For now, Sowell is a voice in the wilderness on the lack of relevance of the legacy of slavery in 2019. There’s a difference between him and promoters of the legacy of slavery. It’s the difference between evidence and politics.
Fred Barnes, a Washington Examiner senior columnist, was a founder and executive editor of the Weekly Standard.

What Planned Parenthood's treatment of Leana Wen reveals about the abortion giant

Texto completo: Planned Parenthood claims to stand for all of women’s reproductive choices, but more than once the nation’s largest abortion provider has been accused of mistreating its pregnant employees. It seems that the recently fired and now pregnant former president is no exception, as Planned Parenthood appears to be trying to bully Leana Wen into silence.
The New York Times has reported that the abortion corporation is withholding Wen’s health insurance and severance pay unless she signs a confidentiality agreement, an action Wen has rightly called “unjust” and “unethical.” Planned Parenthood’s attempt to violate the terms of Wen’s employment contract has proven once again that they are not a women’s healthcare organization, but a corporation that values abortion above all else.
This attempt to enforce a gag rule on Wen comes with an ironic twist. At the same time, Planned Parenthood has alleged that the Trump Administration’s new Title X rules have placed a gag rule upon them. Planned Parenthood recently chose to withdraw from the federal program rather than separate their healthcare services from their abortion business, and they had to suffer the loss of $60 million in taxpayer dollars as a consequence. The decision to prioritize abortion over healthcare in this case is similar to the reasons surrounding Wen’s departure from Planned Parenthood. She had attempted to shift the organization’s focus away from abortion and toward healthcare, and that led to her firing.
Wen has since revealed that within the national staff and board members at Planned Parenthood “is a vocal minority who prefer a stridently political, abortion-first philosophy.” In a direct violation of their contractual obligations, Planned Parenthood is attempting to take “away [Wen’s] voice as a public health expert” by forcing her to sign a gag clause, suppressing any future statements from the former president that would expose Planned Parenthood’s abortion-minded agenda. Through their senior vice president of communications, Melanie Newman, the abortion provider has attempted to further dismiss Wen’s claims by labeling them as “unfortunate, saddening, and simply untrue.”
Claiming that the attorneys representing the board have treated Wen “amicably,” Newman has insisted that attempts are being made to reach “a suitable resolution regarding [Wen’s] exit package.” However, Wen is not the first Planned Parenthood president to be fired for attempting to shift the corporation’s focus away from abortion. Pamela J. Maraldo was forced to resign years ago when the board feared Maraldo was “more interested in managed care than in being Planned Parenthood.” Wen is also not the first pregnant employee that Planned Parenthood has treated abysmally.
An exposé in The New York Times revealed that the management of some Planned Parenthood clinics views “accommodating expecting mothers as expensive and inconvenient. Others were unsympathetic to workers seeking special treatment.” Since 2013, dozens of lawsuits have been filed against Planned Parenthood clinics in federal and state courts, accusing managers of “denying workers rest periods, lunch breaks or overtime pay, or retaliating against them for taking medical leave.”
Other reports revealed cases where managers denied pregnant staffers requests for frequent breaks, even if the request was backed up by a doctor’s note. Details of other reported incidents involved staff members being fired weeks after giving birth, or being dismissed the day after returning from maternity leave. Now, Planned Parenthood is refusing to pay for a pregnant Wen’s health insurance, even though their abrupt termination of her employment requires them to do so.
With their former president becoming the latest victim of their reported pregnancy discrimination, Planned Parenthood has proven once again that abortion is their main priority. While she has still maintained her pro-abortion position, the treatment Wen has received has validated reports of Planned Parenthood’s unethical behavior. Their attempt to blackmail Wen into silence has caused Planned Parenthood to unwittingly reveal the pro-life movement has been correct about them all along.
Planned Parenthood is not an organization that supports women throughout all of their pregnancy decisions, but an abortion corporation that profits from the deaths of over 300,000 unborn babies a year.

Texto completo: South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson has joined 23 states in agreeing to a proposed, multibillion-dollar settlement with the maker of OxyContin, a highly addictive painkiller that has fueled America's opioid crisis.
The deal — already facing challenges from a group of other states that say it is too soft on Purdue Pharma and its owners, the Sackler family — seeks to settle more than 2,600 state and federal lawsuits against the Stamford, Connecticut-based company.
The settlement, which hinges on Purdue's Sunday night Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing, would see the Sacklers give up ownership of the company and allow it to transform into a "public benefit trust."
If the settlement is approved by a federal judge, the Sacklers reportedly would have to pay $3 billion in cash to the lawsuits' plaintiffs over seven years.
Purdue would continue selling opioids in the U.S. and elsewhere. But the future profits of those drug sales would pay off plaintiffs who sued the company and fund the research and development of drugs to treat addiction and overdoses, according to the New York Times.
Wilson's office confirmed Tuesday afternoon that South Carolina was among the 24 states and five U.S. territories that have signed onto the settlement. Those states, including Tennessee and Florida, like the settlement because it avoids additional costly litigation and produces money that can be used to fight opioid addiction.
"Our lawsuit seeks to hold accountable Purdue Pharma for their deceptive marketing of prescription opioids such as OxyContin, which fueled the opioid epidemic in South Carolina," Wilson said in a statement. "The bankruptcy was expected and is part of a settlement framework which will put one of the worst actors responsible for the opioid epidemic in our country out of business, not only in the United States, but worldwide. It will take every penny from Purdue Pharma assets and billions from the Sackler family personally.
"Our focus all along has been to put an end to Purdue Pharma's deceptive practices to secure resources we need to fight this epidemic. With this settlement framework, we have done that without the delay of protracted litigation and its associated costs."
The settlement is sure to be contested by other states, including neighboring North Carolina, which say the deal lets the Sacklers off easy and will wind up providing less than the $10 billion estimated by the company in its bankruptcy filing.
The settlement allows the Sacklers to continue running British-based Mundipharma until that drug company is sold, according to the New York Times. It also requires the Sacklers to pay only $3 billion of the total settlement, allowing the rest to be paid from future opioid sales even as local and state governments work to combat the opioid crisis.
"The Sackler family sucked billions of dollars out of Purdue and is now throwing the carcass of this drug company into bankruptcy," North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein said, according to the Associated Press.
Prescription painkillers and illegal opioids such as heroin and fentanyl have been blamed for more than 400,000 deaths in the United States over the past 20 years, according to the Associated Press.
That includes 749 opioid overdose deaths in South Carolina in 2017, according to the National Institute of Drug Abuse. That was up from fewer than 100 opioid overdoses in South Carolina in 2000, data show.
Republican Gov. Henry McMaster declared the opioid epidemic a statewide public health emergency in December 2017.
Asked about Wilson's decision, a spokesman for McMaster said, "As an attorney and former Attorney General, the governor isn't inclined to talk about the specifics of a case he isn't directly involved with, but he does have confidence in the Attorney General Wilson's judgement."
After a legal fight between the settlement's supporters and opponents, a federal bankruptcy judge will decide whether to approve or reject the settlement or order revisions to it.
It is unclear how much money South Carolina would get from the settlement.
The 24 states who have signed onto the deal are Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, West Virginia and Wyoming.
The five U.S. territories who support the deal are American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
Two dozen other states are either opposed to the settlement or uncommitted to signing it, according to Reuters.
The company that made billions selling OxyContin has filed for bankruptcy protection. This comes after it reached a tentative settlement with many governments.

Texto completo: Louisiana journalist and political historian Robert Mann says he writes books about politics because it's what he knows best. And does he know politics.
Since his days as a political reporter for the former Shreveport Journal to his work for three U.S. senators and a Louisiana governor, he has developed as a political expert, sought for his opinions and perspective.
Those experiences, he says, have helped him get into the minds of politicians for the seven books he's written. "I don't think that's the only way to write well about politics, but it's always helped me," he says.
His fascinating new book is "Becoming Ronald Reagan: The Rise of A Conservative Icon," due out Oct. 1 from Potomac Books and available for pre-order online.
Mann, a member of the Louisiana Political Hall of Fame, has come up with a unique look at Reagan and how he changed from a liberal actor to a conservative politician. "I think I've documented Reagan's political evolution in a way no one else has," he says.
How the book unfolded:
"I started out to write a book about Reagan's famous 'A Time for Choosing' speech that he gave on national television in Oct. 1964 for Barry Goldwater. The speech was so well received that Reagan—at the time still a politically active actor—was propelled into the 1966 California's governor's race, which he won."
Mann thought that speech and its genesis would make a great story. "What I discovered, however, was a better story about how Reagan got to that decisive moment. In other words, how did this once-liberal actor become a conservative icon? That's the story of my book: Reagan's political evolution in the 1950s and early 1960s."
A different look:
"Most Reagan biographies have a chapter or two about this period of his life. My book is the first to comprehensively explore this period. I am also the first Reagan biographer to make use of small-town newspaper articles which, before now, have been almost impossible to track down...Among the most valuable resources were hundreds of newspaper stories I found throughout the 50s and 60s, which describe in detail what Reagan was saying to audiences as he traveled the country as a goodwill ambassador for General Electric."
Shreveport pops up:
"There's a little bit of Shreveport in this book. I write about how local radio stations twice—in 1958 and in 1962—broadcast, in their entirety, speeches that Reagan gave to area organizations."
And Mann quotes a Shreveport Times story about Reagan's Dec. 1958 appearance in the area: "...His face is so familiar from 50 movies which brought him celluloid fame and—more lately—from General Electric's Sunday night television show. It's like listening to your next door neighbor campaigning for less bureaucracy and lower taxes."
Surprises along the way:
"The biggest surprise was how much I ended up liking Reagan. I voted for him twice in my twenties, but gravitated away from my conservative roots. In the ensuing years, I'd learned to have a healthy disdain for him and his policies. The research on the book didn't change my mind about his politics so much, but I discovered that he was an enormously compelling and likeable person. I now think of him like many of my friends, neighbors and family members with whom I disagree on politics but still enjoy their company."
Another tidbit: "I was also surprised to learn that Reagan was so much more well read than I imagined. In the 50s and early 60s, he was afraid to fly. He took trains everywhere, which gave him lots of time to read and think. On those long trips, he devoured books and he wrote his own speeches. He had a much more robust intellectual life than many people, including some of his biggest fans, realize."
Writing about differing views:
"When I write these books, I try to put my personal feelings about my subjects to the side. I believe my books about Lyndon Johnson, for example, were quite tough on him, particularly his record in Vietnam. I tried to be dispassionate and feel I achieved that, to the point that I learned to like Reagan in a way that I never expected."
More about the author:
Mann, who lives in Baton Rouge, holds the Manship Chair at the Manship School of Mass Communication at Louisiana State University, and is the author of six critically acclaimed political histories of the U.S. civil rights movement, the Vietnam War, American wartime dissent and the 1964 presidential election. The Washington Post named his book "Daisy Petals and Mushroom Clouds: LBJ, Barry Goldwater, and the Ad that Changed American Politics" among the best political books of 2011.
His essays and reviews have appeared in numerous publications, including the New York Times, Politico, Salon, Vox, and Smithsonian magazine. Mann teaches courses in political communication and is editor of the Media & Public Affairs book series, published jointly by the Manship School and LSU Press.
He was communications director to Louisiana Gov. Kathleen Blanco, after serving 19 years as a U.S. Senate aide. He was state director to U.S. Sen. John Breaux and served as Breaux's press secretary. He also served as press secretary to U.S. Sen. Russell Long. He was press secretary for the 1990 re-election campaign of U.S. Sen. J. Bennett Johnston, the 1992 and 1998 Breaux re-election campaigns and the 2003 Blanco campaign.
Mann is a politics watcher I've followed through the years, and my respect for his knowledge goes back to the 1980s and my days as a political reporter and young editor for The Shreveport Times. One of my memories includes Mann setting up a dinner with another political icon, Russell Long, at the University Club in downtown Shreveport. To be honest, I can't recall the political issues the three of us talked about but instead vividly remember Long's amusement with the classic 1967 movie "The Producers" that he had just watched on television and his delight at being given a chilled fork for his salad. I'm sure Mann has hundreds of such stories.

The hardback retails for $29.95, and the book will also be available in e-book and audio formats. Mann will discuss the book at the Louisiana Book Festival on Nov. 2.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The photograph has all the trappings of a Renaissance painting -- crowded with characters, action and emotion -- only this one is set in a congressional hearing room and features figures frequently found on C-Span.
It captures a small moment in a big event: The first hearing by the House Judiciary Committee officially called to determine whether to impeach President Trump. But to look at the frame, captured on Tuesday by Doug Mills, a New York Times photographer, is to understand something deeper about the forces at play as the House grapples with the prospect of trying to remove Mr. Trump.
We decided to give it a close reading.
At the center of it all
1. Chairman Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York
Mr. Nadler, a long-serving progressive from Manhattan, is literally in the middle of the impeachment debate -- not just between the Republicans and Democrats seen here, but between competing factions of his own party. Mr. Nadler and most of his fellow Democrats on the committee have become increasingly outspoken about their support for "vindicating the Constitution" through an impeachment vote, but moderates in the party remain deeply skeptical, and Speaker Nancy Pelosi has publicly downplayed the effort.
The photograph documents a tense scene during the panel's questioning of Corey Lewandowski, Mr. Trump's former campaign manager, who Democrats believe may hold a key to proving that the president obstructed justice. At issue is whether House rules allow a consultant working for the Democrats to directly question Mr. Lewandowski.
As Mr. Nadler leans back his chair, an intense debate unfolds around him even after he overruled Republicans' objection to a prominent defense lawyer questioning Mr. Lewandowski, and then quickly dispatched with their attempts to shut down the hearing.
His broader goal is to try to methodically fight back opposition to build a case for the public that Mr. Trump obstructed justice, abused his power and profited from his office. As he sees it, Tuesday's hearing, like others before it, may have been chaotic and given the witness a platform to blast Democrats, but it also allowed his committee to demonstrate before rolling television cameras that Mr. Trump had tried to obstruct the special counsel investigation, and is now working to thwart the committee's own.
hand outstretched
2. Representative Doug Collins, Republican of Georgia
Hunched over, thrusting a small sheaf of papers across the frame, Mr. Collins has initiated this particular fight, grinding the proceedings to a halt. In his hand is a copy of the contract for Barry H. Berke, an experienced white-collar defense lawyer, to serve as a consultant to the committee. Mr. Collins, a fast-talking conservative, is arguing that Mr. Berke is not a full committee employee, and therefore ineligible to question witnesses under the rules.
In this case, as in most other conflicts Republicans provoke over terms and rules, they want to portray Mr. Nadler and Democrats as running roughshod over congressional norms in a political campaign hellbent on destroying Mr. Trump. If they can help muddle the case Democrats are trying to build, all the better.
"Under the circumstances of the current so-called impeachment inquiry, it would constitute an unprecedented privatization of impeachment," Mr. Collins said of Mr. Berke's participation. He added, "If it's win at all costs, Mr. Chairman, then we have a problem."
Hand aloft, in a "Cool it" gesture
3. Representative Zoe Lofgren, Democrat of California
Ms. Lofgren is a crucial member of the committee's brain trust. She served as a Democratic staff member for the panel during the impeachment investigation of President Richard M. Nixon and was a member herself when the committee voted to recommend impeaching President Bill Clinton.
This time, though, she has made no secret of her reservations about Democrats' case and the wisdom of pursuing an impeachment strictly along partisan lines.
She also serves as the head of the House Administration Committee, and, as such, is stepping in as something of an arbiter to this rules dispute. As far as her committee is concerned, she said, it is well within the rules for Mr. Berke to ask questions.
at mr. nadler's right hand
4. Barry H. Berke, a Democratic lawyer for the committee
Mr. Berke is the subject of the particular fight playing out here. A partner at the New York firm Kramer Levin with strong connections to Democrats (he once represented Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York in a federal investigation into the mayor's campaign fund-raising), Mr. Berke was hired by Mr. Nadler last winter to help the committee shape its investigative work. . Up until Tuesday, he had labored mostly behind the scenes. The stage was set for him to take a more prominent role last week when the committee approved new procedures governing its impeachment investigation including allowing for staff lawyers to question witnesses directly after lawmakers have had their turns.
Mr. Berke's rapid-fire cross-examination of Mr. Lewandowski, when it finally commenced, drew widespread praise and highlighted just how choppy and unproductive the typical questioning by lawmakers in hearings like these can be. Most notably, Mr. Berke was able to force the hearing's sharp-tongued witness to admit he had been less than truthful about his involvement with the special counsel in national television interviews.
"I have no obligation not to be dishonest to the media because they are as dishonest as anybody else," Mr. Lewandowski said.
The supporting cast
5. Committee staff
A very small army of professional staff members stand behind elected officials in any congressional proceeding. In this case, a mix of Democratic and Republican aides who specialize in investigations and committee rules are advising the lawmakers on the finer points of their debate. Pressed against their chests or tightly rolled in their hands are legal papers and procedural documents that undergird the committee's work. When they aren't embroiled in mid-hearing flare-ups like this one, they help craft strategy, write speeches, draft scripts for questioning witnesses and attempt to keep the business of the committee on track.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi
As the Democrats' leader, Ms. Pelosi overshadows the entire debate, quietly approving every move Mr. Nadler has made even as she tends to the tricky politics of impeachment in a party that is deeply divided over the issue. As the Judiciary Committee has intensified its talk of impeaching the president, Ms. Pelosi has maintained the skeptical stance she adopted months ago when she said doing so was "just not worth it." Though she has not ruled it out entirely, she argues the House has not yet built a strong enough case, and must stay its current course of investigating and fighting the president in court.
The tensions between Ms. Pelosi, Mr. Nadler and the Judiciary Committee have increasingly spilled into public since Congress returned from summer recess last week. Though she has signed off on each of the panel's actions, she has pointedly declined to use the phrase "impeachment investigation," and in one private meeting last week, first reported by Politico, she took a thinly veiled swipe at the committee and its staff for pushing too aggressively on the process given that some Democrats are not yet sold on it, according to people familiar with her remarks. Supporters of impeachment fear she is trying to sow confusion to justify not going down that road.

Corey Lewandowski
Try as Democrats might, they struggled at points on Tuesday to keep the focus on their witness and the story he had to tell about Mr. Trump's attempts to enlist him in mid-2017 to drastically curtail the Russia investigation. Mr. Lewandowski, a pugnacious loyalist of Mr. Trump's who is considering a Senate run in New Hampshire, was never going to make it easy. He dodged questions based on orders from the White House, taunted Democrats in the hearing room and, even as he confirmed key details about possible obstruction of justice, declared the president had never asked him to do a "anything illegal."
Though Mr. Lewandowski is the first fact witness to show up for public testimony before the Judiciary panel, his blockade was part of a larger White House effort to stonewall the committee's work. It has repeatedly intervened to direct former officials at the center of the case not to testify and slow-walked the production of documents, making it far more difficult for Democrats to create the kind of vivid hearings that could generate more public interest.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

1619 AND REFRAMING AMERICAN HISTORY

Texto completo: It’s hard to hear the truth, especially when it flies in the face of stories you have been told since you were born. The truth can shock a person, usually leaving them with one of two choices — either defend the status quo or be open to additional facts.
The New York Times’ 1619 Project is taking America on a truth-seeking mission. Marking the 400th anniversary of the first slave ship docking on Virginia’s shores, the collection of essays reveal that the story we learned in school, in public life, and even in mainstream media omits many important facts.
As readers turn the pages, they are confronted with a raw, unfiltered and honest discussion about the true origins of the United States of America, not the romanticized version of American history we grew up with. This story, one of brutality, injustice and resiliency is far more difficult to embrace.
Our country is now, finally, beginning to engage in a debate — a debate about what America truly is, who it belongs to, and what it ought to be. By providing a full, unvarnished record of our collective history — including details that are often left from the history books — Nikole Hannah Jones and the authors of the 1619 Project push this debate forward.
For example, how many Americans know that in 1831 the United States produced nearly half of the world’s cotton — all picked by slaves? How many know that the bodies of these men, women and children were used as collateral for mortgages and other loans? Those bodies literally built wealth for white families and American industries, wealth that was passed down through generations.
This information is critical when trying to better understand the stark racial wealth gap that exists in America today, a direct result of 400 years of systematic inequality compounded to build white wealth while blocking most African-Americans from gaining a financial foothold.
Here’s the truth — we have a lot of work to do in order to better understand our collective history. It’s not going to be easy, because our past is not pristine. It’s full of unimaginable violence and harm, but it’s ours, and despite its ugliness our nation has undoubtedly made progress.
We’ve progressed in large part because of the contributions and sacrifices made by African Americans. We can no longer deny this fact, nor can we continue to deny African-Americans’ humanity and their unmeasurable contributions to this country. African Americans are just as American as white Americans and their experiences must be taught, learned and entrenched in American hearts and minds.
The essayists expose the reader to important facts consistently left out of our traditional historical framework — namely, that our country’s wealth and power rest at the feet of African-Americans. Our bodies, our continual fight for equal rights, our innovation and creativity, our commitment to the core values of democracy, should all be an intrinsic part of Americans’ understanding of our nation’s history. Despite all the atrocities and injustice, black Americans continue to show up.
Holding these truths as self-evident, as part of our collective past, is the only way to move toward that more perfect union. The truth will set us free, but only if we listen to it.
Danyelle Solomon is vice president of race and ethnicity policy at the Center for American Progress. She wrote this for InsideSources.com.

Texto completo: The Sackler family, owner of OxyContin-maker Purdue Pharma, is behind the recent $6.8 million purchase of a rehabbed downtown West Palm Beach office building, The Palm Beach Post has learned.
The July 31 purchase of the Glidden Spina + Partners building for a Sackler family office took place less than two months before Purdue Pharma filed Chapter 11, in a bid to resolve 2,600 opioid lawsuits pending against the company.
Florida and Palm Beach County are among numerous states and municipalities nationwide suing Connecticut-based Purdue Pharma for its role in the opioid crisis, which has resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths and torment for families across the country.
The Glidden Spina deal, which raised eyebrows in the real estate community for its high price, also took place before the New York Attorney General’s Office said on Sept. 13 that it had tracked about $1 billion in
wire transfers by the Sackler family, including through Swiss bank accounts.
A Wall Street Journal report said the wire transfers indicate the beleaguered family, worth an estimated $13 billion by Forbes, may be trying to shield its wealth.
The Sackler family office, which manages the family’s investments, is called Summer Road LLC. Its address is listed as 207 Sixth St. in West Palm Beach, the Glidden Spina building, according to state records.
David Sackler, a third-generation Sackler family member, is chief executive of Summer Road, according to state records.
Sackler is a former hedge fund manager who served on the Purdue Pharma Board of Directors from 2012 to 2018. He’s also a grandson of the late Raymond Sackler, one of three brothers who created the pharmaceutical giant.
The Sixth Street building has a main floor with 8,800 square feet and a mezzanine above it with about 2,500 square feet, according to the Palm Beach County Property Appraiser’s Office.
Summer Road employees already are working in the building, even though the Glidden Spina staff hasn’t yet moved out.
A reporter who stopped by the office on Tuesday was told by a Summer Road representative that no one from the company, including Sackler, would consent to an interview.
With the explosion of the opioid epidemic, fingers have pointed not only toward Purdue Pharma but also to members of the Sackler family, one of the wealthiest in the country.
Lawsuits allege the family played an aggressive role marketing the highly addictive painkiller, flooding the nation with prescription opioids.
The family has said it is not to blame.
In a Vanity Fair article published in June, David Sackler argued that his family was being unfairly blamed for the opioid crisis, complaining that the family has had to endure “vitriolic hyperbole” and “endless castigation.”
All the attention has cast a negative light on the family, once renowned for its philanthropy toward museums, universities and nonprofits. Lately, some of these places have been the subject of protests, including at the Guggenheim museum in New York, where protesters dropped white slips of paper, meant to imitate OxyContin prescriptions. They also unveiled a banner that read, “Shame on Sackler.”
The founder of the Inside Philanthropy website even called the family’s charitable contributions “blood money.”
Attorneys general across the country also have had harsh words for the family.
“I allege that these people are among the most responsible for the trail of death and destruction the opioid epidemic has left in its wake,” North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein recently told The New York Times.
Palm Beach County has been deeply affected by the opioid crisis, which worsened when Florida turned off the OxyContin spigot and users turned to nonprescription opioids, such as heroin. The trend was detailed by The Palm Beach Post in a 2018 award-winning investigation, “How Florida Ignited the Heroin Epidemic.”
Palm Beach County has created task forces to battle heroin as well as abuses in the sober home industry.
Nevertheless, some members of the Sackler family apparently decided Palm Beach County was a suitable place for relocation, in an effort to to escape the negative attention in New York, according to an article published in the New York Post in May.
Rumors quickly began flying on Palm Beach about properties the family may have purchased, but sources say the priciest deals on the island, including the blockbuster $110 million sale of the Terry Allen Kramer estate at 1295 S. Ocean Blvd., are not Sackler purchases.
Instead, the low-rise West Palm Beach building on Sixth Street, next door to the Butcher Shop Beer Garden and Grill, is the first known property purchased by the Sacklers in Palm Beach County.
The building, the former Hopkins Marine Supply store, is just west of Flagler Drive and the Intracoastal Waterway. The property is one street away from the Flagler Memorial Bridge to Palm Beach.
The Glidden Spina building was purchased by an entity called WP Leasing LLC, whose managers are Leslie Schreyer and Jeffrey Robins, two lawyers with the New York law firm of Norton Rose Fulbright.
According to an August article in The New York Times, the lawyers received subpoenas from the New York state attorney general in connection with its effort to track down the Sackler family’s billions.
The purchase took the local real estate community by surprise because of the huge price paid for the 1950s-era building, which features a total of 11,288 square feet. Glidden Spina bought the former marine supply store building in $1.4 million in 2014, then spent $700,000 to design a creative and funky space.
Real estate sources say the Sackler family or its representative looked at various office downtown before stopping by the Glidden Spina building to take a look.
In a recent interview, Keith Spina, a Glidden Spina principal, said a representative came to his office and said, “We’d love to have your building — and everything in it.”
At the time, Spina said he did not know the identity of the family office.
But he said he had to be out of the building by Dec. 1 and therefore was rushing to complete design and construction of a new architecture office in ground floor space in the the nearby Oversea apartment complex.
Spina did say the company that bought his building is bringing 20 people.
Inside the new Sackler family office, Glidden Spina’s accents remain in place.
The interior is tricked out with modern yet warm finishes, including wood and steel accents, plus a coffee bar and lounge for employees.
There is no formal reception area that walls the offices or employees away from visitors who come through the front glass doors. Instead, the building’s interior is designed in an open style, with the half-floor mezzanine seen from downstairs.
Bankruptcy lawyers said the purchase may be problematic because several state attorney generals have sued Sackler members individually over the opioid crisis.
In April, The New York Times reported that lawsuits brought by the attorneys general of New York and Massachusetts, Letitia James and Maura Healey, named eight Sackler family members, including David Sackler.
It is not clear whether the Purdue bankruptcy will shield the Sacklers from litigation.
The settlement will provide more than $10 billion to help reimburse state and local governments and clean up the damage done by prescription painkillers and illegal opioids. The Sackler family would give up ownership of Purdue and contribute at least $3 billion toward the settlement.
Although 24 states, including Florida, have signed on to the bankruptcy to resolve claims, others have not.
Purdue Pharma’s lawyers say they will ask a judge to issue to issue an injunction to halt efforts by state attorneys general who won’t sign on.
The lawyers say they are seeking to shield the Sackler family from litigation.
But Massachusetts Attorney General Healey said she would oppose any effort to stop her claim against the family from going forward.
She wants to hold the Sackler family personally accountable.
In a Sept. 16 Wall Street Journal article, North Carolina’s Stein said the Sackler family “is trying to use bankruptcy to shield their assets.” Connecticut Attorney General William Tong echoed his remarks in the article, noting that the state will move to force the company to “disclose their hidden fortune and ensure their full wealth is now on the table."
Phil Landau, a Boca Raton bankruptcy lawyer, said courts may look askance at the $7 million Sackler family office purchase, especially given the pending complaints against individual family members.
“If you’ve been personally sued, you have a problem,” Landau said. “You’re at risk that this (purchase) could be unwound as a fraudulent transfer.”
At least one state indicated on Tuesday it is paying attention to the Sacklers’ money moves.
When asked whether the state of North Carolina would look into the purchase of the West Palm Beach building, a spokeswoman for the state attorney general said broadly, “Our office intends to pursue financial discovery from the Sacklers.”

Sarah Sanders: Media needs to take their 'opinion out of the news'

Texto completo: Former White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders blasted the media for opinionated reporting during a Wednesday appearance on Fox Business Network.
Sanders, who debuted as a Fox News contributor earlier this month, was on the show to discuss a litany of examples involving Trump and his allies' relationship with the media.
She and anchor David Asman discussed how the New York Times botched a story about Justice Brett Kavanaugh, publishing another allegation of sexual misconduct against him but failing to mention the alleged victim has no recollection of the incident.

Asman continued, "I just wonder, the milestone really seemed to be with this New York Times story on Kavanaugh where the key feature of that story, the fact that the woman doesn’t remember it happening."
"There is no victim. You can’t have a crime without a victim," Sanders exclaimed, cutting off the anchor.
"How does all this end up? The president has been talking about the New York Times, not talking about the death of the New York Times, but talking about maybe it will be reborn because of this. Do you agree?" Asman asked.
Sanders responded, "I think all of media needs to take a good hard look at how they put the news out. It’s gotten so much where there’s no process, there’s no accountability, no check and balance. It’s not just the New York Times. Politico, CNN, they all, within the last week, have had these major gaffes in their coverage."
Asman lamented that, "They still have their readers," but wondered if people could "rely on it for news stories" moving forward.
“I hope so. I think that we have to start taking so much of the opinion out of the news,” she replied. “It’s a good news story if you can read it and you have no idea which side the journalist is on and it’s very hard to find that. There’s a big difference between commentators and news, and we have blended those so that there is no difference anymore. We’ve got to go back where those are separate.”

Texto completo: President Trump's new national security adviser, Robert C. O'Brien, went to Sweden at the end of July to help secure the release of rap star A$AP Rocky.
Rocky, who's birth name is Rakim Mayers, spent weeks in a Swedish prison after a street fight took place in Stockholm on July 2. A number of celebrities supported the embattled rap star and Trump took an interest in the case. The president ultimately decided to send O'Brien, Trump's special presidential envoy for hostage affairs, to Sweden to be in the courtroom alongside Rocky.
Tweet
“The president asked me to come here and support these American citizens,” Mr. O’Brien said in an interview with the New York Times. “I’ll be here until they come home.”
When asked if he had ever been sent by the president to monitor a criminal case in a foreign country, he answered, "When foreign governments hold Americans they always claim it’s a criminal case."
A panel of four judges found Rocky guilty of assault but he was not required to serve jail time. He and his two bodyguards involved in the fight were ordered to pay the victim damages. The victim, Mustafa Jafari, asked for about $16,000 in compensation but the court awarded him only approximately $1,300 for pain and injuries.
Tweet
O'Brien later tweeted, "We appreciate the decision of Swedish prison authorities to expedite paperwork & allow the parents of A$AP Rocky, David Rispers & Bladimir Corniel to visit their sons in the detention facility. The guards were professional & treated the family & US diplomats with respect."

'No evidence it was fiction': Ex-New York Times editor defends botched Kavanaugh story

Texto completo: Former New York Times executive editor Jill Abramson defended the newspaper's story on a sexual misconduct allegation against Justice Brett Kavanaugh, even after an editor's note acknowledged it left out key details.
“I think my move would have been the moves that the Times has made. I mean, no one has challenged the basic accuracy of the story that they published, or of what is in the book," Abramson said when Fox News host Harris Faulkner asked her how she would have handled the situation. "It’s true that a material fact was left out, and the Times ran the editor’s note explaining that, which is what you do when you leave something out. But it was no conspiracy to leave out that fact. It was unfortunately cut from the piece, as I understand it.”

Faulkner then pressed Abramson for what she meant by "no one has challenged" the story, saying, "How can you challenge if the alleged victim and the one witness they talk about, who actually didn’t witness anything, he did talk to senators and the FBI about what he thinks he saw, but people may have been too drunk to remember? The alleged victim didn’t remember any assault. It’s hard to take on something that even the victim doesn’t say happened.”

"Well, it’s friends of the victim who say she doesn’t remember it. She has chosen not to talk to the press, one assumes," Abramson said, adding, “There is no evidence it was fiction."
iFrame Object
In the editor's note added almost a day later, the Times said they "did not include one element of the book's account regarding an assertion by a Yale classmate that friends of Brett Kavanaugh pushed his penis into the hand of a female student at a drunken dorm party. The book reports that the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident."
Abramson was accused earlier this year of committing plagiarism, or not properly attributing the original source material, in her book, Merchants of Truth. Abramson said she had stayed up "all night going through my book" because she took the accusations seriously. In some instances, parts of the book had been copied word-for-word from articles without attribution.

Resumen: SPRINGFIELD — Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul this week said he would reject a settlement agreement with opioid manufacturer Purdue Pharma under its reported current terms and announced a lawsuit against several other opioid manufacturers. According to the news release, Raoul’s expanded suit asks the court to "prohibit Purdue and the Sacklers’ deceptive conduct" to ensure "it does not happen again in the future," and to assess penalties against the defendants. The companies named in the suit are Johnson & Johnson; Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc.; Ortho-McNeil-Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc.; Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc.; Endo Health Solutions Inc.; Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.; Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited; Teva Pharmaceuticals USA Inc.; Cephalin Inc.; Allergan Finance LLC; Actavis Pharma Inc.; Actavis LLC; Watson Laboratories Inc.; McKesson Corporation; Cardinal Health Inc.; and AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation.

Texto completo: SPRINGFIELD — Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul this week said he would reject a settlement agreement with opioid manufacturer Purdue Pharma under its reported current terms and announced a lawsuit against several other opioid manufacturers.
In April, Raoul’s office filed a lawsuit against Purdue Pharma, the manufacturer of the opioid OxyContin and defendant in thousands of other lawsuits from local municipalities and states affected by the opioid epidemic.
Raoul’s suit alleged the company "dispatched sales representatives to Illinois hundreds of thousands of times" between 2008 and 2017, and "funded third-party publications under the guise of educational materials to promote opioids and downplay their risks."
Raoul alleged these tactics more than tripled prescriptions of Purdue’s opioids in Illinois. In a news release, he pointed to Illinois Department of Public Health statistics that showed more than 2,000 Illinoisans were killed by opioid overdoses in 2017. IDPH also reported instances of babies born with neonatal abstinence syndrome, which can be caused by opioid exposure, increased by 64 percent from 2011 to 2017.
In August, Raoul expanded the suit against Purdue to include members of the Sackler family, which founded and operates Purdue Pharma.
"The Sackler family knowingly misled the public and continued pushing Purdue’s addictive opioids without care or consideration of the death and destruction their product caused," Raoul said in a statement Wednesday.
Raoul’s statement was in response to media reports that detailed a tentative settlement between Purdue and thousands of municipal governments and more than 20 states.
The New York Times reported the deal, for which final details are still being negotiated, would compel Purdue to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and dissolve. A new company would be formed that could continue selling OxyContin and other medicines, but its profits would be used to pay the plaintiffs in the suit, which was reported to be worth $12 billion.
Purdue would also be required to donate drugs for addiction and overdose treatment, and the Sackler family would donate $3 billion in cash over seven years but would not be forced to admit any wrongdoing.
Raoul, however, was among at least 20 attorneys general who told NBC News they had not agreed to the deal.
"My office is prepared to hold the Sacklers accountable, regardless of whether or not Purdue declares bankruptcy, and I am pleased that a majority of states will continue to fight," he said in a statement.
According to the news release, Raoul’s expanded suit asks the court to "prohibit Purdue and the Sacklers’ deceptive conduct" to ensure "it does not happen again in the future," and to assess penalties against the defendants. Raoul is also asking the court to require the defendants to pay to help remediate the opioid problem and forfeit profits resulting from the alleged misconduct.
"I reject in the strongest terms, any agreement that does not adequately hold the Sackler family accountable for the irreparable harm their actions caused to families in Illinois and across the country," Raoul said in the statement. "My office expanded our lawsuit against Purdue Pharma to include the Sacklers because as the family behind Purdue, their ruthless pursuit of profits destroyed other families and communities throughout Illinois and the nation."
Raoul filed a similar lawsuit Tuesday against 16 other opioid manufacturers, alleging they "carried out unfair and deceptive marketing campaigns that prioritized profits over public health."
The companies’ actions, Raoul’s office said in a news release, "resulted in unprecedented levels of opioid prescribing, while the distributors irresponsibly flooded Illinois with opioids, failing in their role as gatekeepers in preventing the diversion of opioids."
Raoul’s lawsuit seeks similar results as the one against Purdue: to "abate and remedy the statewide public nuisance," prohibit the manufacturers’ and distributors’ "deceptive and unfair conduct" and force penalties on the companies.
The companies named in the suit are Johnson & Johnson; Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc.; Ortho-McNeil-Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc.; Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc.; Endo Health Solutions Inc.; Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.; Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited; Teva Pharmaceuticals USA Inc.; Cephalin Inc.; Allergan Finance LLC; Actavis Pharma Inc.; Actavis LLC; Watson Laboratories Inc.; McKesson Corporation; Cardinal Health Inc.; and AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation.

Group spends big to support Collins

Texto completo: The campaign by 1820 PAC is the latest effort by outside or independent groups – many funded by secretive "dark money" – to flood Maine's airwaves and digital screens with ads in the 2020 U.S. Senate race.
AUGUSTA — Another outside political group is spending six figures on television ads in Maine, this time supporting incumbent Republican Sen. Susan Collins as she faces what could be her toughest reelection battle.
A financial disclosure report filed Monday with the Federal Election Commission shows that a group called 1820 PAC spent $276,780 on “media placement” in support of Collins. That is roughly one-third of the money that 1820 PAC — presumably named for the year Maine attained statehood — has collected from a handful of wealthy donors around the country, with $500,000 alone coming from New York billionaire Stephen Schwarzman.
1820 PAC is just the latest in a likely blizzard of outside or independent groups — many funded with “dark money” from unnamed donors — as well as out-of-state donors, who will try to sway Maine voters headed into the 2020 elections. Federal law prohibits independent groups from coordinating with candidates. But 1820 PAC’s entire website is devoted to supporting Collins — who has yet to officially announce her reelection bid — and a 30-second ad posted on YouTube talks about her bipartisan ratings and work on issues important to the elderly, veterans and Maine’s defense industry.
“Susan Collins: Effective. Independent. In the Maine tradition,” says the ad, which uses stock footage of Collins made available by her office several months ago.
The six-figure, pro-Collins media blitz comes at a time when opponents of Collins are seizing on a new sexual misconduct allegation against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh to remind Maine voters about her pivotal vote to support his nomination. The vote prompted several progressive groups to raise more than $4 million for an as-yet-undetermined Democratic opponent in 2020. But Collins also experienced a massive surge in donations to her would-be campaign after the Kavanaugh vote.
Collins’ opponents are trying to chip away at her reputation as a moderate Republican by tying her to President Trump — who is unpopular with independents and moderates who have supported her in the past — and to Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
“At the time of his confirmation, there was plenty of evidence that put into question Brett Kavanaugh’s fitness for the Supreme Court,” Maine House Speaker Sara Gideon, a Democrat who is running for Collins’ seat, said in a tweet on Tuesday. “Senator Collins cast a critical vote to confirm him anyway, and she said she doesn’t regret it. It’s time for a senator who puts Mainers first.”
Collins’ supporters and Republicans have been highly critical of Gideon’s out-of-state fundraising — even as Collins courts non-Maine donors as well — and of several other organizations that have not disclosed their donors. One of those “dark money” organizations, the 16 Counties Coalition, was set up as a nonprofit to pressure Collins on issues important to moderates and is staffed by several longtime Democratic operatives, including a recent spokesman for Gideon.
A spokesman for the Maine Democratic Party, in turn, seized on 1820 PAC’s spending as a suggestion that Collins’ supporters are worried.
“We’re 14 months out from election day and the 22-year senior senator’s numbers have cratered so much that six-figure positive ads are coming out to prop her up,” party spokesman Alex Stack said.
Spending on Maine’s Senate race is widely expected to set new records for the state. Five people have filed paperwork with the FEC to seek the Democratic nomination: Gideon of Freeport, progressive advocate and lobbyist Betsy Sweet of Hallowell, attorney Bre Kidman of Saco, retired Air Force major general Jonathan “Tracer” Treacy of Oxford and Michael Bunker of Bangor.
1820 PAC formed in March and lists a Washington, D.C., post office box as its address, which is common for political action committees and super PACs. The treasurer of the organization, Thomas Datwyler, did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. A spokesman for Collins’ campaign could not be reached for comment.
Financial reports filed by the PAC show that seven individuals or entities donated $776,000 to 1820 PAC.
The largest donor, by far, was Schwarzman, a close Trump ally who serves as CEO and co-founder of the private equity firm Blackstone Group. The campaign finance watchdog group, the Center for Public Integrity, said the $12.9 million donated by Schwarzman and his wife, Christine, during the 2018 election cycle ranked him ninth overall among individual political donors. All of that money flowed to Republican or conservative candidates and organizations.
Schwarzman’s Blackstone Group also owns one of the health care organizations that has bankrolled a national ad campaign seeking to pressure members of Congress, including Collins, on legislation dealing with unexpected medical bills. The political action group Doctor Patient Unity reportedly reserved more than six-figures worth of airtime in Maine — part of a national ad campaign that The New York Times recently pegged at $28 million — for ads that tell listeners to “ask Senator Collins to protect patients.”
Blackstone Group owns TeamHealth, an organization that owns physician practices and helps staff emergency rooms. The company and another private equity-backed physicians’ practice group is fighting to defeat legislation that aims to end so-called “surprise billing,” which is when patients receive unexpected invoices from doctors or ER facilities that do not participate in their insurance coverage, The New York Times reported.

Texto completo: He inherited one of the most famous names in Mexico.
Javier Burillo Azcarraga's grandfather founded the company that would become Grupo Televisa, the world's largest Spanish-language entertainment company. Burillo would go on to marry a former Mexican president's daughter in 1989 and over the years make a name for himself developing luxury resorts in Mexico.
But on Sunday, the 57-year-old was arrested on suspicion of vehicular manslaughter with a vessel, willful harm or injury to a child, and operating a boat while under the influence after his 11-year-old son died on a boating trip in San Francisco Bay. Records show Burillo was released Monday afternoon on $1-million bond.

The Marin County district attorney's office said Tuesday that the case was still being reviewed.
Although police identified him as Javier A. Burillo, property records reviewed by the Associated Press show Burillo's full name is Javier Burillo Azcarraga, a wealthy developer with ties to one of the most powerful families in Mexico.
The Azcarraga family founded the Mexican network Grupo Televisa, an international media leader that produces Spanish- language programming throughout Latin America. Over several decades, the media conglomerate has dominated in television, publishing and radio broadcasting.
According to Univision, Burillo owns several restaurants, hotels and high-end resorts in Mexico, including in Cabo San Lucas and San Jose del Cabo. Property records also show that Burillo's Marin County home was purchased in 2004 for $10.2 million and that he and his wife, Rose, own properties in San Diego and Sausalito, according to the Associated Press.
Although any professional involvement between Burillo and Televisa is unclear, the Marin Independent Journal reports that divorce court filings show Burillo has nontaxable income of $176,000 per month from family sources.
"Javier is a member of an extraordinarily and politically powerful family in Mexico," Rose wrote in a court filing seeking child support.
Burillo is listed on public genealogy websites as the grandson of Emilio Azcarraga Vidaurreta, as reported by a Univision station.
Televisa's founding can be traced back to 1930, when Azcarraga Vidaurreta bought a Mexico City radio station as the family's first venture in communications.
His son, Emilio Azcarraga Milmo, would go on to head the board and name the company Televisa after his father's death in 1972, the New York Times reported. His work would make him a billionaire and establish his family business as a media dynasty.
Emilio Azcarraga Jean, Azcarraga Milmo's son -- who served as the company's chief executive for nearly two decades after his father's death in 1997 -- ranks on Forbes' 2019 list of billionaires with a net worth of $1.3 billion.
Based on this family tree, Burillo is believed to be the cousin of Azcarraga Jean, who stills serves as president.
Televisa, once known as Telesistema Mexicano, is credited in the book "Mexico: An Encyclopedia of Contemporary Culture and History," by Don M. Coerver, Suzanne B. Pasztor and Robert Buffington, with revolutionizing Mexican television by bringing telenovelas to mainstream audiences, a force in the company's monopolization of television broadcasting.
The company has long worked with Univision as a broadcaster of its shows, particularly its telenovelas, in the United States. Univision pays Televisa, which also owns a stake in Univision, nearly $400 million a year in royalties for the programming, although that may change as Univision looks beyond Televisa's telenovela offerings.

Alex Trebek Explains Further Chemotherapy

Texto completo: Alex Trebek, the longtime host of "Jeopardy!" who announced in March he had Stage 4 pancreatic cancer, revealed on Tuesday that he was undergoing a new round of chemotherapy to treat the disease.
Mr. Trebek disclosed the additional treatment in an interview with T.J. Holmes on "Good Morning America."
In the interview, Mr. Trebek, 79, explained that he had recently lost 12 pounds in a week and that his health had suffered after his first bout of chemotherapy ended in August. He said he was at times overwhelmed with fatigue and surges of depression.
"I realize that there is an end in sight for me, just as there is for everyone else," Mr. Trebek said. "One line that I have used with our staff in recent weeks and months is, that when I do pass on, one thing they will not say at my funeral is, 'Oh, he was taken from us too soon."'
When he announced his diagnosis, Mr. Trebek told "Jeopardy!" fans in a YouTube video: "Normally the prognosis for this is not very encouraging. But I'm going to fight this, and I'm going to keep working."
In the interview on Tuesday, he reiterated his promise to keep working, saying he had no plans to stop hosting the show.
"As long as I can walk out and greet the audience and the contestants and run the game, I'm happy," he said.
Pancreatic cancer is one of the hardest cancers to treat. Even in a patient with good prospects -- which includes the 10 percent to 15 percent whose cancer is diagnosed early and can be surgically removed -- there is a high risk of recurrence, according to a New York Times article published in March.
Up to 85 percent of patients who have surgery followed by chemotherapy have a recurrence at some point, usually within two years, the article said. Still, even those who survive five or more years are at risk of another setback.
Mr. Trebek is a native of Ontario who worked for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation before joining the NBC game show "Wizard of Odds" in 1973. He became the host of "Jeopardy!" in 1984.
In 2018, Mr. Trebek suggested he was considering leaving the show in 2020, but he ended up renewing his contract. He is scheduled to host "Jeopardy!" until 2022.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Stedman Graham reveals secret to success

Texto completo: Brother, athlete, African-American businessman and Oprah Winfrey's longtime partner are just some of the labels people have used to describe Stedman Graham over the years. His latest book, Identity Leadership: To Lead Others You Must First Lead Yourself aims to help people let go of their own labels.
"Through my own personal life of being defined by my relationship, being defined by my race, being defined by my labels, being defined by family, being defined by all of that, what I was looking for through and created through this process was how to define myself," Graham said.
The New Jersey native says he wrote the book to get more people to see the importance of self-actualization.
"Unless you know who you are, unless you have an identity, unless you have strong leadership skills, unless you have the ability and motivation to do things on your own, you're pretty much out of it. Those things that most of us do every day are not relevant to self-actualizing and that's why I wrote this book," the 68-year-old said.
Graham says the importance of self-actualization has benefits that reach far beyond self-awareness and can help make you a better person in general.
"Identity leadership is self-leadership. It's based on the philosophy that you can not lead anyone else until you can at first lead yourself. I teach a self-actualization process and the reason that is important because the 21st century requires us to have skills, talents, abilities, and teaches, wants us to have an identity," said the New York Times bestselling author.
By constantly learning about who we are, Graham says we are tackling some of the biggest hurdles faced by entrepreneurs today, adapting to stay relevant.
"The big word today is 'relevant.' Are you relevant to the world that you live in every single day? Being relevant requires a learning process which means you have to keep up based on learning. Learning is the most important thing you can do today," the businessman turned motivational speaker said.
Graham will be at the Museum of the American Revolution to discuss his most recent book Wednesday, Sept. 18, 2019 from 6 p.m. to 7 p.m. He will be signing the book after the talk. Tickets are free, but registration is required. For more information, visit www.amrevmuseum.org.

Texto completo: Morning Joe host Joe Scarborough slammed California Sen. Kamala Harris for defending a new unsubstantiated allegation of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
"I heard Kamala Harris say, 'We have to believe the victims,'" Scarborough said Tuesday morning on his show. "As a prosecutor, she really should put in the word 'alleged' in front of the word 'victims,' especially in the case of the New York Times essay."
"If you believed the alleged victim in the alleged incident, the alleged victim in the alleged incident doesn’t ever remember the alleged incident occurring. So if Kamala Harris is believing the, quote, victim, the alleged victim, the alleged victim says, 'I don’t ever remember that happening,' according to friends. So I'm just — again, for a lawyer, I'm confused."

This weekend, the New York Times ran a story which cited several unnamed officials saying that a witness had new allegations of sexual misconduct regarding Kavanaugh.
Max Stier, the witness according to several unnamed officials, reportedly saw Kavanaugh's friends push "his penis into the hand of a female student." Stier, 52, refused to talk with the Times about the incident, and the alleged "victim" has denied the incident ever happened.
The New York Times issued a lengthy editor's note after it was pointed out that the story did not include the victim's denial that the event happened.
Stier was a lawyer for Bill Clinton during his presidency when Kavanaugh was part of a legal team investigating Clinton.

Warren attacks Trump's sister over ‘potential fraud’ before resigning as judge

Texto completo: Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren ripped into President Trump's sister, Maryanne Trump Barry, in a scathing op-ed titled "My Plan to End Corruption," published on Monday.
Citing Barry's recent resignation as senior judge for the United States Court of Appeals, the Massachusetts Democrat charged that Trump's elder sister, who is 82, resigned to prevent an investigation into fraud allegations. Barry left her post earlier this year after serving on the 3rd Circuit's highest court for 19 years as an appointee of President Bill Clinton.
Barry had previously served as a judge for the District Court of New Jersey beginning in 1983. Warren, who asserted that Barry's departure was intended to end a federal investigation into the "Trump family’s decades-long tax schemes, including potential fraud," linked to a New York Times story about Trump family finances from last year. The story asserts that Barry actively participated in manipulating her family's fortune to avoid heavy taxes.
An investigation into the judicial conduct stemming from the alleged tax schemes began earlier this year. Having not heard cases in over two years, Barry filed her official retirement papers in April. As a retired judge, she is not subject to investigations into conduct.
"Under my plan," Warren vows, "investigations will remain open until their findings are made public and any penalties for misconduct are issued."
Warren's campaign promise was part of a larger intention to "Close the loophole that allows federal judges to escape investigations for misconduct by stepping down from their post." Warren also names former Appellate Judge Alex Kozinski and the contentious confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh as evidentiary of judicial corruption.
"When Ninth Circuit Judge Alex Kozinski was confronted with a judicial ethics investigation for sexual misconduct towards young female law clerks, he resigned — and the investigation immediately ended," Warren said. "Similarly, sexual assault and perjury complaints against Brett Kavanaugh were dismissed when he was confirmed to the Supreme Court, and Donald Trump’s sister Maryanne Trump-Barry resigned from the bench, ending an investigation into the Trump family’s decades-long tax schemes, including potential fraud."
Warren also condemned conservative lawmakers for championing small government, seemingly holding them responsible for the failings of federal programs. "It’s true that right-wing politicians have spent a generation attacking the very idea of government," she said. "But it’s also true that these days, our government doesn’t work for most people. Sure, it works great for the wealthy and the well-connected — but for everybody else, it doesn’t."
Her plan also espouses "Medicare for all," the ending of private health insurance, and universal childcare as necessary to end corruption in the U.S. government. But it is the president that she holds the most responsible for what she describes as a lack of trust in government.
"Make no mistake about it: The Trump Administration is the most corrupt administration of our lifetimes," Warren stated. She ends her plan to end corruption in the White House with a promise that "big structural changes ... will once again restore our trust in government by showing that it can work for all of us. And when I’m President, that’s exactly what I’ll do."

Darien’s Scott Hapgood fulfills bail conditions in manslaughter case

Texto completo: A Darien man accused of manslaughter in Anguilla has fulfilled his bail conditions in that country and now awaits a decision on whether he will face trial, according to his spokesman.
Scott Hapgood, accused of killing a hotel worker in an April incident he said was in self-defense, attended a preliminary inquiry hearing last week on the Caribbean island.
Jamie Diaferia, a spokesman for Hapgood and CEO of the New York public relations firm Infinite Global, declined to comment because the hearing was closed.
The hearing has been adjourned to Nov. 11 until further witnesses can be heard.
Hapgood, 44, has been charged with manslaughter in the death of 27-year-old Kenny Mitchel. Hapgood, a Darien resident who is on leave from his job as a UBS trader, has been accused of killing the hotel worker in April during a violent struggle while on vacation with his family in the Caribbean.
Hapgood’s attorney, Juliya Arbisman, of Amsterdam & Partners LLP, said Anguilla police have warned of potential threats of violence as her client has returned to the island several times in the past month for court appearances.
Hapgood, who spoke publicly for the first time at a press conference in New York City last month, released a statement after making a brief court appearance in late August in Anguilla.
“I am grateful for the opportunity to appear in Anguillan courts today because every court appearance means we are one step closer to putting this nightmare behind us — a nightmare for my family but also for the people of Anguilla,” Hapgood said in the statement.
“We came to your beautiful island for a vacation, just like many thousands of others do each year. We came here because of how welcoming you all are. Unfortunately, my family and I were in the wrong place at the wrong time, and in an instant, a tragedy resulted that has changed our lives and yours forever.”
Marshal Mitchel, the half-brother of Kenny Mitchel, spoke to a group of reporters the same day outside the Anguilla courthouse, saying the family wants justice.
“As long as he (gets) jail, justice is served,” Marshall Mitchel said, according to the New York Post. “He (Hapgood) had enough time to let go of my brother. He needs to understand he (took) a life.”
The Hapgood family has said the Darien man was defending himself and his young children — aged 14, 12 and 9 — after Mitchel came to their room to fix a bathroom sink. Hapgood contended the sink was never broken and no one called for someone to come to their room, but he trusted Mitchel because he was wearing a hotel uniform.
The family has accused Mitchel of pulling a knife, resulting in Hapgood “fighting for his life” and being bitten multiple times, including on the face.
A toxicology report released last month revealed Mitchel tested positive for cocaine, Delta-9 THC (the active substance in marijuana) and other drugs. The report also showed that Mitchel had a blood-alcohol content level of .181, which is more than double the legal limit in the United States and the United Kingdom, which is .08.
“The toxicology report confirms that Scott Hapgood had no choice but to defend himself and his children from the frenzied attack of a man under the influence of a dangerous combination of illegal drugs and alcohol,” Arbisman said after the report was released.
Mitchel was also facing rape charges stemming from a March 25 incident with his former girlfriend and mother of their child, according to a New York Times report. The case was pending when he died.
However, the woman told the Times Mitchel did not rape her, and that the incident leading to his arrest was “a misunderstanding.” She reiterated that in a recent story about Hapgood in Town & Country magazine.
Residents on the island were outraged Hapgood was permitted to return to Connecticut after Mitchel’s death. Hapgood was originally held at Her Majesty’s Prison in Anguilla when he was denied bail. But he was later released on bond after his attorney appealed to the High Court.
“I understand your anger,” Hapgood said to Anguilla residents in his statement released in August.
“I’ve read the same false facts and untrue stories about what allegedly happened in that room on that fateful day in April. If I lived here and believed those stories, I’d be angry, too. But the stories you’ve read and heard are not what happened, and someday I will be able to tell the real story in a legal setting. The sooner that day comes, the better.”

Texto completo: Sen. Mitch McConnell tweeted out support for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh on Sunday after a new report by the New York Times found more people who corroborated an alleged incident from college that came up during his confirmation hearings.
"The far left's willingness to seize on completely uncorroborated and unsubstantiated allegations during last year's confirmation process was a dark and embarrassing chapter for the Senate," McConnell tweeted. "Fortunately a majority of Senators and the American people rallied behind timeless principles such as due process and the presumption of innocence. I look forward to many years of service to come from Justice Kavanaugh."
McConnell tweeted Monday, "Despite a lack of any corroborating evidence, leading Democrats tried to grab onto yet another unsubstantiated allegation against Justice Brett Kavanaugh. We all remember this pattern from last time around: Shoot first and correct the facts later."
In a second Monday tweet, the senator wrote that, "My Republican colleagues and I will fight to preserve a fair and independent judiciary."
Following the publication of the New York Times report on Saturday, multiple Democratic senators and candidates for president have suggested that Kavanaugh should be impeached from the court, arguing that he lied under oath when he discussed the alleged incident.
The New York Times report found at least seven people who had heard of an incident at Yale long before the confirmation process, in which Kavanaugh was alleged to have thrust his genitals in the face of classmate Deborah Ramirez without her consent at a party.
The report also added that the FBI interviewed none of the 25 individuals that Ramirez's legal team told the agency may have corroborating evidence of her allegations.
The Times also uncovered a new account by another Yale classmate, Max Stier, who alleged that he saw Kavanaugh with his pants down at a different party and his friends pushing his penis into the hands of a female student. Stier did not go public with the allegation during the confirmation but reported it to the FBI and senators.
The Times updated the story on Sunday to clarify that the female student involved in this alleged incident declined to be interviewed and her friends say that she does not recall the incident.
Kavanaugh denied the allegation of Ramirez during the confirmation hearings, saying that such an incident would have been "the talk of campus" if true.
President Donald Trump also tweeted support for Kavanaugh and criticism of the report throughout Sunday and into Monday morning.
After Kavanaugh's confirmation, McConnell called it "the single most important thing I've been involved in in my career."
"I have zero tolerance for the kind of behavior Justice Kavanaugh was accused of, but I think it's important to remind everybody that there was no corroborating evidence," McConnell said last October.

White House Will Let Former Campaign Chairman Speak to Congress

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The White House on Monday blocked two more former aides to President Trump from testifying in House Democrats' impeachment inquiry, but cleared a third witness, Corey Lewandowski, to appear publicly on Tuesday and answer limited questions about potential obstruction of justice by the president.
The White House decisions amounted to mixed news for the House Judiciary Committee as it tries to crank up the intensity of an investigation devised to determine whether to recommend Mr. Trump's impeachment for obstruction of justice and abuse of power -- and to convince the public that such action is warranted.
In Mr. Lewandowski, who managed Mr. Trump's presidential campaign and remained a confidant once he became president, the judiciary panel will be getting a figure who could help bring to life evidence uncovered by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel who investigated Russia's interference in the 2016 election. Though the panel has publicly quizzed legal experts and Mr. Mueller on his findings, Mr. Lewandowski will be the first fact witness referenced in Mr. Mueller's report whom the White House has not blocked from publicly testifying entirely.
He played an important role in an attempt by the president in summer 2017 to effectively end scrutiny of Mr. Trump's campaign, one of several episodes that Democrats have said were clear cases of obstruction. But Mr. Lewandowski is also pugnacious, fiercely loyal to Mr. Trump and contemplating a Senate run in New Hampshire -- and he has pledged to "fight back" against the Democrats.
"I am an open book," he said in August in a Fox News Radio interview. "I want to go and remind the American people that these guys are on a witch hunt."
The White House ordered two other former aides to Mr. Trump, Rob Porter and Rick A. Dearborn, not to appear before the Judiciary Committee, a move that will only compound a fight playing out in the courts over whether Mr. Trump can continue to effectively stonewall attempts by Congress to investigate his administration, including by refusing to allow current and former officials to testify.
The White House counsel, Pat A. Cipollone, wrote to the committee late Monday, saying that Mr. Lewandowski would be free to discuss his work on the Trump campaign and matters that have already been made public by Mr. Mueller, but not any other additional communications he may have had with Mr. Trump after the election. As senior White House aides, Mr. Porter and Mr. Dearborn were "absolutely immune" from congressional testimony, he said in another letter.
"In light of the long-settled principles discussed above, and in order to protect the prerogatives of the office of president, the White House has directed Mr. Lewandowski not to discuss the substance of any conversations he had with the president or senior presidential advisers about official government matters, unless the information is expressly contained in the report," Mr. Cipollone wrote.
Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York and the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, promptly rejected the claims as "a shocking and dangerous assertion of executive privilege and absolute immunity."
"If he were to prevail in this cover-up while the Judiciary Committee is considering whether to recommend articles of impeachment," Mr. Nadler said of the president, "he would upend the separation of powers as envisioned by our founders."
Democrats do not recognize any legitimate constraints of Mr. Lewandowski's testimony because he never worked in the White House, potentially foreshadowing a fight on Tuesday over what he can and cannot say.
And the House has already initiated a lawsuit in federal court challenging the long-held executive branch position that senior presidential aides have "absolute immunity" from congressional subpoenas. Though that suit is nominally intended to free up the testimony of Donald F. McGahn II, the former White House counsel and perhaps the most important obstruction-related witness, a ruling in the committee's favor could force the White House to let other aides, like Mr. Porter and Mr. Dearborn, testify as well.
Tuesday's hearing is shaping up to be an important test for Democrats as they struggle to engage and retain the public's attention with what they argue is ample evidence of impeachable conduct. Democrats' increasingly muddled messaging on impeachment has not helped, as party leaders and liberal lawmakers have publicly disagreed over whether a meaningful impeachment inquiry is underway.
Mr. Nadler sought earlier Monday to clear up lingering questions about the seriousness of his panel's work.
"Personally, I think the president ought to be impeached," Mr. Nadler said during an interview on WNYC. But, he conceded, the House was still divided on that point and would not advance impeachment articles unless it could win over public support.
"The American people have to be educated and they have to be convinced," he said. "We cannot impeach the president against the will of the American people."
To that end, Democrats are likely to use most of their questioning on Tuesday to spotlight a scheme in which the president enlisted Mr. Lewandowski to try to curtail the special counsel investigation, one of 10 possible acts of obstruction detailed by Mr. Mueller. They may also ask Mr. Lewandowski about his knowledge of the Trump campaign's contacts with Russians.
The attempts to influence Mr. Mueller's work occurred in June and July 2017, not long after Mr. Trump ordered Mr. McGahn to fire Mr. Mueller, a command he refused.
In this case, the report says the president "dictated a message" to Mr. Lewandowski that he wanted him to deliver to Jeff Sessions, the attorney general. The message instructed Mr. Sessions, who was recused from the matter, to state publicly that the special counsel's investigation was "very unfair," and then to significantly narrow its scope to prevent future interference, effectively ending the investigators' scrutiny of Mr. Trump's campaign.
Mr. Trump followed up about a month later, and Mr. Lewandowski indicated he would deliver the message. He did not, however, and instead asked Mr. Dearborn, a former aide to Mr. Sessions then working in the White House, to do so instead. Mr. Dearborn, too, was uneasy about the request, and Mr. Mueller wrote that he never delivered it.
Because of a Justice Department policy that prohibits charging a sitting president, Mr. Mueller ultimately did not decide one way or another whether Mr. Trump's actions amounted to criminal obstruction of justice.
While Mr. Porter was not directly involved in the president's efforts to limit the scope of Mr. Mueller's work, his job put him in proximity to Mr. Trump and made him aware of the flow of information coming in and out of the Oval Office. As staff secretary, Mr. Porter's notes from the White House are frequently referenced in Mr. Mueller's report, and he was wrapped up in the president's attempts to get Mr. McGahn to falsely deny that he had ordered him to fire Mr. Mueller after The New York Times revealed the episode.
Mr. Trump, for his part, continues to rail against congressional investigators, whose work he has portrayed as a desperate attempt to take him down. On Monday, he wrote on Twitter that Democrats had "given up" on the findings of the Mueller report, were hunting through "everything else" about him to try to make their case and should instead look at lucrative book and television deals signed by his predecessor Barack Obama and other Democrats.
As Tuesday's hearing was expected to demonstrate, Democrats continue to see Mr. Mueller's findings as a central part of their impeachment investigation. But they have begun broadening their scope this fall in an effort to evaluate the severity of other potential offenses.
The committee has set an additional deadline for Tuesday one of those other areas of scrutiny: reports that Mr. Trump has dangled pardons to immigration officials willing to carry out his policies at the border even if they break the law. Homeland security officials are under subpoena to hand over documents relevant to several reported episodes, which Mr. Trump has denied.

A crucial piece of news, lost in delivery

Texto completo: If you happened to see the article based on a new book about Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh in print, you might have flipped right past it. It was on an inside page of the New York Times Sunday Review section with a soft, feature-story headline: "Brett Kavanaugh Fit In. She Did Not." Oddly, it was labeled "news analysis" and wasn't even promoted on the front page of the section. If you happened to see the article first because of a Times tweet (and if you were the least bit enlightened), you would have been appalled. It began: "Having a penis thrust in your face at a drunken dorm party may seem like harmless fun." If you read the article, though, some startling news - or what seemed like news - jumped out.
The book authors, Times reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, wrote that they had found significant corroboration that Deborah Ramirez - a Yale classmate of Kavanaugh's - had experienced an incident in which the future Supreme Court justice thrust his penis at her at a college party.
And they wrote that they had uncovered an account of a different incident involving Kavanaugh. Another classmate - now the prominent lawyer Max Stier - said he saw Kavanaugh with his pants down at a different party, where friends of his "pushed his penis into the hands of a female student."
What wasn't in the essay was a crucial piece of information: that the woman supposedly involved in the Stier-relayed incident wouldn't corroborate the story, or be interviewed, and that her friends said she didn't remember it.
The Times has been busy over the past two days fixing the story online, explaining some aspects of what happened, and apologizing for the tweet.
And politicians at the highest levels are expressing outrage: President Trump accused the Times of smearing Kavanaugh with lies: "The one who is actually being assaulted is Justice Kavanaugh - Assaulted by lies and Fake News!"
And several Democratic presidential candidates called for Kavanaugh's impeachment.
And, sadly, what's been downplayed - or at least less shouted from the rooftops - is the actual news that was in the essay: that Stier notified senators and the FBI about what he witnessed, but the FBI chose not to investigate before Kavanaugh's ascendancy to his lifetime appointment on the highest court in the land.
Other news organizations have followed up on that and confirmed it. But that's not what's getting the most attention.
Why the Times's essay was so poorly handled, on so many fronts, is murky.
I asked the highest-ranking editors on the news and opinion sides of the paper - Dean Baquet and James Bennet - for interviews on Monday morning but got no answer. (Unsurprisingly, I tended to get much better response when I was public editor of the Times from 2012 to 2016.)
But I can piece this much together from the Times's official communications on the subject and from background conversations with other journalists, including at the Times:
First, it's not unusual for book excerpts and essays to appear in the Sunday Review section, which is part of the opinion department, not the news section.
In fact, that's a fairly common landing place for excerpts, although there's certainly no rule about it. For example, the excerpt of Times reporter Mike Isaac's book about Uber, "Super Pumped," appeared in the business section.
What clearly should have happened here is that the reporters themselves - or one of the editors handling the essay - should have alerted the news desk that there was fresh information that should be evaluated for a possible story in the news pages.
Even a second or third editor proofreading the article should have picked up on this and raised a red flag.
If that had happened, some important questions would have been asked and the blunders probably averted.
The actual news then could have been put in a news-side headline and article, where it belonged.
The tweet - which may have set a new insensitivity record for social media from a major news organization - is something of a sideshow here.
Still, let's acknowledge just how awful it is to consider, even for a brain-dead moment, sexual assault as harmless fun. Anybody can make a bad misjudgment, but there should be a review process in place - yes, editing! - that halts one this bad in its tracks.
But the real harm was not in the tweet but in the need for the editor's note appended to the story Sunday night.
"The book," it read, "reports that the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident. That information has been added to the article."
In these contentious days of bad-faith politics and maneuvering for advantage, the presentation and framing of stories - as well as their dead-on accuracy - are more important than ever.
There's little room for error and not a shred of forgiveness for it.
By all accounts, Pogrebin's and Kelly's book is a well-reported and thoughtful exploration of the Kavanaugh saga.
Jill Filipovic, in her review for The Washington Post, called it "a remarkable work of slowed-down journalism."
Because of the bungled handling of the essay, that's not how it's going to be remembered.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — As Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh prepares for his second year on the Supreme Court, new reporting has detailed how the limits ordered by the White House and Senate Republicans last year constrained the FBI investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct when he was a college freshman.
The FBI was informed of allegations that Kavanaugh, while drunk during his freshman year at Yale, exposed himself to two heavily intoxicated female classmates on separate occasions. The bureau did not interview more than a dozen people who said they could provide information about the incidents.
One of the accounts, reported by Deborah Ramirez, was made public at the time of Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings.
The other, not publicly known until this weekend, was reported by a male classmate who said he witnessed the incident. He unsuccessfully sought to get the FBI to investigate with help from a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee who asked FBI Director Christopher A. Wray to look into the allegation.
The new details are based on interviews conducted by this reporter and two reporters for The New York Times for books about the confirmation. The New York Times reported some details late Saturday from its reporters’ new book.
Wray has declined requests by this reporter to be interviewed about the bureau’s performance. Kavanaugh also declined to be interviewed.
The best-known allegation against Kavanaugh was the accusation by Christine Blasey Ford, a psychology professor from California, that he assaulted her when they were high school students. Kavanaugh heatedly denied her allegation when he and Ford testified before the Judiciary Committee in a televised hearing.
The committee’s Republican majority declined to give a public hearing to Ramirez, and it is unclear how many senators knew of the allegation of a second, similar incident at Yale. The committee’s chairman, Sen. Charles E. Grassley, R-Iowa, and its senior Democrat, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, were both informed of the existence of the allegation.
Ramirez alleged that Kavanaugh exposed his penis and caused her to touch it while they were inebriated during a drinking game in a dormitory suite in late 1983 or early 1984. Kavanaugh denied her allegation.
The other allegation, previously unreported, came from Washington lawyer Max Stier, who told Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., that he witnessed Kavanaugh exposing himself to a different female classmate during their freshman year.
Both Kavanaugh and the woman were heavily intoxicated at the time, according to Stier’s account, as described by people familiar with the contacts between him and Coons and others who have spoken with Stier since Kavanaugh’s confirmation.
The woman in that case, a friend of Ramirez, has denied that she was assaulted, telling friends she has no memory of such an incident. According to Stier’s account, the woman was so inebriated at the time that she could easily have no memory of it.
Coons sent Wray a letter on Oct. 2 — four days before the Senate voted on Kavanaugh — specifically naming Stier as someone he wanted the FBI director to follow up with.
The FBI never contacted Stier. The bureau also did not interview other classmates who said they had heard at the time of either the incident Stier reported or the one involving Ramirez.
Stier has declined to comment publicly on the allegation. He wanted his account to remain confidential, both for the sake of the woman, a widow with three children, and for his own professional considerations.
Stier founded a nonpartisan, nonprofit group to promote public service roughly two decades ago. Before that, he was a lawyer at Washington’s Williams & Connolly firm, where he worked with the team that defended then-President Bill Clinton. Several Republican commentators on Sunday zeroed in on that part of his resume to discredit his account as partisan.
During the hearings, Kavanaugh stated under oath that he was never so drunk that he would pass out or forget what he’d done while intoxicated.
A number of former classmates who knew him said they were sufficiently upset by that statement, which they considered untruthful, that they contacted the FBI. None received responses from the bureau.
On Sunday, President Donald Trump defended Kavanaugh.
Trump called on the Justice Department to “come to (Kavanaugh’s) rescue,” suggesting on Twitter that the administration’s opponents were trying to deter the justice from rulings favorable to the administration.
“They are trying to influence his opinions. Can’t let that happen!” he wrote.
“He is an innocent man who has been treated HORRIBLY,” Trump wrote in one tweet. In another, he urged that the justice sue for “liable,” later correcting the spelling to “libel.”
The new reports reopened some of the bitter, partisan divisions that accompanied Kavanaugh’s confirmation. Several Democratic presidential hopefuls called for Kavanaugh’s impeachment, including Sen. Kamala Harris, a Judiciary committee member, who wrote on Twitter that “Brett Kavanaugh lied to the U.S. Senate and most importantly to the American people.”
Sen. Elizabeth Warren, former Housing Secretary Julian Castro and former Rep. Beto O’Rourke made similar calls.
Warren tweeted that the new allegations were “disturbing,” adding, “Like the man who appointed him, Kavanaugh should be impeached.”
Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said he supported using “any appropriate constitutional mechanism” against Kavanaugh.
At the time that Coons reported Stier’s allegation to the FBI director, the White House and Senate Republican leaders had directed the bureau to reopen Kavanaugh’s background check. They acted under pressure from three undecided Republican senators who wanted an investigation of the allegations made by Ford and Ramirez.
The Judiciary Committee’s Republican majority gave the FBI a week and said agents could interview four people. The list was later expanded to 10 people at the insistence of the swing-vote senators.
Lawyers for Ford and Ramirez, however, sent letters to Wray that, together, named more than 50 individuals that the bureau’s agents should interview. Only nine were ever contacted — all of them from the list that the Republicans had submitted.
One of the letters named the woman in the incident Stier said he witnessed.
“We have been advised that while at Yale, Mr. Kavanaugh exposed himself” to the woman “and forced her to touch his penis. Witnesses were present and we have been advised that they will be contacting the FBI with their first-hand accounts,” the letter said.
Stier knew both Kavanaugh and the young woman and has told people that he is certain of their identities. According to his account, two drunken male students dragged the woman toward Kavanaugh, who was also intoxicated and standing with his penis exposed, amid much laughter from the men.
The FBI’s reopened background check, which began late on Friday, Sept. 28, lasted less than a week.
The following Saturday, Oct. 6, the Senate confirmed Kavanaugh by a largely party-line vote of 50-48, the narrowest margin of support for a new justice since 1881.

PURDUE FILES FOR BANKRUPTCY, BUT THE FIGHT ISN’T OVER: Purdue Pharma filed for bankruptcy late Sunday night after facing about 2,600 lawsuits for its role in the opioid crisis.
The manufacturer of OxyContin will pay $10 billion to settle lawsuits with 24 state attorneys general and officials from five territories. The money will go toward treatment for people who have become addicted to opioids, and to help pay for overdose-reversal drugs.
But the company is poised to provide its own overdose antidote to patients. One of the drugs it mentioned was nalmefene hydrochloride, which is moving through fast-track approval at the Food and Drug Administration. The company will also support the development of a naloxone nasal spray that can be sold over the counter, and will provide those medicines to patients as well.
Twenty-six states who sued are not accepting the terms of the deal and want to go ahead with holding the Sacklers — who own the company — responsible for the crisis, as the settlement would not have the Sacklers or Purdue admit to any wrongdoing. Under the bankruptcy agreement reached with other states, the company would continue to operate but profits would go toward paying the settlement.
OxyContin has netted $35 billion in sales since its launch in 1996, and the opioid crisis is estimated to cost the U.S. $115 billion. OxyContin, a long-lasting painkiller, is blamed for being overprescribed and causing addictions among millions of people who later turned to more available, illicit street drugs, such as heroin and fentanyl.
As part of the settlement, the owners of Purdue will have to transfer its assets to a trust and a new company will form. The Sackler family will contribute a minimum of $3 billion.
“This settlement framework avoids wasting hundreds of millions of dollars and years on protracted litigation, and instead will provide billions of dollars and critical resources to communities across the country trying to cope with the opioid crisis,” Steve Miller, chairman of Purdue’s board of directors, said in a statement. “We will continue to work with state attorneys general and other plaintiff representatives to finalize and implement this agreement as quickly as possible.”

NEW YORK FOLLOWS MICHIGAN ON E-CIGARETTE BAN: Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has announced his administration will use an emergency order to ban flavored e-cigarettes. The announcement comes after Michigan made a similar move and after the Trump administration said it would move to ban flavored e-cigarettes given the rise in teen vaping and the outbreak of a mysterious illness that appears linked to vaping. States are able to move faster than the federal government or to impose other restrictions, such as adding taxes or prohibiting marketing.
Anti-tobacco group warns New York will fall short: The Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, Matthew Myers, said the order should also ban mint and menthol-flavored e-cigarettes.
CMS BLAMES OBAMACARE FOR RISE IN UNINSURED: Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Seema Verma said Friday in a blog post that critics of President Trump were mistaken in blaming him for the increase in the share of the population that had become uninsured from 2017 to 2018. The data, released last week by the Census Bureau, found 1.9 million more people joined the ranks of the uninsured.
Verma said Obamacare was to blame because the data showed 1.1 million people making above 400% of the federal poverty level had become uninsured. This outcome would help explain why the number of uninsured went up even during a strong economy. Even people who had been on Medicaid before could lose coverage because they no longer qualified, but wouldn’t necessarily get insurance through work or turn to the Obamacare exchanges. The cost of health insurance is out of reach for middle-income people who don't qualify for subsidies and have dropped out of the Obamacare marketplaces.
The data tell a few different stories. For instance, the results could also signal the impact of the Trump administration's immigration policies, which discourage immigrants from seeking public services, such as Medicaid, when they're seeking legal status. The data show that the decreases in the insured were most pronounced among Hispanics, who saw a decrease in coverage of 1.6 percentage points.
BIDEN PROMISES TO RELEASE HEALTH RECORDS AHEAD OF THE IOWA CAUCUSES: Presidential candidate Joe Biden told reporters Friday that he will release his medical records ahead of February’s Iowa caucuses, saying that there was “no reason for me not to.” Reporters have speculated about Biden’s health since he announced his campaign.
At 76 years old, Biden would be the oldest president to take the Oval Office. Most recently at a town hall on climate change, a blood vessel in his eye broke, taking the focus away from the topic of discussion. Benign or not, it brought attention to what could be other health issues, including several verbal gaffes over the past few months.
The last time he released his records was in 2008, when doctors found he had an irregular heartbeat. Biden has dealt with various health issues in the past, from two aneurysms in 1988 to a benign polyp discovered during a colonoscopy in 1996. Nevertheless, Biden was jovial Friday when he told reporters he would release his medical records. "What are the concerns?” he asked. “Man, want to wrestle?"
PRESERVED REMAINS OF THOUSANDS OF ABORTED FETUSES IN ILLINOIS HOME OF EX-ABORTION DOCTOR: After Indiana abortion doctor Ulrich Klopfer died, his family found medically preserved remains of 2,246 aborted fetuses in his home. The family searched Klopfer’s home in Illinois after he died Sept. 3, and found the remains among his possessions and immediately called the authorities.
Klopfer was a practicing abortion provider at Women's Pavilion in South Bend, Indiana, during presidential candidate Mayor Pete Buttigieg’s term before his medical license was suspended in 2015 for reportedly performing an abortion on a 13-year-old girl.
Klopfer’s case drew comparisons to notorious abortion doctor Kermit Gosnell: A Phildelphia abortion doctor, Kermit Gosnell, infamously faced trial and was convicted in Philadephia in 2013 of first-degree murder of three infants born alive after botched abortions, of involuntary manslaughter of a mother, and felony counts for violating Pennsylvania’s ban on abortions after 24 weeks. He ran the Women's Medical Society in West Philadelphia for decades even though he was not a certified ob/gyn. Grand jury reports from the trial describe a gruesome facility and even more gruesome crimes that sometimes included “snipping” infants’ spinal cords.
FORMER PLANNED PARENTHOOD CEO SAYS HEALTH ORGANIZATION IS TRYING TO ‘BUY MY SILENCE’: Dr. Leana Wen, who was the CEO of Planned Parenthood for less than a year before being ousted, said the organization is withholding her health insurance and severance pay as “ransom” to make her sign a confidentiality agreement. In a letter to the Board of Directors obtained by the New York Times, Wen wrote: “No amount of money can ever buy my integrity and my commitment to the patients I serve.” Planned Parenthood senior vice president for communications Melanie Newman said Wen’s allegations that the organization is trying to silence her are “unfortunate, saddening, and simply untrue.”

Michelle Goldberg: Margaret Atwood’s dystopia, and ours

Texto completo: After Donald Trump’s election, sales of “The Handmaid’s Tale,” Margaret Atwood’s canonical 1985 novel of theocratic totalitarianism, spiked, along with other dystopian classics like George Orwell’s “1984.”
Atwood’s book takes place in a world where a clique of Christian fundamentalists have overthrown the U.S. government and instituted the rigidly patriarchal Republic of Gilead. Environmental calamity has left many people infertile, and an unfortunate class of women who can have children, the Handmaids, are stripped of their identities and consigned to reproductive slavery for the elite.
It’s hardly surprising that in 2016 the book resonated with people — particularly women — stunned that a brazen misogynist, given to fascist rhetoric and backed by religious fundamentalists, was taking power despite the wishes of the majority of the population. As the Trump administration proceeded, and once unthinkable things became unremarkable, Atwood’s classic seemed more and more prescient.
In “The Handmaid’s Tale,” a mother trying to flee across the border to Canada has her daughter snatched from her arms. Doctors who perform abortions are hanged as murderers. I don’t know if that felt far-fetched in 1985, but in 2019 Alabama passed a law making most abortions a crime punishable by up to 99 years in prison.
“This may not seem ordinary to you now, but after a time it will,” Aunt Lydia, a villainous enforcer for the Gilead regime, tells women being forcibly conscripted as Handmaids. In Trump’s America, “The Handmaid’s Tale” came to represent determination to not let that happen, a determination also represented by the Resistance refrain, “This is not normal.” (You don’t hear that phrase much anymore; Aunt Lydia’s words were truer than many of us realized.)
At the first Women’s March, protesters carried signs with slogans like, “Make Margaret Atwood fiction again!” and “‘The Handmaid’s Tale’s’ not an instruction manual!” A TV adaptation of the novel, which debuted on Hulu in April 2017, had been in the works before the election, but it gained a new gravity.
“It’s not that anything in the script changed. But the frame changed, so that people were going to see it differently,” Atwood told me last year, when I had the chance to interview her onstage at the Women in the World summit.
Soon, the Handmaids’ costume was adopted by feminist protesters all over the country, and in several other parts of the world.
You could argue that all this is melodrama; living under Trump may be degrading, but American women are incomparably freer than those in, for example, Saudi Arabia, a society that seems far closer to Gilead than our own. Then again, in “The Handmaid’s Tale,” America hadn’t crumbled all at once. Recalling her old existence, the book’s heroine wondered at how normal life went on even as horrors filled the newspapers. “Nothing changes instantaneously: In a gradually heating bathtub, you’d be boiled to death before you knew it,” she said.
In the rise of reactionary populism in the West, Atwood herself saw a shrinking distance between reality and the world she’d imagined. “Instead of moving away from Gilead, we started moving towards it, especially in the United States,” she said in London Tuesday. In February 2017, she said, she informed her publisher she was writing a “Handmaid’s Tale” sequel.
That triumphant and long-awaited new novel, “The Testaments,” came out this week. It would be a literary event in any period; in ours, it’s a cultural phenomenon. Atwood launched the book with a sold-out live event at London’s National Theater that was broadcast at around 1,000 cinemas around the world. Readers lined up at bookstores at midnight ahead of its release, like kids awaiting the new “Harry Potter.” Reviews have been mostly glowing. It’s been shortlisted for the Booker Prize.
Naturally, “The Testaments” is being mined for insights into our current predicament. That’s the point of dystopias — to figure out where society might be going. But here’s what’s shocking about the book: Rather than a warning, it reads, in 2019, like wish fulfillment. Instead of a new glimpse of hell, it’s a riveting and deeply satisfying escapist fantasy. Gilead is far more barbarous than all but a few contemporary societies, but it’s vulnerable in a way that modern populist autocracies are not, because even if women have little power in Gilead, truth does.
“The Handmaid’s Tale” came out near the end of the Cold War, and Atwood has said she was inspired by mid-20th-century works of anti-totalitarian speculative fiction like “1984” and Ray Bradbury’s “Fahrenheit 451.” These books depict closed, airless societies, where despots control access to information, which is charged with tremendous importance. In “1984,” history has been obliterated. In “Fahrenheit 451,” all books are banned, while in “The Handmaid’s Tale” reading is illegal for (most) women. The regimes in these books are smothering and all-encompassing, but facts could, at least theoretically, endanger them.
For a long time, the notion that truth threatens totalitarianism was taken for granted. In the Soviet Union, the regime jammed foreign radio broadcasts, and people risked prison to pass around forbidden books.
“Living within the lie can constitute the system only if it is universal,” wrote Vaclav Havel in 1978, a decade before he became the first post-Communist president of what was then Czechoslovakia. He continued: “There are no terms whatsoever on which it can coexist with living within the truth, and therefore everyone who steps out of line denies it in principle and threatens it in its entirety.”
This is the case in Gilead, and it’s what gives words their salvific potential. The heroine of “The Handmaid’s Tale” describes herself as “ravenous for news,” and is sustained by the mock Latin phrase “Nolite te bastardes carborundorum,” which translates to “Don’t let the bastards grind you down.” It is scratched, presumably by one of her predecessors, on the floor of the closet in the room where she sleeps. (This phrase has since become totemic, reproduced on T-shirts and in tattoos, necklaces and needlepoint.)
Words are even more important in “The Testaments.” (If you don’t want spoilers, you should stop reading now.) One of the book’s great surprises is that the seemingly fanatical Aunt Lydia is actually part of the resistance inside the Gilead Administration, and she does a better job of it than the anonymous Trump official who wrote The New York Times Op-Ed essay. An opportunist rather than a true believer, she joined the new regime to avoid being killed by it, and though she’s complicit in its crimes, she helps take it down by publishing its secrets.
Like “The Handmaid’s Tale,” “The Testaments” has a coda set far in the future, at a Gileadean studies academic symposium. The information released by Aunt Lydia, a scholar said, “touched off the so-called Ba’al Purge that thinned the ranks of the elite class, weakened the regime, and instigated a military putsch as well as a popular revolt.” It’s this that makes “The Testaments” feel so optimistic. Imagine: a world where exposing the misdeeds of a regime could unravel it!
That’s been a constant hope of the Trump years. Those who abhor him have dreamed of seeing his depravity and corruption proven in a way that can’t be denied, whether with the fabled pee tape, the Mueller report or rumored outtakes from “The Apprentice” where he’s said to spout racial slurs. Yet again and again, Trump’s depravity and corruption are proven in a way that can’t be denied, and it doesn’t matter.
We’ve all heard him boasting of sexual assault on tape. The Mueller report found that the Trump campaign “expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts.” A Times investigation documented abundant evidence of tax fraud by Trump, and showed that he owes much of his wealth to his father. Prosecutors said he directed hush money payments to a pornographic film actress and a former Playboy model, campaign finance crimes that helped land his former attorney in prison. You don’t need a secret recording to prove the president is a racist; the evidence is on Twitter.

Texto completo: Democrats called Sunday for a new investigation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh in response to a New York Times piece that revealed a new allegation of sexual assault against him and suggested the FBI did not thoroughly probe previous claims during his confirmation process.
Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro, both Democratic presidential candidates, pushed for Kavanaugh's impeachment.
Harris had voted against Kavanaugh's confirmation in October, a process during which Christine Blasey Ford accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct while they were high school students in the 1980s.
Kavanaugh vehemently denied the claim during what became a bitter confirmation process, which catapulted the debate over the sexual assault allegations into daily conversation amid the #MeToo movement. It also prompted a backlash among those who felt the Supreme Court nominee was being unfairly judged for something that may or may not have happened over three decades ago.
Those debates were reignited this weekend with the Saturday evening publication of the Times piece.
"He was put on the Court through a sham process and his place on the Court is an insult to the pursuit of truth and justice," Harris said in a tweet. "He must be impeached."
President Donald Trump, meanwhile, accused the "LameStream Media" and Democrats of working together to scare Kavanaugh "into turning Liberal."
Trump also said Sunday on Twitter that Kavanaugh should "start suing people" or the Justice Department "should come to his rescue."
"The lies being told about him are unbelievable. False Accusations without recrimination. When does it stop? They are trying to influence his opinions. Can't let that happen!" Trump tweeted.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., wrote that the "far left's willingness to seize on completely uncorroborated and unsubstantiated allegations during last year's confirmation process was a dark and embarrassing chapter for the Senate."
Kavanaugh was confirmed in a 50-to-48 Senate vote.
The Times piece was adapted from the upcoming book "The Education of Brett M. Kavanaugh: An Investigation" and included new information that the two reporters who wrote it said showed evidence supporting a previously unreported claim. They also said they corroborated a prior claim of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh. And they said the FBI interviewed none of the potential witnesses.
Deborah Ramirez, a Yale classmate of Kavanaugh's, had alleged during his confirmation process that he had exposed himself to her in college. Her account had received less attention than Ford's at the time of his confirmation, though. Ford had testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
"During his Senate testimony, Mr. Kavanaugh said that if the incident Ms. Ramirez described had occurred, it would have been 'the talk of campus.' Our reporting suggests that it was," Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly wrote in the Times essay.
The reporters said that at least seven people they interviewed had heard about the incident, including the alleged victim's mother.
Yet, Pogrebin and Kelly said, the FBI "interviewed none of them, though we learned many of these potential witnesses tried in vain to reach the F.B.I. on their own."
The FBI interviewed fewer than a dozen people - most of them from Kavanaugh's high school days.
Castro said in a tweet on Sunday, "It's more clear than ever that Brett M. Kavanaugh lied under oath. He should be impeached. And Congress should review the failure of the Department of Justice to properly investigate the matter."
Former Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., said Sunday on NBC News' "Meet the Press" that she is not sure how Democrats should proceed on the new revelations about the FBI background checks.
"That was such a mess. And what it did for those of us who were running, it crystallized how bad Washington is. So if you were of Washington at that moment, frankly, the party didn't matter as much as the fact that you were part of that mess. And the mess really occurred because the information that needed to be investigated came out so late. And then it looked like a kneecap even though there were reasons it was late. I'm not sure good ones," she said.
"But if the information had come out early, I think you could've seen a full-thrown FBI investigation. But this isn't going away if the FBI never even bothered to talk to people surrounding this woman's allegation."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump vigorously defended Brett Kavanaugh on Sunday following a new allegation of sexual misconduct during the Supreme Court justice's college years, as some leading Democratic presidential contenders raised fresh suspicions that Kavanaugh was untruthful during last year's Senate hearings leading to his confirmation to the high court.
In an early-morning tweet, Trump called on the Justice Department to "come to Kavanaugh's rescue," and accused critics of trying to deter the justice from rulings favorable to the administration. The president's angry ripostes came a day after The New York Times reported that a male former classmate at Yale had told the FBI about witnessing an episode similar to, but separate from, an already publicized account by a female classmate, Deborah Ramirez, who said an inebriated Kavanaugh had thrust his penis in her face during a Yale party in the 1980s.
The authors of The New York Times story said Kavanaugh did not speak to them about the newly reported allegation.
Last year's contentious confirmation hearings were dominated by allegations that Kavanaugh, as a student at an elite prep school in the Washington suburbs, sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford, then a younger girl who went to school nearby.
Despite compelling testimony by Ford, who went on to become an academic in Northern California, Kavanaugh vehemently denied any wrongdoing, and with the backing of the White House and Trump allies like Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), his nomination was approved, thus cementing a conservative majority on the Supreme Court.
Many of the Democrats who want to challenge Trump in 2020 have frequently referred to the string of sexual-misconduct allegations against the president himself, but there has been little appetite for making the Kavanaugh case a major campaign talking point, in part because the episode was so polarizing. In the ensuing months, the president has often invoked the case at fiery rallies, insisting that Kavanaugh was the wronged party.
But with the campaign season now underway in earnest, the previous allegations, coupled with newly reported information, are again becoming part of the discourse.
Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Kamala Harris of California both called for impeachment proceedings against Kavanaugh, with Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont saying he supported "any appropriate constitutional mechanism" being used against the newest justice.
Warren tweeted that the new allegation was "disturbing," adding: "Like the man who appointed him, Kavanaugh should be impeached." Harris declared on Twitter that "Brett Kavanaugh lied to the U.S. Senate and most importantly to the American people," and Sanders said on Twitter that he should never have been nominated.
Democratic hopefuls Beto O'Rourke and Julian Castro also echoed the impeachment call.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat who, like Harris, sits on the Judiciary Committee and is seeking the Democratic nomination, repeated her deep misgivings about Kavanaugh in an interview Sunday on ABC's "This Week," citing his judicial views on the power of the presidency as well as the past and current sexual misconduct allegations.
But Klobuchar said that before impeachment proceedings could be considered, senators would need to examine documents relating to the administration's decision-making surrounding the FBI probe called after Ford's allegations were aired.
Backers of Trump and Kavanaugh quickly rallied to the defense of both men. Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, also appearing on "This Week," said the newly surfaced allegation recalls the "shameful circus" of last year's hearings. He predicted at "the next Democratic debate, they'll all be saying impeach Kavanaugh, impeach Trump - there's nobody they don't want to impeach."
On Twitter, Trump blasted "Radical Left Democrats and their Partner, the LameStream Media" for targeting Kavanaugh and "talking loudly of their favorite word, impeachment."
"He is an innocent man who has been treated HORRIBLY," Trump wrote in one tweet. In another, he urged that the justice sue for "liable," later correcting the spelling to "libel." Trump also accused Kavanaugh critics of acting out of unhappiness over high court rulings.
"They are trying to influence his opinions," the president tweeted.
Many commentators, however, called the situation yet another troubling instance of the president seeking to politicize the Justice Department and federal law enforcement by calling on the department to intercede on Kavanaugh's behalf.
The New York Times article focused on Ramirez's student days and her account of a party at which Kavanaugh, then a freshman, "pulled down his pants and thrust his penis at her, prompting her to swat it away and inadvertently touch it." The story said the FBI had failed to interview witnesses who may have been able to provide corroborating testimony, and that the paper's 10-month investigation suggested there was evidence to support Ramirez's account.
The New York Times also disclosed a previously unreported allegation: "A classmate, Max Stier, saw Mr. Kavanaugh with his pants down at a different drunken dorm party, where friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student." The article said Stier, who heads a nonprofit organization in Washington, has not come forward publicly with his account, but notified senators and the FBI at the time.
The authors of the Times story said Kavanaugh declined to answer questions about Stier's account, and the article said the FBI did not investigate his claim.

WATCH WHAT YOU EAT THE LEFT EXCELS IN DOUBLE STANDARDS

Texto completo: As George Orwell once noted, "The worst advertisement for socialism is its adherents."
According to Orwell, the typical socialist is "either a youthful snob-Bolshevik ... or, still more typically, a prim little man with a white-collar job, usually a secret teetotaler, and often with vegetarian leanings."
Orwell wrote those words in 1937, but they're entirely recognizable today, especially the line about vegetarianism. There's something about the people on the left that makes them highly neurotic about food. That's been true for generations, but there's evidence the impulse is getting worse.
During CNN's recent marathon climate change debate, the hosts asked the Democratic candidates if they would support changing our country's dietary guidelines, known as the food pyramid, to reduce red meat and thereby reduce global warming. Sen. Elizabeth Warren agreed: "Look, there are a lot of ways that we try to change our energy consumption. ... Some of it is with lightbulbs, some of it is on straws, some of it, dang, is on cheeseburgers, right?"
Catch that? Ms. Warren says you eat too many cheeseburgers - as if it's any of her business. But that's the thing: She actually thinks it is her business. They all think that. The activist left seeks to control everything you do, including what you put in your mouth.
For the past few years, they've been pushing you to eat bugs. Recall this headline from The Washington Post: "Eating bugs can help the environment." Or this one from The New York Times: "Why aren't we eating more insects?" Bizarre. Why would they want you to eat insects? Because it's repulsive and un-American, of course, and therefore, in the eyes of the left, it must be awesome. The more perverse and unnatural the better. That's always been the left's standard.
Given that, we shouldn't be surprised by what recently happened on Swedish television when a researcher and professor named Magnus Soderlund unveiled his plan to fight climate change. According to Mr. Soderlund, eating insects isn't enough. Cutting greenhouse gas emissions may require us to develop a taste for human flesh. Yes, it is time to practice eco-cannibalism.
Mr. Soderlund noted that, unfortunately, many people might balk at cannibalism. They're just too uptight and middle-class. He suggested baby steps to open their minds: They can start by eating their own pets. Have a cocker spaniel burger. It's for the planet.
The Swedes, we should note, are several years ahead of us in their climate-consciousness. We'll get there soon. And when we do, it'll be due to the tireless evangelizing of eco-prophets like Father Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind.. As Mr. Buttigieg noted the other night, God himself strongly agrees with every word he utters:
"You know, if you believe that God is watching as poison is being belched into the air of creation and people are being harmed by it, countries are at risk of vanishing in low-lying areas, what do you suppose God thinks of that? I bet he thinks it's messed up. ... At least one way of talking about this is that it's a kind of sin."
Got that? Disagreeing with Father Pete is a sin - or as Episcopalians like Father Pete put it, "a kind of sin." Whatever. It's bad. What apparently is not a sin is flying on private jets, which Father Pete does more than any other Democratic candidate. Of course, if you wound up within 50 feet of a chartered airplane, the left would denounce you as a heartless plutocrat who's killing the Earth. But when they fly private, it's different. It's necessary, virtuous even! Two standards: one for them, another for everyone else. They're like that about everything. This, for example, is Father Pete needling the rest of us proles about our naughty plastic straw habit:
Mr. Buttigieg: "I think we're thinking about it mostly through the perspective of guilt. From using a straw to eating a burger, 'Am I part of the problem?' And in a certain way, yes, but the most exciting thing is that we can all be part of the solution."
When you use a drinking straw, says Father Pete, you're part of the problem. Unless you happen to be Pete Buttigieg himself and you find yourself at the Iowa State Fair, in which case you can eat all the meat you want and, yes, drink from a plastic straw.
Straws for me but not for thee. Don't like it? Tough. Stop whining and eat your insects. Or your pets. Or your neighbors.
We're heading out to get a cheeseburger.

From Bad to Worse for Juul

Texto completo: Each week, we review the week's news , offering analysis about the most important developments in the tech industry.
Greetings from the alternate reality we call Silicon Valley. I'm Nicole Perlroth. Here's a look at the week's tech news:
Uber's very bad, horrible, no good day
Arguably, the biggest news to come out of the Apple event on Tuesday was Uber's layoffs. Usually anytime Apple unveils anything new, it dominates the entire week's tech news cycle. But Uber stole Apple's thunder, and not in a good way.
Soon after Apple executives unveiled their latest shiny objects -- lower-priced iPhones, a new iPad and a $ 5-a-month streaming service -- Uber announced that it had laid off nearly 8 percent of its global product and engineering group, its second round of layoffs in less than three months.
By late Tuesday, the day had gotten worse for the ride-hailing service after California legislators approved a landmark bill requiring companies like Uber and Lyft to treat their contract workers as employees.
The bill, which is expected to go into effect Jan. 1, would guarantee employment benefits, like a minimum wage, overtime and workers' compensation to hundreds of thousands of independent contractors. It would also drive up costs for companies like Uber, which is already bleeding billions of dollars in losses.
California's Assembly Bill 5 could reshape the gig economy and would apply to the entire constellation of on-demand, internet companies that popped up over the past decade: Instacart, Postmates, DoorDash and any company that counts on independent contractors for work that is part of their regular business.
Uber, Lyft and DoorDash previously pledged $ 90 million to try to block the law. On Wednesday, Uber's chief legal officer, Tony West -- surprising the many, many people who have hailed a ride with Uber's service -- said that the company did not expect to have to reclassify its drivers as full-time employees because they are not core to its business.
Uber's business isn't providing rides, Mr. West said, but simply "serving as a technology platform for several different types of digital marketplaces."
He added that Uber was "no stranger to legal battles."

He's baaaaack
Andreessen Horowitz, the venture capital firm, is backing Palmer Luckey's virtual wall start-up at a $ 1 billion-plus, unicorn valuation. This is the same Palmer Luckey who left Facebook after it was revealed that he was backing right-wing internet trolls and anti-Hillary Clinton meme factories in 2016.
Mr. Luckey's surveillance start-up, Anduril, has gone where many Silicon Valley tech workers have refused to go. The start-up, which is also backed by the Palantir co-founders Joe Lonsdale and Peter Thiel, is testing digital cameras and artificial intelligence technology that tracks people crossing the southern border.
Tech workers have made clear in recent months that they want no part of similar military and surveillance projects. In June, Google said it would not renew a Pentagon contract after thousands of its employees protested and some resigned. Employees at Microsoft and Salesforce have similarly protested the companies' projects with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Andreessen Horowitz, which eagerly offers up investors for interviews timed to such funding announcements, has been unusually tight-lipped on its investment in Anduril.
For a deeper dive on "virtual" border wall technology, read my colleague Cade Metz's excellent article last year.

About that sky-high Juul valuation
The Trump administration announced plans to ban the sale of non-tobacco-flavored e-cigarettes just one year after Juul Labs, the dominant e-cigarette company, raised money from the tobacco giant Altria at a $ 16 billion valuation.
Juul's soaring valuation has been a windfall for hedge funds, including Tiger Global Management, Darsana Capital Partners, D1 Capital Partners, Marianas Fund Management and Coatue Management; the mutual fund Fidelity Investments; and venture capital investors like Tao Capital Partners.
The proposed ban could send Juul's valuation into a free fall. But a Juul spokesman told The New York Times that it would comply. "We strongly agree with the need for aggressive category-wide action on flavored products," said Ted Kwong, the spokesman.
The administration's announcement followed news that a sixth person in the United States had died from a vaping-related lung illness. Officials are still investigating at least 450 illnesses across 33 states. It would follow similar bans by Michigan, which this month became the first state to prohibit the sales of most flavored e-cigarettes, and San Francisco, which in June became the first major American city to ban e-cigarettes. And Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City, weighed in on Tuesday, announcing a $ 160 million push to ban flavored e-cigarettes.

Texto completo: Monday brought the welcome news that National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration career leaders are pushing back against political interference with weather forecasts. Craig McLean, the acting chief scientist, is investigating the agency’s apparent attempts to defend President Donald Trump’s inaccurate statements about the danger to Alabama from Hurricane Dorian. And another career civil servant, National Weather Service Director Louis Uccellini, publicly defended the “integrity of the forecasting process.”
Weather forecasting should never be political. The National Weather Service, an agency within NOAA, issues forecasts and warnings that are based on science and focused squarely on public safety. For more than a century, the agency has played a vital role in protecting the lives and property of Americans across the country.
To be effective, NWS forecasts and warnings need to be accurate, timely and clear. Everyone — citizens, airline officials, farmers, fishermen, city officials and emergency managers — relies on the NWS to provide trustworthy information. Even a hint that a forecast or warning was influenced by politics would undermine the public’s trust and the ability to respond quickly and effectively under potentially life-threatening conditions.
If political appointees overrule trained scientists, imposing political concerns on scientific matters, they endanger public safety as well as the credibility and morale of the agency charged with protecting that safety.
That is apparently what happened last week. As the potentially dangerous weather conditions caused by Hurricane Dorian rapidly evolved, NOAA officials in Washington overrode sound science and undercut NWS professionals, apparently to provide cover for the president, who on Sept. 1 had posted inaccurate information on Twitter. Worse, NOAA officials, in an unsigned statement, had the gall on Friday to chastise NWS forecasters in Birmingham, Alabama, for telling the public — correctly — that Alabama was not actually in danger.
The impetus for the reprimand might have come from high in the Trump administration: The New York Times on Monday reported that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who heads the department responsible for NOAA, threatened to fire agency officials after the Birmingham office contradicted the president.
It was bad enough that Trump’s warning to Alabamians of a serious risk from Hurricane Dorian was woefully outdated. But it would be appalling if NOAA political appointees sought to defend his mistake, while castigating the NWS office for accurately reassuring Alabamians that they were not in danger.
NOAA has a scientific integrity policy for a reason — to prevent politics from interfering with the discovery, use and communication of scientific information, and to deal with violations of its standards. Moreover, manipulating weather information can be a federal offense. To restore public trust in weather forecasts and warnings, every step should be taken to learn from this distortion of truth and breach of trust.

Texto completo: La vida como agente de la Patrulla Fronteriza (CBP) es insoportable desde que Donald Trump es presidente de Estados Unidos.
Un reporte del New York Times, recoge testimonios sobre lo poco llevadero que ha sido el trabajo de cientos de agentes desde que las políticas antiinmigrantes de Trump se aplican.
Varios reconocieron que están cansados de ser llamados “asesinos de niños” o “vendidos” por los ciudadanos. Algunos solamente comen su almuerzo en restaurantes “amigables con la Patrulla Fronteriza “.
El reportaje, el principal de la edición dominical del diario neoyorquino, también revela que la agencia tiene que lidiar con decenas de renuncias.
“Enjaular personas por actividades que no eran violentas me comía vivo”, dijo un hombre de Arizona que renunció hace un año.
El exagente Chris Harris, que estuvo 21 años en la CBP dijo que lo más difícil para ellos ha sido pasar de ser un grupo al que nadie le daba importancia a uno odiado por la población.
“La moral era pobre en el pasado, pero ahora está en un abismo. Conozco a muchos que quieren irse “, dijo Harris al Times.
La naturaleza del trabajo ha pasado de vigilar la frontera en puntos específicos a atender emergencias médicas y proveer alimentos a bebés, entre otros ejemplos.
La CBP además sufre con problemas de reclutamiento. El artículo dice que tiene 1,800 agentes menos de lo esperado. Agentes se quejan de la falta de infraestructura o dinero para operar lo que ellos asocian como una crisis humanitaria en la frontera.
Un gran número de agentes lamenta la separación de menores o la detención en jaulas de personas enfermas.

Texto completo: In the four centuries of the Atlantic slave trade, about 12.5 million Africans were brought against their will to the New World. What percentage of that number landed in the colonies that became the United States?
When I spring this question on people, the usual response is in the range of 90%. Occasionally someone who realizes that slavery was widespread in the New World will guess 50%. According to the best available data, the correct answer is less than 4%.
What's the point? First, in the 1800s and earlier, there were, unfortunately, many countries where slavery was legal. Slavery was widespread in Asia and Africa, including North Africa, where more than a million Europeans were enslaved by Muslims after being seized in the Mediterranean.
Second, slavery in the New World was fundamentally an economic institution. During the Atlantic slave trade, 44% of slaves landed in Brazil and 33% in British and French colonies in the Caribbean, because that's where the sugar plantations were located. Sugar can't be grown in most of the area that became the U.S.
At that time, the key American crops - cotton and tobacco - weren't nearly as profitable as sugar, which is the main reason that relatively few slaves were brought to colonial Virginia, Maryland and the Carolinas.
That slavery existed in many countries that are poor today suggests that slavery is no guarantee of economic growth. That many countries, including Canada, Japan and the countries of western Europe, that are rich today did not experience slavery or did so only to a very limited extent suggests that economic growth can occur without slavery.
Yet some notable academics have made the claim that, in the words of historians Sven Beckert of Harvard and Seth Rockman of Brown, "slavery was indispensable to the economic development of the United States." Similar arguments have been made in the contributions to the 1619 series being published in the New York Times. How plausible are these claims?
Economists are always skeptical that any particular industry or product is indispensable to the growth of an economy. The historical record indicates that once a country adopts a capitalist system with free markets, secure property rights and limited government, economic growth and rising living standards invariably follow. The Canadian economy closely resembles the U.S. economy. That slavery was indispensable to the U.S. economy but not to the Canadian economy seems implausible. But if slavery wasn't indispensable, might it still have been important in U.S. economic growth?
The recent debate over the effects of slavery on economic growth has focused on the Southern cotton plantations. Cotton was by far the most important U.S. export before the Civil War. In his widely discussed book, "The Half Has Never Been Told," Cornell historian Edward Baptist claims that by 1836 cotton accounted for "almost half of the economic activity in the United States."
Several economists have argued that Baptist's calculations are incorrect and, in fact, cotton accounted for only about 5% of gross domestic product. That's still a substantial amount of output from a single industry; comparable, for instance, to the contribution of the railroads during the same period.
So cotton production was important, but not crucial, to U.S. economic growth. Could cotton have been grown without using slaves? We know that before the Civil War, cotton was grown on free farms as well as on slave plantations, and after slavery was abolished, cotton was grown only on free farms. Baptist argues that plantation owners used whipping and other forms of coercion to raise the productivity of slaves above the level possible with free labor.
Again, economists disagree. Berkeley economist Richard Sutch led a group of researchers who gathered data on African American farmers in the post-Civil War South. His results show that the productivity of free African American farmers was as high as the productivity of slaves had been.
Because of soil and climate, the U.S. South had a comparative advantage in cotton production. Cotton textiles were the most important manufactured goods of the 19th century. With or without slavery, the South would have produced enormous quantities of raw cotton.
Stanford economist Gavin Wright has argued in several influential books and articles that the poor economic performance of the South after the Civil War was not due to the low productivity of free black farmers but to the lingering negative effects of slavery on the Southern educational system (it had been illegal to teach slaves to read and write) and on infrastructure, including roads, canals and railroads.
Slavery was an evil system that enriched a relatively small number of white plantation owners. Many economists who have studied the issue believe that if the slave trade and the Southern slave plantations had never existed, U.S. economic growth would have been largely unaffected.
Anthony O'Brien is a professor emeritus of economics at Lehigh University.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The nation's immigration judges lost a key leader this week, the latest in a string of departures at the top of the system amid a backlog of cases and a migrant crisis at the southwestern border.
The official, David Neal, said that he would retire from his position as head of the judges' appeals board effective Saturday. "With a heavy heart, I have decided to retire from government service," Mr. Neal wrote in a letter sent to the board Thursday and obtained by The New York Times.
He gave no reason for his abrupt departure and asked his colleagues to "keep true to your commitment to fairness and justice."
No replacement has been announced, and a Justice Department spokesman declined to comment, citing a policy to not do so on personnel matters.
Mr. Neal's decision follows a shake-up at the Executive Office for Immigration Review, the court system that adjudicates the country's immigration cases, including asylum cases. It is part of the Justice Department, not the judicial branch.
Three of its senior career officials -- MaryBeth T. Keller, the chief immigration judge; Jean King, the general counsel; and Katherine H. Reilly, the deputy director -- all left their roles this summer. Ms. King stayed at the immigration office in a different post.
Mr. Neal's departure also comes amid the backdrop of the Trump administration's efforts to curb both illegal and legal immigration, which have taxed the immigration courts, the criminal courts and border patrols along the nation's southwestern border and prompted long-running discontent among immigration judges that they are being used to expedite deportations.
As Mr. Trump has sought to suppress immigration and cut down on the number of people who claim asylum in the United States, he has notched two wins at the Supreme Court.
On Wednesday, justices said in an unsigned order that amid an ongoing legal battle, the administration could bar most Central American migrants from seeking asylum in the United States if they passed through another country and were not denied asylum there. That decision will allow the administration to effectively bar migration across the southwestern border by Hondurans, Salvadorans, Guatemalans and others who must travel through other countries to get to the United States.
And in July, the Supreme Court said that the Trump administration could use $ 2.5 billion in Pentagon money to build a barrier along the border with Mexico, which would help Mr. Trump fulfill a campaign promise to build a wall on the border to stop immigration.
Amid these hard-line policies, a vocal group of immigration judges -- part of the larger total of about 400 judges and appeals judges -- have been at loggerheads with the Trump administration for more than a year.
Leaders of the judges' union have pushed back against the imposition of quotas that they have said would expedite deportations at the expense of due process. Under former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, they accused the Justice Department of trying to turn the immigration courts into a deportation machine.
Mr. Sessions treated the judges "like immigration officers, not judges," said Paul Schmidt, a former judge in the immigration courts.
Some judges have also bristled at a recent Justice Department decision that handed over the power to rule on appeals cases to the director of the office, a political appointee. The judges saw the move as an attempt to undermine their authority.
That decision also directly impacted Mr. Neal, demoting him "in practice," by transferring his authority to decide appeals cases to the director of the office, said Ashley Tabbador, the president of the union that represents immigration judges.
"This regulation upends the entire system created to decide these cases," Ms. Tabbador said. Should the new system run into problems, "the chairman would have been held accountable. I would have quit, too, if I were in David's position."
Though they are part of the Justice Department, many immigration judges view themselves as independent arbiters of the law and believe they must act within the confines of existing immigration statutes.
They have long deliberated over whether they should be part of the Justice Department -- a debate that has intensified under President Trump.
Last month, tensions increased when a daily briefing that is distributed to federal immigration judges contained a link to a blog post that included an anti-Semitic reference and came from a website that regularly publishes white nationalists.
After the episode, the immigration review office said that it would stop sending the daily briefing and would not renew its contract with the service that provided it.

Texto completo: This year's flooding across the Midwest and the South affected nearly 14 million people, yet the full scale of the slowly unfolding disaster has been difficult to fathom. To visualize just how extensive it was, The New York Times created this composite map showing all the areas that were inundated at some point from January through June.
The blue on the map, generated from satellite data used to detect flooding, shows the estimated extent and intensity of flooding. The usual extents of rivers are shown in white. Farmland, much of which was so drenched that farmers had to delay planting, is shown in green.
Public interest in natural disasters tends to focus on big, discrete weather events like hurricanes. But flooding that unfolds over months across a broad area has a harder time breaking through. It is only when seen as a single, connected event that the stunning scale of the 2019 flood season becomes clear.
To measure the scope of the spring floods, The New York Times analyzed satellite data from the Joint Polar Satellite System using software, developed by government and academic researchers for flood detection, that is frequently used in disaster response.
The data covers the period from Jan. 15 to June 30 and shows an interconnected catastrophe along the Missouri, Mississippi and Arkansas Rivers, a system that drains more than 40 percent of the landmass of the continental United States.
The flooding started in earnest in March as heavy rains fell on frozen ground already bearing a deep load of winter snow. As the water spread across parts of South Dakota, Nebraska and Iowa, traditional defenses that communities had in place to protect against rising waters were quickly overwhelmed.
As the high water from the many tributaries of the Mississippi came together, the river became a record-breaking monster.
By the end of June, the flooding was so intense and widespread that at least 11 states had sought federal disaster funds for more than 400 counties. Forty-nine United States Geological Survey gauges measured more water this year than at any time in at least 20 years.
Bryan Tuma, assistant director of Nebraska's Emergency Management Agency, said, simply, "I would describe it as biblical."
The causes of flooding are complicated, but climate change is increasingly an exacerbating factor. Warmer air can hold more moisture, and that moisture can fall back out of the sky, whether as rain or snow, in greater amounts.
The year through May 2019 was the wettest 12-month period on record in the United States, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Nearly 38 inches of water fell, almost eight inches above average.
A Mississippi River mayors council estimated that the cost of infrastructure damage and emergency response was at least $ 2 billion. That number is likely to rise as the water recedes and officials can check the extent of the damage. The full cost to repair homes and businesses has yet to be calculated.
David Alexander, a professor of risk and disaster reduction at University College London, said that typical recovery times from major disasters are "in the range of 10 to 25 years."
Ultimately, the volume of water is only one source of damage: What's in that water also plays a role.
The waters of the Mississippi, carrying chemical fertilizers from heartland farms, lawns and other sources, have contributed to a "dead zone" in the Gulf of Mexico, an area with too little oxygen to support fish and other marine life.
NOAA predicts that this year's dead zone will be 8,717 square miles -- about the size of New Hampshire.
Back in March, Edward Clark, director of NOAA's National Water Center, said that what lay ahead was a "potentially unprecedented" flood season, even worse than the Great Flood of 1993.
In a recent interview, Mr. Clark said, with no satisfaction, "Yes, we got it right."
Sixty-three percent of comparable United States Geological Survey gauges in the region recorded higher peaks this year than in the same period of 1993.
"This is a year that will remain in our cultural memory, in our history," he said.

Texto completo: The third presidential debate experienced a robust bounce back in terms of viewership.
The debate, which occurred Thursday night, had 14 million viewers when combining the audience from the broadcasts on ABC News and Univision, according to early Nielsen Media Research. There were 4 million people in the key 25-54 age demographic.
Comparatively, July's debate, which was broadcast in two parts on CNN, averaged 8.2 million and 10.1 million in viewers and 2.4 million and 2.8 million among people aged 25-54 respectively.
The first night of the first debate, hosted by NBC, MSNBC, and Telemundo, had an audience of slightly more than 15 million viewers. The second night was even higher, coming in at 18.1 million viewers.
Thursday night's debate likely had the surge in its audience as a result of all the candidates being on one stage in one night. Former Vice President Joe Biden, who's also the 2020 favorite, had not gone up against Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren until this event.
The next debate will be at Otterbein University on Oct. 15, and it'll be hosted by CNN and the New York Times.
Fox News’ Republican primary debate in August 2015 still ranks as the highest-rated one with 24 million viewers.

HORSE RACING
Baffert denounces accusations
Hall of Fame trainer Bob Baffert denied giving 2018 Triple Crown winning horse Justify a banned substance that caused a positive test prior to last year's Kentucky Derby and blamed the result on contaminated food.
Baffert said he "unequivocally" rejects the implication he'd give Justify or any other horse scopolamine, which the colt tested positive for after winning the Santa Anita Derby in April 2018. The New York Times reported Justify tested positive for the substance and that the California Horse Racing Board did not adequately investigate the matter. Justify was allowed to continue racing and won the Kentucky Derby, Preakness and Belmont Stakes to become the 13th Triple Crown winner in history.
"Damn shame this great horse, connections and me have to be put through all this," Baffert said in a text message to The Associated Press. "It was obvious environmental contamination. It's been a known problem in California."

Miller: Iowa not part of Purdue Pharma settlement

Texto completo: A company sued by almost every U.S. state for its alleged involvement in the opioid crisis has reached a settlement, but Iowa's attorney general doesn't think the agreement is good enough.
OxyContin creator Purdue Pharma and its owners, members of the Sackler family, reached a tentative agreement involving almost 2,300 lawsuits filed by attorneys representing government entities across the county, the New York Times reported Wednesday.
The state of Iowa, however, is not a part of that proposed settlement in which the Sacklers agreed to pay $3 billion in cash over seven years.
Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller said he's concerned the Sacklers aren't paying out enough.
"I believe they have the ability and responsibility to pay more than the $3 billion they guaranteed to pay under the agreement," Miller said in a written statement Wednesday. "I will continue to evaluate the situation and (Purdue's expected) bankruptcy proceeding as it progresses."
The Iowa lawsuit seeks to provide restitution for all Iowans who paid for OxyContin since it was first made available to the public more than two decades ago, Miller said, though, when asked in May, he didn't have an estimate for what the amount would be.
"Our goal remains the same: Holding Purdue Pharma accountable for helping create a public health crisis and securing funding to assist the many Iowa victims of this tragedy," he added Wednesday.
Iowa in May joined 43 other states in suing Purdue Pharma, a pharmaceutical company accused of fueling America's deadly opioid epidemic.
"Prescription opioid deaths in Iowa have quadrupled in the past twenty years, making it one of only four states to see such a large increase," the lawsuit reads.
The Iowa Department of Public Health reported that 2,051 Iowans died in opioid-related incidents between 2000 and 2018. The number of substance-use disorder treatment admissions in Iowa has increased from 653 in 2005 to 2,506 in 2015.
Those statistics encompass many substances besides OxyContin, but the lawsuit argues that addiction can prompt users to seek out other harmful drugs, including other prescription narcotics and heroin.
State offers more details on effects in Iowa The attorney general's office earlier this month filed an amended petition to the May lawsuit, adding detailed descriptions of ways in which Iowans were exposed to OxyContin through "false, deceptive, misleading" marketing by advertisers who kept its addictive nature hidden.
The filing goes on to point fingers directly at Richard Sackler, former chairman and president of Purdue Pharma, who took the role of senior vice president of Purdue Pharma shortly after its 1991 inception.
OxyContin's history goes back more than two decades, to its 1996 launch following Food and Drug Administration approval.
Advertisements proceeded to falsely subdue fears of addiction, and sales representatives encouraged increased dosages, the recent 84-page-long filing alleges.
"The launch of OxyContin Tablets will be followed by a blizzard of prescriptions that will bury the competition," Sackler said at Purdue's national sales meeting in 1996. "The prescription blizzard will be so deep, dense and white that you will never see their white flag."
In 1999, Sackler, who discouraged the company from using the words "opioid" or "narcotic" to describe its product, became Purdue Pharma's president.
Salespeople spread across the country to advertise the product as being at low risk of causing addiction; one even describing the most significant side effect of OxyContin as being constipation, rather than respiratory depression or death.
In 1998, Purdue Pharma produced a video called "I Got My Life Back" in which it made the claim that fewer than 1% of opioids cause addiction, according to the recent filing.
The video, created in response to a pharmacy benefits manager who expressed concern that OxyContin had the potential to lead to drug abuse, was sent out to thousands of prescribers, including those in Iowa.
Purdue Pharma also created a website called "In the Face of Pain," which encouraged patients to fight policies limiting opioid access and to find doctors willing to treat their pain.
More than 3,900 Iowans visited the site between 2010 and October 2015, the new document reads.
A resource guide on the web page read: "Many people living with pain and even some healthcare providers believe that opioid medications are addictive. The truth is that when properly prescribed by a healthcare professional and taken as directed, these medications give relief — not a 'high.'"
Doctor wrote over 2,200 prescriptions in a decade, state says Sales representatives were on the front lines of the false advertising, the lawsuit alleges.
An Iowa health care provider in 2007 told a sales representative he was concerned about the "higher rate of abuse with OxyContin and patients like to snort it."
The sales representative replied that Vicodin was the most abused drug in the country, according to the new filing.
Other sales representatives in Iowa compared OxyContin to other pain managers, like ibuprofen and Tylenol, even though there wasn't medical evidence to support this.
Between 2006 and 2016, more than 10,000 coupons, which gave patients free or discounted access to OxyContin for anywhere from 30 days to a year, were used by Iowans, according to the filing.
The document also makes reference to an Iowa doctor referred to in court records as "Doctor A," who in 2018 was cited by the Iowa Board of Medicine for failure to provide appropriate pain management.
"Doctor A," one of the top OxyContin prescribers in Iowa between 2006 and 2016, wrote more than 2,200 OxyContin prescriptions, making him a valuable revenue source for Purdue Pharma and was even described as one of the company's "top targets," the filing alleges.

Baffert's responses to Justify drug claims weak

Texto completo: For two decades, Bob Baffert has worn the burden of being horse racing's most recognizable figure with reliable ease.
When the reporters and cameras gather around his barn every morning during the Triple Crown season, he'll go out of his way to shower them with soundbites. When TMZ tracks him outside a Los Angeles restaurant and asks him to predict his next Derby winner, he'll happily engage in the nonsense. He once was asked to be the celebrity guest picker on ESPN's "College GameDay," which is quite a statement in and of itself for someone who trains Thoroughbreds for a living.
It's also why so many within horse racing love him so much. In a sport where the trainers are often reluctant to court fame or publicity, Baffert – with that shock of white hair and the trademark sunglasses that make him instantly recognizable everywhere – has rarely encountered an opportunity to promote himself or the sport that he didn't take.
Which makes Baffert's response to Wednesday's explosive New York Times story about his 2018 Triple Crown winner, Justify, all the more inadequate.
Thus far, Baffert has issued two statements about the report, which details how Justify tested positive after the 2018 Santa Anita Derby for above-threshold levels of a drug called scopolamine. It also shows how the California Horse Racing Board essentially threw out the result and worked to keep the positive test from becoming public, raising significant questions about conflicts of interest with board members and whether Baffert received preferential treatment.
The first statement on Thursday morning, issued by Baffert's attorney and addressed to Times reporter Joe Drape, called the story "long on sensationalism, short on facts, and does a great disservice to Mr. Baffert, JUSTIFY, and the entire horse industry."
In a second statement attributed to Baffert himself, he denied giving scopolamine to the horse and attributed the positive test to "environmental contamination caused by the presence of Jimson Weed in feed, a naturally growing substance in areas where hay and straw are produced in California" while pointing out that Justify had clean drug tests after all three Triple Crown races.
Sorry, but that's not good enough. And it's not going to be the end of the questions surrounding Baffert and how California regulators handled the test.
The horse racing establishment is already going to work, calling Drape agenda-driven, circling the wagons to protect the legacy of its biggest human star and trying to pass this off as a process controversy rather than a massive black mark on one of the sport's all-time great achievements.
Because of what's at stake here, Baffert needs to step up and answer some questions, not hide behind coordinated talking points 15 hours after the story broke. (According to Drape, Baffert declined multiple requests to discuss the issue before the story was published, which isn't a great look either, given the seriousness of the allegations.)
Regardless of whether scopolamine enhances performance or not – that's another excuse some horse racing folks are using today – and regardless of whether 300 nanongrams per milliliter could even be attained through contamination, it's still a positive test above the threshold level allowed by California regulations. And if you're going to attribute it to the jimson weed, aren't there some obvious follow-ups here, like where did Baffert source Justify's feed and hay? Did other horses in his barn test positive for scopolamine and at similar levels? If not, that would seem to be both relevant and damning.
According to the statement from Baffert's attorney, W. Craig Robertson, however, after notification of the positive test, Robertson told California regulators he "would vigorously defend Mr. Baffert should the CHRB pursue an action to either disqualify JUSTIFY or suspend Mr. Baffert," and that the board was left with a choice to "either pursue a frivolous case that had no merit at great taxpayer expense – or exercise reason and common sense and decide to take no further action."
Does that really sound like a trainer who was eager to get to the bottom of a positive test and vigorously defend himself, or someone who was trying to run out the clock via threat before the Kentucky Derby and hope it would go away?
And that question should matter to everyone involved, because if Justify had been disqualified from the Santa Anita Derby for the positive test, he wouldn't have even qualified for the Kentucky Derby.
Because California regulators heeded Robertson's warning, we might never know what should have actually happened with Justify, and there might be no remedy available to change or even put an asterisk next to history. But as the face of the sport, Baffert's response so far doesn't even come close to answering the questions that need to be asked.

Texto completo: The Sanctuary Church near downtown Fort Lauderdale wears its heart on a flagpole by the side of Federal Highway, a flapping declaration that should not seem so provocative, "Love wins."
As we've seen in a week of a remarkable gathering and fundraising across South Florida for those displaced and nearly destroyed by Hurricane Dorian, it does. Much of this work continues to be done by folks who have come of age after 9-11, a tragedy that revealed our vestigial instinct to come together, unconditionally, to rebuild.
In recent years we have gotten more efficient in mobilizing hearts and minds in response to misfortune, both natural and man-made, in cities that for a time are represented in hashtags. Of course, this impulse is not defined by local or national borders. In the Bahamas, especially, we are reminded that as a species we want to help neighbors in distress. We need to help. These hashtags are part of a continuum. We are #HumanStrong.
Tunnel of love
Now in its eighth year in downtown Fort Lauderdale, the Stephen Siller Tunnel to Towers 5K Run & Walk returns to Huizenga Park 7:30-9:30 a.m. Saturday. A fundraiser for military and first responders injured or killed in the line of duty, the event is one of many taking place this week around the world to honor the memory of its namesake, a New York firefighter who was on his way home from a shift on Sept. 11, 2001, when the call came in that the World Trade Center was on fire. Siller turned around and, in his turnout gear, ran through the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel to the Twin Towers and immortality.
Fort Lauderdale's is one of the few runs that includes the emotional scene of firefighters weighed down by heavy protective gear running through a tunnel as Siller did. Registration is open through Friday and costs $35, ages 13-17 $20, ages 12 and younger $10, military and first responders $25. Visit Crowdrise.com/T2TFortLauderdale2019 , Facebook.com/T2TFtLauderdale or Tunnel2Towers.org.
Then, breakfast
Just across the river, Tarpon River Brewing Co. will host a T2T after-party breakfast beginning at 8 a.m., Saturday with 20 percent of the proceeds going to the Tunnel to Towers Foundation. Visit Facebook.com/TarponRiverBrewing.
Weekend movie
It's been a while since I've read a more memorably intriguing review than the one the New York Times' Manohla Dargis gave to "Give Me Liberty," beginning a weeklong run at Savor Cinema in Fort Lauderdale on Friday. For information on showtimes and tickets, visit FLIFF.com.
Directed by newcomer Kirill Mikhanovsky, a Russian immigrant who once drove a medical transport van for people with disabilities in Milwaukee, "Give Me Liberty" stars nonprofessional actors Chris Galust, as the driver of a medical transport van in Milwaukee, and Lauren Spencer, who, like the character she plays, has A.L.S. Much of the action takes place in a white-knuckle ride through the city as the always-behind Vic (Galust) hurries his passengers to their appointments, including Tracy (Spencer), with whom Vic settles into a tenderly building relationship.
Dargis called it "a jolt of a movie, at once kinetic and controlled. It's an anarchic deadpan comedy that evolves into a romance just around the time the story explodes. ... With its contrasting modes and moods, it pushes and pulls you, rocking you back and forth like one of the van's swaying passengers, creating an agreeable uncertainty. ... Mikhanovsky proves to be a virtuoso of chaos. When he plunges you into the churn it's as if he were saying, 'Isn't this mess we call life glorious?' "
Weekend laughs
From the Wayans family of comedians and actors, Shawn Wayans (the good looking one), star of "White Chicks" and "Scary Movie" (OK, the other good looking one), will do four shows Friday-Saturday at the Miami Improv in Doral. Tickets cost $30 (two-drink minimum). As you might expect, the $40 VIP tickets are gone. Visit MiamiImprov.com.
Sounds good
Steve Rullman's thoughtfully programmed survey of indie-rock experimentation, Bumblefest 2019, returns to downtown West Palm Beach on Friday and Saturday, with 36 bands on six stages. They include slinky, '60s dumpster divers the Blank Tapes, West Coast dreamer Worn-tin, groovy L.A. vocalist Winter and Brooklyn synth duo the Fantastic Plastics. Also worth your time are two recently formed South Florida supergroups that demand repeated listening, the Darling Fire and All the V Words. Bumblefest takes place on stages at Kismet Vintage, Respectable Street (inside and outside), Voltaire,Hullabaloo and Subculture Coffee. Advance tickets cost $25 for a two-day pass, $15 for a single day. Single-day tickets will cost $20 at the gate. For the band schedule and more information, visit Bumblefest.com.
Date night
Beach House Pompano will throw a '90s party 7 p.m.-to-close on Saturday, with DJ Misha and specials on drinks, which you may need. This was the decade that gave us a lot of Madonna hits, Ricky Martin's "Livin' La Vida Loca" and Montell Jordan's timeless "This Is How We Do It," but also Meatloaf's "I'd Do Anything for Love," Los Del Rio's "Macarena" and a lot of Mariah Carey hits.

Texto completo: “In prose,” scolded George Orwell in his masterful essay “Politics and the English Language,” “the worst thing you can do with words is to surrender them.” Considering the news lately, one wonders if we’ve taken this instruction a bit too literally.
Last month, the internet descended en masse to mock Ohio State University after it was revealed that the school sought to trademark the word “the.” Thanks to Josh Gerben, a sharp-eyed trademark lawyer in Washington, D.C., who spotted and publicized the trademark filing, media outlets and social media denizens took notice of the otherwise mundane goings-on at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. On Aug. 13, Gerben tweeted regarding Ohio State's filing: “The university claims that the trademark is for a brand of clothing, namely t-shirts, baseball caps, and hats.”
Originally founded as the “Ohio Agricultural and Mechanical College,” the Ohio General Assembly later passed a law in 1878 officially changing the school’s name to “The Ohio State University.” Ever since, Ohio State University graduates have enjoyed the somewhat pompous pleasure of stressing the article when referencing their alma mater and the outright insufferable habit of interjecting the word when it is neglected by the uniformed or the unwilling. (They should have stuck with OAMC, if you ask me.)
Naturally, the idea of a middling public research university with a scandal-ridden football team chronically unable to win postseason games against Southeasterly opponents attempting to lay claim to, quite literally, the most commonly used word in the English language, drew some attention. Little of it was positive. The University of Michigan, for instance, lampooned their bitter rival by tweeting a graphic featuring the school’s trademark “M” logo with the word “OF” supersized behind it and the caption, “TM.”
Then, on Aug. 31, Gerben again broke the news that a company owned by NBA superstar LeBron James had filed an application with the USPTO earlier that month seeking to trademark the phrase “Taco Tuesday.” According to the filing, James indicated his intent to build off the apparent popularity of his newly acquired practice of posting about “Taco Tuesday” on social media — which, as far as I can tell, are simply semi-frequent videos of James eating tacos on Tuesday and shouting the words at increasing volumes — by branding such content and creating a podcast under the name.
Last Wednesday, the USPTO denied both OSU’s and James' respective trademark applications, albeit for differing reasons. For Ohio State, the office issued an initial refusal of the trademark on the technical grounds that the school was not using the article in the form of a trademark (but rather as merely “ornamental”) and on the procedural grounds that Marc Jacobs had already filed an application for “the” and thus took precedence.
The reasoning for denying James & Co.’s application was somewhat different. The USPTO found the company cannot trademark “Taco Tuesday” because the phrase is “a commonplace term, message, or expression widely used by a variety of sources that merely conveys an ordinary, familiar, well-recognized concept or sentiment.” Essentially, too many people in too many places use “Taco Tuesday” to denote the fact they are eating or wish to eat the titular food on Tuesday. The office further cited a portion of the application, wherein James indicated that his plan to offer “advertising and marketing” services under the phrase, as reasoning why the claim was rejected. This was due to the fact that one other trademark exists, under “Techno Taco Tuesday,” which already offers advertising and marketing services.
For all the easy, largely harmless jokes at the expense of James and Ohio State — not to mention the accompanying clicks, likes, and retweets — what, if anything, there is to learn from trademark claims such as these is often murky. Celebrity aggrandizing? Keen business sense? Something else? Do we even care?
A trademark, per the USPTO, is a word, phrase, symbol, and/or design that identifies and distinguishes the source of the goods of one party from those of others, such as brand names, slogans, and logos. And unlike patents (which apply to inventions) and copyrights (which protect original works of authorship), trademarks do not expire after a set duration. Instead, trademark rights are protected through “use” — that is, as long as you continue to use the mark in commerce and, correspondingly, protect it from infringement use by others.
While at times trademarks, and especially certain trademark applications, may seem frivolous, they are a bulwark of free enterprise. James, for instance, is only the latest in a long line of athletes, actors, and celebrities to seek such a trademark. Tom Brady was similarly mocked for his failed attempt to procure a trademark on the phrase “Tom Terrific.” Taylor Swift famously sought trademarks for certain of her song titles and lyrics, including common phrases such as “Blank Space,” “Nice to Meet You, Where You Been?” and even “1989,” with mixed success. Examples abound.
Nor is Ohio State alone. Universities, along with numerous other entities such as professional sports franchises, commonly apply for trademarks on words and phrases associated with their institution or employees. For instance, as Gerben reported last month, the University of Southern California applied to trademark “It’s Not What You Know, It’s How You Think.” Whether they will be successful in registering such “debased language,” to return to Orwell’s scolding, has yet to be determined.
But even as such a “use” determination protects intellectual property, it also necessarily allows the space for anti-competition bullying by so-called “trademark trolls” or “patent trolls.” As the name implies, these trolls exist to collect a toll from new or potential competitors, registering up trademarks for the main purpose of suing others who may come close to infringing on its use. The practice is particularly detrimental to small businesses and startups who come up against large, established companies with the relationships and resources to scare off smaller competitors or simply bleed them dry in endless, tetchy litigation. Such was the strategy of Thomas Edison, for example, who, as a keen historical irony, is a strong contender for both America’s most celebrated inventor and most thuggish monopolist.
There’s another twist in James' case: The Wyoming-based fast-food chain Taco John’s has for 30 years held a trademark for “Taco Tuesday.” Despite the obvious commonality of the phrase, Taco John’s levies cease-and-desist warnings at restaurateurs, breweries, food trucks, and other “offenders” across the nation. Taco John’s is an exemplar of the consequence of use determination: because the USPTO granted the chain a trademark for “Taco Tuesday,” it must actively defend its trademark if it wishes it to continue. As lawyer Nikki Siesel explained to Princeonomics, “If Taco John’s is not doing a good job policing its trademark rights, it can be challenged that the mark has become generic.”
But if Taco John’s trademark rights still exist, why didn’t the USPTO deny James’s application based on the fact there is already a trademark on the phrase “Taco Tuesday?" The difference, it seems, is in intended use. By refusing to trademark the phrase because of its commonality, a spokesman for James told the New York Times last week, the federal office “essentially offered what Mr. James wanted all along: protection from liability if he used ‘Taco Tuesday’ in certain projects, like podcasts and other media.”
In other words, a central motivation for filing such a seemingly ludicrous trademark application was just to make clear James & Co. wouldn’t get sued if they continued to use the phrase as they have been. As tedious old Polonius realized, there was a method in the madness of Hamlet’s words, words, words.
There is a catch, however, that seems to have been lost in the offing. “If this opens the door for ‘Taco Tuesday’ to be open to everybody,” the spokesman told the Times, “all the better.” As ESPN reported, “James’ spokesman pointed out that the USPTO’s ruling will protect not only James but anyone else from using ‘Taco Tuesday’ for business reasons.”
Yet this is almost certainly not what was decided by the USPTO. The reason James did not run afoul of Taco John’s trademark is because his intended usage was not at the level of their business trademark. In other words, James was seeking to prove he could continue using the phrase in common speech and in social media posts as he had been previously; he was decidedly not filing a claim as a restaurant or fast-food chain, which would have certainly infringed upon Taco John’s trademark. Indeed, in the one section of the filing that James’ claim did approach a “business reason” — offering “advertising and marketing” services — the USPTO denied it on the grounds that it interfered with another business’ existing trademark.
“It is clear,” Orwell emphasized, “that the decline of a language must ultimately have political and economic causes.” Indeed, but maybe add to that the occasional well-meaning legal misunderstanding.

‘A Good Provider Is One Who Leaves’ is extraordinary, moving

Resumen: Journalist Jason DeParle chronicles the lives and labor of three far-flung generations of a Filipino family as they forge a way out of poverty.

Texto completo: Thirty years ago, as a journalist writing about poverty, Jason DeParle moved into a Manila shantytown and slept on the floor of a stranger, Tita Portagana Comodas, alongside various relatives and the scurrying rats. Before long the two weren’t strangers: Despite her imperfect English and his even worse Tagalog, not to mention their vastly different backgrounds, they became lifelong friends. Seeing Tita’s husband, Emet, and all five of their children take jobs overseas, DeParle, a reporter for The New York Times, came to grasp the importance of migration in alleviating poverty in the Philippines. The story of Tita’s extended family, set within the larger story of global migration, forms the heart of his stunning new book, “A Good Provider Is One Who Leaves: One Family and Migration in the 21st Century.”
Much of “A Good Provider” follows Tita and Emet’s daughter Rosalie, who was 15 when the author met her and who is nearly 50 now. Intelligent and quietly ambitious, she becomes a nurse, her education made possible by her father’s years working as a pool keeper in Saudi Arabia. Though her ultimate goal is to work in America, Rosalie first finds a job in Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates, where nearly the entire workforce is foreign-born.
She marries and has three children, but they are mostly raised by extended family in the Philippines while their parents work. At one point, Rosalie; her husband, Chris; and their daughter Kristina live in three different countries, “a family and a diaspora at once,” DeParle writes, “the national dilemma writ large.” After eight years in Abu Dhabi, Rosalie finally lands a nursing job in Galveston, Texas, and a coveted U.S. visa. Months later, her husband and children join her in America.
His recounting of Rosalie’s path to the U.S. makes evident the author’s intimate ties to the family. At times, he goes beyond being a journalistic observer, such as when he helps Rosalie prepare for her Skype interview for the Texas position and his intervention when her visa is held up, instances that underscore the privilege he possesses in comparison to his subjects. But DeParle is also aware that the family’s experience is part of a larger story, and he deftly alternates between their compelling saga and the broader issues surrounding migration. 
Part of that big picture pertains to the special significance of migration in the Philippines. DeParle points out that “[n]o country does more to promote migration than the Philippines, where the government trains and markets overseas workers,” and with good reason: Overseas Filipino workers sent $32 billion home in 2018 alone. While the government promotes its citizens as good-natured and hardworking, DeParle also captures the intense loneliness experienced by migrants, particularly those separated for long stretches from their children.
DeParle also charts the history of immigration in the United States, providing useful context for our current political moment. He forcefully makes the point that there is a difference between the politics of immigration, which are broken, and immigration itself, which is successful in ways that are rarely acknowledged. Much of the divisive public discourse in the U.S. focuses on illegal immigration at the southern border. Rosalie, he notes, is “the kind of immigrant who is largely invisible in political debate but increasingly common. Since 2008, the United States has attracted more Asians than Latin Americans, and nearly half of the newcomers, like Rosalie, have college degrees.” Additionally, more and more migrants are women, as wealthy countries are increasingly in need of caregiving labor. There was a nursing shortage in Galveston in the wake of Hurricane Ike, and skilled Filipinos like Rosalie helped fill it. (Nursing is more prestigious in the Philippines than in the U.S.)
In addition to being intelligent and compassionate, “A Good Provider” is evocatively written. Describing the family matriarch when they first met, DeParle observes, “Tita faced crushing poverty without being crushed.” Writing of Emet, back in Manila after several years working in the Persian Gulf but unable to earn enough in his native country to support his family, DeParle notes that “Emet’s return to Saudi felt as inevitable as gravity.”
Emet spent 20 years working on and off in Saudi Arabia, where he was often unhappy. “Ever since his orphaned childhood, all he had wanted was a family,” DeParle writes, “but to support one, he had to leave it.” When Emet finally returns home for good, his children continue the cycle, leaving the Philippines to work overseas to support their parents and their own children. (The money Rosalie sends provides Tita and Emet with two-thirds of their monthly income.)
DeParle accompanies Rosalie’s family back to the Philippines for their first visit after four years in America. The children have mostly forgotten Tagalog, and their grandparents struggle to understand them even as they’re impressed by their strong English and the success of their American lives. As they’re preparing to return to Texas, Emet, weakened by a stroke, weeps. “Maybe I won’t see you again,” he says to his daughter. The all-too-brief reunion – held in the comfortable family compound made possible by years of overseas labor – captures so much about global migration: the necessity, the pride, the heartbreak.

Looking at the campaign through Sanford’s looking glass

Resumen: The disgraced former South Carolina governor and congressman announced Sunday that he’s running against Donald Trump for the 2020 Republican nomination. The narrative-shmarrative is that Sanford is an old-school Republican whose concerns are focused on a strong, bootstrap economy and, well, that’s about it so far. Sanford’s well-reasoned concerns about the unfathomable debt, his low-key, soft-spoken style and his cool Southern manner might have made him a terrific presidential candidate in another time, especially alongside his tough, accomplished wife and central-casting sons.

Texto completo: CHARLESTON, S.C. — Once upon a time, Mark Sanford might have been a contender, but there’s too much water under the bridges that stretch from this city of steeples to his erstwhile home on Sullivan’s Island.
The disgraced former South Carolina governor and congressman announced Sunday that he’s running against Donald Trump for the 2020 Republican nomination. The third challenger to toss his hat into the wishing well of magical thinking, Sanford says he plans to talk about the skyrocketing debt, tariffs, trade and tone. Perfect. That’ll ignite the crowds and knock the grand poobah of pomp and propaganda off his game.
You can just see it: The boyish Sanford — an itinerant stranger in his own strange land — going toe to toe with the swamp-menacing Trump. It would be worth the price of a ticket. Trump’s other two GOP opponents, former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld and former Illinois Rep. Joe Walsh, may as well grab one while they last.
Nevertheless, the buzz does what buzz does. In the days following Sanford’s announcement and a series of cable-TV appearances, you’d have thought the former governor were the deus ex machina of the GOP. Recent commentary from conservatives has been dripping with so much honey you don’t know whether to build a hive or kill the drones.
The narrative-shmarrative is that Sanford is an old-school Republican whose concerns are focused on a strong, bootstrap economy and, well, that’s about it so far. Also, BIG HEADLINE, he believes in climate change and legal immigration because, what life form other than Trump’s most fervent supporters doesn’t?
Further to Sanford’s coronation as GOP savior, according to Republican strategist Liz Mair writing Monday in The New York Times, he’s a bigger threat to Trump than his co-challengers because he was never a "Never Trumper." Unlike Walsh and Weld — a strong law firm name if things go awry, as surely they will — Sanford appears to be uninterested in making the race all about Trump, even though Trump’s anti-endorsement in 2018 led to Sanford’s congressional primary defeat.
Plus, wrote Mair, Sanford is more "nuanced." Perhaps she was thinking of the subtle differences between Argentina and the Appalachian Trail, where in 2009 the then-governor Sanford told everyone through a spokesperson that he’d be hiking for a few days but instead found himself in South America with his mistress?
Mair insists that the tryst that ended Sanford’s governorship, as well as his marriage, was "the least-scandalous scandal in modern political history" because, after all, he only had an "extramarital affair because he fell in love and got engaged to the woman."
This confection would be news to South Carolinians who were appalled by his deceit and repulsed by his weepy news conference to confess his sins. Such a cavalier dismissal of a family betrayal would also be news to ex-wife Jenny Sanford, who wrote a book, "Staying True" about it.
It is absolutely true that Sanford, 59, is a time-tested conservative on budgetary matters, as my Washington Post colleague Jennifer Rubin argued under the banner headline "Mark Sanford might be the Republicans’ last chance." No one can accuse him of being a fake conservative, she wrote.
Indeed, not. As governor, Sanford was such a budget cruncher that he brought two baby pigs, one under each arm, to the statehouse to make his point about — get it? — pork.
It is quite possible that most or many Americans don’t care what Sanford did in his personal life, but the nicknamed "Luv Guv’s" philandering meanderings were public matters by virtue of two facts: The highest-ranking official of the state lied about his whereabouts and was unreachable. He simply slipped the reins of government and followed his passion, which was concerned with "issues" having nothing to do with matters of state.
It’s not the economy, it’s character. Only someone as despicable as Donald Trump could make a man like Mark Sanford palatable. Sanford’s well-reasoned concerns about the unfathomable debt, his low-key, soft-spoken style and his cool Southern manner might have made him a terrific presidential candidate in another time, especially alongside his tough, accomplished wife and central-casting sons. But that time has passed.

Texto completo: LaToya Ruby Frazier has been teaching and working out of Chicago, the city she felt destined to live in, for almost six years now. Since 2013, the photographer focused on delivering social justice through her images has won a MacArthur Foundation "genius grant," had solo exhibitions at museums in cities including Brooklyn, Boston and Seattle, and seen her work collected by many of the nation's top museums.
But not until now has she had a solo show in Chicago.
"I've been embraced really well here," said Frazier, who's 37 and an associate professor of photography at the School of the Art Institute. "And so I am excited that it is the first show and that it's a show that I think this region can really relate to."
"The Last Cruze," opening at the Renaissance Society at the University of Chicago Sept. 14, continues Frazier's tradition, developed in her hometown of Braddock, Pennsylvania, outside Pittsburgh, of examining the Rust Belt and its resonances.
Judging by the selection of black-and-white photographs that have already been published in the New York Times Magazine, it promises to be an achingly close look at workers who rolled the final Chevrolet Cruze off the Lordstown, Ohio, assembly line before General Motors quit producing the compact car, closed Lordstown and relocated those workers who wanted to move to other factories.
"I'm very excited but also very somber," Frazier said in a late August interview in a conference room at the Ren. "Yesterday I spent a few hours on the phone with the secretary of Local 1112. They moved everybody as of yesterday. So, you know, it's sad, but at the same time I'm really proud because I know that I'm honoring really dignified, incredible working people."
To say that Frazier gets close to her work, and to the people in it, is an understatement. She describes a spring spent teaching three days at SAIC, then spending the next four, hour after hour, week after week, in and around Lordstown.
"The last Cruze came off on March 6th," she said. "The last gathering of the United Auto Workers was March 8th. After that, media ceased. No one was coming. And so here's where my practice is the most significant. What I'm doing in my work is asking the question, What does it look like when the media is gone and it's no longer headline news? What does it look like to see a worker idle, their life idle, not just the plant? That's the most important part of this whole story."
And it's not a story that ends, in Frazier's mind. "These aren't projects, right? This is my mission, my purpose, my life's work. And once I'm involved in someone's life photographically, these are relationships that go on forever. You keep going back. I keep going back."
Kasey King was the editor and photographer for the UAW Local 1112 newspaper, and she and Frazier became "photo buddies," said the artist, who also interviews and often includes quotes from the people she's shooting alongside their images.
King, who has now relocated to work for GM in Bowling Green, Kentucky, came away impressed by Frazier's dedication to the task. "You don't ever see her sidetracked with something else," said King. "She is focused on just getting your story and hearing it and really comprehending it. .... She's not just doing a sound bite or doing a quick story and moving on."
Frazier grew up in Braddock "next to Andrew Carnegie's steel mill," she said, in a town hard hit by industrial decline, racism and classism. Painting and drawing and possibly becoming a graphic designer changed in college, at Edinboro University in northwest Pennsylvania, thanks to an inspirational professor, Kathe Kowalski, who taught her that "social commentary through visual art was a possible life to have."
She learned to revere the work of Gordon Parks and other great photographers, to want to emulate Parks' practice wherein, she said, "the camera became a weapon."
Even before coming under Kowalski's wing, in her first photography class at the school, "we had a portrait assignment, and I remember I did a portrait of my cousin on the side of our house, and I put it up in class and (the professor) just said, "Look, you've raised the bar here in terms of portraiture, and I really think you should reconsider your major.' "
Her widely acclaimed first book, 2014's "The Notion of Family," showcases a long-running series of family photographs in Braddock that aim to make that tightly focused story a universal one of government and corporate abandonment.
"The whole Braddock project with especially the more autobiographical part was the thing that really got our attention first," said Michael Darling, chief curator of the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago, which has Frazier photos in its collection. "And I suppose that's where most of the art world kind of found out about her. It was that mix of making a social commentary about this economic problem, societal problem, but then also her interweaving her own personal story into it that felt really just so authentic and relatable and powerful."
Frazier went on to earn a masters in fine art photography at Syracuse University, then held academic and curatorial jobs at Yale and Rutgers before the SAIC opportunity came. "I knew since I was a little girl that I was going to live in Chicago one day. I knew it," she said.
She feels the Rust Belt connection between Pittsburgh and Chicago, she said, and a special affinity for the work of Studs Terkel, the Chicago oral historian similarly focused on advocating for working class people by documenting their lives.
"She is someone who both takes amazing photographs and has this really large, overarching vision," said Karsten Lund of the Renaissance Society, who co-curated the Frazier show. "I think it's really exceptional to find someone who's working at all those different levels."
But the more time you spend talking to Frazier, the more clear it becomes that this is something beyond work.
"I've made a commitment, right?" she said. "My life isn't my own. My work is in service to making sure that working class people in this country are seen and heard. I think that their lives are much more valuable and precious than CEOs' and politicians'. And it's about time that kind of power dynamic changes."

Texto completo: Today, I decided to try a recipe for "really the best gazpacho ever" shared a while ago by a reader.
My reason for trying it today was that I harvested a basket of ripe tomatoes with spots or cracks and had to do something with them, and quick.
So I cut bad parts off and plugged in my blender. I blended the tomatoes with red onion, cucumber, a Hungarian pepper from my garden, a bit of sherry vinegar, garlic, salt and a decent amount of olive oil. The recipe called for straining afterwards, but you know what? I had a big bowl of it straight from the blender, sans straining. Addictively good.
You could do either, leave as is or strain for an elegant presentation.
Now truth be told, I have a packed file of gazpacho recipes. This one, though, is my newest fave. A smooth Spanish style gazpacho, easy and so fast.
The bonus? It uses those late summer, less than perfect, dead ripe veggies.
Make this gazpacho! Let me know how you like it, OK?
Originally from Julia Moskin, New York Times. Here's my adaptation. As always, go to taste.
Ingredients
A good 2 pounds red or combo of ripe tomatoes, cored and chunked up — I used red, yellow, and grape
1 Cubanelle or sweet banana pepper or about half of a sweet bell, seeded and chunked. I used a sweet Hungarian banana pepper
1 cucumber, about 8" long, peeled and chunked
1/3 to 1/2 cup red or mild onion, chunked (careful, here, you can always add more but you can't take away...).
1 nice teaspoon garlic/1 large clove
1 tablespoon sherry vinegar
Salt — I used 11/2 teaspoons
1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil or to taste, plus extra to drizzle
Instructions
Put everything but vinegar, salt and oil in blender and blend on high until very smooth. With motor running, add vinegar and salt.
Slowly pour in oil and blend until everything is emulsified and again, smooth. It will be the thickness of salad dressing. If a bit watery, add a little more oil until it's creamy the way you like it.
Now you can either strain it all through strainer or food mill, making sure you press hard on solids, or leave as is, or just strain some of it.
For a silky smooth soup, you should strain it all.
Chill about 6 hours or overnight.
To serve:
Adjust seasonings. If too thick, add a bit of ice water.
Serve with drizzle of oil.
Serve as appetizer or first course in shot or small glasses or as an entre in a bowl.
Try my garlic crostini alongside.
Substitute for sherry vinegar
Try red wine vinegar with maybe a tad of sugar, since sherry vinegar has a sweeter flavor profile.
Serve alongside the gazpacho.
Rub a clove of garlic on thick baguette slices. Drizzle with olive oil.
Sprinkle with shredded Manchego, Parmesan, or leave plain.
Run under broiler.

Iowa business leaders urge approval of USMCA

Texto completo: Facing a drawn-out deadlock and unwavering tariffs, Iowa business leaders asked their congressional delegation this week to adopt the United States-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement.
"The trade deal is essential to Iowa farmers, businesses, and families and provides economic predictability that Iowa needs for the future," wrote the authors of the letter, signed by 79 representatives of the state's companies, business organizations and local governments.
The Iowa Farm Bureau Federation, the Association of Business and Industry and the Greater Des Moines Partnership organized the letter and publicly released it Monday morning. The signers represent Collins Aerospace, Corteva Agriscience, Fareway Stores Inc., MercyOne, Tyson Foods and Vermeer Corp., among others.
Canada bought $4.2 billion worth of goods from Iowa in 2018, more than any other country. Mexico ranked second, with $2.3 billion worth of Iowa's exports, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. (Overall, Iowa ranked 24th in the country in exports to the North American countries last year.)
Compared to the previous North American Free Trade Agreement, ratified in 1993, the Iowa business group celebrated what they believe are a couple of improvements in the new agreement. They are pleased by a chapter that addresses digital trade among the countries, as well as a provision that allows the countries to share data across borders.
Many business groups across the country have pressured Congress to pass the agreement, which has been stuck for almost a year. On the same day that the Iowa businesses sent their message, according to Reuters, 11 national trade groups signed their own letter to Congress, also urging the lawmakers to adopt the USMCA.
Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley supports the agreement. But he has also sharply criticized President Donald Trump's approach, arguing current tariffs on Canada and Mexico have delayed the deal.
The president placed a 25% tariff on steel imports from both countries, as well as a 10% tariff on aluminum.
"If these tariffs aren't lifted," Grassley wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed on April 28, "USMCA is dead. There is no appetite in Congress to debate USMCA with these tariffs in place."
Trump lifted the tariffs on Canada and Mexico, and a spokesman for Grassley said Tuesday afternoon that the senator's focus is on bringing Democrats to the table.
Republican U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst and U.S. Rep. Steve King have both supported the agreement. Democratic U.S. Reps. Cindy Axne and Abby Finkenauer have each said over the past two weeks that they are optimisticabout the deal, but they worry its current form will hike up drug prices.
Their statement echos criticism from Democratic leadership, which has targeted a USMCA provision that lets drug companies in all three countries block competition for a decade. On an advanced class of drugs known as biologics, generic companies will not be able to use data from the manufacturer for 10 years. This gives the original maker a decade to sell the product without competition.
The deal will not affect pharmaceutical businesses in the United States, where the current intellectual property protection lasts 12 years. But in Canada, the protection currently lasts eight years. In Mexico, the protection "practically" does not exist, according to the New York Times.
Democrats have also argued the deal does not enforce new labor union protections enough. The agreement would allow Mexican workers to hold secret ballot elections to determine whether they want to unionize and collectively bargain with their employers. But some Democrats and U.S. labor officials, including those in Iowa, have argued the deal does not provide a way to hold companies accountable if they don't honor the workers' rights.
"Negotiators need to go back to the table and hammer out an agreement that is good for working people," South Central Iowa Federation of Labor President Mark Cooper wrote in a letter to the editors July 9.

Details Aired Of Saudi Trial In the Murder Of Khashoggi

Texto completo: ISTANBUL -- In a courtroom in Saudi Arabia, the trial of the men accused of killing the journalist Jamal Khashoggi has been playing out under a cloak of secrecy, invisible to the world since it began in January -- unless you happen to be a Sabah reader.
On Sunday, Sabah, a Turkish newspaper, released tidbits from the trial that no one else has, naming the five men who face execution if found guilty and giving details about their testimony. That kept the story alive, even if it did not greatly advance what was already known.
In the three days since, the newspaper has released further details, including new excerpts it says are from the transcripts of audiotapes recorded inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul where Mr. Khashoggi was killed and dismembered.
The Saudis, their reputation battered by the case, have kept the trial closed to the public. That is the usual practice in Saudi Arabia, but in this case many also see an attempt to prevent further scrutiny -- and skepticism -- once official conclusions are reached.
As the first anniversary of the journalist's death approaches, Turkey has sought to return the assassination to the forefront. Its president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, is expected to repeat demands for an international investigation when he appears before the United Nations General Assembly. Mr. Erdogan appears determined to maintain pressure on Saudi Arabia and to keep the moral high ground over a regional rival.
Sabah is well known as being close to Mr. Erdogan, and as his government's favorite conduit for leaks. It has frequently published explosive new details about the Khashoggi case and, later, a book, often to heated denials from the Saudis.
Much of the information has been confirmed by Western officials to The New York Times and other media outlets, and was included in a report on the killing by Agnes Callamard, the United Nations expert on extrajudicial killings, who called for an international investigation into Saudi officials' role in the murder.
Mr. Khashoggi, 59, entered the Saudi Consulate last Oct. 2 to obtain papers that would allow him to marry. He was killed, Saudi officials later said, by a group of Saudi officials after a scuffle.
Turkish officials insist that the group arrived with the intent to kill Mr. Khashoggi. Saudi officials claim a plan to make him return to Saudi Arabia went wrong.
His body has never been found.
Sabah's latest series of articles appears aimed at undercutting testimony from the trial that seemed to exonerate senior officials close to the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, and lay blame solely on the men who carried out the killing.
In particular, Sabah questioned the reported testimony of one of the most senior Saudi officials on trial, Maj. Gen. Ahmed al-Assiri, a high-ranking adviser to the crown prince. General al-Assiri, the newspaper reported, testified that he had asked the leader of the operation to persuade Mr. Khashoggi to return to Saudi Arabia.
"Asiri's testimony is aimed at hiding Prince Salman's responsibility in the events," the newspaper wrote, using a different spelling of his name.
The testimony of other officials at the trial indicated that the killing was premeditated, the newspaper said.
It said a Maj. Gen. Mansour Abu Hussein had admitted that he was the overall man in charge of the operation and confessed in his testimony that he had been authorized by General al-Assiri to use force if necessary to bring Mr. Khashoggi back. He also said he had arranged for the operations team to meet Saud el-Qahtani, the crown prince's powerful social media czar, before their departure, it said.
The newspaper did not say how it came by its information about the trial. The first hearing, which took place Jan. 3, was attended by diplomats from the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council -- the United States, Britain, France, Russia and China -- but no other outside observers or journalists, it said.
Another Saudi security official, Maher Abdulaziz Mutreb, testified that Mr. Khashoggi had been killed by a lethal injection, the newspaper reported.
On Monday the newspaper published details of conversations of Saudi officials before and during the killing, and said they reinforced claims that the murder had been planned. The excerpts were from transcripts of audiotapes widely reported before to have been compiled from listening devices inside the consulate.
Turkish officials could not be reached to confirm or deny the details published by Sabah.

Texto completo: Justify failed a drug test one month before the 2018 Kentucky Derby, and the California Horse Racing Board decided to dismiss the case after the colt went on to win the Triple Crown, The New York Times reported Wednesday.
Justify tested positive for scopolamine after winning the Santa Anita Derby in April '18, and qualifying for the Kentucky Derby in the process.
Scopolamine is a banned substance that can enhance performance. Such a result should have resulted in a disqualification, purse forfeiture and the removal of his Kentucky Derby entry. Instead, California regulators waited until April 26, nine days before the Kentucky Derby, to inform Bob Baffert, Justify's Hall of Fame trainer.
Baffert had a second sample tested by an independent lab, and it confirmed the results three days after Justify won the Kentucky Derby.
The board decided that the test results could have come from contaminated food. However, the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission's former drug lab chief, Rick Sams, said the amount of scopolamine in Justify's system suggested it "has to come from intentional intervention."
Two months after dismissing the Justify case, the California board changed the penalty for a failed scopolamine test from a DQ to a fine and a possible suspension
Basketball: The U.S. was ousted from medal contention by France at the World Cup, failing to capture gold at a major tournament for the first time since the 2006 world championships. Rudy Gobert had 21 points and 16 rebounds and France beat the U.S. 89-79 in the World Cup quarterfinals in Dongguan, China. The U.S. had won 58 consecutive tournament games in FIBA and Olympic competition. It was bidding to become the first nation to win three consecutive World Cups. The U.S. already had qualified for next summer's Olympics in Tokyo.
College football: Tennessee sophomore CB Bryce Thompson was reinstated and will be allowed to practice. Thompson had been suspended indefinitely after an Aug. 24 arrest on a misdemeanor domestic assault charge.
Golf: Rory McIlroy was voted PGA Tour player of the year after posting the most top-10 finishes and winning the FedEx Cup. It's the third time McIlroy has won the Jack Nicklaus Award.
NHL: The Bruins signed coach Bruce Cassidy, 54, to a multiyear contract extension. Terms of the deal weren't available.

Kamala Harris’ criminal justice reform plan can’t be trusted

Texto completo: “I know the system from the inside out, so trust me when I say we have a problem with mass incarceration in America. Trust me when I say we have a problem with accountability. Trust me when I say we have to take the profit out of criminal justice.” These are the words of presidential candidate Kamala Harris in an interview with the New York Times on her recently-unveiled criminal justice plan. She asks voters to put their faith in her because of her experience, but it’s her experience that shows voters exactly why they should think twice about that.
Harris’s new plan begins with an introduction that attempts once more to paint the self-portrait she’s persistently pushed throughout her campaign: one of a reform-minded prosecutor who “has seen firsthand the fundamental flaws of the system.” She’s seen them alright—and personally contributed to them. As Tulsi Gabbard aptly noted in the last debate, Harris was far from a reformer during her prosecutor days. In fact, she was notoriously tough on crime.
But she’s apparently had a pretty recent change of heart.
In her new plan, Harris proposes ending the war on drugs, claiming marijuana legalization is the first step toward that. It’s an excellent proposition and fairly mainstream among the Democratic candidates, but it’s certainly not something that Harris has always stood by.
Historically, she opposed the legalization of marijuana, and as a San Francisco District Attorney, she oversaw hundreds of marijuana convictions. Although she may not have been directly involved in the convictions, she had immense power to direct her attorneys which marijuana cases to prosecute, and what punishments to pursue. Yet, despite how sorry she is for all of the lives she’s had a part in ruining during her tenure as lead prosecutor, she’s done nothing to help those particular people.
Among her plans, too, we find a proposed effort to expunge marijuana-related criminal records and create a grant program from marijuana sales tax to help those most adversely affected by the drug war. Sure, these policies are noble, but they’re not a total ceasefire in the drug war by any means. After all, this is where Harris’s plan here falls flat. Aside from legalizing marijuana, she supports reducing the sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine. That’s a change that is certainly important, but, in terms of drug reform, it’s low-hanging fruit.
Proposing pre- arrest diversion programs, legalizing safe injection sites, descheduling drugs and loosening academic study restrictions are all strong policies that would help end the drug war. But she didn’t make any of those suggestions.
As a San Francisco District Attorney, Harris opposed the use of drug courts for those charged with drug related crimes—another action which is not cohesive with ending the drug war which she now supports. Drug courts are great, because they’re set up to provide an alternative sentencing route for individuals so they can be connected with the resources and treatment they need, rather than sticking them straight into prison.
But as Reason Magazine reports, Harris complained that people “learned how to manipulate the system by simply claiming to be addicts.” She proposed barring individuals from drug court if they had ever sold any quantity of drugs in the past—even if they needed addiction help. This means prison time for low-level drug offenders who, somehow, she’s had a wild change of mind about.
That same goes for her stance of the cash bail system. Money bail disproportionately harms low- income individuals, because they can’t afford to buy their way out of pretrial incarceration the way the wealthy can. They remain in jail—sometimes for months on end—until they can find a way to post bail or until their court date comes around.
Though Harris has sponsored legislation to end cash bail, this fight may dwindle when she becomes president. She previously supported hiking the rates of cash bail, but, of course, this is the exact opposite of what she’s saying now.
Sure, Harris’s criminal justice plan has a lot of good proposals. It even calls for accountability by granting the U.S. Department of Justice explicit authority to conduct investigations into prosecutorial offices that commit misconduct.
It’s a bold policy that stands among many other needed reforms outlined found in her plan. But none of this changes the fact that she spent so many years of her life locking people up for the things she’s claiming to be dovish on now. And that’s when she wasn’t trying to become president.
Harris has been caught lying for political gain before, so what’s stopping her from doing it again—especially if it could win her the Oval Office?
For the sake of those who spent years of their lives sitting in prisons because of her terrible policies, it’s a question worth seriously considering.

Frank Bruni: We will never, ever be rid of Donald Trump

Texto completo: House Democrats are inching closer to a formal impeachment inquiry, as if that’s how best to exorcise Donald Trump from the body politic. Mark Sanford just became the third Republican to announce a 2020 primary challenge and to dream of a successful insurrection against an emperor whom most of the party meekly obeys.
And 10 Democrats will take the stage on Thursday night for the party’ next presidential debate, each determined to present himself or herself as the surest route to the far side of Trump.
So now is as good a time as any to state what should be obvious to anyone who has considered Trump’s psychology, registered his megalomania and taken full account of his behavior to date.
We will never, ever be rid of him.
Oh, sure, we may remove him from the presidency , which is no small thing. But that won’t get him out of the nation’s bloodstream. It sure as hell won’t shut him up. If you think he has demolished all the norms of what it means to be the president of the United States, just wait until you see the sledgehammer he takes to the traditional role and restraint of former presidents.
He won’t be at an easel in remote Texas, like George W. Bush. He won’t be biting his tongue and taking big, deep, centering breaths, like Barack Obama.
A foundation devoted to good works? Been there, done that, and it was a perfect mirror of the man, which is to stay a complete sham. It’s under investigation by the state of New York.
No, he’ll be tweeting, bleating, ranting and raging in precisely the manner that he is now, just without the nuclear codes. And if that transition happens after November 2020, he’ll declare the election suspect, fraudulent, the result of a media crusade against him, the fruit of illegal votes. He pressed that narrative in 2016 even though he was declared the victor. A winner that sore is poised to be an epically nasty loser, and I have an easier time imagining a “Thelma and Louise” remake starring Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin than I do the Trumps graciously beckoning the Warrens across the threshold of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
The post-Trump landscape — or, rather, the impossibility of one — is on my mind in part because of a prediction by Brad Parscale, the manager of the Trump 2020 campaign, at a California Republican convention last weekend. “The Trumps will be a dynasty that will last for decades, propelling the Republican Party into a new party,” he said in a speech to delegates.
Then The Atlantic published a riveting cover story by McKay Coppins that in some ways raised the same prospect, reporting that Ivanka and Don Jr. are jockeying to be their dad’s rightful political heir and noting that the Trump progeny are genetically wired to wring every last droplet from their father’s celebrity that they can.
Flashing back to the night in November 2016 when the family watched the election returns, Coppins wrote that they were in shock, because Trump “was supposed to go down in a spectacular blaze of made-for-TV martyrdom that all of them could capitalize on. Ivanka had a book coming out. Don and Eric were working on a line of patriotically themed budget hotels. And preliminary talks were underway to launch a Trump-branded TV network that would turn disgruntled voters into viewers. Now they needed a new plan.” Apparently it’s one modeled after the Kennedys and the Bushes, only with a much bigger budget for hair and makeup.
Best of luck, Trumpkins. I just don’t see it. Ivanka — or, as I like to think of her, Our Lady of the DMZ — has shown a shocking tone-deafness during her White House romp. And Don Jr. was the nitwit emailing ecstatically and then lying badly about that June 2016 meeting with the Russian, um, adoption evangelists. These two have all of Dad’s gall but only a scintilla of his guile.
Trump won’t hang around by proxy, in a next generation of opportunists with his surname or agenda. That would negate the whole point of his pivot into politics. It wasn’t to promote ideas; it was to promote himself . Health permitting, he’ll move heaven and earth to maintain his omnipresence in American life, by which I mean he’ll be as outrageous as he must to stay in the news. And we in the media will confront a decision: Give him what he wants, or let go of him and all the eyeballs he draws?
Even if we let go, there’s the strong possibility, as Coppins noted, that he’ll establish his own media enterprise, with a network where the news really is fake, adulation doesn’t hinge on nuisances like the ballot box and Sean Hannity isn’t the model for Trump veneration. He’s the baseline.
From that coddled perch Trump can take out his big black Sharpie and write higher vote counts over his actual, official ones. He can draw horns on John Bolton and a halo over William Barr. He can sketch a second White House adjacent to the first one but taller, with gold trim.
That’s where he’ll be living, his power fictive but his presence ineluctable, snappily ever after.

Brown accused of rape; Suit by former trainer claims assaults in 2017 &amp; 2018

Texto completo: A lawsuit filed Tuesday accuses Patriots wide receiver Antonio Brown of raping a woman in 2017 and 2018.
The woman, Britney Taylor, said in a statement that "as a rape victim of Antonio Brown, deciding to speak out has been an incredibly difficult decision... Speaking out removes the shame that I have felt for the past year and places it on the person responsible for my rape. I will cooperate with the NFL and any other agencies; however, at this time, I respectfully request that the media please respect my privacy."
Brown's lawyer, Darren Heitner, said in a statement that "Mr. Brown denies each and every allegation in the lawsuit."
Brown, a seven-time Pro Bowler, was cut by the Raiders and signed by the Patriots on Saturday after what was already one of the most tumultuous offseasons ever.
The Patriots and NFL have yet to comment publicly on the accusations. ESPN reports that Brown "intends to countersue" for extortion, although he had not actually filed any suit as of Tuesday night.
The New York Times first reported the existence of Taylor's lawsuit. She was a Central Michigan classmate and former trainer of Brown's. According to the lawsuit, the two met at Central Michigan in 2010 as Bible study partners, but reconnected in 2017 when Brown asked her for "help improving flexibility" that Taylor could provide with her gymnastics background.
The civil complaint, filed in the Southern District of Florida on Tuesday, says that Brown "exploited, sexually assaulted, and raped his former trainer Britney Taylor." It details three incidents, two in June 2017 and one in May 2018. The first says that Brown "grabbed and kissed her without her consent" while his penis was exposed.
The second account, describing events less than a month later, says that Brown hid behind Taylor, masturbated, and ejaculated on her back, later bragging about it in text messages. According to the lawsuit, Brown was surreptitiously masturbating behind Taylor while she was watching video of a church service. The complaint contains screenshots of Brown saying "I jack my d-k on your back!" in what appears to be an email or direct message.
In April 2018, Taylor began working with Brown again on the condition that he "stop flirting with her anymore." That work, according to the lawsuit, grew to include "booking flights for him, keeping his travel schedule, making sure he arrived at sponsored events on time and even babysitting his children."
On May 20, 2018, according to the complaint, Brown "forced her down onto a bed, pushed her face into the mattress, and forcibly raped her."
Brown's lawyer describes the encounter as consensual sex.
Brown, who was traded from Pittsburgh to Oakland in March, suffered gruesome foot injuries in cryotherapy this summer, then fought the NFL over his preferred helmet, threatening to retire if he wasn't allowed to wear it. Last week, Brown was fined by Raiders GM Mike Mayock, called him a "cracker" at practice, requested his release, was released, and signed with the Patriots later that day.

Texto completo: The Trump administration Tuesday disputed reports of a Russian official who was recruited as a spy for the CIA and then evacuated to the United States after revealing information about the Kremlin's interference in the 2016 election.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, White House spokesman Hogan Gidley and the CIA challenged reports that appeared in The New York Times, CNN and elsewhere about a Russian official with high-level access who provided the U.S. with valuable intelligence for years until he was abruptly pulled from the country.
"Suffice it to say that the reporting there is factually wrong," Pompeo said Tuesday, without specifying what he was disputing. Pompeo was head of the CIA at the start of the Trump administration, soon after the spy reportedly was brought to the United States.
The CIA singled out CNN in a statement that disputed the network's reporting about what prompted the evacuation. CNN cited an unnamed source as telling them that the informant was removed in part because of concerns about the Trump administration's mishandling of classified information and the possibility that the Russian official could be exposed.
"CNN's narrative that the Central Intelligence Agency makes life-or-death decisions based on anything other than objective analysis and sound collection is simply false," said CIA Director of Public Affairs Brittany Bramell. "Misguided speculation that the president's handling of our nation's most sensitive intelligence, which he has access to each and every day, drove an alleged exfiltration operation is inaccurate."
Gidley also singled out the CNN report as "so wrong" and slammed an NBC report that purported to say where the spy lived.
"For the media, the hypocrisy they have is so egregious to come out and try and say that this president is putting lives in danger with the way he handles information, classified or not," he said on Fox News. "When they are the ones that actually go to this person's house with a video camera, revealing where this person lives, potentially their identity and that of their family."
The Times said the official was recruited decades ago, advanced through the ranks of the government and eventually held an influential position and was able to confirm that President Vladimir Putin ordered the campaign to influence the U.S. political campaign to favor Trump.
The paper said the official was one of the CIA's "most important -- and highly protected -- assets" until the end of the Obama administration when the Americans began to worry about his safety because news media coverage of the election interference risked exposing him to the Kremlin.
It said the informant at first refused to be extracted, citing family concerns, which prompted fear at the CIA about whether the person was trustworthy. But months later, after more media coverage, he agreed and was taken to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was dismissive of the reports and the influence of an official he identified by name. He said the person was fired several years ago and did not have a high-ranking position in the Russian government.
U.S. media reports to the contrary, he told reporters, are "pulp fiction."

TRUMP'S FOREIGN POLICY IS A FAILURE THE PRESIDENT'S ADMINISTRATION HAS NOT SOLVED A SINGLE SIGNIFICANT INTERNATIONAL ISSUE

Texto completo: It was probably only a matter of time until President Donald J. Trump's approach to international diplomacy - "I'm in charge; the purpose of foreign relations is to make me look good; and I will continue to pay close, early-morning attention to television and not restrain myself from making policy by tweets no matter how superficial the medium" - would blow up something important.
That time has finally arrived.
Former American ambassador to Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad, who speaks the language, has been negotiating with the Taliban in Qatar for a year now. The talks reached a point where Mr, Khalilzad and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo felt they could invite Taliban representatives to Camp David in Maryland, presumably to sign something.
But then a Taliban bomb killed an American soldier, the fifth this year, in Afghanistan. Mr. Trump scrubbed the Camp David talks, which he announced via Twitter. It is well within his powers to make this decision, although the purpose of meeting with the Taliban and signing an accord would be exactly to end such killing.
It is also important to remember that the Taliban is not a highly centralized, tightly organized body. It is, in fact, composed of many, somewhat independent elements.
A normal reaction to such an attack would be for Mr. Khalilzad to go back to the Taliban and ask what they thought they were doing with the attack, Instead, Mr. Trump ended the talks that aimed to bring an end to the war in Afghanistan, a conflict that has claimed thousands of American lives, cost an estimated $2 trillion and has now lasted nearly 18 years.
One curious aspect of the latest Taliban episode is the focus it put on the location of the possible meeting, perhaps reflecting our hotelier-president's mindset. He recently proposed that the next G-7 meeting, which the United States is scheduled to host, be held at his Trump National Doral Miami resort, meaning a lot of money for the Trump Organization. Perhaps he would not have called off the Taliban meeting if it had been scheduled for Mar-a-Lago instead of Camp David.
Americans may now be looking at the dog days of any foreign policy aspirations that Mr. Trump and his merry band may have had in mind. This is normal as an American administration draws to an end. No administration can write checks that its successor may have to cover, and all parties to possible agreements are aware of this fact. The Trump administration's record of withdrawing from agreements, notably the Paris Agreement on climate change and the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade accord, is a perfect illustration of the complicated reality of doing business with the United States.
The Iran nuclear agreement, which had Iran basically trading its nuclear weapons development program for relief from economic sanctions imposed by the United States, is falling apart in spite of the efforts of the deal's European and Asian partners to save it.
Mr. Trump could resuscitate this useful accord by having the United States ease up on some of the sanctions to show good faith. The sanctions are calibrated in such a way to make that possible. Movement on that issue should also serve to reduce tensions and the possibility of wider warfare between the Sunni states and Shiite states in the Middle East, or at least to get the United States more clearly out of that conflict.
Meanwhile, Mr. Trump's envoy to develop a peace plan for the Israelis and Palestinians has quit. Relations with Russia are so politicized that little, if any, room for movement remains. And how has Mr. Trump managed to turn relations with Canada and Mexico into a drama?
When it comes to foreign affairs, it is definitely time to turn the page. Someone else should get a turn at trying to roll that fascinating but ungrateful rock up the hill.

Ex-Fox News Host's Business Is Under F.B.I. Investigation

Texto completo: A former Fox News host whose real estate advisory business left behind a trail of angry customers is under investigation by two states and the F.B.I.
Federal agents have begun talking to several customers and associates of the former "Fox and Friends Weekend" host, Clayton Morris, and a onetime business partner, according to four people familiar with the matter. Civil investigators working with the Indiana and New Jersey attorneys general have also been gathering information, the people said.
Representatives for the agencies declined to comment. It was unclear if the investigations would lead to any official action.
In March, The New York Times described how some of Mr. Morris's customers had claimed that he and his business partner, Bert Whalen, were selling run-down homes as investment properties and not making good on promises to renovate those homes. Mr. Morris and his company, Morris Invest, now face more than two dozen lawsuits in state and federal courts stemming from homes they sold in Indianapolis.
In one instance, Mr. Morris's firm sold a home to an investor in California just days after it burned down. The case was settled recently, according to a court filing. The terms were not disclosed.
David Hensel, a lawyer for Mr. Morris, declined to comment.
Mr. Morris left Fox News in 2017 to sell investment advice full time. His company offered to connect clients with turnkey investment homes in Indianapolis, Detroit and other cities, then oversee renovations and hire local managers to collect rent. But customers soon complained that Morris Invest was taking their money and leaving them with dilapidated properties after renovations they paid for upfront were poorly done or not done at all.
The investigation by the F.B.I. and federal prosecutors in Newark began early this year after complaints about Morris Invest and Mr. Morris's former business partner began to pile up with regulators in Indiana, in New Jersey and at the Federal Trade Commission. Its existence was only recently confirmed.
John Tompkins, a lawyer for Mr. Whalen, said his client "personally relates to the feelings and hardships of Clayton Morris's victims who may have lost thousands of dollars in the individual properties they invested in." He added that Mr. Morris had "also defrauded and deceived" his client.
Mr. Morris and his wife, Natali, moved their family to Portugal in July after selling their $ 1.4 million home in New Jersey. Ms. Morris, in a blog post explaining the family's move, said Mr. Whalen had taken advantage of her husband. She also blamed the news media for putting a "disproportionate amount of blame" on her husband.
Mr. Morris has continued to post his popular weekly podcast and offer a number of services, including selling investment homes and financial advice.

About wire services
Q: What wire services does LNP subscribe to and how do you decide what to use? Why don’t I see Fox News stories in print?
------------
We asked copy editor Bob Orr to answer.
A: We have several wire services we subscribe to: The Associated Press, the largest service in the United States; The New York Times News Service, which includes The Times and also provides content from Cox News Service; and Tribune News Service, which includes content from a wide range of newspapers across the U.S., including Chicago, Los Angeles, Baltimore, Detroit, Dallas and Miami and many in Pennsylvania.
When we examine stories from the wire services, the first thing we look for is content that would affect Lancaster County or has involvement by Lancaster County residents.
We look for stories that do not take an opinionated viewpoint, but deal with the facts in a straightforward way. You occasionally will see a story labeled “Analysis” on our news pages, which can get into some opinion. That label differentiates this type of story from a straight news story.
As for news stories from cable news networks, such as Fox News or MSNBC, you won’t see them here for several reasons. They don’t offer subscription services, but even if they did, we are not interested in publishing news stories that are largely opinion-driven and often far too partisan. We want to be as objective as possible.

Texto completo: A couple who overpowered security guards and escaped months after they were charged in the murder of an Arizona man have been added to the U.S. Marshals Service’s 15 Most Wanted list.
The service announced Monday that it had escalated its search for the couple, Blane and Susan Barksdale, who have been on the run for more than two weeks since they hijacked a prison transport van and disappeared.
“The couple’s alleged blatant disregard for human life and the law have made them both a priority for us,” Donald Washington, the director of the marshals service, said in a statement. “We believe this elevation and the public’s vigilance will ultimately result in their apprehension.”
The marshal for the District of Arizona, David Gonzales, said that Barksdale had “a history of involvement with white supremacy organizations,” and that there was evidence to suggest that the couple were getting help from such groups.
Blane Barksdale, 56, is white, 6-foot-5 and has tattoos of swastikas, warlocks and lightning bolts, “all associated with white supremacy groups,” the marshals service said. It described Susan Barksdale, 59, as “a 5-foot-7 white female.”
“I would stress to anybody that is assisting those individuals that we will come after them also,” Gonzales said.
The Tucson Police Department has charged the couple with first-degree murder, first-degree burglary, arson and other criminal offenses related to the death of Frank Bligh, 72, in April.
Authorities say that the couple, along with Blane Barksdale’s nephew, Brent Mallard, 31, set fire to Bligh’s Tucson home and caused an explosion. Bligh’s body has not been found, but the authorities believe he was killed.
The Barksdales absconded to Henrietta, New York, a suburb of Rochester, where they were found and arrested on May 24.
For three months, the couple were held in a jail in upstate New York. But on Aug. 26, as they were being transported more than 2,000 miles back to Arizona by a private security company contracted by the Pima County Sheriff’s Department in Arizona, the pair complained of “intestinal issues” and asked the guards to pull over, according to authorities. While the van was stopped in Blanding, Utah, the couple overpowered two security officers and shoved them into the back of the van with a third inmate, authorities said.
From there, the couple went to Vernon, Arizona, where an acquaintance gave them a red pickup truck, according to authorities. They abandoned the locked prison van, but the guards eventually broke free. The third prisoner in the transport van was returned to police custody.
Law enforcement officials said the Barksdales “may look friendly” but urged the public to consider them armed and dangerous, with access to a cache of more than 100 firearms.
Authorities have also increased the rewards for information that could lead to their arrests: up to $25,000 for Blane Barksdale, and up to $10,000 for Susan Barksdale.
Officials are also offering up to $5,000 for information leading to the discovery of the escape vehicle, a red 2004 GMC pickup truck with Arizona license plates 127-XTY.
Blane Barksdale’s former daughter-in-law, Kelly Westfall, spoke to KOLD News 13 in hopes that he would see her message.
“Own up to it,” she said. “Turn yourself in so your grandkids can see you. Otherwise, this could turn out bad.”

Texto completo: Political tribalism keeps getting worse. The demand for unthinking and uncompromising loyalty keeps getting louder. Individuals or institutions that try to maintain a sense of fairness and balance, that don’t want to choose sides in our Uncivil War, are branded as weak-kneed, fainthearted heretics. Two recent events highlight this dangerous development. First, Fox News was excoriated by President Donald Trump for daring to interview a Democratic Party official. And second, The New York Times was lambasted by liberal critics for a headline that was not, in their view, sufficiently critical of the president’s racist rants.
The parallels, of course, are imprecise. Trump has been eviscerating the press as a campaign strategy for years. But the similarities are still striking.
The president and his leftist critics share an instinct for intolerance: a deep disdain for anyone who strays from the party line, a demand for purity combined with a towering self-righteousness. You have to be on the Red Team or the Blue Team, a Loyalist or a Resister. Both sides fundamentally misunderstand the role of impartial and independent journalists. We belong to no tribe, root for no team. And if that sounds musty and old-fashioned, well, so does the Constitution, which not only protects a free press but defines it as essential to a healthy democracy.
Over on the left, the latest brouhaha was trigged by a Times headline over a story about a Trump speech that read, "Trump Urges Unity vs. Racism." The words were technically accurate, but not nuanced or skeptical enough, and Times editors acknowledged the problem and changed it after the first edition. But that was not nearly enough to quell the bombastic blowback.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted that the headline served as "a reminder of how white supremacy is aided by — and often relies upon — the cowardice of mainstream institutions."
Dan Pfeiffer, a senior adviser to President Obama, told Politico: "A vast swath of Democratic voters are pretty angry at the media. They see a racist liar in the White House, and a media too afraid to call him a racist or a liar."
At a meeting of New York Times staffers, one told editor Dean Baquet that the paper was "actively misleading" readers by being too soft on Trump. But Baquet, hit back. "Our readers and some of our staff cheer us when we take on Donald Trump, but they jeer at us when we take on Joe Biden," he told the staff meeting. "They sometimes want us to pretend that he was not elected president, but he was elected president. And our job is to figure out why, and how, and to hold the administration to account. If you’re independent, that’s what you do."
Baquet told CNN that there is a "generational divide" in the newsroom, and the meeting made clear there’s a racial one as well, with reporters of color among the loudest critics of their own bosses. But Baquet — the first African American editor of the Times — is determined to resist their pressure. "Our role is not to be the leader of the resistance," he insists.
We believe deeply in the traditions that Cavuto and Baquet are defending. No news organization is perfect, but at their best, they don’t work for the right or the left — for Trump or his rivals, for the Reds or the Blues. They are not Loyalists or Resisters.
They are simply journalists — fact-finders, truth-tellers — and more valuable than ever.

Texto completo: From her cramped seat in the middle of the Piper Cherokee six-seater plane, Georgia River Network Executive Director Rena Sticker pointed out the blond peat in the Okefenokee's glistening water below, the charred tree trunks from an epic fire and the expanse of wilderness uncluttered by buildings, roads or electrical lines.
Just about two miles east of the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge, the plane flew over a seam of higher ground called Trail Ridge where the Twin Pines Mineral LLC wants to mine for titanium and zircon. Georgia River Network isn't opposed to all mining, she said, but it is opposed to this mine.
"It's location, location, location," Stricker said ahead of flight with volunteer pilot Allen Nodorft of Southwings to survey the mining site. "It is right next to the Okefenokee, and Trail Ridge is part of the Okefenokee."
Twin Pines applied for a permit with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to move forward with the mining. The public comment period for permit ends Thursday.
More study requested
The Okefenokee, with 630 square miles of unique habitat, it is the largest wildlife refuge east of the Mississippi. Stricker and many of the refuge's 600,000 annual visitors consider it a national treasure. One that is defined by its water.
"Digging a big mine on Trail Ridge which holds water in the swamp, and digging that mine lower than the level of the swamp itself, will change the swamp hydrology such that the water from the swamp would go toward that big hole," she said. "When that happens then you're lowering the water table."
The Georgia Conservancy voiced similar concerns in its comments filed with the corps Aug. 29.
"One-third of the mining site drains to streams that discharge to the Okefenokee, one of Georgia's most precious ecological sites and an internationally-recognized treasure. The Okefenokee's 438,000-acre biodiverse ecosystem is home to the headwaters of two notable rivers, the Suwannee and the St. Marys, and contains nearly 353,981 acres of federally-designated wilderness. Stephen C. Foster State Park, located within the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge, was recently designated a Gold-tier International Dark Sky Park, wrote Savannah-based Charles McMillan III, the conservancy's natural resource director. "Trail Ridge plays a significant role in the hydrogeology of this area of Georgia; this saturated, low sand ridge acts as a sill for the eastern side of the vast Okefenokee Swamp."
He also noted that the mining site drains to the blackwater St. Marys River, home to several endangered species.
Twin Pines hydrogeologist Robert Holt, owner of Holt Hydrogeology and a professor at the University of Mississippi, said at the company's open house information session in St. George last month that the company has studied the hydrogeology of the area with 500 bore holes and 86 small diameter wells that monitor water levels. The data tells him the company can mine without harming the water flow in the Okefenokee.
Twin Pines plans to fill in the pit as it goes along, digging a trench that's 100 feet wide, 500 feet long and from 20 and 50 feet deep and advancing about 100 feet per day. It'll move lawnmower-fashion across the 1,268-acre big site.
"You're filling stuff back in; that allows the water levels behind it to recover," Holt said.
The mining won't connect the Okefenokee waters to those in the St. Marys River, he said, because the mining will maintain the natural divide that keeps the water on the west side of the ridge running toward the Okefenokee and that on the east side running east.
But the company's detailed hydrogeology data, including a three-dimensional computer model Holt is building, is not part of permit application. Both Georgia River Network and the Georgia Conservancy, among other groups, are asking the corps for a more thorough analysis of the possible effects than is currently planned.
"(T)he application still lacks essential information from the applicant," McMillan wrote to conclude the Conservancy's comment. "The Okefenokee Swamp is a unique ecosystem, and Trail Ridge is an integral element."
Separate from the corps' permit, Twin Pines is also applying for a water withdrawal permit from the Georgia EPD.
"Our springs are failing," said Jim Tatum, historian and board member for Our Sante Fe River, who accompanied Stricker on the aerial tour. "Our aquifer is dropping. We're headed the wrong way. We have to drop our water usage."
Previous proposal
and current mines
This isn't the first Okefenokee mining controversy. The DuPont Co. proposed mining on Trail Ridge in the late 1990s but backed off the idea after government and public outcry against it.
″You can study this, you can write all the documents in the world,″ then Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt told the New York Times, ″but they are not going to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that there will be no impact.″
DuPont eventually abandoned plans to mine titanium and in 2003 the company donated all 16,000 acres to The Conservation Fund, which in 2005 transferred nearly 7,000 acres to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as an addition to Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge.
Dupont's efforts are still fresh in the minds of many Okefenokee advocates.
"I know 20 years ago the Fish & Wildlife Service said that the impacts could be deep and permanent and unrecoverable and I don't know why that would have changed now," Stricker said. "I don't think the technology is so different and I think that the threat is so big that there are just some places you don't need to mine. You can mine titanium elsewhere. This is our Okefenokee and it's so close."
From the air, Stricker pointed out another mine already operating in the area. It's Southern Ionics Mission South site.
"To me the biggest difference is they're not on Trail Ridge and they're 10 miles away from the swamp," Stricker said. "And they're not digging down below the water level of the Satilla River."
Another difference is that Southern Ionics avoided wetlands, impacting only 20 acres of wetlands out of 501 acres identified on its site. By contrast, Twin Pines is proposing to mine 522 acres of wetlands in this first phase of mining.
"Southern Ionics has done really good job," Stricker said. "I'm not against mining; I'm just for protecting the Okefenokee."

How ESPN changed sports

Texto completo: ESPN was not quite 3 months old when the late Red Smith, a New York Times sports columnist as well known in his day as Tony Kornheiser or Michael Wilbon now, took stock.
Smith quoted an unidentified man, presumably himself, as saying it was "the ghastliest threat to the social fabric of America since the invention of the automobile."
ESPN marked the 40th anniversary of its launch Saturday and, while one might accuse Smith of exaggeration, he wasn't that far off.
There's no question ESPN has been a catalyst for widespread change.
What follows are but a few of the changes it factored into over its first four decades:
It rewrote schedules: ESPN encouraged schools and conference conferences to play games on non-traditional days and at unorthodox times with the promise of exposure and/or money. Midweek college football games? Basketball tipoffs at odd hours? ESPN needed programming and offered exposure.
It rewrote routines: Launched before the internet and mobile phones put scores, highlights and even faraway games at fans' fingertips, "SportsCenter" liberated fans from having to catch the sports segment on local newscasts or wait for the morning paper, whether they watched before bed or woke up to it in the morning.
Highlight hustle: ESPN upped the ante on highlight-worthy plays. Jocks now were trying to impress their peers around the country via "SportCenter," where home runs, spectacular dunks, touchdown bombs and long-distance shots were the coin of the realm.
Bowl madness: Wonder why there's a Bad Boy Mowers Gasparilla Bowl, an Academy Sports + Outdoors Texas Bowl Bowl, a Servpro First Responder Bowl or any number of second- and third-tier postseason college football games? ESPN owns and operates 14 bowl games, using them to fill schedule dead spots from mid-December to early January.
Round-the-clock TV: It's almost inconceivable today, but TV outlets used to shut down in the wee hours, then play the national anthem when they resumed programming before dawn. ESPN was on the front edge of channels, such as CNN (which launched in 1980), to offer content around the clock. In time, everyone would.
Bracketmania: One of two smart programming moves in ESPN's first year was to secure early-round NCAA men's basketball tournament games in the spring of 1980, exploiting the surge in tournament interest from the famous Magic Johnson-
Larry Bird championship matchup a
year earlier. It boosted the value of its investment in college basketball during the season, which gave rise to a largely unknown former coach who introduced the nation to new honorifics such as "diaper dandy," "glue guy" and "PTPer": Dick Vitale.
Procedural obsession: The other vein of gold it unearthed in early '80 was convincing NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle to allow it to cover the NFL draft, an event no one else had ever thought worth televising. Everyone knows what it has become, the cottage industry it has spawned and its role in sustaining year-round fan interest.
Local TV sportscasting: "SportsCenter" led local newscasts to be less concerned with reporting all the scores, which in turn shortened the segments. Also, it helped fuel a trend of sportscasters increasingly trying to infuse humor in their reports. The incomparable wit and interplay of "SportsCenter" co-hosts Keith Olbermann and Dan Patrick raised the bar after Chris Berman's punny nicknames piqued interest.
Yes, snowboarding is a sport: By launching the X Games, a high-profile platform for nontraditional sports such as skateboarding and snowboarding to fill another programming void and appeal to a broader audience demographic, ESPN helped legitimize those competitions en route to Olympics acknowledgement.
Your cable or satellite bill just kept growing: In cable's heyday, ESPN wrung the lucrative combination of advertising revenue and carriage fees from cable and satellite providers more effectively than anyone. It used the expense of rights fees and popularity of sports that came with them to siphon off more per-subscriber cash from service providers than anything else on cable, regardless of how many of those subscribers actually watch ESPN.
Diversity: ESPN has been out in front of its media peers in the diversity of its staff, integrating women and people of color into a business populated mostly by white males.
Arguments. (Or should that be ARGUMENTS?): You don't agree with this analysis of ESPN? What's your hottest take? Even as argument shows such as CNN's "Crossfire" were falling out of favor in news -- they've since rebounded -- ESPN was doubling down on the genre with shows such as "Around the Horn" and personalities such as Stephen A. Smith.

Getting past my need for the pills

Texto completo: There's a difference between being addicted to a prescription drug and being dependent on it.
"I'm dependent on caffeine, but I'm not addicted," said Keith Humphreys, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford University. "It's not like I'd ever steal to get more coffee."
The National Institute on Drug Abuse says addiction "is characterized by an inability to stop using a drug; failure to meet work, social or family obligations; and, sometimes (depending on the drug), tolerance and withdrawal."

Physical dependence, meanwhile, "can happen with the chronic use of many drugs -- including many prescription drugs, even if taken as instructed. Thus, physical dependence in and of itself does not constitute addiction, but it often accompanies addiction."
It's a fair point -- and an important one to many in the recovery community, as has been made plain to me. Some readers were particularly unhappy with the online title of last Friday's column: "Hi, I'm David. I'm a drug addict."
In retrospect, a more nuanced headline would have been better, rather than an eye-catching (albeit imprecise) riff on a line from countless movies.
I also failed to anticipate how strongly some people would feel about distinguishing between addiction and dependence when discussing withdrawal symptoms.
And I'll acknowledge that if what I'm going through is this difficult, I can't even imagine what it's like for someone trying to kick an addiction.
But a word of warning to those contemplating a change in their drug therapy: Withdrawal is withdrawal. It's not easy.
"Call it what you want -- addiction, dependence. What matters is that getting off the drug can be very difficult," said Aaron Kheriaty, director of the medical ethics program at UC Irvine's School of Medicine.
In my previous column, I noted that a number of prescription medications -- painkillers, antidepressants, anti-anxiety drugs, tranquilizers, stimulants -- can affect users' bodies so intensely that severe withdrawal symptoms are likely if you stop taking them.
These symptoms can include fatigue, nausea, sweating, mood swings and even suicidal tendencies.
I was prescribed antidepressants about a decade ago to help cope with insomnia related to my 2007 diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes. And they worked well.
Eventually, though, I decided I wanted to come off the drug.
In no way am I encouraging other people to stop taking their drugs, and certainly not without consulting a doctor. If a drug therapy works for you, if it's improved your quality of life, by all means stick with it.
If, on the other hand, you choose to make a change, be aware that there can be challenges ahead.
"Withdrawal symptoms are distressing and drive people to keep taking the medication in order to avoid the symptoms," said Joanna Starrels, an associate professor at Albert Einstein College of Medicine.
She singled out commonly prescribed tranquilizers such as Xanax and Ativan, which act on the central nervous system and are known collectively as benzodiazepines.
"Stopping benzodiazepines like Xanax too quickly is not just distressing, it is dangerous," Starrels said. "People can have seizures and even die from benzodiazepine withdrawal."
I'm into my third week of abstinence after spending more than a year and a half gradually reducing my antidepressant doses. It hasn't been easy. I've been cranky and irritable. I'm not sleeping well. I feel and hear a whooshing in my head, which I take as my pulse demanding its fix.
I decided to come off the drug after reading in the New York Times last year that antidepressants can be more habit-forming than many people realize, and can cause staggering, even debilitating, discomfort when the body is denied its daily dose.
The article noted that "nearly half who tried to quit could not do so because of these symptoms."
The wisest move, experts say, is to approach any move to come off prescription drugs by first consulting with a healthcare provider, someone who can prepare you for what's ahead and assist when things become difficult.
"Even if it's not severe, it can be extremely unpleasant," said Gail Saltz, a clinical associate professor of psychiatry at New York Presbyterian Hospital. "You'll do just about anything not to feel that way. Many people might just say, 'Forget this. I'm going back on the medication.' "
Lon Schneider, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at USC's Keck School of Medicine, said "patients need to be aware up front" about the journey they're embarking upon, both in terms of beginning use of a prescription drug and understanding the dependence that can follow.
"Your best bet for coming off these drugs is what's called a slow taper, a process that can last for months," he said. "You want to do it slowly and methodically."
That's how I did it. Working with the endocrinologist who treats my diabetes, I gradually reduced the size of my daily dose. And once we brought that down, we switched my intake from every day to every other day, and then to every two days.
And then I took the plunge and stopped completely.
The experts I spoke with said the funky feeling I'm now experiencing -- and I don't mean that in a cool, Bootsy Collins sort of way -- will fade, and I should be over the hump within a few more days. Thank God.
"Not everyone tapers at the same pace," said Chad Brummett, director of the Division of Pain Research at the University of Michigan Medical School. "It's a time-intensive process."
That's an important point. Everyone is different, and everyone's reaction to a prescription drug will be unique.
Again, let me emphasize: Prescription drugs are not inherently bad. If they're working for you, great. Don't make any changes.
As I wrote on Friday: "A painkiller or an antidepressant can be the difference between a functional life and a life of unrelenting despair ... I'm not saying what's right for anyone else."
Nor am I now. But for anyone considering a new path, here are some lessons from my own experience:
* Be patient. Going onto prescription meds is easy. Getting off them is not.
* Get help. This is a medical issue. Make sure you've got a healthcare professional at your side.
* Set reasonable goals. Allow your tapering process to be as lengthy as necessary to feel comfortable and in control.
* Stay strong. And remember you're not alone.
I found that being active helped distract from bad feelings such as grumpiness and moodiness. Going to the gym helped. So did dog walks.
Since the first column ran, a number of readers have recommended a variety of remedies to help cope with stress and sleep deprivation, from acupuncture and yoga to edible cannabis.
I plan to speak with my endo about this. I'm open to hearing other people's experiences in this regard.
"If you are on a medication that can be difficult to withdraw from, like benzodiazepines or opioids, I would prepare for a potentially difficult path," said Michael Barnett, an assistant professor of health policy and management at Harvard University. "It is OK to go very, very slowly."

Texto completo: Get ready, couch potatoes.
This fall’s TV season is more cross-your-fingers-and-hope-for-the-best than viewers would like — but the highs have a chance to soar.
Several anthologies, including Ryan Murphy’s Netflix debut, may be the standouts of the season. But the schedule, packed with big names, is also littered with flimsy plots. Still, the beauty of TV is the surprises, not the predictable successes.
We’re here to help, and have weeded through the lineup to help you figure out what’s worth your time. Here are the new shows you should watch, give a try and avoid.
WATCH
“Unbelievable” (premieres Sept. 13 on Netflix)
If it’s not too traumatizing to watch, and for some it may be, this could be a defining story of the #MeToo movement. “Unbelievable” is a miniseries based on the ProPublica article about a teen (Kaitlyn Dever) accused of lying about her rape and the two female detectives (Merritt Wever and Toni Collette) who believe her.
“A Little Late with Lilly Singh” (premieres Sept. 16 at 1:35 a.m. on NBC)
While the small screen is saturated with talks shows, Lilly Singh is doing something special. The Indian-Canadian YouTube star with almost 15 million subscribers will become the only woman to host a late-night talk show on one of the four major networks when she takes over for Carson Daly.
“Prodigal Son” (premieres Sept. 23 at 9 p.m. on Fox)
In 2019 alone, Michael Sheen has played, to delightful results, a lawyer inspired by Roy Cohn on “The Good Fight” and a literal angel on “Good Omens,” so the logical next step, of course, is a serial killer nicknamed The Surgeon. Everything about it is absurd: the serial killer’s son (Tom Payne) who hunts serial killers and the ex-wife (Bellamy Young) who drowns her past in pills. Not to mention a truly bizarre and remarkable cast of surrounding characters.
“The Politician” (premieres Sept. 27 on Netflix)
Ryan Murphy, the co-creator behind “Glee,” “American Horror Story” and much more, pulled out all the stops for his first show at Netflix, and that’s saying a lot. In true Murphy fashion, he’s compiled a who’s who of Hollywood stars — including Gwyneth Paltrow, Jessica Lange, Zoey Deutch, Lucy Boynton, Bette Midler, Judith Light, Dylan McDermott and January Jones — for a show about an entitled California high school student (Ben Platt) and his rise in politics. Murphy might be the busiest man on the West Coast these days, but he hasn’t gotten it wrong in a long time.
“Modern Love” (premieres Oct. 18 on Amazon Video)
Anthologies are having a wildly successful run, thanks in large part to the aforementioned Murphy, which brings us to “Modern Love,” based on the New York Times’ weekly column about, well, modern love. As is often the case with anthologies, the cast will carry it, and it’s made up of Tina Fey, Anne Hathaway, John Slattery, Brandon
Victor Dixon, Cristin Milioti, Andrew Scott, John Gallagher Jr. and pretty much everyone Murphy hasn’t already cast.
“The Mandalorian” (premieres Tuesday, Nov. 12 on Disney+)
Sure, we may be culturally obligated to support all “Star Wars” content but there’s no way Disney+ is launching an entire streaming service with a less-than-perfect series. Jon Favreau moves over from Marvel to write and produce the story of a Mandalorian gunfighter (Pedro Pascal) a few years before “Return of the Jedi.”
“The Morning Show” (premieres this fall on Apple TV+)
It may be a little inside baseball, but there’s an inherent interest in who decides what we see on TV during our morning Cheerios and how they decide it. Of course, it helps when Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon and Steve Carell are the ones breaking the news. Early trailers for the comedy-drama less-than-subtly hint at a #MeToo ousting for Carell, but it’s not quite clear if that’s just a jumping off point. Best-case scenario is that this is a less-pretentious version of “The Newsroom.”
“The Gilded Age” (premieres in 2019 on HBO)
We don’t even have a cast for “The Gilded Age” yet, let alone a trailer to go off of, but Julian Fellowes’ “Downton Abbey” follow-up, about 1885 New York and the racial, financial and gender gaps that come with that time and that place, is full of promise.
TRY
“Emergence” (premieres Sept. 24 at 10 p.m. on ABC)
Allison Tolman deserves better than the credit she gets for being such a great actress and she also probably deserves better than “Emergence,” about a Long Island police chief who takes in a child after an accident of which she has no recollection. Like “Manifest” last season, this’ll be all about how long the writers can drag out the mystery.
“Perfect Harmony” (premieres Sept. 26 at 8:30 p.m. on NBC)
The line between fun and cheesy is awfully thin and this Bradley Whitford/Anna Camp musical comedy series about a grumpy, Ivy League music professor and a small-town church choir could easily go either way. The songs will probably make or break it.
“Evil” (premieres Sept. 26 at 10 p.m. on CBS)
Robert and Michelle King are among the most underrated showrunners on TV (seriously, “The Good Wife” and “The Good Fight” are great, but please watch the canceled “BrainDead” too). Supernatural drama “Evil” revolves around a clinical psychologist (Katja Herbers), a priest-in-training (Mike Colter) and a contractor (Aasif Mandvi) investigating religious occurrences (miracles, demonic possessions) and could be fascinating. It also could just end up being a less fun version of “The X-Files.”
“Almost Family” (premieres Oct. 2 at 9 p.m. on Fox)
Even if you’re not a lawyer, you have to realize that using your own sperm at your fertility clinic crosses some ethical boundaries (it’s also probably super illegal). But Leon Bechley (Timothy Hutton) somehow either didn’t know or didn’t care and now his daughter (Brittany Snow) is stuck with almost 100 new siblings, including Roxy (Emily Osment) and Edie (Megalyn Echikunwoke) in this drama.
AVOID
“Bob Hearts Abishola” (premieres Sept. 23 at 8:30 p.m. on CBS)
It’s a little hard to believe that, in 2019, Chuck Lorre is putting out a sitcom based entirely on the premise that a mediocre middle-aged white man (Billy Gardell) could have a crush on an immigrant (Folake Olowofoyeku), but here we are. What about that exactly is funny? It’s almost certainly not worth finding out. And hey, while you’re here, please don’t put emojis in show titles, like the actual heart shape that’s officially used in the show’s title.
“Stumptown” (premieres Sept. 25 at 10 p.m. on ABC)
Honestly, truly, how many tough private investigator shows do we need? It’s like Mad Libs: (proper noun), a former (job title), moves to (city with a lot of rain) and becomes a private investigator so (he/she) can support (his/her) (family member). This time it’s Cobie Smulders, Marine veteran, Portland, brother. Been there, been bored by that.
“Carol’s Second Act” (premieres Sept. 26 at 9:30 p.m. on CBS)
Carol (Patricia Heaton) has fulfilled her duties as a wife and mother and now she gets to be a doctor like she always wanted because women can’t actually be a wife, mother and doctor at the same time. So now we’re left with a bunch of jokes about the aforementioned Carol being old and, well, that seems to be about it.
“Bless the Harts” (premieres Sept. 29 at 8:30 p.m. on Fox)
It’s yet another animated show about a family being poor and white. The cast is great — Kristen Wiig, Maya Rudolph, Jillian Bell and Ike Barinholtz are all lending their voices as series regulars and Mary Steenburgen is set to have a recurring role — but just go watch “King of the Hill” at this point.

To honor the 12 victims of the Borderline mass shooting, the ‘Healing Garden’ is coming soon in Thousand Oaks

Texto completo: The Kelleys were considering moving out of state before tragedy hit Thousand Oaks. What kept them here was the support they saw after the Borderline Bar & Grill mass shooting and the Woolsey fire.
“The support, immediate, massive and ongoing support,” said Mike Kelley on Monday. “This is home.”
“Home” is getting a “Healing Garden” at Conejo Creek North Park in Thousand Oaks to honor 12 innocent lives lost.
The Garden began its march toward completion Monday as crews began construction on the Thousand Oaks memorial, with a goal of finishing it by Nov. 7, the one-year anniversary of the Borderline mass shooting.
A skip loader moved dirt just south of an existing pond, home to turtles and koi. And soon, the sounds of loaders and crews will give way to a place of reflection.
The Healing Garden will be built at Conejo Creek North Park, the city’s most popular park.
It will honor:
* RON HELUS : The Ventura County Sheriff sergeant was shot running into the Borderline Bar to help.
* CODY COFFMAN : The 22-year-old had been meeting with recruiters and planned to enlist in the Army.
* JUSTIN MEEK: He worked as a promoter at Borderline Bar. The 23-year-old was a former student at Cal Lutheran.
* NOEL SPARKS: She was a Moorpark College student who liked horseback riding.
* ALAINA HOUSLEY: The 18-year-old was a Pepperdine University freshman who aimed to study law.
* TELEMACHUS ORFANOS: He had the misfortune of being at the Las Vegas mass shooting and the one in Thousand Oaks.
* SEAN ADLER: He was a security guard at the bar, but he has just opened his dream business: a coffeehouse.
* DANIEL MANRIQUE: He was an ex-Marine sergeant who dedicated his life to helping emotionally scarred veterans get back on their feet.
* BLAKE DINGMAN: This 21-year-old Newbury Park resident played high school baseball at Hillcrest Christian School in Thousand Oaks.
* JAKE DUNHAM: He always answers his phone, his father said, but it just keeps ringing.
* KRISTINA MORISETTE : She graduated from Simi Valley High School and reportedly worked as a cashier at the bar.
* MARKY MEZA JR .: He worked as a busboy and food runner at the bar and would have turned 21 in less than two weeks.
READ THEIR STORIES here
A group comprised of city and park officials, Ventura County sheriff’s officials and Cal Lutheran staff recommended building the memorial at the park by the one-year anniversary of the shooting.
Thousand Oaks Mayor Rob McCoy said officials were unwilling to let the building of a memorial languish for years, as it has for the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.
“We wanted to have that in place (in Thousand Oaks) because we’ll never forget that day,” McCoy told the Daily News in June, when the garden’s design was unveiled. “While it’s a place for the families to come, it’s a place for the entire city to come. Every resident, over 160,000 residents were affected.”
And so, officials are on a fast track to having it completed by that November anniversary date.
When it’s done, the “Borderline 12” will be represented by a fountain feature with 12 vertical jets in the center of a pond, according to the city’s plan.
The scene will symbolize the broader community. There will be a contemplation area, where a shoreline will include seating and landscaping. A large Oak will be planted bordering the garden area. A boulder will introduce visitors to the Healing Garden at its entryway.
There will be 12 large natural stone-slab benches along the plaza — granite to illustrate the strength of the community. A unique color will designate 248 pavers in a scene that will represent the number of survivors from that night. And at the site’s north end, the existing Lakeside Pavilion will offer space for community events and other gatherings.
On June 25, the city of Thousand Oaks approved a grant agreement with Conejo Recreation and Park District for $250,000 to provide funding for the construction.
Since November, Borderline has itself become a place of reflection.
Kelley touched one of twelve crosses at the makeshift memorial outside the closed club. It was there for Jake Dunham, one of the 12 victims and Kelley’s Newbury Park neighbor. Kelley and his wife watched Dunham grow up.
“He was a force,” Kelley said of the young man who rode motorcycles and worked on his truck with friends in the family garage.
“Watching his mother light his lantern (one of 12) and set it free was the single most emotional event I’ve ever seen in my life,” Kelley said.
The question is where will all the photos, bibles, cowboy boots, rocks, hearts and the ceramic “Love” and “Peace” sculpture end up after the formal memorial is built.
Since the Borderline massacre, 2019 has continued to be a year in which gun violence in the United States is taking a deadly toll.
According to Mass Shooting Tracker, which defines a mass shooting as an incident in which four or more people are shot (but not necessarily killed), there have been 352 such incidents in the United States this year.
And of those, according to the New York Times, which compiled MST’s and other data for a report, there were 38 shootings by the end of August in which three or more people were killed (the Department of Justice defines a mass killing as an episode in which three or more are killed). That number — 38 — includes the shooting in El Paso, Texas, on Aug. 3, in which 22 were killed.

Daily on Healthcare: Congress and Trump risk seeing bipartisan victories on healthcare cost bills slip out of reach this fall

BIPARTISAN VICTORIES ON HEALTHCARE COSTS RISK SLIPPING OUT OF REACH THIS FALL: Republicans, Democrats, and President Trump have a chance to pass legislation to lower healthcare costs, but risk squandering the opportunity because of the tight timeline this fall and organized opposition.
A bipartisan group of senators returning to Capitol Hill this week will resume work on bills they advanced at the committee level before the summer recess that would address the high cost of prescription drugs for seniors and curb massive unexpected medical bills patients get after they leave the hospital.
If the bills pass, they would provide members of Congress with evidence to present to voters ahead of the 2020 election that they were able to log bipartisan victories. Alternatively, it could be perilous for Democrats to appear to hand Trump a victory on issues he has promised to address — the White House has said that lowering healthcare costs is a priority.
"The time is certainly now for action — this is the window," a senior GOP congressional aide said in an email.
But Congress is likely to struggle to find time to pass the legislation in the fall, with just three weeks of work in September before another break.
House leaders want to vote on temporary spending bills in September, and Democrats are pressuring Republicans to pass gun-control measures after a string of mass shootings this summer. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer did not list high healthcare costs in a letter he sent to senators about the priorities for the chamber. He instead cited gun control and election security, among other issues.
On healthcare specifically, Democrats want to put pressure on Republicans for their efforts to overhaul Obamacare. The Trump administration has sided with state GOP officials in a lawsuit that threatens to invalidate the healthcare law, a stance that a senior House Democratic aide confirmed would be a "major focus" of criticism for the caucus.
Democrats also want to bring attention to actions the Trump administration has taken to allow states to provide plans that wouldn't cover all of the same rules as Obamacare, including requirements to cover pre-existing conditions.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has not pledged to bring the committee-passed bills lowering healthcare costs to the floor. And the long recess provided lengthy time for outside industry groups to lobby members of Congress to oppose the legislation. While the bills are intended to help patients, they do so through having medical groups take the financial hit instead.
Read more about where the bills stand.

FIVE DEAD FROM LUNG DISEASES ASSOCIATED WITH VAPING: Five deaths due to respiratory disease related to vaping have been reported in Indiana, Minnesota, California, Oregon, and Illinois in the past three weeks. State health officials and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are investigating a possible link to vaping nicotine, THC, or both, as many patients who share similar symptoms have also reported vape use. The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health said Friday that “vaping is a probable potential cause,” though officials haven’t confirmed a link between vaping and the 450 cases under investigation. Health officials have since warned people to stop using e-cigarettes.
Durbin tells Sharpless he can either ban e-cigarettes or resign: Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin told acting Food and Drug Administration Administrator Ned Sharpless Friday that if he does not “take decisive action within the next 10 days” to ban e-cigarettes nationwide then he should resign from his post at the FDA. “If you continue to refuse to do your job — which is to protect the public health — then it is time to allow someone else to take the helm,” Durbin said.
BUTTIGIEG USES THE BIBLE TO BOLSTER ANTI-ABORTION ARGUMENT: Presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg defended his position that life does not begin at conception with the argument that “there's a lot of parts of the Bible that talk about how life begins with breath.” Buttigieg, speaking on The Breakfast Club morning radio show Friday with host Lenard "Charlamagne tha God" McKelvey, also criticized the conservative stance on abortion, saying that, “Right now, they hold everybody in line with this one piece of doctrine about abortion.”
Buttigieg’s bother-in-law, a pastor, says the mayor is “weaponizing” Christian beliefs: Buttigieg’s evangelical brother-in-law, Pastor Rhyan Glezman, 34, said Buttigieg’s interpretation of scripture is “outrageous,” and said: "If we're going to say we're for all people and we love all people, but we don't value human life in the womb, that's being a hypocrite. You're hypocritical if you don't stand up for all life. So that's why I'm speaking out."
GLOBAL SUICIDES ARE UP DESPITE PREVENTION MEASURES: One person dies by suicide every 40 seconds, according to the World Health Organization. The suicide rate has increased in the five years since WHO introduced the annual global suicide data report. So far, only 38 countries have suicide prevention measures in place.

Texto completo: Today in History
Today is Monday, Sept. 9, the 252nd day of 2019. There are 113 days left in the year.
Today's Highlight in History:
On Sept. 9, 1971, prisoners seized control of the maximum-security Attica Correctional Facility near Buffalo, New York, beginning a siege that ended up claiming 43 lives.
On this date:
In 1776, the second Continental Congress made the term "United States" official, replacing "United Colonies."
In 1850, California became the 31st state of the union.
In 1942, during World War II, a Japanese plane launched from a submarine off the Oregon coast dropped a pair of incendiary bombs in a failed attempt at igniting a massive forest fire; it was the first aerial bombing of the U.S. mainland by a foreign power.
In 1943, Allied forces landed at Salerno and Taranto during World War II.
In 1948, the People's Democratic Republic of Korea (North Korea) was declared.
In 1956, Elvis Presley made the first of three appearances on "The Ed Sullivan Show."
In 1960, in the first regular-season American Football League game, the Denver Broncos defeated the Boston Patriots, 13-10.
In 1986, Frank Reed, director of a private school in Lebanon, was taken hostage; he was released 44 months later.
In 1991, boxer Mike Tyson was indicted in Indianapolis on a charge of raping Desiree Washington, a beauty pageant contestant. (Tyson was convicted and ended up serving three years of a six-year prison sentence.)
In 1997, Sinn Fein (shin fayn), the IRA's political ally, formally renounced violence as it took its place in talks on Northern Ireland's future. Actor Burgess Meredith died in Malibu, California, at age 89.
In 2005, Federal Emergency Management Agency Director Michael Brown, the principal target of harsh criticism of the Bush administration's response to Hurricane Katrina, was relieved of his onsite command.
In 2013, four days of vehicular gridlock began near the George Washington Bridge when two of three approach lanes from Fort Lee, New Jersey, were blocked off; the traffic jam was later blamed on loyalists to New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie over the refusal of Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich (SAHK'-oh-lich) to endorse Christie for re-election. (Christie denied any prior knowledge of the lane closures.)
Ten years ago: In a speech to a joint session of Congress, President Barack Obama summoned lawmakers to enact sweeping health care legislation, declaring the "time for bickering is over." (In an extraordinary breach of congressional decorum, Rep. Joe Wilson, R-S.C., shouted "You lie!" when the president said illegal immigrants would not benefit from his proposals; Wilson ended up apologizing.) British commandos in Afghanistan freed New York Times reporter Stephen Farrell from Taliban captors, but one commando and a Times translator were killed.
Five years ago: President Barack Obama met privately with congressional leaders at the White House to discuss his plan for taking action against Islamic State militants. Former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown glided to an easy win in the Republican primary for Senate in neighboring New Hampshire (he ended up losing in November to incumbent Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (jeen shuh-HEEN'). Apple unveiled its long-anticipated smartwatch as well as the next generation of its iPhone.
One year ago: CBS chief Les Moonves (MOON'-vehz) resigned, hours after six more women accused the veteran television executive of sexual misconduct. Miss New York, Nia Imani Franklin, won the Miss America title, becoming the first woman to win the crown without having to put on a swimsuit. On the NFL's opening Sunday, Dolphins teammates Kenny Stills and Albert Wilson were the only two players to kneel during the national anthem. Novak Djokovic (NOH'-vak JOH'-kuh-vich) won his 14th Grand Slam title, beating Juan Martin del Potro 6-3, 7-6 (4), 6-3 in the U.S. Open final.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The top two Democrats in Congress called on Sunday for President Trump to defy the National Rifle Association and get behind legislation, already passed by the House but blocked in the Senate, to expand background checks to nearly all gun buyers.
With gun control high on Congress's agenda as lawmakers return to Washington this week after their August recess, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, sent a joint letter to the president, telling him that his "urgent, personal intervention is needed to stem the endless massacres of our fellow Americans by gunfire" and that he had a "historic opportunity to save lives."
The letter, which Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Schumer intend to follow with a news conference on Monday, is part of what Democrats say will be an all-out push for gun safety legislation this fall. In it, they asked Mr. Trump to express his support for H.R. 8, the bill passed by the House that requires background checks for private gun sales, including those at gun shows and over the internet. Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, has so far refused to take up the measure, which is strongly opposed by the N.R.A.
"We implore you to seize this moment when your leadership and influence over Republicans in Congress on the issue of guns is so critical," they wrote in the letter, which was obtained by The New York Times. "Please do not squander it by acceding to N.R.A.-backed proposals or other weak ideas that will do nothing to stop the continuing, horrific spread of gun violence and may, in some cases, actually make our communities less safe."
The letter is an effort to put Mr. Trump and Mr. McConnell into a box on gun control legislation -- and, perhaps, to ensure that Republicans and the president take the blame if nothing gets signed into law. The president initially expressed support in early August for "very meaningful background checks" after a pair of deadly mass shootings in Texas and Ohio but stopped short of endorsing the bill passed by the House. His stance, however, appeared to have softened -- as has been the case with Mr. Trump in the past -- after talks with gun rights advocates.
Mr. McConnell has said he expected the Senate to debate gun control sometime after lawmakers returned to Washington on Monday. But he has also said repeatedly that he would not put legislation on the floor for a vote unless Mr. Trump was willing to sign it -- a point that another member of the Republican leadership, Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri, echoed on Sunday.
"We are not going to vote on bills on the Senate floor that the president is not willing to sign," Mr. Blunt said on NBC's "Meet the Press." "The president needs to step up here and set some guidelines for what he would do."
The letter comes as the debate over gun control -- one of the most contentious and intractable issues in American politics -- is changing rapidly in Washington. So far this year in the United States, firearms have been involved in at least 38 mass killings, which the Justice Department defines as three or more fatalities in a single episode, excluding the gunman. In August alone, 53 people in the United States died in mass killings by firearms.
The shift is evident in Congress and also on the presidential campaign trail; gone are the days when Democrats like John Kerry, the 2004 presidential nominee, felt compelled to have themselves photographed going hunting. (The White House issued such a photograph of President Barack Obama in 2013.) Today's Democratic candidates are falling over one another to see who can issue the most aggressive gun safety platforms.
Yet some Republicans, especially in states where there have been mass shootings, are also calling for gun safety legislation. In Texas, where there were multiple deadly shootings in August, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, a staunch proponent of gun rights, called on Friday for background checks on private gun sales.
In Washington, the August shootings prompted Republicans to quickly rally around another type of gun control legislation: so-called red flag laws, which make it easier for law enforcement to take guns away from people deemed dangerous by a judge. In the Senate, Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, and Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, are sponsoring a red flag bill.
The massacres also revived talk of the bipartisan background checks bill known as the Manchin-Toomey bill, after its Senate sponsors, Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, and Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania. But the legislation, which includes exemptions for gun transfers for family members and friends, is not as expansive as the House bill, and many Republicans remain uncomfortable with it. It fell to a Senate filibuster in 2013.
At the direction of Mr. Trump, top White House officials have been engaged in bipartisan talks with lawmakers, including Mr. Manchin and Mr. Toomey, about what kind of gun legislation the president might be willing to support -- and what Democrats would agree to.
An administration official participating in the talks, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to disclose internal deliberations, said after a recent deadly shooting spree in West Texas that they were making "a lot of progress in good faith," but had reached no agreement. On Sunday, the official said the status of the talks was unchanged.
Mr. McConnell, meanwhile, has directed three top committee chairmen in the Senate -- Mr. Graham of the Judiciary Committee, Lamar Alexander of the health committee and Roger Wicker of the commerce committee -- to engage in "bipartisan discussions of potential solutions to help protect our communities without infringing on Americans' constitutional rights."
Passing gun legislation has long been one of the most intractable issues in Washington. Democrats typically talk about gun restrictions -- many are now calling for an assault weapons ban, which stands virtually no chance of passing the Senate -- while Republicans typically talk about the issue of mental health in relation to gun control.
During his "Meet the Press" interview on Sunday, Mr. Blunt expressed concern that the current debate would end in a stalemate, just as it did after the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.
"I'm afraid what's going to happen here is what always happens -- is we take this silly, 'If we don't get everything, we won't do anything,"' he said, "and fail to do the things we could do, with more early mental health help."

Air Force Will Review Layover Policies After Crew Is Placed at Trump Hotel

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The Air Force has ordered a review of its procedures used to decide where personnel are put up during overnight layovers, after conceding on Sunday that the decision to place a crew at the luxury resort owned by the Trump family in Scotland this year "might be allowable but not advisable."
The internal inquiry is being conducted at the request of Air Force leadership, which has directed the Air Mobility Command "to review all guidance pertaining to selection of airports and lodging accommodations during international travels."
This comes after the Air Force decided in March to send seven crew members flying on a C-17 military transport plane that was on its way to Kuwait from Alaska to the Trump Turnberry resort in Scotland, after the plane had a layover at an airport nearby.
On Saturday, an Air Force official defended the decision to place the crew at the Trump resort, saying that there were no other closer rooms available and that the discounted rate the resort charged meant the cost was below a spending limit.
But on Sunday, in a follow-up statement, the Air Force conceded that the decision might have created a public perception issue.
"While initial reviews indicate that aircrew transiting through Scotland adhered to all guidance and procedures, we understand that U.S. service members lodging at higher-end accommodations, even if within government rates, might be allowable but not advisable," said the statement issued on Sunday evening by Brig. Gen. Edward W. Thomas Jr., the chief Air Force spokesman. "Therefore, we are reviewing all associated guidance."
The issue, the Air Force said, is that even if the "aircrews follow all directives and guidance, we must still be considerate of perceptions of not being good stewards of taxpayer funds that might be created through the appearance of aircrew staying at such locations."
The Air Force also offered an explanation as to why the Defense Department had significantly increased its use of the Glasgow Prestwick Airport, which is about 20 miles from the Trump Turnberry golf resort.
The Air Force explained that it has moved in recent years to try to consolidate the number of places it uses as locations for refueling and stopovers and that the Prestwick airport has "more favorable weather than nearby Shannon Airport" in Ireland "and less aircraft parking congestion than locations on the European continent."
The Defense Department has been using the Prestwick airport since at least 2015, when it had 95 stopovers, but that number rose to 145 by 2016, and then 180 in 2017, 257 as of last year and 259 so far this year. The 259 stops this year included 220 overnight stays.
Since October 2017, records show 917 purchases at the airport worth a total of $ 17.2 million.
During the March 2019 stopover, the Air Force placed the crew at the Trump property after a local agent on contract with the United States government had "indicated that there wasn't a room available closer," the Air Force statement said. The Trump property charged the Air Force $ 136 per room, which the Air Force said was less expensive than a Marriott property, which had a rate of $ 161, and both were under the allowable maximum of $ 166.
Air Force officials have not yet said, in response to a question from The New York Times, if personnel were placed at the Trump Turnberry resort more than once.
But asked on Sunday if Mr. Trump's election in 2016 played any role in the decision to use the Prestwick airport more frequently, Mr. Thomas, the Air Force spokesman, said in a written statement, "Not that I am aware of."
In 2014, shortly after the Trump Organization bought the Turnberry golf course, Mr. Trump met with officials at Prestwick airport and agreed to work with them to help increase traffic at the airport, which has struggled financially because of a decline in passenger traffic. The agreement at the time included a plan to offer transportation from the airport to the Trump golf resort. Discounts have also been offered on rooms at the hotel to military personnel.
"We are thrilled to be partnering with Glasgow Prestwick Airport," Mr. Trump said during the visit to Prestwick. "They have a tremendous facility with a unique, rich history."
House investigators have asked the Pentagon to address a series of questions about increased Air Force flights to the Prestwick airport, and the potentially more troubling choice to put up Air Force personnel at the Trump Turnberry resort, questioning if perhaps this was part of some effort to help out Mr. Trump's family business.
"The airport closest to the Trump Turnberry golf course -- Glasgow Prestwick Airport -- has been viewed as integral to the golf course's financial success, yet it too has lost millions of dollars every year since its purchase by the Scottish government in 2013," said a June letter to the Defense Department from Representative Elijah E. Cummings, Democrat of Maryland and the chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee. "Given the president's continued financial stake in his Scotland golf courses, these reports raise questions."
The Turnberry golf resort generated $ 23.4 million in revenue last year for the Trump family, up by $ 3 million compared with 2017.

Texto completo: Should Elizabeth Warren do the right thing and drop out of the Democratic presidential race, so Bernie Sanders can address Joe Biden's multiple "reality issues" before taking on President Donald Trump?
Yes, immediately.
Bernie can beat Trump. Warren and other Democrats also match up well with Trump, but Sanders has the necessary authenticity. And Biden has a serious flaw.
If you can't see this, you might just be blind to Joe adrift, lost in his multiverse of fabrications and moist feelings, like a sad sci-fi astronaut with gleaming white teeth in a Netflix movie, unmoored.
For now, the hard-left vote -- the spine of the Democratic Party this cycle -- remains split between Warren and Sanders. If something's not done and soon, Biden may ride his whoppers to the Democratic nomination.
Democratic activists worry about Biden, but the national media, which is even further to the left than are the activists, also worry. They're trying to take Biden out with stories like the one in The New York Times the other day, depicting Biden as a confused bumbler: "Does Joe Biden Want to Be Doing This?"
So Biden is portrayed by many as a geezer lost in the discount drugstore after the shuttle bus has left.
Biden remains stubbornly on the national platter, congealing like day-old "Cold Omelets with Crab Meat," the now-infamous dish Warren offered as authentic Cherokee fare in the cookbook "Pow Wow Chow," back when she was climbing the political ladder as an authentic Native American Harvard law professor.
"You can't call on Warren to drop out," said a guy who's been counting all the "Warren Has a Plan for That" signs sprouting in his progressive North Side Chicago neighborhood. "She's a woman. And Democrats will need the white suburban woman vote in 2020."
True, and I mean no disrespect to her, her gender or to the Democratic Party's strategy to target that key suburban white female demographic through a relentless 24-7 media spin that's been going on since 2016.
But the charade of representing herself as a Native American, and the catastrophe of her DNA test, turns off working-class families. Democrats need them too.
The thing about an omelet with crab meat is that you've got to break some eggs.
And she'll have to break a few on Biden in the next Democratic presidential debate in Texas. But that could get messy, since Biden has support from older African Americans and older, more centrist Democrats who don't like the way their party is trending.
Sanders represented the progressive faction in 2016. But Hillary Clinton and establishment Democrats, through former DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz, rigged the primaries and leveraged all that Wall Street cash and the superdelegates to cynically take Sanders out.
Now progressive Democrats seem at a loss to stop Biden. It reminds me of how my brothers and I would wait outside our house for Uncle John, a restaurant man, when Aunt Mary called to tell us he was bringing his famous dessert over to our house.
We'd stand in the middle of the street and flag him down in his big gray sedan, waving our arms and shouting until he finally stopped. He was in his mid-90s and mentally quick. He just had trouble seeing. Still, it was worth the risk of getting flattened because Uncle John made great rice pudding.
But he wasn't campaigning for president.
Biden doesn't make rice pudding. Instead, Biden makes sweet and creamy feelings.
Bernie Sanders, at 77, is a year older than Biden but seems much sharper. He's a socialist, yes, and unlike Biden, he knows the difference between Vermont and New Hampshire.
Bernie went to Moscow on his honeymoon. He talks about free stuff -- free college tuition, "free" health care for all, even for immigrants who illegally cross the border. He probably should use Pete Seeger's version of "The Big Rock Candy Mountain" either as a campaign song or an economic platform.
Sanders doesn't have good hair, but who does? At least his locks are not orange. They're authentically white and grow wild and frizzy from Sanders' head like the hair of Rick Sanchez, the brilliantly sarcastic scientist in the "Rick and Morty" cartoons.
Sanders is a true lefty, not a faux lefty, and perhaps it would be a good thing for the country to have left and right meet in the November 2020 Thunderdome and just end this incessant bickering once and for all.
The problem is Joe's in the way. He's locked up key Democratic Party food groups and won't let go.
Biden's weakness is the weight of his lies. Trump lies, too, obviously, but then so did former Presidents Bush I and Clinton and Bush II and Obama. Americans reward politicians who lie, if the lies are offered with emotion or silkiness. Trump just blusters through, like a cheesy house announcer at a pro wrestling match.
The other day, The Washington Post outed Biden, known plagiarist and gaffe machine, for making up a story about his own heroism as vice president in a war zone honoring an American soldier.
"Biden got the time period, the location, the heroic act, the military branch and the rank of the recipient wrong, as well as his own role in the ceremony," the Post wrote.
He told that whopper to puff himself up, like some Commander McBragg. Biden insists such criticism is "irrelevant" and pushes ever forward, building a safe mind palace for himself on the shores of some golden pond, from which he will run his general election presidential campaign against Trump.
Unless Elizabeth Warren breaks some eggs, and soon.

Texto completo: Take the case of our blithe acceptance of the Electoral College. There is nothing normal or democratic about choosing our president through a system that makes it ever more likely that the candidate who garners fewer votes will nonetheless assume power. For a country that has long claimed to model democracy to the world, this is both wrong and weird.
And there is also nothing neutral or random about how our system works. The Electoral College tilts outcomes toward white voters, conservative voters, and certain regions of the country. People outside these groups and places are supposed to sit back and accept their relative disenfranchisement. There is no reason they should, and at some point, they won't. This will lead to a meltdown.
Our brewing troubles were underscored last month by the kerfuffle that Nate Cohn, the New York Times' political numbers guru, set off with a story that ran under the headline: "Trump's Electoral College Edge Could Grow in 2020, Rewarding Polarizing Campaign."
For election junkies, Cohn's analysis ignited quite a stir, especially since it set off a "Nate vs. Nate" Twitter skirmish between Cohn and Nate Silver, another brand-name data maven. (Yes, fate has made Nate a name of choice for people in this line of work.) Silver's main critique was fair enough: "There's just not that much we can say about the Electoral College right now beyond a couple of fairly loose priors (e.g. it's more likely to help than hurt Trump)."
Still, Cohn's calculations were revelatory. He stressed, for example, that higher turnout in 2020, which is generally seen as helping Democrats, could actually boost Trump in the key states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and especially Wisconsin by bringing out more of the Trump base.
As Cohn wrote, "the major Democratic opportunity - to mobilize nonwhite and young voters on the periphery of politics - would disproportionately help Democrats in diverse, often noncompetitive states." On the other hand, the GOP's opportunity is "to mobilize less educated white voters, particularly those who voted in 2016 but sat out 2018." This "would disproportionately help them in white, working-class areas overrepresented in the Northern battleground states."
Think about it: The Democratic nominee against Trump could beat him by far more votes than Hillary Clinton did in 2016 - and still lose. Clinton led Trump by 2.9 million popular votes, 2.1%. Cohn's conclusion: "It is even possible that Mr. Trump could win while losing the national vote by as much as five percentage points."
This means that the country could render a negative verdict on Trump's time in office by swinging away from him in a big way - and he would still be president for four more years.
Defenders of such a departure from one person-one vote say that if Democrats run up big leads in a few states and regions - especially California but also, say, New York, Illinois and New England - that shouldn't count. Their strained claim is that a president is somehow more "representative" of the country if he wins by eking out tiny margins in several Midwestern states. This transforms our democracy into a casino. If you narrowly hit the right numbers in some places, you take the pot.
What they are really defending, without explicitly saying so, is the idea that states with a higher percentage of white, non-Hispanic voters should have a disproportionate influence on who becomes president.
As a short-term strategic matter, Cohn is right to stress the importance to the 2020 result of states that were closely divided in 2016. But while I have great affection for the Midwest, I see no just reason for an individual voter in California having far less power than an individual voter in, say, Wisconsin or Michigan.
And the system's bias toward white voters only encourages Trump's habit of dividing the country along racial lines. So in addition to being undemocratic, the Electoral College encourages a particularly odious politician with no interest in uniting the country to do all he can to promote minority rule.
At some point, the majority will rise up. If Cohn's worst-case-for-democracy scenario materializes, 2020 could be that year. Our founders admitted that the Electoral College system they created in the original Constitution was defective by altering it with the 12th Amendment in 1804. It's time we followed their lead in showing the same willingness to scrap a system that is sending us headlong into a national crisis.

Texto completo: Mass shootings claimed the lives of 53 people in August alone, according to the New York Times. So far this year, according to the research group Gun Violence Archive, the United States has suffered more than one mass shooting per day, defined as an event in which four or more people are killed or wounded. The archive puts the death toll as of Sept. 3 at 313, but that figure includes domestic homicides and other killings. The toll, as of last week, according to the mass murder database compiled by the Associated Press, USA Today and Northeastern University, was 140, which equals last year's total with nearly four months to go in 2019.

Despite the growing slaughter, Republicans, including New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, continue to oppose even modest gun-control legislation. Echoing the failing NRA, they repeat the slogan: “Guns don't kill people, people kill people.” How many people, however, depends on the gun.
America, a nation that owes its existence to the colonists' proficiency with muskets, was destined to have a gun culture. Davy Crockett's Kentucky long rifle won the Midwest, Colt and Winchester won the West, and their lever-action rifles and carbines became iconic American guns.
Boys, for nearly a century, played cowboys and Indians or outlaws and lawmen with cap-firing replicas of Colt's .45-caliber “Peacemaker,” the long-barrel six-gun carried by Wyatt Earp as sheriff of Tombstone and John Wayne in many a Western movie. They dreamed, at Christmas, of a Red Rider BB gun.
Hunters dreamed of owning engraved Purdey shotguns, priced today somewhere between a Tesla and a condominium, or even a Winchester 12-gauge pump like writer Ernest Hemingway favored, a man's man until he took his own life with a different shotgun.
Any of those iconic weapons are capable of killing a number of people in a short time, but they needed to be reloaded after three, six or maybe 10 shots.
Somewhere along the line, the iconic American gun changed. Some say it was the Vietnam War, where the Armalite Rifle 15, America's version of Russia's AK-47 or Israel's Uzi, was the weapon of choice. The AR-15, later known as the M16 when it was adopted by the U.S. military, became the generic name for the modern “assault rifle.” Or maybe it was when ripped and bare-chested actor Sylvester Stallone appeared on the scene as John Rambo, a Vietnam War veteran who solved problems with his assault rifle, solved them, that is, with ultra-violence.
As America continued its move from country to city, hunting fell out of fashion. Bagging a hard-to-get restaurant table replaced bagging a deer as proof of manliness. The gun industry and the National Rifle Association, once a hunter-safety organization, found it far more profitable to sell fear in the form of an assault rifle for self-protection than sporting weapons designed for hunting and target shooting. To which Rambo, in the form of real-life actor Stallone, a gun law advocate, said, “Who needs an assault weapon? Like really, unless you're carrying out an assault.”
No amount of gun legislation, not the bills vetoed by Sununu that would have added background checks for commercial firearm sales, a waiting period for gun delivery and the ability to restrict guns on school property, would put an end to mass shootings. Neither would a ban on the sale of assault-style rifles or high-capacity magazines and bump stocks that have allowed so many shooters, almost all white males, to kill so many people in so little time. But gun laws would help to prevent some mass shootings and change a culture that has come to revere the wrong gun.

Texto completo: Five Days Gone
The Mystery of My Mother's Disappearance as a Child
Laura Cumming

Scribner: 320 pages, $26
--
One autumn afternoon in 1929, when Laura Cumming's mother was 3 years old, she disappeared from the beach where she was playing with her mother. "Short fair hair, no coat, blue eyes and dress to match: That was the description later given to the police," Cumming writes.
So begins one of the most compelling memoirs of recent years, with as many twists and turns as any mystery, a family history of great emotional resonance.
Little Betty Elston, as she was then known, was returned to her parents, George and Veda, after five days. She didn't learn about her own kidnapping until decades later.
There were other secrets too. The Elstons were not a family that spoke openly about things. Their home, stultifyingly quiet, lay in the tiny town of Chapel St Leonards in Lincolnshire, "the flattest of all English counties," Cumming writes, "the least altered by time, or mankind."
People in the village knew more of Betty's life story than she did; their reticence to share that knowledge renders them an uncommonly silent Greek chorus.
One of the other secrets was that Betty hadn't always been Betty. She was named Grace at birth by her unwed young mother and arrived as a toddler to live with George and Veda when they were both 49. The childhood she remembered was protective without being loving.
"Veda never played with Betty," Cumming writes, whether because she was overwhelmed by housework or perhaps simply "unaccustomed to small children, shy, uncertain, possibly undermined by the kidnap." The three lived with Veda's mother, whom Betty recalls as "very deaf, frail and alarmingly given to nosebleeds."
I say that Betty remembers her that way: Many of the book's most charming lines come from Betty herself -- the result of a memoir Betty wrote at Laura's request, a gift for her 21st birthday. And what a gift!
Both women are strong and graceful writers, and as a result "Five Days Gone" combines richly layered narratives and descriptions, including a window into Betty's younger life as remembered by her in middle age.
"Her life began with a false start and continued with a long chain of deceptions, abetted by acts of communal silence so determined they have continued into my life too," Cumming writes. "But to my surprise, the truth turns out to pivot on images as much as words."
Cumming, an art critic for the Observer newspaper, starts with the trove of family pictures taken by Betty's father, a hobbyist photographer. Betty appears happy and healthy; what she remembers, though, is "the photographer's tyranny," her father's gruff orders and overprotective bullying. The pictures begin with her adoption and end when she is 13, around the time she learns the secret and confronts her parents about it, only to meet more silence.
"We need images quite apart from anything else," Cumming writes, "when we have no words."
Cumming's previous book, "The Vanishing Velasquez," traced an art historical mystery story; here she widens her viewfinder, drawing on images as diverse as seaside posters, children's alphabet books and paintings by Degas and Fra Angelico. She's interested in memory, stories and images -- all of which can change meaning with the smallest shifts in perception.
"The lives of our parents before we were born are surely the first great mystery," she writes. It's a curiosity that stems in part from egoism -- how could the world exist before we do? -- but also comes from love.
The deep devotion of mothers and daughters runs through "Five Days Gone" like an underground river. From her own difficult and often cold childhood, Betty grew to be a devoted mother, fiercely connected to her children, telling them, "I never belonged to anyone until I belonged to you."
Perhaps that love is what makes this book so compelling, bestows on it a kind of grace that allows, in the end, for no villains. As Cumming discovers her family's truth, she writes, "I have grown up and learned about human frailty; the effects of foolishness and disappointment; the longing for a child."
The book begins and ends with two versions of the same tiny photograph, a circular tale that winds through nearly a century of family lives and lies. "She stopped searching long ago," Cumming writes of her mother, "but now I must discover the truth of her story." It's an extraordinary story and an even better book.

Texto completo: The director of MIT Media Lab has resigned after documents and emails showed that he attempted to hide close financial ties between his research center and Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex offender who died by suicide last month.
Joichi Ito resigned from his post at the prestigious educational center on Saturday after emails and documents obtained by the New Yorker detailed how faculty and staff at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology attempted to hide Epstein's ties with the university’s research. Ito had previously acknowledged that the university had accepted over $500,000 from Epstein directly, but the uncovered communications revealed that Epstein raised millions more for the research center from philanthropist Bill Gates and the investor Leon Black, according to the New York Times.
"After giving the matter a great deal of thought over the past several days and weeks, I think that it is best that I resign as director of the media lab and as a professor and employee of the Institute, effective immediately," Ito told MIT Provost Martin Schmidt in an email.
Epstein played a key role in soliciting $7.5 million from Gates and Black. MIT faculty directed staff to hide Epstein's connection to the donations. In Ito's office, Epstein was often referred to as Voldemort or "he who must not be named," referencing the main villain of the popular Harry Potter book series.
On at least one occasion, Ito solicited money from Epstein despite the financier being "disqualified" from donating to the university research center. Ito asked Epstein to donate $100,000 to prop up a certain research project for one more year. Epstein approved the payment, and MIT staff recorded the donation as "anonymous" because of its source.
Epstein died by suicide last month in his jail cell in New York while awaiting trial for child sex trafficking charges.

An Unusual Moment for 'The Daily'

Texto completo: On Thursday's episode, a Times colleague did something unusual -- for "The Daily," anyway: He expressed an opinion. The financial columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin told the story of his journalistic campaign to encourage the U.S. financial system -- retailers, banks, investment houses -- to change how it operates. Right now, few of them, if any, see it as their role to prevent gun violence or stop mass shootings. Andrew argued that they should, and has called on them to begin reporting suspicious transactions that might indicate a customer was planning a gun-related crime and to limit their financial relationships with companies that sell assault rifles. In his mind, it was in their capacity and was their moral obligation.
"The Daily" isn't an opinion show. Far from it. We're a news show that prizes our objectivity. So why did we decide to tell that story with this colleague? Because over time, Andrew's columns on this subject became part of the news. He was, in his own way, influencing the course of events.
After the mass shooting last month at a Walmart in El Paso, Andrew had written an open letter to Walmart's chief executive, Doug McMillon, asking him to use the company's economic might to reduce gun violence. The letter was met with a personal reply from the C.E.O. McMillon had read the column and wanted Andrew to know he was thinking about it. Then McMillon took action: He limited Walmart's ammunition sales, stopped selling handguns in the U.S. and called on Congress to consider a ban on assault rifles.
The more we explored the news, the clearer it became that Andrew was an ideal person to tell the story of how those in the financial system were thinking about guns, what steps they were willing to take, what risks seemed intolerable to them and the role of corporations in a polarizing societal debate like the one over gun control.
The next challenge was how to identify Andrew to our listeners, so they understood he was not a typical Times reporter, who wouldn't take a stance. We tried to do that in a few ways. In the show's introduction, we described Andrew as a columnist, and I mentioned his role again in the middle of the interview:
Michael: And as a columnist, distinct from a reporter in the newsroom, it sounds like you are taking the position that there is a kind of moral obligation within the financial system that, in your mind, they have not been awakened to or are aware of, that they can and should play a role in restricting or monitoring gun sales in light of these mass shootings.
Andrew: Absolutely. It's a responsibility, especially in an environment in which lawmakers seem so deadlocked on everything that nobody is willing to step up.
A few listeners wrote in to tell us that that wasn't enough.
"I really liked Andrew Sorkin today, but I think it's worthwhile for Michael to clarify (or double-clarify) that he's a columnist early on in the podcast," one listener said. "I think most people get the columnist/reporting distinction, but most of the U.S. seems to have forgotten and view all reporting with suspicion. I think 'The Daily' is great and would hate to see listeners confuse a columnist interview with a reporting interview and as a result be tempted to impute a bias to your interviews of reporters."
We hear you. The bar will always be exceedingly high for interviewing a Times colleague who expresses an opinion. And when we do, we will take pains to make sure listeners understand who the guest is and why we're doing it.

What we're listening to
Who: Michael Simon Johnson, a producer for "The Daily"
What: "How the Kochs Built an Industrial Empire and Reshaped Politics," from "The Interchange"
After hearing about the death of the billionaire businessman David Koch two weeks ago, I found myself with a renewed interest in the opaque world of the Koch brothers, the oil and gas titans who have been major forces in energy, philanthropy, conservative policymaking and climate skepticism over the last half-century. David and his brother Charles, of the multinational conglomerate Koch Industries, together had a net worth that rivaled the likes of Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos.
But how did the Kochs achieve all of this -- both the money and the influence? How have they managed to exert their will so forcefully onto American politics? What have their operating principles been over the years? These are some of the basic questions I've never adequately looked into, but have stayed on my mind as "Koch" became a household name.
Turns out it takes nearly seven years of investigative reporting to get the answers. Christopher Leonard, the author of "Kochland," went on a recent episode of "The Interchange" to talk about everything you forgot you wanted to know about the Kochs. Leonard is focused and surgical with his knowledge, laying out clearly and in detail how the brothers built up their empire, why they fought tooth and nail against any movement on climate policies, how their genius business strategies work, and, perhaps most fundamentally, what it is that Koch Industries actually does.
"The Interchange" is a podcast about the global energy transition, and this episode doesn't discuss the Koch brothers' philanthropic pursuits, like their interest in criminal justice reform, that might endear them to some of their critics. The show may not be everyone's can of grease, but if you're like me, you'll find this an excellent interview that you'll wish would, like a renewable battery, keep on going.

How black music made American music (plus a playlist)
"This is the sound not just of black America, but the sound of America."
Tomorrow, on a special episode of "The Daily," the Times critic-at-large Wesley Morris tells the story of the birth of American music. Black music, forged in unfree conditions, became the ultimate expression of artistic freedom -- and the bedrock of the nation's soundscape from Motown to yacht rock.
The episode is part of the new Times podcast "1619," hosted by Nikole Hannah-Jones. You can hear "1619" on "The Daily" on Saturdays, and we're also releasing it as a standalone show, with new installments published on Fridays. Listen to the latest at nytimes.com/1619podcast or by searching for "1619" wherever you get your podcasts.
And you didn't think we'd release this episode without a playlist, did you? Listen to music from the episode here:

On 'The Daily' this week
Tuesday: "When else do you get an opportunity for a midnight conversation with one of the most senior leaders of the Taliban?" Mujib Mashal tells us about covering the peace talks to end America's longest-running war.
Wednesday: Alex Burns gives the rundown on the tightening Democratic primary race: "We are very, very close to what will become a kind of sudden-death phase of this campaign."
Thursday: Walmart has stepped into the gun control debate, and "the rest of corporate America is watching," Andrew Ross Sorkin says. "What's the real economic impact of what they've done?"
Friday: As the 2015 nuclear deal unravels, a new Times investigation reveals the secret history of how close Israel, the U.S. and Iran came to war. Mark Mazzetti explains.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump's decision to renew talks with China in the coming weeks sent financial markets soaring, as investors seized on the development as a sign that both sides could still find a way out of an economically damaging trade war.
The rally sent the S&P 500 up more than 1%, underscoring just how much financial markets are subsisting on hopes and fears about the trade war. Shares fell through most of August, as Trump escalated his fight with China and imposed more tariffs, only to snap back on Thursday after news of the talks.
But expectations for progress remain low, and many in the U.S. and China see the best outcome as a continued stalemate that would prevent a collapse in relations before the 2020 election. Both Trump and President Xi Jinping of China are under pressure from domestic audiences to stand tough, and the talks will happen after Trump's next round of punishing tariffs take effect on Oct. 1.
"Continuing to talk soothes markets a little bit," said Eswar Prasad, the former head of the China division at the International Monetary Fund. "But the political cost to making major concessions is, I think, too high for either side."
Over two weeks, Trump has called Xi an enemy of America, ordered companies to stop doing business in China and suggested the U.S. was in no rush to reach a trade deal. On Sunday, he moved ahead with his threat to eventually tax every golf club, shoe and computer China sends into the United States, placing tariffs on another $112 billion of Chinese goods.
Stock investors have zeroed in on the threat the trade war poses to the economy, buying and selling in tandem with Trump's trade whims. Thursday's rally was the fifth positive performance for the market in the past six sessions.
The coming weeks could result in more of the same, analysts say: tough words when Trump wants to rally his base and a temporary cooling off when it seems to be hurting an economy that is one of his main arguments for reelection.

Texto completo: Democratic front-runner Joe Biden attempted this week to downplay concerns about his serial fabrications.
In doing so, the former vice president boasted that he would never be so terrible as to support a policy of placing illegal immigrant children in “cages” — a policy that the Obama administration, in which he served, absolutely did enforce.
Weirdly enough, our very brave and vigilant national news media either are unaware of Biden’s attempt to rewrite history or they just do not care. Reporters and commentators must be too distracted right now fighting with the president about his sharpie graffiti.
Appearing on CBS’ The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, Biden sought Thursday to tamp down criticisms of his multiple verbal flubs and outright falsehoods, including a recent speech wherein he botched basically every detail about a meeting he had with a war hero.
"Those details are irrelevant. The point I was making was relevant," the 2020 Democratic primary candidate told Stephen Colbert. “It's a different thing to say, when you're talking about honoring the bravery, or the sacrifice, or what other people went through, and the essence of it is absolutely true.”
"I was not talking about me," Biden continued. "I was praising ... the valor of all these people out there that I've visited in over 20 visits in Afghanistan and Iraq."
"The fact that I said that I was vice president,” he continued “well, in one case I was vice president-elect, the other case I was a senator. I'm not sure that's relevant."
Then Biden said this: “But I don't get wrong things like, we should lock kids up in cages at the border."TweetThe CBS audience erupted with thunderous applause. This is awkward, considering that the Obama administration, in which Biden served as vice president for all eight years, also had a policy of locking up undocumented children.
That Biden should embrace a falsehood in defense of his other falsehoods is a story that our national press, which keeps telling me that the truth is “more important now than ever,” should be eager to cover.
Nope. No such luck. As of this writing, the only newsroom really to note the chasm between Biden’s applause line Thursday evening and the actual immigration policies enforced by the Obama administration is the Washington Free Beacon. The rest of our undaunted and ever-vigilant press have focused instead on Biden’s general defenses of his misstatements and fabrications.
The Los Angeles Times, for example, ran a story that makes one reference to children in cages and does so only to point an angry finger at the Trump administration. There are no mentions anywhere in the story that this had happened under the Obama administration.
Similarly, the New York Times also published a light-hearted puff piece mentioning Biden's “kids … in cages” remark and Trump-era policies. But like the L.A. Times, it also omits all mentions of Obama White House enforcement.
ABC News was likewise careful to repeat Biden's “cages” line with a note explaining briefly that it is a “reference to President Donald Trump's immigration policy.” There is no mention that it happened when Biden was veep.
Reuters mentions the applause line and Trump White House immigration policies, but it likewise avoids mentions of similar policies that were enforced on Biden’s watch.
The Washington Post’s write-up of Biden’s Colbert appearance does not even mention the Trump administration immigration policies. It quotes the Biden line about “cages” and then moves on entirely in a different direction.
Fox News also took a pass on noting the former vice president’s historical connection to the controversial immigration enforcement policies that he now decries.
CNN did not even give the Colbert interview its own dedicated article. It merely posted a clip of the interview to its website with the headline, “Biden jokes about making Michelle Obama his VP.”
Maybe it is just me, but in covering Joe Biden’s remarks this week about being shocked — shocked! — that the Trump administration would lock up undocumented children, it might be worth also mentioning what happened during Joe Biden’s eight years in the White House.

Valerie Harper's death reminded me of my rant about 'Rhoda' and the great response I got

Resumen: A pioneering writer's answer to my frustrated letter about a TV sitcom crystallizes a key moment in feminist history. We were on the cusp of change.

Texto completo: It was 1975 and I was upset. Rhoda had just gotten married and suddenly her career seemed to have disappeared. It wasn’t as if being a free-lance window dresser was an inflexible, 24/7 job, and she didn’t even have any children to keep her busy at home. And yet she was getting subsumed into her marriage to Joe.
It’s true that Rhoda was a fictional character in a TV sitcom, but that made no difference to me. In fact it made it worse in a way: Here was a story that could be told any way the writers wanted, and my hopes for a feminist heroine were fading.
What happened next reveals so much about a time many women today can’t fathom: I typed an earnest, frustrated letter to the "Rhoda" show and received an earnest, frustrated reply from an "executive script consultant" named Charlotte Brown. Also typewritten.
Rhoda's career was 'backsliding'
All this resurfaced like a message in a bottle with the death of Valerie Harper, the star of "Rhoda. "
“Thank you so much for your sincere concern regarding RHODA,” Brown wrote. “I’m very sorry that we’ve been ‘depressing’ you with Rhoda’s ‘typical’ behavior. Yes, she has done some laundry, yes, she has done some cooking, but we have tried like hell to keep her out of the kitchen. "
The letter goes on to explain the responsibility the show felt to define Rhoda’s new marriage as two people “who love each other but who refuse to lose their individual identities in marriage. ” Brown went on, “Rest assured, Jill. We are filming a show next week … and it concerns just the situation you mention in your letter. ” That is, Rhoda’s concern about “backsliding” in her career.
“I think this will answer your objection to any ‘atrophy of the intellect’ or ‘alienation from people in general,’ ” Brown said, and thanked me for watching.
I don’t have my own letter, but this and other sections of Brown’s response make my mood and tone pretty clear: young, annoyed, fiercely feminist and extremely disappointed.
The 1970s 'Squad' wimps out
Why was I so put out? Twitter user Freddie Johnson got at part of it when he said of a photo of Mary Tyler Moore, Valerie Harper and Cloris Leachman, “In 1974, this was The Squad. ” And The Squad, in my view, was wimping out.
March of women's progress: #MeToo and inclusion riders are great. But should I worry about my son?
Strange but true, young and not-so-young women, it was not always the norm for married women to work. And when they did, before changes over “the past several decades,” the Labor Department noted in 2011, “women's work outside of home and marriage was restricted to a handful of occupations such as domestic service, factory work, farm work and teaching. ” It wasn’t until the very late 1960s that newspapers like The New York Times and Pittsburgh Post-Gazette stopped running separate male and female “help wanted” ads.
So it was unusual in the 1970s for women to work in a TV newsroom (like Mary Tyler Moore’s Mary Richards) or dressing windows (like Harper’s Rhoda). And it was especially revolutionary to see women like this on television. You need only look at the fare from the 1960s (with the possible exception of "Get Smart") to see what a departure these shows represented. In Moore’s role as a housewife during that decade on "The Dick Van Dyke Show," one of her revolutionary contributions apparently was wearing capri pants and flats at a time when most housewives still wore dresses and heels. At least on TV.
Letter writer was a feminist pioneer
Charlotte Brown, it turns out, was a full-fledged member of the 1970s Squad. “Virtually every series that I was hired to write on, I was the first woman the producer had ever hired,” she said in a WHOA! Network interview posted on YouTube, and the first woman in the writers' rooms “that wasn’t taking dictation or a lunch order. ” Though she never checked it out, she said, "when I started producing 'Rhoda,' I was supposedly the first woman writer-producer of a multicamera comedy. ”
Oscar nominee Regina King: My commitment to gender equality must only be the beginning
Brown is now 75 and no doubt has long forgotten the letter she wrote to an anxious young woman trying to escape a dead-end job and break into political journalism, another field that was not exactly overrun with women in 1975.
But America was on the cusp of a transformational era in the lives of women. Feminists like Brown and me and Valerie Harper were fortunate to be around at that moment, pushing for change and benefiting from the opportunities we helped create.

Trump has a favorite number when he makes big claims: 10,000

Texto completo: When President Donald Trump wants to convey that something is a big deal, he often reaches for the same big number: 10,000.
He says it's the number of points the Dow Jones Industrial Average would be up had the Federal Reserve not raised interest rates. It's the number of people attending his rallies -- or the number forced to wait outside because they couldn't get in.
It's also the number of jobs a company plans to create, the headcount of captured Islamic State fighters, the number of migrants in a caravan headed to the U.S., and the Allied casualty count on D-Day.
Sometimes the number is accurate. Other times, it's a wild guess -- or wildly wrong.
Trump on Wednesday predicted the Dow would be up -- another 10,000 points -- if he hadn't embarked on a trade war with China.
“If I wanted to do nothing with China, my stock market -- our stock market -- would be 10,000 points higher than it is right now," Trump told reporters in the Oval Office.
That would be a dramatic rise. With the Dow closing at 26,728 on Thursday, another 10,000 points would represent a 37% increase.
Memorable Number
From a marketing standpoint, there's a great reason to use 10,000: It's memorable.
“He uses this round number in particular because it seems big," said Jonah Berger, marketing professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, which Trump often boasts of attending.
“He wants to convey something is a big problem, or something would be quite different, so he uses a big round number to try and sway his audience," said Berger, author of “Contagious: Why Things Catch On."
Trump has used the number since his 2016 campaign -- in speeches, remarks to reporters and one-on-one interviews -- but it could take on new significance as he seeks to burnish his record with the approach of the 2020 election.
The president has repeatedly sought to use 10,000 to his political advantage, even when it doesn't neatly match reality.
'Horrible People'
For instance, he said in January that Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers last year removed 10,000 known or suspected gang members whom he described as “horrible people." (The agency actually reported arresting that number but removing 5,872 known or suspected gang members in fiscal year 2018.)
The White House declined to comment on Trump's use of 10,000.
The president has other verbal habits. He has often cited self-imposed two week deadlines for major announcements.
While Trump is often faulted by fact-checkers for making false statements, his spokeswoman has said journalists take the president's words too literally.
“I think the president communicates in a way that some people, especially the media, aren't necessarily comfortable with," White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham told the Washington Post in a recent interview. “A lot of times they take him so literally. I know people will roll their eyes if I say he was just kidding or was speaking in hypotheticals, but sometimes he is."
'Truthful Hyperbole'
Trump defended his use of what he called “truthful hyperbole" in his 1987 book “The Art of the Deal," calling it an “innocent form of exaggeration."
“People may not always think big themselves, but they can still get very excited by those who do," Trump wrote. “People want to believe that something is the biggest and the greatest and the most spectacular."
Wittingly or not, Trump has taken to a number that comes up often in history, religion and culture.
The army of the Ten Thousand marched against Artaxerxes II of Persia. During the conquest of Mecca, Muhammad was said to have 10,000 soldiers. The King James Bible has dozens of references to 10,000. Minnesota's nickname is the Land of 10,000 Lakes. A television game show called “The $10,000 Pyramid" debuted in the U.S. in the early 1970s.
But Trump's references typically are rooted in current affairs.
The president used the number in July to talk about attendance at a North Carolina rally where his supporters chanted “Send her back!" after he invoked the name of Representative Ilhan Omar, a Minnesota Democrat.
“We had thousands and thousands of people that wanted to come, and we said, 'Please don't come,"' Trump said. “It held 10,000 people. It was packed. We could've sold that arena 10 times."
Authorities said 8,000 people got into the arena in Greenville, filling it to capacity, according to WITN-TV in North Carolina. About 2,000 were denied entry and between 750 and 1,000 were in an overflow area, the station said, citing police estimates.
Booing Ryan
In July, Trump used the number to attack former House Speaker Paul Ryan after the Wisconsin Republican was quoted in a book saying the president doesn't know how government works.
“I remember a day in Wisconsin -- a state that I won -- where I stood up and made a speech, and then I introduced him and they booed him off the stage -- 10,000 people," Trump told reporters at the White House.
The president appeared to be referring to a December 2016 post-election rally in West Allis, Wisconsin, where he publicly thanked Ryan, who was in the crowd. Audible, but not deafening, boos were heard as Trump tried to quiet his supporters by telling them that Ryan had improved “like a fine wine."
Then there's job creation -- a Cameron LNG liquefied natural gas export facility in Louisiana or an Intel Corp. semiconductor plant in Arizona.
In separate statements, Trump said they'd each create 10,000 jobs.
Bringing Credibility
Whether Trump's use of the number is accurate or not, the specificity can bring credibility to the president's claims, said Manoj Thomas, a behavioral scientist and marketing professor at Cornell University's SC Johnson College of Business.
“Using a number to quantify a claim -- even implausible numbers -- makes it more credible because numbers are concrete," Thomas said. “Claims without any numbers, for example, 'The Dow would be much higher if not for the trade war,' are more difficult for the human mind to instinctively process because the information is abstract and lacks specificity."
Trump could add even more credibility to his claim by making the number even more specific, Thomas said.
For instance, Thomas suggested: “The Dow would be 4,600 points higher if not for the trade war."

The story of a legendary affair that leaves much to be desired

Texto completo: The English actress and writer Eileen Atkins debuted a stage version of "Vita & Virginia" - a play about the love affair between writers Vita Sackville-West and Virginia Woolf, based on 20 years of their written correspondence - in 1994. In a review of the play, which starred Vanessa Redgrave as Vita and Atkins as Virginia, the New York Times found fault with the production's static staging, which interspersed infrequent face-to-face encounters between the women with a simple recitation of text. "A couple of lecterns would have done the job just as well," the Times snarked. (A 2008 revival dispensed with the pretense of human interaction entirely, featuring actresses reading from scripts set on side-by-side music stands.)
A new film version of the play, directed Chanya Button from a script co-written with Atkins, opens up the story a lot, setting scenes in the two characters' homes and elsewhere, and including conversations with the women's husbands and various members of the bohemian Bloomsbury Group: painters Duncan Grant and Vanessa Bell (Virginia's sister), among others. But the title characters, who kindled a brief romance and carried on a much longer friendship, still feel like a couple of specimens preserved in glass jars. They can see each other, but they hardly seem to touch, even when they're in the same room - or bed - together. True to its epistolary roots, the film still features many interludes of the actresses (Gemma Arterton as the racy Vita and Elizabeth Debicki as the more reserved and depressive Virginia) quoting from the writers' letters as they stare straight ahead into the camera.
It hardly makes for scintillating cinema, even given the whiff of scandalousness with which Button and Atkins lay out the stages of Vita and Virginia's relationship: flirtation, seduction, consummation, then a kind of sisterly companionship. Only Isabella Rossellini, playing Vita's mother - so shocked by her daughter's previous fling with the socialite Violet Trefusis - manages to convey anything like drama. Even a subplot addressing Virginia's psychological breakdowns, probably because of bipolar disorder, plays out with an air of clinical detachment, and does little to engage the audience or shed light on who these women really were. An on-screen title card at the end of the film refers to Woolf's 1941 death, strangely, without mentioning that it was suicide.
"Vita & Virginia" may be about two fascinating characters, but it's also a case of words, paradoxically, obscuring the real people who wrote them.

Texto completo: Emily Doe is ready for you to know her name.
Before the world heard of the allegations against Harvey Weinstein, we learned of Doe, a victim of sexual assault at the hands of a Stanford University student whom a judge let off with a mere six-month sentence because "a prison sentence would have a severe impact on him."
Brock Turner, whose swimming accomplishments came up frequently in the trial, and whose name has become synonymous with privileges enjoyed by the white and wealthy, served only three months.
"The fact that Brock was an athlete at a private university should not be seen as an entitlement to leniency, but as an opportunity to send a message that sexual assault is against the law regardless of social class," Doe wrote in a viral, 7,000-word response to the sentence. "I fully respected his right to a trial, but even after twelve jurors unanimously convicted him guilty of three felonies, all he has admitted to doing is ingesting alcohol. Someone who cannot take full accountability for his actions does not deserve a mitigating sentence."
The #MeToo movement had not yet begun in 2015, when the 22-year-old was sexually assaulted behind a dumpster in Palo Alto, California. Since that January night, Doe also feels the "severe impact" of the trial, and she's ready to share her story and her name.
Doe's real name is Chanel Miller, and her forthcoming memoir, Know My Name, will explain how she went from accompanying her sister to a fateful fraternity party to becoming an eloquent crusader against sexual assault. In her memoir, Miller will likely address how she was consistently bombarded during the trial in 2016, with Turner's lawyer employing aggressive tactics to discredit her.
Miller wrote, "Instead of his attorney saying, 'Did you notice any abrasions?' he said, 'You didn't notice any abrasions, right?' This was a game of strategy as if I could be tricked out of my own worth." Although she was blacked out at the time of the assault, Turner claimed she "liked it."
Miller's book about the experience and her recovery is set to come out Sept. 24, and the cover art is particularly meaningful. The New York Times reports, "The cover art for 'Know My Name' is inspired by the Japanese art of kintsugi or 'golden repair,' in which broken pottery pieces are mended using lacquer and powdered gold. It's a process that makes a new, beautiful object out of what's been broken, emphasizing where it has cracked."
A literature major from the University of California, Santa Barbara, Miller is now a writer and an artist. If her book is anything like her powerful, poetic viral statement, Know My Name will have an equally significant cultural imprint.
"In newspapers, my name was 'unconscious intoxicated woman,' ten syllables, and nothing more than that," she wrote. "For a while, I believed that that was all I was. I had to force myself to relearn my real name, my identity. To relearn that this is not all that I am."

LEWISTON — LA Arts presents two extraordinary comic and graphic novel artists with ties to Maine in its LA Arts Gallery exhibition, “From Zombies to Zen: Cartoons and Illustrations by Dan Cote and Rick Parker.”
The exhibition is on view Sept. 4 through Oct. 11, and will be the featured exhibition for the Sept. 27 Artwalk LA. The LA Arts Gallery is at 221 Lisbon St. Gallery hours are noon to 4 p.m. Tuesday through Friday and 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Saturday. The exhibition is free and the community is invited to attend.
Rick Parker is an artist, cartoonist and writer, whose humorous work has appeared in the New York Times, The Village Voice, Life magazine and numerous comic books published by Marvel Comics. Parker is probably best known as the artist of MTV’s Beavis and Butt-Head comic book, published by Marvel from 1994-1996. He was on staff at Marvel for many years and did lettering and production work on seminal comic series such as Spider-Man, The Avengers, Captain America and GI Joe.
Parker drew the introductory pages for the Tales from the Crypt series and has worked on numerous graphic novels such as Harry Potty and the Deathly Boring published by PaperCutz. He is working on a graphic novel about his experiences when he was drafted during the Vietnam War 50 years ago. Parker and his wife, Lisa Trusiani, a writer and storyboard artist who also worked for Marvel Comics, live in Falmouth.
Born and raised in Lewiston, Dan Cote is a self-taught computer illustrator living in Los Angeles, California. He is the co-creator of Zen Intergalactic Ninja, a comic published by First Comics that he continues to draw 30 years after its debut. Cote and Steve Stern created Zen in 1985 when they met in Lewiston. Cote is a prolific experimenter. The first series of Zen comics was completely illustrated in airbrush, simply because he was infatuated with the technique and the results the medium could achieve. Original artworks using this technique are featured in the LA Arts show.
From “Zombies to Zen” is one of several comic and illustration events happening in L-A in September. On Saturday, Sept. 21, The Great Falls Comic Expo, 2019 Fall Edition, takes place from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. at the Gendron Franco Center. And Kimball Street Studios, 191 Lisbon St., will present “Infinite Canvas: Comics and Fantasy Illustration,” an exhibition of works by talented local fantasy art and illustration artists, in time for the Friday, Sept. 27, Art Walk LA.

Texto completo: Bobby Dillon, the Green Bay Packers' career leader in interceptions who lost his left eye following two childhood accidents, died Aug. 22 in Temple, Texas.
He was 89.
The New York Times reported that Dillon's daughter, Karen Gooch, said the cause was complications of dementia.
Dillon played safety for Green Bay from 1952 to 1959, setting the franchise record for interceptions with 52, including four against the Lions on Thanksgiving Day in 1953.
Dillon returned five interceptions for touchdowns and led the league in interception return yards in 1956 with 244.
Dillon led the Packers in interceptions in seven of his eight seasons, including three years with nine: 1953, '55 and '57. Irv Comp set Green Bay's single-season record for interceptions with 10 in 1943.
A native of Pendleton, Texas, Dillon moved with his family to Temple where he lived his entire life. After becoming an All-America defensive back and team captain at the University of Texas, Dillon was selected by the Packers in the third round of the 1952 draft.
Dillon was an AP All-Pro selection four times and was selected for the Pro Bowl four times, all while playing with a glass eye.
Cowboys, Elliott agree on contract
FRISCO, Texas - Ezekiel Elliott has a new contract with the Dallas Cowboys just in time for the regular season. The star running back and the club agreed Wednesday on a $90 million, six-year contract extension that will make him the NFL's highest-paid player at his position and end a holdout that lasted the entire preseason.
The breakthrough was finalized before dawn on the morning of the team's first full workout before Sunday's opener at home against the New York Giants.
Elliott will get $50 million guaranteed. The $15 million-per-year average on the extension surpasses the $14.4 million Todd Gurley got from the Los Angeles Rams last summer. Gurley's guarantee was $45 million.
Brown upset at Raiders for $54,000 in fines
ALAMEDA, Calif. - Star receiver Antonio Brown said Wednesday that the Oakland Raiders have fined him close to $54,000 for missing a practice and walkthrough last month.
Brown posted a letter on his Instagram account from general manager Mike Mayock saying that he was fined $40,000 for an unexcused absence from practice on Aug. 18 and $13,950 for skipping a walkthrough in Winnipeg on Aug. 22.
Rams lawsuit can be heard in St. Louis
ST. LOUIS - The Missouri Supreme Court has ruled that a lawsuit filed over the Rams' departure from St. Louis will be heard in a St. Louis courtroom, a defeat for the NFL team's owner who sought to send the case to arbitration.
The court issued its ruling Tuesday in a lawsuit filed by St. Louis city and county and the St. Louis Regional Convention and Sports Complex Authority, which owns the domed stadium where the Rams formerly played. It named Rams owner Stan Kroenke, who moved the team to Los Angeles for the 2016 season, the NFL and league owners.
Broncos, Empower ink 21-year deal
ENGLEWOOD, Colo. - The Denver Broncos have partnered with Empower Retirement on a 21-year deal to name their stadium "Empower Field at Mile High."
The Metropolitan Football Stadium District will meet later this week to sign off on the agreement that runs through 2039 and ends a three-year span without a title sponsor for the stadium that opened in 2001.
BASEBALL
City might waive River Bandits' rent
DAVENPORT, Iowa - The Davenport City Council might let the Quad Cities River Bandits take a full walk on its 2019 rent, given the flooding that restricted access and forced cancellation of baseball games at Modern Woodmen Park.
The Quad-City Times reports that 19 home games were canceled this year amid record-setting flooding that caused a flood barrier breach downtown. Before the barrier was breached in late April, access to the ballpark was also limited by Canadian Pacific Railway's unannounced project to raise its railroad tracks along the riverfront.
The team leases the city-owned park for about $273,000 per year. The flooding component of the lease has already automatically waived nearly $220,000 that would have been paid to the city. The proposal the council is considering would waive the remaining $53,000.
The matter came up at Wednesday's council meeting. If aldermen advance the measure, the waiver could be decided upon by city officials as soon as next week.
BASKETBALL
Player says dismissal due to dreadlocks
FORT SMITH, Ark. - An Arkansas university is investigating allegations that a men's basketball player was dismissed because the coach disapproved of his dreadlocks.
Tyler Williams alleges he was dismissed from the University of Arkansas-Fort Smith's basketball team last month after head coach Jim Boone criticized his hairstyle.
A complaint filed by Williams alleges Boone's action amounts to "racism and bias." Chancellor Terisa Riley confirmed in an email Tuesday the school is investigating but officials say Boone remains the men's basketball coach.
NCAA denies BYU's appeal of sanctions
PROVO, Utah - The NCAA has upheld sanctions against BYU's basketball program, which was forced to vacate 47 wins as a result of an improper-benefits case involving former player Nick Emery.
BYU's appeal of penalties announced in November was denied by the NCAA's Infractions Appeals Committee on Wednesday. The NCAA said a player, later revealed by BYU to be Emery, received more than $12,000 in benefits from four boosters. It ruled the school must vacate the wins and BYU was placed on probation for two years.
HOCKEY
Coyotes sign forward Keller to extension
GLENDALE, Ariz. - The Coyotes signed Clayton Keller on Wednesday to an eight-year contract extension with an average annual salary of $7.15 million, meaning the playmaking right wing could remain in the desert through the 2027-28 season.

Texto completo: Wendell Foster, a longtime city councilman, pastor and civil rights activist who blazed a trail for black lawmakers in the Bronx, died Tuesday. He was 95.
Born in Alabama during the Jim Crow era, Foster came to New York City on a Greyhound bus in hopes of a better life at age 13.
After becoming a minister and marrying, he and his young family settled in the Bronx. As economic and social conditions in the borough deteriorated in the 1970s, Foster (photo) felt compelled to run for office, telling The New York Times in a 2009 interview, "I realized there was little participation of blacks in the political system - at least they were not appointed or elected to office.
"So I began to try and organize the black community."
It took three runs for Foster to win the Council seat representing Highbridge, Morrisania and the South Bronx. The first black person elected to city office in the borough, he held the post for 24 years and was succeeded by daughter Helen Foster.
He was active in the civil rights movement, standing alongside the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. on the fateful march from Selma to Montgomery, Ala., in 1965.
Foster long led Christ Church in Morrisania, recently becoming its pastor emeritus.
"The liberation movement has never ceased: It's always been," Foster told the Times. "You'll always find a few nuts like myself out there, trying to better things."
Condolences poured in from Bronx officials.
"His work paved the way for African-American elected officials in the Bronx and I proudly stand upon his shoulders thankful for his service through the years," Councilwoman Vanessa Gibson said.
Foster is survived by his wife of 63 years, Helen Foster; daughters Helen and Rebekah, and a granddaughter, Gibson said.

Texto completo: Americans probably need more practice in sharing, writes Liz Soares.
Recently, my husband, Paul, and I settled down with our lunch plates at a Whole Foods Market. I’d noticed on a previous visit that the seating arrangement, which stretches along the front wall of the store, adjacent to the checkout lanes, had been changed for the better.
The square tables used to have four chairs per table, two on each side. Now all of the tables face a lengthy bench on one side, with two chairs per table on the opposite side.
I approved of this change. The bench made more seating available, and there seemed to be more tables than before. After piling up a plate in the takeaway area on the far side of the checkout lanes and then paying for my food, I wouldn’t want to have to stand up to eat it. That has never happened, but as an anxious person, it is always on my mind when I grab lunch at Whole Foods.
This sort of seating arrangement also fosters a sense of community. I remember when I first traveled abroad after college, I noticed that in Britain, it was perfectly acceptable to sit at a table that had empty seats, if no other tables were available. You’d ask before plopping yourself down, of course, but that was the extent of the protocol.
The new setup is good for people watching. So it was that I noticed when the woman at the next table got up, leaving a half-eaten pastry on the table and her pocketbook on the bench a few inches from me.
I thought perhaps she’d gone for utensils. Then a man came along and asked if there were seats available at this woman’s table. I indicated the pastry, which was on the side of the table farthest from me and said, “Just one person.”
He then swept the pastry over to the side next to me, and sat down. Soon he was joined by two other people. One was a woman I recognized. She had earlier offered to hold my plate as I struggled to put dressing on my salad. I’d thought that was a nice gesture.
She immediately noticed the pocketbook. “Has she been gone long?” she said to me. “Is she coming back?”
I shrugged. “She didn’t say.”
The absent woman soon returned. She did not express shock at seeing three strangers at her table. I might have uttered a small scream at the sight of my pastry being moved. But the woman, who was elderly, simply seemed perplexed.
She sat down, and the woman opposite her, who had held my plate for me earlier, started talking to her. The younger woman began with some pleasantries, but then she began asking the older woman where she had been. “You are very trusting to leave your purse on the seat,” she said.
As a keen observer of human nature, I was ready to burst. What the heck was going on here? Why was she grilling this woman? I have a pleasant demeanor and don’t come off as a common street criminal. The bag (and the pastry, come to think of it) had been safe, as it sat a few inches from me. If the older woman had not returned by the time we left, I would have brought it to customer service for safekeeping.
But as the conversation continued, I realized the younger woman was concerned. I thought then she might be a social worker, or a nurse, someone used to dealing with people who needed help. I don’t know if the older woman did need help, but the younger woman’s questions were clearly coming from a place of caring.
Americans are taught from an early age to value individualism. We fiercely defend our right to privacy. When the concept of socialism is bandied about, as it has been during this campaign season, there is much rending of garments and gnashing of teeth among certain segments of the population.
Yet, put people together at a lunch table and suddenly we see each other as neighbors. Come to think of it, that’s the kind of thing that’s being promoted in education today. Students who see a classmate eating alone are urged to invite them to join others at their table.
Another recent incident, however, demonstrated to me that Americans probably need more practice in sharing. I frequent another café with a communal seating arrangement. One day I watched as a woman set her things down at one table, then walked over to a man at another table. He was reading the Sunday New York Times, which was spread out in front of him.
“Is this the store’s copy?” she asked.
Much confusion ensued. It was the man’s copy, but she took a section of it anyway, promising to return it before he left.
I’m all for sharing, I really am. But don’t try to take my newspaper. That is where I draw the line.

Texto completo: The name, for many Democrats, evokes a golden-hued era in the White House, immortalized on Life magazine covers and in home movies of touch football on the lawn at Hyannis Port.
But the Kennedys, for all their luster as a brand, have had a remarkably checkered political history in recent years, as some of the children of John, Robert, and Edward Kennedy have stumbled in their bids for higher office or bowed out of politics altogether.
Their struggles in the family business suggest that voters — particularly those too young to have grown up with a bust of JFKon the mantel — no longer revere the dynasty, especially at a time when many have been rejecting elites and the political establishment.
Now, stepping into these crosscurrents comes the family's latest electoral hope, Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III, the 38-year-old grandson of Robert F. Kennedy and the only family member still serving in Washington.
He has signaled his interest in challenging Senator Edward J. Markey in the 2020 Democratic primary in Massachusetts, a race that would set up an intense intergenerational clash between two politicians with similarly liberal worldviews. Markey, 73, has served in Congress since 1976.
Kennedy, widely seen as a rising star who has emerged as a leading liberal voice against Trump-era policies, is eyeing higher office after a string of setbacks for the sprawling clan.
Last year, Christopher Kennedy, the eighth of Robert and Ethel Kennedy's 11 children, finished third in the Democratic primary for governor of Illinois.
His defeat came after Edward M. Kennedy Jr., the son of the late senator from Massachusetts, ended what many saw as a promising career in Connecticut politics by announcing that he would not run for governor in 2018 or seek reelection to the state Senate.
His brother, Patrick, a congressman from Rhode Island, retired from politics in 2011 to write a memoir on his struggles with mental health and addiction, and focus on mental health advocacy.
In 2009, Caroline Kennedy, the daughter of President John F. Kennedy, ran briefly for Senate in New York and was mocked for her awkward media appearances, including an interview with The New York Times in which she uttered the phrase “you know" more than 100 times.
And in 2002, Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, a daughter of Robert and Ethel Kennedy, failed in her bid to leap from lieutenant governor to governor of Maryland, losing to the first Republican to win that office in three decades.
“The electoral history has been mixed, and the reason is, it's been hard to extend the brand beyond New England," said Darrell M. West, a Brookings Institution scholar who has written about the Kennedys. “The bond is strong in New England but the region is also the most liberal politically, so people are more in tune with a Kennedy message of helping the downtrodden."
Kennedy has indicated he would run as a next-generation figure, championing “new ideas and a new approach," even though he is a scion of one of America's most prominent political dynasties.
“Congressman Kennedy's family is a huge part of his life, and he is incredibly proud of their record of public service," Emily Kaufman, the congressman's spokeswoman, said in a statement. “But in any race he runs, it's his name on the ballot. He runs on his own ideas, own record, and own vision for the future."
J. Randy Taraborrelli, author of “The Kennedy Heirs: John, Caroline, and the New Generation," said a Kennedy Senate campaign would fulfill the dashed hopes of his father, former representative Joseph P. Kennedy II, who was battered by political and personal scandals when he considered running for governor of Massachusetts in 1997.
Kennedy II was widely seen as the front-runner in that race until Sheila Rauch Kennedy, his former wife and Joseph P. Kennedy III's mother, wrote a book portraying him as a bully who tried to force her to grant him an annulment.
Soon after, Joseph P. Kennedy II's brother, Michael, was accused of having sex with a teenage baby sitter. A year later, Michael Kennedy died in a skiing accident, and Joseph Kennedy announced he would not run for reelection to Congress.
“That was very disappointing to a lot of people in the family — he had so much going for him, and they felt he had a chance at being the president," Taraborrelli said. “So I think it's interesting to see his son sort of going up the ladder of politics right now and being able to do so unafraid of the personal ramifications of that kind of decision, just considering what happened to his dad."
Taraborrelli said he suspects that Joseph Kennedy III's ambitions are important to a family that has long prized pitched competition and political success.
“They may say publicly that they don't care about this stuff anymore, but privately, they really do," he said. “They're still a family that wants to serve and loves politics, and it's in their DNA."
On the plus side for Kennedy, he would be running in a Democratic primary in the state where President John F. Kennedy was born, and that Edward M. Kennedy represented in the Senate for 47 years.
Philip W. Johnston, a former chairman of the Massachusetts Democratic Party, said Democratic voters here still associate the family name with peace, human rights, and other causes championed by JFK and RFK.
“It isn't the name, it's what the name conjures up for many voters, which can be very powerful because of the history of the family," said Johnston, who serves on the boards of two Kennedy family charities with Joseph P. Kennedy III.
Laurence Leamer, an author of three books about the Kennedys, said this state might be the only one where a Kennedy running for statewide office could tap so readily into the memories that many Democrats have of the family's storied history.
“It's a button you could probably successfully push only in Massachusetts," Leamer said. “It didn't work in Illinois. It didn't work in Maryland. And to an extent, people under 40 don't even care about this stuff."

Texto completo: The Kmart on St. Michael's Drive was still bustling Tuesday, but it won't be busy for long.
Transform Holdco LLC, the new parent company of the Kmart and Sears brands, announced Tuesday the Santa Fe Kmart and a Las Cruces Sears store are scheduled for closure in December as part of a nationwide shutdown of 100 stores. That's in addition to 26 store closures in October, announced a few weeks ago.
The St. Michael's Drive corridor where Kmart is located has been the topic of an on-and-off city revitalization effort, aimed at redeveloping the largely commercial zone, lined with strip malls and parking lots, into a bike- and pedestrian-friendly community with more housing.
Tranform Holdco, also known as TransformCo, acquired Sears Holdings Corps. earlier this year, after the Illinois-based retailer filed for bankruptcy and closed nearly
200 stores. Its former chairman, Edward Lampert, reached a $5.3 billion deal with TransformCo to keep 425 stores open, the New York Times reported in January, but multimillion-dollar losses continued this year.
"After careful review, we have made the difficult but necessary decision to close the Kmart store in Santa Fe, N.M.," TransformCo spokesman Larry Costello said in an emailed statement. "We encourage customers to continue shopping on Kmart.com for all their product needs."
Liquidation sales at Kmart will begin in mid-September, and the shutdown is planned for mid-December, Costello said.
Tuesday afternoon, long lines of customers taking advantage of lingering Labor Day sales on jeans, shoes and other items stretched from four Kmart registers.
Employees declined to comment on the closure announcement, saying company officials prohibited them from speaking to reporters. One employee said workers had received notice Friday; the employee wasn't sure if the company would offer severance pay.
A manager, who declined to give his name, referred all questions to TransformCo's corporate communications office. He would not confirm a closing date or the number of employees affected.
"I still have a job I gotta do," he said.
Costello did not answer questions about how many employees at the Santa Fe store would lose their jobs.
The 2017 closure of Sears, a onetime anchor store at the Santa Fe Place mall, and the loss of Albuquerque locations were casualties of the national chain's downsizing as online sales and fierce competition from Target and Walmart dominated the retail market.
Meanwhile, Sears Holdings Corp. still owes about $46 million to creditors amid an ongoing dispute over which part of the company will pay up, according to the most recent Securities and Exchange Commission filings.
In New Mexico, Kmart locations remain only in Farmington and Hobbs. Sears will continue to operate stores in Taos, Silver City, Ruidoso Downs, Hobbs, Farmington, Carlsbad and Belen.

Planned Parenthood cares about abortion above all, even patients' health: Today's talker

Texto completo: A former Planned Parenthood Arizona employee was awarded $3 million last month after a jury found she was wrongfully terminated when she alerted her supervisors to ongoing, unsafe medical practices.
Protecting it's abortion business
By Denise Burke
For years, Planned Parenthood paraded the misleading claim that abortion made up only 3% of its services. And while the abortion giant has flown that flag a little lower since that statistic was thoroughly discredited, perhaps what Planned Parenthood meant to say all along was that abortion safety plays a minuscule role in its operation.
That’s what Mayra Rodriguez found when, after more than 15 years working for Planned Parenthood clinics across the state, she uncovered a disturbing trend of shoddy abortion patient care that was putting women’s lives at risk. While what she found shocked her, it will come as no surprise to those who are well-acquainted with the duplicity behind Planned Parenthood’s carefully crafted public façade.
What Mayra uncovered wasn’t just enough to get her fired from Planned Parenthood. It was enough to spur a jury to award her $3 million in a recently decided wrongful termination lawsuit in Maricopa County, Arizona.
Protect women: My rapist fought for custody of my daughter. States can't keep survivors tied to rapists.
It’s also enough to convince anyone with an open mind that Planned Parenthood prioritizes abortion above all else — even if that means voluntarily cutting itself off from Title X funding and charging poor women more money to make up the new shortfall in government funding.
Planned Parenthood’s commitment to abortion also overrides even the most basic standards of care for the women who enter its doors.
Lawsuit exposes disturbing practices
Named “employee of the year” in 2016, Mayra began noting serious health and safety violations at Planned Parenthood the following year. As her lawsuit describes, Mayra was summarily fired after raising multiple concerns.
Within days, her bosses had destroyed key documents that captured a series of dangerous and very likely illegal actions from the Planned Parenthood abortionists she oversaw as a clinic administrator.
As she dug deeper into a troubling uptick of patients Planned Parenthood was sending to the hospital with “substantial post-abortion surgery complications,” Mayra traced the trend to one Planned Parenthood abortionist in particular.
On one occasion, a medical assistant confirmed that this practitioner carried out an “incomplete abortion,” where one or more body parts from the aborted baby remained in the mother’s womb. Incomplete abortions can lead to serious infection, sepsis and even septic shock.
Whistleblower's story is not unique
That was no isolated incident. Mayra soon found out that, before the abortion was even performed, the same abortionist — who still works at Planned Parenthood — had his medical assistants prematurely complete medical forms affirming that they had ensured that all the body parts from the not-yet-aborted baby had been removed from the womb.
The law lets men off easy: Want to end abortion? Hold men — fathers of those unplanned children — accountable.
But that isn’t all Mayra saw before she was kicked to the curb. In September 2017, Mayra learned that, in violation of state law, a Planned Parenthood clinic she oversaw failed to report carrying out an abortion on an underage teen who had an adult sexual partner. Mayra reported this to a supervisor and, one month later, she was dismissed.
Mayra Rodriguez is not the first Planned Parenthood employee to speak out on the organization’s startling disregard for the health, safety and well-being of its patients — including allegedly minors. Abby Johnson is a former Planned Parenthood clinic director with a story similar to Rodriguez’s, and it is every bit as grim as Mayra’s.
The lesson is simple. Planned Parenthood will protect its abortion business at all costs. Even if that means it sends some women to the hospital — or worse.

What others are saying
Bryan Howard, Planned Parenthood Arizona statement: "For 85 years — since 1934 — Planned Parenthood Arizona has provided health care and health information to hundreds of thousands of Arizonans according to stringent quality and safety standards. Our patients' health and safety is our highest priority. . . . We support the role of our court system in ensuring workplaces are safe, fair, inclusive and comply with the law. We believe the outcome in this instance was not supported by the facts. While we disagree with the verdict and the damages award, we will not allow this event to distract from Planned Parenthood's 100% focus on protecting access to health care for those Arizonans who need it most. We will consider next steps with that priority in mind. "
Mayra Rodriguez, statement: "I hope my case is a lesson to other workers that shows them that the truth will prevail. I also hope my case is a lesson to employers who abuse their power: Sometimes the underdog wins, and justice will be done. . . . Planned Parenthood publicly states they want to help and stand up for immigrants, that they care about these women, but it’s not true. They shamed me for my immigration status. But here we are, the jury heard the truth. "
Leana S. Wen, The New York Times: "In my farewell message to (Planned Parenthood) colleagues, I cited philosophical differences over the best way to protect reproductive health. While the traditional approach has been through prioritizing advocating for abortion rights, I have long believed that the most effective way to advance reproductive health is to be clear that it is not a political issue but a health care one. . . . There was immediate criticism that I did not prioritize abortion enough. While I am passionately committed to protecting abortion access, I do not view it as a stand-alone issue. . . . In the end, I was asked to leave for the same reason I was hired: I was changing the direction of Planned Parenthood. "
What our readers are saying
She made what appear to be valid complaints about procedures and personnel, and this ended up with (Planned Parenthood) using its system to get rid of her. That speaks to the arrogance of its leadership. . . . Good for Ms. Rodriguez. She fought a lonely battle.
— Jack Lavelle
Let this nation know the Trump administration is effectively backing abstinence. How funny is that coming from him. Should we follow his lead on how he does it?
— Jacqueline Blaszka Campbell
Good. I hope that this will be the beginning of the end for Planned Parenthood.
— Jason Martin
I can see why the 1 percenters and the poorly educated vote Republican, but why would women vote for them?
— Wayne Leslie

Texto completo: WASHINGTON—Former White House counsel Greg Craig was acquitted by a federal jury on Wednesday on a felony false-statement charge , a major vindication for one of the most prominent lawyers in Washington.
The jury acquitted Mr. Craig, who served as a top counselor to two Democratic presidents and a secretary of state, after less than five hours of closed-door deliberations at a courthouse in downtown Washington, D.C.
The acquittal lifts a pall over Mr. Craig's otherwise distinguished career at the upper echelons of law and politics, and represents a major setback for the Justice Department, which sought to make an example of Mr. Craig as it ramped up its enforcement of the laws governing work on behalf of foreign governments.
"The question that you need to ask isn't why this jury acquitted Greg Craig, but why the Department of Justice brought this case against an innocent man in the first place," defense attorney William Taylor III told reporters outside the court house. "It's a tragedy; it's a disgrace."
The charge against Mr. Craig stemmed from legal work Mr. Craig performed for the government of Ukraine in 2012. He and his then-law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP were hired to write an independent report for the Ukrainian Ministry of Justice evaluating the fairness of the trial of an opposition politician.
For two weeks, federal prosecutors and Mr. Craig's defense lawyers sparred over the nature of Mr. Craig's work for Kiev.
The case against Mr. Craig turned on the question of why he contacted several media outlets, including the New York Times, Los Angeles Times and National Law Journal. Legal work for a foreign government of the kind Skadden was hired for wouldn't necessarily trigger an obligation to register with the Justice Department as a foreign agent, but public relations work aimed at U.S. news outlets would.
Prosecutors contended that he was acting as an agent of Ukraine and working on the media rollout with several of the country's hired PR agents. They claimed he made several false and misleading statements about his media contacts to the Justice Department unit that enforces the Foreign Agents Registration Act, or FARA, in order to avoid the need to register.
Mr. Craig took the stand in his own defense in August, and said that he wasn't acting on behalf of Ukraine when he contacted several reporters. Rather, he told the jury, he was concerned about the integrity of the report he had written and wanted to ensure that Kiev and its PR agents didn't misrepresent its conclusions.
"Mr. Craig wanted to be sure that the New York Times got the story right," argued William Murphy, a member of the defense team, during closing arguments Tuesday. He later added that Mr. Craig "did not tell the Ukraine what he was going to say. He was not acting at their instruction."
The investigation into Mr. Craig grew out of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and was referred to federal prosecutors in Washington.
One juror, speaking to reporters after the close of the trial, criticized the government—including Mr. Mueller—for pursuing the case. "I was deeply offended personally, as an individual, by this—that this particular case was brought against this particular man. I mean, where are the convictions related to Russia? Why did this get to the front of the line?" juror Michael Meyer said.
Mr. Meyer said he found Mr. Craig to be a credible witness, but added that some of the other jurors didn't believe Mr. Craig was "entirely forthright in all of his representations."
Mr. Craig is the highest-profile Democrat to face charges from the Russia probe, having served in both the Clinton and Obama administrations. Mr. Craig served as a top adviser and lawyer to President Clinton during impeachment proceedings, as well as White House counsel for a year under President Obama. He served as a counselor to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and as a foreign policy adviser to Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy.
Mr. Craig also has had significant trial experience, serving as part of the legal team that helped defend John Hinckley Jr., the man who attempted to assassinate President Reagan in 1981.
At trial, Mr. Craig was represented by a top-flight legal defense team comprised of several veteran trial lawyers from the firm Zuckerman Spaeder LLP, including partners William Murphy, Mr. Taylor and Paula Junghans. The legal team made the unusual decision to put Mr. Craig on the stand as their final witness—a maneuver rarely seen in criminal trials because of the risks of cross-examination.
Had he been convicted, Mr. Craig was unlikely to get significant jail time. Although the law he was charged under allows for up to five years in prison, first-time offenders typically get far less jail time on similar charges.
One of Mr. Craig's legal associates at Skadden, Alex van der Zwaan, pleaded guilty to lying to federal investigators during the Mueller investigation and served a 30-day sentence at a minimum security prison.

Texto completo: The Boston Globe on Wednesday named Bina Venkataraman as its new editorial page editor. The 39-year-old Somerville resident brings a varied background as a journalist, author, and thinker on environmental and science matters to one of the highest profile jobs at New England's largest media company.
In a statement Wednesday, Venkataraman said she wants to see the Globe amplify “diverse voices of our city and better showcase Boston's groundbreaking ideas and knowledge, while holding our leaders and institutions accountable for meeting high expectations for public service."
“The Globe Opinion section has the opportunity to feature more of the voices and perspectives that hail from the many Bostons that exist today," she said. “We have the chance to reflect the richness of this region's vibrant neighborhoods and cultures, its world-class thinkers and community activists, its history-keepers and technology trailblazers."
During a brief phone interview Wednesday evening, Venkataraman spoke of the importance of level-headed editorials at a time when the country is at “perhaps a historic level of political polarization."
“There are a lot of opinions in our media environment right now, and a lot of people are able to offer their opinions, so it raises the bar for what we produce," she said.
Venkataraman has lectured on science communication, science writing, and the shaping of science policy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology since 2011. She is currently a fellow at the think tank New America, and the director of global policy initiatives at the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT. She will assume her Globe position in November.
A graduate of Brown University and Harvard Kennedy School, Venkataraman has previously covered health and science for the Globe, and had stints as a Globe metro correspondent and on the Globe's editorial board. She also worked on the science desk of The New York Times. In 2013 and 2014, she served as a senior adviser for climate change innovation in the Obama White House.
Her book, “The Optimist's Telescope: Thinking Ahead in a Reckless Age," was released in late August. On Wednesday, she said the book “dispels the myth that human nature and human society is condemned to be short-sighted."
“It's about how we can reclaim the ability to think about the future and plan for the future," she said.
In announcing the hire, the Globe's managing director, Linda Henry, called the paper's editorial board “one of the strongest and most vibrant editorial boards in the country."
“We tackle big issues in bold ways as well as subtle and everyday challenges," she said. “We thoughtfully look for ways to advocate, to progress, and to help others use their voices to inform and inspire others. We are thrilled and fortunate to add Bina's perspective and leadership to our board."
Venkataraman takes over the role from Ellen Clegg, who retired last year. Globe business columnist Shirley Leung served as interim editorial page editor before returning to her column this spring.

Texto completo: LONDON -- The literary heavyweights Margaret Atwood, Salman Rushdie and Elif Shafak all feature on the shortlist for this year's Booker Prize, one of the world's most prestigious literary awards.
Atwood, who won the Booker Prize in 2000, is shortlisted this year for "The Testaments," the highly anticipated sequel to "The Handmaid's Tale," which is to be released in the United States and Britain next week.
"It's a savage and beautiful novel that speaks to us today with unusual conviction and power," Peter Florence, the chairman of the judging panel, said at a news conference in London on Tuesday announcing the shortlist. He said that he could not reveal details of the plot because of a nondisclosure agreement, but added that he could not wait for readers to get their hands on it and know "what a global superstar can do at the height of her power."
The other books are:
■ Lucy Ellmann's "Ducks, Newburyport," an experimental novel about a middle-aged woman in Ohio ruminating over her life while baking. It is told almost entirely in one sprawling sentence. "98 percent of those who pick it up will think it unspeakable guff," Alex Preston wrote in The Observer, adding: "The 2 percent who get it will really get it."
■ "Girl, Woman, Other," by the British-Nigerian writer Bernardine Evaristo, which tells the stories of 12 women in a mix of poetry and prose. Its form is "breezily dismissive of convention," Emily Rhodes wrote in The Financial Times.
■ Chigozie Obioma's "An Orchestra of Minorities." At first glance, it is a romance between a Nigerian poultry farmer called Chinonso and a woman he stops from killing herself, but it quickly becomes a tale of class, race and male rage. "It's a story as old as the epic, but, sadly, an all too modern one," Esi Edugyan wrote in The New York Times.
■ Salman Rushdie's "Quichotte" is a retelling of "Don Quixote," reworked so that its main character is a traveling salesman who drives across America. Rushdie's "Midnight's Children" won the 1981 Booker Prize, but his latest novel has received mixed reviews. Parul Sehgal, in The New York Times, called it the latest example of "a writer in free fall."
■ Elif Shafak's "10 Minutes 38 Seconds in This Strange World," in which a murdered prostitute recalls her life as she lies dying on a landfill. Shafak "teases beauty and humor from a grim tale," Melissa Katsoulis wrote in The Times of London.
These titles were chosen from a longlist of 13 books, including John Lanchester's "The Wall," and Deborah Levy's "The Man Who Saw Everything."
In recent years, the Booker Prize has been surrounded by a controversy about whether American authors should be eligible. The prize has been dominated by authors from the United States since a rule change in 2013 that allowed any one writing in English to win, rather than just authors from Britain, Ireland, Zimbabwe and Commonwealth countries.
Last year, a group of authors that counts Atwood and Ian McEwan among its members demanded the rule be reversed. But this year, there have been no such calls. Ellmann, who was born in Illinois, but moved to Britain when she was 13 and now lives in Edinburgh, is the closest to an American nominee.
The winner is to be announced Oct. 14 at a ceremony in London and will receive around $ 61,000.

Texto completo: A new study of worldwide wealth showed the bottom 20% of U.S. income earners were wealthier on average than people in most European countries.
The study, conducted by Just Facts, released last week found the bottom fifth of American citizens "consume more goods and services than the national averages for all people in most affluent countries," including European countries on a per capita basis. Individuals in the poorest 20% of the United States on average have more material resources than those in Canada, the United Kingdom, and Japan.
The analysis examined income, charity, and noncash welfare benefits to determine how many goods and services people consumed in each country. Henrique Schneider, the chief economist of the Swiss Federation of Small and Medium Enterprises, said the study "provides valuable insight into poverty measures."
The study placed itself in opposition to a video op-ed by the New York Times published in July, which claimed the U.S. was not the greatest country in the world, but had more in common with "developing countries."
Just Facts noted that poverty rates only "measure relative poverty within nations, not between nations" while their study focused on consumption as a measure of wealth.

On The Beach: A Gull’s-eye View

Texto completo: Here are three good things about gulls:
1. They are devoted parents.
2. Males share child care equally with females. That includes sitting on the eggs during incubation.
3. And they have figured out a way - actually many ways - to survive in a harsh and unforgiving world. Some eat clams, some eat fish, some are attracted to landfills.
Of course, a few will divebomb you at the beach or boardwalk to steal a french fry, or the cheese on your cracker, or an entire slice of pizza.
The beach pirate approach to survival is, of course, where humans and gulls clash. And the outcry from humans is almost as loud and outraged as the cries of the gulls themselves. Several recent news articles have chronicled the predations of gulls and some possible remedies.
Ocean City, New Jersey, is bringing in hawks, and some scientists have suggested staring directly at gulls to fend them off. Though that is hard to do when the birds sneak up behind you.
There are some reports of more serious trouble. In England, a woman said a gull carried off her Chihuahua, and in Russia, a pilot was hailed as a hero for safely landing his plane after a collision with a flock of gulls. In the New York area, thousands of birds, including gulls, have been killed in the decade since the Miracle on the Hudson crash to clear the skies for airplanes, without an apparent reduction in bird strikes.
But it is at the beach where tempers flare. And in times like these, with heightened human-gull tensions, very little has been written about the gulls’ point of view.
Is there a Lorax who speaks for the gulls? Admittedly, gulls have quite a strong voice of their own, it’s just that it’s pretty unintelligible to most of us.
I called Christopher Elphick, an ornithologist at the University of Connecticut. He spends a lot of time studying sparrows but has a soft spot for gulls.
“They’ve found a way to succeed in the world,” he said. “So much biodiversity is suffering and disappearing and being lost. A part of me wants to just celebrate the fact that there are some organisms that can adapt and do well.”
There are more than 100 species of gulls worldwide, and they are doing well, by and large. Some live nowhere near the sea, which makes birders and ornithologists allergic to the term sea gull, although renegade friends of common language have called this attitude “birdsplaining.”
A few, like the ivory gull in the Arctic, which is near threatened, and the black-billed gull in New Zealand, which is endangered, are in trouble, but most are not.
The gulls that people are most likely to encounter on northeastern beaches in August are herring gulls, great black-backed gulls, ring-billed gulls and laughing gulls. Some of their populations are declining, but that is probably because they reached historic highs in the 20th century.
Before that time, some of those gulls were not found in New York or New Jersey. Herring gulls were first spotted nesting on Long Island in 1931, for instance. They began to spread in the 1960s and peaked in the ’80s.
Elphick said, and ornithologists and birders speculate, that the closing of open landfills like Fresh Kills on Staten Island may have something to do with the drop in numbers since then.
Sarah J. Courchesne has been part of a summer gull research program at the Shoals Marine Laboratory on Appledore Island, Maine, since 2008.
She admits that the herring gulls and black-backed gulls there do not always take kindly to visitors. But these are breeding colonies, and the researchers take young birds off the nest, examine them and put identification bands on them.
“This is like somebody walked into your house in the night and picked up your child and tried to walk off with them,” she said. “You would be alarmed.”
As are the gulls. So much so that the volunteers wear bike helmets and sometimes ponchos. Gull poop can ruin a shirt.
“Some gulls are just kind of psycho and others are really chill,” she said. Some birds sit quietly on a nest and allow themselves to be lifted off by volunteers who check the babies.
And the same variation occurs in how any given gull makes a living. Thousands and thousands forage for clams, follow fishing boats and shop at the local landfills.
“We have gulls that are never seen on beaches, and we know that because we have GPS loggers on them and they just never go near people,” Courchesne said. “They are 100% out at sea fishing for their own food.”
“I can’t deny that there are gulls that are stealing food,” she added. “And I can’t deny they are really good at it.”
But the thieves are specialists. And to give credit where it is due, they have worked at their trade. “If you’re dealing with a gull that is really talented at stealing food,” Courchesne said, “that gull has perfected the technique, possibly over the course of years.”
Also, the behavior that bothers humans so much begins with humans themselves.
“Everybody who goes to the beach and gets aggravated by a gull has previous humans to thank for it,” Courchesne said. You may not have given the gulls food, but somebody else did, and gulls are fast learners. At nearby beaches on the mainland, she said, “You’ll see people drive up to the beach and they’ll just dump an entire container of french fries out their window so the gulls come.”
Elphick agreed. “We’re slobs,” he said. “If we didn’t leave food lying around, they wouldn’t be doing what they’re doing.”
Courchesne, a veterinarian, teaches biology at Northern Essex Community College as well as being one of the leaders of the gull program at Appledore. (Her students often volunteer for the gull program.) She came to gulls partly because she loved birds, and even in veterinary school she knew she would not be treating pets.
She often hears from the public, since a major part of the research at Appledore involves banding young gulls and getting reports about where they turn up. She tries to turn correspondents into gull admirers or, at least, gull tolerators.
“People say: ‘So here’s a bird, it tried to steal my sandwich. It has a band on it, so I guess you want to hear about it,’ ” she said.
“We’ll tell them the whole history. Some of these birds are 12 to 15 years old.” She tells them how many offspring they have and what devoted parents they are, and how the “mother” that they saw may well have been a male helping his young.
Late August is “high time for harassment,” she said, because the young have fledged and their adult parents take them to foraging spots, which include beaches and boardwalks, to find food and to teach them the ropes. The gulls, like the humans, bring their whole families. “They’re being so pushy for food because they’re such committed parents,” she said.
“I have really come to love them. They’re my favorite birds. They’re so scrappy, and they’re overlooked.”
What does she recommend that the public do about gulls?
“I would recommend to people that they spend some time just bird watching,” Courchesne said. “Sit back and watch what they do.
“If you give them a little time and devote your attention to them, you will see this great intelligence behind that eye and this caginess, and this generalist sensibility that I think is very relatable to a human. Because it’s kind of the same way we go through the world.”

Texto completo: As he wrapped up a brunch shift at the Australian cafe Two Hands in the Little Italy section of Manhattan, Christopher Mortenson saw his phone light up. All afternoon, he had been waiting for the notification: ABC Cocina, an upscale Latin American restaurant in the Flatiron district, needed a line cook. He had an hour to get there.
When the shift ended, Mortenson started sprinting uptown. On his way to the restaurant, he ducked into a supply store to pick up a white chef’s jacket, which he threw over his T-shirt. He arrived at ABC Cocina just before 5 and spent the evening charring peppers with a blowtorch and stuffing pork into pillowy tortillas.
In December, Mortenson, tired of working 50 hours a week for low pay, quit his job as a cook at a vegetarian restaurant in Manhattan and became a full-time member of the gig economy. Now he races around New York, working shifts at a rotating cast of restaurants that use the hospitality staffing app Pared. So far, he has cooked in more than 70 kitchens, including Osteria Morini in Soho and Riverpark in Kips Bay.
“I have to turn the notifications off at night - I can’t sleep,” said Mortenson, 51, who has worked full time at restaurants in Las Vegas, San Francisco and Austin, Texas. “They send me so many jobs I can’t even look at my app right now without 10 jobs being on there.”
Gig workers are nothing new in the restaurant world. Every day, contractors on bikes and scooters deliver food for Uber Eats and DoorDash. But in a growing number of kitchens, contract workers now make the food, too.
With the restaurant industry facing its worst labor shortage in decades, Pared and a rival app, Instawork, are filling a growing void, as managers who have struggled to recruit permanent employees turn to on-demand services for workers trained as dishwashers, servers, line cooks and even oyster shuckers.
As the apps become more established, some workers are exchanging the stability of traditional hospitality jobs for the flexibility of temporary employment. Others are using the apps to make a quick buck on the side. The development has raised concerns among some labor advocates, who argue that the same pay and equity problems that have emerged in other parts of the gig economy, like ride-hailing and delivery, could come to the restaurant kitchen.

Texto completo: Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker will make a campaign stop in Portland this weekend.
The U.S. senator from New Jersey will host a fundraiser at 5 p.m. Saturday at Halo at the Point at Thompson's Point, his campaign announced Tuesday morning. The doors open at 4:30 p.m. It was described as a "grassroots fundraiser happy hour with Mainers."
The visit marks Booker's first campaign stop in the Pine Tree State and makes him the fourth Democrat vying for the party's nomination to appear here after U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, and author Marianne Williamson.
Booker was an early entry into the presidential race, announcing his campaign back in February. Booker is currently polling about 2 percent in the 20-candidate Democratic field, according to The New York Times. He is among the 10 candidates who have qualified for the third Democratic debate on Sept. 12, to be aired on ABC and Univision, the Times reports.

Mattis shows way on defiance

Texto completo: President Donald Trump has been destabilizing U.S. politics, and the country's position in international affairs, since he took office.
For the unelected but conscientious officials who serve under, and owe their legal duties to, the office of the president, the dilemma from Day One has been: What's a bureaucrat to do?
Bill Dudley, who until last year was president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, provided one sort of answer in a Tuesday opinion article for Bloomberg Opinion: He urged the Fed to defy Trump openly and hasten his political downfall.
Trump's tariffs on China (and others) threaten economic growth, but to counteract that by easing monetary policy, as the Fed has done, only enables the president to pursue his trade war, Dudley argued.
Therefore, the central bank must refuse to ease; if it reduces job, income and investment prospects for Americans, Trump, not the Fed, "will own the consequences of his actions." Not only was Dudley untroubled by the use of Fed power to undercut the president in an election year, but also he declared doing so consistent with the Fed's legal mandate.
"If the goal of monetary policy is to achieve the best long-term economic outcome," he wrote, "then Fed officials should consider how their decisions will affect the political outcome in 2020." Apparently, the Fed must destroy the U.S. economy - and its own political impartiality - to save them.
Economic policy experts, appropriately, recoiled. Former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said it "might be the least responsible statement by a former financial official in decades."
Dudley's proposal did, however, have one advantage: transparency and forthrightness. Compare the passive-aggressive resistance former FBI Director James Comey offered before, and just after, his firing by Trump in May 2017, described by the Justice Department inspector general in a highly critical report released Thursday.
In a fateful Feb. 14, 2017, private meeting, Trump sounded out Comey about dropping the investigation of former national security adviser Michael Flynn; this appalled the FBI chief, but he neither questioned the president at the meeting nor informed his superiors later nor resigned on principle.
He stayed on, sitting noncommittally through awkward meetings with Trump - and writing memos to the file. Then, when Trump fired him, Comey leaked a memo's contents to the New York Times via a friend, with the goal, subsequently realized, of triggering the appointment of a special counsel.
The ambiguous results of that investigation - like those of Comey's 2016 efforts to fine-tune public perceptions of the nonprosecution of Hillary Clinton for her email misadventure - have resulted in, well, a mixed legacy for Comey.
Admirers see him as making the best of a tight situation; the inspector general brands his policy-driven leak a "dangerous" bending of rules designed to keep the FBI strictly apolitical.
Whatever you think about that, Comey's rationale for leaking the way he did is puzzling. After his firing, he was free to hold a news conference accusing Trump of obstructing justice, as the inspector general acknowledged. Comey favored roundabout disclosure because speaking out would generate an unbearable news media scrum - "like feeding seagulls at the beach," as he put it.
The country and Comey would be better off if he had at least tried to go through channels first, then blown his whistle openly, damn the consequences. Which brings us to former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, and a third possible answer to the bureaucrat's dilemma: Limit the damage Trump does while you're in office, resign over policy disagreements when they get too wide - but refrain from overt, public condemnation of the commander in chief during or after your service.
Mattis stuck to that plan even as he rolled out his new book last week. An excerpt in the Wall Street Journal implied, not very obliquely, disgust with Trump's toxic management style and his failure to "kee[p] faith with our allies" - but never named the president.
Mattis never crossed the lines of hypocrisy, disloyalty or dishonesty. The downside of this assiduous reputation-preservation is that Mattis stands accused of lending "his honor and integrity to the Trump administration," as Jason Dempsey, a retired Army officer who has written extensively about civil-military relations, put it in an interview last week with the Washington Post. Then again, if Mattis did speak out more explicitly, even his words might eventually degenerate into so much grist for Twitter and cable television.
Even in far less dysfunctional administrations, it's hard for bureaucrats to balance career goals, public responsibility and personal integrity.
Maybe that is why the Constitution does not rely on the bureaucracy but on other institutions to check presidential excess: term limits, courts, Congress and, ultimately, elections. The people have already chastened Trump by ending his party's control of Congress in 2018 and might well oust him altogether next year.

Texto completo: John Lee, Hong Kong's secretary for security, warned the city of "elements of terror" as riot police prepared for more pro-democracy protests in the city.
"The extent of violence, danger and destruction have reached very serious conditions," Lee said according to the New York Times. "Radical people have escalated their violent and illegal acts, showing elements of terror."
Last month, a spokesperson for the Chinese office responsible for overseeing policy towards Hong Kong characterized protests as showing "signs of terrorism."
"Hong Kong’s radical demonstrators have repeatedly attacked police officers with extremely dangerous means," the spokesperson said. "These have already constituted serious violent crimes and have begun to show signs of terrorism."
At the time, Hong Kong authorities rejected the assertion that protesters were demonstrating elements of terrorism.
"We are not at that stage yet," Steve Li Kwai-wah, a senior police superintendent in Hong Kong, said.
Last week, Hong Kong police arrested pro-democracy leaders claiming they were part of an unlawful assembly ahead of the 13th consecutive weekend of protests.
Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam, speaking in English, said she would have quit if given the choice in audio published Monday by Reuters.
"If I have a choice the first thing is to quit, having made a deep apology," she said. Lam said, as she appeared to fight back tears, that her role in allowing the situation in Hong Kong to escalate was "unforgivable."
Photo Caption:Police and demonstrators clash during a protest in Hong Kong, Saturday. The protesters were part of a larger group marching to demand the removal of smart lampposts installed in a Kowloon district over fears they could contain high-tech cameras and facial recognition software used for surveillance by Chinese authorities.

Texto completo: Trump administration officials are at odds over whether to expand the CIA’s presence in Afghanistan if the United States begins decreasing its remaining forces in the country.
Senior White House officials want the intelligence agency to play a bigger role if there is a withdrawal, but officials from the CIA and the military disagree, the New York Times reported Monday.
Officials supportive of the plan, which would rely on CIA-supported militias, believe it could prevent the resurgence of terrorist groups. The militias have been used to fight terrorist and insurgent cells across the country throughout the nearly 18-year war.
CIA Director Gina Haspel has reportedly expressed her skepticism about the proposal to other administration officials, saying the agency depends on the military for airstrikes, surveillance, medical support, and bomb technicians.
Those opposed also believe it could strain current negotiations with the Taliban to end the longest war in U.S. history. The Taliban have demanded during peace talks that CIA officers leave the country along with international military forces.
About 14,000 U.S. troops remain in the country, training Afghan troops and for counterterrorism measures.

Texto completo: A commercial dive boat with 39 passengers and crew members aboard was engulfed in flames early Monday and sunk hours later near the Santa Cruz Island shoreline off the Ventura County coast. By late Monday, authorities confirmed that 25 people died in the ordeal, with several others still unaccounted for, the Associated Press reported.
FIve of the boat’s six crew members were rescued.
By midday Monday, authorities had confirmed that four victims were found dead near the 75-foot vessel Conception, which departed Saturday from Santa Barbara Harbor for a Labor Day holiday weekend excursion. Later in the day, crews discovered four more bodies on the ocean floor near the wreckage of the vessel, Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said.
The AP reported that, by late Monday, the Coast Guard had confirmed that at least 25 people had died.
Torrance resident says ‘divine intervention’ kept him off deadly dive boat
What sparked the horrific fire, which was first reported to the Coast Guard via a frantic mayday call around 3:30 a.m., wasn’t immediately known.
“Our hearts go out to the families of the victims of this terrible tragedy,” Brown said at a somber news conference. “We understand the tremendous burden they are under right now as they wait to determine exactly what happened. We will be working diligently to get them as much information as possible as soon as possible.”
Authorities were continuing to search into the evening for more of the 33 passengers unaccounted for after flames tore through boat. The Conception also carried six crew members, five of whom were rescued after fleeing the burning craft, officials said.
“We will continue to search but we should be prepared for the worst outcome,” U.S. Coast Guard Capt. Monica Rochester said.
Firefighters responded to the blaze shortly before 3:30 a.m., about 90 miles from Los Angeles. Coast Guard Sector Los Angeles-Long Beach overheard a mayday call about 15 minutes earlier of a commercial vessel with 39 people aboard.
By the time crews arrived shortly after the mayday call, the boat was fully engulfed in flames with little anyone could do to save it, said Mark Hartwig, Santa Barbara County’s fire chief.
Crews from the Coast Guard, Santa Barbara Fire Department, Ventura County Fire Department and Vessel Assist responded. The fire crews were fighting the blaze when the vessel sank 20 yards off shore in 64 feet of water, officials said.
Authorities said that initial four recovered bodies had injuries consistent with drowning, according to The Associated Press.
Five of the boat’s crew members were rescued by a nearby boat.
“The crew was actually already awake and on the bridge and they jumped off,” Rochester told reporters at a news conference at the Channel Islands Harbor.
They were evacuated on to a good Samaritan’s boat, Grape Escape, the Coast Guard said. Two of the crew members had minor injuries, said Coast Guard Petty Officer Mark Barney.
“When we looked out, the other boat was totally engulfed in flames, from stem to stern,” Grape Escape owner Bob Hansen told The New York Times. “I could see the fire coming through holes on the side of the boat. There were these explosions every few beats. You can’t prepare yourself for that. It was horrendous.”
As the morning turned to afternoon, family members of the missing passengers trickled in to the Coast Guard station in Oxnard in search of answers.
Sheriff Brown told reporters that the passengers would have be identified through DNA, depending on the condition of their remains.
A woman who came to the harbor early Monday said, “My son was on that boat.” She was led away by a Ventura County firefighter.
At around 8:30 a.m. the vessel had a portion of the bow sticking out of the water, authorities said.
Rochester said that the missing passengers were sleeping below deck at the time of the fire. She said authorities were working with the owners of the boat which had been in “full compliance” prior to its trip departure.
Rochester said rescuers would continue searching through the night.
“This isn’t a day that we wanted to wake up to,” she said at the afternoon news conference.
Several photos on social media posted by the fire agencies showed the Santa Barbara Harbor-based vessel completely overtaken by flames.
According to the Worldwide Diving Adventures website, the boat was on its last day of a three-day diving excursion that started in Santa Barbara Harbor. The Labor Day weekend trip, which started Aug. 31, gave passengers the opportunity to see marine life and explore San Miguel Island, according to the website.
The Conception had departed at 4 a.m. Saturday with plans to return Monday.
The boat was launched in 1981 and had a 46-person capacity, according to its profile on the website of Truth Aquatics, the Santa Barbara company that owns the ship. It had rafts and life jackets for 110 passengers and a fixed CO2 engine room for fire suppression.
Divers sleep in a single room of bunk beds, according to a diagram of the Conception posted on the website.
Thomas Kruger, director of scuba operations at Dive N’ Surf in Redondo Beach, said the boat and the operator had a good reputation.
Dive N’ Surf has booked charters on the Conception and other dive boats operated by Truth Aquatics, but not for at least a year mainly because of the distance, he said.
“This has been way out of left field,” Kruger said in an interview Monday. “The boat has been a phenomenally good boat that was meticulously kept. There was nothing anytime they were diving that would have indicated an event like this.”
Dive boats of that size are typically inspected by the U.S. Coast Guard about once per year, Kruger said. Operators also generally perform regular checks of fire extinguishers and other safety devices whenever the boat goes out, he said.
“Having a boat of that caliber there is a lot that goes into maintaining those boats and the systems on them,” Kruger said.
The event had a major effect on the close-knit diving community. Calls have been coming in inquiring whether anyone local was on board, Kruger said. As of Monday afternoon, the identities of the victims had not been released and Kruger did not know if any local divers were on board.
“We are sending out our prayers and our hopes that we get some better news by the end of the day,” he said.
Dale Sheckler, a Torrance man who is an experienced diver, had planned on spending Labor Day weekend aboard the Conception, but a hip surgery sidelined those plans.
“I feel frightened and relieved at the same time,” Sheckler said. “I’m also sick about the lives that were lost. I’m upset about it. My heart goes out to them.”
Sheckler said he’s been on the Conception several times before, but hasn’t been on the vessel in well over a year.
“I think considering the fact that the crew lost one of their members, I think that people need to understand that the crew was probably unable to assist those in distress,” he said.
Members of the diving community also expressed their grief on social media. Many shared their thoughts on the Truth Aquatics Facebook page, some recounting their own diving experiences.

Others showed photos of the vessel’s sleeping area, pondering if passengers could have escaped.
Most, like Kruger, offered their condolences and prayers.
Sprinkled into the comments were those who questioned why members of the crew may have been the only ones to survive. That sentiment was addressed by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who Monday afternoon called for an “immediate and robust” investigation.
“It’s inconceivable that with all the safety regulations we have in place today, a fire on a boat can lead to the loss of life we saw this morning near Santa Cruz Island,” Feinstein said in a statement.
“We must know what fire-suppression systems and other emergency equipment are in place on these boats and whether they were in working order on the Conception. And we need to understand exactly how the crew was trained and, if they were awake and above-deck, why they were unable to alert or help rescue passengers.”
The Channel Islands National Park Service said that the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Department, Santa Barbara County Fire Department, United States Coast Guard are working with it as a unified command.
A one-mile safety zone was established around the perimeter of the incident while search-and-rescue efforts continue, officials said. A 3,000-foot flight restriction was also temporarily placed around the ship.
Authorities have established a Family Assistance Center at the Earl Warren Showgrounds, 3400 Calle Real, Santa Barbara, which is expected to remain open through Thursday. Information via phone is available from the Santa Barbara County Office of Emergency Management at 833-688-5551.

Texto completo: ODESSA, Texas –
The gunman who killed seven people and left 25 others injured on Saturday was fired from his job that morning and was "on a long spiral down. "
Odessa Police Chief Michael Gerke said at Monday news conference Seth Aaron Ator, 36, and his employer at Journey Oilfield Services both called 911 Saturday to complain about the other over the firing.
The shooter made a "rambling statement," but no threats were made.
“Can’t speak to his motives or why he called,” Gerke said, noting such calls to police are routine.
Ator left the business before officers arrived and then called the FBI's tipline. In that call he also made no threats of violence, Gerke noted.
The Texas Department of Public Safety trooper who pulled him over for a routraffic stop was unaware of the morning incidents that preceded the shooting spree.
FBI Special Agent Christopher Combs said the shooter's home was "a very strange residence" that reflected his mental state.
“He was on a long spiral of going down," Combs said, after a search of the property west of Odessa. "He didn’t wake up Saturday morning and go into his company and then it happened. He went to that company in trouble and had probably been in trouble for a while. ”
Gerke said it was unknown how he came to have the firearm. Federal and state agencies were “aggressively investigating” how he acquired it.
Online court records show he was arrested in 2001 for a misdemeanor offense that would not have prevented him from legally purchasing firearms in Texas, although authorities have not said where he got the "AR style" weapon he used.
The shooting began with a routine traffic stop for failing to signal. The gunman opened fire on a pair of troopers through the rear-view window, wounding one. He then took off in a gold-colored car, shooting randomly for more than 10 miles, firing at motorists and pedestrians before hijacking a U. S. Postal Service truck.
The shooter was killed after being chased by officers from neighboring cities Midland and Odessa. Police used a marked SUV to ram the mail truck outside the Cinergy Movie Theater in Odessa, disabling the vehicle. The gunman then fired at police, wounding two officers before he was killed.
"Local law enforcement and state troopers pursued him and stopped him from possibly going into a crowded movie theater and having another event of mass violence," Agent Combs said.
He was later identified in a Facebook post by the Odessa Police Department. Police say investigators were still searching for motives for the shooting.
Madison Tate, spokeswoman for the Odessa Regional Medical Center, which initially received six shooting victims, said Monday afternoon that two people remain hospitalized “and are showing signs of improvement. ” Four were discharged Saturday.
One victim remains in critical condition, Tate said, but is stable and showing signs of improvement. Tate said the other victim has improved and is no longer in intensive care.
Hundreds of people gathered at Odessa’s University of Texas-Permian Basin in the Permian on Sunday evening for a prayer vigil.
“We are devastated by this idiot who hurt our communities,” Midland Mayor Jerry Morales said at the vigil. “But we are one, we are strong together. This idiot will not break our faith. ”

Here's what we know now: 7 dead, 22 injured in Odessa, Texas, shooting
More: Visitors at El Paso memorial ask how many more have to die after latest Texas shooting
.
The shooting came at the end of an already violent month in Texas; on Aug. 3, a gunman in the border city of El Paso killed 22 people at a Walmart. Sitting beside authorities in Odessa, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott ticked off a list of mass shootings that have now killed nearly 70 people since 2016 in his state alone.
"I have been to too many of these events," Abbott said. "Too many Texans are in mourning. Too many Texans have lost their lives. The status quo in Texas is unacceptable, and action is needed. "
Abbott, a Republican, was noncommittal about imposing any new gun laws in Texas at a time when Democrats and gun-control groups are demanding restrictions. And even as Abbott spoke, a number of looser gun laws he signed this year took effect on the first day of September, including one that would arm more teachers in Texas schools.

Texto completo: South Korea
N. Korea says hope for talks grows slim
SEOUL — North Korea said Saturday that its expectations for more dialogue with the Trump administration were “gradually disappearing" and threatened to reconsider its conciliatory gestures toward the United States, potentially including its moratorium on nuclear and long-range missile tests. The warning was contained in a statement issued by First Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui, which accused Secretary of State Mike Pompeo of blocking efforts to restart dialogue. Choe was the second senior North Korean official in a week to attack Pompeo, this time over a speech Tuesday in which he said the administration had “recognized North Korea's rogue behavior could not be ignored." That remark made the opening of “working-level negotiations more difficult," Choe said. “Our expectations of dialogue with the U.S. are gradually disappearing, and we are being pushed to reexamine all the measures we have taken so far." (New York Times)
Yemen
Sweden seeks to reopen dialogue
SANAA — Sweden's foreign minister said Friday she was heading to the Middle East in an attempt to relaunch talks between Yemen's internationally recognized government and the country's Iran-backed Houthi rebels. Margot Wallstrom told Swedish Radio that she wants to "speak with as many people as possible," adding she will visit Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, and Jordan, and planned to meet officials from the United Nations. Wallstrom admitted a deal signed in December was "fragile." In December, both sides signed a UN-brokered peace deal in Stockholm under mounting international pressure to alleviate the world's worst humanitarian crisis. But while the two sides agreed to the redeployment of forces from the Red Sea port city of Hodeida, they have been divided over who will run the main entry point for humanitarian aid to the country once they pull out.

France
Man held in fatal stabbing at subway
VILLEURBANNE — Police detained an Afghan man seeking asylum in France after one person was fatally stabbed and nine others injured Saturday outside a subway station near the city of Lyon, authorities said. The reason for the attack was unclear. The assailant was a 33-year-old Afghan citizen who had applied for asylum in France and was awaiting a response, according to a national police official. The attacker provided contradictory information to police, but that the attack did not appear to be terrorism-related, two French officials said. The victim who died was a 19-year-old man, and it was unclear if he knew the attacker, according to local police. Three of the injured are in critical condition, officials said. (AP)

The frauding of America's farmers

Texto completo: Donald Trump is unpopular, but he retains the loyalty of some important groups. Among the most loyal are America's farmers, who are a tiny minority of the population but exert disproportionate political influence because of our electoral system, which gives 3.2 million Iowans as many senators as almost 40 million Californians. According to one recent poll, 71% of farmers approve of Trump's performance - which is down somewhat from previous polling, but remains far above the national average.
Yet farmers are hurting financially. Investors are worried about a possible recession for the economy as a whole, but the farm recession is already here, with falling incomes, rising delinquency rates and surging bankruptcies. And the farm economy's troubles stem directly from Trump's policies.
This apparent contradiction - Trump is inflicting the greatest harm on the people who supported him most - isn't an accident.But farmers' financial distress should also have been predictable: While rural America may dislike and distrust cosmopolitan elites, the U.S. farm economy is hugely dependent on global markets, and it has inevitably been a major victim of the Trumpian trade war.
The questions, looking forward, are whether farmers understood what they were getting themselves into, whether they understand even now that their distress isn't likely to end anytime soon, and whether economic pain will shake their support for the man who's causing it.
At one level, it's not hard to see why farmers supported Trump. Hostility to nonwhite immigrants was central to his campaign, and such hostility tends to be highest in places where there aren't actually many immigrants. So rural America, with its still tiny immigrant population, was a receptive audience for his fear-mongering.
On the other hand, while farm country may be notably lacking in ethnic diversity and feels generally distrustful of globalists, the farm economy is in fact deeply integrated with and dependent on world markets. On the eve of Trump's trade war, America exported 76% of its cotton production, 55% of its sorghum, half its soybeans, and 46% of its wheat.
Overall, U.S. agricultural exports are almost 40% of the value of farm production, up from just 15% circa 1970. Globalization hurt some parts of U.S. manufacturing, with particularly harsh effects on some small industrial cities. But the rise of China and the growth of world trade have been nothing but good news for farmers.
And here's the thing: It shouldn't have been hard to predict that Trumponomics would be bad for farmers. Trump's desire for a trade war was out in the open from the beginning. And a trade war was bound to hurt farm exports. Did anyone really imagine that China, an economic superpower with its own fierce nationalism, wouldn't retaliate against U.S. tariffs?
So what were farmers thinking? My guess is that they let the will to believe override their judgment. Trump seemed like their kind of guy. He certainly seemed to share their dislike for urban elites who, they imagined, looked down on people like them. So they convinced themselves that he knew what he was doing, that he would win his trade war and that they would be among the victors sharing the spoils.
Even now many farmers seem to believe that the pain will end any day now, that Trump will soon announce a deal that restores all the old markets and more.
In short, farmers' support for Trump should be seen as a form of affinity fraud, in which people fall for a con man whom they imagine to be someone like them.
And as is often the case in such frauds, the con man and his associates actually have contempt for their marks.
Recently Sonny Perdue, the agriculture secretary, let the mask slip during a meeting with farmers complaining about their plight. "What do you call two farmers in a basement?" he snarked. "A whine cellar."
Trump's own remarks about trade with Japan were even more telling. According to a White House transcript, Trump complained that while Japan sends us millions of cars, "We send them wheat. Wheat. (Laughter.)" Do farmers realize that their president considers their livelihood a joke?
So what will happen as the trade war drags on? Don't expect farmers to suddenly exclaim en masse, "Hey, we've been had!" Real life doesn't work that way. But they have, in fact, been had, and they may finally be starting to realize it.

Apparently the bedbugs truly do bite

Texto completo: A columnist for the New York Times got all upset last week because a reader called him a "bedbug" on Twitter.
The guy who called the columnist a bedbug is a professor at George Washington University named David Karpf. The columnist, Bret Stephens, actually contacted the university provost to let him know what the professor said.
He also contacted the professor, saying, "I'm often amazed about the things supposedly decent people are prepared to say about other people — people they've never met — on Twitter. I think you set a new standard."
I'm ... stunned.
I do not know Bret Stephens of the New York Times, but I am familiar with the experience of being a newspaper columnist, and of what one should expect on social media, including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, blogs, the newspaper's website and more.
The very first thing a person venturing into the shark-infested waters of the internet learns is that the various platforms of cyberspace should not be called the social media, but the anti-social media.
For example, on the day I read the story about the columnist Stephens I received a note from a reader named Donald C. who wrote:
"You ignorant liberal piece of cr**, Takes a lot of ovaries, we all know you have no b****, to compare President Trump to Arpaio. Why don't you compare the Kenyan or the Clintons to Arpaio, they're the a******* still running their mouths. As usual, your writing sucks."
This is not the most animated missive I have ever received.
It wasn't even the most colorful response I received that day.
So, I find it odd that columnist Stephens would suggest that being called a "bedbug" by Professor Karph "set a new standard."
I also cannot believe that columnist Stephens would be "amazed about the things supposedly decent people are prepared to say about other people — people they've never met."
Just look at what the president of the United States has said on Twitter about people he's never met.
And contacting the guy's boss?
Come on.
The columnist Stephens called Twitter a "sewer" and deactivated his account.
This doesn't mean he is leaving the electronic neighborhood where those of us in the media reside, not as long as he continues to publish in the New York Times. It only means that he's keeping his door locked and not answering his phone. It's a kind of denial. Those of us in the media have made our virtual beds and now must lie in them, where the bedbugs bite.
So, unlike columnist Stephens, I have no interest in contacting the employer of Mr. Donald C. in order to point out his unimaginative, ungrammatical, racist, ignorant screed.
When I post something online I know the virtual room I'm entering is not a solemn lecture hall at an Ivy League university. It is a bullet-ridden speakeasy or brothel or gambling hall — or all of the above — in a part of town where no cabbie or Uber driver will pick you up or drop you off.
And I am sitting next to Donald C. at the bar.

Texto completo: The idea that the preservation of slavery was the key reason American colonists declared independence from Britain - a theory put forth in a New York Times report on the 400th anniversary of the first importation of slaves to America - is demonstrably false ["A revisionist narrative of slavery," Opinion, Aug. 20].
Thomas Jefferson's early draft of the Declaration of Independence condemned slavery. His original text stated that King George III "has waged cruel war against human nature itself, violating its most sacred rights of life and liberty in the persons of a distant people who never offended him, captivating & carrying them into slavery in another hemisphere or to incur miserable death in their transportation thither."
Jefferson, who himself owned slaves, later said this passage was removed in order to secure votes of Georgia, and North and South Carolina for unanimous passage of the Declaration. These colonies would have remained in allegiance to Britain if independence meant the end of slavery.
America had a chance to end slavery at the inception of the country. We have struggled throughout our existence with slavery and its legacy. More than 600,000 Americans died fighting over slavery in our Civil War. We are still fighting over slavery and its effects. We cannot finally heal those effects with falsehoods.

Texto completo: Sure, putting a man on the moon was a pretty big deal 50 summers ago.
Then there are some who considered the arrival of the Baseball Encyclopedia a short time later to be out of this world.
Of all the mind-blowing events from the summer of 1969, the wondrous thud of this 2,337-page bound publication, weighing more than six pounds and mass produced by computer software on onion-skin-thin paper, was as revelatory as it was roomy.

For the first time, the public had up-to-date and accurate access to the complete statistics of more than 10,000 professional baseball players going back to 1876. Think beyond the back-of-bubble-gum-card material.
The expanded columns had 17 stats for hitters and 19 for pitchers. It mined the archives of newspapers, scoresheets and loose-leaf binders collecting dust at the Baseball Hall of Fame to confirm and even recalculate categories such as runs batted in, which were not recorded before 1920, and earned runs charged to pitchers, which weren't computed until 1911.
Writer Jimmy Breslin wrote in the New York Times: "The book figures to be of untold value to bartenders who have to settle arguments with customers."
The legacy of that first book, still available in second-hand stores and online retailers for those with a sentimental heart, adds up to something modern-day sabermetricians will gladly calculate.
The first Major League Baseball-endorsed book of historical accuracy was not just a must-have for public libraries, team record-keepers and newspaper sports reference desks; it kick-started the creation of the Society for American Baseball Research in 1970.
The proliferation of personal computers and an enthusiastic thirst for new ways to interpret information begat destinations such as Retrosheet.org, which logged the game's history of box scores and play by play, and Baseball-Reference.com, which formatted those stats and further interpreted the information. Both websites are run by volunteers. The result of their work is free.
Just before the book's release Sept. 10, 1969, then-commissioner Bowie Kuhn hosted a news conference in a New York restaurant, trying to explain why this was a significant, collaborative achievement.
David Neft, the book's first-edition editor in chief, says he's over the moon to be here today at age 82 and witness the marking of this milestone.
"I realized two things from the start -- one, I better damn well get it right, and two, whatever else I did professionally in my life, I figured that 50 years later, when I'm dead and buried, if anyone remembers me for anything, it'll be for this book," said Neft, who holds a doctorate in statistics and was the director of research for Information Concepts, the company hired for this undertaking.
At the annual SABR convention in June in San Diego, a panel discussion formed to herald the Baseball Encyclopedia's golden anniversary and provide context. Neft flew in from New York to join Retrosheet.org founder David Smith, based in Delaware, and Baseball-Reference.com President Sean Forman, who lives in Philadelphia.
MLB official historian John Thorn, who moderated the event, said Retrosheet.org, founded in 1989, has so far digitized the play by play and box scores of nearly 175,000 games -- 98% of all played over the last century.
Baseball-Reference.com, launched in 2000 and expanded to basketball, the NFL, hockey, college football and soccer, says its primary aim is to be the "easiest to use, fastest and most complete sports statistics [site] anywhere. If we have some fun in the process, that's good too."
"You are all descendants of the Baseball Encyclopedia, and we all owe David our deep appreciation and applause on this 50th anniversary," Thorn told the gathering. "All of us on this stage stand, in our past and our continuing work, on the shoulders of the Baseball Encyclopedia and its principal architect."
Smith even brought along the copy given to him in 1969 with the inscription: "To David: This should answer some questions you hadn't even thought of. Mother and Dad."
The book's original price tag was $25.
Neft says the project "had very little to do with baseball and all to do with technology," becoming the first book published in the United States with any kind of computer software. IBM used a processor originally designed to print regional editions of TV Guide. Macmillan Publishing became involved because it had experience publishing the Donnelly phone book.
"There was no way to have someone on a linotype machine input six-point type on more than 2,000 pages and then have someone proofread every number," said Neft, a recipient of the first SABR Henry Chadwick Award for lifetime work and included on the 2016 list by the Sporting News of the 40 most influential people in MLB history.
Neft edited only the first book, which was updated 10 times by Macmillan and known internally as the "Big Mac" before it ceased in 1993. Thorn and several other partners used its template to launch a half dozen editions of "Total Baseball" as the official MLB encyclopedia from 1989 through 2004.
Eventually, the Baseball Encyclopedia went the way of the Thomas Guide, which yielded to technological advancements in navigation.
If the internet killed the Baseball Encyclopedia, the brand remained loyal among its users.
Jon Leonoudakis, a baseball documentarian from the San Fernando Valley who grew up in San Francisco, was 11 when his parents gave him the first Baseball Encyclopedia in 1969.
"Growing up Catholic, the biggest book I'd seen to that point was the Bible, so I realized this had to be an amazing document," Leonoudakis said at the SABR convention. "I was so engrossed in it, it lived in the bathroom for a while.
"As a baseball historian, this book has been incredibly vital to have. It's just that as you kept buying the updated issues, you could never really keep them all in your house because you'd need a bookcase the size of Mars."
Neft remains most proud of the fact his work eventually helped Hall of Fame voters comprehend the impact of someone such as pitcher Addie Joss (1902-10, elected in 1978 with a 1.89 ERA, second lowest of all time) and outfielder Sam Thompson (1885-1906 -- inactive from 1899 to 1905 -- elected in 1974 with 1,308 RBIs in 1,410 games over 15 seasons).
"For so long, there was a lack of information that could help define their accomplishments," Neft said. "This fueled an appetite for people getting involved on their own, like SABR, but also working with like-minded colleagues to mine new information, discuss its importance and open it up to everyone."
For the record, it was likely the first time many stumbled across a player such as Archibald "Moonlight" Graham, who played one game with the 1905 New York Giants. He's on Page 902 of the first edition, and he inspired the Burt Lancaster character in the 1989 movie "Field of Dreams."
Neft smiles when reflecting on how his team of about 30 researchers worked with Hall of Fame curator Lee Allen, a vital contributor who died just before the book was published.
"The analogy I think of, since we're talking baseball, was that it felt like I was the manager of a World Series champion," Neft said. "I had people of all different backgrounds and beliefs, all working together for the common goal of making this work. It was a wonderful experience."

During his 1972 presidential race, Maine’s Edmund Muskie faced at least three death threats

Texto completo: Federal Bureau of Investigation records released Friday show that three times in early 1972 federal investigators probed threats to kill U.S. Sen. Edmund Muskie of Maine, at the time a leading contender within the Democratic Party for president.
It doesn’t appear from the 1,038 pages of material released to the Sun Journal that the FBI ever tracked down two of the culprits. Federal prosecutors opted not to charge the other, a mentally ill man quickly found by agents.
<img class="wp-image-9074703" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/08/Muskie-Time.jpg" alt="" width="246" height="326" />
The information, sought via a Freedom of Information request for anything in FBI files related to Muskie, contained little about the former senator himself. Muskie was a former Maine governor, Democratic vice presidential candidate in 1968 and U.S. secretary of state during the final year of President Jimmy Carter’s administration.
One memorandum shows that Carter notified the FBI on April 30, 1980, that he intended to nominate Muskie to replace his current secretary of state, Cyrus Vance. Field offices were told to expedite efforts to probe the Rumford, Maine, native’s background.
Agents quickly fanned out to talk with friends and family members and look at Muskie’s military records from World War II, among other things.
The memo to agents said that Muskie “will be required to make decisions concerning policy and personnel matters; therefore, during interviews, determine if appointee has expressed or manifested any bias or prejudice against any class of citizen, or any religious, racial or ethnic group. Also determine if appointee uses illegal drugs or abuses alcohol.”
Only one negative thing turned up, records show: On Dec. 28, 1965, in the tiny town of Centreville on Maryland’s Eastern Shore, Muskie was issued a criminal summons at Broadwater Farms for “attempting to take migratory water fowl with the aid of bait.”
Muskie paid the $25 fine and $2.50 administrative charge before having a guilty verdict entered on the charge in 1966. It was the only charge against Muskie that investigators unearthed and didn’t have any impact on his appointment.
Muskie was confirmed for the diplomatic post by a vote of 96-2 in the U.S. Senate on May 8, 1980.
Muskie had long been in the public eye by then, especially from the time he ran unsuccessfully for vice president in 1968 through his failed presidential bid in 1972, a period when he pushed through both the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act.
That national attention no doubt played a role in the decision by an unknown letter writer in Bryantown, Maryland, to include him among four prominent Democrats who would allegedly be blown to bits in their Capitol Hill offices on May 4, 1972.
Bomb threats were taken seriously even in those less security-conscious days. A major blast in 1971 in the Capitol had caused serious damage, though no injuries.
Handwritten letters were dropped into a post office box addressed to Muskie and fellow U.S. Sens. George McGovern of South Dakota and Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts. The notes to each said they were slated to die along with U.S. House Speaker Carl Albert.
<img class="wp-image-9074807 size-full" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/08/Letter-to-Muskie-re-bomb-1972.jpg" alt="" width="515" height="475" />
The letter to Muskie, opened the morning of May 4 in his office, told him the men would be killed “in your own offices.”
“The bomb is supposed to be dynamite, with a contact fuse,” the writer claimed in the note to Muskie. “It is pre-planned & the bomb is to be placed under chairs.”
“We hope this is not going to happen, but we really hope you will check,” the letter said, claiming it had been dictated by the Ouija Board.
The FBI managed to pull a couple of fingerprints off the envelope but could not match them with anyone. There is no indication in the file that agents ever found who sent the letters, who may have also sent threatening notes months earlier to Kennedy, President Richard Nixon, The New York Times and The Boston Globe.
In January 1972, letters signed by a G.C. Carlton in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, told Muskie, Kennedy and U.S. Sen. Edward Brooks of Massachusetts they should be shot.
In the note to Muskie, the writer said, after offering an uncharitable view of the senator’s wife, that the lawmaker “should be deported to Poland or Rome.”
<img class="wp-image-9074827" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/08/Muskie-envelope-2.jpg" alt="" width="249" height="141" />
“Somebody should fill you and the bastard harp Kennedy full of lead,” the letter read before it turned even more profane, ending with the insistence that both Kennedy and Muskie should “rot in hell.”
The FBI managed to find a few aliases from the same writer — his language was a dead giveaway — but appears to have had no success in determining his real identity.
The investigation ceased after an assistant U.S. attorney in Philadelphia ruled on Feb. 24, 1972, that the letter to Muskie “does not constitute a threat within the meaning and intent” of the relevant federal statute.
That same month, a caller who phoned a number of media outlets, including United Press International in the wee hours of the morning, claimed both Muskie and Alabama Gov. George Wallace had been targeted by something called the Black Underground Military for Justice, a group that authorities knew nothing about.
Agents soon tracked him down, discovering he was someone they’d spoken with before who had a mental illness and had provided useless information in other incidents. In person, he admitted he made it all up so the matter was dropped.
Muskie died in 1996 at the age of 81.

The truth about James Comey

Texto completo: On Jan. 28, 2017, a day after having dinner with President Trump at the White House, James Comey wrote a memo recording his recollection of the evening and the conversation.
“I felt comfortable throughout,” he wrote, “although never relaxed, given the focus the conversation required.”
Comey noted that the president had asked him, “So what do you want to do?” in the context of a discussion of whether the then-FBI director would stay in that job or move on.
“I responded by saying that he could fire me any time he wished, but that I wanted to stay,” Comey wrote. “I added that I was ‘reliable’ in one way but not in the way political people sometimes use the term. I explained that he could count on me to always tell him the truth. I said I don’t do sneaky things, I don’t leak, I don’t do weasel moves.”
Then the president asked “whether the FBI leaks.” Comey wrote that he told Trump the whole government leaks like crazy, and “he replied that he needed loyalty and expected loyalty.”
If that phrase sounds familiar, it may be because it was one of the leaks that was splashed all over newspaper front pages and TV news shows from Comey’s memos of his conversations with Trump, which he had secretly stored in his personal safe at his home and retrieved after the FBI locked him out of his office a few months later, on the day the president fired him.
It might have saved the country a lot of time and stress if Comey had leaked the quotation that the president “could fire me any time he wished.” But that might have inhibited calls for an investigation into potential obstruction of justice.
That’s not what Comey wanted. He wanted a special counsel to investigate the president.
According to the new report from the Justice Department’s Office of Inspector General, Comey improperly stashed private copies of four of seven memos he wrote to document his official meetings with Trump. One of them memorialized the conversation in a one-on-one meeting on February 14, 2017, in which Trump had said he hoped Comey could “see [his] way clear … to letting [Michael] Flynn go.”
Days after he was fired on May 9, 2017, Comey texted photos of “Memo 4” to his personal attorney and friend, Daniel Richman, with specific instructions to share the contents, but not the document, with a New York Times reporter.
The newspaper ran the story the same day under the headline, “Comey memo says Trump asked him to end Flynn investigation.” It related all the details that Comey had noted about the Oval Office meeting, including the notation about “letting Flynn go.”
The inspector general’s report says Comey did not mark Memo 4 as classified, even though Flynn was the subject of a non-public FBI investigation at the time. Instead, he gave one copy to his chief of staff to keep at the FBI and he secretly kept a copy in his personal safe at home.
We didn’t need the IG report to know why Comey arranged the leak. He told us himself, in testimony before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in June 2017 that he did it to “prompt the appointment of a special counsel.” He said he was concerned that Trump might destroy tapes of their conversations: “My judgment was, I need to get that out into the public square. I asked a friend of mine to share the content of the memo with a reporter.”
The inspector general thought that explanation was unacceptable. “Comey had several other lawful options available to him to advocate for the appointment of a special counsel, which he told us was his goal in making the disclosure,” the IG wrote. “What was not permitted was the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive investigative information, obtained during the course of FBI employment, in order to achieve a personally desired outcome.”
What was the outcome that Comey personally desired? Was it really the appointment of a special counsel in order to force the preservation of supposed tapes in the White House? Or did he reveal his true goal with his own words?
In the same testimony before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in June 2017, Comey was asked by Sen. John Cornyn about the Hillary Clinton email investigation and former President Bill Clinton’s tarmac meeting with Attorney General Loretta Lynch just as the investigation was wrapping up.
“After former President Clinton met on the plane with the attorney general, I considered whether I should call for the appointment of a special counsel and decided that would be an unfair thing to do because I knew there was no case there,” Comey testified, speaking of the Clinton email investigation. “And calling for the appointment of a special counsel would be brutally unfair because it would send the message, ‘Uh-huh, there’s something here.’ ”
Cornyn asked, “If a special counsel had been appointed, they could have made that determination there was nothing there and declined to pursue it, right?”
“Sure,” Comey answered, “but it would have been many months later or a year later.”
If that isn’t enough to prove that Comey intended and knowingly acted to smear the president with an endless investigation based on no wrongdoing, consider Comey’s notes from the Jan. 27 dinner meeting, the one in which he said he doesn’t do sneaky things, doesn’t leak, doesn’t do weasel moves.
Comey wrote that Trump said the salacious story about prostitutes in a Russian hotel was “a complete fabrication and ‘fake news,’” and the president “said he thought maybe he should ask me to investigate the whole thing to prove it was a lie.”
“I replied that it was up to him,” Comey wrote, “but I wouldn’t want to create a narrative that we were investigating him, because we are not and I worried such a thing would be misconstrued. I also said that it is very difficult to disprove a lie.”
It sure is. It’s even more difficult when the liar hides behind the fine reputation of federal law enforcement agents, people who did their greatest work for the country on the day they locked James Comey out of the building.

Texto completo: Una mujer lanzó este viernes un cóctel molotov en la recepción de una oficina del Servicio de Inmigración y Aduanas (USCIS, por sus siglas en inglés) de Oakland Park, Florida . La bomba casera no funcionó y el incidente quedó en un susto y sin heridos, según Associated Press.
De acuerdo al informe que consultó la citada agencia de noticias, la mujer entró con una botella llena de gasolina y una mecha encendida . Sin embargo, al lanzarla la mecha se soltó y la botella no se encendió.
El personal de seguridad de la oficina esposó a la autora y la detuvo hasta que llegó el Servicio de Protección Federal y la arrestaron.
Las autoridades policiales dijeron que este ataque no está relacionado con otros perpetrados también contra agencias del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional (DHS). No obstante, no dijeron el nombre de la mujer ni qué la habría movido a enfrentarse a la institución.
The New York Times informó hace dos semanas de una investigación en proceso sobre unos disparos en una oficina texana del Servicio de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas (ICE).
Estos ataques llegan en un momento de máxima tensión respecto a las restrictivas políticas migratorias que está proponiendo y empleando el presidente Donald Trump.
USCIS en concreto ha estado en el punto de mira en los últimos tiempos porque su director interino Ken Cuccinelli es partidario de las estrictas medidas migratorias del presidente. Bajo su supervisión, USCIS ha encabezado modificaciones como negar tarjetas de residencia a inmigrantes que hayan solicitado beneficios como Medicaid.

Texto completo: Garden Q&A

I am more than just a little frustrated with my garden. I take good care of it. Sometimes I am proud of it, and then I go out a week later and holes have been eaten in leaves of plants.

Gardening is supposed to be enjoyable, both in growing the plants and in appreciating the fruits (or flowers) of your hard work. Let's talk basic gardening for a moment. I notice you used the phrase "a week later" to discover damage. Here is a basic gardening truth; you must be very familiar with what is going on among your plant children. A leaf roller can devastate a canna lily in almost no time.

A weekly inspection just isn't enough in this buggy time of the year. Depending on the size of your garden, inspecting it daily or every other day is a good practice. You would be amazed how much damage aphids or cucumber beetles can do in a short time.

So, the gardening rule of thumb is to check as often as possible. Catch these critters early to keep your plants beautiful and your vegetables insect-free. When you make your visits to the garden, be sure to look at the underside of leaves as well as the top. See https://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/vh036 for a good review of the enemies waiting to attack your garden.

There are many other considerations needed to produce a healthy garden. The amount of sunlight has to be right for the plants you are growing. The soil needs to be amended with nutrients and other lighter ingredients such as peat moss or vermiculite to lighten the hard-packed soil before planting. You should start with a soil test to determine the pH of your soil. Just take in a soil sample that can be analyzed for free at your county extension service. To learn how to take the sample go to: https://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/ss494.

I am new to Jacksonville and an avid vegetable gardener. I was surprised to find that there are two gardening seasons here. Could you explain that?

The two-season gardening plan in North Florida is essentially caused by our extremely hot summers, when vegetables and many other plants do not do well. So, the first season for vegetable gardening is late winter into spring. The second season is fall through early winter. Please see the Florida Vegetable Gardening Guide (http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/vh021) for detailed information, and what will flourish when.

You will learn, for instance, that "first season" cucumbers may be grown from late February to late April. The next season you may plant them is July through August. The first season, it may be best to start with seed planting because it will be easier to protect tiny plants in case there is a late freeze. Then in July you can use transplants, giving you a headstart on the growth cycle. It should also be noted that you will see more pests in the fall. It takes longer for them to recover from winter, so you see less in spring. See https://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/vh027 to learn about gardening with transplants. Tomatoes follow the same two-season growing pattern as cucumbers and peppers.

It really upsets me to drive by a site being prepared for one or more homes and see every single tree removed. Why is that necessary and can anything be done about it?

It is shocking to see building sites completely devoid of trees, especially if large, old trees covered the site. Builders do that because it is much cheaper to build on a cleared site than to build around the trees. Depending on where you live, there may be building codes that require replacement of trees or mitigation (payment) to the city to account for the trees. The problem with that system is that replacement trees are necessarily much younger than the beautiful old trees they replace. It is also more convenient for builders to just pay the mitigation fee for removing trees. It is important to stay in touch with lawmakers in your area, to have input on solutions.

Smart urban planning is coming to the fore in many places with increased concern for environmental damage caused by lack of planning and destabilizing old roots that could lead to the death of trees remaining around the perimeter of the site. See https://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/fr260. Urban and community forestry can make a difference in our lives. Communities are becoming more aware of the contribution trees make to our neighborhoods. Trees play a huge role in our lives. They bring beauty and add natural character to our surroundings. Additionally, trees reduce air pollution, reduce surface runoff from storms and increase ground water recharge that is significantly reduced by paving. Large trees around your house can provide shade in hotter months that can reduce air conditioning costs by as much as 30 percent. Trees bring us much more than beauty. See https://www.state.sc.us/forest/urbben.htm.

A note for your information. If you enjoyed a question I answered about lawns and conservation in our July 26 column, I recommend a recent New York Times article on the history of lawns in America. It is marvelous and you can find it here https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/100000006542254/climate-change-lawns.html? searchResultPosition=1.

Texto completo: The New York Times has begun a major initiative, the "1619 Project," to observe the 400th anniversary of the beginning of American slavery. It aims to reframe American history so that slavery and the contributions of black Americans explain who we are as a nation. Nikole Hannah-Jones, staff writer for The New York Times Magazine wrote the lead article, "America Wasn't a Democracy, Until Black Americans Made It One." She writes, "Without the idealistic, strenuous and patriotic efforts of black Americans, our democracy today would most likely look very different - it might not be a democracy at all."
There are several challenges one can make about Hannah-Jones' article, but I'm going to focus on the article's most serious error, namely that the nation's founders intended for us to be a democracy. That error is shared by too many Americans. The word democracy appears nowhere in the two most fundamental founding documents of our nation - the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution. Instead of a democracy, the Constitution's Article IV, Section 4, declares, "The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government." Think about it and ask yourself whether our Pledge of Allegiance says to "the democracy for which it stands" or to "the republic for which it stands."
The founders had utter contempt for democracy. James Madison, the acknowledged father of the Constitution, wrote in Federalist Paper No. 10, that in a pure democracy "there is nothing to check the inducement to sacrifice the weaker party or the obnoxious individual." At the 1787 Constitutional Convention, delegate Edmund Randolph said, "that in tracing these evils to their origin every man had found it in the turbulence and follies of democracy."
The U.S. Constitution is replete with anti-majority rule, undemocratic provisions. One provision, heavily criticized, is the Electoral College. In their wisdom, the framers gave us the Electoral College so that in presidential elections, heavily populated states could not run roughshod over sparsely populated states. In order to amend the Constitution, it requires a two-thirds vote of both Houses, or two-thirds of state legislatures, to propose an amendment, and requires three-fourths of state legislatures for ratification. Part of the reason for having a bicameral Congress is that it places another obstacle to majority rule. Fifty-one senators can block the wishes of 435 representatives and 49 senators. The president, with a veto, can thwart the will of all 535 members of Congress. It takes a two-thirds vote, not just a majority, of both houses of Congress to override a presidential veto.
In addition to not understanding our Constitution, Hannah-Jones' article fails to acknowledge that black Americans have made the greatest gains, over some of the highest hurdles in the shortest span of time than any other racial group in mankind's history. The evidence: If black Americans were thought of as a nation with our own gross domestic product, we'd rank among the 20 wealthiest nations. It was a black American, Gen. Colin Powell, who headed the world's mightiest military. A few black Americans are among the world's wealthiest. Black Americans are among the world's most famous personalities.
The significance of this is that in 1865, neither a slave nor a slave owner would have believed that such progress would be possible in less than a century and a half, if ever. As such, it speaks to the intestinal fortitude of a people. Just as importantly, it speaks to the greatness of a nation within which such progress was possible, progress that would have been impossible anywhere else. The challenge before us is how those gains can be extended to a large percentage of black people for whom they appear elusive.

Trump denies U.S. had a role in destroying Iranian rocket

Texto completo: One day after an Iranian rocket appeared to explode on its launchpad, President Trump denied U.S. responsibility Friday for the extensive damage and released an unusually detailed aerial photo of the debris-strewn launch site.
His denial appears geared to limit speculation that the explosion was caused by a cyberattack, an increasingly common but normally covert mode of attack that U.S. forces have used against Iran in the past.
In his tweet, Trump appeared to reach out to officials in Tehran after months of mounting tensions. "I wish Iran best wishes and good luck in determining what happened," he wrote.

But the tweet also carried a surprise -- a high-resolution reconnaissance image of the damaged Imam Khomeini Space Center in northern Iran, with annotations identifying damaged vehicles and scorched facilities.
Experts on satellite imagery said the photo's resolution surpasses the clarity of satellite images on the commercial market, suggesting that Trump had shared classified material on his decidedly unclassified Twitter account.
"My jaw dropped seeing this," said Ankit Panda, an adjunct senior fellow at the nonpartisan Federation of American Scientists. "We're telling all of our adversaries the level of optical imagery we're able to obtain from space-based assets."
It's unclear how the image made it to Trump's Twitter feed. It appears to show the reflection of a camera flash, suggesting it may be a smartphone photo of another image -- the kind that might have been shared with the president in his intelligence briefing Friday.
"This is wild," said David Joseph Schmerler, a senior research associate at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, a graduate school. "This is something that the public can't get their hands on unless the president decides to tweet it out."
Schmerler has analyzed commercially available images of the launch site, and said many of the details were blurry. Trump's tweet, by contrast, clearly shows damaged vehicles and large writing around the ring of the launchpad.
U.S. intelligence officials normally seek to protect reconnaissance capabilities. But presidents are authorized to declassify any information they want, and Trump defended his decision.
"We had a photo and I released it, which I have the absolute right to do," he told reporters outside the White House before heading to the presidential retreat at Camp David in northern Maryland for the weekend.
"The president does have the ability to declassify things if he or she wants to do so," said Eric Brewer, who served as director for counter-proliferation at the National Security Council until last year. "But normally there's an attempt to understand the risks or benefits of taking such a step."
Trump has faced criticism for loosely handling sensitive information before. In May 2017, he sparked controversy when he shared highly classified intelligence, reportedly from Israel, with the Russian foreign minister.
Trump's tweet comes at a delicate time for U.S. relations with Iran. Trump has increased sanctions on Tehran and pulled out of the landmark 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran, claiming it was flawed.
But he signaled last week that he was willing to meet with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani to reopen negotiations.
The U.S. has used cyberattacks against Iran in the past, such as working with Israel to deploy the Stuxnet computer worm to sabotage centrifuges in Iran's nuclear enrichment program prior to 2010.
In addition, the New York Times recently reported that U.S. Cyber Command successfully targeted Iranian paramilitary forces this summer to limit their ability to attack oil tankers in the Persian Gulf.

Fire Hydrants: New York's Cool Solution for 100 Years

Texto completo: More than a century after it was published, the article reads like slapstick comedy from the silent-movie era.
It was May 1904. A street cleaner had inadvertently left a wrench beside a fire hydrant. Then a mischievous boy came along. What could go wrong?
The New York Times described the child -- "a diminutive messenger boy, carrying a big suit case" -- as well as the wild rumpus that ensued: "In less than a minute, the adjoining territory was a seething flood. The boy calmly turned on the water full force, threw the wrench beyond all chance of recovery, (down the sewer at the corner) and then coolly sat down on the suit case to watch the results of his mischief." A policeman "bravely endeavored to move the faucet with his bare hands." It was useless. "Get a cork!" the boy taunted.
"Busy Street Deluged," the headline read. "A Little Boy's Prank."
The exuberant photographs you see here were shot by The Times throughout the 20th century, running with captions such as "Cooling Off City-Style" and "AH! THAT FEELS GOOD!" One caption writer was even moved to pronounce the fire hydrant as "the lifeline of summer, spewing cooling excitement to all around it." That is certainly true. But even after the city began distributing sprinkler caps in the 1950s to reduce the amount of wasted water, fireplugs continued to be opened illegally, becoming a source of tension and sometimes violence.
Much of the rancor stemmed from the fact that New York's poor ranked low among the city's priorities -- and knew it.
During the catastrophic days of August 4-13, 1896, it was as hot as 120 degrees inside the tenements on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. At least 1,300 people died in New York City from the heat, many of them immigrants working 60 hours or more a week. The mayor had declined to lift the ban on sleeping in parks and didn't assemble his team to strategize until the 10th day of the heat wave. Theodore Roosevelt, then the city's 37-year-old police commissioner, became something of a hero by handing out ice in alleys behind the tenements. Later, he remembered in his autobiography the "gasping misery of the little children and of the worn-out mothers" and compared the scene to a cholera epidemic.
In June 1925, another brutal heat wave hit. Hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers fled their homes, often with their bedding, to sleep in parks, on beaches, even in the grass by the roadside. The opening of hydrants was still a new enough phenomenon that The Times took pains to describe it in detail: "Small groups of children in bathing suits would gather about a fire hydrant. Then some one would get a wrench and open the hydrant and a stick would be placed in the nozzle to cause the water to spurt skyward and the children would jump under the shower."
The fire commissioner feared that a fire would break out and that water pressure would be insufficient to combat it. He asked the police to guard the hydrants.
In the years that followed, the situation only worsened.
On June 9, 1933, about 400 young people demonstrated in front of the police station on West 47th Street, protesting officers for shutting down hydrants down during heat waves.
By July 4, 1961, tempers and temperatures were such that residents hurled rocks and bottles at officers when they arrived with wrenches. "Yesterday," The Times reported, "Police Headquarters issued air raid helmets to all members of the force with orders to put them on before raiding illegally opened fire hydrants."
There's a boisterous scene with a flowing hydrant in Spike Lee's 1989 movie, "Do the Right Thing." The level of detail is striking, starting with the real-life Times headline shown in the film: "Yes, It's Hotter, It's Muggier, and, Yes, You're Going Crazy." You see a fireplug opened with a wrench. You see two young men rubbing the tops off cans on the sidewalk so they can use them to aim the water like a fire hose.
More important, you see the same thing you see in these images from The Times's archives: how drastically water can transform a neighborhood that's desperate for relief.

Texto completo: A recent Economic Policy Institute Study titled “CEO Compensation Has Grown 940 Percent Since 1978” is a Labor Day lament for American workers whose wages during the same period have only increased a meager 12%.
EPI’s analysis found that this exorbitant, unconscionable earnings differential is the major income inequality contributor, and has persisted through equally indifferent Democrat and Republican administrations.
In its analysis, EPI emphasizes that CEOs earn more not because of demand skills, extraordinary productivity or other tangibles, but rather because of their absolute power to set and increase their pay scales. As a result of soaring CEO incomes, and, more generally, higher executive compensation, the top 0.1% and 1.0% income brackets have exploded, while workers in the lower 90% of the earnings bracket have been left in the cold for more than four decades.
EPI also noted that the economy wouldn’t suffer if CEOs were paid less or taxed more, or if profits were distributed more fairly among all employees.
CEOs have unquestionably taken full advantage of their power to enrich themselves and suppress lower-echelon employee wages. But another variable that contributes to 40 years of flat wages for hourly workers is the executive suite’s addiction to cheap, foreign labor.
With what has been an unbroken inflow of illegal immigrant and legal guest workers, between 750,000 and 1 million annually, corporations have no incentive to increase domestic workers’ salaries – and they haven’t.
Unwittingly, a New York Times story provided an excellent example of how the immigration variable depresses the domestic salary scale. In “Is Immigration at its Limit? Not According to Employers,” so many immigrants have come to the South Florida area that not enough labor is available to fill all the restaurant, nursing home and retail store jobs.
The story was a typical immigration cheerleading piece that offered the well-worn and misleading talking points. From Douglas Holtz-Eakin, former Congressional Budget Office director and now the immigration advocacy group American Action Forum’s leader: “Without immigration, we shrink as a nation.” Holtz-Eakin added that two ingredients drive GDP growth – the size of the workforce and how efficiently those workers produce goods and services.
Columbia Business School Dean Glenn Hubbard has a better understanding of GDP. Last year, Hubbard said that the goal isn’t GDP, but rather to deliver mass prosperity that makes people feel like they’re all part of the same system instead of being left behind. Hubbard calls his theory the economics of dignity, something that the EPI study confirmed that the U.S. has moved far away from.
Hubbard and others would also be skeptical of how more immigration into South Florida could contribute to mass prosperity. By 2030, the state’s population is projected to increase from today’s 21 million to 26 million – with that unchecked growth comes more traffic, more sprawl, more school overcrowding, higher housing costs and a lower quality of life.
That immigration grows the economy is the age-old, half-truth argument. Sure, more people and more workers create a bigger economy. But immigration does not help the per capita income. Immigration’s benefits accrue to the immigrants and to their employers, and not the general public.
The traditional solution to filling job openings is to offer higher wages, not import more cheap labor. With more than 6.1 million people unemployed, that pool should be tapped first.
Congress will soon reconvene, but as it has been for too many legislative sessions, creating a fairer immigration system that protects, instead of harms, American workers isn’t on the agenda.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Former FBI Director James Comey violated FBI policies in his handling of memos documenting private conversations with President Donald Trump, the Justice Department's inspector general said Thursday.
The watchdog office said Comey broke bureau rules by giving one memo containing unclassified information to a friend with instructions to share the contents with a reporter. Comey also failed to return his memos to the FBI after he was dismissed in May 2017, retaining copies of some of them in a safe at home, and shared them with his personal lawyers, the report said.
"By not safeguarding sensitive information obtained during the course of his FBI employment, and by using it to create public pressure for official action, Comey set a dangerous example for the over 35,000 current FBI employees - and the many thousands more former FBI employees - who similarly have access to or knowledge of non-public information, the report said.
The report is the second in as many years to criticize Comey's actions as FBI director, following a separate inspector general rebuke for decisions made during the investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server. It is one of multiple inspector general investigations undertaken in the last three years into the decisions and actions of Comey and other senior FBI leaders.
Trump, who has long regarded Comey as one of his principal antagonists in a law enforcement community he sees as biased against him, cheered the conclusions on Twitter. He wrote: "Perhaps never in the history of our Country has someone been more thoroughly disgraced and excoriated than James Comey in the just released Inspector General's Report. He should be ashamed of himself!
The White House in a separate statement called Comey a "proven liar and leaker.
But the report denied Trump and his supporters, who have repeatedly accused Comey of leaking classified information, total vindication. It found that none of the information shared by him or his attorneys with anyone in the media was classified, and the Justice Department has declined to prosecute Comey.
Comey seized on that point in defending himself on Twitter, saying, "I don't need a public apology from those who defamed me, but a quick message with a sorry we lied about you' would be nice.
He also added: "And to all those who've spent two years talking about me going to jail' or being a liar and a leaker' - ask yourselves why you still trust people who gave you bad info for so long, including the president.
At issue in the report are seven memos Comey wrote between January 2017 and April 2017 about conversations with Trump that he found unnerving or unusual.
These include a Trump Tower briefing at which Comey advised the president-elect that there was salacious and unverified information about his ties to Moscow circulating in Washington, a dinner at which Comey says Trump asked him for loyalty and an Oval Office meeting weeks later at which Comey says the president asked him to drop an investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn.
One week after he was fired, Comey provided a copy of the memo about Flynn to Dan Richman, his personal lawyer and a close friend, and instructed him to share the contents with a specific reporter from The New York Times.
Comey has said he wanted to make details of that conversation public to prompt the appointment of a special counsel to lead the FBI's investigation into ties between Russia and the Trump campaign. Former FBI Director Robert Mueller was appointed special counsel one day after the story broke.
The inspector general's office found Comey's rationale lacking.
"In a country built on the rule of law, it is of utmost importance that all FBI employees adhere to Department and FBI policies, particularly when confronted by what appear to be extraordinary circumstances or compelling personal convictions. Comey had several other lawful options available to him to advocate for the appointment of a Special Counsel, which he told us was his goal in making the disclosure, the report says.
"What was not permitted was the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive investigative information, obtained during the course of FBI employment, in order to achieve a personally desired outcome, it adds.
Comey said he considered his memos to be personal rather than government documents, and it never would've occurred to him to give them back to the FBI after he was fired. The inspector general's office disagreed, citing policy that FBI employees must give up all documents with FBI information once they leave the bureau.
FBI agents retrieved four of Comey's memos from his house weeks after he was fired.
The office of Inspector General Michael Horowitz also is investigating the FBI's Russia investigation and expected to wrap up soon.
Last year, the watchdog office concluded that former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe had misrepresented under oath his involvement in a news media disclosure, and referred him for possible prosecution. That matter remains open with the U.S. Attorney's Office in Washington.

Turnabout isn't fair play to whining New York Times

Texto completo: The New York Times, an organization devoted to gathering and publishing information, doesn't want people to gather or publish information inconvenient to it.
A group of operatives supporting President Donald Trump has been finding and archiving old social media postings of Times employees and other journalists for use in the ongoing brawl between the president and the press. There's no indication that this is Dumpster diving rather than an effort to scour readily available sources for stupid, embarrassing or offensive things that journalists have said publicly under their own power.
The Times broke the news of the campaign in an alarmed-sounding report. It related that “the material publicized so far, while in some cases stripped of context or presented in misleading ways, has proved authentic, and much of it has been professionally harmful to its targets.”
It's not clear what makes this different from what happens in our public life ... every ... single ... day. Headhunting based on past offenses, real and imagined, is the norm, indeed one of the left's favored forms of ideological combat.
Nonetheless, the press and its progressive allies act as though the First Amendment is being endangered if journalists apologize for past things they've written or depending on the decisions of their own organizations get cashiered for them.“The goal of this campaign is clearly to intimidate journalists from doing their job,” thundered Times publisher A.G. Sulzberger, “which includes serving as a check on power and exposing wrongdoing when it occurs. The Times will not be intimidated or silenced.”
A spokesman for CNN went further, saying that when government officials, “and those working on their behalf, threaten and retaliate against reporters as a means of suppression, it's a clear abandonment of democracy for something very dangerous.”
The MSNBC host Joy Reid tweeted, then deleted, “Welcome to the age of digital brownshirtism.” This is the usual hysteria yoked to the usual foggy thinking. The First Amendment is an important protection of press freedom. Yet nothing in it protects members of the press from criticism, let alone criticism over things they have written. Such criticisms are exercises of free speech in response to other exercises of free speech i.e., public debate. If the Times and others don't like the weaponization of foolhardy and untoward social media postings, they can start pushing back against it across the board.
The left-wing organization Media Matters for America exists to publicize allegedly controversial statements by conservative media figures toward the end of getting them fired or ushered off the air. If recirculating the past tweets of employees of liberal news organizations is undemocratic, why isn't the work of Media Matters also dangerously authoritarian?
The Times may say that it won't be “intimidated” by pressure over past postings, but it has readily surrendered to such pressure from the left. The paper pulled the plug on its hiring of tech writer Quinn Norton last year when it emerged she had tweeted offensive terms about gays and blacks, albeit sardonically. The hounding of conservatives isn't considered beyond the pale; it's considered sport. Much of the left would be rendered practically mute if it weren't braying for people to be fired.
When The Atlantic had the temerity to hire my colleague Kevin Williamson, a fearless and brilliant libertarian controversialist, seemingly every liberal outlet in the country joined in the pile-on. Williamson's hiring was swiftly revoked, with none of his critics detecting a threat to democracy in the episode. Williamson has written a keen book about his experience, “The Smallest Minority: Independent Thinking in the Age of the Mob Politics”.
I think it's a bad idea for either side to rummage through old social media postings and writings looking for firing offenses. It's an inherently punitive project, and often an unfair one no one is the sum of their tweets. But the rules of this game were established by the left long ago. It should change them or stop whining.

Texto completo: Police in Mobile, Alabama, have issued an arrest warrant for former Warriors center DeMarcus Cousins on a misdemeanor domestic violence charge, USA Today reports.
The mother of Cousins' son recorded a phone conversation in which a man is heard telling her he will "put a bullet in your (expletive) head." She told police the person on the other line was Cousins.
She filed a police report on the call and sent a copy of the recording to TMZ Sports.
USA Today reports that Mobile's court website lists a third-degree harassing communications charge against Cousins. The argument stemmed from Cousins' desire to have his son travel to attend his wedding, which was last weekend.
The alleged victim confirmed to USA Today that she knew of the warrant. This news organization has chosen not to identify her in this story.
Cousins tore his ACL earlier in the offseason after signing a one-year, $3.5 million deal with the Lakers.
ZAZA IS BACK >> Zaza Pachulia, a contributor to a pair of Warriors championships, retired from the NBA and joined Golden State as a consultant, the team announced. The 35-year-old Pachulia, who was the starting center for the Warriors during their title years in 2017 and '18, spent last season with the Pistons. After ending his 16-year playing career, he'll contribute to Golden State in both the business and basketball operations, according to Marc Stein of the New York Times.
In another big move, the team promoted Kirk Lacob, owner Joe Lacob's son who has spent nine years as an integral part of the Warriors' braintrust, to executive vice president of basketball operations. He was most recently an assistant general manager.
Mike Dunleavy Jr., a former Warriors player, was also given a promotion. After spending last season as a Warriors scout, the former No. 1 pick was elevated to assistant general manager.
In addition, Kent Lacob, the younger son of owner Joe Lacob, was promoted from general manager of the Santa Cruz Warriors to the Warriors' director of team development.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL
UCLA LOSES OPENER >> Junior running back Michael Warren II scored one touchdown on the ground and caught one of sophomore quarterback Desmond Ridder's two scoring passes as the University of Cincinnati Bearcats beat the UCLA Bruins 24-14 in the teams' season-opener in Cincinnati.
UCLA sophomore quarterback Dorian Thompson-Robinson was 8 for 26 for 156 yards and touchdowns of 75 yards to Demetric Felton and seven yards to Chase Cota.
TOP-RANKED CLEMSON ROLLS BEHIND ETIENNE >> Travis Etienne ran for a career-high 205 yards and three touchdowns, including one from 90 yards out, and No. 1 Clemson overpowered Georgia Tech 52-14 at home for its 16th straight victory.
On an offense filled with stars, it was Etienne who shone brightest for the defending national champions. His 90-yard score tied for the longest rushing TD in Tigers history. Clemson opened a 35-0 lead and was never pressed by the Yellow Jackets in the season opener for both Atlantic Coast Conference teams.
HURRICANE FORCES FLORIDA STATE TO CHANGE COURSE >> The college football season opener for Boise State and Florida State will kick off a few hours sooner and a little further inland with discounted ticket prices because of the threat of Hurricane Dorian. Officials announced that the game will be played Saturday at Florida State's Doak Campbell Stadium in Tallahassee and start at 9 a.m., seven hours before it was originally scheduled to start in Jacksonville.
TRACK AND FIELD
NORWAY'S WARHOLM SPEEDS TO 400-METER WIN >> Karsten Warholm ran the second-fastest time in history to win the men's 400 meters hurdles in 46.92 seconds at the Diamond League finals in Zurich. The 23-year-old world champion from Norway took 0.20 seconds off his lifetime best, but was 0.14 behind the 27-year-old world record set by Kevin Young at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics.
In the men's 100, Noah Lyles surged late to win in 9.98, leaving world champion Justin Gatlin back in fourth.
TENNIS
MURRAY LOSES IN CHALLENGE EVENT >> Andy Murray lost 3-6, 6-4, 7-6 (3) to 240th-ranked Matteo Viola in the third round of a second-tier Challenger Tour tournament hosted by Rafael Nadal's tennis academy in Mallorca, Spain. The 32-year-old Murray returned to the courts in June playing doubles including at Wimbledon before moving back to singles this month. Murray is on the road to recovery following hip surgery in January.
GOLF
CONCORD'S NOH ONE SHOT OFF PACE IN PORTLAND >> Mi Jung Hur and Hannah Green each shot 8-under 64 to share the firstround lead at the LPGA's Portland (Oregon) Classic, with Jane Park and 18-year-old Monday qualifier Yealimi Noh of Concord a shot back.
Top-ranked Jin Young Ko finally made a bogey, ending a record run of 114 consecutive holes without dropping a shot and finished with a 4-under 68.
MOTOR SPORTS
BOTTAS CELEBRATES IN STYLE >> Valtteri Bottas' 30th birthday celebrations were made even better by Mercedes giving him a new contract for next year. Mercedes gave the Finnish driver a one-year-extension, making 2020 his fourth season alongside world champion Lewis Hamilton. The relieved Bottas signed the paperwork last weekend, and then celebrated in style. "I turned 30 yesterday (Wednesday). I didn't have a party yesterday, but the day before I had one. It was a good one," Bottas said ahead of the Belgian Grand Prix. "I knew by then everything was done, so it was actually nice to celebrate with close people."
SOCCER
LLOYD SHINES IN FRONT OF HOME FANS >> Carli Lloyd had a goal and an assist in front of her hometown fans, and the U.S. women's national team continued its post-World Cup victory tour with a 4-0 win over Portugal in front of a record crowd in Philadelphia.
The announced attendance of 49,504 at Lincoln Financial Field was the largest ever for a standalone friendly game for the U.S. women.

Texto completo: Donald Trump is unpopular, but he retains the loyalty of some important groups. Among the most loyal are America’s farmers, who are a tiny minority of the population but exert disproportionate political influence because of our electoral system, which gives 3.2 million Iowans as many senators as almost 40 million Californians. According to one recent poll, 71% of farmers approve of Trump’s performance — which is down somewhat from previous polling, but remains far above the national average.
Yet farmers are hurting financially. Investors are worried about a possible recession for the economy as a whole, but the farm recession is already here, with falling incomes, rising delinquency rates and surging bankruptcies. And the farm economy’s troubles stem directly from Trump’s policies.
This apparent contradiction — Trump is inflicting the greatest harm on the people who supported him most — isn’t an accident. Farmers’ past support for Trump was predictable: The demography and culture of (white) rural America make it fertile ground for politicians promising to restore traditional society, and especially traditional racial hierarchy. But farmers’ financial distress should also have been predictable: While rural America may dislike and distrust cosmopolitan elites, the U.S. farm economy is hugely dependent on global markets, and it has inevitably been a major victim of the Trumpian trade war.
The questions, looking forward, are whether farmers understood what they were getting themselves into, whether they understand even now that their distress isn’t likely to end anytime soon, and whether economic pain will shake their support for the man who’s causing it.
At one level, it’s not hard to see why farmers supported Trump. Hostility to nonwhite immigrants was central to his campaign, and such hostility tends to be highest in places where there aren’t actually many immigrants. So rural America, with its still tiny immigrant population, was a receptive audience for his fear-mongering. More generally, Making America Great Again — which was basically about setting back the clock racially and culturally — was a message that played well in places that still tend to think of themselves (and are told by politicians to think of themselves) as the Real America, as opposed to the big metropolitan areas where most Americans actually live.
On the other hand, while farm country may be notably lacking in ethnic diversity and feels generally distrustful of globalists, the farm economy is in fact deeply integrated with and dependent on world markets. On the eve of Trump’s trade war, America exported 76% of its cotton production, 55% of its sorghum, half its soybeans, and 46% of its wheat.
Overall, U.S. agricultural exports are almost 40% of the value of farm production, up from just 15% circa 1970. Globalization hurt some parts of U.S. manufacturing, with particularly harsh effects on some small industrial cities. But the rise of China and the growth of world trade have been nothing but good news for farmers.
And here’s the thing: It shouldn’t have been hard to predict that Trumponomics would be bad for farmers. Trump’s desire for a trade war was out in the open from the beginning; protectionism is right up there with racism and anti-environmentalism as one of his core values. And a trade war was bound to hurt farm exports. Did anyone really imagine that China, an economic superpower with its own fierce nationalism, wouldn’t retaliate against U.S. tariffs?
So what were farmers thinking? My guess is that they let the will to believe override their judgment. Trump seemed like their kind of guy. He certainly seemed to share their dislike for urban elites who, they imagined, looked down on people like them. So they convinced themselves that he knew what he was doing, that he would win his trade war and that they would be among the victors sharing the spoils.
Even now many farmers seem to believe that the pain will end any day now, that Trump will soon announce a deal that restores all the old markets and more.
In short, farmers’ support for Trump should be seen as a form of affinity fraud, in which people fall for a con man whom they imagine to be someone like them.
And as is often the case in such frauds, the con man and his associates actually have contempt for their marks.
Recently Sonny Perdue, the agriculture secretary, let the mask slip during a meeting with farmers complaining about their plight. “What do you call two farmers in a basement?” he snarked. “A whine cellar.”
Trump’s own remarks about trade with Japan were even more telling. According to a White House transcript, Trump complained that while Japan sends us millions of cars, “We send them wheat. Wheat. (Laughter.)” Do farmers realize that their president considers their livelihood a joke?
So what will happen as the trade war drags on? Don’t expect farmers to suddenly exclaim en masse, “Hey, we’ve been had!” Real life doesn’t work that way. But they have, in fact, been had, and they may finally be starting to realize it.

Seth Rogen hosting marijuana-fueled charity carnival for Alzheimer's research

Texto completo: Marijuana Moment is a wire service assembled by Tom Angell, a marijuana legalization activist and journalist covering marijuana reform nationwide. The views expressed by Angell or Marijuana Moment are neither endorsed by the Globe nor do they reflect the Globe's views on any subject area.
Actor Seth Rogen will be the ringmaster at an adults-only charity carnival next month featuring comedians running game booths and marijuana aplenty.
Proceeds from the Hilarity for Charity County Fair will go toward research into combating Alzheimer's disease, an issue close to Rogen.
“We here at Hilarity for Charity love to fight Alzheimer's disease, but we also love rides, alcohol and weed!" Rogen, who launched his own cannabis company in March, said in a promotional video for the Los Angeles event. “We also love trying to be good people so that in the event there is an afterlife, we don't go to hell."
Comedians Adam Devine, Andrew Rannells, Ben Feldman, Casey Wilson, Ilana Glazer, Ike Barinholtz, Jeff Ross, Josh Gad, Kate Micucci, Nick Kroll, Regina Hall, and Riki Lindhome are participating in the event. Skateboarder Tony Hawk is set to do a halfpipe performance. And rapper Anderson Paak will also put on a show.
Details of where cannabis fits into the program aren't available on the event site. But Gad, one of the comedians participating, noted in a tweet that this is “the only fair I will attend this year other than my children's book fair which has a lot less readily available weed."
Rogen's passion for fighting Alzheimer's isn't new. He's become an outspoken activist for research into the disease after he witnessed his mother-in-law develop early onset Alzheimer's.
In 2014, the actor opened his testimony before a Senate committee hearing on Alzheimer's research by joking that he wasn't there to discuss the topic some might expect: marijuana.
“First I should answer the question I assume many of you are asking, yes I'm aware this has nothing to do with the legalization of marijuana," he said. “In fact, if you can believe it, this concerns something that I find even more important."
Though he didn't bring it up at the hearing, research has demonstrated that cannabis can help eliminate a toxic protein associated with Alzheimer's disease. Last year, the federal government asked the public to submit additional scientific research into the potential therapeutic benefits of marijuana in the treatment of the condition.

Texto completo: SPRINGFIELD — Illinois is taking steps to combat troubling maternal and infant mortality statistics after one lawmaker was moved to action by a series of reports which showcased the state’s and country’s maternal health shortcomings, particularly among African-American women.
The lawmaker is Chicago Democrat Mary Flowers. The troubling statistics: Pregnancy-related complications kill more mothers in the United States than in any other developed country, and African-American mothers die at three to four times the rate of white mothers.
"What is happening and what has been happening is truly unacceptable," Flowers said. "I can only go back to the articles that I read about the unconscious bias and untreated conditions and unrecognized factors that lead to poor outcomes when it comes down to African-American women and women of childbearing age. It’s unacceptable."
Last week, Gov. J.B. Pritzker signed the last bills from a package of new laws to create new maternal legal rights and a task force to study the high death rate among African-American mothers and babies, to force hospitals to collect more accurate data on maternal mortality and be better equipped to treat pregnant women, and to mandate proper training for medical staff that are likely to treat pregnant women.
Troubling Statistics The U.S. weakness in maternal health care was detailed in a 2017 study by National Public Radio and ProPublica which showed 26.4 of each 100,000 mothers in the U.S. died from pregnancy-related complications in 2015, while the next closest developed country was the United Kingdom with 9.2 per 100,000.
The racial disparities are driven home in a report by the Illinois Department of Public Health which said an average of 73 women in Illinois died each year from 2008 to 2016 within one year of pregnancy, and African-American women were six times more likely to die of a pregnancy-related condition during that span. According to the report, 72 percent of those deaths and 93 percent of violent pregnancy-associated deaths were preventable.
State Sen. Jacqueline Collins, a Chicago Democrat and Senate sponsor of several of Flowers’ maternal health care measures, said the disparities existed across income and education levels.
"We found that a lot of highly educated black women in high paying careers are more likely to die as a consequence of childbirth than a white woman without even a high school diploma," she said.
Flowers said a 2018 New York Times Magazine article which also caught her attention detailed that, in the U.S., African-American infants were more than twice as likely to die than white infants, at 11.3 deaths per 1,000 babies and 4.9 deaths per 1,000 babies, respectively.
While infant deaths have decreased to 30 times less than what they were in 1850 for African-American babies, the number decreased by 44 times for white babies, making the disparity between the races even larger today than it was during that pre-Civil War era.
"That was more than a decade before the abolishment of slavery," Flowers said. "Now, that tells me there’s some real problems here in the United States."
Accurate data In response to the reports, Flowers called two committee hearings last year which she said brought forth further revelations.
Her committee heard testimony about poor hospital funding and readiness to handle childbirth in certain communities, obstacles to continuity of care and poor documentation of preexisting conditions for people with low incomes, and systemic bias and racism in the medical profession which leads to stress on patients and their health concerns sometimes being ignored by doctors.
"Doctors testified to racism, and they also testified to implicit bias and all other kinds of problems that needed to be addressed as well as training," she said. "And we know that more women are dying from something as simple as hemorrhaging, and it’s not being addressed."
To look further into the driving forces of maternal and infant mortality rates, Flowers sponsored and unanimously passed House Bill 1, which was signed by the governor in July to create the Task Force on Infant and Maternal Mortality Among African Americans.
The task force will be comprised of state health officials, doctors, midwives and medical professionals, hospital and insurance leaders, community experts in infant and maternal health, and an African-American woman who has experienced a traumatic pregnancy.
The task force will meet quarterly and report findings to the General Assembly by Dec. 1, 2020, on the causes and rates of maternal death and ways to improve the quality and safety of maternity care.
"It’s been well known in African-American communities that there were certain disparities in care and how doctors perceive our pain, but we never had the data to back it up, or to make that determination," Collins said. "And so this is really getting at it."
Another measure, House Bill 3, requires hospitals to include in each of their state-mandated quarterly reports any instances of preterm infants, infant mortality and maternal mortality, and the racial and ethnic information of the mothers in those instances.
Collins said accurate data is necessary to more clearly define the problem in Illinois, and "just to put the issue on the radar screen."
"We want to hold hospitals accountable so we can have accurate data and gauge the scope of this problem," she said. "This task force will focus on a data-driven approach to crafting policy."
Maternal rights House Bill 2 is another unanimously-passed bill in the maternal mortality package, and it adds 19 new rights for pregnant women to the Medical Patient Rights Act. The Act was established in the 1990s, laying out rights for medical patients that, if violated by a health care provider or insurance company, can result in a fine ranging from $500 to $1,000.
House Bill 2 adds to that act, giving a woman the right to receive health care for herself and her baby before, during and after childbirth, to be treated with respect at all times, to contact with her baby when medically possible, and to refuse any treatment to the extent medically possible.
A woman also has the right to choose a certified nurse midwife or physician as her maternity care professional, to seek different caregivers if they are unsatisfied, to know the names of those providing her care, and to receive information about her condition and possible treatments.
Women also have the right to receive medical information in a language they understand, and to receive information about breastfeeding.
As well, a woman can choose her birth setting from a full range of options in her community, be informed if caregivers enter her or her baby in a research study, and has a right to give birth in the position of her choice within generally accepted medical standards.
"These rights show that a woman is to be respected," Flowers said.
The bill also gives a right to privacy and confidentiality, emotional and physical support during childbirth, and the ability for a mother to decide collaboratively with caregivers when she and her baby will leave the birth site.
Finally, women have the right, regardless of how they are paying for their stay, to receive an explanation of the total bill for services, including itemized charges for specific services received as part of her maternity care.
"We know that patients have rights, but it’s unfortunate that we need to enumerate them, the kind of rights that should be so basic, and universally understood," Collins said.
Other measures Another of the bills which received unanimous approval, House Bill 5, directs the Department of Human Services to ensure pregnant and postpartum mothers have access to substance use disorder services that are gender-responsive and trauma-informed.
House Bill 2433, which passed 56-0 in the Senate and 111-2 in the House, requires every hospital to have the proper instruments available to take a pregnant woman’s blood pressure.
House Bill 2438, which also passed unanimously, amends the insurance code to require insurers to cover any mental health condition that occurs during pregnancy or during the postpartum period.
House Bill 2895, which passed the House 109-2 and the Senate 55-0, requires all birthing facilities to conduct continuing education yearly for all staff that may care for pregnant or postpartum women. That training must include modules on management of severe maternal hypertension and hemorrhaging.

Kirsten Gillibrand drops out of presidential race

Texto completo: ALBANY – Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand dropped her bid for president Wednesday after she failed to qualify for the next Democratic debate.
Gillibrand, a New York Democrat, posted a video message to her supporters confirming her decision, making her the latest Democrat to drop out of the crowded field looking to challenge Republican President Donald Trump next year.
A 10-year veteran of the Senate, Gillibrand campaigned heavily throughout Iowa and New Hampshire in the months after launching her campaign in January.
But she struggled to raise campaign funds and generate support in the key public-opinion polls used to determine the field for the primary debates, leaving her out of next month's ABC News/Univision debate in Houston.
In a video posted to her social media accounts, Gillibrand vowed to continue to work to defeat Trump and flip the Senate into Democratic hands.
"I know this isn't the result we wanted," Gillibrand said. "We wanted to win this race. But it's important to know when it's not your time and to know how you can best serve your community and country."
Gillibrand, of Brunswick, Rensselaer County, made family-related issues a centerpiece of her campaign, often highlighting her experiences as a mother as she pushed for a national paid family leave policy.
She was also outspoken on abortion issues, vowing only to appoint Supreme Court justices who support Roe v. Wade abortion rights.
Gillibrand, 52, was re-elected to a six-year term in the Senate last November. Within days of her re-election, she confirmed interest in a 2020 presidential bid despite previously vowing to serve a full Senate term.
She has been in the Senate since 2009, when she was appointed to succeed Hillary Clinton, who had gone on to become secretary of state.
Prior to that, Gillibrand served in the House of Representatives, representing a conservative-leaning district north of Albany.
Gillibrand based her presidential campaign in Troy, not far from her upstate New York home.
Officially eliminated from debate This week, she was officially eliminated from the upcoming Sept. 12 debate when she failed to meet the Democratic National Committee's polling threshold, which required candidates to garner 2% support in at least four qualified polls and have at least 130,000 individual donors to make the debate stage.
In an interview with The New York Times, Gillibrand said she would endorse a Democratic candidate in the race but has not yet decided who.
She also vowed to support the eventual Democratic nominee.
Gillibrand did qualify for the first two Democratic primary debates, enjoying a viral moment in the second one when asked what her first act as president would be.
"The first thing that I'm going to do when I'm president is I'm going to Clorox the Oval Office," Gillibrand said to big applause.
In a tweet, Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, called Gillibrand a "great talent, a rising star in the Democratic Party & a good friend."
"The people of NY are fortunate to have her back full time," Cuomo tweeted.
Gillibrand's exit leaves two New York Democrats vying for their party's presidential nomination: New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and Andrew Yang, a New York City entrepreneur who was born in Schenectady.
Yang qualified for the next debate; de Blasio did not.

Texto completo: Jim Denomie, a member of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Ojibwe, has been named the 2019 McKnight Distinguished Artist. He is the first Native American artist to be chosen for the award since it began in 1998.
The McKnight is a special designation for many reasons. Given each year by the arts-supporting, Minneapolis-based McKnight Foundation, it is Minnesota’s highest cultural honor. Winners receive an unrestricted $50,000 cash prize, no small thing for most artists. The awards always and only go to Minnesota artists, people who have chosen to make their lives here and enrich our communities with their art. They join a diverse and exceptional group.
Denomie was born in 1955 on the Lac Courte Oreilles Reservation near Hayward, Wisconsin. He grew up in Chicago and south Minneapolis, experiencing firsthand the effects of government relocation programs and assimilation policies while maintaining a strong connection to his reservation.
Recognized early as a gifted young artist, Denomie was told by a high school guidance counselor that there was no future in art. He dropped out of high school and spent two decades working in construction. Then he went back to school at the University of Minnesota, where he was required to take a studio arts course. He graduated in 1995 with a bachelor of fine arts degree and started exhibiting his paintings soon after.
Today Denomie is an award-winning artist whose work is found at Mia, the Walker, the Weisman and the M, the Denver Art Museum, the Heard Museum in Phoenix, and Eiteljorg Museum in Indianapolis, among many others. It has been shown extensively in the United States and will travel this year to New Zealand and São Paolo.
Locally, Denomie is represented by the Bockley Gallery, which earlier this year held an exhibition of his “Standing Rock” paintings. These are large, highly detailed narrative works in oil on canvas. In each one, there’s a lot going on. You can look at any one of them for hours, wishing you had Denomie beside you to explain what every figure, action, object and gesture means, because they all mean something.
Denomie’s narrative works are his own contemporary extension of Ojibwe storytelling, filled with recognizable characters, archetypes, pop culture allusions and even humor. His portraits are just as potent, overflowing with vivid colors and emotional brushwork.
He has said that early on, he felt that people expected him to do “Indian art.” But “growing up in south Minneapolis, there weren’t a lot of eagles and buffalos and teepees.” So he found his own voice and went his own way.
In a statement, McKnight Foundation president Kate Wolford said, “Minnesota is Jim Denomie’s home, and its history has inspired many of his most powerful paintings … We’re thrilled to recognize an artist who is rooted in the Anishinaabe tradition of storytelling art and so deeply engaged in documenting the present day.”
Said Lori Lea Pourier, president/CEO of First Peoples Fund and a member of the selection committee, “I see [Denomie] as a modern day warrior documentarian, capturing and saving stories for the next 100 years in a contemporary voice.”
The picks
Tonight (Thursday, Aug. 29) at the Amsterdam: RISK! Live. If you don’t know “RISK!,” it’s a live show and a popular podcast (1.5 million downloads each month) where people tell true stories they never thought they would dare to share in public. We all have a few of those, don’t we? If you do know “RISK!,” you might already have tickets to this rare flyover-land performance; the show usully takes place in New York and Los Angeles, where people like Janeane Garofalo, Trevor Noah, Samantha Bee and Dan Savage hold forth. Show host Kevin Allison (MTV’s “The State”) will emcee a cast of local performers including Amy Salloway, Tyson Purcell, Gregory Pickett and Ernest Anfin. Bring empathy – this isn’t easy. 18+. Doors at 7, show at 8. FMI and tickets ($22). P.S. This month marks the show’s 10th anniversary.
Tonight through Saturday at the Dakota: Latin Jazz Series. What a fine way to approach summer’s end: with sequential nights of hot Latin jazz. Tonight, Nachito Herrera , one of the great Cuban pianists, will perform with a 13-member ensemble of players and singers borrowed from Buena Vista Social Club, Afro-Cuban All-Stars, Cubanismo, Los Van Van and other major bands. On Friday, Cuban pianist and Montreux Jazz Festival Solo Piano Competition winner Marialy Pacheco will play with her trio, with Yunior Terry on bass and Francisco Mela on drums. And on Saturday, Latin jazz giant Eddie Palmieri will make his Dakota debut. FMI including times and links to tickets ($25-50).
Friday at the Film Society’s St. Anthony Main Theatre 3: “Luce.” Based on a play by J.C. Lee, directed by Julius Onah (who co-wrote the screenplay with Lee), this psychological thriller explores race and identity in today’s America. Adopted as a young boy from war-torn Eritrea, Luce (Kelvin Harrison Jr.) is a star student and a poster boy for the new American Dream – until his teacher (Octavia Spencer) makes a shocking discovery in his locker. Naomi Watts and Tim Roth are Luce’s parents. There’s been some discussion about whether the film is too play-like; the New York Times wrote, “To say that it unfolds like a play is both accurate and undersells how gorgeously it has been rendered for the screen.” FMI including trailer, times and tickets.
Friday and Saturday at the Cedar: Mother Goose’s Bedtime Stories 2-Year Anniversary Show. An eclectic cabaret of music, words, and dance; a celebration and intersection of black, brown, indigenous, queer, gay, lesbian, intersex, transgender, non-binary, pansexual and bisexual people and womxn. Curated by Xochi de la Luna, produced by Uproar Performing Arts in collaboration with Pangea World Theater, it will be part showcase, part variety show and part theatrical production, with multidisciplinary performers and a house band. 7 p.m. doors, 8 p.m. show. FMI and tickets ($10-5 sliding scale).

Donald Trump is not losing it

Texto completo: For the past week or so, we've noticed a crescendo of commentary about whether Donald Trump is actually losing it. Rick Wilson offered up one example in the New York Daily News: "Red warning lights are flashing across Washington as even the now-typical levels of uncertainty and political chaos reach epic proportions. My Washington Post colleague Megan McArdle offered up another one: "This is not normal. And I don't mean that as in, Trump is violating the shibboleths of the Washington establishment.' I mean that as in, This is not normal for a functioning adult.'
This theme of the week is surprising, given the political roller-coaster ride Trump has forced us all to partake in. The president canceled a trip to Denmark in a fit of pique over not being able to buy Greenland. Consider the first few paragraphs of The Post's story on this decision:
"President Trump on Tuesday abruptly called off a trip to Denmark, announcing in a tweet that he was postponing the visit because the country's leader was not interested in selling him Greenland.
"The move comes two days after Trump told reporters that owning Greenland, a self-governing country that is part of the kingdom of Denmark, "would be nice for the United States from a strategic perspective.
Try to imagine any other president or putative president who could generate that opening in a straight news story.
The Atlantic's James Fallows explores the past few weeks of Trump's behavior - and finds it more than a little disturbing:
"These are episodes of what would be called outright lunacy, if they occurred in any other setting: An actually consequential rift with a small but important NATO ally, arising from the idea that the U.S. would buy Greenland.' Trump's self-description as the Chosen One,' and his embrace of a supporter's description of him as the second coming of God' and the King of Israel.' His logorrhea, drift, and fantastical claims in public rallies, and his flashes of belligerence at the slightest challenge in question sessions on the White House lawn. His utter lack of affect or empathy when personally meeting the most recent shooting victims, in Dayton and El Paso. His reduction of any event, whatsoever, into what people are saying about him.
Fallows concludes that in most other professions, Trump would already have been suspended from his job.
Indeed, there has been so much commentary about Trump's worsening state that folks such as CNN's Brian Stelter simply take it as a given and fret about why the media is not covering it properly.
And all of the above took place before Axios's Jonathan Swan and Margaret Talev broke the story about Trump wanting to nuke hurricanes.
The social scientist in me who has been observing Trump like this for his entire administration has a slightly contrarian note to make: This month provides little evidence that Trump is getting worse.
I ground this assertion on two empirical claims. The first is that Trump has had many months like this during his presidency. There have been multiple stretches in which a concatenation of blunders, bombshells and buffoonery have sent Trump careening from one toddler-like state to another. Consider:
Trump having a bad month is nothing new. Nor are the claims of cognitive decline, which have been around as long as his presidency. MSNBC host Joe Scarborough suggested back in November 2017 that the president is suffering from dementia. Omarosa Manigault Newman claimed the White House staff has kept Trump's deteriorating mental status a secret: "They continue to deceive this nation by how mentally declined he is. How difficult it is for him to process complex information. How he is not engaged in some of the most important decisions that impact our country.
Here's the big secret: Trump has not declined as president because that would imply there was a better time when this president possessed more of his wits. As long as he has been the commander in chief, he has displayed temper tantrums, poor impulse control, a short attention span and massive knowledge deficits. This month ain't new; it's just a particularly concentrated form of this behavior on public display.
That is not to say that nothing is new in the Trump White House. The New York Times's Peter Baker and Maggie Haberman got at this with a recent story:
"Some former Trump administration officials in recent days said they were increasingly worried about the president's behavior, suggesting it stems from rising pressure on Mr. Trump as the economy seems more worrisome and next year's election approaches.
"After casting off advisers who displeased him at a record rate in his first two and a half years in office, Mr. Trump now has fewer aides around him willing or able to challenge him, much less restrain his more impulsive instincts.
Trump is who he always is. What is different is what is happening around him. The economic and political environment is worsening for him, and he has no idea how to cope with it. Furthermore, Trump's burn rate on staff has been so high that he is scraping the bottom of the bottom of the barrel. His current dregs are so sycophantic they release statements no self-respecting communications professional would ever say.
There are excellent reasons to be worried about Trump's behavior through 2020. The cognitive decline of the president is not one of those reasons. Rather, it is that the benign environment and support structures that restrained Trump's worst impulses are gone.

Leonard Pitts: Trump’s anti-journalism hit squad

Texto completo: “The first thing we do, let’s kill all the lawyers.”
So says Dick the Butcher in Shakespeare's "Henry VI, Part 2." Though often regarded as a Renaissance-era lawyer joke, the line is actually a backhanded compliment to the legal profession. Dick, a follower of the rebel Jack Cade, knows that before their insurrection can succeed, they have to get rid of the defenders of law and order.
We are seeing a disturbingly similar strategy unfold in American politics. Except that this time, they want to kill all the journalists.
The 2018 massacre at a newsroom in Annapolis and ongoing violence and threats against reporters make the analogy a rather sensitive one, so let’s emphasize that it’s only that — analogy. The people we’re talking about aren’t actually out to kill journalists, just their credibility.
Tom Wright-Piersanti is the latest victim. According to a report in Sunday's New York Times, Wright-Piersanti, a Times editor, was targeted by "a loose network of conservative operatives allied with the White House." Their aim: Discredit news organizations they consider hostile to Donald Trump. Their strategy: posting damaging or embarrassing information about journalists.
So last week, after the Times ran two pieces unflattering to the Trump White House, this group unveiled on Breitbart some racist and anti-Semitic tweets Wright-Piersanti wrote 10 years ago. He has apologized and expressed "deep shame" for "lame attempts at edgy humor" — and also, in essence, for being a millennial.
"For my generation, the generation that came of age in the internet," he said, "all the youthful mistakes that you made get preserved in digital amber, and no matter how much you change and mature and grow up, it's always out there, waiting to be discovered." The Times said it was looking into what it dubbed "a clear violation of our standards."
One need not condone Wright-Piersanti's old tweets to note that whatever offensive thing he said, he said 10 years ago when he was in college. The last offensive thing Trump said was less than 10 days ago, and he is in the White House.
But there is far more at stake here than one man's career. A president who has branded journalists "enemies of the people" and news media "an evil propaganda machine" now has working on his behalf an anti-journalism hit squad. These people are nothing less than termites in the woodwork of freedom.
Beyond Wright-Piersanti, they're also said to have targeted reporters from The Washington Post, Business Insider and CNN. Like him, most were in their teens or early 20s when they penned the offensive posts. Arthur Schwartz, a conservative political consultant and friend of Donald Trump Jr., described by The Times as a central figure in the campaign, says it has only just begun. The group claims to have done deep dives into the digital histories of numerous journalists — and their family members.
"Lots more where that came from," he tweeted last week.
To which journalism as an institution must respond: Bring it.
Yes, some people may be embarrassed, some careers damaged. But bring it. Because truth itself is facing a hostile takeover. Because the machinery of authoritarianism is being assembled before our eyes. Because the people's right to know is sacred. And because without an informed electorate, democracy is not possible.
See, this group understands what Dick the Butcher did not. The first thing you do is "kill" not the lawyers, but the reporters.
Then you can do whatever you want to the lawyers, and no one will even know.

WASHINGTON - Struggling Democratic presidential candidates are facing the bad news that they are not among the 10 who have qualified for the next debate, a predicament that is likely to spell doom for their campaigns.
Hours ahead of a midnight Wednesday deadline to qualify, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand announced she was dropping out of the race after spending at least $4 million on advertising in recent months to qualify.
Billionaire climate change activist Tom Steyer, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock and self-help guru Marianne Williamson were also among those missing September's debate, as were Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and a handful of others.
To appear on stage in Houston next month, they had to hit 2% in at least four approved public opinion polls while securing 130,000 unique donors. Two new polls released Wednesday affirmed that they were all below the threshold.
The question shifted from who would qualify for the following debate to who would stay in the race.
"Our rules have ended up less inclusive  than even the Republicans," Bullock said on MSNBC, referring to the thresholds set by the Democratic National Committee. "It is what it is."
The 10 candidates who qualified for September's debate are Joe Biden, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, Julian Castro, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Beto O'Rourke, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Andrew Yang.
OxyContin maker negotiating
$12B settlement
COLUMBUS, Ohio - Purdue Pharma would devote its profits to cleaning up the devastation wrought by opioids, and the controlling Sackler family would be out, under a $10 billion to $12 billion nationwide settlement taking shape at the negotiating table, according to published reports Wednesday.
The agreement, if it comes to pass, would resolve more than 2,000 lawsuits brought against the maker of OxyContin by state and local governments.
Under the proposal on the table, Purdue Pharma would file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and transform itself into a "public benefit trust corporation," with all profits from drug sales and other proceeds going to the plaintiffs, news reports said, citing a document outlining the tentative agreement.
The Wall Street Journal said the arrangement would stay in place for seven to 10 years and would be overseen by trustees named by the bankruptcy court. Details of the proposed settlement were also reported by NBC and The New York Times.
The Sacklers would give up ownership of Purdue Pharma and contribute $3 billion of their own money toward the total, the reports said. They would also sell another pharmaceutical company, Mundipharma, which would add $1.5 billion to the settlement.
In addition, Purdue Pharma would supply its addiction treatment drugs free to the public.

'Deportation .&#xa0;.&#xa0;. with this type of medical condition is a death sentence': Outrage grows over federal policy change

Texto completo: A new Trump administration policy to deport families of seriously ill children receiving treatment in the United States provoked fresh outrage this week, as health care providers feared for their patients, elected officials demanded oversight, and advocates planned lawsuits to stop the action.
Senators Edward J. Markey and Elizabeth Warren and Representative Ayanna Pressley said Thursday that they will send a letter to the administration demanding internal documents on its decision to suddenly end what's known as “deferred action" — a policy that allows some immigrants to remain in the United States legally while they receive medical care for complex conditions.
Lawyers for some of the immigrants said Monday that US Citizenship and Immigration Services has begun informing families that it no longer considers requests for deferred action, and that the families must leave the country within 33 days. The change applies to children and adults with cancer, cystic fibrosis, HIV, epilepsy, and other diseases.
The policy change came as a surprise to patients, caregivers, lawmakers, and some federal officials, with no formal announcement.
“It is absolutely immoral to be deporting children with cancer," Markey said Thursday. “We cannot and will not allow this to stand."
Critics called the decision a new low for an administration that has aggressively targeted immigrants.
“Deportation from the United States with this type of medical condition is a death sentence," Pressley said.
She and Representative Judy Chu of California also called for congressional oversight of the administration's decision.
Massachusetts' prestigious hospitals draw many patients from around the globe. Immigration lawyers estimate that at least 40 families in the state are vulnerable to the change in policy — with thousands affected nationally, said Mahsa Khanbabai,who chairs the New England chapter of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.
Nationwide, about 1,000 people per year request deferred action for medical and other humanitarian reasons, according to the association.
Meanwhile, the change appeared to stir confusion among federal agencies. Officials at US Citizenship and Immigration Service, which has been notifying affected families, said the responsibility now falls to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE. Neither agency responded to requests for comment Thursday, but according to published reports and immigration attorneys, ICE officials appeared blindsided by the move.
“The agencies haven't talked to each other," Khanbabai said. “This is a haphazard attempt to try to create more fear and confusion."
It's unclear if the families told to leave the country would even be able to do so. Khanbabai said she has two clients who are in no position to return to their home countries: one young man is hospitalized for a mental illness, and the other, a 14-year-old girl, needs ongoing treatment at Boston Children's Hospital for a complex heart condition.
The change in the deferred action program is one of many steps the Trump administration has taken to tighten immigration. The New York Times reported that in a separate action, the administration was clamping down on a special protective visa, known as the U visa, that allows crime victims who have helped law enforcement authorities with investigations to stay in the United States.
The policy change for sick immigrants drew a rebuke from Democratic candidates for president, including Warren, who called it “heartless," and former vice president Joe Biden.
“There is no national security justification for further traumatizing sick kids at their most vulnerable," Biden said on Twitter. “Like all bullies, Trump is purposefully targeting the little guys — but I would have thought even he would understand that kids with cancer and cystic fibrosis were off-limits."
Markey tweeted that ICE officials told his staff they would force the affected families to go through deportation proceedings before deciding their fate, which he called “dehumanizing," while immigration lawyers called it a grueling and unworkable option for people receiving medical treatment.
Legal groups are considering litigation to try to halt the policy change.
“The ACLU will fight to protect these sick children and their families, and to hold this administration to account. Every option is on the table, and we're currently exploring litigation options," Carol Rose, executive director of the ACLU of Massachusetts, said in a statement Thursday.
Children's Hospital officials said in a statement that they are deeply concerned about the policy change.
“We are encouraged by the visibility that has been generated by the many advocates who share our concern," hospital officials said. “We are hopeful that their advocacy on behalf of children will result in a reversal of this policy."
Boston Medical Center officials said in a statement that they “oppose any actions that could prevent people from accessing the health care they need."
Dr. Fiona Danaher, a pediatrician at Mass. General's clinic in Chelsea, said 33 days is not nearly enough to plan the transfer of a patient overseas. And for some children, the treatment or equipment they need — such as breathing and feeding tubes — may not be available in their home countries.
“This administration has been taking many steps to undermine the health of immigrant children, and this is just the latest," she said. “It's appalling."

Conductor steps onto world stage; Berlin Philharmonic chose Kirill Petrenko for the job. In concert, he makes it clear why.

Texto completo: There is so much being made about the mystique of Kirill Petrenko, the seemingly otherworldly 47-year-old conductor from Siberia who began his tenure as Berlin Philharmonic music director last weekend, that it hardly seems like mystique at all anymore. The fact that he does not sell himself has been made a selling point. The New York Times has dubbed him the anti-anti-maestro (does that make a maestro?).
He shies away from interviews and is said to be truly shy, a rare and you would think undesirable trait for a conductor. He is also said to leave his ego, if he even has one, at the stage door. Again, it is said (everything comes second hand with Petrenko), that rather than genuflect before the greatest orchestral machine the world has ever known, as many a maestoso maestro has for the most sought-after job in the profession, Petrenko was genuinely surprised to have been selected by the players, who pick their music director themselves.
So was the music world. Petrenko had never before headed an orchestra, only opera companies and only one big one, Bavarian State Opera in Munich, where he remains for two more seasons. He is a perfectionist uneasy with recordings, of which he's made few, yet he heads an orchestra that has long been a leader in audio and video recording and now concert streaming with its outstanding Digital Concert Hall. Petrenko, say those who know him and love him (that seems to go hand in hand), has music for breakfast, lunch, dinner and a nightcap.

After hearing Petrenko bring his Berlin Philharmonic to the Salzburg Festival, after it performed Beethoven's Ninth Symphony in Berlin's Philharmonie and in a free outdoor concert in front of the Brandenburg Gate for 20,000, I'm not so sure I buy the mystique business. The ego issue is clearly complicated. But his two concerts in the Festspielhaus in Salzburg, the first a repeat of the Beethoven Ninth and second featuring a performance of Schoenberg's Violin Concerto with Patricia Kopatchinskaja of speechless greatness, left no doubt about just how special Petrenko is. He is a small man with a black beard from Omsk, Siberia, a town known for its munitions industries, petrochemical plants and freezing winters. At 17 he immigrated with his family to Germany and went on to study in Vienna. He worked his way up through German opera companies, first in Meiningen, then at the Komische Oper Berlin (where he happened by to succeeded by Pacific Symphony Music Director Carl St.Clair) and then in Munich (where he followed two other SoCal notables, Zubin Mehta and Kent Nagano).
Although he has had little exposure in the U.S., Petrenko did conduct the Los Angeles Philharmonic at the Hollywood Bowl a dozen years ago in an all-Russian program. He didn't make much of an impression. (The Bowl, with its minimal rehearsal schedule, seems about the worst place possible for this meticulous anti-anti-maestro.) For that matter he only conducted the Berlin Philharmonic a few times before the 2015 announcement that he would succeed Simon Rattle.
On paper it looks as though Petrenko will not continue Rattle's 16-year effort to bring the Berliners into the 21st century, an effort that included making John Adams a composer in residence and inviting Peter Sellars to stage Bach passions. Petrenko will make limited appearances this year, giving prominence to Beethoven, Mahler and standard Russian repertory. There is little new or even unusual. But we shouldn't be too fast to draw conclusions about a Petrenko we barely know. Before the Beethoven Ninth on Sunday, Petrenko programmed Berg's suite from his sexually provocative opera, "Lulu," which ends with the grisly sounds of Lulu being killed by Jack the Ripper in London. It was just a coincidence, maybe, but a month earlier Brexit party officials turned their backs on the playing of "Ode to Joy" from Beethoven's Ninth, because it is the anthem of the European Union. There was no coincidence here. Petrenko understood that an ode to joy is never without doubt.
On this occasion, "Lulu," which featured soprano Marlis Petersen, had a sad and sensual, but never sensational, quality. Petrenko conducted with a beatific look on his face, a warm smile, Dalai Lama-like, showing not so much happiness but serenity, even in the face of doubt and tragedy. Yes, of course, Petrenko has an ego, and surely a tremendous one. You don't control the huge 100-plus egos that make up this phenomenal orchestra by chance. But what might makes him unique among conductors is the way Petrenko uses his ego to transcend it.
Rather than demonstrating Beethoven's extraordinary capacity to manufacture joy out of nothingness in the Ninth, for instance, Petrenko was more like the great Sufi singer Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. He waved his arms, like he were dancing, as Khan did when he sang. In a fast and dazzlingly virtuosic performance that lasted barely over an hour, Petrenko seemed like he was after a spiritual awakening to the joy that is the dance of the cosmos.
The symphony zipped by, without our attention directed to the obvious big moments, as if Petrenko didn't want to tell the listener how to think. There was, though, just enough rapture and climax to indicate that something out there just beyond your grasp. That second sense kept building and building, without you quite realizing how and why, no matter the familiarity of the material. By the end of the buildup, you found out what a hypnotic performance this had been all along, that joy was a concord to be felt by all.
The next night was the same but also a very different Petrenko, because the music was different. For the Schoenberg concerto, written in the 1930s when the composer taught at UCLA, Petrenko gave up his ego to his inspired soloist. This can seem dauntingly complex music, but Kopatchinskaja breathed new and unexpected life into every phrase. This time, it was not the cosmos the listener was transported into but Schoenberg's psyche, in which each fleeting thought, each neuron fired, proved a theatrical event. The concord of chaotic mental states, it turns out, can be an even greater revelation.
Next to this concerto, Tchaikovsky's fate-bemoaning Fifth Symphony can seem transparent and manipulative. Yet in a hugely dramatic and probing performance, Petrenko created surprising depth. He dug beyond the oppressive ego of Tchaikovsky, beyond indulgent melodrama, beyond the showoff insecurities.
Here Petrenko was not fast but slow, so slow that Tchaikovskian pathos lost its pretense. Here Petrenko's tool was power, and climaxes were ear-shattering. Here the Berliners' playing was of such beauty and passion and perfection that Tchaikovsky had no place for subterfuge. Here was Petrenko placing his ego not at Tchaikovsky's disposal but ours, showing us how to hear beyond the superficial into our deepest being.

Thirty Shows, One Intern. Discount Her In.

Texto completo: My boss at The New York Times suggested two shows I had to see this summer: "The Ferryman" and "My Fair Lady."
I saw 30.
In 10 weeks as an editing intern, I mainlined more plays, musicals, ballets and cabaret performances than many people see in their entire lives.
In between fine-tuning stories for the White House correspondent Maggie Haberman or the New York Yankees beat writer James Wagner, I spent my nights nestled in Broadway theaters.
I watched an 83-year-old Glenda Jackson unleash the guttural growls of a death metal singer as King Lear. I saw the Hogwarts recruits of "Harry Potter and the Cursed Child" stagger across the stage, wands aloft, as though dragged by a cat skidding across a just-waxed floor.
A day after the death of the original "Phantom of the Opera" director Hal Prince, I witnessed Sierra Boggess deliver a rendition of "Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again" at Feinstein's/54 Below, a performance so raw that it nearly broke my heart (and hers, it looked like).
For the record, I am not rich. I'm about to start the final year of my master's degree in English at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis, with a year's worth of apartment rent and tuition to match. And while my Times internship was paid, I certainly wasn't making Bill Gates money.
But I never spent more than $ 70 for a show this summer -- with two exceptions, for "Cursed Child" and "Phantom," my favorite musical. And most of my tickets cost $ 40 or less.
I lined up at box offices first thing in the morning -- a few times after getting home after 1 a.m. from night shifts -- for rush tickets, which are steeply discounted seats sold at the theater the morning of a performance. I bought standing-room tickets for "Chicago" and "Come From Away." I saw all the free shows I could (looking at you, Shakespeare in the Park).
I won four lotteries for discounted (often front-row) seats -- but never for "Hamilton," despite 80 tries.
Two shows were free, thanks to tagging along with the Times theater critics Ben Brantley and Laura Collins-Hughes. I scored cheap student tickets to "My Fair Lady," "Ink," "All My Sons" and "Fairview," and a $ 12 seat for the American Ballet Theater's production of "Jane Eyre." (Thank you Linctix, Manhattan Theater Club, Hiptix, Theater for a New Audience New Deal and the Met Opera Students program.)
For 10 weeks, I made a game out of trying to cram in as many shows as possible while putting The Times first. But theatergoing grew more challenging when I started working nights. Fortunately, I had a theater-loving boss, who even rearranged my final week's schedule so I could see the "Phantom of the Opera" matinee.
And while I couldn't afford to see the shows featuring every big-name actor in town, I could meet them at the stage door after a performance. I watched Adam Driver, Kylo Ren-like all in black, bring an entire street to a standstill after "Burn This." I came this close to getting a "Size XL" sticker on the front of Jeff Daniels's new T-shirt stuck to the front of my Playbill at "To Kill a Mockingbird." And my middle-school self's dreams came true when I took a photo with Corbin Bleu after "Kiss Me, Kate."
But why? I'm not an aspiring actress. I didn't do high-school theater. I couldn't have told you who Audra McDonald was four years ago, much less what she was famous for. To be honest, I'd have been hard-pressed to tell you the difference between a play and a musical.
But a two-month study abroad trip to London in 2016 catapulted me into the world of the West End, and I've attended more than 150 shows in Indianapolis, and now New York, in the three years since.
What gripped me then, and now, is the storytelling. As a journalist, my goal is to write immersively; to leave you so absorbed in a story that you forget you're reading words on a page.
A standout theatrical production accomplishes the same. In the title role of "Dear Evan Hansen," Andrew Barth Feldman made me forget where I was, who I was, that I was anything other than part of the world onstage -- the mark of truly magical theater. I'm pretty sure I didn't draw breath the entire first act.
A highlight of my stage binge was attending "The Black Clown," a music-theater adaptation of Langston Hughes's 1931 poem, with Mr. Brantley, The Times's co-chief theater critic. I watched him take a few, mostly illegible, notes in a miniature composition notebook from Staples, then write a review that read as though he'd had the script in hand and a recording of the production saved in his Netflix library to replay scenes at will.
It was an affirmation penned almost entirely from memory, one that dripped with both passionate appreciation and meticulous detail. I was astounded.
Of course, not every show I saw this summer won me over.
I wasn't a fan of the Tony darling "The Ferryman." And I found the unconvincing fight choreography and clichéd plot of "Be More Chill" exasperating, which was especially disappointing given my expectations after listening to George Salazar's "Michael in the Bathroom" on the cast recording for months.
Going to so many shows in such a short period of time underscored the reality that while the majority of Broadway productions are good and worth seeing, the truly great shows are rare, and the atrocious ones even rarer.
A show may have stellar actors, but a slog of a script, or moving orchestrations paired with cheesy lyrics. The best Broadway shows are a marriage of form and performance, of a tightly coiled plot that unfolds at exactly the right pace and actors who render you unable to view them in any light except the one they embody onstage.
"We think you're going to be pretty bored when you return to Indy," my mom texted me at the end of July.
I'm not so sure.
But that's not to say I don't need to come back to New York. Jesse Green, The Times's other chief theater critic, has invited me to attend a show with him when I return. And I still need to see the Rockettes.
Plus I have a "Hamilton" lottery to win. (I have to win eventually, right? Right?)

Texto completo: President Trump mocked New York Times columnist Bret Stephens, who quit Twitter after taking offense to a man calling him a bedbug, claiming Stephens was responsible for the bedbugs recently found in the newsroom.
Trump said the bedbugs were “perhaps brought in by lightweight journalist Bret Stephens, a Conservative who does anything that his bosses at the paper tell him to do!”
“He is now quitting Twitter after being called a ‘bedbug.' Tough guy!” Trump tweeted Wednesday.
Tweet
In a memo to staff on Monday, the New York Times said it had “discovered evidence of bedbugs” on three floors and the affected areas had been treated and professionally cleaned.
David Karpf, a George Washington University professor, then joked on Twitter that the bedbugs were a metaphor for Stephens. Karpf said Stephens emailed him and the university provost to complain about the tweet.
The columnist was widely mocked for the action, leading him to deactivate his Twitter account. He then appeared on cable news to address the controversy, saying the bedbug comment was “dehumanizing rhetoric.”

Texto completo: The New York Times has begun a major initiative, the "1619 Project," to observe the 400th anniversary of the beginning of American slavery. It aims to reframe American history so that slavery and the contributions of black Americans explain who we are as a nation.
Nikole Hannah-Jones, staff writer for The New York Times Magazine wrote the lead article, "America Wasn’t a Democracy, Until Black Americans Made It One." She writes, "Without the idealistic, strenuous and patriotic efforts of black Americans, our democracy today would most likely look very different — it might not be a democracy at all." There are several challenges one can make about Hannah-Jones’ article, but I’m going to focus on the article’s most serious error, namely that the nation’s founders intended for us to be a democracy. That error is shared by too many Americans. The word democracy appears nowhere in the two most fundamental founding documents of our nation — the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution. Instead of a democracy, the Constitution’s Article IV, Section 4, declares, "The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government."
The founders had utter contempt for democracy. James Madison, the acknowledged father of the Constitution, wrote in Federalist Paper No. 10, that in a pure democracy "there is nothing to check the inducement to sacrifice the weaker party or the obnoxious individual." At the 1787 Constitutional Convention, delegate Edmund Randolph said, "that in tracing these evils to their origin every man had found it in the turbulence and follies of democracy."
The U.S. Constitution is replete with anti-majority rule, undemocratic provisions. One provision, heavily criticized, is the Electoral College. In their wisdom, the framers gave us the Electoral College so that in presidential elections, heavily populated states could not run roughshod over sparsely populated states. In order to amend the Constitution, it requires a two-thirds vote of both Houses, or two-thirds of state legislatures, to propose an amendment, and requires three-fourths of state legislatures for ratification.
In addition to not understanding our Constitution, Hannah-Jones’ article, like in most discussions of black history, fails to acknowledge that black Americans have made the greatest gains, over some of the highest hurdles in the shortest span of time than any other racial group in mankind’s history. The evidence: If black Americans were thought of as a nation with our own gross domestic product, we’d rank among the 20 wealthiest nations. It was a black American, Gen. Colin Powell, who headed the world’s mightiest military. A few black Americans are among the world’s wealthiest. Black Americans are among the world’s most famous personalities.
In 1865, neither a slave nor a slave owner would have believed that such progress would be possible in less than a century and a half, if ever. As such, it speaks to the intestinal fortitude of a people. Just as importantly, it speaks to the greatness of a nation within which such progress was possible, progress that would have been impossible anywhere else. The challenge before us is how those gains can be extended to a large percentage of black people for whom they appear elusive.

Texto completo: SPRINGFIELD — Illinois is taking steps to combat troubling maternal and infant mortality statistics after one lawmaker was moved to action by a series of reports which showcased the state’s and country’s maternal health shortcomings, particularly among African-American women.
The lawmaker is Chicago Democrat Mary Flowers. The troubling statistics: Pregnancy-related complications kill more mothers in the United States than in any other developed country, and African-American mothers die at three to four times the rate of white mothers.
"What is happening and what has been happening is truly unacceptable," Flowers said. "I can only go back to the articles that I read about the unconscious bias and untreated conditions and unrecognized factors that lead to poor outcomes when it comes down to African-American women and women of childbearing age. It’s unacceptable."
Last week, Gov. J.B. Pritzker signed the last bills from a package of new laws to create new maternal legal rights and a task force to study the high death rate among African-American mothers and babies, to force hospitals to collect more accurate data on maternal mortality and be better equipped to treat pregnant women, and to mandate proper training for medical staff that are likely to treat pregnant women.
Troubling Statistics The U.S. weakness in maternal health care was detailed in a 2017 study by National Public Radio and ProPublica which showed 26.4 of each 100,000 mothers in the U.S. died from pregnancy-related complications in 2015, while the next closest developed country was the United Kingdom with 9.2 per 100,000.
The racial disparities are driven home in a report by the Illinois Department of Public Health which said an average of 73 women in Illinois died each year from 2008 to 2016 within one year of pregnancy, and African-American women were six times more likely to die of a pregnancy-related condition during that span. According to the report, 72 percent of those deaths and 93 percent of violent pregnancy-associated deaths were preventable.
State Sen. Jacqueline Collins, a Chicago Democrat and Senate sponsor of several of Flowers’ maternal health care measures, said the disparities existed across income and education levels.
"We found that a lot of highly educated black women in high paying careers are more likely to die as a consequence of childbirth than a white woman without even a high school diploma," she said.
Flowers said a 2018 New York Times Magazine article which also caught her attention detailed that, in the U.S., African-American infants were more than twice as likely to die than white infants, at 11.3 deaths per 1,000 babies and 4.9 deaths per 1,000 babies, respectively.
While infant deaths have decreased to 30 times less than what they were in 1850 for African-American babies, the number decreased by 44 times for white babies, making the disparity between the races even larger today than it was during that pre-Civil War era.
"That was more than a decade before the abolishment of slavery," Flowers said. "Now, that tells me there’s some real problems here in the United States."
Collecting Accurate Data In response to the reports, Flowers called two committee hearings last year which she said brought forth further revelations.
Her committee heard testimony about poor hospital funding and readiness to handle childbirth in certain communities, obstacles to continuity of care and poor documentation of preexisting conditions for people with low incomes, and systemic bias and racism in the medical profession which leads to stress on patients and their health concerns sometimes being ignored by doctors.
"Doctors testified to racism, and they also testified to implicit bias and all other kinds of problems that needed to be addressed as well as training," she said. "And we know that more women are dying from something as simple as hemorrhaging, and it’s not being addressed."
To look further into the driving forces of maternal and infant mortality rates, Flowers sponsored and unanimously passed House Bill 1, which was signed by the governor in July to create the Task Force on Infant and Maternal Mortality Among African Americans.
The task force will be comprised of state health officials, doctors, midwives and medical professionals, hospital and insurance leaders, community experts in infant and maternal health, and an African-American woman who has experienced a traumatic pregnancy.
The task force will meet quarterly and report findings to the General Assembly by Dec. 1, 2020, on the causes and rates of maternal death and ways to improve the quality and safety of maternity care.
"It’s been well known in African-American communities that there were certain disparities in care and how doctors perceive our pain, but we never had the data to back it up, or to make that determination," Collins said. "And so this is really getting at it."
Another measure, House Bill 3, requires hospitals to include in each of their state-mandated quarterly reports any instances of preterm infants, infant mortality and maternal mortality, and the racial and ethnic information of the mothers in those instances.
Collins said accurate data is necessary to more clearly define the problem in Illinois, and "just to put the issue on the radar screen."
"We want to hold hospitals accountable so we can have accurate data and gauge the scope of this problem," she said. "This task force will focus on a data-driven approach to crafting policy."
Maternal Rights House Bill 2 is another unanimously-passed bill in the maternal mortality package, and it adds 19 new rights for pregnant women to the Medical Patient Rights Act. The Act was established in the 1990s, laying out rights for medical patients that, if violated by a health care provider or insurance company, can result in a fine ranging from $500 to $1,000.
House Bill 2 adds to that act, giving a woman the right to receive health care for herself and her baby before, during and after childbirth, to be treated with respect at all times, to contact with her baby when medically possible, and to refuse any treatment to the extent medically possible.
A woman also has the right to choose a certified nurse midwife or physician as her maternity care professional, to seek different caregivers if they are unsatisfied, to know the names of those providing her care, and to receive information about her condition and possible treatments.
Women also have the right to receive medical information in a language they understand, and to receive information about breastfeeding.
As well, a woman can choose her birth setting from a full range of options in her community, be informed if caregivers enter her or her baby in a research study, and has a right to give birth in the position of her choice within generally accepted medical standards.
"These rights show that a woman is to be respected," Flowers said.
The bill also gives a right to privacy and confidentiality, emotional and physical support during childbirth, and the ability for a mother to decide collaboratively with caregivers when she and her baby will leave the birth site.
Finally, women have the right, regardless of how they are paying for their stay, to receive an explanation of the total bill for services, including itemized charges for specific services received as part of her maternity care.
"We know that patients have rights, but it’s unfortunate that we need to enumerate them, the kind of rights that should be so basic, and universally understood," Collins said.
Other Measures Another of the bills which received unanimous approval, House Bill 5, directs the Department of Human Services to ensure pregnant and postpartum mothers have access to substance use disorder services that are gender-responsive and trauma-informed.
House Bill 2433, which passed 56-0 in the Senate and 111-2 in the House, requires every hospital to have the proper instruments available to take a pregnant woman’s blood pressure.
House Bill 2438, which also passed unanimously, amends the insurance code to require insurers to cover any mental health condition that occurs during pregnancy or during the postpartum period.
House Bill 2895, which passed the House 109-2 and the Senate 55-0, requires all birthing facilities to conduct continuing education yearly for all staff that may care for pregnant or postpartum women. That training must include modules on management of severe maternal hypertension and hemorrhaging.

Texto completo: Are you a political junkie? A social justice devotee? A futurist? A fun seeker? Cap Times Idea Fest has got you covered.
This is the third year of the festival. Our aim in 2017 was to create an event worthy of any Madison calendar of notable events, and we think this year's just-completed program proves we've arrived.
The festival builds on our mission: to help our readers understand the most important topics, challenges and opportunities shaping their lives here by listening, investigating, explaining and hosting lively community events that celebrate what makes us special.
For you, it provides a unique opportunity for an in-person experience to be informed, entertained and surprised by our more than two dozen sessions in and around the University of Wisconsin Memorial Union. This year's festival is Sept. 13 and 14 Friday night and Saturday. (We checked: It's a bye week for Wisconsin football.) Instead of just reciting aggregated highlights, here is how we think the festival will appeal to six audience segments, though we suspect many of you will be interested in several.
The political junkie
Predictably, there's plenty here.
? Our Friday night keynoter is Eric Holder, the former U.S. attorney general who now chairs the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, which focuses on election gerrymandering and voting rights.
? Is there a political center? That is the question Scott Klug, our former GOP congressman, will explore as he moderates a national panel of former elected officials and analysts.
? U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson and former Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch, both Wisconsin Republicans, will be featured in one-onone sessions.
? Top-notch Washington Post journalists Carol Leonnig, Alexandra Petri and Catherine Rampell will discuss the Trump era and the 2020 political landscape.
? The moderator of that session will be Post associate editor and Cap Times friend David Maraniss, who will also moderate a conversation with Joaquin Castro, a San Antonio congressman and House Intelligence Committee member, about immigration and other topics.
? We'll also focus on Wisconsin politics in 2020 in a panel that features noted pollster Charles Franklin among others.
The social justice devotee
? Esteemed UW-Madison professor Armando Ibarra has organized a powerful panel on how Latinos in Wisconsin are organizing to push back against white nationalist and anti-immigrant agendas.
? We'll explore what comes next on youth justice as Wisconsin closes its large youth prisons and replaces them with smaller, county-run facilities and how that relates to alternatives to incarceration.
? Paul Higginbotham, who, before he retired, was Wisconsin's only African American Appeals Court judge, will talk about what needs to happen to make the state's legal system more fair.
? We also have an arts panel exploring the question: How can theater be more inclusive?
The techie
? Madison has plenty of gatherings for tech insiders, but Idea Fest presents macro trends for a general audience, most prominently through the appearance of Judy Faulkner, the CEO and founder of Epic. The health care information technology giant she created decades ago has fueled the growth of Madison's thriving tech sector.
? We'll explore whether Madison can supercharge its economy rivaling cities like Seattle and Austin with other health care technology through a panel discussion with local start-up executives organized by the venture capital group HealthX Ventures.
The futurist
? An outstanding panel of local leaders will explore the question: "How Does Madison Not Become Seattle?" That city has experienced severe issues with homelessness, skyrocketing housing costs and traffic gridlock in its growth over the past two decades. Urban League of Greater Madison President and CEO Ruben Anthony, Exact Sciences CEO Kevin Conroy, Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation head and former Seattle resident Eric Iverson and Madison Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway will speak.
? Noted agriculture journalist Pam Jahnke will host a panel on the future of family farms in Wisconsin.
? Another future-focused session is about improving public dialogue through the Local Voices Network project. Noted UW political scientist Kathy Cramer will speak and, after that talk, there will be unique opportunities for attendees to participate.
? Still another future-focused session is about media credibility and will include, among others, Farhad Manjoo, an op-ed writer for The New York Times.
? The Wisconsin Alumni Foundation is presenting a session on good news in the fight against Alzheimer's disease in a discussion featuring leading UW experts, including Dr. Cynthia Carlsson, the head of the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center.

Williams takes stardom in stride

Texto completo: Even before he was born, Hawaii defensive lineman Manly Williams would be known as “Pumba,” a phonetic nickname his older brother chose from “The Lion King.”
Growing up, Williams said, “the only people who called me Manly were my mom, my grandpa and my teachers.”
After collaborating with safety Kalen Hicks on a game-ending tackle to preserve the Rainbow Warriors’ 45-38 victory over Arizona on Saturday, Williams became a household name.
Several teams — including Clemson, Georgia, the San Francisco 49ers and the Buffalo Bills — used the video clip of Williams charging more than 30 yards downfield as an example of play-to-the-whistle hustle. After Tuesday’s practice, Williams did telephone interviews with The Athletic and the New York Times. Pat Forde of Yahoo! Sports declared that for the next week, college football’s top honor should be renamed the HeisManly Trophy.
Williams has emphatically credited his teammates for contributing to the play. He also said he did what he was coached to do. “Run to the ball,” Williams said. “I wasn’t really looking for any attention after the game. I just did what anybody else would do.”
With the clock ticking down, the Warriors were rotating defensive linemen as part of the “rushmen package.” In that sub-package, Williams was “in that second group after a kind of line change for us, like in hockey,” defensive coordinator Corey Batoon said. “They subbed and then we subbed.”
With 10 seconds remaining, Williams was one of two defensive ends to shift to defensive tackle, while the rush ends played the edges. Williams was instructed to loop into the backfield to seal quarterback Khalil Tate. “I was supposed to loop out, but I came too far infield, and (Tate) escaped inside,” Williams said. “And when I turned, I was, ‘Oh, this is the last play. I’d better start running.’ I started running after the ball. It was a team effort.”
Hicks grasped Tate at the 1, and Williams finished off the tackle.
Williams said he made a similar play five years earlier as a Farrington High safety. “I was 100 pounds lighter,” said Williams, who now weighs 275.
After Saturday’s nationally televised game had ended, Williams said, friends were “sending me all these messages that ‘You’re blowing up on Twitter,’ I don’t even have a Twitter account. I don’t even care. I have Instagram. I’d look at (the congratulatory messages), and tell everybody, ‘Thank you.’ ”
The following day, he went to breakfast with teammates Alema Kapoi and Azia Se‘ei. “I had a bacon-cheese-spinach omelet with rice,” Williams said.
Despite his recently bleached hair and internet notoriety, he went unnoticed.
“That’s good,” said Williams, who tries to avoid the spotlight. “I don’t like it too much. It’s not me. I’m a mellow guy. I keep to myself.”
The past May, Williams earned a bachelor’s degree in business management. “I like being interactive,” said Williams, who is pursuing a second degree in kinesiology. “Business management is just like football — how to lead, how to be an example, how to help a team or group to a common goal.”

Joe Biden to hold Park City campaign fundraiser with tickets going for $2,800 each

Texto completo: Former Vice President Joe Biden will be holding a private campaign fundraiser at a Park City home in late September, his first visit to Utah since announcing his 2020 presidential bid.
Tickets to the Sept. 28 breakfast range from $500 for a “friend” to $2,800 for a “sponsor,” according to the event page. Accompanying Biden will be former U.S. Ambassador Mark Gilbert, former Utah Democratic Party chairman Wayne Holland and John Cumming, the founder of Park City-based Powdr.
The reception will take place at the home of Amy and Barry Baker, longtime media executives who hosted Hillary Clinton during her 2016 presidential bid.
Barry Baker is the former president of USA Networks and is a senior adviser to Lee Equity Partners, a private equity and venture-capital firm. Amy Baker spent a couple decades at NBC News.
In a Tuesday phone interview, Amy Baker said she and her husband are throwing their support behind Biden in the Democratic primary because they believe he can defeat President Donald Trump.
"I also know what a well-intentioned person Vice President Biden is, and I just think this country needs kinder and gentler, as he is," Baker said.
Her Park City home has hosted the Clintons for several events over the years, accommodating about 350 guests for a Hillary Clinton fundraiser in 2015 and more than 150 guests a year later when Bill Clinton was in town rallying support for his wife, she said.
Biden is locked in a virtual three-way tie with Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren for the Democratic nomination, according to a national survey released Monday by Monmouth University Poll. The latest numbers represent a decline for Biden, who had been polling as the race’s front-runner.
The former vice president spoke at the University of Utah in December while on a tour promoting his memoir, “Promise Me, Dad: A Year of Hope, Hardship, and Purpose.” That was several months before the official start of his presidential campaign, but the book was interpreted by some as an indication that the longtime U.S. senator from Delaware would launch a Democratic bid for the nation’s highest office.
The University of Utah had agreed to pay Biden $100,000 to speak, but when the former vice president heard the money would come from state coffers, he declined the check, according to The New York Times.

Charles M. Blow: For Trump, everything is personal

Texto completo: For Donald Trump, all is personal.
And in his view, he is not the executive of the company. He is the embodiment of the country. He runs the country the way he ran his business, as the curating and promotion of his personal brand.
The people who support him are customers — people to be sold a vision and a dream. The people who criticize or oppose him threaten the brand and must be dealt with.
For Trump, everything is image-based and rooted in the appearance of personal relationships. When the Danish prime minister rebuffed his overture about buying Greenland, calling the idea “absurd,” Trump threw a tantrum and canceled his visit to Denmark.
Trump discussed the episode at one of his press gaggles, calling the prime minister’s response “nasty’ and saying, “We can’t treat the United States of America the way they treated us under President Obama.” He went on to say: “She’s not talking to me. She’s talking to the United States of America. You don’t talk to the United States that way, at least under me.”
No, actually, she was talking to him.
America was not being dismissed or disrespected. This proposal, which sounded like a joke, was being laughed at. And this president hates being laughed at.
Everything in Trump’s view is about whether someone is nice or nasty to him. It’s not about the country at all. It’s not about historical precedent or value of continuity.
His dislike of his predecessors — Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and even Jimmy Carter — is personal, not rooted in policy. He has a particular obsession with Obama, and has set about to undo everything Obama had done.
It’s petty and small and beneath the presidency, much like Trump himself.
I believe that Trump has had a long-standing belief about how China should be dealt with, but I believe that the current trade war is as much a personal beef with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping. Trump thought that he could play rough and that Xi would fold.
That was silly and shortsighted. The U.S. presidency is term-limited. China’s is not. The Chinese may experience pain from the trade war, but they can afford to wait Trump out.
The fact that Jerome Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve, won’t attempt to manipulate the economy in ways Trump thinks would be favorable, but is instead operating as an independent thinker, Trump takes as a personal slight. Trump appointed him. Trump demands loyalty and blind obeisance.
When China announced another round of retaliatory tariffs this week, Trump had a Twitter meltdown, tweeting “... My only question is, who is our bigger enemy, Jay Powell or Chairman Xi?” and sending the markets into a tailspin.
Trump hated North Korea’s Kim Jong Un before he loved him. Kim has played Trump like a fiddle. Kim has baited Trump into two summits, where Trump got nothing and Kim got a priceless public relations moment. Kim can just send Trump love letters and do what he wants and surrender nothing. In Trump’s paradigm of the personal, Kim likes him and is his friend.
Vladimir Putin is also exploiting Trump’s personal need to be liked — his weak man’s desire to be admired by strong men. Trump has a deep and mysterious affection for Putin. Yes, Putin helped to get him elected, but I’m not sure even that explains the way Trump genuflects for him.
Everyone around Trump knows his weakness: He is a bottomless pit of emotional need, someone who desperately wants friends but doesn’t have the emotional quotient to know how to make and keep them. So, they flatter him and inflate him.
They have all become major-league yes men and women.
None of this is good for the country. The presidency is not owned; it is occupied. It is bigger than any man or woman. Men have grown into it, but they have never subsumed it.
The presidency must have one eye on the past and one on the future. It must place national interest over personal interest. It has absolutely nothing to do with any one person’s feelings.
In George Washington’s farewell address of 1796, he said:
“The nation which indulges towards another a habitual hatred or a habitual fondness is in some degree a slave. It is a slave to its animosity or to its affection, either of which is sufficient to lead it astray from its duty and its interest.”
Trump is trying to embody the country and to lead it astray in the way that Washington warned against. Trump is a slave to his emotions, and this impulse is doing great harm to the nation, both internally and on the world stage.
I’m not sure that damage is irreparable. Our democracy, though fragile in many ways, has proved remarkably durable in others. But there is no doubt that the damage Trump is doing is deep and will take time and effort to undo.
Trump’s personal problems will leave a national scar.

Texto completo: It was bound to happen. Sooner or later someone was going to commit a crime in outer space.
Was it monster-ism? Treasonous behavior with aliens? Nonconsensual sex with another life form?
Nope. Turns out the first crime in space may just be a boring domestic dispute. I didn’t know it was possible to fight with your spouse or ex-spouse from 175 miles above Earth, but it is.
According to a report by The New York Times, astronaut Anne McClain improperly accessed the bank account of her estranged spouse, Summer Worden, while the former was aboard the International Space Station.
Depending on which version you’re willing to believe, McClain either merely looked at the status of the account (as she said she routinely did while on Earth) or she withdrew 20 bucks to buy a mocha latte from a passing asteroid.
McClain denies having done anything illegal, but Worden reported her to NASA, which is investigating with the help of the ESP (Extraterrestrial Space Police).
All of this seems like a bother over nothing, but at some point lawbreaking in microgravity was inescapable. We are, after all, talking about one of the most unpredictable life forms anywhere. That’s why my money had been on murder as the first offense.
Think about it. Is there any more stressful environment than living in a container the size of a recreational vehicle with a bunch of other people, while traveling 14,000 kph in an environment where the slightest miscalculation could turn you into instant space goo?
Unless it’s in the final moments of being eaten by an apex predator, probably not. That’s why mere handfuls of people are fit to become astronauts.
If you’re the sort of person with nerves easily plucked by coworkers who don’t refill the coffee pot, or have different political opinions, or simply forget to brush their teeth, how long would it take you to lose your lid?
The average time on Earth to reach such a boiling point is about eight days, or less than two minutes on social media. McClain, who has since returned to Earth, had been in space for six months during which the alleged crime occurred.
In addition to being accused of something over which no physical injury took place, McClain was outed as a lesbian astronaut because she was married to a woman.
Some people (all of them idiots) will find this unacceptable. Shouldn’t this matter, they “reason,” be turned over to the other ESP (Extrasexual Space Police)? What business does a gay person have in space?
Quick answer: None of yours.
Stop for a minute and consider the infinite number of gender variables there are in the universe. If you think it’s an easy answer, you need to watch more space monster movies. Not because they’re based on science we already understand but rather what might happen because of science we don’t yet even know about.
Instead of putting McClain through the social media grinder over what was essentially a private matter, we should sit back and wait to see if she brought back something to Earth with her.
I’m just saying — when a mob of slobbering aliens is cracking your skull open to eat your brain, are you really going to care about your bank account?

Forest Elephants Defend Against Climate Change, But They’re Almost Gone

Texto completo: Poaching destabilizes nations, disrupts ecosystems and threatens biodiversity. A recent study suggests still another consequence: Some types of poaching may also accelerate climate change.
Forest elephants - the smaller, endangered relatives of African savanna elephants - promote the growth of large trees that excel at storing carbon, according to research published in the journal Nature Geoscience.
Should forest elephants disappear, scientists estimated, Central Africa’s rainforest will lose about 3 billion tons of carbon - the equivalent of France’s total CO2 emissions for 27 years.
“This new paper points to something that we in Central Africa have suspected for a long time, but now this group has thrown some serious science at the issue,” said Fiona Maisels, a conservation scientist at the Wildlife Conservation Society and at the University of Stirling in Scotland.
“With the loss of forest elephants,” she added, “loss of carbon stocks can be added to the list of ecosystem services that are no longer provided by these animals.”
Over recent years, researchers have gained a more detailed understanding of the links between animals and climate. Wild grazers, for instance, can reduce the intensity and frequency of fires that emit greenhouse gases. Methane emissions from livestock significantly contribute to global warming.
Big difference
Scientists have also known for decades that large herbivores such as elephants play important short-term roles in ecosystems by promoting biodiversity, recycling nutrients and dispersing seeds.
Fabio Berzaghi, an ecologist at the Laboratory of Climate and Environmental Sciences in France and the lead author of the new study, suspected that elephants might also play a profound long-term role in shaping Africa’s rainforest, second in size only to the Amazon’s.
The Amazon lost its large herbivores 12,000 years ago, among them ground sloths that weighed over 3 tons, elephantlike creatures called gomphotheres and armadillolike glyptodonts that were the size of small cars.
The loss of these and other large herbivores likely contributed to the Amazon’s higher density of smaller trees, with a lower overall amount of vegetation compared with Africa’s rainforest.
“We were thinking elephants may play a role in the differences between these two continents’ forests,” Berzaghi said. “We also really wanted to know what the long-term consequences of losing this species would be.”
Berzaghi and his colleagues selected two field sites. One lies in the Democratic Republic of Congo, from which elephants disappeared 30 years ago because of poaching; the other is the Republic of Congo, where elephants lived at high numbers until recently.
Both sites were relatively pristine and differed only in the presence or absence of elephants. The researchers measured the trunk size of all the trees in the study areas and noted the species, giving them an idea of the short-term effects of elephant loss.
To determine the long-term effects, they created a computer model that simulated the basic functions of the African rainforest, including tree growth and death, competition, photosynthesis and reproduction. The model allowed them to include or exclude elephants.
Forest elephants almost exclusively stomp down trees with a diameter of 12 inches or less, and they prefer to eat fast-growing softwood trees. By clearing the understory of vegetation, the researchers found, elephants not only alter plant composition but also affect light penetration and water availability.
This results in an ecosystem that favors large, slow-growing hardwood trees. Such species store significantly more carbon than the equivalent volume of smaller softwood trees.
“As a tree, there’s a trade-off - you can’t have it all,” Berzaghi said. “You either invest in growing fast or in building a lot of structure with carbon to be more resistant.”
Valuable service
Extrapolating their findings to the whole of Africa’s rainforest, Berzaghi and his colleagues found that the disappearance of elephants would result in a 7% loss of vegetation - the equivalent of 3 billion tons of carbon storage.
Put another way, elephants provide a carbon storage service valued at $43 billion.
“This is the first study I have seen attributing large, multimegaton changes in carbon to a particular species,” said Rosie Fisher, a scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado, who was not involved in the research. “It really opens a new frontier in how we think about interactions between large animals and carbon storage.”
Save for a few surviving populations, forest elephants are functionally extinct in almost all of their former 850,000-square-mile habitat. The species declined by 62% from 2002 to 2011, Maisels and her colleagues found, and poaching has largely continued unchecked since then.
According to Iain Douglas-Hamilton, founder of Save the Elephants, a conservation organization based in Kenya, the killing has most recently spread to Gabon, which holds half of the world’s remaining forest elephants and was previously protected from poaching by its relative isolation.
“This study comes at a time when forest elephants are threatened as never before,” Douglas-Hamilton said. “It is appalling that just as we are beginning to understand how elephants might have a key role in Africa in sequestering carbon, they are under real threat of eradication.”
One limitation of the study, Berzaghi said, is that we do not know how much carbon has already been lost because of the elephants’ decline. But it does seem certain, he added, that putting a stop to poaching and restoring forest elephant populations would bring climate benefits.

Texto completo: It was the comment heard 'round the world - the dance world, at least.
TV personality Lara Spencer of ABC's "Good Morning America" poked fun last week at Prince George for taking ballet lessons. On Monday morning, she apologized on air.
"I screwed up," she said, staring straight into the camera. "The comment I made about dance was insensitive, it was stupid, and I am deeply sorry."
She followed that up with a pre-recorded segment with Robbie Fairchild, Travis Wall and Fabrice Calmels, three prominent professional male dancers, about their struggles with bullying growing up as boys in dance class.
Her comments prompted an eruption of criticism on social media throughout the weekend, including from those with ties to Pittsburgh's dance community.
Patricia Ward Kelly, the widow of Pittsburgh native and dance legend Gene Kelly, posted an open letter on Facebook, calling Spencer's behavior "unacceptable" and "incomprehensible." She highlighted the work that her late husband did to try to combat what she described as "the stigma facing male dancers," particularly the 1958 Omnibus TV special "Dancing, a Man's Game" for NBC.
"He hoped that by aligning the great sports stars of the day - Mickey Mantle, Johnny Unitas, Vic Seixas, Sugar Ray Robinson, among others - he could challenge and destroy the same shame surrounding male dancers once and for all," she wrote, adding that "Gene would be devastated to know that 61 years after his ground-breaking work the issue of boys and men dancing is still the subject of ridicule - and on a national network."
Erik Cavanaugh, a dancer and teacher who lives in Beechview, said that the comment did more than ridicule Prince George.
"You laughed at every little boy that is taking a dance class," he wrote in an Instagram post. He's garnered more than 125,000 followers on the social media platform with videos of him dancing in heels.
For others, though, the sting runs deeper than an off-the-cuff remark by a TV anchor. Some view what Spencer said as representative of lingering attitudes involving gender norms and inequities.
"We would like to address what we see as a concerning offshoot of the 'Good Morning America' bullying issue. There is a growing trend to somehow justify ballet by showing images of hyper masculine men like Arnold Schwarzenegger taking ballet," according to a post shared on the NuArts Productions Instagram account.
The foundation aims to provide opportunities for boys to study and explore dance in safe spaces. It's the brainchild of Scott Gormley of Long Island, N.Y., who produced and directed the 2018 film "Danseur" that chronicles the journeys and challenges of more than 20 male dancers of varying ages, backgrounds and experience levels. His son studied dance at Point Park University, where the film was screened for dance majors last September.
"We believe that dance is for EVERYONE - no matter their gender, body type, orientation, etc.," NuArts posted.
Pittsburgh-based dancer Taylor Knight agrees that her comments go "beyond boys and dance."
"It continues to question our deep-rooted judgments about what gender roles need to be," he told the Post-Gazette. Knight is part of the multidisciplinary dance duo slowdanger.
He shared a snapshot over the weekend of his experience with bullying on slowdanger's Instagram account via the Insta Stories feature.
"I started dancing at a young age, and I experienced bullying a lot," he recalled. "It is hard, but I used that to fuel and to push through and make something of myself. Dancers are some of the most resilient people I know."
He hopes comments like Spencer's don't discourage anyone from pursuing something they love.
"Dance has shaped and changed my life," he says, "and I'm hoping the work we do with slowdanger is doing that for other people, too."

Texto completo: Almost 40 wallabies have been found dead in recent days in northern Australia, sparking fears that they may have been poisoned, a conservation group says.
Since last Wednesday, at least 37 agile wallabies have been found dead in Cairns, Queensland, the New York Times and Australia's 7news reported.
"We've never seen anything like this before," Shai Ager, an ecologist with The Agile Project, told 7news. Ager's group works to protect wallabies, sometimes seen as pests in northern Australia.
Ager said the animals have been foaming at the mouth and died painful deaths. Video posted on Facebook from The Agile Project's account shows some of the dead wallabies with milky white eyes.

It's not clear what exactly is killing these animals, and Ager told local media she didn't want to rush to conclusions.
Toxicology reports and autopsies on the animals are due in the coming days, 7News reported. Ager told the New York Times, though, that there are signs that point to humans intervening in wallaby populations around the area.
Rescuers recently put up one-way fences around fields to keep the wallabies out and give them an exit should they make their way in. However, in the past week, some of the fences have been broken, and wallabies have been seen in the fields, the Times reported.

According to Australia's ABC News, killing a wallaby can lead to more than $30,000 in fines as they are protected under the state's Nature Conservation Act of 1992.
The Agile Project is working to relocate the wallaby population to protect them and keep them away from humans as the animals' habitats in the area have shrunk in recent years. According to the Guardian, the group has two possible locations identified and is due back in court in October.
"The government has been ignoring this population of wallabies hoping the situation goes away," Ager told the newspaper. "It's no surprise that people would be doing outrageous things like this. The public wants a relocation. The other option is a cull, but the majority of the community won't support that. "

Why oil price swings won't burn America's economy or your 401(k)

Texto completo: One week oil is spiking as Iran attacks tankers in the Strait of Hormuz – threatening to wreck the global economy. The next month, oil drops because tariffs allegedly whack Chinese demand and – you guessed it – wreck the global economy. Tune out these scare stories. They’re both bricks in this bull market’s wall of worry.
Tariffs I’ve addressed in this column before. Even with subsequent escalations, all threatened and newly enacted tariffs since 2017 total just 0. 3% of global GDP. Too tiny to render recession. Firms skirt many of these tariffs. America’s soaring Vietnamese and Taiwanese trade shows the sidestepping effect. Relax.
Consider Iran. Today’s fears seem stuck in the 1970s, when the Arab oil embargo contributed to worldwide shortages, stagflation and a ghastly recession. We presume Iran has the power to gyrate prices now by remembering that huge influence back then.
But times changed. Yes, the Strait of Hormuz is a critical oil chokepoint. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates one-fifth of global oil consumption passes through it daily. If it shuttered, prices, which are set globally, would soar. But Iran probably can’t shut the Strait alone. While its seizure of a British tanker stole headlines, that is one ship among many traversing the Strait daily. The U. S. and British navies effectively ensure safe passage for the vast majority.
Then too, this isn’t Iran’s first time threatening traffic. The 1980s “Tanker War” between Iran and Iraq hit scores of oil transports. But prices didn’t jump. Not only was it a fraction of total traffic, but oil production grew outside the Middle East, offsetting the tiny impact.
Economy: A decade after the big one, what kind of recession will we have next?
That’s the history we’re repeating now – not the 1970s. In the 1980s, the supply offset came from Europe – the North Sea. Now, it comes from U. S. shale fields like Texas, New Mexico and North Dakota. According to BP’s annual oil report, U. S. production soared by 2. 2 million barrels per day in 2018 – the largest, single-country rise ever. The EIA sees domestic output jumping another 1. 36 million barrels this year. Unlike producers elsewhere, U. S. rigs can pump profitably at lower prices, thanks to massive efficiency gains.
And if I’m wrong? If prices soar? Again, this isn’t the 1970s. The days when high oil prices could wreck our economy are as gone as disco and bell-bottoms. Our economy is far less energy-intensive now, thanks to the service sector’s ascendance. In 1970, heavy industry was 32. 1% of annual output, versus 65. 5% for services and 2. 4% for agriculture. Now? Heavy industry is just 18. 5%, while services are a mighty 80. 7%. Services simply use less energy than factories. But even manufacturing has cut energy use in recent decades through enhanced efficiency.
Yes, America consumes lots of oil, and it gets lots more GDP for each barrel of oil consumed. In 1990, we got $13. 7 million in inflation-adjusted GDP from every thousand tons of oil consumed. Now, it’s $23. 8 million.
Services’ rise debunks one other lingering oil fear: that last year’s weaker demand outside China, India and America reflects a weakening world. In reality, it simply reflects weaker manufacturing – widely discussed and priced in. Meanwhile, services kept the global economy growing reasonably. They still does now. All this reminds me of 2015 and 2016, when oil plunged to $26 per barrel. Yet GDP in the U. S. grew all the while, rising 2. 9% in 2015 and 1. 6% in 2016. Only oil-reliant nations hit the skids.
So don’t sweat oil’s swings. They’re false fears that are priced into stocks now. Fear of false factors or tiny negatives is always bullish. The bull market continues.

Texto completo: While reading letters submitted to the opinion page, it suddenly dawned on me that writers opposed to the Trump Administration usually give logical, well-written arguments. They use keen observation and rational conclusions.
Trump supporters are usually claiming a complicit media, a conspiracy of liberal elements, an angry hateful mob, or an invasion of brown immigrants are undermining the president. They defend unscientific ideas. They will defend the president regardless of the reality staring them in the face.
Do you know how insane this is?
Rick Rouse, Mesa
Slavery has been glossed over and misrepresented in textbooks I'm glad to see The Republic and USA Today embrace the New York Times "1619 Project," which seeks to re-educate Americans to the pervasiveness of slavery in our country.
Since before the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock to this day, slavery has been endemic to America as a nation and as a people, not merely an embarrassing chapter or a single, uncomfortable episode.
Sadly glossed over and misrepresented in history and textbooks and often unwittingly misunderstood by our teachers, the lasting impact of slavery must be better known and understood by all if we ever hope to stop racism and hate in America.
Robert Griffin, Scottsdale
History bent to serve a political agenda is a stranger to the truth The lengthy article on ancestors is a blatant example of manufactured history. The USA is not the evil empire that enslaved Africans. Slavery has existed for thousands of years.
The exploitation of the African slave trade was facilitated by rival tribal forces capturing their enemy and selling them as slaves to outside slave traders. This is Africans selling Africans.
The Arab empires of the Middle East were probably the biggest slave traders drawing on Africa. There was no dignity for the slaves in that market either.
The slave trade flourished in all of the Western Hemisphere, not just the English colonies, which is what America was from 1609 until 1776.
The USA was 30 years after England in 1863. The last global country to abolish slavery was in 1981. Saudi Arabia abolished slavery in 1962. It is a great disservice to truth when history is distorted for an agenda.

Texto completo: Here are my five favorite things about this sentence: (1) It grabs your attention, (2) It keeps you guessing, (3) It's not overly wordy, (4) It's something you might forward to friends, (5) It's part of the list-making trend that just keeps growing.
The New York Times sent subscribers an email on Aug. 11 promoting "12 new books our editors liked" and "10 best new recipes." There was also a report on "the 50 best TV shows on Netflix right now." 50! That's quite a list. I expect a follow-up in which editors select "the 10 best TV shows on our list of Netflix's 50 best TV shows."
The very same day:
The Boston Globe continued its obsession with sports lists: "Eight takeaways from the Patriots' time in Michigan."
The Washington Post offered, "Eight non-culinary tools you can use in the kitchen." (Spoiler: one is a blow torch.)
The Chicago Tribune: "10 summer care tips for curly hair." Parade magazine: "20 songs Joni Mitchell Wrote About Men."
So, yes, it seems we're all drawn to lists. And, clearly, editors have figured that out.
The Internet's clickosphere contributes to it. Just Google "Top 10 Lists" and you'll be amazed. A few of my favorites: "Top 10 Researchers Who Experimented on Themselves" and "10 People Who Gained Genius from Brain Damage."
I blame David Letterman for this. His Top 10 lists were delicious late-night snacks, with entries such as: "Top 10 Things That Sound Cool When Said by Snoop Dogg."
Of course, Dave is now off in semi-retirement, trying desperately to come up with a list of 10 good reasons not to shave his beard, and undoubtedly laughing over the fact that editors can't resist his fun-with-lists gimmick.
There's an actual Wikipedia section titled "List of lists of lists." How detailed is it? It includes "List of Tamil films of the 1940s" and "Lists of 'Dungeons & Dragons' monsters."
Buzzfeed has popularized the term "listicle," which is any article in the form of a list — and Buzzfeed's listicles get millions of views!
So, my Top Five reasons for writing this: (5) I will presumably be paid, (4) It required little thinking, (3) It's summer, after all, (2) Readers love lists, and (1) It serves to remind us that lists, while sometimes engaging, should never be confused with actual writing.

Texto completo: Earlier this summer, I read a news story about Paradise, Calif., the town that was completely wiped out by the Camp Fire. It was about the homes that survived because they had been fireproofed.
Fireproofed homes came through intact with little to no damage. The problem, however, was that the homeowners couldn't just move home - they couldn't go back to an abandoned neighborhood with no electricity, no services, everything around them destroyed or closed (even the fire department burned down), no place for their kids to go school, no neighbors.
Some insurance companies are now going to cancel fire insurance coverage on homes in certain towns in California and a handful of other Western states. In those cases, current policies will just expire, and the insurance companies will not renew fire coverage on homes in towns very likely to be affected by wild fires.
"By not being able to find insurance, you then in turn can't sell your home. If you can't sell your home, then it affects the local property taxes. This is really creating chaos," California's insurance commissioner was recently quoted in The New York Times.
Does this sound familiar? In Connecticut, if you live in a home with a crumbling foundation, your current insurance company can't cancel your homeowners insurance policy thanks to legislative advocacy preventing insurers from being able to cancel when a crumbling foundation is discovered. But you can't sell a house with a crumbling foundation, and even if you did, the new owner would not be able to obtain a new policy. Not on a home with a known crumbling foundation. This prevents home sales and affects property taxes.
I fully support fixing every home that has a known crumbling foundation. But in the meantime, life has to go on. Not every home can affordably be fixed. I recently met with a couple who would have to spend an extra $75,000 or more on top of any state money they receive to complete the foundation replacement. Their home is older, they have their original kitchen, bathroom, window and so on. The house will still need a lot of renovating and updating, and even if that work was done, they still could not sell for much more than they currently owe on their mortgage, never mind any additional loans they would need to take out to complete the foundation repair and the updates.
They are hardly unique. Situations like this are currently throwing individual households into chaos. Homeowners who are on the cusp of selling discover they have a crumbling foundation, and it throws off their plans to retire, to downsize, to recoup the equity they thought they had in their homes. The inability to sell a home with a crumbling foundation (or one that is in a neighborhood or town where the issue is widespread) is affecting everyone's home values. When home values go down, so does the collection of enough tax revenue to support those town services (like fire departments and schools). With less money to work with, towns will have to start cutting services, which will make those towns less attractive to new potential home buyers, again driving down home values and ability to collect property taxes.
As homeowners decide that living through a foundation replacement and all the extra costs associated with that is just not reasonable for their household, we could see streets, neighborhoods, then towns, then counties - and finally, clearly, our entire state and region - thrown into chaos.
The state must do more, and we residents must not fight the efforts to help these homeowners. We need to stop being critical of the homeowners who need the assistance as if helping them is taking money out of our pockets. Imagine if all the homes on the shoreline damaged by storms were never repaired - think about what that would do to those streets, neighborhoods and towns. If the crumbling foundation problem is not corrected quickly, we will all suffer to a degree much larger than we perceive to be the current cost of repair.

Texto completo: A Spokane native and decorated NASA astronaut is under scrutiny for accessing the bank account of her estranged spouse while aboard the International Space Station, according to the New York Times.
Summer Worden, a former Air Force intelligence officer and National Security Agency employee, filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission accusing Anne McClain of identity theft for improperly viewing the account. She has not alleged that McClain moved or used the funds in the bank account, the Times reported. Soon after Worden filed her complaint, Worden's family reportedly filed a second complaint with NASA's Office of Inspector General.
In sworn testimony to the inspector general, the Times reports that McClain did not deny that she accessed the account but told investigators she was acting with Worden's permission and was using a password she had previously used and was never told to stop using. She said she viewed the account to ensure her family's financial well-being in her absence.
Rusty Hardin, McClain's lawyer, reportedly said his client "strenuously denies that she did anything improper" and "is totally cooperating" with investigators.
The Spokesman-Review's efforts to reach Hardin late Friday were unsuccessful.
Worden's allegations come amid a lengthy separation and parenting dispute between the pair.
McClain went to court in 2018 seeking shared parenting rights and the sole right to designate the residence of Worden's son, who was born about a year before the two met, the Times reported.
Later the same year, McClain reportedly accused Worden of assault. Those charges were dismissed.

DON'T OVERLOOK KASHMIR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF INDIA'S DECISIONS APPEARS TO BE GENTRIFICATION.

Texto completo: India recently took the unprecedented step to strip the Muslim majority state of Kashmir of its special status as guaranteed in the Indian Constitution.
The root of the dispute between India and Pakistan goes back to 1947 when the Indian subcontinent was partitioned into a predominantly Muslim Pakistan and a majority Hindu India. Pakistan claims Kashmir because it is a majority Muslim area and is geographically contiguous with Pakistan. India claims Kashmir because the ruler of Kashmir opted to join India after the partition. In the past, there have been many attempts at mediation by the United Nations and countless talks between the two countries. Nothing has broken the deadlock, including two costly and bloody wars fought in 1948 and 1965. The Kashmir dispute took on an added urgency when India and Pakistan went nuclear.
Kashmir is a police state where India has positioned half a million soldiers to control a population of 8 million Kashmiris. The soldiers have blanket immunity from prosecution for flagrant human rights abuses. And there have been plenty of human rights violations, as documented by international Human Rights Watch and the U.N. High Commission for Human Rights.
In the past 30 years, in excess of 94,000 Kashmiris have died at the hands of Indian soldiers. There have been more than 10,000 people disappeared and a similar number of women raped.
India blames Pakistan, with some justification, for the unrest that has gripped the region off and on for the better part of 70 years. But it would be foolhardy to believe that another country can sustain an insurgency without the support of the local population. And that population has categorically rejected India's claim over their homeland. And they also reject the idea of joining Pakistan. They want independence.
On the pretext of an impending terrorist attack by Pakistan, the government of current Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi pulled out all foreigners and non-Kashmiri Indian citizens from Kashmir, including reporters. It imposed a complete curfew over the valley and cut off all means of communication. Then it announced it was revoking the article of the constitution that gave Kashmir its special status.
Earlier this month, the curfew was relaxed for a few hours in order for people to attend Friday religious services. After services, 10,000 people gathered to demonstrate against the total shutdown and house-imprisonment of 8 million people. The police, as had been done previously, used tear gas and pellet guns to disperse the crowd. Many people were injured and taken to hospitals, particularly with pellet injuries to the eyes. (The New York Times, reporting on previous incidents, has written that the practice of using pellet guns has resulted in an epidemic of blindness in the valley.)
Most experts agree that the sole purpose of this change in the status of Kashmir is gentrification. It would allow Hindu nationalists to buy land in Kashmir and change the demographics. If it is to curb militancy and terrorism, then Mr. Modi has to dispense of the entire Muslim population of Kashmir.
According to a former chief minister of Kashmir, Mahbooba Mufti, by removing the special status of Kashmir, India has declared itself as a foreign country occupying an independent people. She compared the current occupation by Indian forces to the Israeli occupation of Palestinian land in the West Bank and Gaza.
Perhaps it is not coincidental that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is poised to visit India in the very near future.

SCHOOL'S OPEN. ARM YOURSELF. EDUCATION MUST GET STUDENTS TO OPERATE IN AREAS WITH POTENTIALLY WORLD-CHANGING IDEAS

Texto completo: From what I've read, it's pretty clear that Nelson Mandela chose his words carefully. So when the late South African revolutionary and Nobel Laureate elected to equate education with weaponry, you had to figure he was onto something.
"Education," he said, "is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world."
America went back to school this month with its need to weaponize education more urgent than ever. In a country that always seems to know more and more about nothing but less and less about something, educators at all levels have to feel like they're guiding students through an ever-intensifying blizzard of disparate information, much of it accumulating in the palms of their hands.
The effect is, to strain the metaphor, chilling.
This week, I talked with three educators of varied backgrounds and academic platforms, three for whom I have the utmost respect, and each independently identified the same daunting challenge: There is more to know than ever, and the delineation between what Mandela would weaponize to change the world and everything else has virtually disappeared.
"I'm getting from college freshman that they've kind of been numbed to learning," one told me. "There's just so much out there and it all runs together. They don't memorize anything because they can just look it up on their phone, where knowing which Kardashian is which is just as important as knowing what the capital of France is or who the prime minister of England is. They don't know how to distinguish what's important, but at some point, when you're talking to someone, you're going to have to show that you actually know something."
Blisteringly true, but not if you want to go into government, necessarily.
American government, maybe you've noticed, is thick with functionaries who have no idea how American government works, particularly at the highest levels.
There's a popular trope which posits that this is in some part because we don't teach civics anymore, but that's partly a dodge and generally not true. We might not call it civics, but government studies are often folded into social studies curricula, though it's correct to say the degree to which social studies are required varies wildly from district to district and coast to coast.
Government is still being taught, which you know because Trumbull High in Connecticut last April won its eighth consecutive state championship and 24th since 1987 in a competition developed by the Center For Civic Education. In these events, students testify as constitutional experts before panels of judges acting as congressional committees, where they're grilled on depth of knowledge, understanding and their ability to apply constitutional principles.
So, you missed that on ESPN2?
Outside of Trumbull High and its worthy competitors, knowledge of governmental structures and processes tends to diminish just a bit, depressingly so if you include the great majority of Americans who, as went the ancient Sam Cooke diddy, don't know much about history.
A survey done by the Woodrow Wilson Fellowship Foundation found that 64% of Americans could not pass the immigration exam given to non-citizens, about 91% of whom pass both it and the English exam, according to a July story in The New York Times.
The same Wilson Foundation noted that 87% of us don't know the year the Constitution was signed, 60% don't know which countries America fought in World War II, and 57% don't know how many justices are on the Supreme Court. So this is a country where more people are sure that Michael Jackson wrote "Beat it," than are aware that the Bill of Rights is part of the Constitution.
"The fact that people are ignorant about history and political structure is not about what's being taught in school," said another of my education consultants. "The people who do know these things are the people who read the news. I'm very suspicious about any nostalgic notion that 'Oh kids today aren't getting what we got.'
"It's been demonstrated that Americans don't know basic government and history, but my general crankiness about it is that it has more to do with the fact that there's so much more junk to consume. People can tell you who won 'The Bachelor' for the past seven years because that (knowledge) is something they're using."
Thus your "Bachelor" bonafides might fall into what's called operational learning (rather than memorization). I can tell you off the top of my head who won every World Series back to about 1950 because that's where I've sort of been operating for most of my life, not because I memorized a list of champions.
Getting students to operate in areas with potentially world-changing ideas, to use Mandela's weaponry, is an educational challenge in which difficulty and urgency are hurtling along parallel tracks.
Or, as the Wilson Foundation President Arthur Levine put it, "Americans need to understand the past in order to make sense of a chaotic present and an inchoate future. History is both an anchor in a time when change assails us and a laboratory for studying the changes that are occurring. It offers the promise of providing a common bond among Americans in an era in which our divisions are profound and our differences threaten to overshadow our commonalities."
God bless you educators. All that is riding on this is everything.

Use of Food Delivery Apps Grows. So Does Toll Among Couriers.

Texto completo: CAPE TOWN -- He had delivered his last food order for the evening and was driving home from Pinelands, a suburb in Cape Town, when an oncoming car swung in front of him, knocking him off his motorbike.
Friends and family arrived within 20 minutes, but the motorcyclist, Christian Hakomeyimana, was already dead. A 20-year-old Rwandan migrant, he had been a contractor for Mr. D Food, an online food delivery service popular in South Africa.
"That car hit him so hard," said Xavier Nshimiyamana, one of his closest friends. The bike, he said, was smashed to pieces -- "completely beyond repair."
Mr. Hakomeyimana's death in the July 5 crash was just one in a rising number of casualties among food delivery workers in South Africa. The emergence here of food delivery apps like Mr. D Food and Uber Eats has drawn thousands of motorbike riders -- predominantly migrants -- into poorly regulated and highly precarious work.
Migrants around the world have long signed up for dangerous jobs, but experts warn that the gig economy makes it even harder for the authorities to monitor working conditions and enforce labor laws.
"Food delivery is an inherently dangerous line of work in South Africa," said Mark Graham, a geography professor at Oxford University who studies the gig economy in developing nations. "Workers put themselves at risk every time they take on a job."
According to the Motorcycle Safety Institute, a local organization that collects accident statistics, at least 70 delivery riders -- most of them food couriers -- have died in South Africa over the past year. Hundreds more have been injured.
"As demand for food and small item delivery increases, so does risk to the rider," said Hein Jonker, the institute's director.
"The figures," he said, "are frightening."
South Africa's food couriers often drive unsafe motorbikes with broken lights, missing mirrors or parts held together with string and tape. Most lack formal motorbike training and adequate protective gear. Only a few have insurance coverage or death benefits.
"Business owners have no responsibility to contracted riders," Mr. Jonker said. "This is a serious matter of exploitation."
Mr. D Food, which along with Uber Eats controls nearly 90 percent of South Africa's booming food delivery market, declined to answer questions. The company is owned by Naspers, a global media and technology giant, and recently announced that its order revenues had grown by 170 percent within a year.
A spokeswoman for Uber South Africa, Samantha Fuller, said in response to questions from The New York Times that her company would begin physically inspecting the bikes used by its couriers. This was not done in the past, she said.
Last year, Uber Eats introduced free insurance coverage in South Africa, including for emergency medical care and payouts for death and disability. But the payouts are capped at about $ 13,000 -- and riders qualify for them only when they are on active trips, not if they are returning from a delivery.
Mr. D Food does not offer its couriers compensation for accidents.
Food delivery app workers in other countries are also grappling with poor labor protections. In France, food couriers outsource work to undocumented migrants, siphoning a portion of their earnings. In Mexico, at least five Uber Eats drivers have died on the job in traffic accidents since November.
But in South Africa, the dangers of being a food courier are particularly acute. The country is infamous for its high rates of traffic mortality, with more than twice as many fatalities per 100,000 people in 2016 than in the United States, according to the World Health Organization.
Adding to the danger, many couriers here use fraudulent licenses and fake vehicle registration documents with impunity.
The Uber spokeswoman, Ms. Fuller, said her company put couriers through "a stringent onboarding process." It requires them to submit valid licenses, vehicle registration documents and work permits before they join the app, she said.
But Ms. Fuller said it was the responsibility of the transportation authorities to detect fraudulent documents.
A spokeswoman for the Cape Town traffic department, Maxine Bezuidenhout, said that her agency did routine checks and that it suspended unroadworthy vehicles, including motorbikes, from operating on public roads. Drivers found with fake licenses and registration documents are charged with fraud, she added.
But the industry, too, should help fix the problem, Ms. Bezuidenhout said.
"One would hope that the companies have a vested interest in the safety of their drivers, but also the public at large, and would therefore put checks and balances in place," she said.
The driver accused of knocking Mr. Hakomeyimana off his bike was arrested and charged with culpable homicide and drunken driving, said a police spokesman, Andre Traut. The Motorcycle Safety Institute does not have data on how other food courier deaths have been handled by the police.
For young men like Mr. Hakomeyimana, food delivery is an appealing prospect in a country where they have very limited access to the job market. South Africa is inundated with requests for asylum or refugee status, and the wait for work permits can last years.
The pay may be low -- couriers seldom pocket more than $ 330 in a month -- but it is simple to sign up online for work, even with forged documents, delivery workers say. More than a dozen agreed to be interviewed, but declined to use their names because they feared their contracts would be revoked.
The only reason so many undocumented migrants do this work is that it can be done without papers, said one undocumented Uber Eats courier from Zambia. But that leaves them vulnerable to exploitation by the delivery companies, he said.
Mr. Hakomeyimana moved to Cape Town in 2017, moving in with an older brother named Pacifique. He began working for Mr. D Food but quit because the pay was too low, becoming a driver with Uber instead, his brother said.
In South Africa, few Uber drivers can afford their own vehicles, instead renting them from partners. In July, the car Mr. Hakomeyimana was using was involved in an accident, and while waiting for it to be repaired, he returned to food delivery.
"I can't sit around -- I need to earn something," his brother recalled him saying.
Two days later, Mr. Hakomeyimana was dead.
He was an experienced rider and owned a bike in good condition, according to his brother, who works as a mechanic. "But even for him, it wasn't safe," he said.
At the house the brothers shared in Athlone, a working-class neighborhood near the city, friends and relatives gathered to pray a few days after the accident. A framed portrait of Mr. Hakomeyimana, fresh-faced and neatly dressed, hung in the lounge.
Back in Rwanda he had been a truck driver, hauling cargo across East Africa. If he had died on the job, the company would have been obliged to cover his funeral and pay a lump sum, the mourners said.
In South Africa, his family got nothing.
"They just give you a job, they don't look after you afterwards," said Mr. Nshimiyamana, the courier's friend.
In the same week Mr. Hakomeyimana died, a delivery bike caught fire in central Cape Town; the flames had to be extinguished by city firefighters. At least three more riders crashed within a two-mile radius. Heavy winter rains made driving especially hazardous, but the orders continued pouring in.
A courier from Tanzania witnessed all but one of these accidents. An undocumented migrant, he was involved in an accident of his own in March, badly injuring his knee.
The courier said he crossed the border illegally in 2016, hiding in the back of a truck. In South Africa he purchased false papers and began working for Uber Eats, sending money back home to his mother and younger siblings.
He came upon the scene of Mr. Hakomeyimana's crash while returning from a delivery, he said. He recognized the body amid the wreckage beside the road.
Since then, he said, he has cut back on his working hours. He needs the money, but is afraid he may be next.

Texto completo: As we pulled into the parking lot at the Fort Monroe National Monument in Virginia, my mind was racing. I have yet to master the art of feeling graceful while producing in the field, and it certainly didn't help that it was 88 degrees.
But I had one primary task: to capture Nikole Hannah-Jones's journey to Point Comfort through sound for the "1619" podcast. Her reactions on tape were just as important as the soft bubbling of the waves on a stack of rocks, or the drone of the cicadas that seemed to go quiet every time I tried to record them.
We made our way past the docks to the beach, where little kids in brightly colored swimsuits splashed in the clear, teal water. In that moment, I found myself recalling an earlier trip I took to Elmina Castle and its "Door of No Return" in Ghana. Millions of captured Africans had been held at places like Elmina before they were forced onto ships that would transport them across the Atlantic Ocean.
When I visited Elmina, the walls of the castle radiated a depth of emotion that I have never experienced walking into any other building. It felt as if terror was always in the room.
It's hard to imagine the loss that men and women experienced inside those walls, before the ships even set sail. And looking out at the water from the castle, I thought about how those men and women would never return home.
Now, on the beach in Virginia, I was at the opposite end of that passage across the ocean. Watching the waves there, everything slowed.
I thought of the 20 or so Africans who stepped onshore 400 years ago. I thought of Phillis Wheatley and Cudjoe Lewis and the other captured Africans who survived the trans-Atlantic slave trade, and who built so much of this country.
I wondered what they did with those memories of home, the ones that reverberated in their heads and their hearts.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.
Photograph Recording the sound of waves at Port Comfort, Va., for an episode of The Daily. (PHOTOGRAPH BY ADIZAH EGHAN/THE NEW YORK TIMES) CHART: THIS WEEK ON THE DAILY: Here is a lightly edited excerpt from the Aug. 23 episode of The Daily: "Introducing '1619,' a New York Times Audio Series," featuring Nikole Hannah-Jones, who hosts the new series, and producer Adizah Eghan in Virginia. Nikole Hannah-Jones It's quiet out here, there's seagulls. The sun is warm but it's not too humid. It's actually kind of a great day for fishing. That's why it stinks. Adizah Eghan What does it smell like? Hannah-Jones It smells like dead fish. Smells like the water. Eghan What is going through your head right now? Hannah-Jones I don't know. I was thinking about what they went through. I don't know. I just wonder a lot what it was like. Eghan What happened here? Hannah-Jones I mean, we really don't know a lot. A pirate ship by the name of White Lion sailed into the bay here, and they needed to trade something of value so that they could get supplies to make the rest of their journey. And what they traded were 20 to 30 Africans. And this would be at this place, kind of ironically called Point Comfort, where slavery in the British North American colonies that would go on to become the United States begins.

Texto completo: What's on TV
HITSVILLE: THE MAKING OF MOTOWN 9 p.m. on Showtime. There seems to be something for every stripe of music fan on this network, which ventured into Rick Rubin's creative haven on "Shangri-La" and charted the rise of the Wu-Tang Clan with "Of Mics and Men." This documentary goes further back in history to explore a time of social unrest, when the music of Motown Records became influential in America in the 1960s. The focus is on the birth of the company in Detroit in 1958, as well as the many hits the label produced up through its move to Los Angeles in the 1970s, told through interviews with the company's founder, Berry Gordy. The film features rare behind-the-scenes and performance footage and interviews with artists like Smokey Robinson, John Legend and Jamie Foxx.
ALL SUMMER LONG 9 p.m. on Hallmark. Working on a boat for the entire summer alongside your ex could be, for some, a nightmare scenario. That's the premise of this film starring Autumn Reeser and Brennan Elliott as the former companions who must learn to get along as the new captain and chef of a vintage yacht. As the summer progresses, the two grow closer and begin to re-evaluate their feelings, because what's more romantic than sailing on a yacht?
V.C. ANDREWS' WEB OF DREAMS 8 p.m. on Lifetime. Whether you've gotten all the way through your summer reading list, or haven't found the time to start, you can still get a taste of V.C. Andrews's stories, which have been adapted for the screen on Lifetime. These made-for-TV movies chronicle the writer's Casteel series, which focuses on the secrets, lust and betrayals of a troubled West Virginia family. The final installment, "Web of Dreams," revisits the family's origins and tells the story of a young woman named Leigh (played by Jennifer Laporte), who is abused by her stepfather. The story sets the stage for the cycle of abuse that Leigh's daughter, Heaven, and her granddaughter, Annie, endure at the hands of men in the other books and Lifetime installments.
What's Streaming
MAPPLETHORPE (2018) Stream on Hulu. After his stint as the 11th Doctor on "Doctor Who," the English actor Matt Smith has taken on historical roles that have stretched from British royalty (Prince Philip in "The Crown") to American depravity (Charles Manson in "Charlie Says"). In this fictionalized biopic, Smith taps into the life of Robert Mapplethorpe, the American photographer who died of AIDS in 1989, at age 42. The film, directed by Ondi Timoner, covers his friendship with Patti Smith, his sexual exploration, his relationship with Sam Wagstaff and, of course, his bold photography. The film covers a lot of ground, but in his New York Times review, Glenn Kenny wrote that it's "most alive when it's putting its subject's pictures on the screen, which it does often." He added that the film should have done so more, "because the movie is otherwise as timid as its subject was bold."

Amid claims of anti-Semitism, Trump invokes a problematic Ford

Texto completo: President Donald Trump, who recently embraced the title of "King of Israel, has been repeatedly accused of promoting anti-Semitic tropes this week for his assertions that Jewish Americans who vote for Democrats are "disloyal.
On Wednesday night, just hours after Trump dismissed the criticisms and shared quotes from a conspiracy theorist claiming that Israeli Jews "love him like he is the second coming of God, the president appeared to depart from the ongoing debate by firing off several tweets about the auto industry. But critics quickly noted that two of those missives positively referenced "legendary American automaker Henry Ford, who was once regarded by Adolf Hitler as his "inspiration and is arguably the most notorious anti-Semite in modern U.S. history.
"Today is really not the best day for Trump to be taking the side of Henry Ford, Dan McLaughlin, a contributing columnist at National Review Online, tweeted.
The White House did not respond to questions early Thursday about whether Trump was aware of Ford's bigoted views, which have been described as "the most controversial and least admirable aspect of a career that included founding the Ford Motor Company, pioneering assembly-line production and creating the Model T.
"He really has a very dark history as far as the Jewish community and Jews are concerned, said one Jewish leader in Florida about Ford in a 2014 Religion News Service article.
Ordinarily, name-dropping Ford when discussing cars might not draw attention, but Trump did it as he weathered backlash from Jewish leaders and organizations over his earlier comments calling Jewish people "disloyal because of their politics. Critics argued that Trump had echoed a historic anti-Semitic stereotype that Jews have "dual loyalty, The Washington Post's Felicia Sonmez reported.
"American Jews - like all Americans - have a range of political views and policy priorities, David Harris, chief executive of the nonpartisan American Jewish Committee, said in a statement. "His assessment of their knowledge or loyalty,' based on their party preference, is inappropriate, unwelcome, and downright dangerous.
In that context, some critics drew a direct line from Wednesday's tweets to Ford's dark ties to anti-Semitism.
Between 1910 and 1918, Ford became "increasingly anti-immigrant, anti-labor, anti-liquor and anti-Semitic, according to the Jewish Virtual Library. He believed "the bankers and "the Jews were responsible for not only wars but also the rise of other things he disapproved of such as short skirts and jazz music, the Henry Ford Museum wrote.
Ford's antipathy toward Jews became public knowledge soon after he purchased a newspaper published in Dearborn, Michigan, where his company was headquartered. In May 1920, the Dearborn Independent, which "primarily served as a forum for Henry Ford's views, launched an anti-Jewish series titled "The International Jew: The World's Problem that continued for several years, according to the museum. The articles were later compiled into a book and sought to bring attention to a conspiracy theory that Jews were plotting to take over the world.
At one point, the newspaper also printed "Protocols of the Elders of Zion, a book already widely discredited as fake by that time and later dubbed "the worst piece of anti-Semitic propaganda generated in the 20th century.
It wasn't long before Ford and the Independent started to receive worldwide recognition, even catching the attention of Hitler. By the mid-1920s, the newspaper had reached a circulation of 900,000. Ford is the only American mentioned by name in "Mein Kampf, Hitler's autobiographical manifesto, according to Religion News Service. In his writings, Hitler called Ford a "great man.
"You can tell Herr Ford that I am a great admirer of his, Hitler once reportedly said. "I shall do my best to put his theories into practice in Germany.
A portrait of Ford hung in Hitler's Munich office, the New York Times reported in 1922. A table in the antechamber was also covered with translated copies of a book written and published by Ford. When a Detroit News reporter asked Hitler about the painting, he responded, "I regard Henry Ford as my inspiration, the Dearborn Historian reported.
Ford later apologized and blamed some of the anti-Semitic propaganda on his employees. He shuttered the Independent, but continued to support the Nazi Party and advocated that America to stay out of what would become World War II, The Washington Post's Michael Dobbs reported. In July 1938, Ford received the Grand Cross of the German Eagle, the highest honor Nazi Germany could bestow on a foreigner.

Evoking 1968, Joe Biden asks New Hampshire voters: What if Barack Obama had been assassinated in 2008?

Resumen: Reflecting on a turbulent period in the late 1960s that included high-profile assassinations of prominent U.S. political figures, former VP Joe Biden asked voters in New Hampshire to imagine what would have happened if Barack Obama had been assassinated in 2008.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Joe Biden, the former vice president and current front-runner in the sprawling Democratic primary field of more than 20 candidates, asked a curious question of New Hampshire voters at Dartmouth College on Friday: What if Barack Obama had been assassinated?
During a discussion of mental health and school shootings at a health care town hall in Hanover, the former VP turned to his collegiate days, and spoke of the assassinations of his “political heroes,” Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy, who were assassinated within weeks of each other.
Biden said, "My senior semester, they were both shot and killed. Imagine what would have happened if, God forbid, if Barack Obama had been assassinated after becoming the de facto nominee. What would've happened in America?"
The comments were reported on by multiple media outlets, including the New York Times, NBC, the Associated Press and the Washington Post.
The startling question came a day after Biden posted on Twitter posted about when Obama asked him to become his running mate in 2008. The 76-year-old served as Obama’s vice president for the entirety of Obama's time in the Oval Office from 2009-2017.
Only three days earlier at an event in Iowa, Biden initially misspoke, saying that Kennedy and King had been shot “in the late 1970’s” instead of 1968.
Of Biden's New Hampshire comments Friday, the New York Times reports he was trying to make a point about becoming politically aware and motivated in the turbulent times of the 1960s and 1970s, discussing the deadly Kent State shootings during a Vietnam War protest in 1970. He successfully ran for Senate in 1972 when he was 29 years old.
Biden also said Friday he was accused of being gay decades ago because he supported women's rights, referring to the Equal Rights Amendment.
"An entire generation was energized. We finally finished the Voting Rights Act. We finally got the Civil Rights Act back on the road. We finally were in a position where we started to begin the women’s movement, and began to treat women — I remember because I was such a big supporter of the E. R. A. in 1972, quote — to show you how things have changed, thank God — 'Well, you know why Biden is for the E. R. A. , he’s probably gay. ' Not a joke," Biden recalled.
During a campaign event in Nashua, N. H. , on Monday, Dr. Jill Biden, Biden's wife and the former second lady, said that Democrats should vote in the upcoming primaries and caucuses for who will ultimately beat President Donald Trump even if they don't agree fully with all of Joe Biden's policy stances.
“I know that not all of you are committed to my husband, and I respect that,” she said. “But I want you to think about your candidate, his or her electability, and who’s going to win this race. ”
Biden is seeking the Democratic nomination for president for a third time after two failed runs in 1988 and 2008.

Texto completo: In the world of robots, high-tech gadgets, and Internet startups, Joi Ito is a star. As the head of the freewheeling MIT Media Lab, he oversees an eclectic band of computer scientists, artists, engineers, and architects who tinker on the far edges of innovation in a place commonly known as the “future factory."
Ito has spoken at the Davos World Economic Forum and hosted Silicon Valley royalty and Hollywood celebrities such as filmmaker J.J. Abrams, who was granted a fellowship at the lab. He is in such demand as an authority on the future of technology that he regularly pulls in fees of $100,000 to speak to corporate groups around the world.
But in recent days, the globe-trotting Ito has found himself in the midst of a crisis that is tearing at the lab he has helped to elevate since taking it over in 2011 at age 44.
This month, Ito acknowledged that he had extensive personal and professional ties to Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced financier who committed suicide in prison Aug. 10 while facing federal charges of sex trafficking of underage girls.
Since then, a well-known professor and a visiting scholar have both announced they will quit the lab in protest. Students inside the lab have demanded a fuller accounting of Ito's relationship with Epstein. And a current graduate student and former research associate have called on Ito to resign, saying the apology he posted online is not enough.
“Joi isn't a bad person, but he can't lead us," said Arwa Mboya, 25, a graduate researcher studying imagination and technology who is entering her second year at the lab. Despite questions and concerns raised by students, Ito hasn't offered a complete explanation of why he got involved with Epstein.
“He has not been transparent about who, when, and why," Mboya said.
Late Thursday, MIT president L. Rafael Reif said the school had received about $800,000 over two decades via foundations controlled by Epstein, and he apologized to Epstein's victims on behalf of the administration. Reif also convened a committee to investigate the Epstein donations.
Ito did not respond to requests for comment.
In his public apology, Ito said he had traveled to Epstein's homes and accepted money from him for both the research center and Ito's own investments into tech startups. Ito said he first met Epstein in 2013, five years after Epstein had pleaded guilty to soliciting a minor for prostitution and served a year in jail.
“I take full responsibility for my error in judgment," Ito wrote, adding that he would raise an equivalent amount to what Epstein gave the Media Lab and donate it to nonprofits that work with survivors of human trafficking.
He also promised to return the money Epstein invested in his funds.
Ito did not explain the purpose of his visits to Epstein's homes; however, he said he was “never involved in, never heard him talk about, and never saw" evidence of Epstein's alleged crimes.
The revelation has shaken an institute that has deep corporate connections and is credited with innovations that range from the electronic ink in tablet readers to new technology that helps children learn computer programming.
Founded in 1985, the Media Lab holds a unique place on MIT's campus.
It is home to more than 30 faculty and senior researchers and 275 other students and staff. Its $80 million budget is funded primarily by corporate giants including IBM, ExxonMobil, and Google, which gain broad access to the lab's research.
“We could work on whatever we thought was important," said Walter Bender, a founding member and former director of the lab, who left in 2006. “That was a tremendous change from MIT's traditional approach to academics."
The lab's funding formula gives its researchers almost limitless freedom to explore areas ranging from digital currency to the future of food and the ethics of technology.
“It was much more serendipitous, and you could go off and chase a wild idea," Bender said.
Ito was an unconventional choice to lead the lab. A two-time college dropout, from Tufts University and the University of Chicago, he had a successful career as an Internet entrepreneur in Japan, where he was born.
Ito was also an early investor in Twitter, Flickr, and Kickstarter.
According to a nonprofit tax filing by an MIT affiliate, Ito earned $327,640 in 2017.
“Ito was a little bit of a breath of fresh air," Bender said. “He comes from very much of a business focus, an entrepreneurial focus, and that certainly had an impact on the lab."
Ito's investment background and expansive global network also helped the lab raise money and even launch its own venture capital fund.
But his fund-raising has sometimes been controversial. The lab recently cut ties with the private foundation run by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who toured the lab last year during an MIT visit, before he was accused of ordering the killing of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi, according to The New York Times Magazine.
Ethan Zuckerman, director of the lab's Center for Civic Media, who recently announced that he is resigning from the lab in 2020 in protest, said he warned Ito in 2014 not to meet with Epstein.
Epstein had courted prominent academics at other institutions, including Harvard, and had expressed interest in the Media Lab several years before Ito arrived.
Epstein “was sniffing round the lab even when I was there," Bender said. “He was making noises about funding some research" in artificial intelligence.
Bender said he never met Epstein and was not aware of any donations accepted from the financier during his tenure as director.
Controversies about the ethics of accepting money from certain companies or individuals sometimes occurred at the lab, Bender said. But Ito, by taking money from Epstein for the lab as well as his own private investments, “muddied a line that I worked hard to avoid," Bender said.
Ito continues to have support among several students and staff at the Media Lab.
Habib Haddad, a friend of Ito's who has known him for 10 years and helps run the lab's venture fund, said he has heard from many students and faculty who want Ito to remain in place.
“While they are sad and disappointed at Joi's mistakes, they don't want Joi to go and believe he is the right leader to put in place corrective measures and lead the lab," Haddad said. “There is an overwhelming majority — one could say silent majority — that is in support of Joi staying and leading the lab through this."
Other students and scientists at the lab said they are disappointed by the social media-driven effort to push Ito out and believe he should be given a chance to make corrections and help MIT better evaluate when to accept donor funds.
But Kim Holleman, a New York City artist who was a research affiliate at the Media Lab from 2013 to 2017, said last week that Ito must resign.
“Anyone who took any money from Epstein, for whatever reason, has taken rape money," Holleman wrote on Medium. “How on earth can anyone claim to be an intelligent person, smart enough to run MIT Media Lab, but not be smart enough to know the difference between right and wrong?"

Texto completo: To be fair, President Donald Trump hasn't yet referred to himself as a living god.
Almost, though.
At a news conference Wednesday, he looked toward the heavens and referred to himself as "the chosen one" just hours after he approvingly tweeted a quote from a conservative author claiming that Israeli Jews "love him like he's the King of Israel" and "love him like he's the second coming of God."
This further evidence of Trump's messianic complex was nicely coincident with the publication late last month of "Caligula, the Mad Emperor of Rome," a new biography of the famous ancient tyrant by Stephen Dando-Collins.
Dando-Collins describes Caligula as a "changeable, unpredictable and contradictory" leader during his debauched rule of Rome from 37 to 41 A.D., a period during which he made deranged claims of his own divinity. "He was sometimes cowardly and unable to own up to a mistake," he writes. "He considered himself a scholar and master manipulator of words. ... (He) was driven by self-gratification and paranoia and ruled on impulse."
The Roman historian Suetonius, who was born 28 years after Caligula's death, had a similar take, writing of "the astonishing mixture of imbecility and presumption, of moral turpitude and frantic extravagance" in Caligula. Of his character, Suetonius wrote, "it is difficult to say whether weakness of understanding or corruption of morals were more conspicuous."
Caligula -- it's actually a nickname -- means "little boots." His fourth and final wife was named Melonia. He commanded the largest army in the world yet "had never performed even the smallest service to his country," as Suetonius wrote. He reportedly slept only three or four hours a night. He was a vindictive man who never forgot a slight and enjoyed humiliating his adversaries. His promiscuity was legendary.
I know, eerie, right? Dando-Collins went there, asking, "Is Donald Trump the modern Caligula?" in the title of the final chapter of his book. (His answer: "Future historians will make the final judgment.")
Dando-Collins is far from the first to note the parallels: "Trump Makes Caligula Look Pretty Good," was the headline on a New York Times column by Paul Krugman in August 2017. "Mr. President, Your Toga Is Showing," was the headline on a Times op-ed by Christopher Buckley in January 2018 that quoted extensively from Suetonius. And last month, the headline on a Michelle Goldberg column in the Times read "The Caligula Administration Lives On."
Is it a fair and balanced analogy?
Not totally. Caligula was overtly and savagely murderous, killing those who displeased him rather than just dragging them on Twitter. Caligula was "well read and an accomplished public speaker," writes Dando-Collins, noting another difference with Trump. And Caligula raised taxes on his citizens dramatically.
But if Trump is going to continue to hurl the name Pocahontas to impugn the character of rising Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts -- "We will revive it," he promised a crowd at a rally in New Hampshire on Aug. 15 -- then it's fair enough for Democrats to hurl the name Caligula in response.
The tragic details of Pocahontas' life some 400 years ago are immaterial to Trump. She is simply a generic American Indian to him, and he invokes her name to remind voters that Warren vastly inflated, to the point of lying about it, her claims to having Cherokee blood.
Let's pause to note the irony that the compulsively and comprehensively dishonest Trump gets traction with his saucer-eyed supporters when he accuses a political opponent of deception or inauthenticity.
Warren has said she relied on family lore in making claims about her lineage and listing herself as Native American on certain applications. After a DNA test last year showed she's at least six generations removed from Indian ancestors, she withdrew the claim.
Monday she offered a direct public apology during a presidential forum in Iowa, saying to indigenous people, "I am sorry for harm I have caused" and outlining her various plans to improve their lives.
A direct public apology is unlikely to mute the "Pocahontas!" cry from Trump.
But a return cry of "Caligula!" might just drown it out.

Mitch McConnell warns Senate Democrats against abolishing legislative filibuster

Texto completo: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell issued a stern rebuke to Democrats pushing to end the legislative filibuster.
A New York Times op-ed by the Kentucky Republican Thursday offers a detailed defense of the filibuster, which effectively requires any piece of legislative to have at least 60 votes in the 100-member chamber, rather than a bare majority of 51. McConnell's opinion piece comes days after his Democratic predecessor as majority leader, former Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada, called for the filibuster's demise. Reid argued the practice prevents the will of the people from being carried out and is undemocratic.
McConnell disagreed, saying the 60-vote requirement ensures legislation passed by the chamber is the result of compromise and negotiation, not sheer majority whim.
"The legislative filibuster is directly downstream from our founding tradition. If that tradition frustrates the whims of those on the far left, it is their half-baked proposals and not the centuries-old wisdom that need retooling," McConnell wrote.
Warning of the long-term consequences of such a move, McConnell said he and his GOP colleagues "will not vandalize this core tradition" simply because it would benefit them in the short term as they maintain the majority in the Senate.
"We recognize what everyone should recognize — there are no permanent victories in politics. No Republican has any trouble imagining the laundry list of socialist policies that 51 Senate Democrats would happily inflict on Middle America in a filibuster-free Senate," he said.
McConnell also alluded to relatively frequent changes of party control, which can mean today's majority party is tomorrow's minority. Starting with the 1980 elections, Senate majority has shifted seven times (nine if an additional 17-day run of Democratic control in January 2001 is included).
The Senate filibuster has been weakened in recent years thanks to both Republicans and Democrats.
In 2013, the Senate, led by then-Majority Leader Reid, went "nuclear" by eliminating the use of the filibuster on all presidential nominees except for those picked for the Supreme Court. At the time, Democrats accused Republicans of blocking President Barack Obama's nominees in a show of political retribution.
After Republicans took control of the Senate, McConnell removed the 60-vote threshold for Supreme Court nominees in 2017, which paved the way for the confirmation of Justice Neil Gorsuch. Brett Kavanaugh's ascension to the Supreme Court and dozens of lifetime circuit court judges followed.
McConnell pinned the "legacy of the procedural avalanche" squarely on the Democrats and said the "consequences of taking Senator Reid’s advice will haunt liberals for decades."
In his New York Times op-ed last week, Reid, who served as majority leader from 2007 to 2015, argued that the filibuster is "suffocating" the will of the American people, including on issues of climate change and gun control. "Something must change. That is why I am now calling on the Senate to abolish the filibuster in all its forms. And I am calling on candidates seeking the Democratic nomination for president to do the same," he said.
McConnell warned that on legislation deliberation is a "treasured tradition" and removing the filibuster would force the Senate to lose its status as a "safeguard" of the American government to become too much like the House, where a simple majority is all that is needed. "One of the body’s central purposes is making new laws earn broader support than what is required for a bare majority in the House. The legislative filibuster does not appear in the Constitution’s text, but it is central to the order the Constitution sets forth," he said.
Noting how some Democratic leaders in the Senate and candidates running for president are flirting with the idea of eliminating the filibuster, McConnell said he hopes "saner voices among Democrats can help their compatriots see reason."

NEXT UP FOR BAREBONES: GRITTY 'TRUE WEST,' THEN DANCE FEVER

Texto completo: There's something you don't see every day, or every year, for that matter: an announcement of two upcoming barebones productions shows, and one is about preteen dancers.
Patrick Jordan's company hasn't quite gone all feel-good and sparkly on us. The artistic director will follow up the triumphant glitz and grit of "The Legend of Georgia McBride" with Sam Shepard's "True West," a Pulitzer Prize finalist in 1983 about duality in human nature and more in keeping with the barebones' brand.
In an unusual two-for-one announcement, the Braddock-based company also is giving notice that barebones' winter production will be "Dance Nation." Clare Barron's award-winning play about preteen competitive dancers had its world premiere last year at Playwrights Horizons, drawing raves from both The New York Times and Washington Post.
"True West," which opens Sept. 6, is artistic director Jordan's first production "without my mentor and friend Bingo O'Malley to help light the way," he said of the Pittsburgh acting legend, who died on June 2. "But I'm here and I'm ready - it's the last creative project we discussed, and it just adds to my fire for this production."
In "True West," Austin is writing a script that he has sold to a producer, when his brother, Lee, a petty thief, intrudes with his own script idea. Austin is suddenly faced with leaving behind his bleak, modern love story in favor of Lee's trashy Western tale. The New York Times' Ben Brantley, writing in January about the "ripping revival" on Broadway that starred Ethan Hawke and Paul Dano, wrote of the brothers' relationship, "everyday sibling rivalry has seldom felt this ominous."
The play is considered the third in Shepard's trilogy of family dramas, including "Curse of the Starving Class" (1976) and the Pulitzer-winning "Buried Child" (1979).
Jordan directs and plays Lee alongside Gabriel King (barebones' "Lobby Hero," "Small Engine Repair") as Austin. The cast also includes Heidi Mueller Smith and Randy Kovitz ("One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," "Grey Zone") as Hollywood agent Saul.
"True West" will run Sept. 6-29, 8 p.m. Wednesday-Saturday and 3 p.m. Sunday, at the Barebones Black Box, 1211 Braddock Avenue, Braddock. Tickets: $35; $40 at the door; barebonesproductions.com or 1-888-71TICKET. "Dance Nation" is scheduled to run Nov. 22-Dec. 15.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump promised he’d get rid of bad rules.
“Remove the anchor dragging us down!” he said when campaigning for president. “We’re going to cancel every needless job-killing regulation!”
Trump was a developer, so he knew that the thicket of rules government imposes often makes it impossible to get things done.
But would he keep his deregulation promise? I was skeptical.
Republicans often talk deregulation but then add rules. People called President George W. Bush an “anti-regulator.” But once he was president, he hired 90,000 new regulators!
Trump has been different.
When he took office, he hired regulation skeptics. He told government agencies: Get rid of two regulations for every new one you add.
I think his anti-regulation attitude is why stock prices rose and unemployment dropped. Trump sent a message to business: Government will no longer try to crush you. Businesses then started hiring.
Of course, the media wasn’t happy. Reporters love regulation.
They call Trump’s moves “an attack on the environment” and on “workers’ health.” The New York Times ran the headline “Donald Trump Is Trying to Kill You!”
What the media don’t get is that regulations have unintended side effects that often outweigh the good they’re intended to do.
Cars built smaller to comply with President Obama’s rules that require doubling of gas mileage cause increased deaths because smaller cars provide less protection.
“Should the government tell you what kind of car to buy?” asks Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform in my new video about Trump.
Norquist says that Trump has largely kept his deregulation promise, and that’s been great for America.
For example, Trump repealed the Obama-era plan to classify franchise businesses like McDonald’s as one single business. Why?
“The trial lawyers want to be able to sue all of McDonald’s, not just the local McDonald’s, if they spill coffee on themselves,” says Norquist. “And the labor unions want to unionize all McDonald’s, not just the one store. That would have been a disaster.”
Trump’s FCC repealed Obama’s “net neutrality” rule, which would have limited internet providers’ freedom to charge different prices.
Democrats and other regulation-lovers predicted repeal would mean that rich people would dominate the internet. Bernie Sanders even tweeted that repeal would mean “the end of the internet as we know it.”
Of course, none of those things happened. Or as Norquist puts it: “None of it! None of it!”
But some Obama regulations sounded so important.
Norquist laughs at that. “The names for these regulations are written by regulators. They’re advertisements for themselves.”
Of course, unlike advertisers, regulators don’t list side effects of their rules, which Norquist says should read: “May cause unemployment, may reduce wages, may raise the cost of energy, may make your car not drivable.”
Trump’s deregulation record would be better were he not so eager to add regulations, such as tariffs, at the same time.
“There is a challenge. Trump is a protectionist in many ways,” says Norquist, sadly. “Tariffs are taxes, and regulations on the border are regulations on consumers.”
So are Trump’s “buy American” rules.
“That sounds like a good idea, but it’s a dumb idea, and I wish he hadn’t done it,” says Norquist. “That is not deregulation. The good news is that the vast majority of the acts have been deregulatory and tremendously helpful.”
Recently, Trump announced, “We have cut 22 regulations for every new regulation!”
He exaggerated, as he often does. The real number is about five. But that’s still pretty good. Better than Ronald Reagan did.
I wish Trump would do more.
I wish he’d remove his tariffs and agricultural subsidies and kill the Export-Import Bank, drug prohibition and the onerous rules that encourage illegal immigration by making it almost impossible for foreigners to work here legally.
Keep your promise, President Trump! Repeal 22 regulations for every new one!
Nevertheless, so far, mostly good.
Every excessive rule repealed is a step in the right direction: toward freedom.

In Framingham, voters are split on the prospect of a Joe Kennedy run against Ed Markey

Texto completo: FRAMINGHAM — It would be a fight.
Voters at a Wednesday evening town hall meeting hosted by Senator Edward J. Markey were split on the prospect of congressman Joe Kennedy III running against him for the Democratic nomination, a bid Kennedy is said to be considering.
“The whole idea is craziness," said Mike Hugo, a Democrat from Framingham who gave his age as “senior citizen."
“I think it's a shame," he said. “When somebody is doing a great job in office, and someone else wants to step in, I wonder about ego."
Hugo added that he quite likes Kennedy and “thinks he should stay in Congress for now."
But asked about a potential Kennedy challenge, Danny Rizzo of Woburn responded with two words: “good idea!"
The independent-leaning Democrat was angry Markey isn't taking the fight hard enough to President Trump.
“Markey should be much more involved with the bad situations we're in with Trump," he said, shaking his head.
“Markey has done a good job during his years, but," he said, it's time for “young blood," someone who will push back more vociferously against the president.
Even though the town hall was about the Green New Deal — and held in late August, a typically sleepy political month — many of the hundreds of people walking into a Framingham High School auditorium were up-to-date on the prospect of a Kennedy-Markey primary fight. It's a matchup that has riveted Massachusetts since The New York Times reported last week that Kennedy was mulling a 2020 run against Markey.
That story followed news of a poll Kennedy had commissioned over the summer.
A person who has seen the survey's results said Wednesday that it showed Kennedy with a lead over Markey, outside the margin of error. The person said it found Kennedy doing especially well in his district, which stretches from Brookline to Fall River, as well as in other areas, including Boston, Cape Cod, and west of Worcester. Markey, a former representative, showed strength in his old district, which includes suburbs around Boston that are rich with Democratic votes.
Wherever the hypothetical race stands, several voters in Framingham seemed uneasy about the prospect.
Cynthia Ellis, a Democrat from Concord, said she wants to learn more about a potential Kennedy Senate bid. “I think Ed Markey's just a very strong, experienced candidate," Ellis said of the 73-year-old.
Markey has worked to show strength in recent days, as talk of a challenge by Kennedy, 38, grew.
He released an endorsement video from Senator Elizabeth Warren, something that hadn't gone unnoticed by the people filing into Wednesday's gathering.
Maxine Bellew, a retired high school teacher who lives in Marlborough, said both Kennedy and Markey are strong candidates. Markey “is good. I respect him. And he's endorsed by Elizabeth Warren," the 75-year-old said, approvingly. As if to underscore how much the endorsement meant, she said she has “ tremendous respect" for Warren.
And Markey was poised, an aide said, to earn the endorsement on Thursday of the Sunrise Movement, a group of young people devoted to stopping climate change.
Before taking the stage at the town hall, Markey was fired up. “Donald Trump has brought out a fight in me that is stronger than at any point in my career. I'm more energized because of what he poses as a threat to Massachusetts values," Markey told the Globe.
On stage, he spoke at length about several climate issues — he cosponsored the Green New Deal with Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York — as well as gun control. That drew a standing ovation.
Before the event, some voters said they were trying to learn more about how Markey and Kennedy line up on issues, while others seemed to already have a good sense of where the two liberal politicians land.
“I don't see the Kennedys as any more progressive than Markey," said a registered Democrat from Maynard, a 73-year-old woman who declined to give her name.
Kennedy hasn't publicly addressed the prospect of a Senate bid, but a spokeswoman has said he is running for reelection to his House seat — notably using the present tense.
The town hall meeting drew voter questions that ranged from carbon-sequestration technology to vegetarianism to Section 704 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. The event was cohosted by Representative Katherine Clark of Melrose, a member of the congressional delegation who has not endorsed Markey for reelection.
Earlier Wednesday, in an appearance on the radio, she declined to endorse Markey. “I don't have any endorsements to announce today," Clark said on WBUR-FM.
Clark praised Markey for his “incredible leadership" on environmental issues, saying he “has helped us as a country come to understand what's at stake." But she also had kind words for Kennedy.
“Joe Kennedy is also a great colleague and a friend and someone that I am close to," Clark said. “But it's a hypothetical primary at this point. I value them both as great colleagues and mentors, and we will see how this all plays out."
Clark added that “primaries ultimately are up to the voters, and I think both of them have great records to run on."
Clark, a top member of the House Democratic leadership, was first elected in 2013, filling the seat Markey vacated when he won John F. Kerry's Senate seat after Kerry was appointed US secretary of state.

A rich Delawarean tried to buy US senate seat

Texto completo: Caleb R. Layton, longtime Sussex County politician, in an obvious jab at T. Coleman du Pont's offer to build a highway from one end of Delaware to the other, declared in January 1917, "I, for one don't want any millionaire building highways for me ... A better patriotism, a better spirit, would be to put on our statute books a law to make everyman in Delaware pay his just share of the taxes. Then we will have boulevards galore."
According to the Philadelphia Evening Journal, Layton went on to say, "Many other improvements can be made in the state, and it will leave a sweeter taste in the mouth, for we will not be taking bones from a rich man's table."
Two decades earlier, Layton was an ally of millionaire John Edward Addicks, and the Sussex County politician had no qualms about taking "bones from a rich man's table."
Late in the 19th century, before electricity came into common use, cities were lit by natural gas; and John Edward Addicks monopolized the natural gas works in Wilmington and elsewhere, earning the nickname, "Gas" Addicks.
With little political experience, but armed with wads of cash and the scruples of an unregulated capitalist, Addicks launched a bid to become one of Delaware's two United States senators.
The New York Times noted: "He conceived the idea of buying a seat in what was and is in his eyes the finest club in the world. If he had then or has now any idea of entering the Senate as an actual legislator and deliberator, he has kept that idea secret."
In the late 19th century, anyone with a delinquent debt could be barred from voting. Poor residents of Sussex County were also discouraged from voting by a burdensome poll tax.
In addition, when some African-Americans attempted to pay the poll tax, the tax collector closed his office so that the tax could not be paid.
Addicks was no friend to Sussex County's African-American and poor white citizens; but he believed that he could use their desire to vote to his advantage.
As Addicks embarked on his quest to buy a Senate seat, he threw many bones from his rich table. He paid the delinquent debts for a host of voters to earn their support. Addicks paid the poll tax for many poor citizens of Sussex County and enabled many African-Americans to vote for the first time.
To insure that he got what he paid for, Addicks hired workers to "assist" his supporters in the voting booth. At that time, United States senators were elected by the state legislatures, and Addicks tossed his money bones to a number of politicians, including Georgetown's Dr. Caleb R. Layton.
Unlike Addicks, Layton was a consummate politician who held a number of offices in the Republican Party.
When Layton saw the wealthy businessman's growing support among Sussex County voters, the Georgetown politician became the chairman of the Addicks County Committee, the personal representative of Addicks in Sussex County, and a director of the Bay State Gas Company, for which Layton was paid an annual salary of $2,500 a year.
As a director for the gas company, Layton did little or no work, but he earned his salary drumming up support for Addicks.
Addicks' attempt to buy his way into the Senate United ended in failure. The millionaire and Layton had a falling out; and by 1917, Layton was smugly dismissive of the use of private money for public projects, such as the Du Pont Highway; but it was not so long ago that the Sussex politician was taking an annual $2,500 bone from the rich table of John Edward Addicks.

Texto completo: What does it take for a restaurant company to move from behind-the-scenes to center stage? A few big-name chefs.
With that in mind, Restaurant Associates, a firm that has been creating and managing restaurants and corporate dining rooms in New York and beyond since the 1950s, has recently started ramping up its culinary profile.
Well-known chefs are already lending their names and expertise as consultants to the kitchens the company runs: John Fraser has been at the Metropolitan Museum of Art for several months; several weeks ago, Tom Colicchio started creating menus and training the staff at the Morgan Library and Museum.
David Burke is running the restaurant Mojito at the U.S. Open tennis tournament, which begins Aug. 26; and José Andrés has devised the menu for Butterfly, a tacos and tortas stand at the Open. Dominique Ansel, best known as a pastry chef, will expand his repertoire at a location yet to be decided.
Restaurant Associates, based in New York City, is among the country's largest operators of museum cafes. (It runs the cafeteria in The New York Times Building.) It also runs L'Avenue, the Parisian transplant in the Saks Fifth Avenue flagship store, where the pastry chef Pierre Hermé is designing the desserts, and it collaborated with Tiffany & Co. to create the chic Blue Box Café, which has a daily waiting list of about 2,000 names.
This lineup is making the company more than a management firm that simply prints the menus and sees to table settings.
It's also a return to form. In its early decades, Restaurant Associates was known as a major innovative force in New York's dining scene. The restaurateur Joe Baum created highly regarded theme restaurants for the company, like the original Four Seasons, La Fonda del Sol, Brasserie, the Forum of the Twelve Caesars and Tropica, all of which provided cachet to office buildings, a trend still followed by real estate developers. The company started and ran the Zum Zum wurst bars and revived Mamma Leone's, a tourist magnet.
Mr. Baum was named head of the specialty restaurant division, and in 1963 became the company's president; he tapped James Beard to be a consultant, especially for the American menu at the Four Seasons.
By the 1980s a number of its restaurants remained in business, and it was running catered events and the dining rooms in museums, cultural centers, offices and sporting arenas. For the public, however, its name had lost its luster.
Restaurant Associates is valued at $ 950 million, and since 1998 has been a member of the Compass Group, a global food service company, but it is now aiming higher. It wants to turn its restaurants into destinations, like they were in the past, not just convenient places for a bite before a concert or after an hour of Rembrandt.
The chef Ed Brown, who was named as president for restaurants in 2017, has a mission to place greater emphasis on the quality of the food. "We're building strong relationships with the chefs," he said. "We're treating them like partners." Mr. Brown was once the executive chef at the Sea Grill in Rockefeller Center, a restaurant originally created and run by Restaurant Associates.
"Over the years we lost chefs to other companies, and they're coming back now that they see we have a culture of chefs and culinary excellence," said Dick Cattani, the chief executive.
Mr. Colicchio said he agreed to work with the Morgan Library's cafe and dining room, which Restaurant Associates runs, because he had done some consulting work for the firm on food waste.
Next on the agenda are a club on the 89th floor of the One World Trade Center tower; a Korean restaurant and event space in New York's meatpacking district; a renovated Café on 3 at the Guggenheim Museum; a restaurant in the new Gilder Center for Science, Education and Innovation at the American Museum of Natural History; and a restaurant and bar in a new visitor center at Longwood Gardens in Pennsylvania.
There will be chefs involved, names you know.

Texto completo: What's Streaming
AMERICAN FACTORY Stream on Netflix. The first release from Barack and Michelle Obama's new production company, Higher Ground Productions, looks at what happens when an automotive glass factory owned by a Chinese billionaire opens in what was once a General Motors plant near Dayton, Ohio. Directed by Steven Bognar and Julia Reichert, the documentary focuses on American and Chinese workers at the plant, laying out the challenges and frustrations they face as their initial optimism is challenged. "With detail and sweep, interviews and you-are-there visuals, the filmmakers quickly establish a clear, strong narrative line as the new enterprise -- Fuyao Glass America -- gets off the ground," Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times. "The optimism of the workers is palpable; the access the filmmakers secured remarkable. Bognar and Reichert spent a number of years making 'American Factory,' a commitment that's evident in its layered storytelling and the trust they earned."
SCHOOL GIRLS; OR, THE AFRICAN MEAN GIRLS PLAY Stream on Thirteen.org. High school hierarchy, a beauty pageant and Bobby Brown are all ingredients in this play, which was filmed in Manhattan last year during an MCC Theater production. It was recently broadcast on PBS as part of Theater Close Up and is now available to stream. The show depicts "Mean Girls"-esque backbiting at a Ghana boarding school, where the arrival of a new student, Ericka (Joanna A. Jones), upends the teenage social order. The quick, sharp and hilarious ensemble play off a script that evokes, in addition to "Mean Girls," other movies like "Heathers," "Jawbreaker" and "Legally Blonde" that use school cliques as a source of both laughs and love-to-hate outrage. "Something fascinating happens when the author, Jocelyn Bioh, a New York playwright and actor, applies those templates to the world of her parents, who emigrated from Ghana in 1968," Jesse Green wrote in his review for The Times. "The nasty-teen comedy genre emerges wonderfully refreshed and even deepened by its immersion in a world it never considered."
A SIMPLE FAVOR (2018) Stream on Amazon. The director Paul Feig might be most closely associated with the rebooted "Ghostbusters" and the dirty comedy of "Bridesmaids." But he took a darker turn here, directing a mystery adapted from the novel by Darcey Bell. Anna Kendrick plays Stephanie, a widow whose mild fixation with her new friend, Emily (Blake Lively), becomes not-so-mild when Emily goes missing. In her review for The Times, Manohla Dargis called the movie "a female-friendship comedy with neo-noir ambitions," writing that, despite two well-synchronized stars, the movie "starts stalling out as the narrative feints and dodges increase."
What's on TV
HIGHER LEARNING (1995) 6 p.m. on BET. This third feature from the director John Singleton delves into race relations on a 1990s college campus, telling the story of three freshmen (played by Omar Epps, Michael Rapaport and Kristy Swanson) whose lives intermittently overlap as they move toward a haunting climax.

Missing Worker From Britain's Hong Kong Consulate May Be Held in China

Texto completo: HONG KONG -- China has detained an employee of the British Consulate in Hong Kong after he crossed the border into the mainland, his family and his girlfriend said, raising fears that the Chinese authorities might be targeting travelers they suspect of supporting the Hong Kong protests.
The apparent detention of the employee, Cheng Man Kit, a trade officer for the consulate, was striking in that it highlighted many of the fears that ignited the protests. The demonstrations began in June over a bill that would allow extradition to mainland China, which critics said would put the city's residents at risk of facing the murky judicial Chinese system controlled by the Communist Party.
Mr. Cheng, who is 28 and also goes by the name Simon, traveled to Shenzhen, the city just across the border from Hong Kong, to attend a business conference on Aug. 8, but did not return the same day as planned, his family said in a statement on Wednesday morning. It said a lawyer had confirmed his detention in Shenzhen but not the reasons for it, nor his whereabouts.
He exchanged messages with his girlfriend, Annie Li, even as he was heading back to the border that night aboard the recently opened high-speed railway that links Shenzhen to Hong Kong. "Passing through," he wrote to her in English on WeChat, the Chinese message app, at 10:42. "Pray for me." As of Tuesday, he had not been heard from since.
Britain's Foreign and Commonwealth Office said in a statement on Tuesday that it was providing support to Mr. Cheng's family and seeking further information from the authorities in Hong Kong and in the Chinese province of Guangdong, which includes Shenzhen.
"We are extremely concerned by reports that a member of our team has been detained returning to Hong Kong from Shenzhen," the statement said.
China's police and judiciary routinely operate in secrecy, and the security authorities in Guangdong did not respond to inquiries about the case. A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Geng Shuang, said at a regularly scheduled briefing in Beijing that he had no knowledge about Mr. Cheng's disappearance. Asked again, Mr. Geng said, "I don't have any understanding of this matter."
It was not clear whether Mr. Cheng had participated in any of the Hong Kong protests. As the protests have intensified, however, officials in China have repeatedly blamed other countries, including Britain, for fomenting unrest. That could have made him a target for security services.
A 42-page document that the Foreign Ministry provided to The New York Times on Tuesday said, "Certain forces in the U.S. and Britain have deliberately ignored extreme violence in the illegal protests and attempted to beautify mobsters as campaigners of 'freedom, democracy and human rights."'
Mr. Cheng, a Hong Kong resident, worked for the consulate's branch of Scottish Development International, a trade and investment promotion office, according to family members and his Facebook biography.
He holds a British national overseas passport, which entitles him to consular representation but does not allow him to work or live in Britain. China does not recognize that status, which Britain created for Hong Kong residents before it returned the city to Chinese control in 1997.
Mr. Cheng's disappearance, first reported by HK01, an online Hong Kong news organization, prompted calls for another protest, this time in front of the British Consulate on Wednesday evening.
"The Beijing authority wants to create a chilling effect," said Michael Mo, one of the organizers, who knows Mr. Cheng. "It is a reminder that whether the extradition bill is passed or not, there are still ways that the authorities can find to harass you by whatever means."
Mr. Cheng's family reported him missing on Aug. 9. The next day, an official in Hong Kong's immigration office "told us that Simon has been administratively detained, but said that they could obtain no information on why, where and for how long he was to be detained," the family's statement said.
Under Chinese law, suspects held in administration detention can be held for up to 15 days without court hearings or access to lawyers. Relatives are supposed to be notified, but the family said they had received no information.
"Simon's disappearance and detention without any reason will create panic among the investors and entrepreneurs globally," Ms. Li, his girlfriend, wrote in a statement.
"We just want Simon to come home," she said by telephone. "We don't want anything else."
Chinese border officers have stepped up checks on people crossing the border from Hong Kong. They have begun routinely searching the phones of people who enter the mainland from Hong Kong, apparently to identify people sympathetic to the protest movement and to prevent photographs or other information about the demonstrations from spreading to the mainland.
Immigration and police officials in Hong Kong did not disclose any details about Mr. Cheng.
"This case is currently being handled by the regional missing person unit in Kowloon West," a police spokesman, Kong Wing Cheung, said at a news briefing on Tuesday, referring to the neighborhood that includes the new high-speed railway station. The Hong Kong police, like the family, said they had not received any official notices about the case from the mainland authorities.

Texto completo: Question isn't if there will be a recession, it's when. President Donald Trump hopes it won't happen before the next election and I hope WVU wins the Big 12. Looking doubtful for both of us. For him it's because the economy depends more on how we think things are going to be rather than the way they are. For me, well, I've been a Mountaineer fan too long. Nonetheless, let's focus on the recession. Here are my thoughts.
The gross domestic product is like total sales. It's the value of all goods and services produced by all businesses located in the United States.
A recession is commonly defined as sales being down two consecutive quarters. In July, we learned that U.S. GDP increased at the annualized rate of 2.1 percent in the second quarter, down from the first quarter's 3.1 percent annualized growth.
There have been 11 recessions since World War II. On average, they lasted 11.1 months, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. The shortest was six months (1980) and is often counted with the 1981-82 recession, while the longest lasted 18 months (2007-09). The economy typically shrinks about 1.4 percent, on average, over two quarters before growth resumes.
What's the impact? To most of us, it's unemployment. Since World War II, unemployment peaked twice during recessions at 10.8 percent (November 1982) and 10.0 percent (October 2009). However, most recessions have had a lesser effect on unemployment, such as 6.3 percent in June 2003 and 7.8 percent in June 1992, although that's still almost double last month's 3.7 percent unemployment rate.
What causes a recession? Different recessions are blamed on different causes, but reduced consumer confidence always is a factor. A well-paid coal miner concerned with whether the company will be in business next year might avoid major purchases. If enough of us think that way, then the GDP goes down because we stop buying.
One financial measure of this pessimism is when the bond yield curve inverts. That's comparing the amount of interest the Treasury must pay to attract long-term loans (10-year Treasury notes) versus short-term (three-month Treasury bills).
In optimistic times, consumers know they can pay 5 percent now (short-term) and think they can afford to pay more on a longer-term loan because they'll be making more money in the future. So, the Treasury must pay more interest long-term to attract investors.
In pessimistic times, consumers still may be willing to pay 5 percent short-term, but will avoid long-term obligations because they're unsure of the long-term. That allows the Treasury to reduce the interest they pay to attract enough long-term investors, sometimes to less than what they pay for short-term money.
And that's a yield curve inversion. It's happened before every recession since 1955, although it sometimes happens months or years before. And it happened again last week.
But that's just one factor.
The second-quarter GDP contracted in the United Kingdom and markets are jittery because a bad Brexit break up could depress the third quarter, throwing them into recession.
In Italy, "An economy that has not expanded over the past decade stagnated between April and June ... while investment diminished, reported The New York Times.
Germany's second-quarter GDP shrank, compared with the previous quarter, and has been flat for a year.
Mexico narrowly escaped a recession with minimal second-quarter growth, but weaknesses persist.
Brazil's economy decreased in the first quarter and China's massive economy ($12.24 trillion vs. U.S. $19.39 trillion) grew at its slowest pace (6.2 percent) since 1992 as the country wages a trade war started by Trump.
Finally, the International Monetary Fund cut its 2019 global growth forecast to 3.2 percent, citing the U.S.-China trade war, other U.S. threats of sanctions on other countries and Brexit-related uncertainties.
So, when will we see a recession? No one knows for sure, but I bet it will be before WVU wins the Big 12 football championship.

Trump-Miller, la mancuerna del mal

Texto completo: Durante el fin de semana, dos de los principales diarios de Estados Unidos, The New York Times y The Washington Post, dedicaron artículos de primera plana a la polémica figura del asesor presidencial, Stephen Miller, el principal arquitecto de la política antiinmigrante del gobierno de Donald Trump.
Nada de lo descrito sorprende a quienes abogamos por los derechos de los inmigrantes, pues el siniestro Miller ya había dejado su marca cuando trabajó para legisladores republicanos en el Congreso, particularmente para el exsenador de Alabama y venido a menos exsecretario de Justicia, Jeff Sessions, otra de las figuras más antiinmigrantes del Partido Republicano.
Miller es uno de los funcionarios que ha sobrevivido en el gobierno de Trump, cuando otros no han corrido la misma suerte. Y es muy probable que se deba a que comparte con el presidente el mismo desdén contra las minorías étnicas, particularmente los hispanos aunque sean ciudadanos, contra los inmigrantes, con o sin documentos, y una particular aversión hacia los refugiados.
Porque queda claro que la retórica antiinmigrante de Trump, la política pública resultante y los proyectos impulsados están dirigidos a minorías, inmigrantes y refugiados de color. Nunca hemos oído a Trump o a Miller despotricar contra indocumentados blancos.
Sus intenciones de “blanquear” una nación que ellos ven amenazada por los cambios demográficos, que nos llevan aceleradamente a ser un país donde las minorías serán mayorías, se sustentan en el racismo y en la falsa idea de que esas minorías suponen una amenaza para su existencia y supervivencia.
Y digo falsa, porque en todos los indicadores los anglosajones siguen gozando de una situación privilegiada; sin ignorar, claro está, que, como en todos los grupos étnicos, hay sectores blancos golpeados por el desempleo, los bajos salarios, la falta de seguro médico y problemas sociales. De todos modos, ser blancos les sigue suponiendo una ventaja, ante los obstáculos que enfrentan las minorías menos privilegiadas.
Pero en lugar de tener un debate sincero sobre las causas de las desigualdades —provocadas incluso por las mismas políticas que impulsa Trump, por ejemplo, una reducción tributaria que en realidad solo beneficia a ricos, y ofensivas contra el Obamacare que dejaría sin seguro médico a millones—, lo más sencillo es buscar un chivo expiatorio. Y esos son los inmigrantes y las minorías de color.
Pero es más truculento porque la agenda que impulsan Trump y Miller es la misma de los supremacistas blancos que ven en la inmigración y en el crecimiento de las minorías una amenaza a su supervivencia.
Los mecanismos no importan, así sea separar familias, enjaular niños y bebés, privarlos de sus padres, no proveerle a esos menores los productos más básicos como jabón, pasta de dientes o una cobija para dormir. O extraviar a esos menores en la madeja burocrática. O como se reportó este pasado fin de semana, explorar la idea de negar la educación a niños indocumentados, lo cual iría en contra de un fallo de 1982 de la Corte Suprema que garantiza el acceso de indocumentados al sistema de educación pública.
Miller es también el artífice de la regla sobre “carga pública” y de todas las políticas antiinmigrantes de Trump, comenzando con el veto musulmán.
Es sabido que el Partido Republicano es cómplice de Trump y de Miller por su silencio. Trump no enfrenta ninguna resistencia interna, porque mientras los republicanos coloquen a los jueces conservadores que quieren y mientras la economía los favorezca, poco importa lo que diga o haga el presidente.
La pregunta es si la estrategia antiinmigrante y racista funcionará en la elección general de 2020. No fue el caso de los comicios intermedios de 2018, cuando los demócratas ganaron la mayoría en la Cámara Baja y varias gubernaturas en distritos y estados que en 2016 favorecieron a Trump. Diversos sondeos señalan que la retórica y las políticas prejuiciosas de Trump no gozan del apoyo de la mayoría de los estadounidenses.
Pero los demócratas todavía no cuentan con un abanderado o abanderada, y eso también definirá el curso de las elecciones presidenciales.
Lo que sí es evidente es que el Partido Republicano que conocíamos ya no existe. El último presidente republicano en impulsar una reforma migratoria y en tratar de hacer más incluyente a esa colectividad fue George W. Bush, quien ocupó la Casa Blanca hasta el 20 de enero de 2009, cuando Barack Obama juramentó su primer mandato.
Los sectores republicanos más antiinimigrantes se consideraban marginales en esa época, pero en solo una década se han colocado a la cabeza del partido, al grado que es comandado por Trump, la figura republicana más divisiva y racista en la historia reciente, y su copiloto Miller. Peor aún, Trump tiene el apoyo de 90% del Partido Republicano.
No sé si los conservadores más moderados buscarán refugio temporal con los demócratas o los independientes; si fundarán otra colectividad ahora que la suya ha sido secuestrada por los antiinmigrantes; o si ya el Partido Republicano rebasó el punto donde no hay retorno.
Lo que sí queda claro es que Trump y Miller, la mancuerna del mal, todavía tienen año y medio para seguir haciendo daño, con la posibilidad de cuatro años más, si Trump es reelecto.

Texto completo: Senator Elizabeth Warren on Tuesday proposed a host of new initiatives in a sweeping overhaul of the nation's criminal justice system, outlining changes that would affect policies ranging from school discipline to sentencing guidelines to the use of force by police.
Warren released her plan just days after 2020 Democratic rival Senator Bernie Sanders outlined his proposals on the hot-button campaign issue, with the Vermont senator setting an ambitious goal of cutting the prison population in half. Warren highlighted inequities in the criminal justice system ahead of a forum she will attend on the issue in Minnesota on Tuesday.
“It's not equal justice when a kid with an ounce of pot can get thrown in jail, while a bank executive who launders money for a drug cartel can get a bonus. It's long past time for us to reform our system," Warren wrote in a lengthy post on the Medium website.
Similar to her approach on voting rights, Warren's plan relies on the use of federal money as leverage to encourage local law enforcement and local prosecutors to adopt many of her changes.
On policing, Warren would implement a federal standard for the use of force that would apply to federal law enforcement, and use federal money to encourage local departments to adopt other changes, including the use of body cameras by police and an end to “stop-and-frisk" policies. She also called for local police to “demilitarize" and would eliminate a Defense Department program used to transfer unused military equipment to police departments.
Warren would support measures to make it easier for people to sue police departments when their civil rights have been violated. Her plan would also increase resources for mental health care and support programs for police officers, who experience higher rates of suicide and trauma-related disorders than the general public.
The proposals on policing come as the Massachusetts senator was recently criticized by a union representing Massachusetts police officers over her description of the death of Michael Brown, whose death sparked a national conversation on police violence in the African-American community, as a murder.
Much of Warren's plan focuses on helping people avoid interaction with the criminal justice system, beginning with how schools discipline students. Calling it a part of the school-to-prison pipeline, Warren would decriminalize truancy and instead focus on boosting resources for mental health care in schools. The proposal highlights an issue that has been a problem for Senator Kamala Harris, who ran a program as a prosecutor in San Francisco that used threats of jail time to pressure parents of truant kids.
Highlighting another dividing line among the 2020 Democratic presidential primary field, Warren argued for repealing the 1994 crime bill that set mandatory minimum sentences for many nonviolent drug offenses and that critics say ushered in the present-day era of mass incarceration. That legislation was championed by then-Senator Joe Biden, and he has defended it as he campaigns for president, although his criminal justice plan would reverse portions of it.
A new advisory board on criminal justice that Warren would create would include people who have been formerly incarcerated alongside victims of violence to “listen to the needs of those who have first-hand experience with the system." Another proposal would change the way the president determines who gets a reduced sentence or pardon by establishing a board that would search for deserving cases and make clemency recommendations directly to the White House. Warren said the current Department of Justice-led structure “results in relatively few and conservative clemency recommendations."
Warren's plan would eliminate the practice of requiring defendants to post cash bail and reduce the fees associated with courts, which she argues only serve to criminalize poverty.
“A simple misdemeanor like a speeding ticket shouldn't be enough to send someone spiraling into poverty or worse," Warren wrote.
Warren would implement another set of reforms that would address the conditions of those already incarcerated, including eliminating solitary confinement and assigning transgender individuals to facilities that match their gender identity.
Warren's plan also boosts funding for public defenders and makes it easier for people to challenge their detention in federal court.
“It is a false choice to suggest a tradeoff between safety and mass incarceration," she wrote.

Peter Fonda: Worthy Moments on a Long Ride

Texto completo: Peter Fonda, who died on Friday at age 79, would have been famous even if he'd never made a movie. As the son of the actor Henry Fonda, the brother of the actress Jane Fonda and the father of the actress Bridget Fonda, he was part of an accomplished Hollywood family. But he made his own profound contributions to the Fonda legacy as director, producer and performer. In the late 1960s and early '70s in particular, thanks to movies like "Easy Rider" and "Dirty Mary Crazy Larry," Fonda accrued a kind of outlaw mystique, putting his own countercultural spin on the lanky, laconic western characters his father once played.
Later in his career, in acclaimed performances in films like "Ulee's Gold" and "The Limey," Fonda traded on that persona, playing a grizzled, fading version of the hippies he embodied decades earlier. With his deep, even-toned voice, his angular face and his soulful blue eyes, he had a one-of-a-kind screen presence, which he put to use in many classic films throughout his life.
The online database IMDB credits Fonda with 116 roles. Here are seven of the best, along with where to stream them.
'The Wild Angels' (1966)
How to watch: Buy or rent it on Amazon and Vudu.
After getting his start in theater and television in New York in the early 1960s, Fonda caught the attention of Hollywood producers, who tried to package him as a dashing lead in soapy romances like "Tammy and the Doctor." But the actor was more interested in drugs, rebellion and rock 'n' roll. He found a vehicle for his values in "The Wild Angels," a motorcycle filled "youthsploitation" picture directed by the indie film entrepreneur Roger Corman. The movie's story about a rampaging gang resembles the moralistic juvenile delinquent melodramas of the previous decade; but Corman adopts a less judgmental tone. Fonda's intense, no-frills depiction of a hard-living biker helped popularize a new kind of screen antihero.

'Easy Rider' (1969)
How to watch: Stream it on Crackle; buy or rent it on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube.
Corman and Fonda followed up "The Wild Angels" with the 1967 LSD drama "The Trip," in which Fonda worked alongside Dennis Hopper. Hopper and Fonda then decided to capitalize on American moviegoers' growing fascination with dopers and bikers by collaborating as actors and as filmmakers on what they conceived as the ultimate motorcycle movie. In "Easy Rider," the two replace a lot of the genre's violence with psychedelic interludes, along with docu-realistic dispatches from the country's widening generation gap. Fonda's poised, dignified character, Wyatt, adds an element of spiritual yearning to the film that even non-hippies at the time could relate to.

'Dirty Mary Crazy Larry' (1974)
How to watch: Buy or rent it on Amazon, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube.
Fonda settled into a career as a drive-in movie star in the 1970s, bringing his low-key charisma and famous name to a lot of low-ambition car-chase movies and revenge thrillers. "Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry" is one of the most fun of the bunch, with Fonda playing a racecar driver who robs a supermarket with his buddy (Adam Roarke) and an ex-lover (Susan George), and then speeds through rural California with cop cars and helicopters on his tail. With his big sunglasses and beatific grin, Fonda cuts a figure as memorably cool as his '60s biker characters.
[Read the New York Times review.]
'Race With the Devil' (1975)
How to watch: Buy or rent it on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube.
Just as "Easy Rider" offered an elevated, artier version of the illicit thrills in "The Wild Angels," so "Race with the Devil" is like "Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry" but with a sublimely devilish twist. This time out, Fonda plays a dirt bike enthusiast, who along with his business partner (Warren Oates) and their wives (Loretta Swit and Lara Parker) accidentally discovers a satanic conspiracy out in the sticks. Soon the couples are driving for their lives in a souped-up R.V. that keeps them one step ahead of the occultists. It's a dynamic like the one in "Easy Rider," but the bikers are the respectable types and the country folk are the freaks.
[Read the New York Times review.]
'Ulee's Gold' (1997)
How to watch: Buy or rent it on Vudu.
Fonda received his only best actor Oscar nomination for this fine character drama, written and directed by the Florida filmmaker Victor Nuñez. In it, Fonda plays an aging beekeeper who is already overwhelmed with his family and work responsibilities when the story begins, and he gets even deeper in over his head when his son's criminal past puts his household in danger. It's a remarkably nuanced performance from Fonda, whose Ulee spends a lot of time quietly thinking through his problems and pondering his mistakes, in scenes as gripping as any shootout.
[Read the New York Times review.]
'The Limey' (1999)
How to watch: Buy or rent it on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes and YouTube.
Several filmmakers have made use of Fonda's stature and reputation as a beloved '60s survivor -- often for parodic purposes -- but none did it better than Steven Soderbergh, who cast Fonda as a venerable Los Angeles music-industry honcho with a lucrative sideline as a drug smuggler. Terence Stamp plays the British ex-con with a score to settle, in an impressionistic crime picture that doubles as a moody meditation on the glories of the past and the squandered potential of the Love Generation.
[Read the New York Times review.]
'3:10 to Yuma' (2007)
How to watch: Buy or rent it on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube.
Fonda didn't make as many westerns as his father did, but he did direct and star in the excellent 1971 cowboy picture "The Hired Hand" (not available to stream at the moment). Late in his career, he added some earthy authenticity to the director James Mangold's remake of "3:10 to Yuma." As a Pinkerton agent trying to help bring a train robber to justice, he calls back to the lived-in grit and gravitas of the old western character actors. The movie is like something from an alternate Hollywood history, in which Fonda spent more time on horses than on motorcycles.

Texto completo: Former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams maintains she will not concede the recent election because it would mean she was admitting the process was fair.
Abrams, who recently announced she is not running for president in 2020 to instead focus on voting rights advocacy, told CBS News on Monday, "Concession means to say that the process was fair."
"But when I run an organization, that in 10 days, between election night and the night I refused to concede, we received more than 50,000 phone calls of people who were denied the right to vote. I am complicit if I say that system is fair," she continued.
Abrams added she is not claiming to be the governor of Georgia, but, "I have said is we won the battle of making sure more voices were heard because we had the highest record turnout in Georgia history for Democrats."
As evidence of voter suppression, Abrams offered the fact that current Gov. Brian Kemp, who was Georgia's secretary of state during the election, "was in charge of the process."
iFrame Object
When Abrams was speaking at the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades convention last week, she called Kemp the "architect of voter suppression" that "we won" because of the record voter turnout.
Kemp received 50.2% of the vote during the 2018 midterms, with Abrams receiving 48.8% of the vote, according to the New York Times.

Texto completo: Aug. 19 in history:
On Aug. 19, 1812, the U.S. frigate Constitution, Old Ironsides, defeated the British ship Guerriere during the War of 1812.
On Aug. 19, 1934, Germans voted to make Adolf Hitler Fuhrer, their word for "leader" or "guide."
On Aug. 19, 1902, a Richmond press release made the front page of the New York Times. The headline read: HE WANTED TO SHUT OUT THE WORLD – AND HE DID! – The story read: "Harry N. Blaine, who was once private secretary to House of representative James G. Blaine, is now a recluse in Indiana spending his time at a Brookville lake. He says he desires to end his life away from the world and does not wish to communicate with relatives. His aim was to spend his last years peaceably, saying while his fishing rod may have to be pried from his rigor mortised fingers, he prefers to be buried with it rather than to return to politics."
On Aug. 19, 1863, Dr. Samuel S. Boyd of Centerville, part of the 84th Indiana Regiment that formed in Wayne County, wrote home from Estell Springs, Tenn., revealing that Holy Scripture did not condemn the Union: "Since my last missive we have changed our base of operations. This was of a military necessity and strategy, as chickens and roasting ears were becoming scarce ...Our new camp is beautifully situated on the north bank of the Elk River, which is a love of a stream about large as the West River in Connersville. Our lookout is grand. On the southeast we can see the Cumberland Mountains stretching out for fifty miles in length, beautifully undulating against the horizon.... The railroad bridge which spans the Elk River, 600 feet long and 60 feet high, was burnt by Confederate General Braxton Bragg's men after their retreat. Our engineers rebuilt it with heavy timbers in seven days. This serves to show home critics the tardy movements of large armies and the difficulties we have to overcome, and the results we achieve, and the speed with which we have to accomplish what needs to be done! At home they read the newspapers in the smoke of "a long nine"* with their heels higher than their surplus of brains, in thinking just about what labor is required to construct a railroad bridge, as high and three times as long as the one at Richmond, and this is done in enemy country 300 miles from the base of supplies, and even further away from home! After having duly considered the above, they still insist that we ought to fight at least two great battles per day, and wind the thing up at once! Blah!
"...Five hundred prisoners are now at work in the Cumberland mountains cutting a new road for our army to pass with supply trains. That is our next trick.
"...The truth is it is not describable that this war should be very speedily closed. Many in the North and still more in the South are not ready for peace. Pharaoh Jeff Davis is not willing to let the children of Israel Southern slaves depart in peace. The famine, the flies and the lice they already have, but the locusts, boils, frogs and storms of hail are yet to come... Many of the best and most intelligent of the people here in this portion of Tennessee appear to have but a faint conception of the sinfulness of the Rebellion and of the righteousness of its suppression. One smart lady who has sons in the Union army one day recent told me, 'I always submit to the powers that be, to whoever is in charge. When General Bragg was here, I was for the Confederacy, but now that he is gone, the Union is the powers that be and I am for the Union army. Saint Paul says you must submit to the powers there be, and I always try to obey Scripture!'
"Our Chaplain who was present and very convenient when theological waters became too deep for me, intervened to say, 'Do not the Scriptures teach that the powers that be are of God?'
"'Yes, 'said the lady, 'but I nevertheless never try to reconcile contradictory texts of Scripture!'
"Another lady whose house I visited to see a sick member of her family, and who was decidedly against the Union, told me that the war was prophesied by the prophet Joel, whence she stuck chapter II, 20th verse in my face, and I read: 'But he will remove far of from you the northern army and you will drive him unto a land barren and desolate, with his face toward the east seas and his hinder part toward the outermost seas, and his stink shall come up and his ill savor shall arise!'
"Here she acclaimed was a plain indisputable text of Scripture to the point, and no Chaplain close by for me to turn to, so what was I to do? In desperation I studied the doxology diligently for the next twenty minutes, thumbing pages, and found what I had suspected before, that the context did not sustain any inference that the 'northern army' quoted was our brave Union army, for Lincoln hirelings were not once mentioned one d-mned time! I told her so and she did not like it!" - Yours - Dr. Samuel S. Boyd, 84th Indiana.
(* Long Nine: a term of disparagement meaning men of less than average height, shorter than Lincoln, who are loafers, drinkers, liars, profaners, thieves, flatulent expellers, lily livered chicken-hearted malingering shirkers - & gutless yellow belly cowards!)

The 84th Indiana mustered into service on Sept. 3, 1862, in Richmond. This was the fifth local regiment formed in Wayne County. The men fought in thirteen major engagements, having left for the field with an aggregate of 949 officers and men, and returning with 349 men and 22 officers, suffering a staggering 39% loss, or almost four out of ten who did not return.

Texto completo: One of the most inflammatory developments in America's ongoing cultural conflict has been the decision of so-called "woke capital" to use its considerable commercial power to threaten or impose economic sanctions on American states that implement public policies it doesn't like.
We've seen this play out many, many times - from boycotts against Indiana when it had the audacity to expand religious-liberty protections in the state, to punitive measures against North Carolina after it passed its so-called "bathroom bill," and to threats against Georgia in opposition to its own religious-liberty bill and then its abortion restrictions. Progressive corporate America has made its position clear: It will take a moral stand, even if that stand potentially hurts the bottom line.
It's always been hard to take that position seriously, however, when many of the same companies happily do immense amounts of business in the People's Republic of China, a regime that systematically and ruthlessly crushes dissent. In China, the boycotts and bold stands are few and far between. Instead, there are glittering movie premieres, gleaming new factories, and intense marketing campaigns - all aimed at opening up one of the world's most lucrative markets.
But are there limits? As we watch Hong Kong police beat pro-democracy protesters and as Twitter fills with images of police and military force massing near the border, will corporate America remember its morals? Will it use its commercial and cultural power to punish China if the government intervenes? Or will it be business as usual for America's woke corporate giants?
Yes, President Donald Trump should speak clearly and forcefully in favor of Hong Kong's pro-democracy protesters. His equivocation and ambiguity have been frustrating and shameful. Yes, there are concrete actions our government can take if China cracks down, but Congress and the president are not the only Americans with influence or with significant ties to Beijing.
For a long time, the communists in China have been able to enjoy the bounties of commercial and cultural engagement with corporate America while continuing their brutal, unjust reign over an oppressed people. American companies have long looked the other way so long as the dollars rolled in. It's time for that indulgence to end. It's time for all of the powerful components of American society to send a unified message - hands off Hong Kong, or China will pay a price greater than it may want to bear.

Texto completo: To the Editor:
Re "A Future Without the Front Page" ("The Last Edition," special section, Aug. 4):
It was good to see The New York Times focusing attention on the alarming decline in local news and ideas for reversing it. One important point needs to be highlighted: the proper and crucial role philanthropy should play. At the heart of the crisis is a collapse in revenue that funded the commercial model for local news.
When the market fails and critical services go wanting, philanthropy must step up as a loss leader to help finance the reinvention of local news as a public service. The old model for journalism produced huge cash flows that traditionally underwrote great local journalism. Reinvention requires making available the time, capital and level of risk taking that simply does not exist in the commercial market but fits squarely in the mission of philanthropy.
Imagine if every foundation in the country devoted just 1 percent of its giving each year to building journalism capacity. That would be about $ 600 million -- far short of the revenues lost to digital disruption, but enough to give local news innovation the runway to reinvent the industry.
At the Revson Foundation, we have been following this model for 10 years. It works, as executives at Chalkbeat, WNYC, THE CITY, ProPublica and City Limits can attest. In the same way that philanthropists built our great cultural institutions, hospitals and universities that the market alone could not support, philanthropy must continue to play this vital leadership role for local journalism.

To the Editor:
In Ohio, 32 percent of our newspapers have closed since 2004. By month's end, The Vindicator will join them, making Youngstown the largest American city without a paper.
The remaining papers keep producing important journalism, but with a fraction of the resources. Ohio lost 43 percent of its newspaper journalists (reporters, editors, photographers and designers) between 2012 and 2018. That's fewer people monitoring the city council, checking court dockets and scrutinizing school board meetings. Studies have linked newspaper closures to lower voter turnout, higher municipal debt and even more pollution.
This crisis demands public policy intervention. State lawmakers should increase support for public broadcasting and look to New Jersey, which created a publicly funded consortium supporting local journalism. Federally, Congress can make it easier for newspapers to become nonprofits. We should also tax Facebook and Google, which get the lion's share of digital ad revenue and benefit from newspaper-created content. The revenue generated can also support journalism.
Let's move past the hand-wringing and toward solutions.

To the Editor:
As a subscriber to the print New York Times and my local Desert Sun, and an online subscriber to my hometown Kansas City Star, I was overcome with sadness as I looked through your special section "A Future Without the Front Page."
My assumption had been that it was all about the internet taking away readers. But no, that's not the whole story. That old bugaboo shows its face once again: corporate greed. Conglomerates are draining every last thing of worth from local newspapers and leaving them to die. Capitalism run amok.
It's an old story. It's a plague upon this nation.

To the Editor:
My biggest fear with the demise of local newspapers is something that you touch on: corruption. Without local investigative reporting, local politicians and municipalities will have a field day without having to look over their shoulders to see if someone is watching. Online publications have neither the manpower nor the financial muscle to go after the bad guys.

Williams Selyem, king of Sonoma County pinot noir winemakers, sticks to its business roots

Texto completo: The worries among those operating a winery in 2019 are plentiful. The ongoing industry consolidation and possible recession are top concerns.
The management team at Williams Selyem in Healdsburg — the winery that put Sonoma County pinot noir on the map by winning the top prize for red wine at the 1987 California State Fair and decades later still is known for making some of the best pinot in the country — operates as an anomaly. Management’s chief task remains similar to the old adage of don’t try to fix something that’s not broken.
Owner John Dyson’s mantra in his 20-year ownership of Williams Selyem still stands: “I have never worked so hard to change nothing in my life.”
To be sure, there are challenges. Since the winery buys half of its grapes from contract growers, continuing to maintain sources for top-quality fruit is critical.
To spend a day at the Selyem winery on Westside Road is like visiting an earlier era before the 2004 movie “Sideways” launched pinot noir into what has become huge popularity in the U.S. marketplace. Its pinot mission is largely unchanged and the winery privately owned, while much bigger wineries and private-equity groups have acquired highly rated local pinot producers in their quest for growth.
For example, Jackson Family Wines of Santa Rosa bought Siduri Wines and Copain Wines. Kosta Browne Winery of Sebastopol is run by its second private- equity owner. Merry Edwards sold her Sebastopol winery this year to French Champagne maker Louis Roederer Champagne House, and then she retired.
They do things differently at Williams Selyem, enjoying tremendous success over 40 years. The winery founded by Burt Williams and Ed Selyem out of a Forestville garage maintains a waiting list of nine months to a year to sign up for its wine club. And the less than 10% of 25,000 cases of wine produced each year sold to restaurants and wholesalers never gets discounted — a mostly unheard of practice today in the wine sector.
Owners Dyson and his wife, Kathe, bought the winery in 1998 from the namesake founders for $9.5 million. They’ve adhered to the original business philosophy of making the best wine possible, not as much money as possible.
“The one thing that has been consistent the whole time is whatever it takes to make the best wine, we will spend the money,” said Eric Grams, the chief financial officer who has worked at the Selyem winery for 18 years. “The winemaker is ahead of the CFO in this business.”
A New York Ivy League educated private-equity investor who also owns wineries in Tuscany and New York, John Dyson’s career includes stints in local and state politics. He was a deputy mayor of New York in 1994-1996 as a Democrat under Republican Rudolph Giuliani. During the 1970s, the graduate of Cornell University and Princeton University was state commerce commissioner when the “I Love New York” tourism campaign was launched.
After the New York Dysons bought the Selyem winery in Sonoma County, there were fears that its proud pinot tradition was in danger. In fact, legendary New York Times reporter R.W. Apple Jr. sounded an alarm in a 1999 article when he wrote: “Can a minuscule winery, started by a couple of ornery, rough-hewn rural Californians, find continuing happiness as part of an international combine owned by a big-time venture capitalist from Wall Street?”
Those fears never were realized as the old-world winemaking techniques pioneered by Williams and Selyem were carried on by successor Bob Cabral, and now are handled by vice president of winemaking, Jeff Mangahas, who has been in charge since 2015. Most notably, the grapes are fermented in repurposed open-top dairy tanks with foot treading on the fruit. Punch downs in the tank — to break up the solids that rise to the surface — are done every six hours. Mangahas has the assistance of 15 interns this harvest season for such intensive work.
“It’s the perfect ratio of skin to juice,” said Mangahas, who was a research biologist studying cancer before he went into a career of making wine. “You are getting the best out of the grapes in a relatively short period of time.”
The wine is still aged in barrels made by Francois Freres cooperage in France. The wood itself is aged for three years before use to ensure the wines will not have too much tannins or carry a toasty mouthfeel. “This is really respectful with the fruit, and I think that’s what Burt (Williams) was shooting for in the early days and its been a winning formula,” Mangahas said.
The barrels are pricey, he conceded. But Mangahas justifies the cost with the phrase “it makes better wine.”
The one area Dyson has moved aggressively has been in acquiring land along the Russian River basin. The land buys include the 1998 purchase of the Drake property in Guerneville — which in the past provided apples for Gerber baby foods — and the 2016 deal that resulted in the 33-acre Saitone Vineyard located on Olivet Road, with its 100-year-old zinfandel vines.
Dyson said it took about 2.5 years of negotiating with the Saitone Family to agree on a deal. The sticking point was not about the price, but more on the legacy by keeping the old zinfandel vines and putting the name Saitone on the wine label. “They wanted to be sure to carry on the family tradition,” he said.
Even though it is known as a “cult pinot,” Williams Selyem has worked to keep prices reasonable compared to its rivals. Its average bottle price is $65. It offers some at $39 on the low end, and up to $110 on the high end. The bottle prices increase less than 2% annually and those spikes are only on some of the selections, rather than the whole product line, said Mark Malpiede, vice president of sales and marketing.
“If you can sell a pinot noir for $250 — great. And there are people who do that. They are not at our quality. They just figure that someone is going to buy it. And that’s fine. But that’s not how we work,” Malpiede said.
In fact, Williams Selyem has taken the extraordinary step in this era of winery surcharges of not charging wine club members when they visit the winery located on a 30-acre estate, a modern structure of stone, redwood and glass that is shaped at the top to resemble a wine barrel.
“At a minimum, they’re spending hundreds of dollars with us. And we are going to nickel and dime them for a tasting?” Malpiede said. Visitors also can sample some of the more limited bottlings, which have ranged from sparkling wine to grüner veltliner. About 80% of its production is pinot noir.
The building, constructed in 2010, is a 33,000-square-foot winery that also serves as the hospitality center. In the years since, the structure has become one of the wine sector’s most distinctive buildings in the North Coast. “John (Dyson) calls this his temple of pinot,” Mangahas said.
But most people have not seen it. The building is not visible from Westside Road and Williams Selyem discourages visitors. There is no sign out front noting the winery along the road. Daring visitors have to rely on a street address to ensure they are at the right place.
After more than 20 years, Dyson said he is still bullish on Sonoma County pinot noir and he thinks that there is sufficient land for more planting of vineyards. In the past, Dyson has been outspoken against attempts to curb or limit agricultural opportunities in the county.
“That’s the main advantage Sonoma has. … There is still land to be had,” he said in a recent interview.
Some Sonoma County wine companies such as Jackson and Foley Family Wines have ventured to Oregon for pinot noir vineyards. They have been lured by less expensive land prices as well as looser regulations. But Dyson has refused. “The problem is the (Oregon) wine is not as good,” he said.
The 76-year-old Dyson acknowledged he soon will have to think about succession. He hopes to have at least another five years to operate Williams Selyem before making a decision. A handoff to his children is uncertain because his two daughters have chosen other careers, though his granddaughter could be a possibility since she is, as he put it, a “wiz in biology.”
“The future of Sonoma County is certainly pinot noir. We are going to be in 10 years an equal destination to Napa,” Dyson said. “Napa is focusing more on cab.”

Trump's thought stream is often toxic sludge. Don't let him dominate national life.

Texto completo: Here in Connecticut, one of our U. S. senators has stopped following Donald Trump on the president’s favorite social media platform. “I’m unfollowing the President of the United States today on Twitter,” Chris Murphy announced, “because his feed is the most hate-filled, racist, and demeaning of the 200+ I follow, and it regularly ruins my day. ”
If only more people in the news business and on social media would follow Murphy’s example, in spirit if not literally. We really ought to stop allowing Trump’s toxicity to dominate and inflame the national conversation — and stop inadvertently spreading it.
Whether he’s venting on Twitter, on stage or in regular news media, whether he’s slapping derogatory nicknames on political rivals like “Sleepy” Joe Biden or media figures like “Fredo” Chris Cuomo, whether his rants are racist or just plain mean and untruthful, Trump’s thought stream is often a toxic sludge. It can bring out the worst in people — the very worst, as witnessed by the Trumpian echoes heard in the manifesto of the mass murderer in El Paso, Texas.
We must stop amplifying Trump
A recent Washington Post op-ed headline declared, “We must confront Trump’s racism every time — no matter how often he spews it. ” It’s true that calling out racism is crucial in stopping it from becoming normalized, and that Trump’s rhetoric has real-world consequences. But we must accept some important realities.
Such as the fact that the sheer volume of gunk oozing out of the White House makes it nearly impossible — and quite unhealthy — to respond to each instance. Not to mention unhelpful. Once a pattern or truth is established, is it really necessary to seize on each example of it? When you already have 1,000 case studies, is there any great value in the 1,001st? Better to reserve the alarm bells for offenses that break new ground and pose the greatest danger.
Trump's base: Trump won't stop his racially charged rhetoric. Repetition is what makes it work.
What journalists and social-media sharers do to expose something, over and over and over, can cause their audiences to become desensitized to it. And it can have the unintended effect of propagating the foul stuff we are ostensibly trying to contain.
As Syracuse University communications professor Whitney Phillips argues, calling something out does more than rally people against it. When Trump opponents identify and condemn hate-filled and inflammatory invective from his or is fans, we also give it legs. Some of the people we reach will not join us in our hand-wringing and face-palming. They’ll celebrate the ugliness and, possibly, act on it.
'Hurts or helps Trump' is wrong frame
Journalists have long argued that shining a light on rot can serve as a disinfectant. Valid point. But as Phillips points out, light also makes things grow. By paying attention to trolls and extremists and circulating their venom, even in the act of condemning them, we play into their hands. “At a certain point you have to realize that you’re promoting them,” one anonymous journalist said in an interview with Phillips for a study she published titled “The Oxygen of Amplification. ”
Focusing too much on the problematic president, and in the wrong way, clouds our judgment and distorts our vision. Must news coverage be framed in terms of how a given event might help or hurt Trump’s reelection prospects or activate his already activated base?
Case in point: A recent New York Times headline announced, "U. S. economy slows, denying Trump 3% talking point. " Strange that Trump's precious talking point is the most important consequence of a slowing economy — not the jobs lost and lives and communities affected.
In the run-up to the 2012 election, I joked with friends that the media were so fixated on President Barack Obama's reelection chances that if there were news of an impending meteor strike, one certain to wipe out the human race, the headlines would say, "Human extinction dampens Obama election prospects. "
Such election mania seems even worse now, and the vote is still 15 months away.
Ration your bandwidth carefully
Trump opponents need to beware of the temptation to hope for bad news because it will hurt him politically. Will they cheer if manufacturing plants close in Trump country? Or if the “patriotic” farmers absorb even more economic hardship and destructive weather because of Trump’s tariffs and the climate chaos he refuses to face?
Despite some of the media treatments of the subject, Trump's inflammatory words and actions matter not primarily in terms of how they help or hurt him with his base (and swing voters in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania). They matter because of the damage they do to human dignity and our democratic system. Because of the influence they can have on his devotees’ behavior. And because they are wrong.
Republican activist who ran for Congress: Trump stole my party, and my heart is breaking.
I was one of those who argued before the 2018 midterms that the consequences of the election were enormous, and that all fair-minded and democracy-loving people were compelled to vote regardless of how excited they were about the names on the ballot. I will no doubt say the same in the fall of 2020.
In the meantime, let’s save some attention for important things happening beyond what Trump is spewing on a given day — including a lot that the president would rather have us ignore. Our gun violence epidemic, for instance, and the failure of the Trump-owned Republican Party to respond. The fact that July was the hottest month on record. Ever.
It’s a big world out there and a dicey time to be in it. Ration your bandwidth and influence wisely.

Texto completo: It wasn't quite Dewey Defeats Truman but presumptions (including by me) that the next Queens district attorney would be public defender Tiffany Cabán have been proven wrong. Melinda Katz is definitively the Democratic nominee, tantamount to election in Queens.
That being the case, it is worth setting down some suggestions, respectfully, for her first 100 days in office.
Katz was criticized during the election because she has no courtroom experience, let alone prior experience as an assistant prosecutor. Indeed, her background is not ideal. But unlike Cabán, she has extensive executive and public policy experience, having served both as borough president and a legislator. And perhaps more importantly, she does not seem to share some of Cabán's more radical predilections, such as both supporting the closing of Rikers Island and opposing a new community detention center in Queens.
So, here are some suggestions for the presumptive DA:
Hire a career prosecutor as the chief assistant DA. Even the New York Times, in surprisingly endorsing Cabán, said she would "need to surround herself with seasoned prosecutors." That is good advice for Katz as well, and it should start at her right hand, with the professional whose job it will be to act in her stead when she is unavailable, and whom she can trust to guide her decisions as issues arise that are new to her. New York is full of excellent career prosecutors, many of whom are committed to reasonable change in the direction Katz's voters hope for.
Identify the steady hands in the office; you'll need them. Thankfully gone are the days when new DAs purged the staff and brought in lawyers from the clubhouse. So we can expect the vast majority of Katz's staff to remain. Among them are ADAs who can be counted on to keep the ship moving forward in tricky areas like domestic violence, sex crimes, and homicide, so that Katz can understand the office works while planning her changes. She should find and rely on them-the last thing she wants is a disaster or scandal as she is getting revved up.
Remember that the DA is not just a politician but also a minister of justice. As elected officials, DAs of course represent their constituents, but they have the additional duty to see that justice is done, no matter the wishes of the press or the electorate. That means taking on unpopular cases, and, importantly, it means not pursuing certain cases even when the public is clamoring for heads to roll.
Don't let politics anywhere near individual cases. A related issue, which all elected DAs face, is what to do about the politicians, community leaders, donors, and other supporters whom Katz has been courting for years. History reveals that some who have granted her favors will want to weigh in on particular cases. Resist that temptation: Only involved parties should get an audience with the DA's office.
Use asset forfeiture money to prevent crime. Because of its participation in a federal task force, the office is sitting on many tens of millions in asset forfeiture money from bank settlements. Follow the lead of the Manhattan DA and use that money to prevent crime. Manhattan has used the money, among other things, to clear rape kit backlogs, support sports programs, and prevent cyberattacks.
Don't forget white-collar crime and organized crime. Almost completely missing from the race was the battle against fraud, corruption, and organized crime, absent platitudes like Cabán's pledge to "go after" landlords. But this is a serious area, and Queens is a serious office; Katz would do well to redouble its extensive existing focus.
All in all, Katz seems to be a mature, reasonable politician who, while committed to progressive change, isn't about to blow up the system. Careful thought and a steady hand should help her succeed in a tough job.

Texto completo: By the time they got to Woodstock, they were half a million strong, but my wife of seven months, Betty, and I were not among the gathering at Bethel, New York, as we had planned.
I remember reading an ad for the Aug. 15-17, 1969, event that spring in the New York Times - of all places - and saying, “Hey, honey, they’re having a concert in upstate New York in August. It’s not far from the Baseball Hall of Fame, so let’s go.”
Plans were made, family was informed and the Tuesday before the event we headed north on Interstate 81, making it almost to the New York/Pennsylvania border when the car blew a soft plug. We got towed back to Lansford, reorganized and decided to use our other car to spend the weekend in New York City visiting restaurants, clubs and taking in the four-game series at Yankee Stadium between the Yankees and Detroit Tigers.
Somehow, we forgot to tell our parents about our change of plans and shock began to set in for them when the NBC Nightly News brought Woodstock into their living rooms. Betty’s mom was in a state of shock, her dad didn’t have much to say, my mom wasn’t sure what to think and dad just rolled with it.
We got home Sunday night, but didn’t get around to calling home until Monday afternoon. Let’s just say the conversations were memorable.
Since then, Betty and I have seen 19 acts that performed at Woodstock, the latest being Santana two years ago at MusikFest in Bethlehem. Of all the groups, we agree none capture the spirit of Woodstock better than Canned Heat, and we really wish we had been goin’ up the country.

TRUMP, NOT CHINA, HAS THE UPPER HAND IN HONG KONG

Texto completo: President Donald Trump has warned China that it must respond "humanely" to the protests in Hong Kong if it wants a trade deal, for the first time suggesting that the United States would impose costs on Beijing if it launched a Tiananmen Square-style crackdown on the city. It's about time.
China is in a much weaker position in Hong Kong than many realize. It claims to be showing "restraint," but the fact is if China could easily crush the protesters, at a cost acceptable to Beijing, it would have done so by now.
The situation China faces in Hong Kong is very different from the one in Tiananmen Square three decades ago. At Tiananmen, the protesters were gathered in a large public square like sitting ducks where they could be easily mowed down. In Hong Kong, protest tactics have been adopted specifically to avoid another Tiananmen.
The protesters are "like water" flowing through a huge and crowded city. Demonstrations are organized on the fly, via social media, and take place in multiple locations simultaneously. If China cracks down in one place, the protesters can disperse and start again in a different location. Moreover, the Hong Kong protests are leaderless, which means there is no cadre of organizers who can be rounded up to break up the movement. If China arrests one group of leaders, others will simply rise up to take their places.
In Tiananmen, the clearing operation was conducted in the dark of night and out of sight of the media. A Hong Kong intervention would take place in the full glare of the international press corps and under the scrutiny of millions of cellphone cameras that would record every atrocity for the world to see. And the operation could last for months or even years.
In Hong Kong, the terrain favors the defenders. If the military moved in, it would face determined resistance. China wants to break popular support for the protests, but a crackdown would have the opposite effect. Think about the trouble the United States had rooting insurgents out in Iraqi cities; how much harder would it be in a modern city such as Hong Kong?
The one advantage China now enjoys compared with 30 years ago is technology. On the mainland, the regime is constructing an Orwellian surveillance state, with cameras and facial-recognition technology to track its citizens. The extent to which Beijing has wired Hong Kong is unknown, but protesters can still use technology to their advantage, communicating via encrypted messaging apps and social media. Shutting down their means of communication would also cripple Hong Kong's financial sector, which depends on the free flow of information.
Finally, a military intervention would mean the end of Hong Kong, and that is something Beijing cannot afford. The mainland economy is slowing and might even be contracting. Mr. Trump is hammering China with tariffs. If President Xi Jinping cracks down, he will cause capital and talent to flee the city, which could kill the golden goose.
So, what should Mr. Trump do? He should warn Mr. Xi that if he launches a crackdown in Hong Kong, then the United States will repeal the Hong Kong Policy Act, under which we treat Hong Kong separately from China and give it better terms. That treatment rests on the idea that Hong Kong is a distinct entity, but if Beijing moves in and occupies the city, ending its autonomy under the "one country, two systems" principle, then the rationale for treating Hong Kong better disappears. (It's worth noting that nearly 1,400 U.S. businesses operate in Hong Kong.)
Mr. Trump should also tell Mr. Xi that if he cracks down, the United States will welcome Hongkongers as refugees. Hong Kong is the most economically vibrant city on Earth, filled with hardworking, creative, entrepreneurial people - precisely the kind Mr. Trump has said he wants coming into our country. If China does not want them, Mr. Trump should say we'll happily take all their entrepreneurial energy and creativity here in America.
Mr. Trump should make clear that the cost of military intervention will be capital flight, brain drain and the end of Hong Kong's preferential trade status, as well as any hopes of a trade deal. China would face massive tariffs and international sanctions that could send its economy into full contraction - which could cause instability and protests on the mainland. A military operation, even if it succeeded, would be Pyrrhic victory.
China does not have the upper hand in this standoff; Mr. Trump does. He should use his leverage to save Hong Kong.

Texto completo: Sometimes the self-declared greatest counterpuncher in the world lands a blow on the wrong person.
That was the case on Thursday night in Manchester, N.H., during a campaign rally when President Trump publicly ridiculed a man because of his weight; the president thought he was a protester. Instead, the man turned out to be a supporter of the president's who was trying to help remove the actual protesters.
The episode took place midway through the rally, as Mr. Trump's 90-minute speech was interrupted and the president paused to wait for the disruption to end. He looked up to the seats where it was taking place, and to a man wearing a Trump 2020 campaign shirt, and said, "That guy's got a serious weight problem! Go home. Start exercising." Mr. Trump then turned back to his speech and said his campaign was about "love."
The president has come to be known for elementary insults about people's appearances. But it is rare for him to go after supporters, whom Mr. Trump regularly flatters and praises in public.
The man with the "serious weight problem," Frank Dawson, was standing in the arena near some protesters who were being ushered out. Mr. Dawson, donning his Trump gear, was fist-pumping the air as they were guided away.
Mr. Trump's aides quickly realized the problem and tracked down Mr. Dawson's contact information so the president could call him. From Air Force One, Mr. Trump left a voice mail message for Mr. Dawson, but did not apologize for his insult, an aide said, and instead said he did not mean to refer to him. The president then thanked Mr. Dawson for his support.
But Mr. Dawson said he was not upset by the insult.
"I think he thought I was part of it, but I wasn't," Mr. Dawson said on Fox News, later adding: "Everything's good. I love the guy. He's the best thing that ever happened to this country."
Before he knew he criticized a supporter, Mr. Trump, in a moment of self-deprecation, acknowledged his own struggles with weight and then said the man at the rally had "a bigger problem than I do."
Mr. Trump has used weight as a way to demean women and business associates. After Hillary Clinton mentioned in a 2016 presidential debate that Mr. Trump once referred to a Miss Universe participant as "Miss Piggy," he called that contestant, Alicia Machado, the "worst" he had ever had because of what he called a "massive" weight gain. Also, he once kept in an office drawer a "fat photo" of an employee, and told a colleague, "You like your candy," according to The Washington Post.
The president also has a long history of lobbing insults at protesters and belittling his real and perceived opponents for their appearances.
While he was campaigning in 2015, Mr. Trump mocked the appearance of a New York Times reporter with a physical disability. "Now the poor guy, you ought to see this guy," Mr. Trump said, before jerking his arms around and holding his right hand at an angle. He later denied that he was mocking the reporter's appearance.
And at a rally that year in Massachusetts, Mr. Trump said: "You know, it's amazing. I mentioned food stamps, and that guy who was seriously overweight went crazy," referring to a protester who had been removed for calling Mr. Trump a "cancer that is killing democracy."
In 2016, Mr. Trump retweeted an unflattering image of the wife of Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, then his opponent in the Republican presidential primary race. A picture of Mr. Cruz's wife, Heidi, was featured next to a flattering picture of Mr. Trump's wife, Melania, a former model. The caption on the picture said, "Images are worth a thousand words."
That same year, Mr. Trump mocked the appearance of Carly Fiorina, also a rival for the Republican nomination, suggesting that she was not attractive enough to be the next president of the United States.
"Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?" Mr. Trump said during an interview with Rolling Stone magazine. "I mean, she's a woman, and I'm not supposed to say bad things, but really, folks, come on. Are we serious?"
He later said that he was not referring to Ms. Fiorina's face, but rather her "persona."

Texto completo: Old Town Road is a real place. You could probably take a horse there, if you wanted to - except that these days, it might be a little harder to find.
A quiet residential street in Wellesley, Massachusetts, was called Old Town Road long before the country-trap song by Lil Nas X became a sensation. "Old Town Road" is not only popular - it's record-shattering. The song has become the longest-running No. 1 single in the 61-year history of Billboard's Hot 100 chart.
And in Wellesley this spring, around the time the song took off, the street signs at either end of Old Town Road started being ripped away.
That's misdemeanor larceny, and it's not easy to do. Each sign was on a pole about 12 feet tall and bolted into an underground anchor. The metal poles appeared to have been either unbolted or felled using a hacksaw.
"Somebody's got to be very determined to steal this sign," Stephanie Hawkinson, a spokeswoman for the town, said in an interview Monday.
After each of the signs was stolen three times - for a total of six contraband "Old Town Rd." signs whose whereabouts remain unknown - the city stopped replacing them. It's expensive; each new pair of signs costs $250 or more, and that's not including labor.
Hawkinson said that street signs had been stolen in Wellesley from time to time, and more often in the summer. But the Old Town Road thieves have been especially persistent.
"This one sort of caught us by surprise," she said.
Wellesley's is not the only Old Town Road in the United States. There are many, from New York to Texas to Louisiana. There is even one in Villa Rica, Georgia, not far from where Lil Nas X grew up. (The mayor of Villa Rica said he had no knowledge of the street signs being stolen there.)
A representative for Lil Nas X did not respond to a request for comment about the vandals in Massachusetts.
Hawkinson pointed out that the thefts presented a public safety problem, because street signs can help emergency responders navigate the town.
She added that Wellesley gets its street signs from Atlantic Broom Service, a company based in Brockton, Massachusetts, that makes road maintenance products, and that people could order an Old Town Road sign from the company rather than steal from the municipality. It's not free, but at least it doesn't involve a hacksaw.
Dalia Whelton, the sign shop manager at Atlantic Broom Service, agreed. "Just come and buy it from us!" she said. "That poor town."
She said people could order a personalized street sign from the company for about $85, plus shipping.
"They should think twice," Whelton said of the thieves. "The reason street signs are there is for the emergency responders to get to the right place."
Hawkinson said Wellesley would wait for the song's popularity to wane. She acknowledged that it could be a while.
"We're keeping an eye on the popularity of the song, which continues to be at No. 1," she said. "So we're holding off as long as we can, to make sure that we don't have to replace them again."

Texto completo: After presenting a staged reading in 2018, The Western Stage has obtained the rights to fully produce Ira Bilowit's musical adaptation of John Steinbeck's "Of Mice and Men," a work that has not been seen onstage since its brief run off-Broadway in 1958, and one which held the Nobel Laureate's earnest approval throughout its creation. Despite its all-star cast, an untimely newspaper strike forced the show to close before it gained recognition. The National Steinbeck Center acquired the original script and score after Bilowit's death in 2016 and has graciously made these materials available for The Western Stage to bring the work back to life after 61 years. What's more, opening weekend will culminate in an exclusive panel discussion, featuring a collection of the big names responsible for making the 2019 revival a reality.
Steinbeck wrote "Of Mice and Men" with the intention of it being presented on the stage. He drew on his experiences being brought up in the "Salad Bowl of America," where during his teens he worked several summers at a Spreckels Sugar beet farm. That hands-on experience introduced him to the hardships experienced by his fellow farm hands, migrants who had to constantly move to follow the work. Steinbeck witnessed the struggles of workers desperate to achieve some measure of material prosperity but ultimately failing due to circumstances beyond their control. Like many of Steinbeck's works, "Of Mice and Men" is a cutting portrait of the migrant worker's struggles as both heroic and tragic.
The well-known dramatic stage production opened on Broadway in 1937 at the Music Box Theatre and ran for 207 performances. However, Steinbeck never attended a single performance of this Broadway production. The reason, as Steinbeck told director George S. Kaufman, was that the play was "perfect" as it existed in his own mind, and anything presented on stage would surely be a disappointment. Not until the creation of the musical would Steinbeck find satisfaction in the treatment of his work.
An arts journalist and lifelong New Yorker named Ira Bilowit (1926-2016) created the piece that captured Steinbeck's approval. During Bilowit's lengthy career in arts journalism, he worked as a theater critic, feature writer and editor. Over a half-century, he interviewed many of the leading performing arts practitioners in almost every media, from Tennessee Williams to Milton Berle. Bilowit became inspired after attending an "Evening of Steinbeck," during which two actors brought him to tears with the last scene from "Of Mice and Men." He was reminded that Steinbeck's classic was one of his favorite books. He had also recently seen a production of "The Threepenny Opera" and felt that there was a strong corollary between Steinbeck's writings and the genre of folk opera.
Bilowit bought the rights for a six-month window to adapt and write lyrics for "Of Mice and Men" along with a composer. The creative team was in constant communication with Steinbeck during the adaptation process. The author wrote letters full of suggestions, while at the same time telling them he didn't want to interfere.
The musical premiered at the venerable Provincetown Playhouse in 1958, as part of the then-new Off-Broadway movement. The production boasted an all-star cast, featuring Art Lund, Joanne Sullivan and Leo Penn (father of actor Sean Penn, who coincidentally is a recipient of the John Steinbeck Award). The New York Times called it "a work of substance and power." The day after the musical opened, a newspaper strike hit New York, and all the city's newspapers were closed. A few reviews managed to seep through, but it wasn't enough to gain recognition and build an audience. The musical closed after just six weeks and was never seen onstage again.
After Bilowit's death, the National Steinbeck Center acquired the materials from his work on the musical. The collection is a treasure trove of original scripts, hand-written scores, photos, publicity clippings and correspondences between Bilowit and Steinbeck. With permission from the Bilowit Estate, the Steinbeck Estate, and the help of the National Steinbeck Center, The Western Stage was able to do a live staged reading of the work in May 2018, which played to an audience of 500 that included Waverly Kaffaga, executor of the Steinbeck Estate, who was so pleased with the reading that she authorized the rights for The Western Stage to produce the show as part of their 2019 season.
TWS Artistic Director Jon Selover will direct the production, which holds a personal significance for him: "Of Mice and Men" was a part of his very first season with The Western Stage in 1984. "To direct a production that was close to Steinbeck's heart, to bring it back after 60 years, and to do it here in Salinas is really quite special," Selover says.
The Western Stage's opening weekend of "Of Mice and Men" a Musical Drama will culminate in an exclusive one-night-only discussion panel with world famous Steinbeck experts, including Anthony Newfield (New York Actor/Director and personal friend of Bilowit, credited with bringing the archived materials to the National Steinbeck Center), Alice Spivak (Bilowit's wife during the creation of the musical), Susan Shillinglaw (world-renowned Steinbeck scholar and San Jose State University professor), Jon Selover (TWS Artistic Director and Director of TWS' "Of Mice and Men" reading and revival) and Waverly Kaffaga (executor of the Steinbeck Estate). The panel will discuss Steinbeck's process in writing the novel, the creation of the musical, the musical's evolution from 1958 Off-Broadway premier to 2018 reading and the 2019 revival production. This event is exclusively for ticket holders attending the Sunday matinee on Aug. 25 and will take place directly following the performance. This is in addition to the regularly scheduled ReActions for "Of Mice and Men" on Sept. 8, open to the general public.

Obama reportedly told Biden 'you don't have to' run for president

Texto completo: Former President Barack Obama reportedly told his former Vice President Joe Biden that he didn't "have to" run for president in 2020.
“You don’t have to do this, Joe, you really don’t,” Obama told Biden earlier this year, according to The New York Times.
Their report goes on to say that Obama quietly tried to convince his vice president to sit out of the 2016 presidential race, arguing that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had a better chance to build upon his eight years as president. He was also worried about Biden's state of mind following the death of his son, Beau.
In response to Obama telling him he didn't have to run, Biden, who believes he would've beaten President Trump in 2016, said that he wouldn't be able to live with himself if he didn't take this opportunity the second time around.
Since then though, Obama has quietly chided Biden, saying that his advisers and inner circle are "too old and out of touch with the current political climate," The Times' report added.
Obama met with two of Biden's advisers in March and told them regardless of the outcome of the election, the most important thing was that Biden doesn't “embarrass himself” or “damage his legacy."

Texto completo: El magnate Jeffrey Epstein acabó con su vida ahorcándese en la celda del Centro Corrección Metropolitano de Manhattan (Nueva York) . La oficina forense de la ciudad hizo público este viernes el análisis que deriva de la autopsia.
La muerte del multimillonario de 66 años había cuestionado cómo un preso acusado de abuso de menores y tráfico sexual pudo escapar de una cárcel para delincuentes de alto perfil . Las teorías de la conspiración rececorrieron las redes sociales y los platós de televisión de algunas cadenas conservadoras. Hasta el propio Donald Trump compartió la acusación infundada que responsabilizaba a Bill Clinton de la muerte del magnate, amigo de ambos presidentes.
La Oficina de prisiones comunicó en el momento de la muerte que la causa había sido un “aparente suicidio”, pero eso no acalló planteamientos más o menos inverosímiles . Más aún cuando la autopsia no se reveló el domingo, tal y como se había anunciado.
A lo largo de esta semana han crecido las críticas hacia la cárcel que hasta el capo de la droga Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán Loera tachó de “tortura” y donde el acusado no estaba bajo vigilancia constante por riesgo de suicidio, a pesar de haber intentado acabar con su vida dos semanas antes de su muerte. En su lugar, el régimen de supervición requería una visita de los oficiales cada media hora. Pero el cuando hallaron su cuerpo hacía tres horas que nadie pasaba por su celda y más tarde se reveló que uno de los dos agentes que lo supervisaba no tenía la formación necesaria .
Incluso el fiscal general de Estados Unidos, William Barr, denunció serias irregularidades en una cárcel federal que está bajo su propia supervisión. Un representante anónimo del personal de la cárcel también se quejó de las condiciones de trabajo del lugar ya que los trabajadores se ven obligados a trabajar turnos dobles y triples. Por otro lado, Epstein había estado varios días sin compañero de celda, pese a las exigencias federales.
Ya este jueves The Washington Post y The New York Times adelantaron que la autopsia había hallado varios huesos rotos en el cuello del preso. Ese anuncio volvió a avivar las especulaciones de homicidio por estrangulamiento . La forense principal de la ciudad de Nueva York, Barbara Sampson, dijo entonces que ningún factor aislado de una autopsia puede proporcionar una respuesta concluyente.
Epstein estaba acusado de crear una red de tráfico sexual de menores hace una década en sus mansiones de Nueva York y Florida, y se había declarado inocente de los cargos. El millonario ya había afrontado acusaciones similares en Florida en 2008, aunque entonces llegó a un acuerdo con el fiscal Alexander Acosta, posteriormente secretario de Trabajo en la Administración de Trump, que tuvo que renunciar a este cargo por el escándalo desatado por un pacto secreto ocultado a las víctimas.

Bellbrook-Sugarcreek schools fight release of shooter’s records

Texto completo: The Bellbrook-Sugarcreek school district is fighting a lawsuit filed by multiple media outlets seeking the education records of Connor Betts, the Oregon District mass shooter, and the case is being fast-tracked for a quick resolution.
The Dayton Daily News and WHIO-TV, along with CNN, The New York Times and other news agencies, has sued the school district and Superintendent Doug Cozad, to compel the school district to release Betts’ records of when he was a student there prior to graduating in 2013.
Dayton Daily News, WHIO sue school district to get shooter’s records
Former classmates have said in interviews with reporters that Betts had created a hit list and a rape list of students, had other incidents of violence and threats, and that he was suspended at Bellbrook High School for an extended period of time.
“This community and the country at large deserve to know why this tragedy happened, what might have led to it, and what may be done to prevent future tragedies,” the complaint reads as filed by the Dayton Daily News and WHIO-TV’s attorney Erin E. Rhinehart.
The question for the second appellate court in Greene County to decide, as stated in the school’s attorney Tabitha Justice’s response to the complaint — “Do the federal and state statutes that protect student records expire upon the death of the student?”
Justice contends in her response there’s “no legal authority for the proposition that those statutory protections expire upon the death of the student.”
“Respondents reasonably believed that the deinal of confidential educational records during a mass media feeding frenzy would serve the public policy reasons underlying the laws making educational records confidential,” Justice’s answer reads.
Presiding over the case are Judges Jeffrey M. Welbaum, Mary E. Donovan and Michael L. Tucker.
The judges granted the motion for the case to be expedited, which condenses the typical schedule to move the case along to resolution faster.
The judges will have to decide whether oral arguments are needed. The case schedule indicates the last required filing before the potential necessity for oral arguments is Sept. 5.
WBNS-TV in Columbus has subsequently filed a separate lawsuit seeking the same release of records.

Texto completo: A year ago today, more than 200 newspapers across the U.S. ran editorials decrying President Donald Trump’s repeated application of the term "enemies of the people" to describe the press and reinforcing the need for a vibrant free press in a healthy democracy. There is still cause for concern.
Since that show of solidarity, the U.S. has fallen three places in Reporters Without Borders’ World Press Freedom Index ranking. We’re now 48th out of 180 countries surveyed.
Data compiled by the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker points to an escalation in violence: By April, there had been 10 reported attacks on journalists this year alone and 46 since 2017, including a reporter in California who was struck in the face and had her phone stolen as she interviewed voters.
It’s not just the U.S. In some places, threats against journalists are now "occupational hazards" — in Brazil, supporters of President Jair Bolsonaro have attacked members of the media both online and physically.
And President Trump continues to attack the media, revisiting the "enemy of the people" slogan in June when he accused The New York Times of a "virtual act of treason." Such attacks, whether from the president or any person in power, must be resisted.
The press is not perfect, to be sure. But to vilify the entire institution because of its imperfections poses a very real danger to America’s freedom.
In one of our first editorials on the topic in December 2016, we weren’t necessarily thinking of physical harm when we warned that the assault on the press is dangerous. We wrote: "It undermines our democracy.
"It allows those in power to say, ‘Ignore the facts no matter what the facts may be.’ "It allows partisans of both parties to say, ‘Believe in my distortions because you agree with my ideology.’ Or, ‘because you agree with my cult personality.’ "It allows anyone who screws up to say, ‘The problem’s not me; the problem’s the messenger.’ " The "enemy of the people" refrain can provide a useful political rhetorical slogan. But repeating such a slogan, a practice common among history’s strongmen, and infusing it with a tone of legitimacy is not a harmless political device.
Writer Richard Frankel described the impact in a June 9 article for Salon: "After all," he wrote, "enemies are not debated. Enemies are not reasoned with. One doesn’t compromise with an enemy. An enemy is confronted, is combated, is neutralized, and ultimately, an enemy is destroyed. The point at which politics shifts from truth to lies, from opponents to enemies, is the point at which democracy dies."
That distinction, that warning, is as important to remember today as it was a year ago.
Facts matter. Support a Free Press.

Epstein's death is a systematic disgrace

Texto completo: As a physician who has worked with prisoners as well as suicidal patients, I was shocked by the strange circumstances surrounding sexual offender Jeffrey Epstein's death by apparent hanging in his cell. We may never know for sure all the details of what happened, though I expect further review of the autopsy results to determine once and for all whether this death was self-inflicted.
Earlier in my career, I worked on both a psychiatric ward and a prison ward. In both places, the regular surveillance was sufficient (at least every 15 minutes on the psych ward) so that suicide was almost impossible. For someone who, like Epstein, had apparently made a suicide attempt less than three weeks before, it is almost inconceivable to me that he could possibly be without diligent, frequent observation and without surveillance cameras constantly monitoring him.
How could he be placed in a cell, according to the New York Post's unnamed source, with a bunk bed to hang himself on and a strong enough bed sheet to do it with? If one cellmate was transferred, as sources told The New York Times, why wasn't he immediately replaced with another?
'Serious irregularities' raise eyebrows It's true that suicide is the leading cause of death in jails and, in 2014, hit a 15-year high in federal and state prisons, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. But although accused sexual offenders are particularly at risk for both suicides and homicides, the Metropolitan Correctional Center where Epstein was imprisoned has had only one reported suicide over the past 40 years, the gangster Louis Turra, 21 years ago.
Despite its reputation for squalor and overcrowding, the corrections center is not known for suicide.
What is most disturbing to me, as a physician, is the way Epstein went from being on suicide watch starting July 23 to going for long periods without being observed just six days later, sources told The Times. Having treated depression for many years, I know suicidal ideation doesn't turn on and off like a switch. A person does not want to end it all one day — staring down news as bleak as Epstein faced — and then six days later you are suddenly stable and out of danger. Whoever took Epstein off this watch made a very poor judgement at the very least.
I am not a conspiracy theorist, though it is conceivable to me that the "serious irregularities" Attorney General William Barr is concerned about could possibly turn out to reveal that Epstein's was not a simple suicide, that there were other actors in this tragedy. Time, along with the final autopsy report, will tell.
Doctors try to save everyone But no matter what happened inside Epstein's cell, both the medical personnel and the prison authorities who were involved had the obligation to bring him to a safer place, whether that meant more enhanced psychiatric observation inside the prison, or transferring him with enhanced security to an inpatient psychiatric facility.
After all, we don't judge our patients, no matter how repulsive their actions or the allegations against them are. Doctors and nurses are simply assigned to try to keep them alive. I have taken care of a perpetrator of assault chained to a stretcher in the emergency room right next to his victim suffering from a gunshot wound, and I have had to do my best to save both without hesitation.
The prison officials who took Jeffrey Epstein off his suicide watch prematurely, relegating him to almost certain death, did not do the prison system and how it handles mental health emergencies any favors.

Texto completo: Our guide to plays and musicals coming to New York stages and a few last-chance picks of shows that are about to close. Our reviews of open shows are at nytimes.com/reviews/theater.
Broadway
'BEAUTIFUL: THE CAROLE KING MUSICAL' at the Stephen Sondheim Theater (ongoing). This 2014 bio-musical, which Ben Brantley described as "friendly" and "formulaic," recently announced that it would close on Oct. 27. So if you want to feel the earth move under your feet, now might be a good time to see the play. This summer, the singer-songwriter Vanessa Carlton stepped into the sensibly shod role of Carole King, the part that won Jessie Mueller a Tony.

[Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.]
Last Chance
'THE CHER SHOW' at the Neil Simon Theater (closes on Aug. 18). Do you believe in life after Broadway? This jukebox bio-musical, which needed three actresses -- Micaela Diamond, Teal Wicks and Stephanie J. Block -- to play one pop diva, closes its sequined doors. While Jesse Green praised Bob Mackie's extravagant costumes, the musical, he noted, is "all gesture, no craft: dramatically threadbare and surprisingly unrevealing."
877-250-2929, thechershowbroadway.com
'GET ON YOUR KNEES' at the Cherry Lane Theater (closes on Aug. 18). The curtain is about to fall on Jacqueline Novak's erudite history of fellatio (though it will reopen on Aug. 28 at the Lucille Lortel Theater). An author and a stand-up, Novak has a style that is brash, brainy and not as lewd as you might expect. Her show is less about the penis than it is about the indignity of being, as she says, "a woman that lusts after the common shaft."
866-811-4111, cherrylanetheatre.org
'KING KONG' at the Broadway Theater (closes on Aug. 18). An oversize ape is out of a job. This Broadway musical, notorious for its giant, intricate puppet, beats its chest for the final time. In a dual review, the New York Times chief theater critics evaluated a show that Ben Brantley described as "spirit-crushing," dismissing the score, the book and even the one-ton gorilla himself.
212-239-6200, kingkongbroadway.com
'PRETTY WOMAN: THE MUSICAL' at the Nederlander Theater (closes on Aug. 18). Having stopped a while and talked a while, this musical based on the popular film concludes its Broadway run. Ben Brantley wrote that the show, which is directed by Jerry Mitchell and features songs by Bryan Adams and Jim Vallance, "lowers the already ground-scraping bar for literal-minded adaptations of film to stage."
877-250-2929, prettywomanthemusical.com
'WHAT THE CONSTITUTION MEANS TO ME' at the Helen Hayes Theater (closes on Aug. 24). Heidi Schreck's harrowing, hilarious interrogation of her family's and our nation's history stages its final debates. Jesse Green described it as "a tragedy told as a comedy, a work of inspired protest, a slyly crafted piece of persuasion and a tangible contribution to the change it seeks." He added, "It is not just the best play to open on Broadway so far this season, but also the most important."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Breaking a long silence about a high-profile National Security Agency program that sifts records of Americans' telephone calls and text messages in search of terrorists, the Trump administration on Thursday acknowledged for the first time that the system has been indefinitely shut down -- but asked Congress to extend its legal basis anyway.
In a letter to Congress delivered on Thursday and obtained by The New York Times, the administration urged lawmakers to make permanent the legal authority for the National Security Agency to gain access to logs of Americans' domestic communications, the USA Freedom Act. The law, enacted after the intelligence contractor Edward J. Snowden revealed the existence of the program in 2013, is set to expire in December, but the Trump administration wants it made permanent.
The unclassified letter, signed on Wednesday by Dan Coats in one of his last acts as the director of National Intelligence, also conceded that the N.S.A. has indefinitely shut down that program after recurring technical difficulties repeatedly caused it to collect more records than it had legal authority to gather. That fact has previously been reported, but the administration had refused to officially confirm its status.
"The National Security Agency has suspended the call detail records program that uses this authority and deleted the call detail records acquired under this authority," Mr. Coats wrote. "This decision was made after balancing the program's relative intelligence value, associated costs, and compliance and data integrity concerns caused by the unique complexities of using these company-generated business records for intelligence purposes."
[ Read the letter Dan Coats sent to Congress.]
Complicating matters, three other surveillance authorities primarily used by the F.B.I. are also set to expire in mid-December. They include provisions that let investigators get court orders to collect business records relevant to a national security investigation, wiretap "lone wolf" terrorists without links to a foreign power, and keep wiretapping someone suspected of being a spy or a terrorist who switches phone lines in an effort to evade surveillance.
Mr. Coats's letter said the administration supported making those three provisions permanent as well, rather than merely subjecting them to another extension of several years, as Congress has previously done.
The executive branch had been internally divided over whether to push for an extension of the part of the Freedom Act that authorizes the phone records program. Months ago, the N.S.A. presented a bleak assessment of the program to the White House, saying it carried high costs and few benefits, but some officials argued that it made sense to keep the legal authority in case technical solutions emerged to make it work better, according to officials familiar with internal deliberations.
Mr. Coats's letter adopted the latter argument, saying the administration supports permanently reauthorizing the provision even though the system was dysfunctional. He noted that "as technology changes, our adversaries' tradecraft and communications habits will continue to evolve and adapt," suggesting that such a system might become more useful.
While extending the three other provisions is less disputed, their fate will now be caught up in a broader debate about the phone records law. Privacy advocates, including Patrick Toomey of the American Civil Liberties Union, called for Congress to instead let the phone records program die.
"It's long past time that this surveillance program was shuttered once and for all," Mr. Toomey said. "The NSA has been vacuuming up hundreds of millions of Americans' call records as part of a program that is hopelessly complex and lacks any discernible evidence of its value. We should not leave such a sweeping, unaccountable power in the hands of our spy agencies."
The Times reported last month that the House Judiciary Committee has already started drafting a bill to extend the three expiring F.B.I. tools, but without extending the N.S.A. phone records program.
The N.S.A.'s ability to gain access to and analyze Americans' domestic calling records traces back to the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, when the Bush administration set up its then-secret Stellarwind program. It was a basket of surveillance and bulk data collection activities that relied on a raw claim of executive power to bypass legal constraints.
One component of the program collected customer calling records from large telecoms like AT&T and MCI, which later became Verizon. The N.S.A. used the metadata -- logs showing who contacted whom, but not what was said -- as a social map, scrutinizing indirect links between people as it hunted for hidden associates of known terrorism suspects.
In 2006, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court began issuing secret orders requiring the companies to participate in the program.
The orders were based on a creative and disputed interpretation of Section 215 of the Patriot Act, which said the F.B.I. may obtain business records "relevant" to a terrorism investigation. The spy court decided that all records could be seen as "relevant" -- a theory that a federal appeals court would later reject as stretching the law too far.
But the bulk phone records program clearly came into public view only in June 2013 when The Guardian published the first revelation from the trove of classified files leaked by Mr. Snowden, the former intelligence contractor. It was a top-secret surveillance court order to Verizon requiring it to give the N.S.A. a copy of all customer calling records.
In the ensuing debate, intelligence officials could not point to any specific attack the program had thwarted. But they defended it as a useful tool when new terrorism-linked phone numbers were identified, and suggested that had it been in place before Sept. 11, it might have helped uncover Al Qaeda's plot. Critics rejected the Sept. 11 argument as exaggerated and portrayed the program as ripe for abuse and as a legally dubious invasion of privacy.
Eventually, the Obama administration and Congress agreed on a reform law that would end the N.S.A.'s bulk collection of domestic calling data, but preserve its ability to swiftly gain access to records held by telecoms when a judge agreed that a specific number had terrorism links. The idea was to reduce the risk of abuse while preserving the analytical capability.
That law -- the USA Freedom Act of 2015 -- permitted the N.S.A. to build a system linking up with the telecoms under which the agency could retrieve logs of phone calls and texts for a specific suspect, as well as the logs of communications by everyone who had ever been in contact with that suspect -- even when they were customers of different phone companies.
Under the old program, the N.S.A. had been vacuuming up billions of logs about Americans' communications every day. Under the replacement Freedom Act system, that number dropped significantly, although its scale remained large in absolute terms. In 2016, the agency obtained orders to target 42 suspects and collected 151 million records. In 2017, it obtained orders to target 40 suspects and collected 534 million records.
But public signs of trouble with the Freedom Act system began to emerge in June 2018, when the N.S.A. announced that it had discovered "technical irregularities" that caused it to collect more phone records than it had legal authority to gather.
The agency has been coy about the details, saying they are classified, but in broad strokes has said that for various reasons telecoms were returning both accurate and inaccurate numbers in the list of accounts a suspect had been in contact with. When the N.S.A. fed those numbers back into the system to get the "second hop" of calling data from the suspect's contacts, it compounded the problem.
Unable to separate the good data from the bad, the agency deleted its entire collection of Americans' phone records -- hundreds of millions of communications logs -- and started over. But in October 2018, it discovered that the problem was happening again, and, once again, had to purge the data, according to a recently declassified inspector general report.
The recurring headaches, including the inability of the N.S.A. to verify whether the data returned from the phone companies was accurate and the relatively low value of the intelligence that was being gleaned from it, contributed to an intelligence community decision in late 2018 to start winding the program down, officials familiar with the matter have said.
A slightly garbled sign of that move first came to light in March, when a senior Republican congressional aide said in a national security podcast interview, with what was apparently overstatement in terms of the timing, that the N.S.A. had not been using the program "for the past six months." But for months, the government had refused to say what its status was.

Texto completo: Forty years after the Iranian Revolution, U.S. media coverage of Iran is still so overwhelmingly focused on the country's fraught relationship with the United States that certain images have become tropes. Stock photographs of chador-clad women; shown in profile, their faces almost invisible as they walk past anti-American street murals, are published with ludicrous frequency.
A new exhibition at the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery, "My Iran: Six Women Photographers," aims to challenge the stereotype of voiceless Iranian women, presenting a more nuanced view of the country through the work of some of its most talented contemporary photographers.
Almost all the works in "My Iran" are drawn from the Sackler's permanent collection, and most have been acquired since 2011, when the museum began a push to add work by modern and contemporary Iranian photographers, complementing the Smithsonian's extensive holdings of 19th-century photos from Iran under the Qajar dynasty (1789-1925).
"My Iran" opens with an arresting 5 1/2 -minute video (the only video work on view) by Newsha Tavakolian, one of the show's six artists, along with Gohar Dashti, Shadi Ghadirian, Hengameh Golestan, Malekeh Nayiny and Mitra Tabrizian. "Somayeh" shows a woman in richly hued attire - black dress, sienna overcoat, turquoise headscarf, brown purse and shoes - standing against a large tree, a few clear plastic bags caught in its naked gray branches. As the camera slowly zooms in, the woman's headscarf and the plastic bags sway slightly in the breeze, but she herself is immobile, her expression somber but resolute.
The story of Somayeh - a teacher at a girls' school who waited seven years for permission to divorce her husband - is told in greater detail in an accordion-style album of about a dozen candid photos, part of Tavakolian's series "Blank Pages of an Iranian Photo Album."
Tavakolian's reportorial style reflects her background as a photojournalist for the Magnum photo agency and the New York Times, before she branched out to more artistic photography. In an unfortunate reminder of the challenges faced by artists and journalists in Iran, the Times revealed in June that Tavakolian and its Tehran correspondent Thomas Erdbrink - Tavakolian's husband - had been denied press permits to work since February. (The Sackler's decision to include Tavakolian's work was made before this news emerged.)
"My Iran" includes only one set of purely documentary photographs: eight black-and-white shots by Golestan, showing women protesting the post-revolution introduction of Iran's hijab law on March 8, 1979 - which ended up being the last day that women went out uncovered. The photos capture the women's anger and defiance, as well as the euphoria of their spontaneous mass demonstration.
Since the Islamic revolution, female Iranian photographers have largely turned away from such a documentary approach, in favor of styles that offer greater creative possibilities and space for social commentary.
As the show's curator, Massumeh Farhad, noted at a press preview, "The subsequent restrictions on Iranian society and culture [after the revolution] meant that many of the photographers turned to carefully staged, cinematic style, largely inspired by Iran's new-wave photography of the '90s."
Some of the most compelling works of that nature come from three series by Dashti, who uses varied genres to stage sometimes mysterious narratives. The hyper-realistic photos in "Home," for instance - featuring abandoned buildings overflowing with plants placed there by the artist - can be read in one of two ways: as hopeful signs of nature's rebirth, or as eerily post-apocalyptic. (Along with Tavakolian and Ghadirian - who creates satirical versions of sepia-toned, Qajar-era cartes de visite - Dashti was featured in the National Museum of Women in the Arts' 2016 exhibition "She Who Tells a Story: Women Photographers From Iran and the Arab World.")
Dashti's "Iran, Untitled" series is more absurdist. One image shows some 20 men and women with suitcases, all lined up behind traffic cones and craning their heads as if expecting a plane to appear any minute - in the middle of the steppe. The setting - an apparent Nowhereland - seems an apt metaphor for Iranians' uncertainty about the future.
Tabrizian, a London-based photographer who is also a filmmaker, employs a more cinematic realism in her "Border" series, poignantly capturing Iranian exiles and revealing a deeply palpable sense of displacement and loss. In one photo, a weary-looking elderly woman is seated by a suitcase, against a bluish wall with a closed door; in another, an older man stares out blankly from a dingy auto shop containing a wrecked car and a black cat.
There's something universal about Tabrizian's large yet intimate portraits: they could have been taken just about anywhere. More than any other images in this show, perhaps, they evoke a feeling of empathy with their subjects - an awareness that, in many U.S. narratives about Iran, is sorely lacking.
Art, it is sometimes said, has the power to change hearts and minds. If only we all could be so swayed.

Texto completo: The jail cell death this weekend of Jeffrey Epstein, the wealthy financier who faced federal sex trafficking charges, has gotten people talking.
Here's a brief review what we know about his death, compiled from Globe wire services and major media reports.
■ Epstein's body was found Saturday morning in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York. Immediately, conspiracy theories pinballed around the Internet, fueled by Epstein's past links to a number of rich, famous, and powerful people, including President Trump, former president Bill Clinton, and England's Prince Andrew.
■ On Sunday, the office of the New York City medical examiner said it had completed an autopsy of Epstein but indicated it was waiting for more information from investigators before releasing a determination about the cause of death. A city official said at the time that the office was confident that the cause of death was suicide by hanging, the New York Times reported.
■ The Washington Post reported Thursday that Epstein, who had previously served time for Florida state charges of soliciting and procuring a person under 18 for prostitution, had suffered multiple broken neck bones. Among the bones broken was the hyoid bone, which in men is near the Adam's apple. Such breaks can occur in those who hang themselves, but they are more common in victims of homicide by strangulation. The Post said the finding “deepened the mystery about his death."
■ Attorney General William Barr has promised an investigation and accountability. The warden at the jail was removed Tuesday, and two guards who were supposed to be watching Epstein were placed on leave during the investigation. The move came amid evidence that the federal jail may have bungled in its responsibility to keep Epstein alive. He was supposed to be checked by a guard every 30 minutes, but the checks were not done for several hours before he was found Saturday morning, a source told The Associated Press.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – A federal judge on Thursday barred Georgia from using its direct-recording electronic voting machines beyond this year, adding that the state should have hand-marked paper ballots prepared if its new system isn’t in place for the 2020 presidential primaries.
U. S. District Court Judge Amy Totenberg's decision comes after a request to move the state to hand-marked paper ballots. Totenberg criticized years of inaction from the state, writing in her ruling that Georgia officials "have been slow and poorly equipped in tackling the security and functionality challenges afflicting its current voting system. "
“Georgia’s current voting equipment, software, election and voter databases, are antiquated, seriously flawed, and vulnerable to failure, breach, contamination, and attack,” she wrote.
Totenberg also noted that although Georgia is now moving in the right direction, she is doubtful that it can implement a new system before the March 24, 2020, presidential primary.

Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger last month announced that the state purchased a new voting system that has touchscreen computers and also prints paper records. The system cost $106 million and Raffensperger said it would be implemented before next year's primary.
Last year, ahead of the state's 2018 gubernatorial election, Totenberg declined to make a similar ruling that would have required an immediate switch to hand-marked paper ballots.
Stacey Abrams, the Democratic gubernatorial candidate last year, has been outspoken about voting rights and fighting voter oppression in the state. Abrams lost the race to Republican Brian Kemp, who was then the Georgia secretary of state.

On Tuesday, Abrams announced an initiative called Fair Fight 2020, which aims to staff and fund voter protection teams in battleground states across the country ahead of the 2020 elections.
The new program comes in lieu of Abrams running for president, something she had repeatedly said she was considering earlier this year.
During an interview with The New York Times earlier this week, Abrams said she'd asked two things of all the Democratic 2020 presidential candidates she's met with so far: "One is that they make voter suppression their number one issue. And two, that they make Georgia a top priority because it is a battleground state. "

O’Rourke to relaunch campaign, skip Senate run

Texto completo: Beto O’Rourke will return to the presidential campaign trail Thursday for the first time since the Aug. 3 massacre of 22 people at a Walmart in his hometown by a suspect who told police he was hunting “Mexicans” and who O’Rourke said drew “vile inspiration” from President Donald Trump.
According to O’Rourke’s campaign, he will relaunch with a speech the morning in El Paso that will outline the path forward for a presidential campaign that began with great promise five months ago but is now mired at 2% in national polls.
O’Rourke has been importuned with increasing urgency, both publicly and privately, to consider swapping his struggling presidential campaign for a more promising and potentially more consequential second run for the U.S. Senate, challenging the reelection of U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas.
“He just needs to get home and take care of business,” former Houston Mayor Annise Parker told The New York Times in the aftermath of the El Paso tragedy. “We wouldn’t have five people running for Senate if Beto came back.”
An Emerson College poll conducted during the first three days of August found that more than half of Texas Democrats thought O’Rourke should run for Senate instead of president.
The poll found that most Democratic voters had not formed an opinion on the Senate race without O’Rourke, and that none of the candidates already in the race had gained much traction.
The filing deadline for the March primary is not until December, but Thursday’s announcement by O’Rourke would seem to effectively foreclose the possibility that he would enter a race now so crowded with lesser-known candidates that it appears destined for a May runoff — potentially hobbling chances of defeating the state’s senior senator.
While not campaigning for the past 11 days, O’Rourke has been squarely in the public eye since his return to his wounded, grieving hometown. He has emerged as an unscripted and unbound voice of hurt, anger and outrage directed at a president he believes can only properly be identified as a “white supremacist,” and at a broader media landscape he believes amplifies the president’s dangerous rhetoric.
In a crystallizing moment captured on video the evening after the shooting, a reporter asked O’Rourke, “Is there anything in your mind that the president could do now to make this any better?”
“What do you think? You know the s--- he’s been saying. He’s been calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals,” O’Rourke replied with visible emotion. “It’s these questions that you know the answers to. I mean, connect the dots about what he’s been doing in this country. He’s not tolerating racism; he’s promoting racism. He’s not tolerating violence; he’s inciting racism and violence in this country. So, you know, I just — I don’t know what kind of question that is.”
The moment prompted the Houston Chronicle to publish an unusual editorial last weekend pressing O’Rourke to switch races.
“The chances of winning the race you’re in now are vanishingly small. And Texas needs you,” the Chronicle said.
O’Rourke was a three-term congressman from El Paso who came out of political nowhere to fall just 2.6 points short of defeating U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz in 2018.
On the way to losing, O’Rourke became a media sensation, raising more money than any U.S. Senate candidate in history and emerging as a national Democratic hero and household name.
O’Rourke’s presidential campaign got off to a very fast start in mid-March, but the media narrative quickly turned on him, painting him as just another privileged, self-involved white guy.
The argument for a change of heart is that O’Rourke could do more to put Texas in play, not only in the Senate race but in the presidential race, as a candidate campaigning full time in his home state.
If he did that, the argument went, he would be able to reclaim his status as a national Democratic hero and fundraising phenomenon.
In the last Democratic candidate debate in July, O’Rourke pitched his ability to put Texas’ 38 electoral votes in play, but the Emerson poll showed Vice President Joe Biden running ahead of him among Texas Democrats. Both Biden and Vermont’s Sen. Bernie Sanders, the poll found, were leading Trump in a general election matchup by 2 points, while O’Rourke was trailing by 4 points.
From the outset, O’Rourke has presented himself as a stark alternative to Trump on the president’s signature issue — immigration and the border.
El Paso was his touchstone, and O’Rourke would sing its praises at virtually every stop on the Senate and presidential campaign trail in what amounted to an opening prayer.
With the Walmart killings, El Paso changed for O’Rourke from a sacred space that refuted Trump’s rhetoric about a menacing “invasion” along the southern border to a community that was bleeding because of Trump’s rhetoric.
Beginning Thursday, he is hoping that his preaching the gospel of El Paso can propel him to the White House.

Portland works to move migrant families out of Expo

Texto completo: City officials say they will meet the deadline to move remaining families out of the basketball arena by Thursday evening and are moving dozens of people into housing Wednesday and Thursday.

After finding housing for more than 200 people who have been staying in an emergency shelter at the Portland Expo, city officials said Wednesday they will meet a looming deadline to move all migrant families out of the professional basketball arena by the end of Thursday.
Officials also said they now hope to avoid moving any of the remaining families to another temporary overnight shelter in the Salvation Army gym.
Since early June, 437 people — mostly asylum seekers from Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo — have flowed into the city from the southern U.S. border and arrived at the Portland Expo, which the city converted into an emergency shelter to handle the sudden influx. City officials say they need to close the shelter Thursday so the facility can be turned back over to the Maine Red Claws basketball team, which plans to resurface the basketball court before the beginning of its training camp.
Families who have not been moved into apartments or host homes by Thursday will be moved to Portland’s Family Shelter or, if there is no room available there, into the gymnasium at the Salvation Army.
Officials in Portland and nearby communities, immigrant community leaders and nonprofit groups have been working intensely to find permanent or temporary housing for the 132 people who remained at the Expo at the beginning of this week, a difficult task given the tight housing market in southern Maine. By Wednesday afternoon, the number of people at the Expo had dropped to 118 and more were expected to move into temporary housing or host homes by Thursday afternoon.
City Hall Communications Director Jessica Grondin said 212 people have been placed in temporary housing in multiple communities in southern Maine. City funding and the state’s General Assistance voucher program helps pay for rents. An additional 30 families have moved into temporary host homes, according to the Greater Portland Council of Governments, which helped to set up and coordinate the program.
On Wednesday, 12 people moved out of the Expo into housing in Scarborough, while another 28 more were expected to move Thursday into temporary housing in Brunswick and Bath. Families have also moved into temporary housing in Lewiston and Portland.
Papy Kashama Bongibo, president of the Congolese Community of Maine, said he believes only three to five families will still be waiting for temporary housing by Thursday afternoon.
At the Expo on Wednesday afternoon, a handful of parents packed suitcases and bags while their children played nearby. Dozens of cots used by families that have found other housing were stacked along one wall. At the back of the gym, children crawled into forts they made out of suitcases, sheets and overturned portable cribs.
Grondin said the temporary shelter at the Expo will begin closing after lunch is served Thursday. Families still at the shelter at that time will move to the Salvation Army gym, which can accommodate 110 people.
The prospect of using the Salvation Army gym has been a source of concern. Unlike at the Expo, families would have to leave the Salvation Army gym from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. and would sleep on floor mats instead of cots. Meals have also been served at the Expo, while people who stay at the Salvation Army gym would have access to breakfasts and dinners at the city’s General Assistance office nearby.
By Wednesday afternoon, Grondin said the city may be able to avoid using that facility entirely because the remaining families may be able to stay at the Family Shelter, which provides beds and 24-hour access.
Bongibo said he was scared there would be a large number of families with no place to go during the day, and has been reaching out to churches in the community to see if they have space. But he said Wednesday he is relieved that so many have found temporary housing.
“Now it’s manageable. We can find a space for them,” he said. “As a community, we’re trying to do what we can to help.”
Bongibo said he has spoken with many of the asylum seekers who had been staying at the Expo and heard no negativity from them about their new housing arrangements. The families that have moved into host homes are excited to be welcomed by the host families, he said.
“They’re giving families a chance to start a better life,” Bongibo said of the host families.
Families inside the Expo on Wednesday were nervous about sharing their stories with reporters and declined to be interviewed, but Bongibo said they are looking forward to moving into more permanent housing.
Margaret Born, a 23-year-old New Hampshire resident who grew up in southern Africa, has been volunteering two or three days a week to play with children at the Expo. After reading a New York Times article about the influx of asylum seekers into Maine, she felt compelled to volunteer because she speaks both French and Portuguese.
As asylum seekers packed belongings and talked to city employees, Born sat on the floor in the middle of the Expo to play with three small children. The children who have been attending summer school in Portland have shared with her their excitement about new backpacks and colored pencils, while their parents enthusiastically practice English with her, she said.
“This space was really hard for them. There’s no privacy and no quiet,” Born said. “The parents are so exhausted. They have to navigate this whole new world with a language they barely speak.”
After the shelter at the Expo closes Thursday, city employees will continue to locate housing for the families that remain in the city’s shelter system. Some of the nearly $1 million donated to the city to help asylum seekers was used to hire two extra housing counselors and two extra financial eligibility specialists, Grondin said.

Texto completo: A woman who accused Jeffrey Epstein of forcibly raping her as a child has filed a civil lawsuit against his estate, girlfriend, and three household staff, alleging that they enabled the abuse.
Jennifer Araoz said she was repeatedly subjected to sexual abuse from Epstein when she was 14- and 15-years old, including a 2002 forcible rape in his New York City townhouse. She previously disclosed the story in July and noted that she intended to sue the disgraced millionaire, but after the 66-year-old was found dead of an apparent suicide, Araoz has now set her sights on those she said enabled the abuse.
The complaint, which includes a secretary, a maid, and a “recruiter” in addition to Epstein’s longtime girlfriend, alleges that Epstein’s girlfriend, 57-year-old Ghislaine Maxwell recruited and provided logistical support for the financier’s sexual abuse. The suit claims Maxwell and the other three unnamed staffers “conspired with each other to make possible and otherwise facilitate the sexual abuse and rape" of Araoz.
Araoz alleged today that Maxwell “conspired with Epstein in the implementation and maintenance of his criminal enterprise which, in turn, victimized” her. The complaint referenced other court documents which purportedly show Maxwell helped Epstein recruit underage girls, scheduled their appointments, intimidated witnesses, provided oversight over his operation, and kept it all secret. Araoz said Maxwell helped ensure three girls a day were “made available” to Epstein “for his sexual pleasure.”
Ghislaine Maxwell
“Today is my first step towards reclaiming my power,” Araoz told reporters Wednesday after the suit was filed. “Jeffrey Epstein and his network of enablers stole from me. They robbed me of my youth, my identity, my innocence, my self-worth. For too long, they escaped accountability. I am here today because I intend to change that.”
The new lawsuit amends a prior lawsuit she intended to file against Epstein and his estate before he was found dead of an apparent suicide. A deputy sheriff served Epstein with Araoz’s impending lawsuit in his prison cell on July 22. A day later, on July 23, Epstein was reportedly found nearly unconscious on his cell floor with marks on his neck as the result of a possible suicide attempt.
Along with the proposed lawsuit, Epstein was also served in July with a subpoena to compel him to preserve and turn over records identifying all of his employees as well as logs of all the visitors to his home from the start of 2000 through the end of 2003. Last Friday, Epstein’s lawyers called Araoz’s request “an utter waste of judicial resources” and said it would “defy common sense” for the court to order Epstein to produce those employment records.
Epstein was found dead Saturday morning in his prison cell. He was being held in the special housing unit of the prison after being moved from suicide watch days before.
Epstein's apparent suicide followed the unsealing last Friday of 2,000 pages of court records connected to the defamation lawsuit brought by Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre against Maxwell, whom Giuffre has accused of helping Epstein abuse her and others when Giuffre was underage. The records included allegations by Giuffre that Maxwell instructed her to have sex with the U.K.'s Prince Andrew, New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, and former Sen. George Mitchell, among other high-profile figures.
Attorney General Barr vowed earlier this week that the DOJ's Epstein investigation would continue.
“Any co-conspirators should not rest easy," Barr said. "The victims deserve justice, and they will get it."
Today's suit is also one of the first filed under New York’s Child Victims Act, which went into effect Wednesday. The new law allows victims of child sex abuse to file civil lawsuits against those who allegedly abused them for the next year, regardless of when the abuse took place. From there, the accusers will have until age 55 to file lawsuits.
In a Wednesday piece in the New York Times, Araoz describes her experience of entering Epstein’s lavishly revolting life. She described stepping into his mansion in Manhattan’s Upper East Side in 2001 and noticing security cameras and TVs playing footage in real time.
“I was a child, just 14 at the time. But the message was clear: I was in the house of someone important and I was being watched,” Araoz wrote. “I can still remember watching myself on those screens as I walked into the house of the person I came to know as a predator, a pedophile, my rapist.”
Araoz described her anger about Epstein not having to answer for his crimes after his suicide, but said that her “quest for justice is just getting started.”
She said she was recruited by a stranger during her freshman year outside her performing arts high school. She said the recruiters would give her money to visit Epstein, and although the first encounters felt benign, she began getting asked to massage the financier.
“The visits were about one to two hours long and we would spend the time talking. After each visit, he or his secretary would hand me $300 in cash, supposedly to help my family,” she recounted. “But within about a month, he started asking me for massages and instructed me to take my top off. He said he would need to see my body if he was going to help me break into modeling.
“I felt uncomfortable and intimidated, but I did as he said. The assault escalated when, during these massages, he would flip over and sexually gratify himself and touch me inappropriately,” Araoz added.
She then described how during her last visit Epstein forced himself on her, held her tightly, and forcibly raped her.
Araoz said she kept quiet for years, feeling as though the “power structure was stacked against” her. She recounted struggles with anxiety and shame.
“I used to feel alone, walking into his mansion with the cameras pointing at me, but now I have the power of the law on my side,” Araoz said. “I will be seen. I will be heard. I will demand justice.”

Reading into the rise of the romance novel

Texto completo: The romance section at Porter Square Books keeps moving.
First the titles were scattered around general fiction. Then the section became a few shelves near mystery. Now it spans several bookcases at the front of the store — a place of honor.
Over the past few years, independent bookstores have begun accommodating more romance novels, finally giving due respect to a genre that has long been a top seller for the industry.
Last year, Brookline Booksmith rebuilt its dismantled romance section and An Unlikely Story in Plainville created its first romance section (the books had previously been shelved around the store). In June 2018, Harvard Book Store hosted its first romance event, for Jasmine Guillory's debut, “The Wedding Date," a contemporary tale about two people who arrange a fake date that, of course, leads to more. In February, Acton bookshop Silver Unicorn hosted an all-romance pop-up store in Somerville's Bow Market.
On Saturday,13 Massachusetts bookstoreswill have special displays, sales, and events as part of the first-ever national Bookstore Romance Day, billed by organizers as a way “to strengthen the relationships between bookstores and the romance community."
What took so long for romance to be embraced by indies and even some readers? Brookline Booksmith buyer Amy Brabenec has a theory.
“The misogyny in the world," she said. “This is a female-led genre. It's a genre that centers on women's pleasure."
According to the nonprofit Romance Writers of America — which commissions studies on the market — romance was the second-best-selling fiction category in 2016, with 23 percent of overall US fiction market sales, just behind general fiction at 27 percent and just ahead of suspense and thrillers. Still, some stores have written off romance, even as they've devoted space to other genre categories like mystery and science fiction.
Paul Swydan, who's on the Bookstore Romance Day board, admitted that when he first opened Silver Unicorn in 2018, he didn't even know what romance was. He asked Stacie Williams of Ingram Publisher Services why his section was unsuccessful and learned that the books he'd shelved weren't part of the genre. (No, he learned, Nicholas Sparks was not a romance author.)
What does count as a romance novel? The Romance Writers of America says it's defined by two principles: “a central love story and an emotionally satisfying and optimistic ending." Subgenres include paranormal, historical, and young adult. “Fifty Shades of Grey" falls under “erotic," but the RWA makes clear on its website that romance books, in general, may have “varying levels of sensuality — ranging from sweet to extremely hot."
Swydan got help from Williams, who advised him to carry authors such as contemporary and historical writer Alyssa Cole, historical romance writer (and Harvard and Smith College grad) Sarah MacLean, and legendary romance author Beverly Jenkins, who received the 2017 Romance Writers of America Nora Roberts Lifetime Achievement Award and is known for her African-American historical romance fiction.
“I've had a couple customers tell me that we have the largest romance section they've seen in the region," a proud Swydan said.
HelenKay Dimon, president of the Romance Writers of America, says there's a greater need for indies to carry romance now that chains such as Borders and Waldenbooks have closed. She said many bookstore owners like Swydan have turned to romance connoisseurs such as Williams to help them stock their stores. Dimon herself was asked to curate romance shelves for one of her local bookshops, Mysterious Galaxy, in San Diego. Guillory, a Wellesley College grad who's now a New York Times bestseller, said she was asked by East Bay Booksellers in Oakland, Calif., where she launches her titles, to assemble a “recommended by Jasmine" list for display. Guillory, whose forthcoming novel, “Royal Holiday," is inspired by Meghan Markle's mother (Doria Ragland), will become the first romance author to headline the now 11-year-old Boston Book Festival in October.
Dimon said romance authors have been happy to help these stores, which learn quickly that romance readers are prolific readers of all genres.
“They buy in bulk," she said. “They read an extraordinary amount of books at a time."
Porter Square Books manager Sarah Rettger noted that stores also see benefits from publishers supporting a wider range of authors who appeal to new readers.
“There's increasing diversity and consciousness in the writing," Rettger said. “You can be a romance fan and get stuff that's not going to make you cringe, and LGBT representation."
April Poole, one of the store's booksellers, is a fan of “Red, White & Royal Blue," a new queer romance novel from Casey McQuiston that tells the love story of Alex Claremont-Diaz, fictional first son of fictional US President Ellen Claremont, who falls in love with Prince Henry of Wales.
Cindy Hwang, vice president and editorial director at Berkley — who's responsible for a string of recent bestsellers, including Guillory's — said publishers have also been thoughtful about how the books look in stores. Not every novel needs a “clinch cover" (two people embracing). Guillory's books are released as trade paperbacks (as opposed to the tiny mass-market size), and have covers that reflect the rom-com spirit of her stories. They're very Instagram-able.
“I think that one of the barriers was the packaging," she said, explaining that younger readers want unique covers that don't look like “something their mom would read."
Dimon notes that indie stores have also been influenced by big media outlets that began paying attention to the genre. The New York Times hired Jaime Green as its romance reviewer in 2018. MacLean, whose latest historical romance is “Brazen and the Beast," covers romance for The Washington Post.
Podcaster and Harvard Divinity School graduate Vanessa Zoltan, who launched the Cambridge-based romance novel-focused podcast “Hot & Bothered" in July (its mission: to “encourage people to write romance novels as a sacred practice"), said publishers, stores, and the writers themselves can all be credited for a new attitude about romance. But she cites another reason for the genre getting more attention — and respect.
“It's [President] Trump," she said. “Trump got elected and then Harvey Weinstein and #MeToo. I think the demand came from women needing positive stories about men."
Swydan put it this way:
“Basically, so many awful things happen every day and we find out via social media way more than we used to, which is probably not great for mental health, but a book that promises a happy ending really just makes you feel better," Swydan said. “. . . And romance books, more than any other books, provide that."

Texto completo: What's on TV
DANNY'S HOUSE 10 p.m. on Viceland. The rapper Danny Brown kicks off his new hang-out-and-talk show with two guests: the comedian Ron Funches and the rapper ASAP Rocky. Rocky made news outside the music world when he was arrested and jailed in Sweden earlier this summer, a situation that became an international incident. The stakes are much lower here, with Brown kicking back on comfy retro furniture to talk with Funches and Rocky about aliens, the afterlife and the ideal U.F.O. design (wood grain and gold trim for Brown, please).
NEIGHBORS (2014) 6 p.m. on FXX. Chaotic debauchery dukes it out with marital bliss in this crude comedy, which stars Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne as young parents who can't get a good night's sleep after fraternity members move in next door. The frat is helmed by a pair of brothers played by Zac Efron and Dave Franco, who take the lead in terrorizing the couple when the relationship between the new sets of neighbors goes south. The story "ascends to an impressively high level of farcical anarchy," A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times. Scott added that the movie's director, Nicholas Stoller, is "good at keeping the momentum going while also finding time for offbeat grace notes and occasional bursts of emotional candor." For a different version of a very similar story, see NEIGHBORS 2: SORORITY RISING (2016), airing at 8 p.m. on FXX. That movie pits Rogen and Byrne's characters against a sorority whose members are portrayed by Beanie Feldstein, Chloë Grace Moretz, Awkwafina and others.
ALTERNATE ENDINGS: SIX NEW WAYS TO DIE IN AMERICA 8 p.m. on HBO. A living wake, a green burial and an extraterrestrial send-off are a few of the atypical end-of-life events shown in this documentary, which showcases a handful of people who have chosen nontraditional methods of dying or committal to the grave, and how their decisions affect their loved ones.
What's Streaming
SACRED GAMES Stream on Netflix. Netflix's adaptation of Vikram Chandra's bloody 2006 gangster novel returns for a second season. The show tells the story of Sartaj Singh (Saif Ali Khan), a detective who spent the first season knee-deep in the Mumbai underworld. (In his review for The Times, Mike Hale called that season "energetic and entertaining, if not entirely satisfying.") Season 2 involves a mysterious cult.
THE ANGRY BIRDS MOVIE (2016) Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. With "The Angry Birds Movie 2" hitting theaters this week, families might enjoy catching up on this animated movie based on the popular video game. Discerning children might want to opt out, though: In his review for The Times, Glenn Kenny referred to it as "not much beyond a superficially amiable ball of fluff."

New Ebola treatments prove effective

Texto completo: Two experimental treatments to treat Ebola infection work so well that they will now be offered to all patients in the Democratic Republic of Congo, scientists announced Monday.
The antibody-based treatments are so powerful that they raise hopes that the disastrous epidemic in eastern Congo can soon be stopped. "Now we can say that 90% can come out of treatment cured," one scientist said.
Many families in the epidemic zone have been hiding their sick or bringing them in near death, too late to save. The epidemic has infected about 2,800 known patients and has killed more than 1,800 of them, according to the World Health Organization.
The treatments, known as REGN-EB3 and mAb-114, are both monoclonal antibodies that are infused intravenously into the blood and attach themselves to the outside of the virus, preventing it from invading the patient's cells.
The two treatments were part of a four-treatment trial that has been run with about 700 patients since November. They worked so well that a data-monitoring committee that met Friday immediately recommended that the other two treatments, ZMapp and remdesivir, be stopped and that all patients be offered REGN-EB3 and mAb-114.
Among patients who were brought into treatment centers with low viral loads - which suggested that they had been infected only days before - only 6% of those who got REGN-EB3 died, and only 11% of those who got mAb-114 died, according to Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
By contrast, 33% of those who received remdesivir, an antiviral drug, and 24% of those who got ZMapp, an older cocktail of monoclonal antibodies, died.
The difference in mortality rates between REGN-EB3 and mAb-114 was considered too small to be statistically significant, Fauci said.
It is helpful to have two options in case supply problems develop with one drug or the other, said Dr. Michael Ryan, director of emergency response for the World Health Organization.
The WHO and the NIAID made the announcement in conjunction with Dr. Jean-Paul Muyembe, director of Congo's National Institute for Biomedical Research.
The makers of the two treatments gave assurances that they could make enough doses to treat all patients, Fauci said.
Muyembe, 77, who has been fighting Ebola since it first appeared in 1976, pioneered the use of survivors' blood - which contains antibodies - in order to save patients. The two treatments that proved successful last week descend in part from his original research.
Asked how he felt about that during a telephone news conference, Muyembe said through a translator: "I'm a little sentimental. I had this idea a long time ago, and I've waited patiently for it. I'm very happy, and I can't believe it."
Fauci called him a "true hero."

The Democrats' cynical Kavanaugh ploy

Texto completo: What are Democrats up to?
The House Judiciary Committee, under the leadership of Chairman Jerry Nadler, a Democrat from New York, is trying to revive the fight over Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
Nadler is trying to obtain, before their official release date, Kavanaugh’s emails from when he served in the Office of the White House Counsel and as President George W. Bush’s staff secretary.
Nadler’s interest in the early release of emails sent to Kavanaugh, even as carbon copies or blind carbon copies, hints at an unrestricted fishing expedition into Bush administration history. Everything in the office went through Kavanaugh, as Republican senators pointed out during the confirmation process.
There are few things political opponents would like more than attorney-client work product of the other party’s leaders, and Kavanaugh’s nomination gives Nadler an excuse to get it.
Or perhaps this could be an effort to suss out more about who knew what and when in 2003, when Republicans gained unauthorized access to Democrats’ emails on the Senate Judiciary Committee, revealing evidence that the committee’s Democrats were blocking judicial nominees such as Miguel Estrada based on their race.
Democrats also think there’s a political win to be had here. Dragging Kavanaugh back onto the stage gives them a chance to wave their “War on Women” flag. Although the sexual assault charges against Kavanaugh ranged from the unsubstantiated to the absurd, Democrats saw a political gain from fighting the fight, and they want to do it again ahead of 2020.
But perhaps the best way to think of the Democrats’ latest effort is to recall Britain’s hanging of their own Adm. John Byng, as relayed in Voltaire’s Candide. Once in a while, it was explained, one needs to hang an admiral “pour encourager les autres” (to encourage the others).
The liberal groups who work on judicial appointments are intimately tied in with the leadership of the Democratic Party. They take a long view to the cultural and legal war they are waging.
That was why leftist groups have prioritized blocking black, Hispanic, and female conservatives from the lower federal courts: They fear such nominees would be harder to oppose further down the line in the bright light of a Supreme Court battle.
Also, part of the liberal groups’ strategy is that whenever they can’t win a nomination, they will inflict as much pain as possible. We’ve seen this consistently since Republicans took over the Senate after Harry Reid scrapped the filibuster for lower court nominations. They had little or no chance of defeating any Trump nominees while Republicans controlled the chamber, so they did their best to brand the nominees as extremists, attack their religion, and otherwise make their lives unpleasant.
This is why they want all Kavanaugh's old emails. It’s a means of imposing more pain on Kavanaugh, whose life and career Democrats tried to destroy during the 2018 confirmation hearings. Did he ever make any unkind jokes in an email or pass along a stray inappropriate message? Did embarrassing personal matters pop up in his work email?
The Left’s primary goal in judicial battles is to block any nonliberal nominees. The secondary goal is to ruin the life of the nominees.
Do that enough, and you send a message to other conservative legal scholars, attorneys, and state judges: Don’t even think of trying to get on the federal court. It’s not worth what we’re going to do to you.
There are plenty of reasons, it turns out, for Democrats to launch their Kavanaugh fishing expedition. All of them are despicable.
Photo Caption:FILE - In this Feb. 5, 2019 file photo, Supreme Court Associate Justices Neil Gorsuch, left, and Brett Kavanaugh watch as President Donald Trump arrives to give his State of the Union address to a joint session on Congress at the Capitol in Washington. President Donald Trump’s two Supreme Court appointees are on opposite sides of two of three cases the justices are deciding Tuesday. Justice Neil Gorsuch is joining the court’s liberal justices in ruling that a Washington state Indian tribe doesn’t have to pay a state fuel tax. Gorsuch says an 1855 treaty makes a “handful of modest promises” to the Yakama Nation, including the right to move goods to market freely. Justice Brett Kavanaugh is dissenting, arguing that the treaty merely gives tribal members the same right to travel as everyone else. (Doug Mills/The New York Times via AP, Pool)

Texto completo: Earlier this month, reports emerged that indicated the mega-huge Gagosian Gallery “franchise” would be expanding its reach in the Chelsea neighborhood by leasing a 7,900 square foot space on West 24th Street; space that was formerly occupied by the currently-incarcerated downtown icon Mary Boone. Gagosian isn’t the only brand-named global gallery network looking to impress in the neighborhood, however. Pace, David Zwirner and Hauser & Wirth are also jostling to reintroduce themselves to a crowded and competitive art market on a grand scale. Evidently, if you’re a gallery director looking to attract high-rolling clients to your wares, forget simply selling art. Your imperative has become the provision of services that will make the lives of the collectors you’re serving as easy and seamless as possible. This, the New York Times posits, has led to brand-name galleries “shifting their emphasis from selling and showing art to a more full-service visitor experience that offers food, performance spaces, research libraries and open storage.”

When one pictures a large and architecturally elaborate building boasting these kinds of offerings, what instantly comes to mind is a museum like the Whitney, which not-coincidentally is located right around the corner from these expanding galleries. However, the phrase “full-service visitor experience” also brings to mind a luxurious hotel that caters to the paying customer’s every need. This isn’t an accidental shift: extremely wealthy art buyers expect five-star treatment everywhere they go, including from their thoroughbred art galleries of choice.
Marc Glimcher, the president of Pace Gallery, told the Times that the future of art galleries lies in making them into places of ecstatic congregation, “like church.” Pace’s new, Bonetti/Kozerski-designed location in Chelsea opens in September. And over on West 21st Street, David Zwirner is planning the 2021 launch of a $50 million, 5-story ultra-gallery designed by Renzo Piano, the same architect who dreamed up the still-in-development Academy Museum of Motion Pictures in Los Angeles.
Maybe someday soon, well-moneyed art patrons can choose to snooze among their purchases before putting them in storage, if they wish: a full pivot to hotel-museum-gallery synergy that mirrors From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler .

Texto completo: Stocks rose after the White House delayed imposing tariffs on some consumer and electronic goods imported from China that were set to go into effect on Sept. 1.
The delay, the latest twist in the on-again off-again trade war between the world's two largest economies, pushed shares of retailers, computer-chip makers and other technology firms sharply higher. The S&P 500 index rose 1.5 percent, recovering from a 1.2 percent drop on Monday.
Investors have been unnerved recently by indications that the trade war between the United States and China was worsening quickly, so the signs of easing tension were seen as a relief.
The United States trade representative's office said that a new 10 percent tariff on roughly half the Chinese goods exported to the United States would still take effect on Sept. 1 as announced by President Trump.
But tariffs on consumer electronics, video game consoles, certain toys, computer monitors and some footwear and clothing items will be delayed until Dec. 15, giving retailers time to stockpile the products they need for the back-to-school and holiday shopping seasons.
Financial markets have been whipsawed this month after a trade truce reached in late June seemed to fall apart when President Trump threatened to impose the new tariffs and China allowed its currency to weaken sharply. Those developments suggested the two countries were girding for a prolonged battle with profound implications for the world economy.
On Tuesday, reflecting the ripples from the conflict, Singapore slashed its annual economic growth expectations to between zero and 1 percent. Investors were also reacting to unexpected election results from Argentina, which sent that country's stocks and currency plunging.
And new data published on Tuesday also indicated prospects for the German economy -- which is heavily reliant on global trade -- had worsened considerably. The ZEW indicator of economic sentiment fell 19.6 points from the month before to 44.1 points in August.
"The most recent escalation in the trade dispute between the U.S. and China, the risk of competitive devaluations and the increased likelihood of a no-deal Brexit place additional pressure on the already weak economic growth," Achim Wambach, the president of ZEW, an economic research center, said in a statement. "This will most likely put a further strain on the development of German exports and industrial production."
Outside the United States, stocks had drifted lower, though stocks in Europe recovered early losses as trading began on Wall Street.
Hong Kong led the losses among Asia's biggest markets, down 1.8 percent, as antigovernment protesters swarmed the city's busy airport for the second straight day.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index ended down 2.1 percent on Tuesday.
In Japan, the Nikkei 225 index fell 1.1 percent.
China's Shanghai Composite Index ended 0.6 percent lower, while both South Korea's Kospi index fell 0.9 percent.
Major European indexes rose. The FTSE 100 had sunk about 0.5 percent by late morning in Britain, but recovered later in the day. Germany's DAX and the CAC 40 also shook off morning slumps to rise in the afternoon.

An eggs-ellent show at Museum of Lithophanes

Texto completo: The Blair Museum of Lithophanes piqued her interest in the back-lit bas-reliefs in 2016.

Now it's showcasing hers.

Toledo's Blair Museum of Lithophanes this month opened a solo exhibit of works by Stephanie Osser, a ceramics artist who took up the delicate art of lithophanes after a trip there three years ago. In addition to showcasing her take on the centuries-old art form, the exhibit also reflects the artist's own artistic evolution in print illustration, ceramics and now lithophanes.

All About Eggs incorporates examples of each medium, all tied together by the hatching turtle illustrations that the artist said she's returned to again and again in her work. She originally published them in a children's book of the same name written by Millicent Selsam in 1980.

The museum is open 1 to 4 p.m. Saturdays and Sundays, May through October, in the Toledo Botanical Garden, 5403 Elmer Dr. All About Eggs is on exhibit until Oct. 27. Admission is free.

It's hard to put a finger on exactly why she's been so drawn to the turtle illustrations over the years, Ms. Osser said, although she said she's always been proud of that early award-winning project and the way it fit into her love of nature and children.

There's probably a more recent consideration, too, she added.

"My granddaughter loves it," she said of the book. "She reads it again and again with her family."

A lithophane is three-dimensional translucent porcelain piece, which, when back-lit, reveals a detailed image: Where the porcelain is thinner, the image is lighter; where the porcelain is thicker, the image is darker. Artists began to create them in Europe in the 1800s, incorporating them into panels and plaques, as well as night lights, lamp shades, tea cups and beer steins.

Examples of each can be found at the Blair Museum of Lithophanes, which Julia LaBay Darrah, its director and curator, said is home to the world's largest collection. The Blair Museum counts just over 3,000 in its collection, with about 400 currently on display; most date back to the 1800s, but they're complemented by some that represent a modern take on the art form.

The Blair Museum is also only museum in the world exclusively dedicated to lithophanes.

They started in France and Germany, Ms. LeBay Darrah said, so to have it here is kind of a cool experience for Toledoans.

Locals can thank the late Laurel Gotshall Blair for the unusual distinction. The native Toledoan came across a lithophane in October, 1961, and, as he would later write, fell in love. He went to amass the world's largest collection of lithophanes, according to a museum history, displaying more than a third of his collection of 2,300-plus in a private home museum by 1965.

He donated his collection to the city before he died in 1993, and in July, 2002, the Blair Museum opened in the Toledo Botanical Garden.

Ms. Osser was in Ann Arbor for the International Museum of Dinnerware Design in 2016, when Margaret Carney, a former curator of the lithophane museum and the author of a book about them, suggested she might enjoy a trip to the Blair Museum in Toledo. As her introduction to lithophanes, the extensive collection at the local museum made an impression.

I was so impressed, Ms. Osser said.

It wasn't long before she was pursuing a residency at the International Ceramic Studio in KecskemÃ©t, Hungary, to learn the technique under Ilona Romule, a notable ceramics artist from Latvia. It's there that Ms. Osser made the lithophane box illustrated with the hatching turtles that visitors can check out at her solo exhibit at the Blair Museum.

Ms. Osser will discuss her methodology, which encompasses carving, mold-making and porcelain-pouring, at a talk and workshop at the Toledo Artists' Club at the Toledo Botanical Garden on Saturday. The talk is open to the public and begins at 10 a.m.

She will also be at an artist reception at 6 p.m. Friday.

Lithophanes are in some ways a new form of illustration for Ms. Osser, who started working professionally as an artist as a print illustrator and later shifted toillustrations in clay. She said had been working toward a graduate degree in ceramics when an opportunity to illustrate a work on wildlife and anthropology presented itself. She recognized that illustration would be a practical post-academic path, and continued in that line of work for years.

Her credits include the New England Aquarium and The New York Times, as well as numerous children's books and textbooks. All About Eggs won an Outstanding Science Book for Children Award through the National Science Teachers Association.

As her children grew older, she said she was drawn again to ceramics and the less solitary community of artists around it. She honed her skills at domestic and international residencies, including stays at the Medalta Ceramic Arts Center in Canada, the International Ceramic Research Center in Denmark and the Watershed Ceramic Arts Center in Maine.

Her hatching turtles would reappear over the years in a ceramics body of work that also reflects interests in children, nature and the performing arts.

With her current work in lithophanes, she's become an illustrator in porcelain, too.

For an illustrator like me, I enjoy working on these images and the detail of them, she said.

'Glory Denied' at Union Avenue Opera explores an American tragedy

Tom Cipullo came up with the idea for his opera "Glory Denied," opening next weekend at Union Avenue Opera, at the MacDowell Colony in New Hampshire. "I should have been working," he says, "but instead I was reading the New York Times."
There he found a review of Tom Philpott's book "Glory Denied," about U.S. Army Col. Floyd James "Jim" Thompson, America's longest-held prisoner of war.
"I got it and read it cover to cover immediately. I knew I wanted to turn it into an opera." It took almost six years, but the result, premiered in 2007, has been widely acclaimed and performed.
Thompson was captured by the Vietnamese in March 1964 and wasn't released until March 1973. In solitary confinement and subjected to brutal torture, he kept himself going by thinking of his wife, Alyce, reliving their life together in his mind.
He came home to a different world. Mentally and physically traumatized, he discovered that Alyce had moved on (and moved in with another man), attempted to have him declared legally dead and told their four children -- the youngest born on the day he was captured -- that he was dead.
"It became very clear that in Col. Thompson's mind, his wife was two different people," Cipullo says. "That was the only way he could survive."
The opera has four characters, each played by two singers: Younger Thompson (a tenor), Older Thompson (baritone), Younger Alyce and Older Alyce (both sopranos). That, Cipullo says, allowed him to write ensembles. (At UAO, they'll be sung by David Walton, Peter Kendall Clark, Karina Brazas and Gina Galati, respectively. Scott Schoonover will conduct; Dean Anthony will direct.)
The characters each recall things differently. "I've always been interested in memory," Cipullo says. "It's such a tricky thing. If you talk with friends about events that happened 20 years before, you always have very different memories, completely different recollections about how those events transpired. And each one of you is convinced that your version is true and that the others are mistaken."
Cipullo, 63, never served in the armed forces. "I was 18 in 1974; the war was pretty much over." But he remembers soldiers coming home, labeled "baby killers" and publicly insulted.
"I think a lot of young people (today) don't really know a lot about the '60s," he says. "That surprises me. Col. Thompson left for Vietnam in 1964 and returned in 1973. Everything was so different. If you look at a yearbook from the mid-1960s and one from the mid-1970s, everything has changed. The counterculture, free love, 'do your own thing' -- those were all completely unthinkable in the 1960s. He must have thought he'd landed on Mars."
The marriage collapsed, and Thompson took to heavy drinking. In 1977, he attempted suicide. After suffering a stroke and heart attack in 1981, he gave up alcohol but died in 2002. Alyce died of cancer in 2009.
"He was let down by so many things in his life," Cipullo says. "It's really tragic."
Thompson was happy about the opera, Cipullo says, but died before it was completed. "When it was performed in Nashville, all four children came. You've never seen such a nervous cast. One of the daughters said, 'Yup, that's my mom up there.'"
He admits, "I really didn't like (Alyce)." She refused to allow her husband's name to be used in any way, even on one of the P.O.W. bracelets that millions wore. To be fair to her, when Cipullo wrote her big aria, "I tried to make it so beautiful, that if somebody hears it, they'll think, 'If I had four children, I'd have gone on with my life too.' She had no support; other Army wives didn't want to be around her because she was a reminder that this could happen to their husbands."
Unusually, Cipullo decided to write the opera on his own. "I did everything wrong," he says. "I am the world's worst businessman. I did not have a commission. I decided I didn't care and would just see what happened." A conductor took a chance on it; there have been over 20 productions, with more on the way. "I have been so lucky. I feel like I have a guardian angel who looks out for me."

Texto completo: CORRECTION: This story contains corrected material, published Aug. 24, 2019.
In Chicago, millions of books and people pass through the Chicago Public Library's 80 locations each year. In 2018 alone, 10.5 million books, DVDs and other materials were circulated throughout the city.
With so many books to choose from in the library system, what are Chicagoans reading the most?
Last year, the top fiction title was Celeste Ng's "Little Fires Everywhere," a New York Times best-seller about teenagers in the author's hometown of Shaker Heights, Ohio, that was checked out nearly 6,000 times.
"The Woman in the Window" by A.J. Finn, "An American Marriage" by Tayari Jones, "The Handmaid's Tale" by Margaret Atwood and "Crazy Rich Asians" by Kevin Kwan followed close behind. The fall 2018 One Book, One Chicago choice, Philip K. Dick's "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep," the basis for the "Blade Runner" movies, was ranked sixth, with 3,260 checkouts.
Most of the library's One Book, One Chicago selections rank among the 25 most popular books at the library each year. The number of One Book, One Chicago readers is probably higher, but some people likely buy the books to participate, said John Shanahan, a professor of English at DePaul University and founding researcher for Reading Chicago Reading.
The project, created in 2013, analyzes data from the One Book, One Chicago program to learn about and potentially predict reader behavior based on checkouts and holds.
The top fiction book in both 2013 and 2014 was the spectral mystery "Gone Girl" by Gillian Flynn, followed by thriller "The Girl on the Train" by Paula Hawkins and "All the Light We Cannot See" by Anthony Doerr in 2016. All 2017 data is missing because of a change in systems that year, according to a library spokeswoman.
Reading Chicago Reading has picked up on trends, including where books about Chicago do best: It turns out they're most popular in mostly white, North Side neighborhoods, Shanahan said.
Shanahan was excited to find books from all over the world are represented in the popular-fiction lists. In addition to more serious literary novels, he noted a significant presence of novels set in the past -- Colson Whitehead's "Underground Railroad" has been on the list for several years -- and genre fiction. These often complex novels have the power to take readers inside different worlds, which "deepens one's emotional range and empathy," he said.
He wasn't surprised that blockbusters like Kwan's "Crazy Rich Asians" made the list as well, noting that even literature professors enjoy casual beach reads.
The top nonfiction title of 2018 was Michael Wolff's "Fire and Fury," about the Trump administration, which was checked out 4,110 times. The rest of the most popular books were memoirs or biographies. Tara Westover's "Educated: A Memoir" and "Becoming" by Michelle Obama, as well as "I'll Take You There," a biography of Mavis Staples by Greg Kot, and "Hillbilly Elegy," a memoir by J.D. Vance, rounded out the top five.
Over the past few years, nonfiction lovers in Chicago have picked diverse literature: "The Warmth of Other Suns" by Isabel Wilkerson was the top title in 2013, followed by "Unbroken" by Laura Hillenbrand (the spelling of the last name as published has been corrected in this text) in 2014, "Yes Please" by Amy Poehler in 2015 and "When Breath Becomes Air" by Paul Kalanithi in 2016.
Popular books are a direct reflection of the political climate and current events, Shanahan said.
"Chicagoans, as shown in their reading, are aware they live in a welcoming multiethnic and multiracial space where new people arrive every day from across the U.S. and the world," he said.
"It is to me no accident that during the current presidency more people are reading 'The Handmaid's Tale,' 'Exit West' and 'An American Marriage.' These books are powerful examinations of masculinity, immigration and unequal policing."
Despite a slight dip in visitor numbers over the past few years across branches -- attributed in part to online renewal and e-books -- libraries remain an important part of community life, said Patrick Molloy, spokesman for the library. The people who frequent the libraries are often there for longer amounts of time taking advantage of nontraditional services such as education programs and computers, he said.
"Libraries are still used," Molloy said. "It just evolves the way people use them."
It's no surprise that Harold Washington and the two regional libraries, Sulzer and Woodson, are consistently popular. But Chinatown has boasted robust attendance since it opened in 2015, now ranking just behind the regional libraries in attendance, followed in numbers by the Albany Park and Edgewater branches.
As libraries are prominent civic institutions, analysis of circulation data can reveal important things about people within a city, Shanahan said.
The lists of popular books are proof that Chicagoans are eager to learn about diverse experiences. Reading these books can spark community-building and complex conversations.
"When so much of social media tempts us to simply reinforce our views and turn other people and other ways of life into cartoons and caricatures to knock down, reading serious fiction demands that we spend time 'inside' someone else's experience," Shanahan said. "That can be humanizing."

Texto completo: In August 1969 — a time of cultural upheaval more tangibly disruptive than that of the current day — more than 400,000 people and 32 musical acts found their way to a dairy farm in New York for "An Aquarian Exposition: 3 Days of Peace & Music."
The event, which would become known in the American vernacular as Woodstock, was a legendary failure — which is to say, a failure that became a legend.
The location was settled late in the planning process. Roads clogged with traffic. Grounds got muddy. The organizers gave up control of the gates. The masses were fed by the grace and generosity of area residents but also by the euphoria of mind-altering additives. In short, it was groovy.
Naturally, then, there's nostalgia. The last few years have seen a cavalcade of 50th anniversaries — not just tragedies but also triumphs like the moon landing. A Woodstock 50 festival would have had to be in the works. But like its progenitor, the effort suffered organizational woes. The location was elusive. Ticket information was, too. On Wednesday (July 31), festival organizers gave up the ghost.
Perhaps it's best to leave Woodstock to its legacy. The original festival was a communitarian moment during a movement of the same — lightning in a bottle. In today's fraught environment of public safety and accountability, it's hard to imagine pulling off any such gathering with casual disregard.
In any case, today's young people have other interests. Like video games, to name one. According to a Washington Post-University of Massachusetts Lowell poll in 2018, almost three-quarters of Americans ages 14 to 21 had either played or watched multiplayer online games or competitions in the previous year.
Last month, the 16-year-old winner of the inaugural Fortnite World Cup took home $3 million. About 40 million players had tried to qualify for the competition. "The point of the game is simple," the New York Times once reported for the sake of those who don't play: "Be the last man, woman or child standing. Kill everyone else."
It's wrong, as it was at the time of Woodstock, to try to pinpoint the motivating thrust of an entire generation. But it's worth wondering, as the British singer/songwriter Nick Lowe did in 1973 as the hippie movement was fading out: What's so funny about peace, love and understanding?

Coming to terms with a fortune’s dark roots

Texto completo: Valley News Business Writer
Emily Landecker’s name is not a familiar one in the Upper Valley, and the legacy established in her honor has been shrouded in secrecy.
But the Emily Landecker Foundation has had a profound impact in the region as the source of funding for the Upper Valley Aquatic Center in Hartford, providing millions of dollars over the years to build and maintain the indoor swimming facility.
Typically, benefactors seek recognition or public applause for their gifts — just look to the alumni names adorning any building on the Dartmouth College campus or The Jack and Dorothy Byrne Foundation, set up by the late insurance magnate and Etna resident Jack Byrne and his wife, Dorothy Byrne, which has given countless sums to scores of Upper Valley institutions and whose family name is affixed to the Haven shelter residence in White River Junction, to a hall at Dartmouth’s Tuck School of Business, and to the new palliative and hospice care center at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center.
Yet, with nothing known about Emily Landecker, she was as good as anonymous.
Who was Emily Landecker?

When the Valley News inquired last year as part of a series of stories about UVAC, people associated with the foundation declined to provide any information about Landecker — who she was, where she came from or what she did — citing a desire for privacy by Hanover resident Andrea Reimann-Ciardelli and her family, the foundation’s officers and by extension UVAC benefactors.
But the mystery of Emily Landecker and the guarded privacy of Reimann-Ciardelli, who is Landecker’s daughter, and her family was pierced two months ago when The New York Times published an extraordinary story about Emily Landecker’s life under the headline “Nazis Killed Her Father. Then She Fell in Love With One.” The story was accompanied by photographs of a darkly beautiful woman and her no less handsome paramour, two lovers who shared a secret relationship that much of the world probably cannot fathom.
That’s because Emily Landecker was the daughter of a Jewish father who was murdered by the Nazis during World War II and whose three children, including Reimann-Ciardelli, were fathered by an avowed Nazi sympathizer who used forced labor at his company that later became one of biggest consumer brand conglomerates in the world — and half a century later endowed his heirs, including Emily Landecker’s children, with immense wealth from which the Upper Valley benefits today.
“I created the Emily Landecker Foundation in 2004 to honor my mother,” Andrea Reimann-Ciardelli said in a written statement to the Valley News, the first time she has spoken publicly about her family history. “She saw extreme hardship, terror and destruction in her young life. Despite never having had much money at her disposal, she regularly donated to charitable organizations, even if only in small amounts.
“I strongly believe those who are fortunate to have wealth also have an obligation to support their community,” Reimann-Ciardelli said.
Born and raised in Germany, Reimann-Ciardelli has lived unpretentiously in Hanover for 38 years with her husband, Thomas Ciardelli, the son of a World War II truck driver who landed on Utah Beach in France a couple of weeks after D-Day and later started his own fuel delivery service in Milford, N.H. They met when Andrea Reimann was a graduate student in molecular biology at the Max Planck Institute for Medical Research in Heidelberg, Germany, where her future husband had moved for post-doc work after receiving his Ph.D. from the University of New Hampshire.
The couple later moved to the Upper Valley when Ciardelli got a job at the White River Junction VA Medical Center before joining the Geisel School of Medicine, then Dartmouth Medical School, where he eventually became a professor of pharmacology before retiring and operating Hanover Outdoors, a clothing and fishing gear store in Hanover that closed in 2012.
The Emily Landecker Foundation’s most recent tax filing with the New Hampshire Charitable Trusts Unit reports net assets of $30.2 million and charitable contributions of $8 million from 2013 to 2017 and $781,000 in 2018. About 40 nonprofits from the Upper Valley were among the charities that benefited last year, including $145,000 to the Upper Valley Land Trust, $224,500 to the Vermont Institute of Natural Science and $25,000 to the Alliance for Vermont Communities. And federal tax returns filed by Sports Venue Foundation, the entity that operates the Upper Valley Aquatic Center, show that the Emily Landecker Foundation and Reimann-Ciardelli together gave a total of $5.1 million to UVAC for the years 2014 through 2016 — a period that encompasses when the swimming facility underwent a $4.4 million expansion.
Reimann-Ciardelli was mostly unknown until Forbes magazine several years ago identified her, with a net worth of $1.1 billion, as the wealthiest person in New Hampshire (the magazine, which doesn’t say how it estimated that number, has subsequently downgraded her fortune to $720 million).
But this much is certain: The source of Reimann-Ciardelli’s wealth was generated by the 2003 sale of her ownership stake in her family’s business, the German consumer products company JAB Holding Co., which owns Lysol, Jimmy Choo shoes, Krispy Kreme Doughnuts, Peet’s Coffee, Keurig, Einstein Bros. Bagels and the Panera Bread chain, among other marquee brands.
JAB Holding Co.’s roots go back to the early 19th century with its founding as an industrial chemical company. In the 1850s, it came under the control of Ludwig Reimann, a chemist. For the next 150 years the company, then named Benckiser, evolved into a small- to medium-size company that made and sold supplements to the food industry before transforming in the early 2000s into a consumer brand giant, according to the company’s website.
The conglomerate now has a Harvard-educated non-family chairman, Peter Harf, but two Reimann family descendants continue to own a large share of the company, and Reimann family members count among Germany’s wealthiest citizens. Despite its nearly 200-year history, JAB Holding — and the Reimann family wealth — is only a relatively recent phenomenon and is credited to the arrival of Harf in 1981.
Moreover, it was Harf, whose father also had been a Nazi, who pushed the company to confront and come clean about its past, according to The New York Times. As JAB Holding’s acquisition of brand-name companies drew more scrutiny to the once-obscure maker of industrial cleaners, Harf told the newspaper that he grew skeptical of the brief dealing of the war period in the company’s official two-volume corporate history.
“I knew the stories they told. It didn’t smell right,” he told the newspaper.
Like many German companies with long histories, JAB Holding in recent years has come to reckon with its involvement with the country’s Nazi government through the 1930s and World War II. A study commissioned in 2016 by JAB Holding’s chairman and undertaken by a University of Munich scholar found that JAB Holding’s predecessor company, Benckisier, used about 200 civilians captured by the Nazis from France, Ukraine, Italy and the Netherlands as forced laborers at its factories (although it didn’t use concentration camp labor as many large German companies did), according to a preliminary report released to the public.
Most unsettling, the JAB Holding investigation found that Albert Reimann Jr. and his father, Albert Reimann Sr., who ran Benckiser, “were outspoken in their anti-Semitism and ardent supporters of Adolf Hitler,” says the foundation recently established in the name of Emily Landecker’s father, which aims to advance a reconciliation program funded by Reimann family heirs. “Both father and son attended speeches by Hitler in the 1920s and subsequently joined the Nazi party as well as making donations to the SS.”
Despite the Reimann Jr. and Sr.’s full-throated embrace of Nazism under Hitler, the investigation into Benckiser’s conduct during that dark period of German history concluded the family “was not involved in private enrichment or illegal gains through the expropriation of Jewish property or assets,” the foundation says.
Reimann Jr.’s profession at the time might not have been unusual among Germans who supported Adolf Hitler. But the relationship he struck up with a 19-year-old clerk named Emilie Landecker (the Hanover-based foundation in her name uses the Anglicized “Emily”) blossomed into a lifetime extramarital affair that produced three billionaire heirs who each had to come to terms with a horrible secret: Their father — and by extension their fortune — had undeniable ties to and benefited from the Nazis.
Stranger yet, the family learned and The New York Times reported, Emilie Landecker was the daughter of a successful Jewish accountant and Catholic mother. Her father, Alfred Landecker, raised Emilie and her siblings after their mother died in 1928. When Alfred Landecker saw the Nazis’ virulent anti-Semitism sweep Germany in the 1930s, he had his children baptized Catholic, a decision that no doubt spared their lives.
But, as a Jew himself, Alfred Landecker’s fate was sealed: The Gestapo came for him in 1942 and, after a couple of letters, the Landecker children never again heard from their father, one of the millions who perished in the death camps of the Holocaust.
Emilie Landecker, the oldest of the three Landecker children but still only a teenager, in 1941 had gone to work as a clerk in the accounting department of Benckiser​​​​​. The family doesn’t know when her romantic relationship with Reimann Jr. began, but the first of their three children was born in 1951.
Reimann Jr., who was married but never had children with his wife, fathered a total of nine children — including the three with Landecker — and adopted his offspring with Landecker in the 1960s. He also adopted the other children he fathered. Reimann died in 1984.
In the The New York Times story, Reimann family members said they had been told growing up that their parents met “at the company.” They knew their maternal grandfather had died in the Holocaust, but their mother rarely talked about the war years or her Jewish heritage. She worked at the company until 1965 and died in 2017 at age 94.
“I was born in 1956 and did not know the identity of my father until I was 10 years old,” Reimann-Ciardelli told the Valley News. “Because my father was much older and a very distant figure to me, I did not know the details of his wartime history until very recently. I grew up with my Mother and siblings, separate from my father.”
The Reimanns didn’t learn the full extent of their father’s collaboration with the Nazis until earlier this year, when JAB Holding released the findings of the investigation it commissioned, the family said.
Following disclosure of the main findings earlier this year, JAB Holding announced it was changing the name of the Reimann family foundation from Benckiser Stiftung Zukunft to the Alfred Landecker Foundation and “redirecting its purpose” to “raise awareness of the Holocaust and support and promote projects in research and education designed to uphold the memory of all the victims of the Nazis.”
“I was shocked and saddened when I learned the results of the family research earlier this year,” Reimann-Ciardelli said. “I am glad the information is public, and now that we know the full truth about my father and grandfather’s past, we are trying to make a positive difference for the future through the Alfred Landecker Foundation.”
Along with defining the foundation’s new direction and desire to “honor the memory of the victims of the Holocaust and of Nazi terror,” the Reimanns announced that they immediately would fund $11.3 million “to provide humanitarian assistance for survivors of the Holocaust and victims of forced labor in World War II” and further pledged to give another $277 million to the Berlin-based foundation over the next 10 years “which will become a rolling commitment in perpetuity.”
“We believe that a strong understanding of the destructive violence that made the unspeakable and historically unique Holocaust possible is critical to guaranteeing our democracies,” the Alfred Landecker Foundation says on its website. “All people should have the right to live without fear, persecution and suffering. We must combat prejudice and intolerance in all their many forms.”

Texto completo: The New York Times, which the year before had become the first mainstream newspaper to hire a full-time rock critic, initially sent just one reporter to cover the festival in August of 1969. As Arthur Gelb, then the metropolitan editor and the paper's culture czar, wrote decades later in his memoir, "City Room," he had expected Woodstock to be "just another big music festival," like the Newport jazz and folk festivals. When that reporter, Barnard L. Collier, got to Bethel, N.Y., on that Friday, he encountered enormous traffic jams as hundreds of thousands of people descended on Max Yasgur's farm. But it took a phone call from one of Gelb's younger reporters, Grace Lichtenstein, imploring him to send more people to cover the festival, saying "this story is much bigger than The Times thinks it is."
Gelb told William E. Farrell, the Albany bureau chief, that he could take a helicopter to get there. And he instructed Richard Reeves, then the paper's chief political correspondent, to stop following New York Mayor John V. Lindsay around as he wooed vacationing Jewish voters at a Catskills resort and join the others. The result was a six-story package on the Monday, anchored by one starting on the front page.

'Tired Rock Fans Begin Exodus'
Waves of weary youngsters streamed away from the Woodstock Music and Art Fair last night and early today as security officials reported at least two deaths and 4,000 people treated for injuries, illness and adverse drug reactions over the festival's three-day period.
However, festival officials said the folk and rock music festival could go on until dawn, and most of the crowd was determined to stay on.
As the music wailed on into the early morning hours, more than 100 campfires -- fed by fence-posts and any other wood the young people could lay their hands on -- flickered around the hillside that formed a natural amphitheater for the festival.
By midnight, nearly half of the 300,000 fans who camped here had left. A thunderstorm late yesterday afternoon provided the first big impetus to depart, and a steady stream continued to leave through the night.
Drugs and auto traffic continued to be the main headaches.
But the crowd itself was extremely well-behaved. As Dr. William Ambruzzi, the festival's chief medical officer, put it: "There has been no violence whatsoever, which is remarkable for a crowd of this size. These people are really beautiful.
______
The other articles, all crammed on to page 25, included a "Man in the News" profile of Max Yasgur, Reeves's piece about the festival's financial woes and another with the headline, "Bethel Pilgrims Smoke 'Grass' and Some Take LSD to 'Groove."' From nearby Monticello, Michael T. Kaufman wrote a piece about how the residents of the largest town in the area banded together to help "the sick, the hungry and the marooned." The description of the music, in a review by The Times's rock critic, Mike Jahn, was buried at the bottom of the page. His favorite performance belonged to Sly & the Family Stone.
The group, which is led by a former San Francisco disk jockey, Sylvester ("Sly") Stone, has artfully risen above the mass of soul bands by using melody styles vastly different from what is usual in soul music.
The best example of the group's sound fusion is "Everyday People," its song about brotherhood, which became one of the most popular records released this year. Sly and the Family Stone has managed to combine a happy-sounding melody line with an infectious and very danceable soul beat.
The crowd here responded many times more warmly than to any of the groups or individuals that appeared earlier."

'Morning After at Bethel'
On Tuesday, The Times editorial page weighed in. Shakespeare was quoted.
Now that Bethel has shrunk back to the dimensions of a Catskills village and most of the 300,000 young people who made it a "scene" have returned to their homes, the rock festival begins to take on the quality of a social phenomenon, comparable to the Tulipmania or the Children's Crusade. And in spite of the prevalence of drugs -- sales were made openly, and "you could get stoned just there breathing," a student gleefully reported -- it was essentially a phenomenon of innocence.
The music itself was surely a prime attraction. Where else could aficionados of rock expect to hear in one place Sly and the Family Stone, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Jefferson Airplane and those other lineal descendants of the primeval Beatles?
Yet it is hardly credible that they should have turned out in such vast numbers and endured, patiently and in good humor, the discomforts of mud, rain, hunger and thirst solely to hear bands they could hear on recordings in the comfort of home. They came, it seems, to enjoy their own society, free to exult in a life style that is its own declaration of independence. To such a purpose a little hardship could only be an added attraction.
***
Five thousand people were treated for injuries, illness and an excess of drugs. One hundred arrests were made on drug charges. And for three days traffic was tied in knots -- for most of the rebels against the consumers' society have cars.
By adult standards the occasion was clearly a disaster, an outrageous upset of all normal patterns. Yet the young people's conduct, in the end, earned them a salute from Monticello's police chief as "the most courteous, considerate and well-behaved group of kids he had ever dealt with.
Perhaps it was just the communal discomfort, that whiff of danger, that they needed to feel united and at peace. For comrades-in-rock, like comrades-in-arms, need great days to remember and embroider. With Henry the Fifth they could say at Bethel, "He that outlives this day, and comes safe home, will stand a tiptoe when this is nam'd."

'Woodstock: Like It Was in Words of Participants at Musical Fair'
A week after Woodstock ended, perhaps after recognizing that the original news coverage may have leaned a bit too much into the traffic jams, the mud and the drugs, and ignored what it was now calling "the most ambitious music festival ever held," The Times ran another front-page article. Gelb wrote that he had "the sense that something of considerable significance had taken place -- but what?" To unpack that significance, the paper assembled six attendees for a round-table conversation -- five men, one woman, ranging in age from 16 to 22. Gelb even joined the four reporters to conduct the interview, which lasted two and a half hours. The resulting piece came with a disclaimer:
"Because of the wishes of some of the parents -- or, in one case, because a participant was on probation for a drug offense -- the full names of the young people are withheld."
After the Woodstock attendees talked about why they went and their impressions of the scene -- Lindsey, "a 16-year-old junior at one of the city's better private schools," said the music drew her there and she was blown away by the atmosphere -- the conversation turned to drugs. And the paper performed some Times-splaining:
All the panel participants carried some kind of drug to the festival -- mostly marijuana (known as "grass" or "pot.") But there was also hashish (abbreviated as "hash"), barbiturates ("downs") and LSD (called "acid" after its chemical name, lysergic acid diethylamide).
On the way to Bethel, the participants worried about being searched by the police. Once concealed drugs in a hollowed-out arm rest of a car; another hid his on the floor, reading to ram it through a hole if a search began. A third said he was prepared to hide his in his underwear and demand that the officers produce a warrant made out in his name. None was searched.
Once they reached the festival their caution evaporated in the air made sweetish by thousands of burning "joints" (cigarettes hand-filled with marijuana). Anything they didn't bring seemed to be readily available, even heroin (called "skag") though none of the participants actually sought or saw any.
Not infrequently drugs were given away by young people eager to share. What couldn't be had free could be bought from dealers roaming freely through the crowd, or others who stayed back in the woods on what they took to calling "High Street."
Most of the participants regarded the drugs as an essential part of the scene -- like flags at a Fourth of July celebration.
What The Times called "conflicting themes of alienation and commitment" were woven throughout the conversation, as the other attendees, all from "comfortable middle-class backgrounds," weighed in.
Some of the young people had taken part in the political fervor that culminated in last year's Democratic convention in Chicago. Some had been in peace marches and campus protests. One of the boys had spent his Easter vacation rebuilding the run-down house of a poor black family. But there was also the temptation of living a life of comfort free from "too much responsibility."
Judy. There were so many people there, I thought, wow, wouldn't it be a good idea if we could show our power by, you know, getting political. And then I thought a little more about it and I said, oh, what for? It's already here. We already know it, we haven't got to bother.
Dan. I think it was apolitical, if anything. Chicago was very political. Woodstock was just like government and politics just didn't exist.
Jimmy. But although they didn't exist up there in Woodstock, people were very aware. Like whenever Joan Baez said anything about, you know, about the laws that do exist, whether they were being put into effect at Woodstock or not, the fact that they do exist was not forgotten by anybody.
Bill. Oh yes. There was evidence of outside politics. I mean you saw the Army and you thought of Vietnam and things like that. I mean when I saw the helicopters landing and picking up the wounded, it reminded me of Vietnam.

'Mike Lang (groovy kid from Brooklyn) plus John Roberts (unlimited capital) equals Woodstock'
Several weeks later, Mr. Reeves, who would go on to write critically acclaimed books about John F. Kennedy and Richard M. Nixon, delivered a lengthy piece for the Sunday magazine that evoked the New Journalism then revolutionizing magazine writing. He used his incredible behind-the-scenes access at the festival to capture the frayed relationship among the organizers, as Woodstock Ventures careened toward $ 1.3 million in debt.
Here comes Mike Lang! He's rolling along the New Jersey Turnpike in a U-Haul truck filled with a few thousand psychedelic posters and other salable stuff. The kid from Brooklyn is coming home from Florida, 23 years old, curly brown hair down to his shoulders, Indian vest and dungarees. Groovy! February, 1968. Look out, New York! Look out, America." Look out, John Roberts!
There's John Roberts in his apartment on East 85th Street. Same age as Mike, horn-rimmed glasses, Rogers Peet suit. At 25 he'll inherit the first million dollars from the Polident trust fund. Outasight! A year ago he and a friend put that advertisement in The New York Times: "Young men with unlimited capital looking for interesting and legitimate business enterprises."
Beautiful! There were 1,400 replies, including one from the man with the flying car and another from the lady with a formula for watermelon-flavored Popsicles.
Mike and John were meant for each other, poet and patron. Sorry, Popsicle lovers, but Mike got most of that unlimited capital. He had an idea, the greatest happening in history -- The Woodstock Music and Art Fair.
"I knew it was going to happen," Mike said the other day as his white Porsche stopped in front of the Plaza. "Even before I found his money, I knew it was going down. I have this sense of time."
"Mike's from another planet," said the lank redhead with him as men stopped to watch her climb up out of the little car. "He has these two bumps on his head, like horns. And funny leprechaun ears and eyes that slant up."

'Woodstock Festival Costs Bethel Official His Post'
Woodstock has continued to reverberate throughout the ensuing decades, as the event took on almost mythic qualities. But there were some more down-to-earth, and much more local, repercussions, soon after the festival, as this Associated Press article in The Times made clear.
The Democratic Supervisor of the Town of Bethel lost a re-election bid by eight votes yesterday after a campaign with one issue -- the massive rock festival last summer.
Daniel Amatucci has permitted the Woodstock Music and Art Festival to be held in Bethel. About 300,000 young people descended on the tiny Catskill Mountain community.
Mr. Amatucci lost 598-590.

Texto completo: Virginia Giuffre's husband woke her early in Australia, where it was Sunday morning, to share a stunning development that would leave her in tears: Jeffrey Epstein was dead.
Ms. Giuffre, who has long accused Mr. Epstein of sexually abusing her, said the news of his suicide triggered a complicated mix of emotions. She was grateful that Mr. Epstein would never harm anyone again, but she said she was mostly angry that after so many years of struggle to bring attention to Mr. Epstein, there would be no chance to see him answer for his conduct.
"We've worked so hard to get here, and he stole that from us, too," Ms. Giuffre said in an interview with The New York Times.
[Read more about Mr. Epstein's suicide in a Manhattan federal jail. ]
Mr. Epstein's suicide in a Manhattan federal jail on Saturday left accusers around the globe shocked and angered that they would never see him face a full reckoning for his exploits. After years of setbacks, they said they had come so close, with Mr. Epstein behind bars and a reinvigorated prosecution eager to air allegations of sexual abuse that had long been obscured.
"Jeffrey Epstein took himself out because he was too much of a coward to face justice and his accusers," said Alicia Arden, a model who filed a police report against Mr. Epstein in 1997 that accused him of sexually assaulting her after purporting to be a talent scout for Victoria's Secret.
Jennifer Araoz, who said she had been raped by Mr. Epstein after being recruited outside her Manhattan high school in 2001, said she was angry he would not have to face anyone in court.
"We have to live with the scars of his actions for the rest of our lives, while he will never face the consequences of the crimes he committed, the pain and trauma he caused so many people," Ms. Araoz said in a statement.
Several accusers, some speaking through lawyers, said they hoped that authorities would continue their investigation, focusing on other people in Mr. Epstein's circle who they said had helped recruit, train and coerce his victims.
Federal prosecutors have indicated they are looking beyond Mr. Epstein. Federal charges filed against him last month included a charge of conspiracy.
"Jeffrey Epstein did not act, and could not have done what he did, alone," said David Boies, a New York attorney representing Ms. Giuffre and other accusers. "Justice demands that those who acted with him also be held accountable."
In the hours after Mr. Epstein, 66, was found lifeless in his cell, Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States attorney in Manhattan, said his office would continue to investigate.
"To those brave young women who have already come forward and to the many others who have yet to do so, let me reiterate that we remain committed to standing for you," Mr. Berman said in a statement.
Mr. Epstein's suicide came a day after a federal appeals court released a cache of previously sealed documents, including depositions that revealed disturbing details about Mr. Epstein's conduct. Ms. Giuffre said in depositions contained in the documents that she had been kept as a "sex slave" with the assistance of Ghislaine Maxwell, Mr. Epstein's longtime confidante.
Ms. Maxwell, in another deposition in the case, called Ms. Giuffre's accusations "an absolute lie." Her lawyers could not be reached for comment on Saturday. A day earlier, their office had said they were out of the country and unavailable to comment.
Ms. Giuffre said in the interview that she'd like to see people continue pushing the Justice Department to hold Mr. Epstein's allies accountable.
The new documents and details emerging in the case have raised extensive questions about the scope of Mr. Epstein's network -- which appears to have spanned from New York to New Mexico to the Caribbean -- as well as the number of victimized girls and the help he received from loyal companions.
Michelle Licata, who has accused Mr. Epstein of assaulting her when she was 16, said in text messages that she wasn't so much angry, but she was disappointed in not having a chance to confront him. She said she never wanted him to die.
"I just wanted him to be held accountable for his actions," Ms. Licata said.
Robbie Kaplan, an attorney representing an accuser who was a minor at the time of the conduct and was included in the federal indictment, said she "will continue to fight tirelessly on their behalf not only to seek justice, but also to ensure that all of the facts of his monstrous crimes become known to the world."
Sigrid McCawley, another attorney working with Ms. Giuffre and other women, said, "The victims await the true justice they have sought and deserve."
A range of accusers had previously worked with Florida investigators who had been building a case against Mr. Epstein more than a decade ago amid allegations that girls were recruited to give Mr. Epstein massages that led to assaults.
He avoided federal charges from that case thanks to a plea agreement in 2008 that allowed him to admit to state charges of solicitation of prostitution from a minor. He served 13 months in jail but was allowed to leave the jail for 12 hours a day, six days a week, to work at his office in Florida.
Mr. Epstein's case resurged in recent months after a Miami Herald investigation last year further examined that plea agreement.
Mr. Epstein was arrested last month at Teterboro Airport and charged by Manhattan federal prosecutors with sex trafficking of girls as young as 14, renewing hope among his accusers that he would face overdue accountability.
Jack Scarola, a Florida attorney who represents additional women, said the victims that he knows regretted that they might not get answers and that the chance to hold Mr. Epstein responsible may have died with him.
"My primary reaction is that Jeffrey Epstein's victims have been once again failed by the justice system and cheated out of an opportunity for justice," he said.
Mr. Scarola said he was stunned that Mr. Epstein had not been on suicide watch, given both his high profile and that prison officials suspected he had attempted to kill himself last month. Mr. Epstein had been placed on suicide watch after he was found injured in his cell on July 23, but he was taken off six days later, according to an official familiar with his detention.
Authorities did not immediately explain why he was taken off suicide watch. The F.B.I. said it was investigating, and Attorney General William P. Barr said in a statement that a special inquiry would be opened into what had happened.
"I was appalled to learn that Jeffrey Epstein was found dead early this morning from an apparent suicide while in federal custody," Mr. Barr said.
Spencer Kuvin, another attorney, said one of his clients was feeling some sense of closure that the person who had wronged her was gone forever. But she was also frustrated that he would not answer for his crimes in court, Mr. Kuvin said.
"I think that she's in shock," Mr. Kuvin said.
Emily Steel and Frances Robles contributed reporting.

Trying to Understand Bill de Blasio

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
One morning in May, Bill de Blasio and I were sitting on the porch of Gracie Mansion, jousting civilly through a 70-minute interview at the fusty-but-regal mayoral residence abutting the East River, when we arrived at a point of agreement: Many New Yorkers do not seem to understand him very well.
"We have a very strong mayor system here -- tremendous amount of decision-making concentrated right here, one person," he said, gesturing at himself. "And understanding how that person really ticks, as opposed to the superficialities -- I don't feel like there's been a lot of that."
And that was why I had gone to see him. My piece in this weekend's New York Times Magazine takes a long look at the mayor, his city and how the two feel about each other after a tumultuous term and a half. Six years after supporters hailed him as New York's great progressive hope, Mr. de Blasio has appeared to find higher purpose in extracurricular political pursuits, including his current long-shot presidential run. He seems to have grown weary of his workaday headaches: the activists he has disappointed; the governor who persists in tormenting him; the unrelenting press corps.
At the beginning of his tenure, the mayor and I spent our days at the same address -- he in an airy City Hall office, behind a desk once used by Fiorello La Guardia; I among the pen-and-pad set in an overstuffed press room across the building.
I left City Hall in 2015 to cover national politics. The mayor still has his office, though he hasn't shown up much lately.
Politicians are generally more complicated than they appear -- some heady cocktail of ambition, altruism, insecurity, masochism -- and Mr. de Blasio can sustain more contradictions than most. He won what appeared to be his dream job and then seemed quickly disenchanted with it. He is running for president in the hopes that a national audience will be more hospitable than much of his own city. He has governed as a self-styled crusading liberal at a moment of generally positive economic and public safety trends, with Democratic resistance to President Trump simmering across the city, while becoming a frequent punch line for reasons his critics often strain to articulate.
Several months ago, we set out to explore these tensions and answer the question that national political operatives have privately been asking me, a supposed de Blasiologist, for years: "What's his deal?"
For a piece of this scope, that meant a lot of meetings and phone calls -- with current and former aides, with allies and rivals from across his career, with advocates and constituents holding him to account. Many of these dozens of conversations, conducted since the spring, never made it into print in the form of an interview with direct quotes. Yet, almost all of them were helpful, both in advancing our understanding of the subject and in providing information that could be confirmed later with other sources.
Then there was the mayor himself. There can be a strange imbalance in covering politicians for an extended period. You spend so much of your day thinking about them, talking about them, obsessing over their tics -- Was that a new line in the stump speech? What's his angle? Did he get a haircut? -- often coming to know them far better than they know you. (This is not to say that they don't try. Years ago, I was startled when the mayor called me "Fleg" at a news conference, perhaps picking up on my sometimes-nickname used by his aides and other reporters.)
But what distinguishes Mr. de Blasio is how wounded he can sound when reporters, or the general public, do not understand him as he wants to be understood.
In our interview, he raised the matter of the morning routine that has earned him consistent flogging in the press: being driven from the mansion in Manhattan to his old Brooklyn haunts, some 40 minutes by SUV, to get coffee and exercise among former neighbors. "It is my North Star," he said, "to be reminded of something very human, very local, very grass-roots and to not feel I'm different."
He talked about the mental health benefits of the arrangement, given the singular stresses of the mayoralty. "There's a certain finite number of leadership jobs in America that take a total commitment of energy," he said.
I said this sounded like a pretty good argument against a presidential campaign for a sitting mayor. That was when we stopped agreeing.

Texto completo: "Wellness" is a word that has come to encompass our latest dominant sociocultural obsession -- how to take care of ourselves in the world. It may, at one point, have been popularly understood as an extension of self-help, a category of literature and speaker circuits that is devoted to personal optimization (and often, productivity). But more recently, under the potent influence of millennial values, wellness has been positioned and marketed as self-care. This wellness is softer, gentler, more forgiving than its self-flagellating forebear. Definitely more fun.
Maybe the new wellness is -- to borrow from the Democratic primary candidate and self-help author Marianne Williamson -- a return to "love," instead of fear?
Self-care is often critically characterized as a market for purchasable experiences like massages, manicures and "me time." But its origins are in a series of loose, secular rituals meant to calm the nervous system, and are informed in part by the work of feminist writers of color, including Audre Lorde and bell hooks, both of whom wrote about caring for one's self in oppressive conditions. In "A Burst of Light," Lorde writes, "Caring for myself is not self-indulgence, it is self-preservation, and that is an act of political warfare."
Of course, the concept has been simplified, and broadened to mean any number of things.
On Instagram, the axis of millennial life, there are about two million posts tagged #selfhelp, while there are around 18 million for #selfcare. Those form a soft-focus sea of cups of tea, journals, hand-drawn quotations, bed-nests of blankets, books, cats and snacks -- basically, anything that might make someone feel good. It's far removed from the self-help-style wellness that emphasizes labor and self-denial: punishing exercise classes, cleanses, detoxes and restrictive diets. That all might feel increasingly irrelevant in the context of the low-wage, ultra-precarious and generally diminished economic circumstances that millennials have found themselves in, and in the context of the anxieties of this era. The self of established, self-improving, self-help seeks to conquer. The self of the newer, kinder, weirder self-care seeks nourishment instead.
The Literature
If self-help is about fixing something, self-care thinks you're already great. So much of current, trendy self-help dovetails with business management and entrepreneurialism, and a lot of the rest of it feels like it's from another psychological era: It might be temporarily comforting, and even galvanizing, to engage in "The Subtle Art of Not Giving a ____ or to practice "The Life-Changing Magic of Not Giving a ____" or to "Un____ Yourself." Before this era of tongue-in-cheek titles, self-help sought to categorize and instruct, as seen in best-selling titles like the heteronormalizing "Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus"; the productivity mandating "The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People"; the personality corrective "How to Win Friends and Influence People"; and the law-of-attraction guide "The Secret."
But the self-consciously edgy formulas, and the even-cornier, prescriptive, top-down self-help books that engendered them, don't necessarily wonder. They skip over the energy of empathy, warmth, tenderness and inclusion that is the best stuff of the millennial imagination.
If self-help is about how to do, self-care is about how to not do. Self-care, though, has no organizing rules, slogans or major, best-selling books -- yet. Jenny Odell's newish book, "How to Do Nothing: Resisting the Attention Economy," and adrienne maree brown's "Pleasure Activism" espouse some of self-care's feel-good ideologies (as do the seemingly infinite journal-ish workbooks and coloring books on the market), but the literature of self-care-informed wellness lives much more iteratively and personally on Instagram, in (frequently misspelled and misattributed) inspirational quotations and super-long captions, and on lingering blogs.
And yes, much of the wellness content of the internet is performative, metaphorical or gestural. The small daily efforts of self-care -- establishing boundaries, going to the doctor, taking three conscious breaths and just doing less -- aren't that clickable.
There is a self-help/self-care Venn diagram, however, and the overlapping section could be categorized as "spiritual self-help," a classification that describes the work of Ms. Williamson, as well as popular authors like Julia Cameron (whose creativity manual "The Artist's Way" is one of the most enduring books in the broader self-help genre, its purpose and style seemingly invulnerable to social and cultural shifts), Eckhart Tolle, Gabrielle Bernstein and Danielle LaPorte. Spiritual self-help seeks less often to fix, and more often, to understand, and to soothe and calm like self-care.
At the intersection of spiritual self-help and self-care is the reason for them: the pursuit of something deeper, something more elemental
The Leaders and Vendors
The authorities of a self-help-informed kind of wellness, who sell a specific program to live by and complain about, include exercise alphas like Jillian Michaels, Billy Blanks or any of the locally worshiped spinning or CrossFit instructors, as well as diet gurus like Melissa Hartwig of the Whole30 (so many rules!) and Dr. Alejandro Junger, of the Clean program.
The original and maybe only self-care star is Audre Lorde, whose conceptualization of self-care as a form of protest is the most critical.
Gwyneth Paltrow is a kind-of Gen X corporate wellness avatar -- the Oz of an industry that confidently depends on women trying to mitigate their various anxieties. Her Goop empire sells self-care products, often at exclusive price points.
But other wellness entrepreneurs serve the kinds of seekers who want spirituality and connection and self-awareness along with, say, great skin. These include Amanda Chantal Bacon of Moon Juice, a nu-groovy operation that specializes in juices and adaptogenic "dusts"; Erica Chidi Cohen, a co-founder of LOOM in Los Angeles, which offers support around sexual and reproductive health and parenting; Ty Haney, the founder of Outdoor Voices, the Austin, Tex.-based "you-do-you" apparel brand; and Liz Tran, who founded Reset, a new wellness space, or "sanctuary," in Manhattan that offers classes and workshops in the "formation of the integrated self," with corporate career coaching, sound baths and astrology. (The space could be a sign of what's next: Instead of millennial pinks and modernist clutter, here are jewel tones, warm wood and an 800-pound smoky quartz crystal from Madagascar.)
Authority vs. the Me-Archy
Many of the newer wellness products are direct-to-consumer. The individualization of self-care wellness includes custom vitamins from subscription services, like Ritual and Care/of, as well as curated boxes filled with candles, jade rollers and succulents.
Wellness might currently be code for "thin," according to Jessica Knoll writing in The New York Times, but it's also a superstructure for those who feel ignored or condescended to by Western medicine. While self-help-styled wellness involved a top-down, rules-based wellness orthodoxy -- which does, of course, work for many women -- newer, self-care-specific wellness is an easy sell for women on a heroine's journey with their bodies and feelings, through sun signs, human design, snail-mucus face masks or blunts. Whatever works.
The Marketing
While self-help-oriented wellness products were straight out of the health-food store with utilitarian or medicinal packaging, the aesthetic of self-care wellness branding is often minimalist, sans-serif and streamlined. A good example is the packaging of the brand Dosist, which sells pens with precise doses of CBD and THC. The company pitches itself as health-adjacent, like many other savvy cannabis brands that are attempting to appeal to a new market with a clean, high-tone look and feel.
Dosist just opened a second brick-and-mortar location in L.A. to create "wellness experiences" (with the help of a "wellness concierge"), joining Saks, Neiman Marcus and the now-bankrupt Barneys New York, all of which have capitalized on the potential of luxe wellness, the natural extension of the self-care wellness model.
Many self-care-oriented wellness products, including those from CAP Beauty, Tulura, Golde, Tata Harper and Tatcha, look like a new kind of high-end beauty product. Others channel happy, kiddo vibes (see: Kopari Beauty, Supergoop, Moon Juice and Drunk Elephant). Those could respond to another feeling many who respond to self-care are seeking: a childlike lightness that momentarily distracts from the grown-up problems of the every day.

Texto completo: The hundreds of thousands of Americans descending on Paris during this year's tourist season are in for a shock: The city's waiters, bakers and taxi drivers -- and practically anyone else they encounter -- will mostly speak to them in eager, serviceable and occasionally even near-perfect English.
It's not just France. In recent years the number of Europeans who speak English -- and speak it well -- has soared. The EF English Proficiency Index, whose online test rates adults around the world, has found annual gains since it began in 2011. Of the 27 countries it ranks as highly or very highly proficient, 22 are in Europe. The French are still among Europe's worst English speakers, but they are desperate to improve.
English has been Europe's lingua franca since World War II, of course. But younger people in particular, from Stockholm to Slovenia, increasingly speak a nuanced English that can rival native speech. And it's only getting better: About 80 percent of primary school students on the Continent study it (up from about 60 percent in 2004), and 94 percent of high school students take English, far more than all other foreign languages combined.
Europeans have long watched English-language TV shows and movies, but in bigger countries like Germany and France these were usually dubbed. Now, they all binge-watch Netflix in subtitled English, a virtual English-immersion course. (One French podcaster recommended American sitcoms, with recurring phrases like "Are you breaking up with me?")
Never mind Brexit; earlier this year the Netherlands opened an all-English commercial court. Gone, it seems, are the regional conferences conducted in "Globish" -- the stilted, simplified version of English that used to be the norm. At the Paris co-working space where I rent a desk, my 20-something neighbors -- a Colombian, a German, an Italian and a Frenchman -- converse in nearly flawless English, a scene replicated in Copenhagen, Berlin and many other cities.
All this sounds like good news for native English speakers, but it may also be a threat. What does it mean for Brits and Americans when everyone from Dutch teenagers to Romanian hackers has mastered our mother tongue?
Universities in the United States should watch out. It won't be long before Americans realize that top European schools offer a fast-growing number of bachelor's and master's degrees, taught entirely in English, for a fraction of the price of many American schools, even if you add on overseas airfare. (In 2009, there were about 55 English B.A.'s offered in Continental Europe; by 2017, there were 2,900.)
Worldwide university rankings lay bare the choices: At Belgium's KU Leuven, ranked 48 in the world, students from outside the European Union pay 1,750 euros per year for a B.A. in business taught in English. At the University of Amsterdam, ranked 62, non-European Union students pay 9,300 euros per year for a B.A. in political science. America's and Britain's most elite schools still top the global rankings, but after that it's harder to justify the cost.
We're a target. When the world speaks excellent English, English-speaking societies become easier to decode and manipulate. Before the 2016 American elections, the Kremlin recruited young Russians whose written English was so good that they mostly passed for Americans on social media.
But good ideas can spread faster, too. Scientific papers have long been published mostly in English; now social movements are Anglophone. This spring, a 16-year-old English-speaking Swede inspired kids around the world to protest climate change. (From Lisbon to Istanbul, their homemade signs were in English.)
Native English may cease to be the gold standard. Most people now learn English to communicate with other nonnative speakers -- and even many of their teachers aren't native -- so they acquire few expressions and idioms. The linguist Jennifer Jenkins describes a British TV interviewer asking a perplexed Italian opera singer whether his trip to England is "going swimmingly." She writes that, at European Union conferences, nonnatives who can easily understand each other's English switch on their translation headphones when someone from Britain or Ireland takes the stage.
English will mutate. A recent Irish conference on "World Englishes" included sessions on "Egyptian English as a new English variety" and "English in the linguistic landscape of Kazakhstan." The linguist Marianne Hundt of the University of Zurich says common errors like "we need to discuss about this" or "I want some advices" could enter native speech.
Natives are losing their competitive edge. A few jobs still require perfect English, but in the corporate world good English has become a basic requirement, not a personal selling point. "You just have the same skill as other people -- it's like using Excel," says Kate Bell, of the EF English Proficiency Index.
Crucially, the ubiquity of English lulls us Anglophones into thinking that it's O.K. to be monolingual. It's not. I've been at Amsterdam dinners where everyone is speaking brilliant English, but the minute I leave the table they switch back to Dutch. If all we know is English, we won't know what the rest of the world is saying about us.

End of debate: A hot dog is a sandwich

Texto completo: The hot dog is a classic American symbol. Its name evokes memories of baseball games, summer barbecues, and the notorious Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest.
Whatever one associates with the simple comfort food, one thing is certain: A hot dog is and should be considered a sandwich. It is necessary to look at both history and economics to understand why the debate over hot dog categorization is a tragic illustration of governmental manipulation.
First, let’s look at the food’s history.
When the hot dog was first created in the late 1800s, it was referred to as a “Coney Island Sandwich” or “Frankfurter sandwich.” Additionally, the first entry under “sandwich” in the Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines “sandwich” as “two or more slices of bread or a split roll having a filling in between."
Along the same lines, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has always defined sandwiches as "consisting of two slices of bread or the top and bottom sections of a sliced bun that enclose meat or poultry."
Following these definitions as well as its original name, it is undeniable that a hot dog is a sandwich. It is a split roll with a filling (the sausage) in between.
New York Times food editor Sam Sifton succumbed to a contradiction: “A hot dog is not a sandwich. A lobster roll is a sandwich.” If one were to follow Sifton’s logic, any sub, hero, or hoagie would also be disqualified as a sandwich because it is one split roll, instead of two pieces of bread. So, the next time you go to Subway, you’re supposed to believe that the products they sell are not actually sandwiches.
Next, it’s economically prudent to call a hot dog a “sandwich” because it’ll save you money.
In 1971, the state of New York passed a law which imposed a state and city sales tax to restaurant bills that totaled more than a dime and less than a dollar. The price range earned the tax moniker “hot dog tax” because it boosted the tax on lunches, namely the most popular lunch item — the hot dog.
A Citizens Committee to Repeal the Hot Dog Tax was formed to urge the governor to ditch the tax because it directly targeted poor people who relied on low-priced hot dogs for sustenance. Other states have tragically followed suit on the tyrannical sausage tax: In Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, California, and South Carolina, just to name a few, hot dogs are taxable if served hot (basically from a cart in the form of a sandwich in a bun), but not taxed when sold packaged in stores.
Essentially, states purposely classified hot dogs as non-sandwiches in the mid-20th century with the express purpose of imposing sales taxes and extracting more money for the government. But a hot dog is and has historically always been a sandwich, despite what tax the government may deceive you into paying.
This debate may seem trivial, but it exemplifies how the government manipulates consumer interests to reap the largest possible profit for itself. The best way to keep your hard-earned money in your pockets is to fight against the coercion of unfair sales taxes, deregulate the meat market, and redeem hot dogs for what they were created to be — sandwiches.

Despite warning signs, why wasn't Jeffrey Epstein on suicide watch when he died?

Texto completo: Less than three weeks ago, Jeffrey Epstein was placed on suicide watch after he was found in his New York jail cell with injuries to his neck.
But the wealthy financier had already been removed from constant surveillance when he was found unresponsive in his jail cell early Saturday morning. He was rushed to a hospital and pronounced dead after an apparent suicide by hanging.
Epstein, 66, was removed from suicide watch on July 29, just six days after the self-inflicted bruising on his neck was spotted, according to the New York Times. It meant that he was returned to the special housing unit at the jail, which is separated from the rest of the facility and has extra security.
The Federal Bureau of Prisons did not respond to a message from USA TODAY asking why Epstein was taken off suicide watch. His death, which followed the July 23 warning signs, has raised questions about whether the Metropolitan Correctional Center followed proper procedures to ensure Epstein didn't kill himself.
"The decision to remove him appears to have been a colossal error that must be thoroughly probed," Harry Litman, former U. S. attorney and deputy assistant attorney general, wrote in a stinging column in the Washington Post. He also questioned why Epstein was given access to the tools needed for suicide.
How Epstein died: Disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, awaiting sex trafficking charges, dead of apparent suicide
Federal jails and prisons are required to house at least one room for inmates on suicide watch with staff taking shifts to ensure the individual is under "constant observation. " That typically means having someone watching inmates 24 hours a day.
Observers must document behavior, under federal law, and inmates can only be removed from suicide watch when they are determined to be "no longer at imminent risk for suicide" or in need of medical attention.
Who decides when inmates are taken off suicide watch?
Mental health professionals determine whether someone is placed on suicide watch, said Jeff Eiser, a corrections expert with 30 years of experience operating prisons and jails in Ohio. He said a mental health expert would decide the level of care following evaluations and determine when someone is fit to be removed.
Lisa Boesky, a clinical psychologist and jail suicide expert from San Diego, said that if Epstein was no longer on suicide watch, it likely meant he was cleared by a licensed mental health professional.
“When removing such a high risk individual from suicide watch it would be critical to do it in a step-down fashion so that there is still some extra monitoring on the high-risk individual. ”
But Boesky said Epstein was still "a high risk for suicide" because of the nature of his crimes, the humiliation he is experiencing and the recent reported suicide attempt. "This would increase his risk for suicide significantly. ”
Inmates can fake improvement
Christine Tartaro, a criminal justice professor at Stockton University in New Jersey, said it’s not totally uncommon for an inmate to be removed from suicide watch after six days.
“The length varies by individual,” Tartaro said. One person might have a fleeting moment of suicidality but then stabilize and accept their situation, whereas another might be in the depths of a depression that requires monitoring for much longer.
Experts say it's also possible Epstein pretended to be doing better to get out of suicide watch.
“Not everyone is honest with the corrections staff," Tartaro said. "If they really want to kill themselves they might say that they are fine, to act fine, to not draw attention to themselves. So there is that possibility here. The other possibility is that he was showing signs and really not doing well. ”
Epstein’s celebrity status, and the crimes which he was accused of, likely have warranted some extra supervision in general, Tartaro said.
“Those who harm children are at the bottom rung and are seen as being acceptable targets for violence,” Tartaro said.
Epstein shared a cell with Nicholas Tartaglione, a former police officer facing murder charges. Tartaglione's attorney last month denied that his client was responsible for Epstein's injuries.

Suicide watch isn't foolproof
Although around-the-clock monitoring can decrease the chance of inmates killing themselves, Eiser said suicides in prisons are hard to prevent.
"One thing in the jail business unfortunately is if somebody wants to hurt themselves at some point, unless you have constant eyes on them, it's almost impossible to prevent," Eiser said.
"To point fingers now at anybody would be premature I think," he said, adding that the case needs to first be investigated to identify the facts.
Epstein's death came within 24 hours after long-sealed documents were released by a federal court in a since-settled lawsuit against Epstein’s ex-girlfriend by Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein’s accusers. The documents included depositions of years of alleged sex acts involving underage girls.
It was unclear before Epstein's death whether federal prosecutors were pursuing a superseding indictment that would include additional charges and defendants beyond Epstein. Epstein was know for his high-profile connections, including Bill Clinton, Donald Trump and Prince Andrew.
Questions from Congress: 'We need answers. Lots of them. ': Congress calls for investigations after Jeffrey Epstein's death
U. S. Attorney General William Barr said the Department of Justice Inspector General would open an investigation in addition to the FBI investigation.
“Mr. Epstein’s death raises serious questions that must be answered," Barr said.
What is suicide watch?
According to the U. S. Justice Department, suicide is the leading cause of death in jails.
Suicide watch is a more “punitive management of an inmate,” said Lindsay Hayes, an expert on inmate suicide and prevention and a project director for the National Center on Institutions and Alternatives. It typically includes being locked in a cell without contact with other inmates, being served only finger foods, and being required to wear a “safety smock” instead of regular jail clothing, he said.
The smock is usually heavy, quilted fabric that’s difficult to tie together or tear into strips that could be used for an attempted asphyxiation or hanging.
“Being on suicide watch is probably even worse than being harassed by other inmates,” said Hayes, who added that jail and prison inmates often try to get reclassified at a lower level of monitoring at the earliest opportunity.
For that reason, it can be “hard for a clinician to determine if the person is suicidal or not,” or simply wants to return to less restrictive treatment within a jail or prison, said Hayes.
He said federal officials should conduct a rigorous and transparent investigation of the suspected suicide by Epstein, whom he characterized as “probably the most high-profile inmate right now” in the federal correctional system.
“If there was any wrongdoing, people should be held accountable,” said Hayes.

Texto completo: Senator Elizabeth Warren outlined a series of measures Saturday with an ambitious goal of slashing rates of gun deaths by 80 percent, pitching her ideas for firearms licensing, an assault weapons ban and other major changes ahead of a gun safety event in Iowa that follows mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton, Ohio.
Warren pledged to enact many of her proposals — a combination of executive actions and legislation — within the first 100 days of her presidency if elected, she wrote in a Medium post.
Acknowledging her 80 percent goal as daunting, Warren likened it to the dramatic drop in automobile fatalities after the number of deaths from car accidents reached frightening heights in the 1960s.
“We might not know how to get all the way there yet," Warren wrote. “But we'll start by implementing solutions that we believe will work. We'll continue by constantly revisiting and updating those solutions based on new public health research. And we'll make structural changes to end the ability of corrupt extremists to block our government from defending the lives of our people."
Warren has become known for setting the tone on policy for the 2020 Democratic primary field with detailed policy proposals unveiled almost weekly. But she had yet to release a gun control plan when mass shootings unfolded over a matter of hours last weekend, killing 31 people. Some of Warren's campaign rivals, including California Senator Kamala Harris and New Jersey Senator Cory Booker, released gun control proposals several months ago, and two others, Washington Governor Jay Inslee and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, did so on Tuesday.
On Sunday, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders called for a ban on making, selling, and transferring assault weapons and program for the government to buy those weapons from Americans; the following day, in a CNN interview, former vice president Joe Biden also endorsed a national buyback program.
In her plan, Warren said she'd propose legislation banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, requiring a federal license to purchase firearms or ammunition, implementing universal background checks, and significantly hiking taxes on gun manufacturers — to as high as 50 percent on ammunition.
She would set a nationwide one-week waiting period to buy guns, and cap the number of guns that can be purchased per month at one. Her legislation would also raise the minimum age to buy any type of gun to 21 and strengthen meaures to combat so-called straw purchases involving a person buying a gun on behalf of someone who is prohibited from buying it.
Warren's plan endorses “red flag" laws that allow guns to be seized from individuals deemed dangerous to themselves or others. She also proposed extending restrictions of firearms sales to those convicted of hate crimes, stalking, or who have restraining orders.
“Any individual convicted of a hate crime should be permanently prohibited from owning a gun, full stop," Warren wrote.
Other legislative measures in her proposal would repeal existing laws. Under Warren's plan, gun manufacturers and sellers could be sued when their weapons are used to commit a crime, repealing a 2005 law that prohibited such suits. And Warren would urge Congress to repeal another law that exempts guns from federal product safety regulations.
Beyond legislation, the Cambridge Democrat said that if elected, she would implement executive orders to close federal background check loopholes, expand gun sale reporting requirements, and extend minimum age requirements to more types of sales. Warren would also crack down on illegal gun trafficking across state and federal borders as well as on gun dealers that don't follow the law.
And Warren said she'd repeal a flurry of executive orders loosening gun restrictions enacted by President Trump as well as appoint an attorney general committed to investigating the National Rifle Association for alleged illegal business practices.

Emmy Awards will go on without a host

Texto completo: Another awards show this year will go on without a host at the helm - this time, on television's biggest night.
No one will lead the Emmys at the presentation Sept. 22, Charlie Collier, chief executive of Fox Entertainment, announced Wednesday.
The Academy Awards also went hostless earlier this year after homophobic tweets surfaced from the ceremony's host of choice, comedian Kevin Hart, and he stepped down.
Collier said the change would allow more time in the program to pay tribute to shows that ended this year, The Associated Press reported. Several long-running - and heavily decorated - series such as "Game of Thrones" and "Veep" recently concluded their final seasons.
The Emmy broadcast rotates among the networks from year to year. When it runs on ABC, CBS or NBC, a comedian from a late-night show typically takes the reins. Last year's ceremony on NBC was led by Michael Che and Colin Jost, who anchor the "Weekend Update" segment on NBC's "Saturday Night Live."
Fox has no late-night lineup. When the network last broadcast the Emmys, in 2015, Andy Samberg from "Brooklyn Nine-Nine" - then airing on Fox - hosted. NBC picked up the police sitcom when Fox canceled it last year.
The Emmys have aired without a host several times, most recently in 2003, when the show was also broadcast by Fox.
This year's Emmy nominations were dominated by HBO's "Game of Thrones," with 32, the highest number for any show in a single year. HBO rang up a record 137 nominations - far more than Netflix or its other competitors - with nods also going to "Veep," "Succession" and "Sharp Objects," among others.

A quandary for Never Trumpers

Texto completo: The Democratic debates have been hard on Never Trumpers. The small but vocal group of Republicans and former Republicans who oppose President Donald Trump has watched in horror as Democrats veered leftward, embracing "Medicare for All," virtually open borders, sky-high taxes and other positions no conservative could ever accept.
The Never Trumpers see disaster coming in the form of the president winning re-election over a Democrat who moved too far left for the American voter.
So they issue warnings. The Democrats’ performance in the most recent debate was "worse than farcical," The New York Times’ Bret Stephens wrote. "It’s tragic. It will make the Trump campaign’s job of selling the president as the non-insane option in next year’s election shamefully easy."
Bill Kristol, the former Dan Quayle aide who founded the now-shuttered Weekly Standard, tweeted, "Best moment in this debate: ‘It’s time for closing statements.’" After the first debate — a widely watched event that gave voters across the nation their initial impression of the Democratic field — some Never Trumpers were deeply alarmed.
"Trump wants to portray Democrats as open-border socialists," wrote The Washington Post’s Max Boot. "And in their eagerness to court progressive primary voters, the candidates are playing into his hands."
The fretting and complaining, coming from people who had been Republicans until Trump came along, set some liberals on edge.
"I, for one, have pretty much had it with the chorus of center-right voices braying that the Democrats are heading for certain doom ... if the party picks a nominee who actually embraces the party’s ideals," wrote the Post’s Eugene Robinson, adding that "Never Trump Republicans and independents may be shocked to hear this, but the Democratic Party is likely to nominate a Democrat for president."
The pushback served to highlight the Never Trump dilemma. First, they went through a torturous process searching for a candidate to support in the 2016 election. Now, it’s happening again.
The 2020 problem is twofold. The first part is that there is no hope of challenging Trump within the Republican Party structure. As sitting president, Trump controls the Republican National Committee and has the support of the vast majority of GOP voters.
The second part is the depressingly woke Democratic field. Only a few Never Trumpers would be able to support a Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren or Kamala Harris. Some would probably be happy with Joe Biden, but perhaps more the Biden of their memories than the man who will have to move far enough left to capture the Democratic nomination.
The fact is, barring some extraordinary event that no one can predict, the 2020 presidential race will be between President Trump and a Democratic challenger.
Trump will be chosen by Republicans. The Democrat will be chosen by Democrats.
And one of the two will be sworn in as president on Jan. 20, 2021.

Never-Trump quandary: When you want Trump to lose but can’t bear

Texto completo: The Democratic debates have been hard on Never Trumpers. The small but vocal group of Republicans and former Republicans who oppose President Donald Trump has watched in horror as Democrats veered leftward, embracing "Medicare for All," virtually open borders, sky-high taxes and other positions no conservative could ever accept. The Never Trumpers see disaster coming in the form of the president winning re-election over a Democrat who moved too far left for the American voter.
So they issue warnings. The Democrats’ performance in the most recent debate was "worse than farcical," The New York Times’ Bret Stephens wrote. "It’s tragic. It will make the Trump campaign’s job of selling the president as the non-insane option in next year’s election shamefully easy."
Bill Kristol, the former Dan Quayle aide who founded the now-shuttered Weekly Standard, tweeted, "Best moment in this debate: ‘It’s time for closing statements.’" After the first debate — a widely watched event that gave voters across the nation their initial impression of the Democratic field — some Never Trumpers were deeply alarmed.
"Trump wants to portray Democrats as open-border socialists," wrote The Washington Post’s Max Boot. "And in their eagerness to court progressive primary voters, the candidates are playing into his hands."
The alarm sometimes felt personal, as when the Times’ David Brooks issued a plea: "Dems, Please Don’t Drive Me Away." The columnist announced that he could "never in a million years vote for Donald Trump," and plaintively asked Democrats: "Will there be a candidate I can vote for?"
Maybe not. The fretting and complaining, coming from people who had been Republicans until Trump came along, set some liberals on edge.
"We should just ditch this whole primary thing and just have a small panel of Never Trump Republicans solomonically decide which Democrat would make them most comfortable," tweeted MSNBC’s Chris Hayes.
"I, for one, have pretty much had it with the chorus of center-right voices braying that the Democrats are heading for certain doom ... if the party picks a nominee who actually embraces the party’s ideals," wrote the Post’s Eugene Robinson, adding that "Never Trump Republicans and independents may be shocked to hear this, but the Democratic Party is likely to nominate a Democrat for president."
The pushback served to highlight the Never Trump dilemma. First, they went through a torturous process searching for a candidate to support in the 2016 election. Now, it’s happening again.
The 2020 problem is twofold. The first part is that there is no hope of challenging Trump within the Republican Party structure. As sitting president, Trump controls the Republican National Committee and has the support of the vast majority of GOP voters. The only Republican running against Trump so far is William Weld, the former governor of Massachusetts who left office more than 20 years ago. With scant polling, it is not clear how much support Weld has, but it’s not much.
The second part of the Never Trump dilemma is the depressingly woke Democratic field. Only a few Never Trumpers would be able to support a Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren or Kamala Harris. Some would probably be happy with Joe Biden, but perhaps more the Biden of their memories than the man who will have to move far enough left to capture the Democratic nomination.
So with no hope of stopping Trump inside the GOP, and with Democrats moving in an unacceptable direction, what to do?
There’s always hope that some Republican more prominent than Weld will defy the odds and challenge Trump in the primaries. There aren’t a lot of choices. Mark Sanford, the former South Carolina governor and congressman who lost a GOP primary in 2018, says he is thinking about running on a platform of fiscal responsibility. That’s unlikely to generate much voter excitement.
Some Never Trumpers would like to see Rep. Justin Amash, who recently left the GOP over Trump, take on the president, although running in the Republican primaries might be a stretch for someone who has just left the Republican Party.
Some might also search for a candidate of neither party whom they can support in the general election. If that happens, it could well end up like 2016, when Never Trumpers supported Evan McMullin, an ex-CIA agent who received 731,788 votes, or 0.54% of the total votes cast. He was not exactly an inspiring standard-bearer.
The fact is, barring some extraordinary event that no one can predict, the 2020 presidential race will be between President Trump and a Democratic challenger. Trump will be chosen by Republicans. The Democrat will be chosen by Democrats. And one of the two will be sworn in as president on Jan. 20, 2021.

Sue Gordon out as deputy spy chief

Texto completo: Sue Gordon is leaving the role of No. 2 spy chief in the U.S., ending a guessing game about whether President Trump would choose her to succeed outgoing Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats in an acting capacity.
With Coats resigning next Thursday, Gordon was slated to become acting director until a nominee was confirmed, per a federal statute. Trump even told reporters Friday he liked Gordon and did not rule out allowing her to become acting spy chief. "I like Sue Gordon. Sue Gordon is there now, and I like her very much. I’ve always liked her," he said.
But that changed Thursday after Gordon informed the president of her decision to resign.
"Sue Gordon is a great professional with a long and distinguished career. I have gotten to know Sue over the past 2 years and have developed great respect for her. Sue has announced she will be leaving on August 15, which coincides with the retirement of Dan Coats. A new Acting Director of National Intelligence will be named shortly," Trump tweeted Thursday evening.
Tweet
In her resignation letter, revealed by a White House press pool report, Gordon thanked Trump, "for the opportunity to serve the Nation as the Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence for the past two years. It has been an honor."
She added, "As you ask a new leadership team to take the helm, I will resign my position effective 15 August 2019, and will subsequently retire from federal service. I am confident in what the Intelligence Community has accomplished, and what it is poised to do going forward. I have seen it in action first-hand for more than 30 years. Know that our people are our strength, and they will never fail you or the Nation. You are in good hands."
About an hour after announcing Gordon's resignation, Trump announced retired Navy Vice Adm. Joseph Maguire, the director of the National Counterterrorism Center, was his pick to be acting director of national intelligence.
Tweet
There had been signs that Trump would circumvent Gordon from temporarily overseeing the U.S. intelligence community.
The White House requested a list of top officials who have worked in intelligence in what some saw as another sign Trump was looking at options beyond Gordon to take over temporarily. Trump also did not allow Gordon, who has served for more than 30 years in intelligence posts, to deliver a recent intelligence briefing at the White House, according to a recent New York Times report. A spokeswoman for the agency pushed back on that account, saying Gordon was not prevented from attending any recent briefing but did not elaborate on what happened.
Bloomberg reported Trump's allies outside the White House had urged him to remove Gordon, claiming she was too close to former CIA Director John Brennan, who is a vocal critic of Trump.
A top Republican on Capitol Hill called Gordon's retirement a "significant loss" to the U.S. intelligence community. "In more than three decades of public service, Sue earned the respect and admiration of her colleagues with her patriotism and vision. She has been a stalwart partner to the Senate Intelligence Committee, and I will miss her candor and deep knowledge of the issues. I look forward to seeing what new challenges she will tackle next," Richard Burr, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in a statement.
Democrats were upset by reporting that said Trump might bypass Gordon for the acting role.
Rep. Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said, "The plain language of the law requires that [Gordon] be elevated to that role once Dan Coats steps down." The California Democrat argued that if the Trump administration bypasses her, it will be "further evidence of Trump's intent to politicize the Intelligence Community to serve his partisan aims."
Trump chose Rep. John Ratcliffe to be his nominee to replace Coats, but he announced last week he was dropping Ratcliffe as his pick amid scrutiny over the Texas Republican's credentials.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Wednesday that he is likely to commute former Gov. Rod Blagojevich’s sentence.
Speaking to reporters on Air Force One as they flew back to Washington from El Paso, Texas, the president hinted he was open to giving Blagojevich, 62, a break, the Chicago Sun-Times reported.
Blagojevich has served about half of a 14-year federal prison sentence for corruption that included seeking to sell an appointment to the Senate seat Barack Obama vacated to become president.
"In the last hour of the flight, POTUS came back to the press cabin for a 45-minute off-the-record conversation. He then said the press could put one part on the record — that he is again considering commuting the sentence of former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich," the pool report said.
"I thought he was treated unbelievably unfairly; he was given close to 18 years in prison. And a lot of people thought it was unfair, like a lot of other things — and it was the same gang, the Comey gang and all these sleazebags that did it. And his name is Rod Blagojevich," the president said, misstating Blagojevich’s sentence.
"He’s been in jail for seven years over a phone call where nothing happens — over a phone call which he shouldn’t have said what he said, but it was braggadocio you would say. I would think that there have been many politicians — I’m not one of them, by the way — that have said a lot worse over the telephone."
The New York Times’ Maggic Haberman tweeted that Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, had pushed for a pardon, but aides instead persuaded Trump to agree to commutation.
In June 2018, Trump broached the possibility of freeing Blagojevich, suggesting the one-time "Celebrity Apprentice" contestant was convicted for "being stupid."
Wife Patti Blagojevich has waged a focused campaign — primarily in FOX News appearances and through social media — to appeal to Trump for clemency, the Sun-Times reported.
"His wife I think is fantastic, and I’m thinking about commuting his sentence very strongly. I think it’s enough, seven years," Trump said.
Contacted by a Sun-Times reporter late Wednesday, Patti Blagojevich was surprised to hear of the president’s comments but declined to comment.
Blagojevich is scheduled to be released on May 23, 2024. He currently is serving his sentence in Colorado.
In 2018, Trump first dangled the potential of helping Blagojevich. That prompted seven GOP House members from Illinois to urge the president not to commute the sentence after Trump raised the possibility of clemency.

Texto completo: ASHEVILLE – Two years ago, the Skybar hosted the Flatiron's 90th birthday celebration. According to an Aug. 6 announcement, the locally beloved cocktail bar will not see 2020.
It will instead close its doors to make way for construction on the Flatiron in 2020, after a contentious battle over the building's future eventually led to its fate: a boutique hotel with a restaurant, retail, commercial space and its own expanded rooftop bar.
"It is with a heavy heart we inform you this will be Skybar's last season," the Flatiron fixture's Facebook page reads. "Thank you for your support over the years. We hope to see you again before the season comes to an end. Asheville, it's been a good run."
The Skybar spans balconies on floors 6-8 in the historic Flatiron Building on the corner of Battery Park Avenue and Wall Street.
The New York Times in 2016 praised the views of this "glorified fire escape," the elevation and the position of which affords stunning views of the Western part of downtown Asheville and mountains beyond. "They say we've got the largest panorama in Asheville," majority owner Russell Thomas told the Citizen Times in 2017.
It's hard to say whether that remains true. Asheville's hotel boom has brought with it more than just a surfeit of rooms; it's also created a rash of rooftop bars and mountain-view balconies. Skybar, which opened in 2006, was once the only place downtown to drink in the views with a cocktail; now it's one of many.
Then there's the recent drama surrounding the Flatiron Building itself.
From business use to boutique hotel In a project headed by developer Philip Woollcott, the building is slated to be converted next year from primarily small business use to a 71-room boutique hotel with restaurant, street-level retail and commercial office space.
Woollcott, of the Flatiron Preservation Group, vowed to return the structure to its "original glory" after years of deferred maintenance left it with some high-dollar needs, including upgrades to its electrical, plumbing and sprinkler systems.
But the project — approved in June by City Council on a 4-3 vote — was met with degrees of pushback from neighbors and community residents, many of whom argued against the addition of another downtown hotel. Its approval largely is the basis of an impending conversation by council about a temporary ban on hotel construction.
Flatiron Preservation Group spokeswoman Jill Lieberman said in an Aug. 7 email the Skybar currently is operating on its normal schedule and will remain open until the end of the season, which typically comes in late October. After that time, it's expected to close its doors, clearing the way for construction on the building.
"The Flatiron Building will be under construction for the majority of 2020 and part of the updates include an expanded rooftop bar that will be open to the public," Lieberman said.
Representatives from the Skybar did not immediately answer requests for further comment.

Texto completo: Other than the fact that the view from the grocery store parking lot is as good as any you'll find on the Blue Ridge Parkway, the first two things I came to love about Back Mountain were the townspeople and the walkability.
I moved here from Ashe County, the northwesternmost part of the state, where I had the quintessential writer's nest: an A-frame on 15 acres overlooking the New River where two white horses grazed and galloped in the low pasture on the other side of the river. In 2003, my elder daughter was starting a family here, so I sold that house and made the jump.
Truth be told, I never aspired to live near Asheville, considering it...perhaps too weird? And watching The New York Times repeatedly write up Asheville as one of the best places to retire, I wondered if Asheville would wind up with a sense of place, a sense of history. After growing up in Charlotte and watching that city methodically destroy its historical landmarks and vintage homes, I simply cannot bear a repeat. Black Mountain, it seemed to me, was a small town that had managed to hold on to who it was, despite sitting in a valley fifteen miles east of Asheville in a valley with a freight trains and a coast-to-coast interstate bisecting the town.
But the first thing about Black Mountain that I fell in love with was the people, beginning with the folks at Town Hardware and my neighbors on Fifth Street. Walking out my front door, down the street and into Town Hardware with Sequoya, my trusted Siberian Husky, several times a week was a small-town delight that nurtured me in ways I had never experienced before.
As soon as we stepped over the threshold onto that aged wooden floor, she'd stop, brace herself on all fours and give one of those full-throttle howls that the breeds descended from wolves are known for. Whoever was at the register would pull out the biscuit jar and have several ready before we reached them.
Sequoya always acted like no one had ever given her a biscuit before. "I do give her biscuits," I'd laugh, a little apologetically. At one point, I ordered the same kind of biscuits they handed her, but Sequoya made it clear that getting biscuits at Town Hardware was one of the highlights of her life.
The sage Town Hardware employees and I learned each other's names, much easier for me because they wear convenient name tags. Until I moved here, I had never walked into a store and heard the shopkeeper call me by name. There is something primal, something distinctly tribal, about calling someone by his name, by her name. It makes you feel that you are known, if only by your habits.
It makes you feel that you belong. Flash forward 12 years, when Sequoya's hips were too arthritic to want to sit for the biscuit: the guys at Town Hardware understood and gave her the biscuits anyway.

At Barneys, Pride Went Before a Fall

Texto completo: It has been striking, over the last few weeks, to watch the almost gleeful flow of reports and speculation about the maybe-probably-now-confirmed bankruptcy of Barneys New York, the fabled department store.
Starting in mid-July, when Reuters broke the news that a rent hike at the Madison Avenue store was putting Barneys under untenable pressure, the rumors have come with notably regularity: It could happen as early as this week! O.K., maybe next week! They have hired bankruptcy advisers! Designers won't send their merch! Bathrooms aren't being cleaned!
And so on until Monday, when it all proved true.
Barneys is not the first New York store to have problems, nor the first department store. The sector as a whole has been experiencing a major retrenchment in the face of changing consumer shopping habits and the growth of e-tail, which has made going to a store much more about experience than just buying stuff.
[ A visual history of how Barneys built a brand of cool .]
As Scott Malkin, the founder of the luxury outlet malls Value Retail, once told The New York Times: "The war is over. Alibaba won."
And unlike stores like Henri Bendel and Lord & Taylor, which have disappeared from the map of Manhattan -- Lord & Taylor becoming (shock! horror!) a WeWork -- Barneys is staying on Madison. (The company is downsizing 15 other locations, but using a $ 75 million debtor in possession financing to restructure the business. That's the point of the Chapter 11.)
Yet its ills have been chronicled with almost obsessive attention. Indeed, it's possible the attention contributed to the ills: As the store stayed silent about what was going on, rumors flew, creating an atmosphere that sent many of the smaller designers Barneys stocks into fits of nervous terror as they worried about what they would do with orders the store placed five months ago and for which they feared they might never be paid.
At which point they decided to stop delivering the orders, at which point Barneys looked like it was in more trouble, and so on.
So what makes Barneys so special? Why was the tale of woe at this store different from the tales of all other stores?
Because of what Barneys set itself up to represent.
From the beginning -- especially in the beginning -- Barneys held itself apart from the other department stores, not only in New York but pretty much everywhere. Its Madison Avenue store, which opened in 1993, was an extravagantly unmistakable symbol of that separateness and that aspiration: the largest new specialty store to be built in Manhattan since the Depression, and one that broke all the rules.
As Gene Pressman, the grandson of Barney Pressman, the founder, told The Times: "Of course, there are a lot of stores uptown. But there'll be only one Barneys. We're different."
Employing the architect Peter Marino, who is now the crown prince of fashion store design (he created the look of boutiques for Armani, Dior, Louis Vuitton, Zegna), the company let him loose to change the paradigm.
That's what the Pressmans did, starting when Fred (second generation, father of Bob and Gene) brought Armani's relaxed tailoring to the United States in 1975 and threw men's suiting into an uproar.
As he did, so did Gene with women's wear, championing Rei Kawakubo of Comme des Garçons and Azzedine Alaïa, of the clinging bandage dress, as well as black in all its permutations, and the idea of the exclusive. As Joshua Levine writes in his 1999 book, "The Rise and Fall of the House of Barneys," "If it couldn't be bought differently, Barneys insisted that it be made differently."
Barneys changed trims and buttons according to its own taste, just as with Mr. Marino it changed the conventional wisdom about how a store should be organized. It put perfumes at the back of the first floor instead of the front, as was customary (perfume being an entry-level product); it put Kazuko Oshima's idiosyncratic jewelry constructions of crystals and semiprecious stones wrapped in wires at the front; and, most of all, it used the windows -- windows! -- on most floors to let the light in, instead of covering the walls to create more shelf and rack space.
The implicit message, on all counts, being: Barneys knows best.
The result was wonderful for the new designers the store might take a gamble on (despite the fact that Barneys often demanded exclusivity in return, a promise that could seem alluring but often proved stifling), and it made Barneys a destination for shopping tourists in search of the cutting edge.
But it was also unabashedly elitist, proudly exclusionary -- you got it or you didn't, and if you didn't, that was your problem, not theirs -- and imbued with an arrogance that, at a certain point, began to chafe. Even if it did feel representative of a certain, almost fictional, New York ethos. Even if the warehouse sales, held at the downtown outlet with the excitement of an open secret, were open to anyone willing to wait in the always very long lines, and navigate the scrum once inside.
And though the Pressmans lost control of the store after its first bankruptcy filing in 1996, and in 2010 a new management team embarked on a renovation that gave the store a more familiar, if somewhat generic, elegance, and it became much more interested in service (a change that, perversely, caused many to start mourning its former, our-way-or-the-highway incarnation), Barneys never quite lost that reputation.
As a result, when the possibility of its demise was discussed, it was with a certain lascivious horror: Ooh, it would be terrible, but we just can't look away.
Barneys put itself up on a precisely buffed onyx pedestal that it built for itself, and it turned out everyone was just waiting to knock it off. To blame it for not recognizing the rise of digital fast enough or for abandoning its original idiosyncrasy. To see this as a story of taste atrophy, more than, say, the shadow real estate world, or disaffected ownership, when it was probably a combination of all three.
If the attention paid to the bankruptcy proves anything, however, it is that the brand itself still resonates (and rankles) in the imagination. In other words, the rumor mill will now turn to whether or not a buyer for the company will emerge.
Let the speculation begin! But as it does, it's worth remembering: As much as chroniclers of New York love a comeuppance story, they also love a comeback.

Vogue Beyoncé Portrait Headed to Smithsonian

Texto completo: A striking portrait of Beyoncé, shot by the rising photographer Tyler Mitchell for Vogue's all-important September issue last year, is on its way to the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery in Washington.
Mr. Mitchell, who is the first African-American photographer and one of the youngest to shoot a cover for Vogue, announced the news online on Tuesday.
"A year ago today we broke the flood gates open," Mr. Mitchell said on Instagram. "Since then it was important to spend the whole year running through them making sure every piece of the gate was knocked down. And now I'm glad to share this picture is being acquired into" the museum.
Concetta Duncan, a spokeswoman for the museum, confirmed the acquisition, but said the piece would not be on permanent display. It's under discussion as to when the photograph will go on view, she said.
"We are delighted to acquire this magnificent portrait of Beyoncé," Leslie Ureña, associate curator of photographs for the museum, said in a statement. "This particular work brought us closer to Beyoncé's words, appearing within the magazine's pages, and showing us more of the historic shoot."
Ms. Duncan said that since 2013, museum leadership had made a conscious effort to ensure 50 percent of its acquisitions feature subjects or artists that make the museum's collections more diverse. The gallery also said on Twitter that its mission is "to tell the story of America by portraying the people who shape this nation's history, development, and culture."
In the Vogue photograph, Beyoncé leans on a white column and looks out on the camera, wearing a shimmering Valentino dress and a gold Philip Treacy London headpiece. A 23-time Grammy Award winner, the star saw her film of her critically acclaimed Coachella performance be nominated for six Emmys.
In the September issue last year, Beyoncé addressed a wide range of topics, among them motherhood, body image, ancestry and diversity.
"Until there is a mosaic of perspectives coming from different ethnicities behind the lens, we will continue to have a narrow approach and view of what the world actually looks like," she said. "That is why I wanted to work with this brilliant 23-year-old photographer."
Mr. Mitchell grew up in Marietta, Ga., and graduated from the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University in 2017. He then worked with the cerebral rapper Kevin Abstract and the designer Marc Jacobs.
"I depict black people and people of color in a really real and pure way," he told The New York Times that year. "There is an honest gaze to my photos."
His big break came in 2015: For a documentary photography program, he spent six weeks in Cuba, where he captured Havana's skateboard culture and crumbling architecture. He published the results in "El Paquete," a 108-page photography book.
His first solo exhibition, "I Can Make You Feel Good," went on view at Foam in Amsterdam this spring, featuring numerous images and commissioned work.
Though this is Mr. Mitchell's first piece in the National Portrait Gallery, it will be the second image of Beyoncé acquired by the museum.
A color photolithographic halftone promotional poster for Beyoncé's 2003 album "Dangerously in Love," with the words "CD In Stores June 24" along the bottom, currently hangs in the "20th Century Americans: 2000 to Present" gallery of the museum, according to the gallery's website. Ms. Duncan, the spokeswoman, said the museum did not know if the Mitchell photograph would replace the 2003 poster. Neither representatives for Mr. Mitchell nor for Beyoncé immediately returned requests for interviews.
The poster, shot by Markus Klinko and Indrani Pal-Chaudhuri, was a gift to the museum in 2012 from the Chisholm-Larsson Gallery in Manhattan.
Robert Chisholm, a co-owner of the gallery, which specializes in original vintage posters, had not been aware of the new acquisition, but praised the singer.
"She's certainly an iconic figure," Mr. Chisholm said on Tuesday. "I think it's great that they're including this new photograph and particularly if it's a new young African-American photographer."
The National Portrait Gallery was established by an act of Congress in 1962 and opened to the public in 1968. The museum's collection holds more than 23,000 pieces, including the only complete collection of presidential portraits outside of the White House, as well as portraits of athletes, artists and other prominent figures throughout history.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: U.S. Rep. Deb Haaland, D-N.M., is facing a defamation lawsuit over comments she made to the press and on social media about a January incident on the National Mall involving teenagers from a Catholic school in Kentucky and a Native American demonstrator.
The parents of eight students from Covington Catholic High School filed suit on behalf of their sons last week in Kenton County Circuit Court in Kentucky against Haaland and 11 other defendants, including U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., CNN political analyst Ana Navarro, New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman and comedian Kathy Griffin, over comments they made after the encounter between Covington Catholic students and Native American veteran Nathan Phillips on Jan. 18. Video of the incident went viral.
The lawsuit claimed the defendants “used their large social media platforms, perceived higher credibility and public followings to lie and libel minors they never met, based on an event they never witnessed.”
Haaland's office told the Journal on Tuesday that the congresswoman has not been served with the complaint and has not reviewed the lawsuit. It also said she couldn't comment on pending litigation.
Initial videos portrayed the students as mocking Phillips as he beat on a drum in front of the Lincoln Memorial. Videos with wider angles showed Phillips wading into the Covington Catholic students as words were reportedly exchanged between the group and a gathering of nearby protesters called the Black Hebrew Israelites. Phillips claimed in interviews that he was afraid of the students, many of whom were wearing red “Make America Great Again” hats.
But the lawsuit claims Phillips had clear paths to avoid the students.
The lawsuit also claims each of the defendants was asked to retract, correct or delete comments they made about the incident, but that the defendants refused. The suit claims the comments were offending and defamatory.
Haaland had spoken to the press about the incident.
“I feel like some of that has truly been lost and that's all condoned by our president,” Haaland told The Hill in an interview Jan. 19, referring to a decline in mutual respect in recent years. “You could tell that by the hats they were wearing.”
Haaland told The Hill she hoped the school and their parents “look deep into themselves” and teach their children “some manners and respect.”
“Every student in this country should know that there would be no United States without Native Americans,” Haaland said. “It's a shame they didn't sit and listen quietly and learn. … It was wrongheaded for them to antagonize him, so I hope they learn some Native American history and cultural sensitivity.”
Among Haaland's posts about the incident on Twitter:
“A Native American Vietnam War veteran was seen being harassed and mocked by a group of MAGA hat-wearing teens.” The post linked to a story by the Huffington Post.
“This Veteran put his life on the line for our country. The students' display of blatant hate, disrespect, and intolerance is a signal of how common decency has decayed under this administration. Heartbreaking.”
A comprehensive examination of several videos seemed to back up the students' claims that they did not instigate the incident involving Phillips.
The suit seeks between $15,000 and $50,000 from each defendant, or more than the cost of four years' tuition at the University of Kentucky. It says the plaintiffs seek no fame or fortune but seek to protect future families from “experiencing the nightmare the defendants caused these kids to experience.”
The suit claims the students were subjected to public hatred, scorn and shame.
Los Angeles attorney Robert Barnes and Kevin L. Murphy of Murphy Landen Jones in Fort Mitchell, Kentucky, represent the plaintiffs.
Barnes made an offer to represent the students pro bono on Twitter and various broadcast networks, including the weekday morning TV news show “Fox & Friends” days after the incident.
According to his firm's website, Barnes has also represented Alex Jones in one of the suits brought against him by parents of children killed in the Sandy Hook Elementary School mass shooting in 2012 over alleged comments by Jones they claimed called the shootings a hoax, and actor Wesley Snipes in a case against the Internal Revenue Service.
The suit involving Haaland was filed a week after a federal judge in Kentucky dismissed a $250million libel suit against The Washington Post filed by Nicholas Sandmann, the Covington student shown on videos smiling in front of Phillips. U.S. District Judge William O. Bertelsman ruled that the Post's stories and tweets were protected by the First Amendment. He found none of the statements that Sandmann sued about defamatory, but said the majority constituted opinion.
His parents said they planned to appeal the decision.

Dolphins on TV, but viewing may be tricky

Texto completo: When the Dolphins open their preseason Thursday night against the Atlanta Falcons, the good news for armchair fans is two South Florida TV stations will carry the action.
The bad news is that for some fans, watching won’t be as simple as reaching for the remote.
The worse news is if you’re a fan of any of the local pro sports teams, the forecast calls for a frustrating season with a high probability of dark TV screens.
First, the Dolphins. Their game against the Falcons kicks off at 7:30 p.m. Thursday, with coverage anchored by WFOR-Channel 4 in Miami and simulcast by sister station WPEC-Channel 12 in West Palm Beach.
Simple, right? If you receive Ch. 12, yes. If Ch. 4 is your CBS affiliate and your provider is owned by AT&T, you won’t be able to see the game.
Why?
There is an ongoing dispute between CBS and AT&T over fees that providers pay networks to carry their signals. That means 6.5 million subscribers to DirecTV, U-verse and AT&T Now (formerly DirecTV Now) are not receiving CBS programming because they’re in one of 17 markets in which the CBS affiliate is owned by the network. Those markets include Miami, Tampa, New York, Atlanta and Los Angeles.
Channel 4 is affected by the blackout, but Ch. 12 is not. Officials at those stations confirmed Tuesday that even in the case of Ch. 12 picking up Ch. 4’s feed for the game, the blackout will not apply. If you receive Ch. 12 now, you should be able to grab the popcorn with confidence.
As for those who recently lost Ch. 4, you still have options, but you won’t want to wait until 7:29 p.m. Thursday to explore them:
— The Dolphins plan to stream the three preseason games carried by Ch. 4 (vs. the Falcons, Bucs and Saints) at dolphins.com in South Florida only. The Aug. 22 game vs. the Jaguars is on Fox and unaffected.
— You can consider dumping your provider for one that isn’t owned by AT&T, provided you’re not bound by a long-term contract. (Remember, Ch. 4 also airs most Dolphins regular-season games.)
— You can subscribe to CBS All Access.
— You can go old school. Many inexpensive digital antennas do a terrific job picking up HD over-the-air signals from scores of local stations you probably never knew existed. You might even have luck picking up Ch. 4 simply by attaching a few yards of loose coaxial cable to the antenna port on your TV.
Sources told The New York Times the dispute centers around CBS seeking to raise its carriage fee from $2 per AT&T subscriber to $3.
As annoying as the situation is, tempers could really flare during the regular season if the “all-inclusive” NFL Sunday Ticket package on DirecTV is no longer all inclusive.
Recent seasons have shown an increase in popularity in the two distinct versions of “red zone” channels that jump from game to game whenever teams get into scoring position. It’s especially popular with fantasy football owners. DirecTV’s version is the Red Zone Channel hosted by Andrew Siciliano. The NFL Network’s version, NFL RedZone, is hosted by Scott Hanson. Although those channels aspire to show every score live or nearly live, league and broadcast officials were unsure if the dispute will curtail those stations’ ability to cover every game.
Maybe you’re not a football fan and you’re relieved you can still watch the Marlins, Heat or Panthers. Don’t count on it. The local affiliates covering those teams, Fox Sports Florida and Fox Sports Sun, have been booted off Dish Network and Sling in a similar dispute.
There was a time when such negotiations were typically settled at the 11th hour or close to it. Despite more viewers cutting the cord, putting pressure on providers, these carriage disputes are more frequent and last longer.
Dish subscribers have been without HBO since November — including the final season of “Game of Thrones.” And, in an ominous sign for Marlins, Heat and Panthers fans, Dish chairman Charlie Ergen said on a quarterly earnings call that the regional sports networks may never return to his system, according to AdAge.

Texto completo: The United States is truly a unique country. This is neither hyperbole nor an expression of unthinking patriotism. It realistically reflects demographics and a multiplicity of religious and secular beliefs. We are not a perfect nation, and we will continue to struggle to improve our uniqueness.
David Brooks in the New York Times quoted an unnamed person at a conference of local community leaders: "We're trying to do something that has never been done before. We're trying to create the earth's first mass, multicultural democratic republic." This succinctly defines the uniqueness of America.
Because of who we are as Americans, as a Jew I can answer the fears of some of my fellow religionists. No, the Holocaust may have happened in sophisticated Germany, but it will not happen here. This is not to say that we are a perfect country, nor does it ignore the fact that we are amid a nativist revival headed by a deeply flawed and prejudiced president. There is a Hebrew phrase, "gahm zeh ya'avor... this too shall pass."
From the beginning of our nation there was doubt about whether a country could survive diversity of beliefs. James Madison in the 10th Federalist Paper answered the doubters: "Freedom arises from the multiplicity of sects, which pervades America, and which is the best and only security for religious liberty in any society."
Madison often quoted Voltaire's comment that "if one religion only were allowed in England, the government would possibly be arbitrary; if there were but two, the people would cut each other's throats; but as there are such a multitude, they all live happy and in peace."
In 21st century America, diversity includes not only religious beliefs, but ethnic, racial and sexual diversity. But Madison's truth still applies. This is not to say that we are all happy and at peace. Our challenges are constant. There have been times in our history when we had to overcome nativism and bigotry, and we can do it again today.
The most egregious examples of nativism in our history include: the rise of the Know-Nothing Party which railed against Catholic immigration. In 1850 it received 22% of the popular vote in the presidential election; in 1882 we passed a law which denied citizenship to Chinese Americans (not repealed until 1943); in 1924 we passed the National Origins Act which essentially denied entrance to our country to people of color, southern Europeans and Jews. Yet we still have arrived at the beginnings of the first mass, multicultural democratic republic.
We will continue along this path despite the current president and those who hate everyone different from themselves, including Muslims, Mexicans, dark-skinned people, non-religious-believers, and the LGBTQ community.
After the spectacle in Washington, D.C. this last July 4th, I was drawn back to Ronald Reagan's July 4th, 1986 speech, delivered on the aircraft carrier U.S.S. Kennedy, harbored in the shadow of the Statue of Liberty. In contrast to displaying military might, he reviewed past military courage, and then, speaking directly to the sailors, he hoped that the "call for their courage will never come." He then said, "It is important for us, too, to be brave; not so much the bravery of the battlefield, I mean the bravery of brotherhood."
The bravery of brotherhood: what a beautiful phrase! I can understand its meaning only by acknowledging that brotherhood is not an innate part of human nature. Going back to the cave man, anyone who is different is a possible danger. Oscar Hammerstein II wrote a beautiful song for South Pacific that said that you must be taught to hate. It may be just the opposite. We must learn to overcome our natural xenophobia. Brotherhood is the product of a civilized society. Humans must work at it, day to day, to maintain civilization.
Today, we need the bravery of brotherhood as an antidote to the messages coming out of our current government. We have had bumps in the past, and I am sure we will have future bumps as well. But barring any catastrophic event that none of us can conceive, I believe that the march of civilization will protect this emerging mass, multicultural democratic republic.
All kinds of races, religions, ethnicities will be safe in this country. A genocide will not happen here, simply because we are a unique country.

7 summer deals to meet the heat in luxury

Texto completo: Headnote CHILLING IN THE DESERT
To celebrate my daughter's college graduation in May, I wanted to treat her to a luxurious getaway with my sister. We initially eyed a spa weekend in Massachusetts or Pennsylvania, but got sticker shock from the prices, which averaged $2,000 per person for the weekend. My sister, a seasoned traveler, got an idea. If it was luxury we craved, why not stay at an upscale resort in a place that's eager to attract tourists in the summer?
We decided on a long weekend in July at Andaz Scottsdale Resort & Bungalows in Scottsdale, Arizona, where the temperatures ranged from 90 to 110 degrees. The resort's "Heat It Up in Scottsdale" summer package starts at $189 a night and includes two cocktails per person per day, a waived resort fee (usually a $39-a-day charge), a full breakfast for each person, served until 3 p.m., and 25% off spa services. Compare that to peak season rates, which start at $349 a night, without any of the inclusions.
The 185-room resort, redeveloped in 2016, consists of exquisite, midcentury-modern, single-story bungalows with their own entrances and patios. We upgraded to a 750-square-foot suite for $344 a night, which, in our case, included two roomy bathrooms with 40-square-foot showers. The upgrade came with a private, poolside cabana with a plush couch, table and chairs, a ceiling fan and a flat-screen television.
Other perks and amenities were a "libation exploration" class, where visitors are instructed on how to make their favorite cocktails; a free early morning yoga class by the pool with Camelback Mountain as the backdrop, and complimentary homemade potato chips, chocolates and salt water taffy in the room.
Vacationing in this type of heat takes strategic planning. We typically rose by 6 a.m. or so to hike in the nearby mountains or sit poolside with our coffee. Afternoons were spent in the pool, sipping cocktails while perched in comfy floats. We found containers of ice water, along with sunscreen and aloe pump bottles, strategically placed throughout the resort. Besides cheaper rates, sweltering temperatures kept the crowds down; on a weekday, we had the giant pool nearly to ourselves.
The Andaz is one of several desert destinations offering a taste of luxury at bargain rates in the summer. Here's a glimpse at a few others.
Scottsdale, Arizona Hyatt Regency Scottsdale Resort & Spa at Gainey Ranch
The amenities: Stellar views of the McDowell Mountains and an amazing water scene, which by itself is dazzling, provide ample opportunities to stay cool. There are 10 swimming pools - including one for adults - 20 fountains, 45 waterfalls and a 30-foot, three-story, highspeed waterslide, as well as a man-made beach with a 5,000-square-foot sandy beach area. For $15 an hour per child, children ages 3 to 12 can attend the resort's activity-filled Camp Hyatt. There's also a spa, a golf course and eight restaurants.
The deal: With "Summer Made Simple," children 12 and under get a free dinner each day from the children's menu in two of the restaurants, as long as at least one adult is paying for a full-price meal. Children 18 and under play one round of golf free per day with a paying adult. Rates start at $139 per night, not including the $40-plus tax resort fee, which covers self-parking and bicycle rentals. Peak season rates start at $450 a night.
Beating the heat: The resort offers several poolside activities, including watermelon-eating contests, inner tube races and water balloon tosses. There's also nightly live entertainment when the sun goes down.
Tucson, Arizona Miraval Arizona
The amenities: Situated in the Santa Catalina Mountains, Miraval Arizona is a premiere wellness spa. The all-inclusive resort, where no tipping is allowed, features casita-style accommodations. There are more than 120 complimentary wellness activities, lectures and fitness classes weekly, along with three pools and 24-hour access to a newly renovated Body Mindfulness Fitness Center.
The deal: Summer rates start at $399 per person per night, compared to $699 in the winter. Rates include: a $175 nightly resort credit per person that can be used toward spa services; classes like beekeeping and cooking or private sessions for services like personalized nutrition counseling; fitness classes; all meals, as well as snacks, smoothies and nonalcoholic beverages; and shared shuttle transfers from Tucson International Airport.
Beating the heat: Most of the outdoor programs take place early in the morning. Miraval hosts a series of full moon programs each summer, including Celestial Yoga and Twilight Zipline.
Palm Springs, California The Rowan
The amenities: Opened in November 2017, The Rowan is the first new hotel built in downtown Palm Springs in decades and, at seven stories, the tallest. Each of the 153 rooms has either views of the nearby San Jacinto Mountains or private outdoor terraces. There's a rooftop pool with a bar, and custom-designed bikes available for guests to borrow. An evening social hour offers free beer and wine. Access to hiking trails are right in the hotel's backyard.
The deal: The Rowan offers a global summer sale: Rates start at $147 a night for midweek stays (compared to $289 during high season), and at $225 for weekends (compared to $289 during high season). Its "100 days of Rose" package, offered for stays through Sept. 20 to those 21 and over, includes two cans of rose a day and a 2 p.m. late checkout. Rates start at $200 a night, compared to $289 for the high season rate.
Beating the heat: Guests can watch the summer's meteor showers from the hotel rooftop.
Las Vegas
Four Seasons Hotel
The amenities: Though it's on the famed Las Vegas Strip, the Four Seasons has a nonsmoking, nongaming atmosphere in a resort setting. In addition to the resort's private pool, guests can use the pool complex at the adjacent Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino. Guests also have access via a "secret" door to the casino-level entrance at Mandalay Bay.
The deal: Summer rates start at $220 per night versus $300 during peak season. Guests can also book the "Experience More" package, with rates starting at $280 per night, based on a two-night stay. This includes a $100 hotel credit that can be used for the spa or to book a private poolside cabana. Deals can be found here.
Beating the heat: The resort offers complimentary amenities poolside, including Evian spritzes, chilled fruit and oshibori towels.
Los Cabos, Mexico Las Vent anas al Para�so, A Rosewood Resort
The amenities: Situated on Cabo's coastline, this resort aims to provide the quintessential luxury experience. There are 84 accommodations, including 12 beach villas.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - "For 23 years, I was a jailhouse lawyer," said Calvin Duncan, a former inmate at the Louisiana State Penitentiary in Angola. "That was my assigned job."
He had a 10th-grade education and he was serving a life sentence for murder. The prison paid him 20 cents an hour to help his fellow prisoners with their cases.
He got good at it and he used his increasingly formidable legal skills to help free several inmates. He knew how to spot a promising legal issue and he was relentless. Seasoned lawyers sought his advice.
One issue in particular consumed Duncan. He could not understand how a Louisiana law that allowed non-unanimous juries in criminal cases could be constitutional. He would not let it go, working on about two dozen failed attempts to persuade the Supreme Court to address the issue.
The justices finally agreed in March to decide the question. They will hear arguments in the case, Ramos v. Louisiana, No. 18-5924, on the first day of their new term, on Oct. 7.
G. Ben Cohen, the lawyer who filed the petition in the latest case and many others, said Duncan had played a crucial role in identifying, shepherding and presenting the cases.
"From well before I was involved," Cohen said, "Calvin understood that this was a winning legal issue - how to frame it, raise it and challenge the non-unanimous law."
"The lessons that Calvin taught me were not just about the law," Cohen said. "They were about not giving up."
Emily Maw, a lawyer with Innocence Project New Orleans, said Duncan was persistence personified.
"He's been on it for decades, when no one was on it and no press was reporting it," she said. "Calvin pushed constantly. He has pushed when it was unpopular. He has pushed when no one thought it was going anywhere. He has pushed and pushed and pushed."
If the Supreme Court agrees with Duncan's position, Maw said, "it could save hundreds of men from life in prison."
Over time, many people came to question the Louisiana law, which allowed convictions by a 10-2 vote. Oregon is the only other state that allows non-unanimous verdicts in criminal cases.
Last year, Louisiana's voters amended the state Constitution to require unanimity, though only for crimes committed after 2018. In April, The Advocate newspaper in Baton Rouge won a Pulitzer Prize for a series of articles on the subject.
Duncan himself has nothing to gain from his efforts, having been convicted by a unanimous jury. The Innocence Project secured his release in 2011 as part of a deal in which he agreed to plead guilty to lesser charges in exchange for a sentence of time served. He has always maintained his innocence.
In prison, Duncan enjoyed the respect and affection of his fellow prisoners. One of them, acclaimed journalist Wilbert Rideau, wrote in his memoir that Duncan had "the most brilliant legal mind in Angola," the nation's largest maximum-security prison.
On the phone the other day, Rideau elaborated.
"You're talking," he said, "to somebody who is the direct beneficiary of his legal work."
Rideau was released in 2005 after Duncan helped him get a new trial.
"He did the legal research," Rideau said. "He put together the case. I would not be here but for Calvin. But I'm not the only guy. He got other guys out of prison, too."
Duncan was also a resource for real lawyers.
"I had a legal question I couldn't figure out," said Katherine Mattes, now a law professor at Tulane University, recalling her early days representing prisoners challenging their convictions. "I started asking capital defense lawyers around town. They said: 'I don't know the answer to that. Go ask Calvin Duncan.'"
She went to see him at the prison.
"I ask him the question," she said. "He immediately, off the top of his head, gives me the case name and the citation that answers the question."
While he was in Angola, Duncan was once allowed to visit Tulane's law library.
"Before prison I had never set foot on that campus," he said. "I said back then, and that was a long time ago, that I wanted to go to that university."
He was released on a Friday.
"That Tuesday, I was on the Tulane campus, trying to figure out how to go to school there," he said. "I was too late for the spring, but I enrolled for the fall."
He graduated last year.
"I was told I needed my bachelor's degree to go to law school," he said. "That's what I've been working on."
On the outside, Duncan continued to question the Louisiana law allowing non-unanimous verdicts.
"I went to the law library," he said. "I discovered that the law had been introduced for the purpose of making sure that white supremacy stayed alive."
In 1898, after the Supreme Court ruled that states could not exclude Black people from juries, Louisiana held a constitutional convention whose purpose, as the chairman of its judiciary committee put it, was "to establish the supremacy of the white race in this state to the extent to which it could be legally and constitutionally done."
The new state Constitution replaced a unanimity requirement with one that said the votes of 9 jurors out of 12 were enough to convict defendants of non-capital felonies. In 1973, the Constitution was amended to require 10 jurors to agree.
"They came up with a system to make sure that Black jurors' votes would not count," Duncan said. "If a Black did get on a jury, whatever they said would not count anyway. It's like the last of the Jim Crow-era laws."
Duncan visited Mattes' law school clinic not long after he was released. The students were in their third year, tired of studying and perhaps a little jaded.
Duncan asked to see the law library, and he marveled at the vast and pristine collections of cases, codes and treatises.
"All of a sudden, he stops and he turns to the students," Mattes said. "He gets very serious and he says: 'You guys need to know how incredibly lucky you are. Because what you have here is power.'" - (The New York Times)

Texto completo: Headnote Even jaywalking could jam up the era of autonomous vehicles
Imagine Manhattan without jaywalking.
Or Los Angeles freeways without speeding or Moscow without grinding traffic.
If self-driving cars are going to move forward, these are among the many possibilities that the people dreaming up the future of cities will have to consider.
In New York, the unwritten rule is plain: Cross the street whenever and wherever, just don't get hit. It's a practice that separates New Yorkers from tourists, who innocently wait at the corner for the walk symbol. But if pedestrians know they'll never be run over, jaywalking could explode, grinding traffic to a halt.
One solution, suggested by an automotive industry official, is gates at each corner, which would periodically open to allow pedestrians to cross.
That prospect seems as likely as never-late subways. But it's an example of the thinking by those who worry about planning for the future.
"With autonomous vehicles, the technical stuff will get worked out. It's the societal part that's the most challenging," said Mark Rosekind, a head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration under President Barack Obama and now the chief safety innovation officer for Zoox, an autonomous vehicle developer.
The variables are almost limitless. While Manhattan poses a pedestrian problem, California's highways raise another.
The solution may be to program vehicles based on the local customs. In California, keeping up with the flow of freeway traffic typically means driving 10 to 15 mph over the posted limit, whereas drivers in some parts of the East stay much closer to the legal speed (emphasis on some).
Self-driving cars represent "the single-most transformative societal change in decades," Rosekind said. "We have to be ready for it."
We're not.
How society will adjust, or what we can do to mitigate cultural upheavals, is just beginning to be discussed. Today, there are few answers.
Autonomous vehicles are classified by six levels, from zero to five. Fully autonomous, Level 5, vehicles will not be available for 10 years or longer, Rosekind believes, and only after they've been tested for billions, not the current millions, of miles.
But a Level 4 autonomous car that can completely drive itself under certain circumstances will come to market in five years or less, experts say. And that makes the formulation of new rules for cities and citizens imperative.
Those rules are being contemplated by such organizations as the Society for Automotive Engineers, university transportation departments and Partners for Automated Vehicle Education, a recently formed industry and academic coalition that is conducting autonomous vehicle demo days, workshops and other activities.
The federal government, while supporting the effort, is not leading the charge. An administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said local officials should tailor any guidelines.
While news media attention has recently focused on the handful of deaths caused by autonomous vehicles, education is needed to convince people that the self-driving cars will be much safer than today's cars and trucks, which kill more than 30,000 people every year in the United States, Rosekind said.
"It's going to be a mosh pit for the next 30 years," said Gregory Winfree, director of the Texas A&M Transportation Institute and a former assistant secretary at the Transportation Department.
"The question is how we operate collaboratively when we have a mix of self-driving and manually driven vehicles," he said. "What will happen when both approach a yellow light and the AV slows down but the driver of the regular vehicle wants to speed up? From Day 1, we have the potential for conflict."
Autonomous vehicles could be designed to never exceed the speed limit except in emergencies, resulting in a sharp drop in traffic tickets - and revenue. Or local governments could mandate that a such a car's software be programmed to stay within certain speed limits or stay off residential streets that are now used as freeway-avoiding shortcuts.
Cars could be programmed to drive aggressively as well as conservatively, depending on the owner. But if two "conservative" vehicles meet at an intersection, which one will finally decide to cross the roadway?
The problems will be worst when autonomous and manually driven vehicles occupy the same roads; will a driver try to outwit a self-driving vehicle or will that car always have the advantage?
Given that vehicles are typically kept for close to 12 years, it will be decades before the majority of the 278 million standard vehicles - and their independent and unpredictable drivers - are off U.S. roads.
Until then, it's possible that self-driving cars will need their own lanes, to avoid mixing it up with cars driven by humans, whose errors now account for 94% of vehicle crashes.
Other potential changes include a reduction in the need for parking lots, once autonomous cars can simply park themselves anywhere or circle around until they're needed. Architects are working on parking lot designs that can be repurposed into offices.
And cities will need to find new sources of revenue if an autonomous vehicle can drive away from a parking meter once it expires or never park at all.
Some of the safety issues are expected to be mitigated by the inclusion of vehicle-to-vehicle, and vehicle-to-infrastructure, communications, technology that will allow one vehicle or traffic light to tell another vehicle where it is and what it is about to do. This so-called V2X technology is beginning to appear in some models, but the federal government will not mandate its use.
The administration official said the government would not force the issue.
How an autonomous vehicle behaves will be of concern not just to drivers but to manufacturers and insurance companies. "If the automaker is ultimately responsible for an autonomous vehicle's behavior, then they will want it to act conservatively," Winfree said.
Within the next several months, the Society of Automotive Engineers expects to have formulated a list of autonomous-vehicle standards. They include autonomous testing protocols for drivers as well as the standardization of the placement of emergency stop buttons, the action that should be taken in case of an emergency and the type of warning that pedestrians should receive when an autonomous vehicle is approaching.
Industry executives expect that in the next few years, the public will begin to see self-driving vehicles operating in limited environments, such as people movers and delivery vehicles. (Lyft is testing self-driving vehicles in Las Vegas and Phoenix, with a human backup ready to take the wheel.) Their hope is that public sentiment toward autonomous cars will become more positive thanks to education efforts and once people can buy them.

Texto completo: Madison Paper Industries has 30 days to appeal the decision, but its lawyer, Jonathan A. Block, has not received indication of the company's plans to do so as of Monday afternoon.

MADISON — A shuttered paper mill’s tax abatement request of over $1 million has been formally rejected by the state’s tax review board, according to a decision handed down Thursday.
Madison’s Town Manager Tim Curtis said the outcome, which was first announced in April, is welcome news for residents. Since Madison Paper Industries — which closed three years ago — filed the abatement request in 2017, the town drew over $500,000 from a line of credit and budgeted about $400,000 from taxpayers to help cover the potential costs had the decision gone the other way. It has since paid off the loan and — with voter approval at a Town Meeting in June — decided to apply the $400,000 to a handful of capital projects rather than put it toward reducing this year’s taxes.
Those projects, Curtis noted, include road repairs and the purchase of equipment for highways and the fire department.
Jonathan A. Block, the lawyer representing Madison Paper Industries, said Monday afternoon that he had not heard from the company about whether it wanted to appeal the decision. The group has 30 days to do so.
“This written response is good for us going forward because there’s a (limited) window for Madison Paper Industries to appeal,” Curtis said. “We don’t know whether they will appeal this decision, but we will know within 30 days.”
Madison Paper Industries, which supplied the New York Times with supercalendered paper used for advertising inserts, shut down operations in May 2016 and sold the mill property to Greg Shain of Somerset Acquisitions for $2 million in Dec. 2016. In April 2016, when the town made its tax assessments, representatives of Madison Paper Industries argued that the property should be valued as liquidated because of the company’s announced intention to close later in the year. Both the town and state appeals board considered that logic “unpersuasive.”
“On April 1, 2016, the mill, as then used, was producing paper and operating unrestrictedly in the black,” the state decision, handed down Aug. 1, reads. “A gas pipeline recently had been put in place, and the owners had been successful in securing the imposition of a tariff on the importation of Canadian paper that competed with the SC paper produced on the premises by MPI. The property was considered ‘state of the art’, and neither the NYT or UPM (MPI’s partner owners) was in financial difficulty.”
Madison’s Board of Assessors had already agreed to depreciate the mill assets by $8 million in 2016 due to “economic obsolescence” on top of approving a $123.8 million reduction in its valuation two years prior to that. While the town board opted to assess the mill assets in 2016 at $38,070,181, Madison Paper Industries pursued a $2,265,000 valuation. The town’s tax rate for 2016 was $21 per $1,000 of assessed value.
“We’re very pleased that the state board listened to the town and understood our point that when Madison Paper Industries announced in March 2016 that it would be closing, it didn’t justify a liquidation value on their property,” Curtis said.
The paper company also sought an assessment of $31,787,000 for that part of the company’s two hydroelectric dams sited in Madison that with the Anson dam provided 40% of the Madison mill’s energy. Officials had valued that property at $34,292,500 in 2016. The state board rejected the paper company’s request for a lower valuation on its hydro property because it did not deviate more than 10% from the municipality’s assessment, as is required by state law to prove substantial overvaluation.
In the meantime, the former paper mill site has changed hands again, with Belfast company GO Lab Inc. closing on the property next week, according to Curtis. The new owner plans to redevelop the site into a manufacturing hub for wood fiber insulation, bringing 100 jobs with it. Madison Paper Industries had employed 214 people when it shut down in 2016.

Texto completo: George Church, the prominent Harvard University biologist, offered a full-throated apology for having meetings and phone calls with accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein even after the financier pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting a minor for prostitution.
“I certainly apologize for my poor awareness and judgment," Church told STAT in his first public comments about Epstein.
Expressing regret that he and other scientists weren't more cautious in their dealings with Epstein, he said: “There should have been more conversations about, 'Should we be doing this, should we be helping this guy?' There was just a lot of nerd tunnel vision."
He added, “My main concern is for the people who have been hurt," the girls and young women Epstein was accused last month of having brought to his Manhattan and Palm Beach, Fla., homes for sex (a charge Epstein denies).
Since the indictment last month, news reports have described numerous meetings Epstein organized, both before and after his 2008 conviction, with physicists, biologists, mathematicians, and other researchers. He seemed to believe his interactions with scientists, especially those at Harvard, would buff his reputation in the financial world, saying on his website that he had “the privilege of sponsoring many prominent scientists."
Asked how so many of them could have associated with Epstein after his guilty plea and 13-month sentence, Church said that scientists “might not have realized the enormity of his transgressions," especially since Epstein seemed to be welcomed back into society after he served his sentence. “That's my most generous interpretation."
In addition, he said, scientists are as vulnerable to flattery and attention from prominent people as anyone. “If it's a rich person [asking about their research], that's cool," Church said. “Or if it's a politician or a movie star, [scientists] would be flattered if they took time out of their own activities to learn something about quasars or recombinant DNA."
As for whether Epstein's 2008 conviction gave Church (a father and grandfather) pause, he said, “I did read a couple of news articles" a decade ago, he said, “but they weren't clear enough for me to know there was a serious problem.
“But that is still no excuse for me not being abreast of the news."
Church said he is used to financiers, technologists, and celebrities seeking him out, and has become a quasi-celebrity himself. But Church also has unquestioned scientific gravitas, having helped develop genome sequencing as well as CRISPR genome editing, and founded or advised dozens of biotech companies.
Now, Church is the only science luminary to publicly apologize for interactions with Epstein.
Many influential scientists met Epstein through New York literary agent John Brockman, who, starting in 1999, hosted an annual “billionaires dinner" where some of his authors mingled with moguls. Epstein attended several of the dinners from 2000 to 2011, and Brockman described him on his online salon Edge.org as a “science philanthropist."
Church, whose 2012 book “Regenesis" was shepherded by Brockman, said he met Epstein in 2006, either through Brockman or through the then-chairman of the Harvard psychology department, Stephen Kosslyn, a member of Edge.org.
He confirmed NBC's recent report that he had six phone calls and meetings with Epstein in 2014, as shown in Church's online calendar (he has posted one every year since 1999). Sample entry: “Jun 21, 2014 Lunch w/ Jeffrey Epstein, 12-1:30, Martin Nowak's Institute." (Nowak, a Harvard biologist/mathematician, is also a Brockman client and Edge participant. He also met with Epstein “several times" each year since, Church said. (Brockman and Nowak could not be reached for comment over the weekend.)
Asked what interested Epstein about Church's work, Church paused before saying, “I don't think he picked me. So in that sense he may not have been that interested."
Instead, many of his meetings with Epstein were with Nowak, to whose then-fledgling Program for Evolutionary Dynamics Epstein contributed $6.5 million in 2003, five years before his guilty plea. Church and Nowak have worked together on, among other things, the evolution of CRISPR-based gene drives. At the get-togethers with Nowak, Church said, Epstein seemed interested in the science of life's origins and mathematically modeling the evolution of viruses, cancer cells, and life itself.
Church knew nothing about Epstein's interest in eugenics in the early 2000s, he said. According to The New York Times, Epstein hoped that multiple women would be inseminated with his sperm. Church has done boundary-pushing research on “recoding life" (to, among other things, make cells resistant to viruses) and argued that making heritable changes in the genomes of embryos should not be off the table, which might have made him a sounding board for eugenic fantasies.
But “I never heard anything about it," Church said. “I'd have thought that I would have been involved in that kind of conversation, but it didn't tend to go in that direction. But also, I think people tend to behave themselves around me."
A longtime associate of Church seemed surprised that he became involved with Epstein, since Church has prioritized ethics. (The associate declined to be named in a story about Epstein.) Church invited a philosopher to work in his lab to flag bioethics issues in experiments, and for years has taught a research ethics course, which is unusual for someone of his prominence.
Universities are supposed to vet potential donors who ask to meet with faculty members. But Epstein did not offer to fund Church's research, so Harvard did not get involved. “Instead, a lot of [Epstein's interactions] with me happened through Martin [Nowak]'s institute, and the university was well aware of that connection" because of Epstein's $6.5 million donation, Church said.
“My understanding is this [vetting] is the responsibility of the development office, which is yet another reason why scientists are a little bit more relaxed. They feel they have administrators, who in theory do the difficult job of figuring out who's legit, who's actually going to write a check, if you're going to spend hours talking to somebody."
But that happens only if the request “is anything financial or contractual," Church said, not if it's lunch or a phone call. That was up to Church.
Scientists, “myself included, are not very good" at screening out people, he said. “I think many of them also feel an exceptionalism," meaning they should be allowed to associate with anyone if it is for a greater good. He recalled how in the 1990s, renowned molecular biologist and Nobel laureate Sydney Brenner, who died in April at age 92, defended the $15 million he accepted from cigarette giant Philip Morris for a biology institute in California that he had founded, arguing that basic science was a better cause than other uses the company might have for its millions.
Did Church believe Epstein had “paid his debt to society" in 2008 and deserved another chance? “As far as I know people just didn't have that conversation," Church said. “But it should have."
Scientists' feeling that they cannot be morally tainted by their associations “may not be rational, or helpful, or correct," Church allowed. Still, he added, “I would like to think that people's reputation is multidimensional and multiyear — that it takes a long time to build up but also to tear down." He was speaking both generally and about himself.

Texto completo: The more we learn, the more Jeffrey Epstein resembles an evil comic book character for the developmentally arrested intellectual - the charming-but-lurid mastermind with a plot to take over the world by impregnating scores of women on a remote desert estate.
Last Wednesday, the New York Times reported that the financier/convicted sex offender/philanthropist - and now accused sex trafficker - is also a "transhumanist," who had big plans for humankind. Epstein apparently told one scientist that he hoped to seed the human race with his own DNA by impregnating 20 women at a time at his New Mexico ranch, named "Zorro."
Transhumanism is the theory that the human population can be enhanced through technologies such as artificial intelligence and genetic engineering. Or eugenics by any other name. Epstein seems to have believed that he was that rare breed who ought to be replicated.
The carriers of Epstein's apparently rarefied spermatozoa wouldn't be the younger, underage sexual partners he allegedly prefers. Instead, according to the Times' reporting, his maternal vehicles would be adult women whose intellectual qualifications would have been established through academic achievement.
For salon dinners he hosted at his Manhattan manse, Epstein often invited scientists as well as a sampling of attractive, accomplished women. Some of the scientists theorized that the women were being vetted as potential candidates for Epstein's very special black book, according to the Times.
One can only imagine the conversations at such soirees: So, Penelope, what do you think of transhumanism? Oh, you do? And how do you like the desert air?
The male invitees weren't your run-of-the-mill scientists but were some of the most renowned, innovative minds in research and academia. Among them was Steven Pinker, the Harvard cognitive psychologist and popular science author, who seems to have seen through Epstein, calling him an "intellectual impostor." Pinker told the Times that Epstein would abruptly shift topics and make juvenile remarks. To the layman's eye, such behavior suggests a purposeful deflection when the topic at hand is reaching a point beyond the speaker's comfort range.
Others on Epstein's guest lists apparently were seduced by his charm and intellect, as well as his wealth, which he reportedly dangled as bait for funding-starved researchers. He was generous, often donating to a variety of interests and causes, including the Clinton Foundation. But he wasn't convinced that helping the starving masses was productive in the right sense, arguing that providing food and health care to the poor would only heighten the risk of overpopulation.
Pinker, who said he was present when Epstein floated this idea at a gathering at Harvard, dissented, arguing that the evidence points to the contrary. Gods don't like to be contradicted and Pinker was thereafter told he'd been "voted off the island" and banished from future gatherings.
Speaking of which, Epstein's private island in the Caribbean - which he dubs "Little St. Jeff's" - is of renewed interest thanks to an NBC News report last week. Apparently, a blue-and-white striped, block-shaped building on it bears no resemblance to the octagonally shaped design that had been approved for a music hall, according to permit records.
What the structure does resemble, however, is a pharaoh's headdress. Might this have been intended as a mausoleum for Epstein's remains? That is, other than his head and penis, which he reportedly wished to have frozen. Also a fan of cryogenics, believing that frozen human parts and bodies could be resurrected in the future, Epstein is no ordinary bloke. Indeed, he is a perversely tragic figure.
Burdened with supra-human fantasies and the means to explore them, it seems that Epstein became lost in his own fable. Wandering the skies in his private jet, enamored of his own mind and image, he forgot that he was merely mortal and may have flown too close to the sun. Confined now to a jail cell (with further punishment perhaps to come) - and removed from his luxurious kingdom, his freedom and the company of luminaries who suffused his ego with admiration - his suffering must be immense.
And so richly deserved.

Texto completo: LANSING – Gov. Gretchen Whitmer appeared to support a change in state law to issue driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants, when she gave an impromptu interview to an immigrants rights organization during the Democratic presidential debates in Detroit.
"We need to ensure that everyone's got a path to getting a license, so they've got identification," Whitmer, a Democrat, said in a video released by the group Movimiento Cosecha after an organizer for the group asked her if she favored issuing driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants.
"That's something that's important to me, it's important to our economy, and it's important to the people of Michigan."
Michigan passed legislation to ban the practice in 2008 after Attorney General Mike Cox, a Republican, issued a formal opinion in 2007 saying undocumented immigrants could not obtain driver's licenses. Cox's opinion reversed a 1995 opinion from former Attorney General Frank Kelley, a Democrat.
Tiffany Brown, a spokeswoman for Whitmer, would not answer directly Friday morning when asked whether Whitmer favors changing state law to allow undocumented immigrants to hold Michigan driver's licenses. But she did not deny the accuracy of the video and transcript released by Movimiento Cosecha.
"Not sure I'll have much more to add outside of what the governor said in the video about ensuring that undocumented immigrants have a path to getting an ID," Brown said in an email.
She did not specify what that path would look like or whether she was talking about a state identification other than a driver's license. In the video, Whitmer specifically referenced driver's licenses for undocumented immigrants.
A dozen states, including Illinois and California, plus the District of Columbia issue driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants.
Proponents say allowing undocumented immigrants to hold driver's licenses would help Michigan's economy by making it easier for them work and pay taxes. They say it also would enable them to avoid being detained and deported in many cases, since a major reason for being detained is failing to produce a valid driver's license.
Opponents say the practice raises national security concerns and rewards those who do not observe all immigration requirements at the expense of those who do.
Republicans generally oppose licenses for undocumented immigrants, while Democrats are split on the issue.
In a statement on Twitter Friday, Michigan Senate Republicans said the entire chamber, including then Sen. Whitmer, voted unanimously in 2008 to withhold driver's licenses from "anyone in our state illegally."
"Gov. Whitmer should listen to Sen. Whitmer," the statement said.
Whitmer stepped into the contentious debate at the same time she has counseled Democratic presidential candidates to avoid veering too far to the left and to focus on "dinner table" issues such as wages and education. For example, in an interview with the New York Times, she was critical of instances in the first Democratic debate in Miami when candidates raised their hands to questions such as whether free health care should be provided to undocumented immigrants.
Brown, the governor's spokeswoman, said there is no inconsistency.
"This was simply the governor responding to a question from a constituent," she said.
Whitmer said in the interview with Movimiento Cosecha that Michigan fortunately has a secretary of state and an attorney general who "feel the same way" about the issue that she does.
Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson "has met with community leaders and legislators and stands with the governor in support of changing the law so that all individuals working and residing in our state may obtain a state ID or a driver's license for use in Michigan," said spokesman Michael Doyle.
Attorney General Dana Nessel, a Democrat, supports issuing driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants, spokeswoman Kelly Rossman-McKinney said Friday.
Members of Movimiento Cosecha were arrested this week when they blocked the entrance to the Detroit-Windsor tunnel in an effort to raise awareness of immigration issues during the Democratic debates.
Dominique Leon Becerra, the group organizer who spoke to and recorded Whitmer, said they plan to make sure the governor follows through.
"No empty promises," she said in a news release. "We need to see real results and a plan to make driver's licenses accessible to our community now!"
The Michigan Catholic Conference has long supported issuing driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants "as a matter of human dignity and the reality that transportation is necessary to get people to the places they need to be," said spokesman David Maluchnik.

American peerage on display in extraordinary saga of wealth

Texto completo: Janny Scott's saga "The Beneficiary" scrutinizes prosperity, privilege, and pathos.
Scott's family is Philadelphia Main Line nobility, enjoying fortunes derived from finance and railroads. Great-great-grandfather Thomas Scott was President of the Pennsylvania Railroad. Great-grandfather Colonel Robert Montgomery was the great-grandson of a man who "invested in property in New Orleans, the value of which had skyrocketed after the Louisiana Purchase." The Colonel's financial acumen replenished the Montgomery fortune, which was waning by the time of his birth.
The Colonel built a baronial home, Ardrossan, and tied subsequent generations to it, through trusts and through imposing homes on the estate, available to family members at low cost. The Colonel thought that his intentions would cement cohesion instead of causing claustrophobia and creating dysfunctional heirs alongside others who could not escape quickly enough.
The extended family's wrestling with its legacy elicits laughs alongside sympathy for the pain occasioned by their constrained circumstances. Tropes of enduring Southern literature and drama endlessly evidence themselves: Aristocratic airs abound. Drinking and suicide surface. War dead intrude. William Faulkner and Tennessee Williams composed no more compelling narrative.
The family possesses the requisite family plantation, in South Carolina, for hunting, as well as a Belle Époque Summer "Cottage" in Bar Harbor, Maine. Novelists and playwrights have failed to realize such a treasure of rich material, not that no one has tried:
Philip Barry supposedly modeled Tracy Lord in "The Philadelphia Story" upon Scott's grandmother Helen Hope Montgomery Scott—played by Katharine Hepburn onscreen. The shadow side of the inheritance bequeathed suggests Mary Tyrone—portrayed by Hepburn—in Eugene O'Neill's "A Long Day's Journey Into Night." Other films in which class and caste create continuity include "Giant", "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof", "Guess Who's Coming To Dinner?"—again featuring Hepburn—and "Crazy, Rich Asians".
F. Scott Fitzgerald's famous 1926 story "The Rich Boy" identified our fascination with the wealthy this way:
"Let me tell you about the very rich. They are different from you and me. They possess and enjoy early, and it does something to them, makes them soft where we are hard, and cynical where we are trustful, in a way that, unless you were born rich, it is very difficult to understand. They think, deep in their hearts, that they are better than we are because we had to discover the compensations and refuges of life for ourselves."
The reality is that wealth insulates only from consequences and deprivation and not from the trauma and travails of human existence. Largesse sometimes creates unreality, suggesting mistaken envy of what might entail greater cost than benefit.
Scott's story is riveting, because the shortcomings shown are actual human tragedy, rather than the invention of fiction. The cognoscenti who enthusiastically read "The Beneficiary" cannot sufficiently praise Scott for evaluating her extended family's exaggerated enthusiasms and eccentricities. Scott's years reporting for The New York Times allow for skillful dissection of details which might otherwise have been imponderable.
Much has been made of the demise of venerable English Manor Houses after World War II. Discussion of money, breeding, and blood in the United States—paralleling Debrett's Peerage in England—is more taboo than sex, given the country's refusal to reference economic inequality, historically. Scott's comfort in considering how Robber Barons' estates, fortunes, and families fared could be her signature achievement.
Anachronism is arguably the most authentically Southern Gothic element in "The Beneficiary": A family retainer recalled the family estate as "... the craziest place... Because there were so many people doing nothing. They kept a culture alive when it should have been dead and gone." Scott's father said of his mother, "She was 'trying to keep something so anachronistic alive because it was so beautiful.... She was treasuring something that was going, gone.'"

Texto completo: Misplacing your car keys is worrisome, but it's nothing like the free-fall panic of losing your phone. Hollywood could make a horror movie about somebody just looking for their iPhone XR and going slowly insane.
The telephone began to pervade our lives at the end of the 19th century, and then -- as you can see in these photos from The New York Times's archives -- it became our lives. Cellphones were a significant inflection point. They made it possible for us to be available at virtually any moment, which was so extraordinary that most of us tacitly accepted that we should be available at virtually any moment.
History's first call on a hand-held wireless phone was made on April 3, 1973, by a Motorola executive named Martin Cooper. Mr. Cooper had developed the phone himself and, having a cheeky streak, decided to step out onto Sixth Avenue, in Midtown Manhattan, and call his rival at Bell Laboratories to gloat a little. Can you hear me now?
Told recently that his call was a great P.R. stunt, Mr. Cooper, who turned 90 last year, said: "Remember, this was the first public call ever made and I only cared about one thing: Was the phone going to work? This thing was a handmade prototype -- thousands of parts carefully wired together by an engineer, not a production guy -- and there were only two in existence."
In the first photo here, Mr. Cooper's mentor, John F. Mitchell, shows off the brand-new DynaTAC. "The Brick," as it became known, went on sale in 1983 for $ 3,995 (more than $ 10,000 in today's dollars). It weighed about two pounds and took 10 hours to charge. On top of that, you could talk for only 20 minutes before it went dead. In 1987, however, the DynaTAC became a symbol for the liberating power of money when Michael Douglas walked along a Hamptons beach in his bathrobe in "Wall Street" and stoked Charlie Sheen's greed: "I'm gonna make you rich, Bud Fox. Yeah, rich enough you can afford a girl like Darien. This is your wake-up call, pal. Go to work."
What did Mr. Cooper say back in the day when critics predicted that availability would be a curse?
"My first response was, 'Well, we do have an on/off switch on every phone. You don't have to answer it,"' he said. "But my more profound response is that the cellphone is still really new in society. I have an overweening belief in the intelligence of people. We are going to figure out how to communicate with other people and live complete and wholesome lives. Yes, I'm concerned, but if you think about all the other distractions -- somehow humanity has managed to survive. When the TV first came out, I spent hours watching wrestling."
Mr. Cooper believes the good that cell technology can do -- spark productivity, enfranchise the poor -- far outstrips any downsides. He always buys the latest iPhone, though he gives the phones mixed reviews: extraordinary in terms of tech, but needlessly complicated from a consumer point of view.
Reminded that even his own DynaTAC "Brick" had drawbacks, Mr. Cooper laughed. He said he always tells people it was never a problem that the battery lasted only around 20 minutes -- the phone was so heavy that nobody could hold it up longer than that anyway.

Texto completo: I've lost count how many hotels I've stayed in. Hundreds, for sure, and on every continent except Antarctica. From beach-side resorts in St. Kitts to a grand, soaring high-rise in Tokyo, to a castle-adjacent treehouse on the north coast of Scotland, I've stayed in some truly lovely places. I've also stayed at dilapidated dives in Vegas with rusty faucets and rugs so thin you could see the concrete underneath. The memory of the latter still makes me itch.
Over the years I've come up with a set of tips and tricks I use in every hotel, from 5-star to wear-your-shoes-in-the-bathroom-star. They range from a little peace of mind and a reduction of annoyance to maintaining a bit of safety and health while traveling. Starting with ...
The remote is gross
What is touched by everyone but rarely cleaned? A quick swipe with some baby wipes or a damp (not wet) hand towel should help a bit.
20°C is 68°F
Need to set the thermostat in your room anywhere outside the US? Twenty degrees is a good place to start.
Be skeptical of drinking glasses, especially if the hotel lacks a restaurant
Generally, drinking glasses are cleaned after every guest. Generally. If there's no on-site restaurant, though, how are they cleaned? By hand presumably, but how well? Give them a rinse and a sniff, at least.
Don't put your luggage on the bed
Bed bugs are gross little vampires. Like mosquitoes, but worse. Putting your luggage on the bed can give them a free ride to your next location ... like your house. The luggage rack might not be a good option either, since it's usually close to the bed. Your best bet is to put your luggage in the bathroom and then give the bed, rack, and chair/sofa a close look. Also, don't assume that just because hotel is super posh it won't have bed bugs. They might have more means to get rid of the problem, but it can happen anywhere.
Long cables for your phone, or a travel power strip
As the number of devices needing to charge increases, the number of outlets available in hotel rooms ... stays the same. I've stayed in new hotels with zero easily-accessible plugs. Mind blowing. Wirecutter, the New York Times company that reviews products, has options for long Micro-USB, Lightning, and USB-C cables so you can plug in and still, hopefully, use your phone from the bed. They also have a pick for a travel power strips so you can plug multiple devices into that one outlet you found behind the bed.
Yes, you can take the little shampoo bottles. No, you can't take the robe.
Some hotels give the remaining soaps to charities like Clean the World. It's worth checking if they do, as perhaps that's a better use of the remaining soap than getting lost in your luggage or forgotten in your home medicine cabinet. Many hotels are moving toward large-bottle dispensers, both as a cost- and Earth-saving measure.
Lock, latch, and put out the do not disturb sign
Housekeeping comes early. Exactly 100 percent of the time I've wanted to sleep in and forgot to put out the sign, housekeeping wakes me up. In how many languages do you know how to say "come back later, please?" For me, when woken from a deep slumber, a croaky none.
Enabling the safety latch also lets you open the door to see if it really is management knocking while preventing said knocker from unexpectedly opening the door fully. Exceptionally unlikely, sure, but why take the chance?
Take a picture of the safe code
Even if you just use your birthday or something memorable in the moment, take a picture of the number you program into the safe.
Laundry is expensive
I travel for months at a time. I do laundry about once a week. At an expensive laundromat in Paris I paid 7 euros, or about $ 10, for a load of all my clothes. While trapped at a hotel in Fiji during a typhoon I paid $ 10 for each pair of underwear.
You should definitely pack light enough that you'll need to do laundry on any trip longer than a week. Some hotels, and nearly all hostels, have inexpensive laundry facilities on-site or nearby. The staff will usually help you find a place. There's always washing in the sink too, which is free if you have the time.
And lastly ... Stay in a hostel instead
I've spent the majority of nights during my extended travels of the last 5 years in hostels. Hotels can be great, but they're invariably expensive. Hostels probably aren't what you think, and can be a great way to save money and meet new people.

An estate planning lawyer’s approach to blended families

Texto completo: This is part three in a series of five articles discussing the following case hypothetical from the various professional perspectives:
A and B are getting married. A has two kids from a previous marriage. B has one child from a prior marriage. They plan to have children together. A receives child support from a former spouse. A’s mother also lives with them and helps care for the children. B’s only child works in B’s business and both A and B hope their joint child(ren) will one day join the business as well. A and B have a lot to discuss!
The first thing I would tell A and B about their estate planning is “don’t try to plan for the next 20 years right now.” Trying to plan for too many “what ifs” can cause analysis paralysis. The best practice is to get a plan in place that addresses the “what ifs” of the next three to five years. That’s particularly true for A and B — newlyweds with a newly blended family. That’s why trusts are living documents — they need to be reviewed and adjusted over time as families, circumstances and laws change.
As long as you remain competent and alive, you can amend your trust. And if you don’t, well, you’ve put the right plan in place at the right time.
Currently, there are minor children involved. Were A to pass away, A may want or need to plan for the support and care of the children rather than B, who is likely self-sufficient and not dependent on A’s support at this early stage in their relationship. Later, when A’s children are grown and gone, A is more likely to want or need to provide for B.
B currently has to think about B’s business. In the event of B’s death, B may want to see B’s child carry on the business. If A needs an income stream from B’s estate however, an outright transfer of the business might not work. B’s options would include keeping the business owned by a trust with income paid to A, but with B’s child still running the business and getting a salary. Or, perhaps B can obtain life insurance that would pay to A and allow the business to be transferred to his child.
Life insurance or some other income stream (retirement plans, annuities, etc.) of B are useful here. If A is significantly younger than B, or close in age to B’s child, and B plans to provide for A first, then B’s child, there could be tension. A plan that has a child “waiting around for step-parent to die” can be an invitation to discord (witness the step-parent vs. children disputes of celebrities like Casey Kasem, Robin Williams and Glen Campbell).
If B has a stream of income that can be directed to either B’s child or A with the remaining assets going to the other of them, that can reduce tension. This may give the best hope for a continuing relationship between a child and a step-parent.
In the event of A’s death or incapacity, does the surviving biological parent (e.g. A’s ex-spouse) have custody of the minor children? If so, A may not be able to plan for B’s involvement with the children, but perhaps leaving money in trust with B as the trustee will at least assure some contact and oversight. If not, A will need to carefully consider whether A’s mother or B should be named guardian of the children.
At a minimum, A will want to get powers of attorney and health care directives for minors that allow for A’s mother and B to take care of the children in an emergency, including making health care decisions for the children if A is not able to.
If A and B should die together, who gets what and when requires careful analysis.
A’s children are younger than B’s one child, and if they have additional children in the future, the age gap will be greater. A and B can consider a “common trust” that holds all assets in one trust for the benefit of all children until the youngest child reaches a certain age or graduates from college.
The trustee makes distribution for “health, education, support and maintenance” of all the children, but is not required to do so equally. This gives the youngest child the same advantages as the older children for whom college, a car, perhaps a wedding, was already paid for prior to their parents’ passing.
When the youngest child reaches the stated age, the trust can be divided into shares for the children and distributed outright or over time when each child hits a certain age. The size of those shares is another area for discussion.
Does B’s child get half and A’s children split the other half? If A and B have a child together does that child get a portion of each half? The short-term answer is likely to be much different than the answer 20 years from now.
The decisions to be made will necessarily take into consideration whether there is a large disparity between the assets of A and B, and there are many formulas and approaches to deciding what’s “fair.”
I would say to A and B what I often say to my clients: This may be the first time you’ve had to design your estate plan, but your lawyer has done hundreds if not thousands of plans. No matter how complicated you may think your family is, it’s our job to help you figure out what works for your family, to provide some options for you, and get it all documented.
Then A and B can concentrate on the fun parts of their upcoming Brady Bunch life together. And I’d also say congratulations! And best wishes! And I’ll see you again in three to five years.

High profile cases of misconduct continue to hamper Navy SEALs

Texto completo: The top Navy SEAL has given commanders until Wednesday to report back to him with recommendations on how to fix ethical and credibility issues facing the elite naval special warfare community following several high profile incidents of misconduct.
"We have a problem," Rear Adm. Collin Green wrote in a letter addressed to the secretive force.
Green, who leads Naval Special Warfare Command, did not single out a particular incident but implied that the erosion of the public's trust is at stake.
The letter, first reported Thursday by CNN, is dated July 25, the day after the U.S. Special Operations Command announced that a platoon of San Diego-based SEALs was sent home from Iraq "due to a perceived deterioration of good order and discipline within the team during non-operational periods." The New York Times reported that those SEALs are being investigated for sexual assault and unauthorized alcohol use.
Also, in late July, the Navy Times reported that members of the Virginia Beach-based SEAL Team 10 used cocaine and cheated on drug tests during a scandal that came to light in 2018. Four SEALs were administratively separated following the incident, and a fifth was cleared of wrongdoing. A sixth SEAL, a petty officer third class who had tested positive for cocaine, committed suicide in his home in May 2018, according to an investigation obtained by The Virginian-Pilot.
Those reports also followed dramatic courtroom sagas involving SEALs that have played out in recent months. Eddie Gallagher was acquitted on murder charges but demoted from chief to petty officer first class after being found guilty by a military jury in San Diego last month of posing for a photo with a dead Islamic State prisoner. This week, the Navy dismissed charges against Gallagher's platoon commander, Lt. Jacob Portier.
In May, Chief Special Warfare Operator Adam Matthews, a member of the Virginia Beach-based SEAL Team 6, pleaded guilty at a special court martial at Naval Station Norfolk for his involvement in the 2017 hazing death of Army Green Beret Staff Sgt. Logan Melgar in Mali. Matthews was sentenced to a year of confinement and a bad conduct discharge. Chief Special Warfare Operator Tony DeDolph and Gunnery Sgt. Mario Madera-Rodriguez, a Marine Raider, are scheduled to appear in a preliminary hearing in the case at the naval station Monday.
"I don't know yet if we have a culture problem, I do know that we have a good order and discipline problem that must be addressed immediately," Green wrote.
Green also assigned some mandatory reading: the first two chapters of former SEAL Dick Couch's 2010 book, "A Tactical Ethic," about battlefield ethics.
Naval Special Warfare Command Group 2 spokesman Lt. Katie Koenig declined to comment Friday. Group 2 oversees East Coast-based SEAL teams 2, 4, 8 and 10 as well as support units.

American Kidney Fund Denied Aid for Smaller Clinics, Suit Claims

Texto completo: One of the nation's largest public charities steered financial aid to patients of its two biggest corporate donors -- the dialysis chains DaVita and Fresenius -- while denying help to people who used smaller, unrelated clinics, in violation of anti-kickback laws, according to a federal whistle-blower lawsuit unsealed this week in Boston.
The charity, the American Kidney Fund, helps patients who need dialysis by paying their health insurance premiums and other costs for treatment. But under a longstanding federal agreement intended to prevent illegal kickbacks, the charity is supposed to provide help based solely on a patient's financial need, and not favor companies that donate to it.
The lawsuit, filed by David Gonzalez, who worked for 12 years at the kidney fund in its patient assistance program until he left in 2015, accused the charity of creating a so-called blocked list of dialysis clinics whose patients would not get financial assistance while making sure patients at clinics operated by DaVita and Fresenius would.
The Justice Department, which had earlier issued subpoenas regarding the accusations, said it would not join the case. But it requested that the court seek the department's consent if a decision were reached to dismiss or settle the lawsuit. Some cases that did not involve federal prosecutors have still led to large settlements, including one in which Celgene agreed to pay $ 280 million to settle claims it had inappropriately marketed the cancer drugs Thalomid and Revlimid.
In a statement, LaVarne A. Burton, president of the American Kidney Fund, said the group was pleased that the Justice Department had declined to intervene and said it had cooperated fully in the case. "We now know that this suit was brought by a former employee who, prior to making this complaint, was terminated for cause," she said. The fund adheres to the federal agreement that governs its charitable program, she added.
"The Department of Justice has looked at this matter and decided not to pursue any action against DaVita," the company said in a statement.
Fresenius declined to comment. A lawyer for Mr. Gonzalez did not return a request for comment.

Fresenius and DaVita control about 70 percent of the market. The accusations against the big dialysis chains have become public just a few weeks after the Trump administration called for a shift away from the care provided in dialysis clinics to kidney transplants or in-home dialysis.
The allegations in the lawsuit mirror the findings of a 2016 report in The New York Times about the fund. Representative Katie Porter, a California Democrat, recently requested that the Office of Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services, the federal agency that created the original guidelines for the charity, investigate the charity's activities. A spokeswoman for the agency said it would not comment.
The lawsuit, filed in 2016, says the charity went to great lengths to ensure no aid was given to patients at clinics that were not donors. Mr. Gonzalez said in his lawsuit that the charity began formally tracking donors in 2009, labeling those clinics that did not contribute as "free riders."
When the charity was criticized for its use of a "blocked list" of clinics, it changed the name to "training list," according to the lawsuit. The charity would contact these clinics to request donations in specific amounts, calculated by looking at the payments made to patients at these clinics.
When one patient moved from a Fresenius clinic in Florida to a clinic in Indianapolis, the fund initially stopped paying the patient's premiums, according to the lawsuit, because the new clinic had not donated. "She will definitely lose the policy without AKF assistance, so I just wanted to see what we are able to do," the patient's social worker wrote in an email quoted in the suit.
Similarly, Mr. Gonzalez described the "rough treatment" given to Kaiser Permanente, the California group, which he says was blocked in 2015.
With revenues of $ 299 million in 2018, the American Kidney Fund is one of the country's largest charities and helped pay the insurance premiums of about 74,000 people in 2017, or about one in every five patients who underwent dialysis.
It continues to receive the vast majority of its support from DaVita and Fresenius. In 2018, the group's external auditors said it had received $ 247 million from two corporations, which represented 82 percent of its total revenues.
Though the two companies were not named, the whistle-blower complaint identified the group's primary contributors as DaVita and Fresenius, as have insurers and state regulators. The American Kidney Fund said it could not reveal the identities of the contributors.

GOP lawmaker victimized by scams takes aim at fake social media accounts

Texto completo: A Republican lawmaker is crafting legislation aiming at removing fake accounts from online social media platforms.
Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois is working with Facebook to craft regulations to cut down on the amount of fake accounts and scams that take place on its platforms, according to the New York Times. Kinzinger has been the victim of numerous scams for over a decade as people use his image and often his name to create fake accounts.
Kinzinger is a lieutenant colonel in the Air National Guard. The names and likenesses of U.S. service members are used to create thousands of fake social media accounts.
Dozens of victims of online hoaxes have contacted Kinzinger and his congressional staff claiming to have been in an online relationship with the congressman. In one case, a woman flew from India to Rockford, Illinois to meet Kinzinger, claiming she had been speaking with him online for months.
"She waited around in that bus station for two weeks for me to show up, and I didn't," Kinzinger said. "She's a poor lady, too. It took all her money to fly from India to me."
Kinzinger wrote Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerburg on Wednesday voicing concern about the number of fake accounts and hoaxes perpetrated on the tech executive’s platforms.
"Every day, there are countless by malicious actors to use your platform to scam others," Kinzinger said. The Illinois Republican requested information from Zuckerburg on Facebook's attempts to cut down fake accounts from its platforms.
"You have stated publicly that Facebook has a responsibility to protect your users and their data, and that 'the safety of people using Facebook needs to come before profit,'" Kinzinger wrote. "I fully agree, and while I understand that progress has been made, Facebook would not exist without its users. Thus, so much more must be done to protect them. I urge you to further expand your efforts on these fronts."
Facebook is still going over the letter to decide an appropriate response.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — President Trump was wrong to personally attack Rep. Elijah E. Cummings, D.-Md., a man widely respected by both Democrats and Republicans alike. But Trump was absolutely right when he called Baltimore “dangerous,” “filthy” and “rodent infested” — that is, if you can believe what you read in the “failing New York Times.”
<img class="size-medium wp-image-2657222" src="https://i0.wp.com/multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/Marc-Thiessen-color-2018.jpg?resize=300%2C235&ssl=1" alt="" width="300" height="235" data-recalc-dims="1" />
In March, the Times Sunday magazine published a heart-rending story entitled “The Tragedy of Baltimore,” which chronicled the precipitous decline of the city. It described how then-Mayor Catherine Pugh (D) toured the Highlandtown section of southeast Baltimore, as community leaders showed her a block where prostitutes gathered and there were piles of uncollected garbage and a liquor store that allowed drunks to congregate while pretending to wait for the bus. “‘Watch your step,’ someone called out as the group neared a dead rat,” the Times reported.
The city’s “regression has been swift and demoralizing,” the Times wrote, adding that officials have “struggled to respond to the rise in disorder, leaving residents with the unsettling feeling that there was no one in charge.” One resident contrasted the tourist-friendly Inner Harbor with her West Baltimore neighborhood, where, she said, “we’re all bolted in our homes, we’re locked down.”
Residents are locked down with good reason. In 2017, Baltimore had 343 homicides, a new record for killings per capita — more than New York City, which has 14 times Baltimore’s population. In 2018, there were 309 homicides, and so far in 2019, there were 171 homicides as of July 11 — up from 147 homicides at the same time last year. Baltimore is quite literally experiencing “American carnage.”
While the national poverty rate has dropped from 14.8% to 12.3% since 2014, Baltimore’s remains virtually unchanged at 22.4%. Children are trapped in failing schools that can’t teach them to read or do math at grade level. No wonder Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., once compared Baltimore to “a Third World country” and said it is “a community in which half of the people don’t have jobs [and] in which there are hundreds of buildings that are uninhabitable.” This is happening in Maryland, the richest state in the country. Talk about income inequality!
Pointing out these facts is not racist. It is also not racist to say that no one would want to live in these conditions — we should all agree that no one should have to. Nor is it racist to point out that this human tragedy is the responsibility of Baltimore’s leaders, and the direct result of five decades of Democratic rule. Democrats have held a lock on the Baltimore mayor’s office since 1967. They run the city council, the school system, the sanitation system, the housing authority and police department, and they represent the city in Washington. Gov. Larry Hogan (R), only the second Republican governor of Maryland since 1969, does bear some responsibility. But Baltimore is a deep-blue city in a deep-blue state; its plight is almost entirely a Democrat-created disaster.
Trump is wrong to attack Cummings for conducting vigorous oversight of conditions on the southern border; as chairman of the House oversight committee, that is his job. But Democrats want to have it both ways. They want to criticize what they see as inhumane conditions in U.S. detention facilities (and give a pass to those like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who outrageously compare those facilities to “concentration camps”) but then call Trump a racist for criticizing inhumane conditions in Baltimore.
The irony is, Democrats are in large part responsible for both situations. For months they refused to provide the emergency funds Trump requested to address the surge in border crossings, which left U.S. facilities on the border under-resourced and overwhelmed. And for years they have ruled Baltimore as a one-party fiefdom as the city turned into an island of despair amid a sea of prosperity.
The tragedy of Trump’s presidency is that he should be championing the people of Baltimore rather than using their plight to attack one of his critics. In 2016, Trump visited a black church in Detroit and gave a major speech in Charlotte in which he promised black Americans, “Whether you vote for me or not, I will be your greatest champion.” Last year, he was supposed to visit Baltimore to deliver a similar message but canceled. That would have been a lot more effective than a tweetstorm that only prompts Baltimore’s beleaguered residents to rally around their incompetent Democratic leaders.

LIKE THE BLACK SOX IT SEEMS LIKE SOME OF THE DEMS WANT TO LOSE

Texto completo: Watching Democratic presidential aspirants must have been like watching, a century ago, the 1919 World Series, when discerning spectators thought: Some of the Chicago White Sox are trying to lose. Michael Boskin, chairman of President George H.W. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers and currently at Stanford's Hoover Institution, pays the Democrats the injurious compliment of taking seriously their aspirations, which are characterized by a disqualifying flippancy. For example:
"Medicare for all" is popular (when depriving 217 million people of their private insurance goes unmentioned) because, Mr. Boskin notes, under Medicare today "most of its costs are paid by taxpayers, not the beneficiaries themselves. But if it covers everybody, there will be no one outside the system to subsidize the recipients." This will mean "much larger, politically determined taxes and cross-subsidies," and rationing of health care as in Canada and Europe "where long waits are the rule."
Sen. Bernie Sanders' plan promises no co-pays, no deductibles and no premiums, so pricing medical care at zero will produce a surge in demand for services from a Medicare system that already "faces unfunded liabilities more than twice the national debt" ($22 trillion). And the Part A Hospital Insurance Fund "won't be able to pay all its bills in a few years." And: "Current Medicare, with its low reimbursement rates, would be unsustainable without the large role played by the higher-paying private (primarily employer-based) plans in keeping doctors and hospitals in business."
Democratic promises include a $1,000-per-month universal basic income and $1,000 "baby bonds" for every newborn, plus up to $2,000 per year until non-wealthy babies are 18, free universal preschool and community college (perhaps four-year colleges, too), expanded child-care subsidies, rent subsidies (which will increase demand for, thereby increasing the cost of, rental units), complete forgiveness of $1.6 trillion of student debt, and on and on.
Mr. Boskin notes that the Social Security 2100 Act, which has 210 Democratic co-sponsors, would pay for the largest benefits expansion since 1972 by raising the payroll tax almost 20% to 14.8%, and uncapping the maximum earnings subject to the tax. Then add the promised 70% top income tax rate, a 3% wealth tax, a financial transactions tax, a one-third increase in the corporate rate and increased taxation of capital gains.
Mr. Boskin says the 70% rate, "an average 7% top state personal tax rate," and the 14.8% payroll tax by themselves would mean "a 91.8% marginal tax rate." And even this would not come close to paying for the Democrats' promised spending explosion.
Being scientifically as well as numerically illiterate, some Democratic candidates have embraced the Green New Deal's promise to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions from American agriculture, which is essential to feeding the world's 7.5 billion people.
Various candidates have also embraced the Green New Deal's "aspirational" objective of making America's approximately 100 million buildings fully energy efficient in 10 years. Mr. Boskin: "That would require retrofitting well over 4,000 buildings an hour for 12 years (almost 2,000 per hour for 15 years for Joe Biden's 'retrofit 50%' plan)." However, "just installing solar in a typical home takes two to three months on average."
The "party of science," as Democrats advertise themselves, is not the party of arithmetic. Many Democrats, however, think budgetary arithmetic has been rendered irrelevant by "modern monetary theory," which says:
A government that controls its money supply need never run short of it, and spending can substantially surpass government revenues as long as interest rates remain low. So, government, especially if it can strongly influence interest rates, is largely liberated from the essence of the human condition: scarcity. Hence everything is affordable. Republicans ridicule this while practicing it. The recent bipartisan budget deal increases spending $320 billion over two years, which USA Today notes is, on an annualized basis, much bigger than Barack Obama's 10-year stimulus package of about $800 billion.
Perhaps 2019 is 1919 with both parties being the White Sox, some of whom tried to lose that year's World Series and did. Unfortunately, in 2020 both parties cannot succeed at failing.

Gullible 'journalists' circulate a debunked conspiracy theory about Mitch McConnell’s wealth

Texto completo: Members of the news media are all-too-eager this week to share a viral tweet insinuating Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell enriched himself by abusing his position in Congress.
It is an easily debunked conspiracy theory — and it has been debunked, as even the most basic Google search reveals. But leave it to members of the press to amplify a thinly sourced, already addressed smear against a Republican.
This particularly stupid episode starts with an obscure Twitter user, “Akki,” whose bio reads: “21 // Animal Lover // Enjoys Politics // Follow me for quality tweets❤️ // #resist.” This person tweeted on July 31:
Sen. Mitch McConnell's net worth: 2005: $2,962,015 2015: $26,927,535 Increase: $23,965,520 (+809.1%) How does a senator earning $193,400 a year increase their net worth by nearly $2.4 million a year, every year for a decade?TweetThere is a simple, nonconspiratorial answer to the tweet’s obvious insinuation: The senator’s mother-in-law died in 2007, leaving a considerable fortune to McConnell's wife, U.S. Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao. This is basic, public knowledge, and has been since the last time McConnell foes questioned where his family got its wealth.
As of this writing, “Akki’s” tweet, which is either enormously lazy or intentionally misleading, has been shared by more than 30,000 social media users. Sadly, the people sharing it include top-tier news media personalities, who absolutely should know better. After all, they are up to their necks every day in cautionary news reports warning of the spread of misinformation on social media.
“Excellent question, [Senate Majority Leader],” tweeted MSNBC host and conspiracy enthusiast Joy Reid.
The New York Times’ Nicholas Kristof took a break from spreading North Korean agitprop to spread anti-GOP agitprop, tweeting in response to “Akki’s” nonsense, “McConnell, your response or explanation?” Kristof at least deleted the tweet later.
"[T]his sounds like a job for” Washington Post investigative reporter Dave Fahrenthold, tweeted former Time magazine editor-in-chief John Huey. Really?
Atlantic contributor Marie Lee asked, “drug running as side hustle, Koch brothers, dark $ – who paid off [Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's] debt?”
NBC News analyst Howard Fineman, who is still sore that people made fun of Maureen Dowd’s cocktail party, not only shared “Akki’s” conspiracy theory, but also gave it his own unique twist.
“Actually, he gets his personal money not from #Putin cronies, but from his very #XiJinping-connected family. So he’s bipartisan,” he said.
This is actually worse than merely falling for the lie, which Fineman knows it is not true. Rather than correct the record, he amplified it with an additional layer of conspiracy.
Luckily, not everyone in the news media is so willing to throw themselves on idiot hand grenades for the sake of sticking it to the Republicans. Decent journalists, including Bloomberg News’ Sahil Kapur and Politico’s Jake Sherman, were quick to note that dupes like Reid and Kristof were sharing a conspiracy theory that had been debunked long ago.
But look — many supposedly intelligent, in-the-know, well-versed-in-online-hoaxes media personalities rushed immediately to amplify a fake claim from an obscure Twitter user without so much as Googling whether it was true. After all, if you cannot trust a random, 21-year-old, animal-loving Twitter "Resister," who can you trust?
It really tells you something about our media culture, does it not?

Texto completo: SALT LAKE CITY — The final 10 democratic presidential candidates debated last night over who would be the best president and challenger to Donald Trump. Here are some reactions to the debate.
Fox News host Tucker Carlson said that after last night's debate, he realized that not all of the candidates are crazy.

- "It turns out that not everyone in the field is a lunatic. We stand corrected on that. In fact, there are a couple of sane ones. Unfortunately, they're getting crushed."

Charles Blow , opinion columnist for The New York Times, said that Andrew Yang impressed him the most from last night's debate.

- "But, when I see (Andrew Yang) — honest and unassuming — surrounded on a debate stage by these tacticians and poll watchers, the ones who shade the truth and blow with the wind, the ones consumed by ambition who think too much of themselves, he just stands out."

The Atlantic writer Edward-Isaac Dovere wrote that not much has changed with the passing of these two debates.

- "There’s an elevated train here, in the city’s downtown, called the People Mover. It doesn’t cost much to ride. It goes in a loop every 15 minutes or so. It moves only in one direction, around and around. It’s a lot like the Democratic primary, after two rounds of formal debate and seven months of campaigning."

During the debate, President Barack Obama's leagacy came under fire. Fox News contributor and former economic adviser for the Obama administration Robert Wolf said the attacks were shameful.

- "I'm still shaking my head. I mean, it was a circular firing squad that President Obama warned us all about. Unfortunately, Joe Biden was in the middle of the firing squad."

Sydney Ember, Katie Glueck and Astead W. Herndon of The New York Times wrote that while we don't know who the Democratic presidential nominee is, two potential paths for the party are becoming clear.

- "Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren represent two drastically different paths forward for the Democratic Party in 2020. But so far, they are the only top-tier candidates who have yet to debate each other, and their eventual matchup could be one of the most illuminating to date about the future of the party."

MSNBC host Chris Hayes offered some advice to the candidates on what their message should be over Twitter.

With the next round of Democratic debates set for Sept. 12-13, Donald Trump Jr. had a suggestion of who should moderate the next debate.

Comedy Central responded to that idea in a very expected manner.

Texto completo: Our series “How I became a …” digs into the stories of accomplished and influential people, finding out how they got to where they are in their careers.
From her beginnings starting an eBay store called Nasty Gal Vintage that turned into the booming fashion retailer Nasty Gal to writing New York Times bestseller #GIRLBOSS and founding the digital media brand and community Girlboss, Sophia Amoruso has been at the forefront of brand-building in the digital age.
USA TODAY caught up with Amoruso to talk about everything from iced matcha and Cat Stevens to learning tough lessons the hard way and being thirsty for knowledge.
Question: How did you get your start in the business world?
Sophia Amoruso: At 22, I started an eBay store called Nasty Gal Vintage and it exploded. In a few years, we went from $250,000 to $1. 1 million to $6. 5 million to $30 million in revenue. I had never even worked in an office before, but I followed my nose and built a really big business. That brand spoke to women in a way beyond fashion – Nasty Gal was a community, and that’s the throughput with Girlboss. When a customer bought a motorcycle jacket, it was something that was a promise to herself to be just a little more bold in her life, and it was beyond a motorcycle jacket – it was something that made her feel more confident to go out into the world. That’s very much what Girlboss is – we’re doing that more directly with our professional network that we just launched – and her being able to see herself in a life that she wants and being able to take small steps forward to achieve that and see other people that are doing it is very much what I’ve done throughout my career.
In terms of Girlboss, it’s another thing that exploded. I wrote a book (“#GIRLBOSS) five years ago now, and the hashtag’s been used 17 million times on Instagram, the book’s sold half a million copies, Netflix put a show called “Girlboss” to 100 million homes, and it’s very much part of the zeitgeist. As a company, we’re two years in, and we have a podcast network, a yearly conference called Girlboss Rally, but what we’re really doing that that all ladders up to is building a digital professional network for ambitious women.
Q: What does a typical workday look like for you?
Amoruso: I usually take calls from home in the morning, and come in around 10. I have a lot of meetings, more than I would like, but there’s a lot to do. Those things can range from looking at creative to talking about our road map to having touch bases to recording a podcast. There’s a lot of shifting gears and a lot of variety in what I contribute to and spend time on (with) Girlboss. I have therapy twice a week, so part of that takes me across town, but I often work in that area after therapy and have meetings closer to West Hollywood. I go home at maybe 7, and for the most part I cook dinner for myself – I enjoy cooking – and I’ll often work from home for several hours after that, just catching up because there’s so little time to clean my inbox or do deeper thinking while I’m at the office.
Q: What’s your favorite thing about your job? Amoruso: Being able to learn. Our platform is in beta, but I’m beta, and I’ll always be beta. I get to learn things that I would never otherwise be able to and that I never even knew existed. Just learning, really every day – it’s such a privilege to be in a place where our business requires that.
Q: What do you credit your success to?
Amoruso: Resourcefulness, grit, and curiosity.
Q: How do you balance work, life, and such a busy schedule? Amoruso: Unless I’m traveling, I don’t work on weekends. I make sure that if I need to work from home, I do. The whole team works from home on Fridays, which is really nice, and we’re able to work from anywhere. I rarely do business dinners – I go home almost every day and spend time cooking for myself, taking care of myself, and having some time alone until my boyfriend gets home, which is usually a little later than I get home. I make sure to do small self-care things, whether it’s doing yoga or something like getting my nails done – just stopping, taking care of my body, and feeling like I’m investing in feeling good and my body and who I am going out into the world. I also eat really healthfully: I don’t eat sugar, I don’t eat gluten, and that’s been really great because that 3 p. m. slump I get, I no longer get, and it’s been really great eating more healthfully.
Q: What have been some of your career highlights?
Amoruso: The cover of Forbes was huge; publishing “#GIRLBOSS” was an unparalleled experience; opening our first store with Nasty Gal was so exciting, and founding Girlboss. Being able to focus on Girlboss full time three years after the book was published, knowing that there’s been a community waiting for us to build what we’re building today for girls that have read the book and have been inspired by the Girlboss ethos – that we have now built a place for her to go and connect with one another and advance her career professionally. That’s really, really, really rewarding.
Q: What has been one of the biggest tough lessons you’ve had to learn as an entrepreneur?
Amoruso: Holding executives accountable. That’s something I could have done a better job at at Nasty Gal. I hire people, and I trust them. The advice is to let smart people do their jobs, but at the same time, everybody needs that kind of guidance. I had hired executives who had careers longer than I had been alive when I was in my twenties, and I thought they’d show up and dive into business and just do what needed to be done, but I could’ve stayed closer to their work. That’s something I’ve learned the hard way.
Q: What advice would you give to someone who wants to follow in your footsteps? Amoruso: Try a lot of things and find what resonates and what you’re good at. Especially when you’re young, you cannot fail. You have all the permission to jump around and try different things. Find smart people around you who have been there and done it. Seek out great advice, and stay curious. Use all of the resources you have at your disposal: read books, Google things, watch YouTube videos – whatever you need to answer the questions that you have. Find where you can gain that information and knowledge. A lot of that is on Girlboss – what we’re building with this social network is what I wish I’d had. To be able to connect with tens of thousands of women who have been there and understand what you’re going through more so than a Google search would is so, so powerful. There’s ways that you can fast-forward without having to learn those lessons the hard way by connecting with people who have done it.
Quick hits
• What’s your coffee order? Iced almond matcha right now from Intelligentsia here in Silver Lake.
• What’s your favorite book? I learned so much from “Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products” by Nir Eyal, about building digital products that people love.
• What’s your favorite song of the moment? “Father and Son” by Cat Stevens
• Who has been one of your biggest mentors? My executive coach, who I’ve had for like seven years, Jeff Welch. He’s coached me through good times and bad times, and taught me a lot about leadership and has just been so committed and someone who’s always there. It’s rare that you have someone involved in your career trajectory for so long.
• What’s the coolest thing you’ve ever done? Hiked the Kalalau Trail in Kauai. I did 11 miles in a day, and it’s one of the most dangerous hikes in the world. There’s this area called Crawler’s Ledge, and you’re literally on all fours crawling across. I had 30 pounds on my back – we backpacked in and out – and it was terrifying. I cried.

Texto completo: Sanders, Warren will beat a path for a Trump cakewalk
Re “Democrats battle over party's direction" (Page A1, July 31): Should either the angry old senator from Vermont (“I wrote the damn bill") or the sharp-tongued senator for Massachusetts (“I have a plan for that") become the Democratic candidate for president, we are in for very dark days ahead, and almost assuredly another four years of Donald Trump in the Oval Office.
While I believe this country needs big, bold ideas, Medicare for All, the Green New Deal, and the forgiving of all student debt will brand the Democrats, in the words of many Republicans, as “crazy socialists." There is only one issue to be resolved in the 2020 presidential election, and that is removing the metastasizing cancer in the White House. Unless and until that happens, there is no saving the Affordable Care Act, or making significant strides to combat climate change, or having a sane and sound immigration policy.
Democrats are polarizing themselves in an effort to stand out and score political points, while the juggernaut of Trump supporters and dark money is rushing to get this faux president reelected. As Thomas Friedman said in a recent New York Times column, we can have a revolution, or we can elect a sane and decent president, but we cannot accomplish both at the same time.

Democrats need to steer to middle to attract independents
As a lifelong independent voter, I'm pleading with the Democratic Party to nominate a presidential candidate who will attract independent voters in 2020. In 2016 my vote was to write in Evan McMullin. The Democratic candidate for 2020 should be able to beat Donald Trump. Beating Trump needs to be the Democratic Party's top priority.
That will happen if moderates are on the Democratic ticket. Extremes in politics are harmful to getting things done. Pushing an agenda that alienates middle-thinking voters is no way to take back normalcy.
Further, impeaching Trump is a bad idea. He will become the victim. With a Mitch McConnell-controlled Senate, Trump would never be voted out of office. Impeaching him would serve no purpose but to invigorate his base.
Please focus on voting Trump out of office in 2020.

Cisco Paying Millions In Flawed-Tech Case

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Cisco Systems agreed on Wednesday to pay $ 8.6 million to settle claims that it sold video surveillance technology that it knew had a significant security flaw to federal, state and local government agencies.
Cisco will pay civil damages in connection with software that it sold to various government agencies, including Homeland Security, the Secret Service, the Army, the Navy, the Marines, the Air Force and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, according to a government complaint unsealed on Wednesday.
Fifteen states, including New York and California, and the District of Columbia joined the Justice Department in the claim against Cisco, one of the world's largest sellers of software and equipment to businesses and governments. The case was filed in the Federal District Court for the Western District of New York under the False Claims Act, which addresses fraud and misconduct in federal government contracts.
The government said the video surveillance software it bought from Cisco was "of no value" because it did not "meet its primary purpose: enhancing the security of the agencies that purchase it." In many cases, the Cisco software actually reduced the protection provided by other security systems, the complaint said.
Cisco said in a statement that it was pleased to resolve the dispute. "There was no allegation or evidence that any unauthorized access to customers' video occurred as a result of the architecture," Robyn Blum, a Cisco spokeswoman, said in a statement.
The software vulnerability was identified in 2008 by a whistle-blower, James Glenn, who was working as a Cisco subcontractor in Denmark when he discovered that he could hack into the video software and take over the surveillance system without being detected, according to his lawyers at Constantine Cannon.
That September, Mr. Glenn told Cisco that he had discovered a flaw that hackers could use to gain unauthorized access to the video surveillance system, manipulate information and bypass security measures, Mr. Glenn's lawyers told The New York Times.
Mr. Glenn was laid off as part of what the company said was a cost-cutting measure five months after he reported the vulnerability. A year later, in June 2010, he realized that Cisco had not fixed the flaw and he could still hack into the surveillance system. Soon after, he contacted the F.B.I. to discuss the issue.
Cisco continued to sell the software with the vulnerability until July 2013, when the company let customers know about the flaw and released a way to fix the problem.
In its July 2013 disclosure, Cisco said several vulnerabilities in its software could allow an attacker to gain "full administrative privileges" to a video surveillance system, allowing that person to alter or remove camera feeds and archives. Cisco released software updates to fix the problems.
Government entities, especially smaller agencies, that do not have the resources to stay on top of cybersecurity best practices "are dependent on the software manufacturer," said Michael Ronickher, a partner at Constantine Cannon.
When Mr. Glenn reported the problem to Cisco in 2008, he was following a vulnerability disclosure practice that was beginning to be established in the technology industry. Today, many major tech firms offer so-called bug bounties to people who discover security flaws in their systems. And they are expected to let customers know -- and provide a fix -- as quickly as possible.
"You have the obligation to let your users know as fast as possible," said Jobert Abma, a co-founder of the security research service HackerOne. "I think waiting five years is never the right thing."
Cisco and other surveillance camera manufacturers came under increasing scrutiny in 2013 for the security practices of technology linked through the internet.
During a presentation at the Black Hat security conference that year, Craig Heffner, a security researcher, demonstrated how to hack into surveillance cameras made by Cisco and others.
The Federal Trade Commission opened its first enforcement action against a so-called internet of things company in September 2013, pursuing a company called TRENDnet. Flawed security allowed a hacker to post live feeds from 700 of the company's surveillance cameras online.
"Companies that don't pay attention to their security practices may find that the F.T.C. will," Edith Ramirez, who was F.T.C. chairwoman at the time, said in a 2013 speech.
Some technology providers delay making repairs to security flaws because they believe the risk is low, the cost of repair would be excessive or the patch might set off other problems, said Katie Moussouris, the chief executive of Luta Security who has drafted vulnerability disclosure standards that are used throughout the industry.
Also, once you let people know about a security flaw, "you are alerting all the bad guys at the same time," she said.
As the world becomes more dependent on technological security, this whistle-blower case, believed to be the first focused on cybersecurity, "is a harbinger of things to come," Mary Inman, a lawyer at Constantine Cannon, said. "We need whistle-blower insiders to be our eyes and ears and hold tech firms accountable."
The government has not claimed that anyone exploited the vulnerability that Mr. Glenn found. Cisco sold some of its video assets to Technicolor in 2015.

DOJ declines to prosecute James Comey on inspector general referral for leaking classified info

Texto completo: The Justice Department declined to prosecute former FBI Director James Comey following a criminal referral from the agency's independent watchdog, which concluded that Comey had leaked classified information and showed a lack of candor with investigators.
Inspector General Michael Horowitz reached out to prosecutors about one of the memos Comey leaked to a friend, which detailed a conversation he had with President Trump, after he was fired by President Trump in May 2017.
Although prosecutors found the watchdog's findings compelling, they decided against prosecution under classified information protection laws because of there being too much uncertainty surrounding Comey's intent, according to the Hill. A month after he was fired, Comey testified to Congress he had leaked his notes to a friend to give to the media, hoping that it would spark a special counsel investigation.
Then-Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Robert Mueller as special counsel the day after the New York Times first reported on details from one of Comey's leaked memos, which claimed Trump pressed his FBI director to drop an investigation into his national security adviser Michael Flynn. That memo was classified as "confidential" — the lowest classification level — after Comey sent the information.
With other investigations focused on the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation underway, one source said the DOJ did not want to “make its first case against the Russia investigators with such thin margins and look petty and vindictive."
Comey's lawyers did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Spokespeople for the DOJ and its inspector general also did not immediately respond to the Washington Examiner's request for comment.
The news comes hours after conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch announced it had obtained an FBI log about special agents arriving at Comey's home in June 2017 to retrieve his memos. The notes show Comey handed over four of them to the FBI agents, and he said to the best of his recollection two might be missing.
Although the DOJ declined to prosecute in this case, Comey, who has become a vocal critic of the president since his ouster, is not yet in the clear.
Comey is also a possible target of Horowitz's separate investigation into alleged Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuse. He signed three of the four FISA applications targeting former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page before being fired by Trump. Horowitz's report is expected to be released after Labor Day.
It is also likely that Comey's actions as FBI director will be scrutinized during the "investigation of the investigators," a review of the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation, being led by Attorney General William Barr and the U.S. attorney in Connecticut, John Durham.

Texto completo: President Trump resurrected the phrase as he again publicly slammed four freshman congresswomen for their criticism of the United States and his policies. He suggested they "go back where you came from," though they are all American citizens.
Whatever one thinks of the president's remarks - the predictable "racist" charge was leveled at him because the four are women of color and two are Muslim - the president is setting Democrats up for what could be a major defeat in the 2020 election by forcing them to embrace (probably) these people and their statements, thus causing further fallout within the party, or denounce them (unlikely) and risk electoral harm. It's a lose-lose for Democrats.
AXIOS, a nonpartisan news and information company, shared the results of a small, exclusive poll taken in May of a "crucial group of swing voters." Respondents, "1,003 likely general-election voters who are white and have two years or less of college education" put their approval of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib and Ayanna Pressley in low double or single digits.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi, discussing the congresswomen's opposition to the emergency border aid bill - a bill the leadership supported - seemed to dismiss them in an interview with New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd, "They're four people and that's how many votes they got." After the president's comments, Pelosi felt obligated to defend the four congresswomen, but that may come at a cost.
Sen. Lindsey Graham took things a step too far when he called the four "anti-America" communists on "Fox and Friends," another throwback to the McCarthy era, which Graham has previously denounced.
Still, this is likely to play well with people who believe too many politicians spend most of their time criticizing America instead of defending it.
The left swims in a deep sea of hypocrisy when it uses buzzwords like "diversity" and "racism." The Washington Times reported that congressional Democrats are opposing four "people of color" nominated to federal courts by President Trump. If a Democratic president had nominated these people and Republicans opposed them, is there any doubt the "racist" slur would be hurled at them?
Still, Sen. Graham was right when he also said it would be helpful if the president would "aim higher" and speak of their policies, rather than engaging in personal attacks. But their hatred for Israel and anti-America statements are their policies. Graham is correct in this sense: President Trump has the issues on his side. He is winning on things most people care about, especially the economy. Yes, he frequently touts successes, but they are often overshadowed by his personal attacks.
Winning an argument is better than winning a fight. Winning the argument proves your policies are correct. Winning a fight proves nothing, except who is able to beat up another person. There is no excuse for calling detention centers "concentration camps" and likening the Border Patrol to Nazi prison guards, especially since the four freshmen and other Democrats have the power to fix the migrant crisis, but won't because it appears they prefer having the issue to batter Republicans.

Texto completo: Retirement savings reform isn't a hot topic for journalists, but it's one of the few areas where Democrats and Republicans in Congress and President Trump could pull off some bipartisan reform when lawmakers reassemble in September.
The list of necessary fixes to current law is long As people live longer, the rules regarding "required minimum distributions" from savings plans need to have their age triggers increased. Overall maximum contribution levels should rise. Defined-contribution plans ought to be available for groups of employers so the costs of establishing and maintaining the accounts are not so high.
The amount of assets that Americans have stashed away for retirement is significant. The Investment Company Institute reported that the total of such assets stood at $28 trillion at the end of the first quarter, with $7.7 trillion in defined-contribution plans and $9.2 trillion in individual retirement accounts. Many Americans have little or no retirement savings, but a lot of Americans are regular contributors to their long-term fiscal health.
Most attention gets paid, understandably, to those who will depend entirely or nearly entirely on Social Security, with much less focus on those with healthier balances in their retirement savings. When Congress gets to retirement reform in the fall - Senate Finance Committee Chairman Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, and ranking Democrat Ron Wyden of Oregon are leading the effort - lawmakers ought to consider how they can help seniors stay in their homes as incomes decline or stop but mortgage payments stretch out into the future.
The Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University found that nearly three-quarters of senior Americans want to live in their own homes as they age. But because "housing is the single biggest item in most household budgets," Aging Options reports in its summary of the Harvard study, "housing-related expenses disproportionately affect a senior's financial security and their ability to save for the future." The burden of housing costs got heavier when Congress severely limited the deductibility of home mortgage interest in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.
If retirement reform allows seniors to pay off all or part of their home mortgage debt with money saved in their own retirement accounts without triggering taxes on the money used, then Congress will have taken a big step toward solving one part of this problem. Seniors with mortgages would then have the option of offloading their mortgage debt using money saved for their retirement without first having to pay federal and state income taxes on the money used to pay off the home loan. Millions of seniors would find themselves without a mortgage bill to pay and not facing a staggering tax bill as a consequence.
The Urban Institute concluded that the most valuable nonfinancial asset in the U.S. is a home, and that 69 percent of all families own one. Housing is the key element of financial security in retirement. Allowing Americans to use the money they have saved to pay off the homes they have purchased is the most obvious "fix" in the world, but congressional staffers I have asked about this always reply that it increases the risk of seniors having lower incomes from savings while also reducing future tax receipts. The latter objection makes little sense, as the taxable event of a withdrawal to pay off mortgage debt can simply be postponed from the date of the withdrawal to the date of the sale of the home.
Retirement security begins with a place to live. A senior American doesn't need as much savings if his or her home loans are paid off. This should be a no-brainer for every lawmaker, but it's not part of the draft laws circulating though the House or Senate.
Current data are difficult to find, but The New York Times reported in 2012 that 1.5 million homeowners over 55 lost their homes between 2007 and 2011, with the largest group being over 75 years of age. Those years followed the panic, of course, but even if seniors are not losing their homes, they are enjoying life less if they are making a mortgage payment they could avoid if their own retirement assets were available to pay off the mortgage.
The biggest obstacle to this obvious reform is the same one to most reforms: Permanent D.C. didn't think it up and hasn't internalized its logic. Maybe Grassley can change that, and in so doing, improve the quality of retirement for millions of Americans.

Texto completo: What's on TV
SHERMAN'S SHOWCASE 10 p.m. on IFC. Bashir Salahuddin and Diallo Riddle, two former writers for "Late Night With Jimmy Fallon," have had a very busy month. Last week, the pair debuted "South Side," their new Comedy Central sitcom about two friends in the Englewood neighborhood of Chicago. And this week sees the beginning of "Sherman's Showcase," another show from Salahuddin and Riddle, which is built around a tribute to a fictional variety show. It plays off vintage series like "Soul Train" and "Laugh-In," and makes a nostalgic vessel for the pair's humor. In this case, those sensibilities even carry over into fake commercials for real products like VHS tapes -- "watch movies in your own house for just 200 dollars a tape!" -- and the dating website Black People Meet. In a recent interview with The New York Times, Salahuddin described the show as an "an absurd, heightened world where we can play." He added, "It allows us to tap into that other part of our brain that's silly and carefree." And in a review for The Times, Mike Hale called the show "a pure jolt of stylized nostalgia, from its affectionate sendups of soul, R&B and hip-hop to its candy-colored sets with their abstract cutouts, traversed by roller-skating dancers."
UNMASKING JIHADI JOHN: ANATOMY OF A TERRORIST (2019) 8 p.m. on HBO. The revelation in 2015 that the notorious Islamic State executioner known as Jihadi John was actually a London-raised man named Mohammed Emwazi sparked intense discussion about the causes of radicalization in Europe. This documentary, through interviews with intelligence operatives, Emwazi's former teachers and others, attempts to shed light on how a young London man with a degree in computer programming became, by the time of his death in late 2015, a notorious ISIS militant.
JANE THE VIRGIN 8 p.m. on the CW. This telenovela comes to a close on Wednesday night. After five seasons, fans will finally find out how things wrap up for Jane Gloriana Villanueva (Gina Rodriguez) and Rafael Solano (Justin Baldoni), and whether the end of the story is bitter or sweet. "I think that the writers did a really beautiful job of using telenovela tropes and twists and magical elements to create a dynamic season where all the characters got a moment to shine," Baldoni said in a recent interview with The Times. "At the end of the day it's a love story, and I believe it plays out nicely."
What's Streaming
THE RED SEA DIVING RESORT (2019) Stream on Netflix. "Let's be very clear," Ben Kingsley says in a trailer for this Netflix thriller. "If this goes wrong, you'll all be hanging from cranes." Set in the early 1980s and based on a real rescue mission, the film casts Kingsley as the supervisor of a team of Mossad agents who smuggle Jewish refugees out of Sudan. The team, whose leader is played by Chris Evans, does this by taking over a fake tourist resort and using it as a front -- hence the title. Michael K. Williams co-stars as a rebel leader.

China, Russia are finding common cause

Texto completo: One of the striking warnings in a recent Pentagon white paper on the growing strategic threat from Russia is that its president, Vladimir Putin, could pull a “reverse Nixon” and play his own version of the “China card” with the United States, a reference to the former president’s strategy of playing those two adversaries against each other.
Until recently, any relationship between Russia and China could largely be dismissed as a marriage of convenience with limited impact on American interests. But since Western nations imposed sanctions on Russia after it invaded Ukraine in 2014, Chinese and Russian authorities have increasingly found common cause, disparaging Western-style democracy and offering themselves as alternatives to America’s postwar leadership. Now China and Russia are growing even closer, suggesting a more permanent arrangement that could pose a complex challenge to the United States.
“The world system, and American influence in it, would be completely upended if Moscow and Beijing aligned more closely,” John Arquilla, a professor at the Naval Postgraduate School, wrote in the report, to which Defense Department officials and other analysts contributed.
The latest evidence of warming ties was a meeting last month in Moscow at which Putin thanked the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, for enabling the two countries to do more than $100 billion worth of trade in 2018, up 30 percent from the previous year, and an implicit rebuke to America’s trade standoff with China. The two countries also signed more than two dozen agreements. That meeting came shortly after Xi called Putin his “best and bosom friend.”
The leaders have met almost 30 times since 2013. Russia recently agreed to sell China its latest military technology, including S400 surface-to-air missiles and SU-35 fighter jets.
While China and Russia have conducted joint military exercises intermittently for more than a decade, they began naval maneuvers in the Mediterranean in 2012 and last fall, staged what Russia called their biggest war games in decades in eastern Siberia. They plan to hold joint exercises on a regular basis in the future.
With melting ice opening new opportunities for oil and gas exploration, researchers from the two nations recently agreed to open a joint Arctic research center. They often vote alike at the United Nations and have similar positions on Iran and North Korea. Both have become much more active in the Middle East, where Russia is trying to regain its standing as a major power and China is trying to cultivate relations with energy suppliers like Iran.
The Pentagon white paper, and a separate report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, warn that the United States and its allies are not moving fast enough to counter efforts by Russia and China to foment instability with “gray zone” tactics that fall short of military involvement — the use of proxy forces, political and economic coercion, disinformation, cyberoperations, and jamming technologies against American satellites.
In his State of the Nation address in February, Putin expressed confidence that ties with China would enhance Russian security and prosperity, especially as he aligns his Eurasian Economic Union plan with China’s ambitious Belt and Road Initiative, a colossal infrastructure program designed to link China with Asia, Africa and Europe.
Given its economic, military and technological trajectory, together with its authoritarian model, China, not Russia, represents by far the greater challenge to American objectives over the long term. That means President Donald Trump is correct to try to establish a sounder relationship with Russia and peel it away from China. But his approach has been ham-handed and at times even counter to American interests and values. America can’t seek warmer relations with a rival power at the price of ignoring its interference in American democracy.
Given their history, China and Russia may never reach a formal alliance. The two have been divided by war and ideological rivalries and even now compete for influence in East Asia, Central Asia and the Arctic. Their contrasting trajectories would also make an alliance difficult. China is a rising power and the dominant partner; Russia is declining. China has the world’s second largest economy; Russia’s is not even in the top 10.
Still, their shared objectives could increase, further threatening Western interests. America needs to rally its democratic allies, rather than berate them, and project a more confident vision of its own political and economic model.

Harlan Lane, 82; embraced deaf culture as rich ethnic community

Texto completo: As a psychologist, writer, and advocate for those who are unable to hear, Harlan Lane had a way of focusing quickly and concisely on what was at stake for the deaf community, which he championed as its own distinct ethnic group with a vibrant culture.
That discussion should begin, he said, by examining who gets to decide what constitutes a disability — a label he called “squishy."
“My students don't think needing eyeglasses is a disability but that needing a hearing aid is," he told the Globe in 2001.
Dr. Lane, who had been the Matthews distinguished professor of psychology at Northeastern University, where he helped establish the college's American Sign Language Program, died July 13 in his home in Roquefort-les-Pins, France, near Nice, according to The New York Times. He was 82.
His friend and collaborator Dr. Richard Pillard told the Times the cause was Parkinson's disease.
“We remember his creativity, his impact, and his passion for his work, especially his dedication to the deaf community," Joanne Miller, who chairs Northeastern's psychology department, told the News@ Northeastern website. “Harlan had a truly remarkable career, and we were very fortunate to have him as a colleague for nearly 40 years, until his retirement in 2012."
Dr. Lane, who also had a home in Boston, had studied deaf culture since the early 1970s, when he happened to watch two deaf people converse. Impressed by American Sign Language's complexity, and its emotional breadth and depth, he conducted research that illuminated the richness in how those who are deaf communicate.
He also became a prominent critic of how a mainstream culture dominated by those who can hear treats those who can't — including the insistence by many medical professionals that the top goals should always be teaching the deaf to speak and surgically giving them the ability to hear.
“If you're talking about the deaf as an ethnic group, and what you're offering them is to try to change them to make them more like the majority, because life is easier for the majority, that's unethical," he told the Globe in 2011.
Dr. Lane also challenged the notion that it should be automatically considered beneficial for someone who has been deaf since early childhood to regain hearing through surgical means, and to then leave deaf culture behind.
Deaf people marry other people who are deaf “more than any other minority. I think that's very significant," he said in 2011, adding that “what's up is the value placed on being deaf."
He particularly opposed medical intervention — such as cochlear implants — for young deaf children, and he drew an analogy to others who aren't born into a majority group.
“With black Americans, if we told them we can make life a little easier for your kid because with a little plastic surgery and some skin lightening, which we can do nowadays, they're going to 'pass' more easily . . . I would step out of the way, because I might get punched, and justifiably so," he said.
Dr. Lane said that he “and deaf people, and others who know the deaf well see that there's no disability here. There's a physical difference, which many minorities have."
In an interview with The Washington Post, he once said that “cochlear implants are bad medicine. Pure and simple."
Harlan Lawson Lane was born on Aug. 19, 1936, in Brooklyn, N.Y. His parents divorced when he was young, and he was raised by a grandmother.
After graduating from Columbia University in New York with bachelor's and master's degrees in psychology, he studied under the behavioral psychologist B.F. Skinner at Harvard University, from which he received a doctorate in psychology. He taught at the University of Michigan and also earned a degree in linguistics at what is now called Sorbonne University in Paris.
In the mid-1970s, he was hired by Northeastern's psychology department and had served as its chairman.
While Dr. Lane was in California in the early 1970s, he was introduced to deaf students communicating in American Sign Language.
“I became quite excited because I realized there was a whole new way to look at the psychology of language," he said in an interview posted on a Northeastern website in 2011, the publication year of “The People of the Eye: Deaf Ethnicity and Ancestry," a book he cowrote. “I felt like Balboa discovering the Pacific."
Watching the students communicate led him to explore what he called “Deaf World" in books, journal articles, and research.
He would, in time, help start Northeastern's ASL program and establish a research laboratory that studied speech and language.
Cathy Cogen, the first director of Northeastern's ASL program, told the Times how determined Dr. Lane had been to start holding classes in which hearing students could learn sign language.
“But the college said 'no,' " she recalled. “Harlan didn't take no for an answer, and in his gentle and poised way, he started offering the classes. When students started streaming in, the dean's office said 'OK' and accredited them."
Dr. Lane wrote or cowrote several other books, including “When the Mind Hears: A History of the Deaf" (1984), “The Mask of Benevolence: Disabling the Deaf Community" (1992), and “A Journey into the Deaf-World" (1996).
In 1988, while teaching as a visiting professor at Gallaudet University in Washington, D.C., where the students are deaf and hearing-impaired, he watched proudly as students protested the school's selection of a hearing educator as its new president over qualified deaf candidates.
When the students commandeered the school's gym, Dr. Lane watched as their “flying fingers" conveyed an awakening of their cultural pride.
“In that silence you could feel the kids' excitement at being on their own and coming together with their own kind," Dr. Lane told The Chicago Tribune. “It's a feeling of solidarity that, once a minority experiences it, there's no turning them back."
The school subsequently reversed its decision and hired its first deaf president, I. King Jordan.
After Dr. Lane's death, Roberta J. Cordano, Gallaudet's current president, who is deaf, said in a statement: “As a hearing person who advocated for the rights of deaf people, Harlan Lane had few peers."
Information about Dr. Lane's survivors and a memorial service were not immediately available.
In 1991, he received a MacArthur fellowship — the so-called “genius" grants — for his work with the deaf. Speaking with the Globe then, Dr. Lane recalled that parents who learned their children are deaf sometimes sought his advice.
The parents often were anguished by the prospect of their children becoming part of a different culture with its own language.
He said he would tell the parents that “as difficult as it is to believe right now, something wonderful has happened, and if you embrace this miracle, you and your child can have a much richer life. If on the other hand you try to deny it, to bury it, you are condemning yourself and your child to a great deal of suffering."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump announced Sunday that he has selected Rep. John Ratcliffe to replace Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats when Coats leaves his post next month.
"I am pleased to announce that highly respected Congressman John Ratcliffe of Texas will be nominated by me to be the Director of National Intelligence. A former U. S. Attorney, John will lead and inspire greatness for the Country he loves," Trump said in a tweet.
"I am deeply grateful to President Trump for the opportunity to lead our Nation’s intelligence community and work on behalf of all the public servants who are tirelessly devoted to defending the security and safety of the United States," Ratcliffe said.
Here is what you need to know about the man Trump has tapped to be the next director of national intelligence:
He is more ideologically aligned with Trump
Coats' tenure as Trump's intelligence community czar was at times rocky, as the DNI director's assessments did not always conform to the president's political priorities.
Ratcliffe, 53, appears to be someone who will share more of Trump's perspectives.
For example, Coats declined to include immigration among the top threats facing the United States during his annual threat assessment before Congress in January, when Trump was calling it a national security threat. That same month, Ratcliffe voted against the appropriations bill to end a government shutdown because it did not include all the funds Trump had requested for a border wall and "ensure our national security needs are met. "
"When the safety of American citizens is on the line, we just can’t afford to miss the mark," Ratcliffe said in a tweet explaining his decision to vote against the bill.
What the director of national intelligence does
The director of intelligence is the head of the U. S. intelligence community. After the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, the 9/11 Commission cited a lack of communication and cooperation between various law enforcement and intelligence agencies as being partly to blame for a failure to identify warning signs that might have prevented the attack.
The DNI was established to better coordinate those agencies to prevent future domestic attacks. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence prepares the president's daily intelligence briefing and advises senior military commanders, as well as Congress, on national intelligence.
As a Cabinet-level position, the director of national intelligence requires Senate confirmation.
He made an impression during Mueller's testimony
Ratcliffe gained national attention last week when he aggressively questioned former special counsel Robert Mueller. He argued that the entire second volume of Mueller's report on potential acts of obstruction of justice should never have been written.
"You wrote 180 pages about decisions that weren’t reached, about potential crimes that weren’t charged or decided," Ratcliffe said. "Respectfully, by doing that, you managed to violate every principle and the most sacred of traditions about prosecutors. "
He also made an argument – which has since been repeated by Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney – that criticized Mueller's statement that while his "report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him. "
"It was not the special counsel’s job to conclusively determine Donald Trump’s innocence or to exonerate him because the bedrock principle of our justice system is a presumption of innocence," Ratcliffe said.
"Donald Trump is not above the law. He's not. But he damn sure shouldn't be below the law," he told Mueller.
The next day, during an interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity, Trump named Ratcliffe as one of the congressional Republicans he thought "represented themselves brilliantly" during Mueller's testimony.
Critics say he is too 'partisan'
While Coats has been praised for his independence from Trump, critics are already skeptical that Ratcliffe will be too eager to please the president.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N. Y. , said it would be a "big mistake" to "elevate such a partisan player to a position that requires intelligence expertise and non-partisanship. "
"It’s clear that Rep. Ratcliffe was selected because he exhibited blind loyalty to President Trump with his demagogic questioning of former Special Counsel Robert Mueller," Schumer said in a tweet on Sunday.
Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn. , on Monday said Ratcliffe was "an inapproriate choice" for the historically nonpartisan post.
"I think he's a television character that the president has watched on TV, and he wants to put somebody in this position who's going to agree with his political take on intelligence," Murphy said on MSNBC.
The New York Times reported Sunday that some Senate Republicans have similar reservations. Citing unnamed sources, the Times said Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr, R-N. C. , told the White House that Ratcliffe was "too political" for the job.
Ratcliffe defeated a 34-year incumbent in 2014
Ratcliffe unseated 17-term Rep. Ralph Hall in a 2014 primary election. Hall, first elected to Congress in 1980, was a Democrat who changed parties in 2004.
With tea-party support, Ratcliffe campaigned against Hall as a Washington insider who had been on Capitol Hill for too long. Hall, the oldest serving member of Congress when he left office at 91, claimed he once sold cigarettes to the notorious outlaws Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow.
He is a former U. S. attorney and small-town mayor
Ratcliffe served as a U. S. attorney for the Eastern District of Texas from 2007-2008.
On his congressional biography, he boasts that in his stint as a federal prosecutor, he "put terrorists in prison, arrested 300 illegal aliens in a single day, and cracked down on drug trafficking and public corruption. "
From 2004 to 2012. he served as mayor of Heath, Texas, an affluent suburb on the shores of Lake Ray Hubbard, about 25 miles from downtown Dallas. According to the U. S. Census, the town currently has a population of 8,953, up from 6,921 in 2010.
Racliffe's biographby says that as Heath's mayor, he "balanced the budget for eight consecutive years without ever raising taxes. "

Is a billionaire populist the right choice for Democrats?

Texto completo: These are strange times, as Democratic voters consider whether the best way to take on a billionaire populist is to nominate their own inexperienced billionaire populist.
The Democratic presidential primary now has its 25th candidate, with the late entry of Bay Area billionaire Tom Steyer, a climate-change and impeachment activist.
Steyer hasn’t made a dent in the polls, but his money could shake up the race given his intent to spend $100 million.
So far, Steyer’s entry has gone over like a lead balloon. “Interviews with Democratic senators and representatives revealed significant resentment toward Steyer for his practice of using his wealth to pressure lawmakers that have not advocated for impeaching President Trump,” reported the Free Beacon.
His ads targeting anti-impeachment Democrats, and slams against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, haven’t made him many friends on the Left.
His personal wealth is an obstacle in a party that views billionaire financiers as a scourge. And his big-spending plans would find resistance with the broader electorate.
Steyer’s “Justice-Centered Climate Plan” might not go as far as the “Green New Deal,” but it’s estimated to boost government spending by $2.3 trillion — at a time when federal debt has soared to $22 trillion and both parties have agreed to obliterate spending caps.
Most observers view Steyer’s long-time environmental advocacy as sincere, but he has to deal with allegations of hypocrisy. The New York Times reported in 2014 that Steyer’s fund had “pumped hundreds of millions of dollars into companies that operate coal mines and coal-fired power plants from Indonesia to China, records and interviews show.” He has expressed regret for fossil-fuel investments, but it makes for bad optics among Democrats.
Other Democratic candidates are peeved at a billionaire buying his way into the presidential fray. “All campaigns should be grassroots funded in a primary,” said U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, who is polling in the top tier.
U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, has likewise criticized the role of billionaires in the election process. Several left-leaning commentators have rolled their eyes at Steyer’s entry and have asked him to just go away.
On the good side, Steyer has taken shots at the socialistic ethic that is emerging on the Democratic left.
“Should we put a limit on what Beyoncé makes?” he asked the Guardian. “I don’t see why. I don’t think in the United States of America we should put a ceiling on how far people can go.”
He even took aim at Karl Marx. We’re dismayed that it’s even necessary to point out the flaws of Marxism in 2019, but we’ll take small victories when we get them.
In our view, the Democrats have their best chance of unseating Donald Trump by running mainstream moderate-to-liberal candidates who campaign on national unity rather than progressives who are intent on remaking the economy and ratcheting up federal spending. But that’s ultimately for their voters to decide.
Based on Democratic Party rules, however, Steyer needs a large base of small donors or decent poll numbers to make it onto the stage.
Despite our misgivings about Steyer’s candidacy, there’s nothing wrong with having a freewheeling election where the largest number of candidates pitch their ideas.
We wish Steyer and the other candidates were discussing better ideas, but that’s a discussion for another day.

Air hockey wiz aims for a top ranking

Texto completo: It isn't impossible, but it's tough to get better at air hockey without a table. Just ask Louisville native Liz Cash, who is probably one of the best players in the world.
Before her breakthrough, and before she was set to attend this weekend's Air Hockey World Championships, she and her training partner had one goal – win the 2017 amateur tournament, and take home the grand prize.
"The winner of the amateur bracket won an air hockey table, which, for me and my teammate, was a really good opportunity," Cash said Monday in a phone interview from New York City. A new regulation-size air hockey table can cost upward of $2,000.
They came up short that time, but Cash has been busy in the two years since, training at the same Brooklyn pool hall on the same creaky old table. The goal this year, it's safe to say, is a little different.
"I don't want to be cocky," she said. "My teammate definitely thinks that I have what it takes right now to be the top-ranked woman."
Cash, 36, had just wrapped up a four-hour practice Monday when contacted by the Courier Journal. She'd spent a little more time that afternoon at Brownstone Billiards because longtime air hockey pro Michael Rosen had come by to hit the table with her and Justin Flores, her training partner and another one of the top players in the country.
It was an exhausting session, but with the Air Hockey Players Association's world championship just days away, she didn't have time to take a break. Cash will fly to Colorado for the tournament Thursday, with the competition beginning the next day. And while getting ready to face the best air hockey players in the world obviously requires a lot of time on the table, that's not all it takes.
'High-speed chess' Cash knows you might not take air hockey too seriously, and she didn't either when she got into the sport a few years ago. The way she prepares, though, is no joke.
There are the marathon sessions at Brownstone Billiards, her normal training spot and one of the few places in New York with a regulation-size 8-foot table. And there are the gymnastics exercises at Crossfit Kingsboro, where she works with clients as a personal trainer.
But there's also juggling, she said, as a way to exercise her cerebellum, and other vision drills she uses when she isn't able to practice on an actual air hockey table.
"The function of the cerebellum is precision of movement, accuracy with targets, anything that has to do with rapid movement," Cash said about her training. "So with air hockey, I thought 'OK, let me do what I can when I don't have a table' because we have very limited access."
Mental focus is important, but staying loose physically is as well. Cash said the key is being able to move quickly – your game has to be "fast and furious," with quick reaction times. That all goes back to your shoulders and other joints.
"In air hockey, there's a number of shots that can be executed from more points off the table if you have as much mobility at the wrist, elbow and shoulder. That way you can quickly pop into whatever position you need to end up in to hit the shot at just the right angle," she said. "That's the name of the game – how many shots can you hit from as many places on the table as possible?"
It's a lot of work, with or without an air hockey table, but that's what it takes against the toughest competition.
"At this level of air hockey, it's really high-speed chess," she said. "You have to be able to pretty quickly identify what your opponent's weak points are, and what are their strong points against you, and how can you flip the script from that to exploit whatever they're not good at and capitalize on your strengths."
Taking air hockey seriously Versatility is one of Cash's specialties. She was a member of the soccer, rowing and rock climbing teams at St. Francis School in Louisville and took up boxing and competitive cycling during her time at the College of Santa Fe. In her spare time growing up, she played the drums and practiced martial arts, which she took up when she was 5 years old. She practiced kung fu in high school.
Those sports and activities, which ignited her competitive drive, gave her a base when she started to take air hockey seriously. But it was a learning process.
Cash met Flores in 2015 when a friend whom she had casually played with invited her to an air hockey event at a New York bar. She didn't hear from Flores again, she said, until 2017, when she published a social media post about air hockey.
"He happened to see it and was like, 'oh, hey, I see you're still playing – do you want to come to Air Hockey World Championships?" she said. "And so, with like eight weeks to go, I was like 'sure, that sounds like fun!'"
They didn't win, although they gave it their best as teammates in the doubles rounds and in the amateur tournament. But she's honed her skills in the two years since, practicing two or three times a week for hours at a time leading up to tournaments, and others have taken note. Cash and Flores were the subjects of a recent New York Times article detailing their training and strategy.
You better believe the competition has read that story by now – and studied Cash's stance, where she whips her leg up to get as much force behind the puck as possible.
They're not the only ones paying attention, though. Cash can name-drop other contenders who will be in Colorado this weekend and is familiar with strengths and weaknesses of her competition. It's a one-bracket tournament that isn't split up between genders, and Cash said her goal is to have the best finish among all the women.
"I've watched some footage on some of the other female competitors," said Cash, who graduated from St. Francis in 2001. "... The only real wild card for me is how they seed the tournament. I could go up against the current world champion – like, the overall world champion – and that could be a very different outcome early in the tournament."
Cash and Flores will each compete in both the singles and doubles competitions. They'll take the table as teammates in Friday's doubles tournament, and then will go it alone in the singles bracket a day later.
Winning will be a marathon, not a sprint. The first person to score seven points wins the game, and you have to win a best-of-seven series of games to win a set and advance. That can take some time, especially against high-level competition.
It may look easy when you watch a couple take a table at the bar. But when a contender like Cash is on the table, it's a different game entirely.
"Air hockey is a little unique because it requires the kind of fast-twitch muscles that create quick reactions and explosiveness, but you also have to have endurance," she said. "It's more of a sport than people realize, because you really have to have your nutrition, and your hydration. Your muscles have to be able to go the distance to play for hours."

Chef's tastes: Simple, fine dining

Texto completo: Chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten is one of the most revered chefs in the world.
The Michelin-starred chef has fed Oprah, George Clooney and the Dalai Lama. His eponymous fine-dining restaurant in New York received four stars from The New York Times.
Born and trained in France, Vongerichten owns and operates 39 restaurants worldwide and has shared his work on programs like the "Today Show," "Good Morning America" and "Top Chef."
We caught up with the acclaimed chef as he prepped his latest restaurant Jean-Georges Philadelphia, which opens at Four Seasons Hotel Philadelphia in August. Vongerichten dished on food trends and let us know what's fresh and what's past their expiration date.
Questions and answers have been edited for length and clarity.
Question: What's your favorite trend happening in food today?
Jean-Georges Vongerichten: When I came to New York in 1986, people were eating Chinese food on Sunday nights. I feel today, people eat Asian food two or three times a week because they're looking for new sensation, new flavors. ... palates have changed nowadays. They have more tolerance for spice, for acidity, for more flavor on the food.
Q: Are there any food trends you don't like?
Vongerichten: Molecular gastronomy. What I love is the last couple years, we went back to more basics, like simple food. I'm not too crazy about sous vide as well, because I feel like, if you live in a city like Philadelphia or New York, you don't need to put things in a bag or cook it in a bag. I like fire. I like live cooking. I think we're going back to that, to a more simple, more direct way of cooking. I feel we are going back in touch to more simple life and more simple things. Nobody needs chemicals in their food. I feel the molecular gastronomy was a little out of whack.
Q: What food will never go out of style?
Vongerichten: People are always going to eat Italian food. They're always going to have sushi. Is it creative sushi? Is it traditional sushi? I mean, it's still sushi. Same thing with Italian. But you know what's never going to go out of style? Good food. Delicious food. Some type of people are looking for weird combination, but, in the end, we're all going back to delicious.
Q: Your career in food and dining has taken you all over the world. Are there any food trends from other countries you wish were more popular in America?
Vongerichten: When I go to a new city I've never been to ... I drop my luggage in the hotel. I go straight to the market, and I see how people eat. I feel like all the markets in Asia are run by people cooking at the market. If you look at the food trucks and everything else, the only street food we had in New York for many years was hot dogs. Now we have all kinds ... I'm a big fan of street food.
Q: What's an older trend that isn't in style anymore but you think should be brought back?
Vongerichten: I feel like in the old days, everything was on a platter. Everything was cooked in a pot, and put the pot in the middle of a table, and people served themselves. I feel we're going back to that a little bit. I don't know if it's the "Game of Thrones" cooking, where you put the leg of lamb in the middle of the table and people slice their own. People want to see the real food. I feel like we're going back to bigger pieces, less plating, less touching the food.
Q: How important would you say presentation is to the overall dining experience?
Vongerichten: Oh, it's very important. I mean, everything has to be Instagramable. Is it a whole chicken on fire or is it something beautifully presented with edible flowers? I think today, visual is very important, as you know. Is it simple? Is it complicated? But the visual I think today where everyone is posting food, everybody is taking pictures of views of design, I think it's a way of communication today. Sometimes if I go to a restaurant, I go to Instagram to see what the food looks like before I actually make a reservation.
Q: How do you think people will be eating in the future?
Vongerichten:I believe that the future of food is really plant-based. I was saying that to all my chefs. We're still gonna eat steaks and fish and a lot of things, but I think, as a daily diet, we're probably gonna eat more plants and grains.
Q: Who are some celebrities or famous people you've served in your restaurants?
Vongerichten: Oh my God, I have a huge list, but I don't remember all the names. You know, George Clooney to Oprah. We cooked for the Dalai Lama once. Every day, we have people coming to our restaurants as well, but I feel like everybody is somebody. When you come to us, we treat you the same way.

Texto completo: Opera Maine is celebrating its 25th anniversary with an attractive, solidly sung production of Mozart's "The Magic Flute," its first presentation of the work.
That was refreshing in itself: Since 2012, the company has been revisiting works it had performed in its early years, offering new productions of eight of the 19 works on the company's mainstage repertoire list. (There are another 19, - plus a version of Rossini's "The Barber of Seville," which was also presented in a mainstage production - among the works performed by singers in Opera Maine's Studio Artist Program.) Next summer, the company will add another new title, Wagner's "The Flying Dutchman," in a production that sets the work on the Maine coast.
It almost goes without saying that, on purely musical grounds, "The Magic Flute" is a spectacular work. Technically a Singspiel, it has stretches of spoken monologues and dialogues, which Opera Maine presented in English, amid arias, duets and choruses, which are sung in German here. Because Mozart tailored these pieces to the skills of the singers in the work's first production, in 1791 (just over a month before his death, at 35), they range from relatively easygoing, even a bit folksy (for example, the music for Papageno, the comic birdcatcher) to stunningly virtuosic (the Queen of the Night's two high-flying showstoppers).
But the work's libretto, by Emmanuel Shikaneder, has elements that raise eyebrows in 2019. A fantasy in which Prince Tamino, with Papageno at his side, must find and win the love of Pamina, with whom he becomes an initiate into Sarastro's temple of wisdom, truth and love - a society that was, for Mozart and Shikaneder, a metaphor for Freemasonry - it is replete with turns that today would raise red flags over race and gender issues.
The Opera Maine production, directed by Dona D. Vaughn, the company's artistic director, worked hard to skirt those issues, partly by fielding a cast far more diverse than Mozart would have imagined, and in some cases, with deft editing.
One example: Monostatos, the overseer of the slaves, is a Moor, which the company acknowledges by decorating his headquarters with geometric designs in an Islamic style. Historically, the role was sung in blackface, but that notion is a non-starter today. Moreover, the cast's excellent Pamina, Brandie Sutton, is black. That made a bit of dialogue between her and Papageno awkward, as written: Referring to Monostatos, Papageno notes that he has seen black birds, so why shouldn't there be black people? That line is increasingly deleted these days, and Opera Maine sensibly deleted it here.
The production was an inventive demonstration of how technology can overcome budget constraints. Erhard Rohm's sets are deceptively simple - angled flats painted as light-colored stone walls, a couple of large pillars and a doorway, mainly. But Kate Ashton's lighting and Alex Basco Koch's projections (including film, which makes Tamino's and Pamina's trials by fire and water seem dynamic rather than static) create the illusion of frequent set changes.
Add to this Millie Hiibel's costumes, which range from traditional (Sarastro and his followers wear long robes; Papageno and Papagena, his mate, are heavily feathered, and Monostatos wears a turban) to amusingly odd (the Three Ladies, emissaries of the Queen, wear large crow heads that make them look like space aliens; the Three Spirits, in post-punk hairdos, wear shoes with rollers that allow them to glide across the stage).
The company's cast was generally strong. Tenor Geoffrey Agpalo, though not the most overtly heroic Tamino, sensibly brought out the prince's sensitivity and steadfastness. Sutton's Pamina was somewhat more refined, and projected the sense that being tugged in so many different directions by the Queen of the Night (her mother), Sarastro, Monostatos and Tamino has made her a more mature character than Tamino - which, in turn, clarified the degree to which Tamino's trials were (Masonic ritual notwithstanding) meant partly as a way to make him grow up, to be worthy of Pamina.
The Queen of the Night is often played with greater dramatic posturing than soprano Kathryn Bowden brought to the role, but her approach suited this production perfectly. A high-drama portrayal accepts Shikaneder's characterization of the queen as a villainess, but if you're reconsidering the libretto, you have to admit that she may have legitimate grievances.
In any case, Bowden's performances of the queen's arias were extraordinary; in her second act showpiece, "Der HÃ¶lle Rache" ("Hell's Vengeance"), she sang the stratospheric Ds and Fs as if hitting them was the easiest thing a soprano could be asked to do.
Baritone Robert Mellon played Papageno with a millennial touch and did a fine job vocally; soprano Yeonji Lee matched his comic pacing nicely as Papagena.
Hidenori Inoue, who did stellar work in the 2017 Studio Artist production of Jack Perla's "An American Dream," was less fully suited to Sarastro. He has the notes, and he captured much of the role's dignity and depth, but not quite the power and heft that Sarastro demands.
Roberto Kalb, who joined the production at the last minute, when conductor Stephen Lord bowed out after singers at other companies complained of sexual harassment, led a thoughtful, well-paced and often exciting performance.

Texto completo: Headnote SCLCS 61st Annual Convention Last Week Centered 'Unapologetically' on Ending American Poverty
The South Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), a national leader in civil and political rights, held a convention in Atlanta from July 18 to July 20 to scrutinize a topic many Americans are rather uncomfortable discussing - poverty.
Although the United States still boasts the largest economy in the world, and consistently ranks among the wealthiest countries in terms of GDI per capita, poverty and income inequality remain pressing issues. The Census Bureau's 2017 data puts the poverty rate at 12.3 percent, meaning about 40 million Americans were officially considered to be below the poverty line that year. That rate was down 0.4 percentage points from 2016; however, several academics say that number could be underestimating America's impoverished population by up to 16 million people because the official poverty rate does not consider unexpected job loss, ill health, or lack of health insurance.
Moreover, income and wealth inequality have been growing steadily for decades. According to a 2017 report published by the Institute for Policy Studies, a progressive think tank, the top three richest Americans - Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates and Warren Buffett - have collectively amassed more wealth than the bottom half of Americans, about 160 million people. Additionally, the IPS has claimed that if the Census Bureau redefined the official poverty measure to include those making less than twice the poverty line (who are classified as "low income"), and accounted for the Supplemental Poverty Measure, about 140 million people, almost 40 percent of Americans, would be classified as poor.
Dr. Charles Steele, Jr., the current president of the SCLC, recalls the iconic organization's founder, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., who in 1968 took a deliberate stance against poverty in the form of the Poor People's Campaign.
"Over fifty years ago, Dr. King was assassinated and gave his life, the supreme sacrifice, in regard to poor people in the Poor People's Campaign," says Dr. Steele. "He said America is too rich to allow poverty within this country. And fifty years later, this country's relationship to poor people is worse than it was [back then]."
Millions of Americans, he says, live paycheck to paycheck and are unable to withdraw $250 in the event of an emergency. The Mississippi Delta, whose extreme poverty first galvanized Dr. King to launch the campaign, is still the poorest area of the country today.
Dr. Steele has led the SCLC for over a decade and believes America's reckoning with poverty, and its intersection with racism, is long overdue. He says the unfortunate lack of progress the country has made on this issue is a result of our refusal to discuss it outright.
"Dr. King has always said, and it still remains today, [that] the three ills in society happen to be racism, poverty and militarism," Dr. Steele says. "And this is something that we as a people in America refuse to bring to the top of the agenda."
Rather than directly address poverty or poor people, he says, lawmakers and candidates use euphemisms like "income inequality," "Medicare for all," and "free college tuition." Likewise, the average American is either uninformed about the problems facing the nation's poorest or is willfully ignoring them.
The first step to solving the poverty crisis, according to Dr. Steele: Conduct thorough research on the issue and then disseminate those findings to the public. Achieving the latter was precisely the goal of the SCLC's 61st Annual Convention last week, which was aptly named, "Maintaining the Global Village: Housing, Health and Our Common Humanity."
As the title implies, the conference, while mainly focused on American issues, also acknowledged the impact we have on the rest of the world, and vice versa.
"We are in a global village," Dr. Steele says. "What affects one part of the world always effects the other."
In keeping with its roots in the civil rights movement, the SCLC made sure to stress the burden that African Americans and other racial minorities bear when it comes to impoverishment. The racial wealth gap is an especially dismal problem. According to the New York Times, the average Black family acquires $5.04 of wealth for every $100 of wealth a White family acquires.
"We lost 50 percent of the Black wealth in America," Dr. Steele says. "Black wealth was lost when we lost our homes during the housing crisis more than a decade ago."
Housing, he says, is the number one problem for African Americans. That's why part of the conference was also dedicated to announcing the SCLC's plans for a new program to provide affordable housing in some notably neglected areas of the U.S. Dr. Steele is particularly concerned with communities that have recently been afflicted by natural disaster.
"When Hurricane Michael came through, that was one of the worst storms that hit the North American soil," Dr. Steele recalls. "Nobody is talking about it now. Panama City Beach is almost rebuilt, but homes and properties in the Black community were heavily damaged and nobody is talking about it."
The SCLC has plans to partner with the American Red Cross and other humanitarian aid organizations to assist recovery efforts in Panama City, Florida. It will open community crisis centers to provide desperately needed services and to encourage more people to seek help.
"One thing we must never forget, there is always another storm coming, and we must prepare particularly for poor people, because every time a storm comes, it devastates poor more than any other segment in our society," Dr. Steele says.
While much of the convention focused on training and mobilizing the next generation of civil rights leaders, the SCLC also took a moment to honor legendary and remarkable individuals who dedicated their lives to fighting for those living in poverty.
In a press release published the week before the convention, the SCLC said: "Those being recognized include the family of the late Rev. Joseph Boone, an Atlanta civil rights leader who died in 2006; The Rev. Fred Taylor, who has been a significant 'Foot Soldier' in The Movement for more than 50 years; Rev. Dr. Joseph Lowery, former president of the SCLC; former Ambassador Andrew Young, who was a top aide to Dr. King, and Xernona Clayton, the founder and CEO of the Trumpet Awards, who also worked closely with Dr. King, and former award-winning Newsweek Magazine journalist and southeast bureau chief, Vernon Smith."
Hillary Clinton appeared at the conference to accept the SCLC's Realizing the Dream Award for her lifelong work as an activist and politician battling for civil and human rights.
"It is a time to reassert our commitment to the future that will realize the dream, but to recognize that the work is never over," Clinton said during her acceptance speech. "I think some of us, we're a little surprised that we have to be having the same conversations, arguing over the same points but that is the hand we have been dealt."
Under the leadership of Dr. Steele, the SCLC continues, despite the glacial pace of progress, to fight for the basic human rights to which all people, rich or poor, are entitled.

Texto completo: DoorDash Inc. plans to change how it pays food-delivery workers after facing criticism for applying customer tips to the minimum payments that workers receive for each drop-off.
The closely held delivery service will roll out a new compensation structure to ensure worker pay rises when customers tip on its app, Chief Executive Tony Xu said Tuesday on Twitter.
"The new model will ensure that Dashers' earnings will increase by the exact amount a customer tips on every order," Mr. Xu said.
The company, which in May was valued at $13 billion following a $600 million funding round, didn't respond to a request for comment.
DoorDash currently guarantees workers a minimum amount for each delivery based on the time and effort it expects is required to complete the task, it says on its website.
When customers electronically add a tip to their total bill, the company puts that payment toward the guaranteed minimum it pays the worker, rather than increasing the payment by the amount of the tip. Workers see how much the minimum is before they agree to handle the delivery, according to DoorDash.
"We did not launch our current model to pay Dashers less," Mr. Xu said on Twitter.
The New York Times published a story on Sunday that discussed the compensation model, sparking criticism of the how DoorDash handles tips.
DoorDash has been pushing to expand its footprint and sign deals with restaurants. The company recently agreed to start delivering food for McDonald's Corp. The hamburger chain also has tapped Uber Technologies Inc.'s Uber Eats business to provide delivery services.

Ruling by Federal Judge Temporarily Blocks New Abortion Laws in Arkansas

Texto completo: In an 11th-hour ruling, a federal judge temporarily blocked three new abortion restrictions from taking effect in Arkansas on Wednesday, including a law that bans the procedure after 18 weeks and another that could threaten to close the state's only surgical abortion clinic.
The decision, issued minutes before midnight on Tuesday by Judge Kristine G. Baker of the Eastern District of Arkansas, delays enforcement of the laws by up to two weeks. The delay was requested as part of a broader suit seeking to strike down the laws, brought by the clinic, Little Rock Family Planning Services; Planned Parenthood; the American Civil Liberties Union; and local doctors.
In Tuesday's ruling, Judge Baker concluded that all three restrictions -- the 18-week ban, a ban on abortions sought because of a diagnosis of Down syndrome, and stricter requirements on who may perform the procedure -- all seemed likely to be found unconstitutional based on the evidence provided so far.
"Since the record at this stage of the proceedings indicates that Arkansas women seeking abortions face an imminent threat to their constitutional rights, the court concludes that they will suffer irreparable harm without injunctive relief," she wrote.
In a statement on Wednesday, Attorney General Leslie Rutledge of Arkansas said the attempt to block the laws was "frustrating, but not unforeseen."
"The action was only the initial step and I anticipate further action in the near future in our defense of these laws that protect the life of mothers and their unborn children," Ms. Rutledge said.
Most states follow the precedent set by the 1973 Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision, which said abortion is legal until the fetus reaches viability, usually between 24 to 28 weeks. But conservatives across the country this year have pushed for stricter restrictions, aimed, in some cases, squarely at challenging that precedent.
Arkansas was among nine states that passed bills to restrict abortions in 2019, limiting the procedure to the middle of the second trimester at 18 weeks in what was one of the most restrictive such laws in the nation.
According to the Arkansas Department of Health, the majority of abortions at the state's three abortion clinics take place before the 16-to 18-week pregnancy period, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported. In 2017, the health department had a record of 3,249 abortions and of those, 173 were done at 16 weeks or beyond, and only 75 of those were done after 18 weeks.
Because the date of conception can be difficult to determine, doctors measure the start of pregnancy from the first day of a woman's last menstrual period, which is usually two weeks before a fetus is conceived.
Even if the law imposing new requirements on who can perform abortions does not force Little Rock Family Planning Services to close, it would likely drastically limit the ability of abortion providers to meet the needs of women in the state, Judge Baker wrote.
"The record evidence indicates that anywhere from 57-66 percent of Arkansas women who wish to have an abortion will be unable to obtain an abortion," she wrote.
In a statement, Holly Dickson, legal director and interim executive director of the A.C.L.U. of Arkansas, welcomed Judge Baker's ruling and vowed to continue fighting to have the laws struck down.
"Personal medical decisions are just that -- personal -- and politicians have no business barging into people's private decisions, shutting down clinics and blocking people from care that they need," she said.
The fight to overturn Roe v. Wade has intensified in recent years. Without it, a large amount of women in the South and Midwest would be living without an abortion clinic nearby. The country's abortion rate would be 13 percent lower without the landmark ruling, a new analysis found, and it would mostly affect low-income people who couldn't afford to travel to a legal clinic.
"Wide swaths of the country face potential dramatic increases in travel distances to states where abortion would likely remain legal," Caitlin Knowles Myers, an economist at Middlebury College and author of a new study, recently said to The New York Times. "Affluent women generally find a way to get there, but 75 percent of abortion patients are poor or near-poor."
If Roe v. Wade were struck down, one expert painted a bleak picture for Arkansas residents.
"I don't think anyone in Massachusetts is going to find any difference in their life as a result," Phillip Levine, an economist at Wellesley College and a leading researcher on the topic, recently told The Times. "But if you're in Arkansas or Nebraska, if you don't have means, it's going to be virtually impossible for you to get an abortion legally."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: You had to become an "honorary white."
That was the status South Africa used to bestow upon black performers from the United States who visited the apartheid regime. The O'Jays, Tina Turner, Ray Charles and Eartha Kitt were among those who received that designation, allowing them access to hotels and restaurants from which black Africans were barred.
It was, as you might expect, a controversial thing. Or as Eddie Levert of the O'Jays later observed, "We've been apologizing ever since."
While there is no official "honorary white" status in this country, American politics has evolved a rough analog. As lily-white conservatism has lurched deeper into a brazen racism and xenophobia reminiscent of the 1950s, black and brown people willing to use their color to give it moral cover have seen themselves eagerly embraced by those whose sins they abet.
It's not quite access to "whites only" hotels and restaurants, but it is acceptance into white spaces otherwise closed and hostile to people like you. Sometimes, it even brings a kind of petty stardom in the murky world of right-wing bloggers, social media and cable news. Racist xenophobes get to feel that they're not racist or xenophobic at all because, hey, "Diamond and Silk" agree with them.
But ultimately, the joke is always on you. In recent days, we've seen that lesson learned painfully and publicly by two men: a black Donald Trump voter named Kevin Martin and a Donald Trump friend of Puerto Rican heritage named Geraldo Rivera.
The former told CNN last week that when Trump told four congresswomen of color to "go back" to their countries, it "just came out of left field" and "hit a lot of us in the gut." The latter, while loyally insisting Trump has "been treated unfairly," conceded to The New York Times that, "As much as I have denied it and averted my eyes from it, this latest incident made it impossible."
To which, the only appropriate response is: Wow. Just ... wow.
After the housing discrimination suits, the quote about black laziness, the persecution of the Central Park Five, now it's suddenly "impossible" for Rivera to deny Trump's bigotry? After the Mexican rapists crack, the smear against a Mexican-American judge, the Muslim ban, the "very fine people on both sides," Martin thinks Trump's latest rancid spew "came out of left field"?!
One can only conclude that honorary whiteness must be one powerful drug. Side effects include cultural amnesia and inability to process reality.
It's not that people of color can't or shouldn't be conservative, as that term was once understood. But this modern iteration doesn't care about small government or muscular diplomacy. Rather, it is working to normalize racism and enshrine xenophobia, and if you're black or brown and still don't realize that, well, again, wow.
The thing is, honorary whiteness has its limitations. Consider Barry Martin, an honorary-white black dancer who toured South Africa in 1983 and was in a single-car accident while there. An ambulance picked up the white driver, but left Martin in the wreckage. A black motorist happened by and took him to a white hospital where he was refused admission. Eventually, Martin wound up in the black section of another hospital.
Somewhere in all that jostling, his injured spine was severed. Martin became a quadriplegic. He never walked, much less danced, again.
Take his story as an object lesson, you honorary whites of American politics: You are not special, only useful.
You'd be wise to learn the difference.

Morgenthau, iconic ex-Manhattan district attorney, dies at 99

Texto completo: Nation
- Former Manhattan District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau, who spent more than three decades jailing criminals from mob kingpins and drug-dealing killers to a tax-dodging Harvard dean, died Sunday. He was 99, just 10 days short of his 100th birthday.
Morgenthau died at Manhattan's Lenox Hill Hospital after a short illness, his wife, Lucinda Franks, told the New York Times.
Morgenthau, who served as U.S. Attorney for New York's southern district during the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, returned to law enforcement as Manhattan's top state prosecutor in 1975 and held the job for 35 years.
For all his successes winning convictions, Morgenthau also became known for presiding over an injustice, and then correcting it.
Thirteen years after his prosecutors sent five black and Hispanic teenagers to prison for the rape of a female jogger in what was originally described as a gang "wilding" spree, Morgenthau asked a judge in 2002 to throw out the convictions after DNA evidence and another man's confession put them into question.
The "Central Park 5" were later paid $41 million for the time they wrongfully spent behind bars.
Toddler's family suing cruise line
INDIANAPOLIS - There are "a million things" the cruise company could have done to prevent the death of an 18-month-old Indiana girl who fell to her death from an open window on a cruise ship in Puerto Rico, the toddler's mother said in an interview broadcast Monday.
Speaking publicly for the first time since Chloe Wiegand died, her mother, Kimberley Wiegand, told NBC's "Today" show that her family will sue Royal Caribbean Cruises for "not having a safer situation on the 11th floor of that cruise ship."
Michael Winkleman, the family's attorney, has challenged a Puerto Rico police report that says Chloe Wiegand's grandfather dropped the toddler out of a window July 7 when the Freedom of the Seas was docked in Puerto Rico. Winkleman has said Chloe asked her grandfather to lift her up so she could bang on the glass in a children's play area and that she fell through the window that had inexplicably been left open.
"There are a million things that could've been done to make that safer. I know my mom was asking people, 'Why on earth is there a window open on the 11th floor without a screen or anything?'" said Wiegand, of South Bend, Indiana. She said the company told her family the window was open for ventilation.
"There's no doubt this was an accident," Winkleman said. "Really the singular question is, were there safety measures that could have been in place and should have been in place? If they were in place, again, there would have been no tragedy."

Texto completo: As an adult and before I went to Library School to get my Master's Degree (yes, there is such a thing as Library School), I rarely visited a library.
Gasp!
I picked up books for a quarter at a garage sale or got them passed along from friends. Even when I started using the public library again as an adult, I placed holds for the items I wanted, walked inside, picked up my holds and left. My information needs were small but I still valued the public library. Just because I did not need the library did not mean that others had no need for it.
I grew up regularly using a public library but as I got older I did not need to visit as much. As a child, my mom would drop me at the door to the library and leave me unattended while she did the weekly shopping. My hometown was so small that we were allowed to store our library cards in a drawer of the card catalog.
How times have changed.
In some ways, libraries and librarians are the same as when I was a kid. Librarians can assist you with an informational need, they can recommend a good book to read, and can often point you in the right direction if you have non-library questions. They can guide you to job-searching websites, resume templates, and reputable health research sources.
Librarians are like information wizards. Technically, we are Information Scientists, always anticipating your needs.
When we do outreach in the community, we hear things like "I never use the library," or "I haven't been to the library since I was a kid," or "The library has nothing for me," along with "Where is the library?"
Sadly, that question has been asked by someone standing across the parking lot from the library. Multiple times.
If you have not visited the library since you were a kid, you might be surprised to know about all the services we offer.
We hosted over 300 programs last year, from computer classes, to nature and health lectures. We offer programs for all ages, from toddlers to seniors. We coordinate a high school diploma program.
Over 200,000 people visited our library last year.
Specifically at the Palm Springs Public Library, we have over 100,000 physical items, including an excellent foreign film collection on DVD. We have both physical magazines you can check out plus a digital collection of popular magazines you can download and keep.
We have streaming films and TV series through subscriptions to Acorn TV and Kanopy, all free with your library card. We also have downloadable music that is yours to keep and eBooks that are both very popular.
If you have more scientific research to do, you can use our subscription to Explora, a database of full-text, scholarly journal articles from Ebsco. We recently added a subscription to New York Times online, again free of charge with your library card.
You do not even have to visit the library for some services, once you make that initial visit to get a library card.
You do not have to be a Palm Springs resident to get a library card. Any resident of California can obtain a free library card from PSPL.
We even went fine free last year. You no longer have any excuses.
I challenge you to visit your local library, especially the Palm Springs Public Library.
We are not your grandmother's library.
But we still have books!

10 killed, 5 missing in blast at gas plant
BEIJING — An explosion at a gas plant in central China has killed at least 10 people and seriously injured others, authorities said Saturday. Five people were missing. The explosion on Friday evening, in the city of Yima in Henan province, sent a ball of fire and thick plumes of smoke into the air, according to local state media. The fire charred the factory building, leaving only the frame, the accounts said. As the fire spread, nearby houses collapsed, and windows were shattered as far as 2 miles away, residents said. The explosion occurred in the air separation unit of a factory owned by the Henan Coal Gas (Group) Co., according to Xinhua, the state-run news agency. No explanation was given for the explosion.

British Airways halts Cairo flights
LONDON — British Airways abruptly canceled all flights to Cairo on Saturday for what it described as security reasons, a day after the British government warned against traveling to some parts of Egypt. The airline told passengers at their departure gate in London that they could not fly. “We constantly review our security arrangements at all our airports around the world," the airline said in a statement, “and have suspended flights to Cairo for seven days as a precaution to allow for further assessment." British Airways did not describe the security issue. The British government released new travel advice for Egypt on Friday, warning against trips to most of the Sinai Peninsula and the area west of the Nile Valley and saying that travelers to Cairo should be cautious, too. “There's a heightened risk of terrorism against aviation," the government said.

Bosnia-Herzegovina
Funeral held for mass killing victims
PRIJEDOR — Several thousand people attended a funeral service in Bosnia on Saturday for 86 Muslims who were slain by Serbs in one of the worst atrocities of the country's 1992-95 war. Relatives of the victims, religious leaders, and others gathered at a soccer stadium near the eastern town of Prijedor, standing solemnly behind lines of coffins draped with green cloths. The victims ranged in age from 19 to 61. They were among some 200 Bosnian Muslims and Croats from Prijedor who were massacred in August 1992 on a cliff on Mt. Vlasic known as Koricanske Stijene. The victims were shot and killed by the edge of the cliff, their bodies falling into the abyss. The Serbs later threw bombs onto the bodies, which made identifying the victims difficult. The United Nations war crimes tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia sentenced several ex-Bosnian Serb policemen for separating civilians from a convoy of people being deported from Prijedor and killing them.

Texto completo: Jeffrey Sterling was a man without a country.
It was May 2016 and the former CIA spy was watching television in the Federal Correctional Institution in Englewood, Colorado. He was in the black TV room.
In prison, Sterling says, everything was segregated. There was a black TV room, a white TV room, a Hispanic TV room.
Sterling is a Missouri native. He wanted to watch the St. Louis Blues in the Western Conference finals. Some of his fellow inmates were upset that a black man wanted to watch hockey.
This is the story of Sterling's life. Growing up in a poor, black neighborhood in Cape Girardeau as the youngest son of an unloving mother, wanting to go to college, maybe even law school, Sterling wasn't black enough.
In the CIA, he wasn't white enough.
In 2015 Sterling was convicted of violating the Espionage Act for allegedly leaking classified information to New York Times reporter James Risen about a mission in Iran to disrupt the development of nuclear technology. The case made Risen famous. Sterling became the Unwanted Spy.
That's the name of his book, due out Oct. 15, about his life, his time in the CIA, and his trial, in which the government didn't produce any direct evidence of that which Sterling maintains he didn't do.
"The only thing that the government proved beyond a reasonable doubt," says the man with a law degree from Washington University, "is that I was black."
To be sure, he complained to the Senate Intelligence Committee about what he believed was a botched and ill-fated mission, after his reports to CIA higher-ups fell on deaf ears. And he had previously filed a discrimination lawsuit against the CIA which wasn't allowed to go to trial for national security reasons.
Today, he's back home, living in O'Fallon, Missouri, with his wife, Holly, their two cats, and a sense of freedom that he can't yet put into words. As of Wednesday, he is no longer on probation, has no travel restrictions, doesn't need to ask the federal government for permission for anything.
"I'm still adjusting," Sterling says. "It's been so long."
Indeed, he's been under a dark cloud of suspicion since he first sought redress for discrimination in 2000. Sterling filed a lawsuit in 2001, was fired shortly thereafter, and became one of numerous targets under the administration of President Barack Obama to be prosecuted for alleged leaks to the press.
For Sterling, the episode was yet another in a long line of situations where he found himself on the outside, a man without an identity, a proud black man reaching for the American Dream and being blocked from it at every turn. That struggle for an identity, for a country -- even his own family -- to accept him, is a recurring theme in his book, some of which he wrote while in prison.
"It's an American story," Sterling says. "It's one man's journey through the shades of America."
It's not a journey that took Sterling where he thought he'd end up.
He joined the CIA after answering an ad in the Post-Dispatch. He learned Farsi and thought he was prepared to be a successful case officer overseas. Then he ended up being given a "cover" by the agency, he writes in his book, that didn't allow him access to the diplomatic circles where he could be successful. As all the white officers at his level got more typical diplomatic covers, he asked over and over again for the agency to put him in a position to be successful. It never happened.
So he sued, knowing full well the power of the American government was going to come down on him.
"All I know how to do is fight and stand up for myself," he says. "I would not have been able to look myself in the mirror if I didn't."
He lost his job. He and his first wife lost a baby. She left him.
He came back to Missouri, met Holly, found a job he liked, and then the CIA put his life on hold, seeking a scapegoat for one embarrassing chapter in Risen's bestselling "State of War."
"My biggest fear growing up was that I didn't want to go to prison," he says. "That's where I ended up."
He didn't fit in there, either.
Not black enough. Not white enough. Not free enough.
But it was there, also, that he reconnected with the goodness of America that today gives him hope. Due in part to Holly's advocacy for him -- she's the reason I knew about his case and wrote about him in September 2015 -- people from all over the country corresponded with Sterling. They sent him books, letters and cards; they told him about their lives and helped him deal with the daily monotony of prison.
"The America I thought didn't exist came to me in prison," Sterling says.
It's a hopeful turn to a story for which the ending has yet to be written.

Texto completo: At 4:17 p.m. Eastern time on July 20, 1969, Mike Epstein stood 90 feet from home plate and some 238,000 miles from the moon.
With the Washington Senators and New York Yankees tied at 2 in the eighth inning of their series finale at Yankee Stadium, Epstein, a Bronx native, had one thing on his mind. It wasn't Apollo 11's lunar descent.
"I wasn't concerned with it," Epstein, now 76, said from his home outside of Denver last month. "I was concerned about scoring a run."
An estimated 650 million watched Neil Armstrong take man's first step on the moon more than six hours later, but during the lunar landing, 32,933 were in the stands at Yankee Stadium on the Sunday before the All-Star break. Ken McMullen dug in against Jack Aker with Epstein on third, a man on first and no outs. Most scheduled sports programs were preempted by coverage of Apollo 11's progress, but Washington's WWDC Radio carried the Senators-Yankees game with short reports on the moon mission.
"The 1-1 pitch to McMullen, swung on, hit foul down the third base side," intoned WWDC play-by-play man Rex Barney, the former Brooklyn Dodgers pitcher. "One ball, two strikes now."
BEEP. BEEP. BEEP. BEEP. BEEP. BEEP. BEEP.
As the umpires, according to prior arrangements, waved their arms and stopped play, an urgent voice came over the radio: "Here is a bulletin from WWDC News, Apollo 11 is 100 feet from the surface of the moon. We now switch live to the manned spacecraft center."
Similar interruptions took place on radio stations and at stadiums across Major League Baseball as the sport paused to direct everyone's attention toward the moon. At Montreal's Jarry Park, the Mets and Expos took an extended break between games of their doubleheader so the 27,356 in attendance could listen to coverage of the landing over the stadium's public address system. In Chicago, Comiskey Park's exploding scoreboard shot sparks when the lunar module touched down, which happened to coincide with Walt Williams' infield single to lead off the bottom of the seventh inning. And the Yankees-Senators game was stopped for four minutes to celebrate the accomplishment.
Barney was reading out-of-town scores when WWDC returned to coverage from Yankee Stadium, where public address announcer Bob Sheppard was sharing the historic news with the crowd.
"Ladies and gentleman, your attention please," Sheppard said. "You will be happy to know that the Apollo 11 has landed safely on the moon."
The cheers from the crowd drowned out the final two words of Sheppard's announcement, but the message displayed on the scoreboard in right-center field was loud and clear: "THEYRE ON THE MOON."
"I'm sure you heard it in the background," Barney said. "The announcement and the game being paused, Apollo 11 has landed safely on the moon. That's what the cheering and applause was for. They're on the moon right now. And it's a standing ovation, very inspiring, and I'll tell you one thing, sitting here and broadcasting this game, and watching the players, I think there's only one thing going through everyone's mind... . As I sit here and I have been all weekend long, really, and I think my thoughts along with everyone else has just been of those people that are on the moon. They're there, right now."
The cheering at Yankee Stadium continued for about 45 seconds, according to The New York Times, as thousands of children waved the Hillerich & Bradsby Co. Louisville Sluggers they received on Bat Day.
"On the field, the players seemed confused, or impatient," Leonard Koppett wrote in the Times. "Most did not turn toward the scoreboard. Finally, the announcer could be understood, and he asked the crowd for a moment of silent prayer for the safe return of the astronauts."
After a few seconds of silence, a recording of "America the Beautiful" played over the Yankee Stadium loudspeaker. The crowd sang and then cheered some more.

What's the best approach to boost your 401(k)? Active, passive or a little of both?

Resumen: Everyone has an investing strategy, but the best option includes employing both active and passive management of your portfolio.

Texto completo: .
The late, great Jack Bogle of Vanguard once called passive investment “the greatest invention in the history of finance. ”
His legendary career thrived upon this premise. Now, conventional wisdom commonly believes passive management beats active – and fund managers aren’t worth their fees. Yet a recent study of active manager performance by consulting firm Wilshire Associates debunks parts of this belief. Many active managers actually did very well this last decade.
I’m not arguing here for active or passive. But how and why some active managers achieved their success offers you actionable tips to deploy in your 401(k) or other retirement portfolios.
Passive’s prophets primarily presume active equals stock-picking. They rightly argue markets are too efficient for anyone to repeatedly pinpoint needles in our stock market haystack. Yet, whether an active manager outperforms is less about getting stock picks right than about identifying – and capitalizing on – a benchmark’s quirks (like those of the Standard & Poor's 500 or any index).
Move over, Bill: Gates lost his title as world's second richest person, says Bloomberg
What happens if the Fed cuts rates?: How your credit cards, home equity lines and bank savings would be affected
Take the 1990s, as Japan’s stock market bubble burst. Any globally diversified investor (which you should be) could beat that decade just underweighting Japanese stocks. Japan started 1990 totaling half the money value of the world’s stock market. Crazy! You needed nothing else to beat the world than underweighting Japan. Speculating on dot-com IPOs? Unnecessary. Just that one big-picture decision was enough.
View Wilshire’s study in this light, and its findings aren’t surprising. For instance, 79% of small-cap growth managers beat their indexes over the past five years. Skill? No. This, too, is wonkiness. The biggest stock in MSCI’s US Small Cap Growth Index has a market capitalization of $10. 2 billion. Many small-cap managers own much bigger, but still relatively small stocks. Why? It’s less strategy and more necessity.
Most fund firms struggle to trade tiny stocks without moving the price significantly. So they end up owning many stocks bigger than their benchmarks. When larger stocks beat smaller ones – as they have lately – active small-cap managers outperform. It would be weird if most of them hadn’t beaten their benchmarks with the wind to larger stocks’ backs.
Tech for babies: Lumi by Pampers combines parental insight with data to establish routine for baby
This also explains why their relative returns were worse going further back – small stocks beat big ones early in this bull market, as they usually do early on. Managers’ skewing to slightly larger stocks hurt them then as this bull market launched. A few lousy years early! A few great ones later! Cycles happen.
Going passive is cheap, smart and often truly better as Bogle always said. But Wilshire’s report shows the benefits of hedging passiveness based on style and size. Be passive with one chunk and active in another to avoid index craziness.
The trick? Understanding index quirks. Most major index providers like MSCI, S&P or Russell offer online fact sheets detailing their indexes’ construction. These tools help you spot crazy wonkiness to hedge against.
Expecting U. S. stocks to hugely lead or lag foreign ones? Then adjust your U. S. holdings above or below America’s 63% global weight. Or maybe lower them down to 55% or up to 70%. Many readers probably think underweighting America now is stupid, given we’ve beaten foreign stocks lately.
But that is almost 100% due to America’s huge tech dominance. Strip it out – then U. S. and foreign returns nearly match. Expect that to persist? Emphasize tech among American holdings while overweighting non-tech overseas.
You can do all this and more with individual stocks or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) from iShares or State Street’s SPDR. Actively avoiding crazy extremes isn’t crazy. Be passive and active – just be proactive, not reactive.

Texto completo: Measurement is only half the battle. To really drive change, you also need a mechanism to hold yourself accountable. The easiest approach for most people — an accountability buddy.
When we look to initiate change or growth, some sort of behavior shift is generally required.
Want to sell more products? Probably involves making more cold calls, training more sales people, or improving marketing efforts.
Looking to remain relevant in the workforce? Likely this objective will require more learning, reading, or skill development.
Whether our objectives are business or personal, the odds of achieving success dramatically increase when we embrace two important steps in tandem:
1. Track and measure the specific behaviors needed to drive change.
The simple act of measuring progress — or keeping score — is one of the most powerful ways to drive results. As they say, "what gets measured gets improved."
About two years ago, I decided to improve my nutrition to boost my health, fitness and vitality. This notion didn't require genius; we all know we should eat more veggies and fewer french fries. We all already know the answer, yet so many of us fail to shift behavior. For me, the results were achieved by logging my food intake on a simple mobile app. Yes, it took some getting used to, but today my nutrition is better than ever. The consistency and results were greatly enhanced by tracking my behavior.
The same happened this year when I declared 2019 as a "year of learning." I set a goal to read a minimum of 3.5 hours per week on a variety of topics to boost my knowledge, skills, and understanding of the world. Without tracking, it would have likely ended up like most New Year's resolutions: dead on arrival. But since I track my reading on a simple mobile app in 20 minute segments, it's helped me stay focused and on track.
2. Build in accountability.
Measurement is only half the battle. To really drive change, you also need a mechanism to hold yourself accountable. The easiest approach for most people — an accountability buddy.
For my nutrition shift, I persuaded a friend who happens to be a metabolic doctor to let me email him my food intake report every day. The poor guy has received over 500 emails from me, but the fact that I have to send it each night keeps me accountable for my behavior commitments. For this year's learning efforts, I teamed up with a colleague and we email each other our weekly "learning accountability" results. Seven months later, both of us are still on track.
Measurement plus accountability is the secret formula to achieve nearly any behavior change. One without the other is like Bert without Ernie; Garfunkel without Simon; Bonnie without Clyde.
Yet when these two forces are combined, your chances of enacting long-term results skyrocket.
If you're ready to make a long-awaiting change, embrace the one-two punch of measurement and accountability. The results will be a better fusion than peanut butter and chocolate, delivering you an absolutely delicious result.

Texto completo: Former Life magazine photographer Ida Wyman, who moved to Madison from New York City in 2006, quickly making friends and photos, died Saturday at Agrace HospiceCare in Fitchburg. She was 93.
"You can't create what happens in the world, but sometimes you see it," Wyman told a Wisconsin State Journal reporter in 2014 at age 88 before an exhibit of her work at the James Watrous Gallery in Overture Center for the Arts.
Wyman's work was featured on the cover of Life magazine and is included in the New York Museum of Modern Art's collection. The New York Times ran an obituary on Wyman on its website Friday.
Martha Glowacki, who was director of the James Watrous Gallery at the time of Wyman's exhibition, got to know her well while curating the show, and kept in contact with her afterwards, even attending her 90th birthday party at Hotel RED.
"She was really a gifted photographer," Glowacki said. "She was just kind of an indomitable person and really was someone who valued connections with people when she did her photography."
She did a lot of photography on the streets of New York, and would always ask permission before she photographed people. In talking with them, she made real connections, Glowacki said. "So when you look at those photographs, she had formed some kind of a personal bond with those people and that's how she went through her life."
Wyman's granddaughter, Heather Garrison, of Fitchburg, brought her grandmother to Madison, and even though she was 80 at the time, she adjusted quickly, and was glad to have more space.
"She was happy to move here. She had a condo and was able to have a small garden," Garrison said. "Certainly, she was sad to leave New York, but she (was) an amazing woman and she made a ton of connections here in Madison."
One connection she made was with the Beth Israel Center on Madison's Near West Side. She joined the congregation a year after moving to Madison, said Elissa Pollack, Beth Israel's executive director. "She was quite a woman," Pollack said. "She was kind and a little surprising sometimes."
Because Wyman was humble, Pollack said she was amazed to later find out about her career at Life magazine, for which she did more than 100 assignments in the 1940s and early 1950s.
In November 1950, Life magazine sent Wyman to the set of "Bedtime for Bonzo," a film with a chimpanzee in the title role, and the actor and future president Ronald Reagan.
"He supposedly understood 500 commands," Wyman said of Bonzo in a 2011 State Journal story. "He was short, like a little kid, but his grip was something else. He'd chatter at me, and I'd chatter back. He was very friendly."
Reagan was friendly, too, she said.
Wyman was a member of New York's Photo League, which encouraged documentary-style photographs of the gritty realities of ordinary New Yorkers.
She got her start in the high school camera club, growing up in the Bronx, where her parents, immigrants from Latvia, were grocers. "Usually cash poor," Wyman told the State Journal in 2011. "It took a lot of coaxing to get my father to give me $5 for my first camera."
Her first job was not as a photographer, but in the mailroom of Acme Newspictures, where she later became its first woman printer. She was fired in 1945 when men returned to their jobs after World War II. That's when Wyman began pitching photos to magazines like Look, Life and Business Week.
She interrupted her photo career to raise her children. In 1969, no longer married, she took a job as chief photographer with the Department of Pathology at Columbia University. In 1983, after a cancer scare, Wyman revived her photojournalism career.
Art historian Melanie Herzog, who collaborated with Wyman for the catalog that accompanied her 2014 exhibit in Madison, said Wyman had a unique way of documenting what she encountered wherever she went.
"Out of sheer curiosity, she saw the extraordinary in what most of us would see as ordinary," Herzog said. CREDIT: SAMARA KALK DERBY skalk@madison.com

Texto completo: Un juez federal se mostró dispuesto a aprobar un acuerdo preliminar presentado este viernes por el que la cadena de hospedaje Motel 6 pagará 10 millones de dólares, y que sería el punto final de una querella interpuesta tras descubrirse que se compartía información de huéspedes con ICE .
El juez David Campbell señaló a los abogados de ambas partes que una vez se entregue la documentación requerida para finales de este mes no tendría objeciones en aprobar el acuerdo preliminar, que eleva la cifra previa de 7.6 millones alcanzado entre la organización civil MALDEF y la cadena, y que la Fiscalía había considerado insuficiente.
“Este acuerdo es una gran victoria para nuestra comunidad, envía un fuerte mensaje: Motel 6 violó los derechos de cientos de personas compartiendo su información con ICE ” (Inmigración y Control de Aduanas), dijo a Efe Thomas Saenz, presidente del Fondo Mexicano Estadounidense para la Defensa Legal (MALDEF).
La compensación monetaria en esta demanda colectiva, en la que se denunció que empleados de la cadena entregaban información de los huéspedes a ICE, dependerá de si los afectados fueron cuestionados, arrestados o inclusive deportados. También si tenían hijos menores o familiares que fueron afectados por su detención.
Como parte de este nuevo acuerdo se eleva la compensación monetaria para aquellos que fueron víctimas de esta práctica, y en todos los hoteles de la cadena en Arizona y no solo unos cuantos que fueron mencionados en el primer acuerdo.
Aquellos cuyo nombre fue entregado a ICE en 2017 cuando se hospedaron en Motel 6, recibirán ahora 75 dólares, 25 dólares más que los mencionados en el acuerdo original.
La compensación no excederá los 200,000 dólares por persona .
También se modifico la cantidad que serán otorgadas de este acuerdo a organizaciones que luchan en favor de los migrantes.
Según escritos judiciales, los empleados de Motel 6 entregaban información privada a ICE de aquellos que se registraban utilizando matriculas consulares, pasaportes o identificaciones extranjeras.
Los abogados estiman que el número de víctimas se podría incrementar hasta 50,000 .
Saenz indicó que a partir de agosto comenzará un periodo de gracia donde aquellos que no estén conformes con este nuevo acuerdo podrán apelar, y quienes consideren que fueron víctimas de Motel 6 también se podrían agregar a la demanda.
Por su parte, la oficina del Fiscal del Estado de Arizona, Mark Brnovich dijo a Efe que revisaran el nuevo acuerdo.
El pasado mes de mayo, Brnovich pidió a la corte rechazar el primer acuerdo debido a que lo consideraba injusto para las víctimas, porque iban a recibir muy poco dinero.

Texto completo: LONDON - Jet2, a British budget airline and tour operator, said it had fined a passenger about $106,000 after her behavior aboard a flight to Turkey last month prompted military jets to escort the plane back to an airport near London.
The evening flight from Stansted Airport, north of London, to Dalaman, a coastal town in southwestern Turkey, was cut short June 22 after a 25-year-old passenger, Chloe Haines of Maidenhead, England, "displayed a catalog of aggressive, abusive and dangerous behavior," the airline said in a statement Tuesday.
Her erratic conduct, which included attempting to open the plane doors during the flight, "was one of the most serious cases of disruptive passenger behavior that we have experienced," Steve Heapy, the airline's chief executive, said in the statement.
Two Typhoon fighter jets from the Royal Air Force were called to escort the aircraft back to Stansted Airport, Jet2 said.
"She must now face up to the consequences of her actions, and we will vigorously pursue to recover the costs that we incurred," Heapy said.
In addition to the fine, Haines has also been banned for life from the airline.
The crew of the June 22 flight restrained Haines with the help of other passengers while the plane was over the North Sea, a spokesman for the airline said by email Thursday.
After the plane returned to Stansted, police officers boarded the plane and arrested the 25-year-old woman from Maidenhead on suspicion of common assault, criminal damage and endangering an aircraft, the Essex Police said on Twitter last month.
Sarah Stewart, an aviation lawyer in London, said that there had been a sharp increase in disruptive behavior on planes. From 2007 to 2015, there were over 49,000 reported cases of "unruly passenger incidents onboard aircraft in flight," she said in an email Thursday.
Stewart said that costs for forced plane reroutings typically ranged from 10,000 pounds to 80,000 pounds, or about $12,400 to $99,300, "depending on the size of the aircraft and where it diverts to."
She added that offenders could face large fines and lifetime bans, like those issued to Haines, and even imprisonment, but that the punishment for the disruption depended on the severity of the act.
"Acts of drunkenness on an aircraft face a maximum fine of 5,000 euros and two years in prison," she said. "The prison sentence for endangering the safety of an aircraft is up to five years; disruptive passengers can be asked to reimburse the airline the costs resulting from their disruptive behavior, including the cost for diversions, damage to aircraft and delays.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump wants credit for the economic progress in Rhode Island, sending a series of tweets Friday attacking New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman over a recent column that argued Democrats running for president have moved too far left, a column which also praised Democratic Governor Gina Raimondo.
Trump complained that Friedman was pleasant to him during a phone call, but subsequently criticized him in the column, titled 'Trump's Going to Get Re-elected, Isn't He?'
Trump also complained that he was not given credit for improvement in Rhode Island's economy. Under Raimondo, unemployment dropped from 6.6 percent in January 2015 to 3.6 percent in May.
Friedman had used Rhode Island's example to argue for a more centrist Democrat to rise to the top of the presidential contender pack, or risk another four years of Trump.
“It will be an overthrow of all the norms, values, rules and institutions that we cherish, that made us who we are and that have united us in this common project called the United States of America," Friedman warned of a two-term Trump presidency.

Policy for Breastfeeding on Flights Draws Backlash

Texto completo: LONDON -- The Dutch airline KLM has found itself in the middle of a heated debate over breastfeeding in public, after the company said it might ask women to cover themselves while breastfeeding onboard if other passengers said they were offended.
The issue came to light after Shelby Angel, a woman from Sacramento, Calif., wrote about her experience on a KLM flight this summer in a post on Facebook on Sunday.
"Before we even took off, I was approached by a flight attendant carrying a blanket," she wrote, saying she was told that if she wanted to breastfeed her 1-year-old daughter, she should cover up. When Ms. Angel refused, she said, the crew member told her that if anyone complained, it would be for Ms. Angel to deal with.
Nobody complained, Ms. Angel said.
As the post spread online, other social media users turned to Twitter to confront the airline. KLM's response has been consistent: Breastfeeding is allowed onboard as long as no other passengers are offended by the practice.
"To ensure that all our passengers of all backgrounds feel comfortable on board, we may request a mother to cover herself while breastfeeding, should other passengers be offended by this," the airline wrote in a post on Twitter on Tuesday.
Breastfeeding in public has been the subject of a decades-long debate, with some arguing that it is a natural practice and others saying that it's a matter of public decency. In 1975, The New York Times called the practice a "growing trend," quoting a woman who said she was not embarrassed to nurse her son in a restaurant or at a dinner party.
More recently, the debate has motivated prominent figures to stand up for the right to do what they consider normal and natural. In 2017, a photo of Larissa Waters, an Australian senator who breastfed her baby in Parliament, attracted attention around the world.
Some experts even recommend breastfeeding during a flight's takeoff and landing to ease the pressure in the baby's ears.
Yet even as the sight of mothers feeding their babies in public places has become more common in the West, women have continued to be shamed and belittled.
Some countries have introduced legal protection for women's right to breastfeed in public. All 50 states in the United States have laws that specifically allow women to breastfeed in any public or private place. And in Britain, among other countries, it is illegal to ask a breastfeeding woman to leave a public place such as a restaurant or on public transportation.
KLM's Twitter post on Tuesday drew thousands of responses, many of them stunned and furious, asking the airline to change its policy -- or pledging never to fly with the company again.
"Breast feeding is the most natural thing in the world and shouldn't make anyone of any culture uncomfortable," Catherine Noone, deputy leader of the Irish Senate, wrote on Wednesday. "Shocking response from KLM."
"For the comfort of passengers from racist or homophobic backgrounds would they ask people to cover skin and identifiers?" asked Chris van Tulleken, a doctor in London, in a post on Thursday.
Others, like Becca Brettschneider, a nurse from Virginia, called the airline's approach "not an unreasonable request."
As questions kept coming in, KLM repeated its message. On Thursday, a spokeswoman did not reply to a request for comment.
Some Twitter users turned to KLM's competitors to ask about their own breastfeeding policies.
British Airways wrote in a response on Thursday: "We carry thousands of infants and their families on our flights every year, and we welcome breastfeeding on board."

Texto completo: The quirky romantic comedy " Hampstead " - which opened in Europe two years ago but is only now making it to our shores - stars Diane Keaton as a lonely widow who begins a relationship with an eccentric hermit (Brendan Gleeson) who lives in a shack in a remote corner of a London park. If the premise, which also involves a campaign to save the man's home from rapacious developers, sounds far-fetched, the New York Times nevertheless calls it a "lively" and "unfussy" tale. This "pleasant rattle of a film" makes fine use of its likable leads, the Times wrote, and ultimately "goes down easy." PG-13. At the Cinema Arts Theatre. Contains some suggestive material and strong language. 102 minutes.

Belfast musical of 'The Secret Garden' is a visually lush production of a flawed script

Texto completo: The Belfast Maskers is doing what the midcoast theater group has done for more than 30 years -- tackling challenging material and creating theatrical magic with local talent.
Its summer production of the musical "The Secret Garden" is a visually lush, beautifully acted piece, lovingly presented to the community like a fragrant bouquet. But as hard as the company tries, it cannot overcome the flaws in the script, which focuses too much on ghosts and grownups and too little on the children.
Frances Hodgson Burnett's 1911 novel is a beloved classic about Mary Lennox, a girl torn from her home in India after her parents' deaths and transplanted to the English countryside to live with an uncle on the Moors. The girl unearths many secrets at the manor, including a bed-ridden cousin and a walled-off garden, from which the novel took its name.
This musical version of the story, with book and lyrics by Marsha Norman and music by Lucy Simon, premiered on Broadway in 1991. New York Times theater critic Frank Rich said in his review that: "'The Secret Garden' favors theme over story, as if it were a learned essay about the book instead of a new version that might speak for itself." Despite that apt description, Norman won a Tony award for best book for a musical.
[image id="2842789" size="full" pos="center" /]
Maskers' director Erik Perkins cast the production with some fine local talent, including Eric Sanders as grieving widower Archibald, Scott Anthony Smith as his physician brother Neville and Sarah Hughes as Lily, the woman both men loved. Their strong performances and beautiful voices help lift this production above the mediocre material.
It is the children that give "The Secret Garden" its charm and finest moments. Marina Bannister is convincing and delightful as the lonely and displaced Mary Lennox. Her transformation from spoiled and demanding brat to independent gardener is wonderful to watch. This young actress gives a performance as fine as the more seasoned adults in the cast.
Walden Merkel Cutting as Mary's cousin Colin and Chris Hayes as free spirit Dickon are convincing in their roles, but both need to slow down and articulate more precisely so theatergoers can better understand them. Both actors perfectly bring to life Burnett's boys.
The cast member who best captures the spirit of the book is Scott Taylor as aging gardener Ben Weatherstaff. He brings to the stage the humor and elation of Burnett's story that the musical's creators lost. He is a joy to watch.
[image id="2842788" size="full" pos="center" /]
In addition to directing, Perkins designed the multi-pieced set that includes a rotating revolve. One side of the set pieces are three-dimensional and look like the stone walls of the garden. On the other side are rooms inside the dark, unwelcoming mansion.
The costumes, designed by Linda Marie, are equally beautiful. They set the show squarely in the Victorian age. Which class each character belongs to is immediately signaled by the clothes they wear.
The sets, costumes and lighting design by Dave Fournier are exceptionally fine and make this show a feast for the eyes. Perkins' attention to these details make this production of "The Secret Garden" visually perfect.
One place the Maskers skimped on (and shouldn't have) was in the number of musicians used. The score requires an orchestra of 15 players that is heavy on the strings and brass. By using just a keyboard, percussionist and woodwinds, music director Deb Fournier lost the richness of the music.
A story about renewal and revival was a great choice for the Belfast Maskers after the group last summer bought the former Universalist Church at 17 Court St., built in 1839. The building has been named the Basil Burwell Community Theater, nicknamed "The Bazz," after the maskers' founder.
The company, which performed in different venues around town after losing its waterfront home in 2011, has been working to insulate the building so productions can be mounted in the winter months. It also should consider either opening windows or adding fans to circulate air in summer. The theater was stiflingly hot during Saturday night's performance.
Despite the flaws in the script, the Maskers deserve applause for tackling such a difficult and complex musical. The casting and technical execution of "The Secret Garden" prove that the company can again be a shining jewel of excellence in Maine's community theater scene.
"The Secret Garden" will be performed at 7 p.m. Thursday through Saturday and at 3 p.m. Sunday at the Basil Burwell Community Theater, 17 Court St., Belfast. For more information, visit belfastmaskers.com or call 207-619-3256.

Texto completo: ISTANBUL -- President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has marked the anniversary of a failed coup against him every passing year -- this week was the third -- with a national holiday that has turned the traumatic event into a celebration of Turkish nationalism.
But this year, Mr. Erdogan had even more to cheer about, as he flaunted an extra-special symbol of national pride, the S-400 missile defense system that had just arrived from Russia.
"As long as we, as a nation, protect our homeland, our flag, the call for prayer, democracy and the state," he declared at a ceremony at Ataturk Airport Monday, "God willing, no power's hand will be able to reach them."
Over his 17 years in power, Mr. Erdogan has tried to recast Turkey as a stronger, more independent actor on the international stage, one that in his view can vie toe to toe with powers like China, Russia, the European Union and the United States.
In doing so, he has not been afraid to play all sides against each other, even at the risk of alienating longtime allies as his apparent double-dealing stirs consternation in Europe and America about whose side he is actually on.
The short answer is, his own.
If there is an underlying message in the deal, it may be about Mr. Erdogan's deep-seated suspicion that Washington was behind the attempt to overthrow him on the bloody night in 2016, when more than 200 Turks were killed, including one of Mr. Erdogan's closest friends.
"Erdogan no longer trusts Western intentions on Turkey," said Asli Aydintasbas, senior fellow with the European Council on Foreign Relations. The S-400 purchase wasn't about Russian pressure, she said.
"It is about Turkish fears of another coup," Ms. Aydintasbas said. "Washington has done nothing to address Turkey's suspicions about its role on July 15."
The Turkish government has accused the United States-based cleric Fethullah Gulen of instigating the coup through followers who had infiltrated the ranks of the armed forces, the judiciary and the police.
Washington, citing a lack of evidence, has refused Turkey's repeated demands that Mr. Gulen be extradited. Many Turks see the United States' reluctance to hand over Mr. Gulen as an attempt to protect an American agent.
Mr. Erdogan suggested as much in his speech on Monday.
"July 15 was a different way of trying to put the yoke of slavery on our nation," he said. "Those who think that they can take our nation as slaves through a treacherous gang they planted inside our country, one more time learned their lesson, as it has happened for centuries."
Even so, Mr. Erdogan does not seem ready to rip up old alliances completely, but rather to play with East-West rivalries to get the best deal for Turkey, analysts say. His nationalist posturing is often used in pursuit of driving a harder bargain.
"Washington must give up the misguided notion that our relationship can be asymmetrical and come to terms with the fact that Turkey has alternatives," Mr. Erdogan wrote in an opinion article in The New York Times last year.
"Failure to reverse this trend of unilateralism and disrespect will require us to start looking for new friends and allies," he added.
Even with his purchase of the new Russian missile system, Mr. Erdogan dismissed any suggestion that he was seeking to take Turkey out of the NATO alliance at a news briefing with foreign journalists last month.
But the question confronting Mr. Erdogan's allies in the United States and Europe is whether the purchase of the Russian system is simply a step too far to maintain relations as they have been.
If the purchase does not precipitate a rupture in relations, it may reshape them.
Turkey's purchase of the advanced S-400 system -- reported by the Turkish news media to cost $ 2.5 billion -- represents Mr. Erdogan's most determined step yet to carve out his own vision of an independent, strong Turkey that can rebuff colonial Western powers.
[What is the S-400?]
The United States has strenuously opposed Turkey's purchase of the S-400 system, declaring it incompatible with NATO systems, and is expected to announce sanctions against Turkey as early as this week.
The Pentagon has already halted Turkey's program to purchase American F-35 fighter jets to prevent having them deployed in the same theater as the Russian system. On Tuesday, President Trump said his administration would not sell Turkey any F-35 jets because of its purchase of the Russian system.
"It's a very tough situation that they're in. And it's a very tough situation that we've been placed in the United States," Mr. Trump told reporters. "With all of that being said, we're working through it."
Mr. Erdogan is gambling on his relationship with Mr. Trump to avoid sanctions that have been mandated by Congress. The two leaders discussed the issue at their meeting on the sidelines of the Group of 20 meeting last month in Japan.
Mr. Erdogan also signaled over the weekend that he was ready to negotiate a solution.
His defense minister, Hulusi Akar, said talks continued with Washington over procurement of the American Patriot missile, and Mr. Erdogan emphasized in a speech that the S-400 would not be fully running until April of next year. The actual missiles have not arrived yet, the Turkish news media reported.
The risk in the meantime -- one Mr. Erdogan is keen to highlight -- is that Turkey can cozy up to Russia. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has proved a willing suitor.
Analysts and Turkish officials say the Russian leader has seemingly been more willing than the Americans to hear out Turkish concerns -- even when interests diverge -- and to treat Mr. Erdogan as an equal.
In almost every area where Mr. Trump and the United States have been inflexible or frosty, Mr. Putin has offered dialogue.
Whereas Mr. Trump's Twitter rampages helped sink the Turkish lira last year -- another instance in which Mr. Erdogan saw an American attempt to undermine him -- Mr. Putin is talking trade.
Even in Syria, where the two countries were on opposite sides of the conflict, Mr. Putin has worked to change Turkey from an aggressive opponent to a cooperative partner.
When a Turkish jet shot down a Russian jet that veered into Turkish airspace in November 2015, the event underscored the seeming distance between Russia and Turkey.
The Russian jet was on a bombing mission in support of the Syrian government of Bashar al-Assad. Turkey, along with the United States, was backing the rebels who were being bombed.
But Russia's intervention in Syria turned the war in Mr. Assad's favor, and American support melted away. If anything, Washington began cooperating with Kurdish militias in northeastern Syria that Turkey considers a threat.
Mr. Putin has now brought Mr. Erdogan into his efforts to wind down the war, his so-called Astana process, along with President Hassan Rouhani of Iran.
Together they have established cease-fire zones in Syria to de-escalate the violence and allowed Turkey to establish areas of control in northern Syria to stem the tide of refugees pouring into the country.
But it was Mr. Putin's treatment of Mr. Erdogan after the failed coup that was a critical turning point, said Soner Cagaptay, director of the Turkish Research Program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.
"The coup changed Putin's calculus," he said. The Russian leader called Mr. Erdogan the day after the coup and invited him to Russia. Two weeks after the coup, he hosted Mr. Erdogan at a tsarist palace in St. Petersburg. The S-400s came up in their discussion.
"Putin may have seen that the trauma was so deep," Mr. Cagaptay said, whereas Washington waited four days before it declared sympathy over the coup, and then it was not President Obama who called but Secretary of State John F. Kerry.
"If things had been handled earlier, it would not have happened," Ahmet Han, a professor of international relations at Altinbas University in Istanbul, said of the S-400 deal.
"Turkey's decision makers are jubilant about the receipt" of the S-400s, he added, "but no one is really happy except the Russian lobby."

Texto completo: Procter & Gamble Co. has called out U.S. Soccer on equal pay for women players in a full-page ad in the New York Times, according to the publication.
"Inequality is about more than pay and players," the ad reads. "It's about values."
In addition to siding with the players just months before the women's team is expected to enter mediation for their gender discrimination lawsuit, the Cincinnati-based consumer goods giant donated $529,000 to the team's players association.
P&G sponsors U.S. Soccer through its Secret brand.
The women's team has been fighting for equal pay and treatment for years. Wages, travel accommodations, marketing, pay for coaches and support for youth programs have all been accused of being unequal between the men's and women's teams.
In the courts, the team filed a wage discrimination lawsuit in 2016, but has since withdrawn that and instead filed a gender discrimination suit accusing U.S. Soccer of "institutionalized" discrimination.
Fresh off their World Cup win, the players have also been supported by brands including Visa and Luna Bar in seeking equality, according to the New York Times.

Trump's 'go back' tweets leave no room for doubt; OP-ED

Texto completo: As he has so many times since bursting onto the presidential stage in 2015, Donald Trump played the race card on Sunday. He launched nearly three dozen broadsides on Twitter throughout the day, but a trio of his tweets stood out because they demonstrated how casually he likes to uncork his venom and how unwilling the Republican Party is to contain him.
Trump was targeting four new Democratic congresswomen of color (nicknamed "The Squad") who have become ubiquitous advocates for progressive policies and occasional thorns in House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's side: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan.
Omar is from Somalia. The other three were born in the U.S. Pressley is black and was born in Ohio. Ocasio-Cortez was born in New York and is of Puerto Rican descent. Tlaib was born in Michigan and her parents were Palestinian immigrants.
So Trump's tweets could have been translated as: "If you're a black woman born in the U.S. and a member of Congress, I think you belong in Africa."
Or, perhaps: "If you're a woman of Hispanic descent born in the U.S. and a member of Congress, I think you belong in Puerto Rico - and I still seem to think that's another country."
If there was ever any doubt that the president is a racist and a bigot and is willing to pander to racists and bigots to continue holding office, the tweets he aimed at "The Squad" on Sunday should put all of that to rest.
But, of course, it's unlikely to put anything to rest.
After all, the hosts at Fox and Friends contributed on Sunday by just having a few laughs about the president's tweets. Meanwhile, Matt Wolking, the self-described "Deputy Director of Communications - Rapid Response" for the president's 2020 campaign, did his part by responding so rapidly to the widespread criticism that he simply pretended the media misrepresented what Trump tweeted.
Some principled conservatives were willing to step up. George Conway, the husband of a prominent Trump adviser, Kellyanne Conway, tweeted that Trump's comments were "bigotry, pure and simple." And, he added, addressing Trump directly: "You are a disgrace to the office you hold, and you are a disgrace to the nation." David French, a conservative columnist with the National Review, tweeted that he "could think of few worse things for the soul of the GOP or the health and unity of our republic than adopting a strategy of 'be racist to own the libs.'"
French's observation that Trump may have been trolling the Squad to score political gains by keeping the group at odds with Pelosi probably gives the president more strategic heft than he merits. He isn't playing three-dimensional chess most of the time, and he's profoundly a guy from Queens who never liked the idea that his world was changing.
The president also is shamelessly hypocritical. His rants about the migrant threat at the U.S.'s southern border and his call for the Squad to self-deport glide past the fact that his mother was a Scottish immigrant and his father was the son of a German immigrant. Trump's first and third wives were immigrants from Eastern Europe, and his wife Melania's parents became U.S. citizens last year by taking advantage of a chain migration program that the president and his principal immigration adviser, Stephen Miller, have publicly derided.
All of this follows a week in which Trump promised to launch a federal sweep nationwide to round up undocumented immigrants so he could deport them. It also comes on the heels of Tennessee declaring a state holiday to celebrate Nathan Bedford Forrest, a former Confederate general and slave trader who was an early leader of the Ku Klux Klan.
This past week - and Trump's tweets on Sunday - are reminders that the president has chosen to divide and exploit rather than lead. A useful lesson to draw from that is that Trump and his most dedicated supporters have ripped the band-aid off whatever reassuring notions the U.S. might have had about the progress of civil rights and the withering of racism in the country. And it ultimately will be up to voters to decide what to do about the racism and vitriol that Trump has put in front of them.

Gorsuch says ‘deference doctrine' is ‘zombified'

Texto completo: When Neil Gorsuch was running for the Supreme Court, he made the usual rounds of Federalist Society conferences, seeking to capitalize on the name his mother made for herself by rolling back environmental regulations as President Reagan's EPA chief.
Name identification gave Neil a head start in the race, but he cannily used his position on the federal Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals to promote his candidacy. He took the unusual step of concurring in one of his own majority opinions in order to announce how he would rule, should he be promoted to the Supreme Court. If you do a web search for “Gorsuch” and “elephant in the room,” you'll see how successful his self-promotion was. It got him noticed in outlets from the New York Times to the National Review.
His big idea was that judges should give themselves a veto over decisions of administrative agencies. A proper understanding of separation of powers, he explained, means concentrating power in the judiciary.
Now that he's on the Supreme Court, he's beginning to make good on his campaign promises. An opportunity arose recently with a case involving James Kisor, a Marine who survived Operation Harvest Moon, a 1965 search and destroy mission in Vietnam. In 1982, Kisor applied for disability benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs but was turned down with a finding that he did not suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder. Twenty-four years later he reapplied. This time the VA acknowledged his longstanding PTSD. The question became whether he should receive benefits from 1982 or only from the date of his re-application in 2006.
The VA has a regulation governing the retroactive grant of benefits following an erroneous initial denial. The critical question is whether, in its initial determination, the agency overlooked “relevant official service records.” If so, the applicant is entitled to retroactive benefits. But the word “relevant” means little in isolation. Relevant to what? Kisor submitted additional records relevant to his participation in Operation Harvest Moon. But the VA said only documents relevant to the diagnosis of PTSD counted, and Kisor couldn't offer any of those. Accordingly, the VA denied retroactive benefits.
Kisor appealed the denial to the federal courts, all of which framed the legal issue as a question of the level of “deference” judges owe to an agency's interpretation of its own regulation, providing an excellent example of the way choice of words can govern thought rather than the other way around. The issue arises only when a regulation is truly ambiguous, so that the ordinary tools of legal interpretation provide no clear answer. When that happens, the choice between alternative interpretations boils down to a question of policy. The real legal question is whether judges have the power to substitute their policy choice for that of the agency. Judges' use of the word “deference” assumes the answer to that question, which is fundamentally dishonest.
Justice Elena Kagan, writing for a 5-4 majority, said that policy decisions should be made by the agency, since that's why Congress created the agency in the first place. In one respect, it's a tiny point, affecting only a handful of cases. But it's an issue that can arise only when a judge's political ideology clashes with the agency's policy goals, and that clash is what interests Gorsuch.
Writing a separate opinion, Gorsuch would have given judges the green light to implement their policy choices, but only when they strike down regulations, advancing his (and his mother's) deregulatory agenda. He failed to command a majority this time, but we can be sure he'll keep trying.
Gorsuch is like the late Justice Antonin Scalia in his understanding that the concept of a “living Constitution” is every bit as useful to conservatives as to liberals. Power is power. But the similarities between the two end there. Scalia was a forceful and witty writer, while Gorsuch is cutesy and affected. Gorsuch seems incapable of saying anything in a straightforward way. A hallmark of his style is the abrupt transition from the tediously pedantic to the breezily vernacular, but he never seems to get the vernacular right. In the Kisor case, he describes the “deference” doctrine as “on life support.” In the very next sentence, he says it is “in truth, zombified.” That “in truth” is priceless, but really, someone ought to tell the justice that zombies aren't ICU patients. It's not “The Night of the Living Critically Ill.”
As for James Kisor, the court failed to resolve his case. Fifty-three and a half years after the last shot in Operation Harvest Moon was fired, his case was sent back to the lower court for another round of briefing.

Texto completo: EL PASO, Texas — Assuming everything that the Border Patrol told a group of journalists here on Thursday is true, and that everything we saw in the migrant detention facilities is how they typically operate, here is the good news: Democrats can rest assured that every illegal immigrant child crossing in to the United States, either with a parent or not, is well fed, clothed, and cared for, courtesy of the American taxpayer.
Here’s the rest of the news: Democrats can also rest assured that they have effectively won the immigration fight.
President Trump had said he wanted to allow press in to some of the Border Patrol detention centers in Texas so I and several other reporters last week toured two separate facilities: one in El Paso that holds families, and the other in Clint, which holds unaccompanied minors.
The El Paso facility was like an air-conditioned warehouse, supplemented with air-conditioned tents, where families are processed and then wait for their next destination. That's usually whatever American city they were trying to reach, as they’re turned loose with a notice to appear in court one or two years later.
The Clint facility, which was described recently by the New York Times as “the stuff of nightmares,” was more or less the same. There was one main room that had several other rooms within it, where unaccompanied minors are separated by age and sex.
I thought I was there to see a war zone, mentally preparing myself for the overwhelming stench of crowded rooms where dozens of people are sharing one toilet, but that’s not what it was. The rooms were mostly empty. The El Paso facility had what appeared to be about 30 migrants. The Clint one had less than 20 minors. And it was pristine in its cleanliness, stocked with food, water, and games for everyone. I was expecting Vietnam. What I saw was the Venetian.
Trump and the heads of the departments of Defense, Health and Human Services and Homeland Security have all been saying for months that the sheer volume of illegal immigrants flowing in to the country is crushing whatever system we had in place to begin with, and that there simply weren’t enough resources to manage the tide.
Acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan, who was present for the tour, credited the slowdown in the migration to the Mexican government’s efforts to halt Central Americans passing through on their way to the U.S. And deputy chief patrol agents Clayton Thomas and Chris Clem said the reduction in volume is now allowing for quicker processing of illegal immigrants.
But when I asked McAleenan about recent reports that Mexican officials were taking bribes to let Central Americans continue their journey to the U.S., he said that was “a great question for Mexico.” When I asked him how Homeland Security efforts in Guatemala were going in attempting to slow down Hondurans and Salvadorans making the same journey from further south, he said they were going well but had no data on their efficacy. He only said that he had a “sense” that operations were working.
And agents were proud to say that they had developed smoother systems for processing the endless stream of migrants coming in to the U.S. by outsourcing meal preparation and laundering to contractors, thus freeing up more hands for more and more administrative work.
This is all another way of saying we still don’t have control over the border, and that for all we know, the number of migrants crossing in to the country is set to spike again once the blazing desert heat cools down and makes the journey for them safer. This is all another way of saying we’ve made the welcoming process for everyone south of Texas a lot nicer.
The purpose of the tours was to convince the news media that border patrol is working hard to care for every single sick and impoverished migrant showing up at the border, providing the cleanest facilities possible and three meals per day, with snacks in between. Mission accomplished.
But what about the actual policy that Trump campaigned on, the one about stopping illegal immigration altogether? What about changing the backward system we currently abide by so that we would no longer be, as Trump said in his beloved 2015 campaign launch at Trump Tower, “a dumping ground for everybody else’s problems”?
As fire-breathing as Trump can be toward the media when he’s safely holed up somewhere tweeting or behind a podium, he cringes under official scrutiny. And that’s what this media tour of the detention facilities was — a submission to Democrats, who have won the immigration fight.Story URLPhoto Caption:Decorations cover the walls the the rooms of immigrants at the U.S. government's government's newest holding center for migrant children in Carrizo Springs, Texas, Tuesday, July 9, 2019.

ICE raids delayed; many are still wary

Texto completo: Parks and other gathering areas in the immigrant enclaves of East Boston were desolate Sunday, Patricia Montes observed, as many braced for federal immigration raids that were largely delayed after news reports tipped off immigrant communities about what to expect.
“We hope nothing is going to happen," said Montes, executive director of the immigrant rights group Centro Presente. “We know some members are at home because of the raids and are even afraid to go to church."
ICE had announced that it would target 2,000 undocumented immigrants in 10 major cities: Atlanta, Baltimore, Chicago, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, New Orleans, New York, and San Francisco.
The plan to fan out in unison across immigrant communities Sunday morning was changed at the last minute because of widespread publicity, according to several current and former Department of Homeland Security officials.
Montes said the raids help keep President Trump's supporters angry about immigration and that discussing racially charged topics is better for the president's political strategy than talking about the economy or infrastructure issues.
Although Boston was left off the list of cities, and only a handful of arrests appeared to happen Sunday, many immigrants nationwide and in Boston remained on edge.
Montes said an undocumented East Boston mother of three was so scared of the announced raids that she almost didn't go out to buy medicine for her sick 1-year-old child. The woman already has a deportation notice, and one of her children recently was temporarily held in a detention center, Montes said.
Diego Low, director of the Metrowest Worker Center, said he received many calls over the three days leading up to Sunday and was asked about what the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity meant and how they should deal with the ramped-up campaign.
“People interpreting what I describe as the usual level of ICE activity as part of the raids is . . . a reflection of the fact that there was a public announcement of the raids," Low said.
“[Immigration arrests are] a regular drip, drip, drip, so if they're doing exactly what they say they're doing, I wonder how much of a spike in detentions 2,000 actually is," he added. “Not that I want them to — not that I'm challenging to spike it — but I just think maybe the point is something else."
Low added that even arrests last Tuesday were interpreted as part of the raids, although deportations have been a regular occurrence for years.
What is different this time is that the most recently announced raids are targeting children as well as parents, while previous raids targeted undocumented adults. Even so, in most such ICE operations in the past, only 20 percent to 30 percent of the targets were apprehended.
“During Obama, the overwhelming majority of enforcement actions targeted criminal aliens," said John Cohen, former acting undersecretary at the Department of Homeland Security during the Obama administration. “This operation apparently specifically targets families who for the most part present no risk."
Cohen said the raids were impractical and not likely to improve the situation at the border — where holding facilities have been overrun recently, and as a result, migrants have been living in substandard and sometimes unhealthy conditions.

Texto completo: BEIRUT, Lebanon -- Bethany Vierra didn't think she was asking for much.
First, she wanted a divorce from a husband whom she described as abusive. Then she wanted to secure custody of her 4-year-old daughter, Zeina. Then she wanted a court order to receive child support from her ex-husband, a businessman.
But as an American woman living in Saudi Arabia, Ms. Vierra has navigated a punishing legal maze ever since she first asked her Saudi ex-husband for a divorce in 2017, then opened custody proceedings last November.
Though she succeeded with the divorce, her custody battle appeared to dead end on Sunday, when a Saudi judge awarded custody of Zeina to her father's mother, who lives with him, despite video evidence Ms. Vierra submitted to the court that she said showed her ex-husband doing drugs and verbally abusing her in front of their daughter.
"It's like 10,000 times worse here because so much is at risk for women when they go to court," Ms. Vierra said, near tears, in an interview on Sunday. "I genuinely thought that there would still be justice served here, and I kind of put everything on that."
Under Saudi law, which is based on Islamic law or Shariah, mothers generally retain day-to-day custody of sons until they turn 9, and daughters until they turn 7, while fathers remain their legal guardians. The kingdom announced last year that Saudi mothers could keep custody of children after a divorce without having to file a lawsuit, as they had previously had to do, unless the father was contesting custody.
But Saudi courts prioritize ensuring that children are raised in accordance with Islam. According to court documents, the judge accepted Ms. Vierra's ex-husband's arguments that she was unfit to raise Zeina because she was a Westerner, and furthermore, because she ran her own business, a yoga studio, leaving her with little time to devote to her child.
"Since the mother is new to Islam and a foreigner in this country and embraces customs and traditions in the way she was raised," the judge wrote in his ruling, "we must avoid exposing Zeina to these traditions."
The status of women in the deeply conservative, male-dominated kingdom is in flux. New reforms put in place by the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, have allowed women to drive and curbed the power of religious enforcers who police how women dress and act in public.
The crown prince, in an interview with "60 Minutes" last year, was asked if women and men were equal and responded: "Absolutely. We are all human beings and there is no difference."
But the changes have not touched the most fundamental restriction on Saudi women, the guardianship system that gives men control over many critical parts of the lives of female relatives and wives, requiring them to get a male guardian's permission to travel, obtain a passport or undergo certain medical procedures.
A Saudi newspaper reported last week that the government was considering allowing women over age 18 to travel without a guardian's permission. That would be a major adjustment to the system, which has drawn international condemnation amid a string of high-profile cases in which young Saudi women have run away to other countries against their families' will.
The guardianship system's rules extend to women who marry Saudis, like Ms. Vierra, and their children, including dual citizens like Zeina. Even after they divorced last year, Ms. Vierra's ex-husband, whom she married in 2013, remains her guardian and Zeina's.
Wielding his guardianship powers, he prevented her from going home to see her family at Christmas and let her legal residency expire, which left her stuck, unable to access her bank account or leave the country.
Ms. Vierra spoke to The New York Times on the condition that her ex-husband not be named because she feared provoking him further. He did not respond to efforts to contact him for comment on Sunday.
The Saudi authorities granted Ms. Vierra residency in March after The Times wrote about her situation. At that point, she and her ex-husband had agreed that Zeina would live with her, with weekly visitations for him. But matters soon deteriorated, and her ex-husband began pursuing full custody in court.
He told the court that Ms. Vierra, who is from Washington State but moved to the kingdom in 2011 to teach at a women's university, did not speak Arabic well.
He also submitted photos of her in a bikini, in yoga pants and with her hair uncovered -- evidence of suspect or forbidden dress in a country that requires women to wear loose abayas in public.
Ms. Vierra said the photos were taken in the United States and were from her private social media accounts.
The court accepted his testimony at face value, she said, while hers was legally worthless unless she could bring in male witnesses to back her up. She tried to counter with videos of him that she said showed him rolling a joint to smoke hashish, talking on the phone about his marijuana use and screaming at Ms. Vierra, all with Zeina in the room.
Though he acknowledged his drug use, he accused her in court of giving him the drugs and of forcing him to say he was an atheist, both of which Ms. Vierra denies.
"It's videos versus male witnesses," Ms. Vierra said. "They wouldn't in some cases even look at the evidence that I had. It was just completely disregarded because he 'swore to God.' It's all been infuriating."
In the end, the judge found both parents unfit to raise Zeina, awarding custody instead to Ms. Vierra's former mother-in-law. But Ms. Vierra did not find this substitution comforting; she said her ex-husband's sister had testified that their mother had hit them and emotionally abused them as children.
Ms. Vierra said Zeina was frightened and confused by the decision, which she had promised her daughter she would fight, but in truth had no idea how to undo.
She had committed to a life in Saudi Arabia so that she could be with her daughter and Zeina could know her Saudi relatives, she said, and had also been proud to obtain a license to open her yoga studio, the first of its kind in the country.
Now, she said, she felt everything she had done in good faith was being used against her.
"This is not just my story -- there's much worse," she said, describing women she said she had met who had gone through similarly grueling custody battles in Saudi Arabia. "It's hard to believe stuff like this can happen."

Facebook Cryptocurrency, Won't You Be My Friend?

Texto completo: Jack Ma, a co-founder of Alibaba, was recently asked about the secret of his success. "I know nothing about technology," he said. "I know nothing about marketing." He said what he knows about is people. A successful business, he said, is all about making people happy.
Bingo! Mr. Ma is a certified business genius, a billionaire, many times over. This inspired me. I know nothing about everything! I can't lose.
I've decided to make people happy with Zuckbucks or, if you want to be formal about it, Libra.
That is the new financial system announced by Facebook and its founder, Mark Zuckerberg, with huge fanfare last month. It provides a way to transfer money, the company says, without having to deal with today's system of central banks and financial giants.
As with all new ideas in business, it makes me wonder whether it can make me obscenely rich, or at least a little indecently rich. I've had many ideas, yet I'm still driving an ailing 11-year-old car and not even buying avocado toast. So here's hoping.
I'm betting on Facebook, in my usual perverse way. The company is doing great. It says that it has already signed up more than two dozen partners, including Mastercard and Uber.
Yet strangely, not everyone shared my joy about this new venture.
"Can't wait for a cryptocurrency with the ethics of Uber, the censorship resistance of PayPal, and the centralization of Visa, all tied together under the proven privacy of Facebook," wrote Sarah Jamie Lewis, executive director of the Open Privacy Research Society. I know sarcasm when I see it. She wasn't happy!
Some of the companies that signed on as Facebook partners seem a tad unenthusiastic, as well, my colleague Nathaniel Popper has reported.
On top of that, Steven M. Bellovin, an expert in computer security at Columbia University, said the venture would bring a whole new meaning to the federal bank regulations called "know your customer": "Understanding 'know your customer' to mean 'know everything possible about your customer."'
Well, sure. Facebook knows an incredible amount about each of its users. What's wrong with that?
Facebook is a friend who understands everything about me without having to ask. It knows my politics (anarcho-moderate), my favorite ice cream (Blue Bell Natural Vanilla Bean, when I can get it, with a drizzle of molasses), and my taste in music (The Austin Lounge Lizards and Jonathan Coulton, of course, like everybody. Right?).
How could anyone be unhappy with Facebook in any way? Or with cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin has been so great, we need more of them.
My first idea was to do with Libra what the Winklevoss twins did with other cryptocurrencies: Speculate! You might remember that the Winklevii, as they are sometimes called, were in on the founding of Facebook but got pushed out before the big money rushed in. They got a hefty settlement and put some of it into cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Unlike so many starry-eyed investors, they struck it superrich.
I wrote to them asking if they'd like to try again. Facebook made them rich in cryptocurrency, so why not become even richer through Facebook's own cryptocurrency? As the Double Mint Twins used to say, more or less: Double your pleasure, double your funds.
But they haven't written back yet. Whatever happened to manners?
Thinking big didn't get me where I wanted to be, so I decided to go even brillianter, combining what I know about Facebook with what I know about cryptocurrency. Bingo! This new system could help me run for president.
After all, what's one more member in this clown car of a primary season, especially one like me, a man shorter even than James Madison, a candidate who could make Marianne Williamson seem insightful and self aware?
Here's my plan:
1) Get Cambridge Analytica or a company just like it to target people for political disinformation and build up my candidacy. It's happened before, using Facebook data.
2) Harness cryptocurrency to buy votes. Candidates are always soliciting money on Facebook. Let's reverse the process. We'll send you cryptocurrency if you'll vote for me!
Don't you dare call it a bribe. That's such an ugly word. Again: manners.
I called Siva Vaidhyanathan, an expert on Facebook and its effects on society, so that he could congratulate me on my genius idea.
Stunningly, he did not.
Mr. Vaidhyanathan's problem is he knows things. He is the director of the Center for Media and Citizenship at the University of Virginia and the author of "Anti-Social Media: How Facebook Disconnects Us and Undermines Democracy." Mr. Vaidhyanathan said that just as Libra was designed to be resistant to speculation, it was built to discourage the nefarious activities, like buying drugs and votes, that l really need.
Bitcoin is still a better bet for the skulduggery I had in mind, he suggested. "You could totally do it with Bitcoin," he said.
Besides, he added, Facebook has promised that the subsidiary handling Libra will not share sensitive personal financial data with the rest of the company.
In fact, Kevin Weil, an executive at Calibra, the Libra subsidiary, told my colleagues Mike Isaac and Nathaniel Popper that "Your financial data will never be used to target ads on Facebook." Which might even be true!
Bummer.
The biggest effect of the new network, Mr. Vaidhyanathan said, would be among people in the developing world who might not have bank accounts or credit cards but still need to transfer funds. Facebook could become a new version of Western Union, he said.
"That's an incredible amount of power Facebook could hope to have over their financial lives," he said. A vast moneymaking machine taking its cut from the $ 400 billion a year that flows from the northern hemisphere to the south each year, including enormous markets in South Asia and Africa, could be in Facebook's future. The size of the network, he said, made Facebook one of the few companies in the world that could even think of pulling this off.
Double bummer! Bummervii!
None of this is going to repair my old car, or even put me in avocado toast. It won't even make me president.
I've got one more idea: Make a new cryptocurrency of my own.
Are you ready for Schwartzbucks? Or should it be Schwartzshekels? I'll get to that bridge when I burn it. For now, I've got to figure out what blockchain is. Or forge ahead without knowing what I'm doing, right Mr. Ma?

Texto completo: Some random dispatches from the Word Front . . .
 Off With Their "Aheads"! - When did "ahead of" start to replace "before"? A recent New York Times headline proclaimed "Xi Jinping Will Make First Visit to North Korea Ahead of Meeting With Trump," while NPR noted that "The Philippines' Duterte remains popular ahead of midterm elections," and a Washington Post weather report called for "some peeks of sun today ahead of rainier conditions Sunday."
Why are writers using two words to replace one? Perhaps they're trying to suggest the notion of getting "ahead of" a potential problem before it occurs. I keep waiting for this headline: "Workers protest ahead of lettuce boycott."
 Find Your Trendy - A headline on a package of Lean Cuisine Swedish meatballs frozen dinner reads: "Feed Your Phenomenal." While I once owned a gerbil and sometimes feed a cardinal, I've never kept a phenomenal as a pet. Even so, I appreciated Lean Cuisine's reminder to feed your phenomenal when the critter gets hungry.
True, we've grown accustomed to the "find your" trope when the object is a noun; think of Starbuck's "Find Your Frappuccino," Nike's "Find Your Greatness," or Corona beer's "Find Your Beach." But what's with finding (or feeding) adjectives?
Fleet Feet Sports ads challenge you to "Find Your Strong," a fitness/dance studio is named "Find Your Fierce," eBay Fashion's slogan is "Find Your Perfect," and a recent book of daily mantras is titled "Find Your Happy." I wonder whether one of its entries is "I will seek my inner adjective."
 Side-by-Sidesplitting - I've always enjoyed the clever juxtapositions of similar-sounding, but totally different items. I was delighted the other day when a friend confessed his ignorance of the current Democratic presidential candidates by remarking: "I don't know Buttigieg from Beetlejuice."
Likewise, New York Times writer Alex Williams recently described hip millennials who toy with temperance as having "attitudes toward the hooch somewhere between Carrie Nation's and Carrie Bradshaw's." CBS Newsman Charles Kuralt once commented that "Joe McCarthy didn't know Karl Marx from Groucho [Marx]."
During the 1964 U.S. Senate race in New York, the incumbent Kenneth Keating mocked his opponent, Robert Kennedy, for being a carpetbagger who knew nothing about the state. "Bobby thinks the Gowanus Canal is part of the lower intestinal tract," he said. "He thinks Tarrytown is a new brand of cigarette."
But Bobby had the last laugh; he won.

Hate crimes, immigration raids prompt anxiety among Salt Lake County’s immigrant communities

Texto completo: SALT LAKE CITY — Recent hate crimes and upcoming immigration raids have prompted anxiety among Salt Lake County’s Hispanic and immigrant communities.
In response to rising concerns, Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill held a meeting with Utah’s Hispanic Chamber of Commerce on Thursday evening. During the discussion, Gill addressed several topics, from hate crimes to immigration raids.
Concerns over hate crimes arose due to a hate crime against Luis Lopez and his father in a tire shop last December, according to Gill. In response to that incident, the Salt Lake County District Attorney's Office pushed to pass hate crime statutes correcting past weakness in the law.
“Looking back over the past 20-25 years, there has not been a successful hate crime prosecution in the state of Utah at the local level because we did not have a hate crime statute,” Gill told KSL.com. “All hate crime prosecutions that ever happened in the state of Utah were the result of federal prosecution, not by state attorneys.”
The old law made it very hard to convict for hate crimes at all, according to Gill. Additionally, it only allowed for the conviction of misdemeanors and nothing more serious.
“The new statute gives us a workable tool, under which we don’t have to meet the same unenforceable burden that the old statute had,” Gill said. “It allows us to enhance both the misdemeanor offenses and apply a sentencing structure to enforce conduct.”
Thursday’s meeting was primarily intended to help educate the public about the new hate crime statute and what its implications are, according to Gill. Nonetheless, it took a turn when impending immigration raids came into discussion.
Nationwide raids to arrest undocumented immigrants by Immigration and Customs Enforcement are scheduled to begin on Sunday, according to the New York Times. Some “collateral” deportations may occur, and in these deportations, some immigrants on scene may be detained even if they are not the raid’s targets.
Family members who are taken into custody together will be held in Texas and Pennsylvania at detention centers, according to the New York Times. ICE’s goal is to deport them as quickly as possible.
The operation will occur in 10 major cities and at least 2,000 immigrants have been ordered deported, the New York Times said. Though Salt Lake City is not expected to be included in this weekend’s raids, immigrant communities in the area are rattled, Gill said.
“There was a genuine, palpable concern about immigration,” Gill said about Thursday’s meeting. He added, “At least the sense that I got was (that) there is genuine fear and concern that there is going to be this blanket rounding up indiscriminately and they are concerned about the due process of law. They are (concerned they are) just going to be gathered up in some unjust and inhumane way. Those are genuine fears for our community.”
The Trump administration’s goal is to show force through the operation in an attempt to deter more families from entering the United States through the southwestern border, according to the New York Times. President Donald Trump said in a tweet that he believes the operation will result in a quick end to the border crisis.
Vice President Mike Pence added in a tweet that he has seen U.S. Customs and Border Protection providing “humane and compassionate care” to immigrants. Still, the Utah immigrant community is fearful of what could happen, according to Gill.
“People are not sure whether their family might be separated or whether people might be affected by the detentions,” Luis Garza, executive director of Comunidades Unidas, told KSL TV. “It is possible for us to build bridges instead of building walls.”
Garza acknowledged that the list does not appear to include any cities in Utah, but told KSL TV that “there’s always a concern in terms of the current operations or expansion of operations of ICE here in Utah.”
Gill hopes that their work to prevent and punish hate crimes will help to build those bridges in the Hispanic community, according to KSL TV.
“It’s great that we were able to pass this legislation,” Gill concluded. “But in the broader issue of immigration, I think we as a nation and as a community can do better. Our institutional failures should not be a justification to institute fear in marginalized communities which are simply here to fill an economic gap we have created.”

Texto completo: Grabbing a copy of the newspaper at your favorite coffee shop is a thing of the past, at least it is if you frequent Starbucks.
The coffee chain will quit selling USA TODAY as well as The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal in more than 8,600 U. S. stores in September. Starbucks has sold The Times since 2000 and other papers since 2010. The New York Post first reported Starbucks' decision to drop newspapers.
The decision was due to the decline of in-store sales of newspapers.
"We are always looking at what we offer our customers in our stores and making adjustments to our portfolio based on changing customer behavior," said Starbucks spokesperson Sanja Gould. As part of our continuous efforts to enhance the overall experience in our stores for both partners and customers, we are removing select fixtures from our retail lobby in September. "
These fixtures include shelves with whole bean coffee and snacks, although these items will be available elsewhere in the store.
Newspapers won't necessarily be out at all Starbucks locations. Licensed locations in hospitals, universities and other institutions might continue to sell newspapers since they are not operated by the coffee chain itself.
The company has looked to simplify and reduce the number of products include in the store, including tumblers and specialty drinks, based on what customers are buying.
Color of Summer:Starbucks to serve groovy new 'Tie Dye Frappuccino,' only for a limited time
Alligator pear despair? Avocado prices are skyrocketing, but it's not because of tariffs
Though java and journalism have been a classic pairing for generations, indeed, the smells and smears of newsprint are in decline. While some papers are adding digital subscribers, newspaper weekday circulation has declined by more than half since its peak in the mid-'80s.
The Times says it is "disappointed" and the Journal confirmed that Starbucks is stopping print sales. No one was immediately available to comment from Gannett.
This isn't the first time Starbucks has decided old media is too passe for its cafes. It dropped the sale of CDs – remember those? – back in 2015. .

20 years after John F. Kennedy Jr.'s death, an explorer remembers

Texto completo: As renowned underwater explorer Barry Clifford suits up for his 37th year of diving on the site of the famed pirate shipwreck Whydah off Cape Cod, it's another anniversary that weighs heavily on his mind.

"I lost my friend and first mate John Kennedy Jr. 20 years ago," Clifford tells me. "Yet, I feel his presence during every dive."

This month marks two full decades since JFK Jr., 38, his wife Carolyn Bessette, 33, and her sister Lauren Bessette, 34, were killed when the plane Kennedy was piloting, a single engine Piper Saratoga II, crashed off the west coast of Martha's Vineyard on July 16, 1999.

The remains of all three were found by divers five days later on July 21, 1999, after an 18 hour search of the ocean floor. Kennedy, his wife and sister-in-law were still strapped in their seats under 116 feet of water.

"The Kennedy family had asked me to lead the recovery mission to pull their bodies from the downed plane," Clifford recalls. "I just couldn't do it. I didn't want to see them that way."

Instead, Clifford remembers a happier time when he and the son of President Kennedy and Jackie Onassis embarked on a daring adventure together — to locate the Whydah Galley, a ship helmed by legendary pirate Samuel "Black Sam" Bellamy that had sunk off Wellfleet during a violent gale in 1717.

It was the equally legendary newsman Walter Cronkite who had laid down the gauntlet to Clifford and Kennedy to find the wreck, which turned out to be a tall order.

JFK Jr. served as Clifford's first mate during those hot summers in the early 1980s when each dive turned up nothing. The crew resented Kennedy at the beginning.

"John was an expert diver, but my men didn't take him seriously at first," Clifford recalls. "But John volunteered for every dirty job onboard our salvage vessel and eventually won the respect of his mates."

In 1985, Clifford, Kennedy and crew recovered the Whydah's bell, making it the first authenticated pirate ship discovery in the world. They also found a bounty of treasure.

The pair was as close on land as they were at sea. Kennedy babysat Clifford's children and taught Clifford's son Brandon how to dive. When Jackie Onassis died in 1994, her son asked Clifford to accompany him to her mansion on Martha's Vineyard because he didn't want to be alone.

And Kennedy had been there for Clifford. He spent many nights onboard their salvage vessel guarding the dive site from prospective pirates of the modern age. Occasionally, he'd swim ashore to go dancing at the popular outer Cape nightspot The Beachcomber.

"John wore a hat and glasses so that no one would know who he was," Clifford says, laughing. "And he'd dance all night long."

But all wasn't fun and games for Kennedy on the Whydah expedition. He was nearly killed during one harrowing dive when an underwater sand pit collapsed while he was searching for a massive pile of the pirate ship's cannons.

"John saw the cannons and then the pit caved in on him," Clifford explains. "He managed to climb his way out but his compass got snagged on the cannon pile and he lost it."

Recently, Barry Clifford found an old shoe box full of photos of Kennedy and other members of the Whydah crew. The young presidential scion looked handsome and youthful and full of life.

"John made me promise that I'd never sell any piece of the Whydah collection as gold and silver coins found in the wreck had been used as currency in the slave trade before Bellamy seized the ship for his own," Clifford says. "It was important to him and it's important to us. I'm proud to say that we've kept that promise for nearly 40 years."

Casey Sherman is a volunteer investigator for the Whydah Expedition Team. He's also a New York Times bestselling author of 10 books including "Above & Beyond: John F. Kennedy and America's Most Dangerous Cold War."

Texto completo: The month of July often provides an opportunity for a good road trip or two, and these audiobooks will keep you company. Take time to discover the South, savor good food, learn about odd histories, and absorb a meditation on clean, abundant water.
Spying on the South: An Odyssey Across the American Divide, by Tony Horwitz
Read by Mark Deakins, with prologue read by the author; Penguin Audio; 17 hours; 14 CDs
When we think of Frederick Law Olmsted we generally think of New York’s Central Park or the numerous other landscapes he created. The late author Tony Horwitz retraces the footsteps of the young Olmsted, who in the 1850s wandered across the South, writing dispatches for The New York Times. Horwitz delves into not only Olmsted, but also the America he finds along the route, and both subjects are covered with humor, insight, and vivid descriptions. Mark Deakins reads with ease and includes hints of regional accents. He delivers the dialogue in a lively and fast-paced manner with perfect diction. Grade: A
Downriver: Into the Future of Water in the West by Heather Hansman
Read by Allison Ryan; HighBridge Audio; seven hours and 30 minutes; seven CDs
Part travelogue, part journalistic exposé, part introspective musings, this trip down the Green River through Wyoming, Utah, and Colorado explores water rights and where, exactly, that water goes. Heather Hansman made much of this trip as a solo voyager, and she describes the people she meets and the industries affected by the water on which she travels. The result is an intriguing mix of facts, personal insights, and lively discussions. Allison Ryan, with her moderately deep voice and clear understanding of the material, reads with authority and brings to the story the same sense of humanity that Hansman reveals with her writing. Grade: B+
Gumbo Life: Tales from the Roux Bayou by Ken Wells
Read by P.J. Ochlan; HighBridge Audio; eight hours; seven CDs
One would think a book about a spicy stew would have its limited attractions, but this is a surprisingly compelling audiobook. Journalist Ken Wells talks about gumbo from a social, historical, cultural, and personal perspective and he is never dull. You will hear of intriguing characters and interesting recipes, such as a foie gras-infused gumbo. There is a glossary of regional foods and a helpful guide to South Louisiana’s Gumbo Belt. P.J. Ochlan reads at a quick clip and easily manages regional pronunciations. The result is a mouth watering, quirky, and concise study of an important local specialty. Grade: B+
A Florida State of Mind: An Unnatural History of our Weirdest State by James D. Wright
Read by Patrick Lawlor; Tantor Media; nine hours and 15 minutes; eight CDs
Florida is known for weird stories and oddball characters, and this apparently has always been true. Author James D. Wright writes with humor and personal knowledge of a place rife with sunshine, alligators, real estate grifters, and millionaires. He sets out to prove that Florida is never quite what is seems, and does so using facts and factoids, anecdotes, and stories within stories. It’s all fascinating, and it’s read with plenty of brio by Patrick Lawlor, a well-established narrator who knows how to punch up the audiobook’s inherent humor without overdoing it. The one misstep is a long introduction that outlines everything we are going to hear anyway. Grade: B

Texto completo: President Trump's Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency could target thousands of immigrant families across the U.S. on Sunday for deportation, after scrapping a similar plan he announced last month on Twitter.
ICE is expected to pursue at least 2,000 immigrants who have missed court appearances or been ordered removed from the U.S. The new schedule for the raids was first reported Thursday by the New York Times.
The raids are expected in 10 cities across the U.S., leading to an outcry from advocates and Trump opponents that the ultimate intent of the raids may be to instill fear in immigrant communities to deter further migration. Trump often employs the tactic of threatening, but ultimately not taking action, in order to extract concessions.

"This is not an effort to root out dangerous criminals," Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said on the Senate floor Thursday. "This is an act of brutish force designed to spread fear.... 'Make them afraid, and maybe they won't come.' "
ICE spokesman Matthew Bourke would not confirm any pending raids or offer further details, citing "law enforcement sensitivities and the safety and security of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement personnel."
"As always, ICE prioritizes the arrest and removal of unlawfully present aliens who pose a threat to national security, public safety and border security," he said in a statement Thursday. "However, all of those in violation of the immigration laws may be subject to immigration arrest, detention and -- if found removable by final order -- removal from the United States."
Department of Homeland Security and White House officials did not respond to requests for comment.
Los Angeles Police Chief Michel Moore said in an interview that the department had not been made aware of any increased enforcement.
LAPD officials have contacted community and immigration advocates across the city to reiterate that its officers are not participating in any sweeps, Moore said.
While federal officials continue to conduct routine enforcement in the city, the LAPD does not and will not participate in the enforcement of civil administrative law, Moore said.
"Our posture remains the same," Moore told The Times. "We're not involved in any fashion or form. This is separate and apart" from the Los Angeles police.
"We are committed to protecting the people of Los Angeles through community engagement, relationship building and strict adherence to the law," he added.
Los Angeles Police Commission President Steve Soboroff said any widespread ICE raids would hurt the LAPD's relationship with the Latino community.
"I'm worried about ICE impersonating the LAPD, who spend an inordinate amount of time each day trying to build trust in the community," Soboroff said. "This does nothing but scare the community. We're in the trust-building business. It's very hurtful to everybody in Los Angeles."
The on-again, off-again raids favored by the White House are also deepening fissures within his embattled Department of Homeland Security, the behemoth agency charged with domestic safety and tackling an ongoing humanitarian crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border.
In June, acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan ordered then-acting ICE Director Mark Morgan to call off a previous "family op," but Morgan appealed directly to the White House. Then Trump announced the raids on Twitter on June 17.
Officials, lawyers and advocates scrambled to prepare in Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Atlanta, Baltimore, Chicago, Denver, Houston, Miami and New Orleans, where the operation was reportedly planned.
Days later, Trump pulled back.
"At the request of Democrats, I have delayed the Illegal Immigration Removal Process (Deportation) for two weeks to see if the Democrats and Republicans can get together and work out a solution to the Asylum and Loophole problems at the Southern Border," he tweeted June 22. "If not, Deportations start!"
On July 1, Trump signed into law a $4.5-billion bill to address a surge in migration to the southwest border. Last month, apprehensions at the border decreased by about 28%, from 132,880 in May to 94,897 in June. Officials attribute the decline to increased enforcement by Mexico and summer heat, among other factors.
As of Monday, Morgan is acting chief of Customs and Border Protection, the Border Patrol's parent agency, after the previous head resigned amid a scandal over reports of unsanitary conditions for migrant children in agency custody.
Most top positions in the Homeland Security Department remain empty, fallout from a purge Trump kicked off in April when he said he wanted to go in a "tougher" direction.
Morgan did not respond to requests for comment on the ICE raids, but tensions have persisted between him and McAleenan, his boss, following the canceled operation, as administration hardliners -- and the president himself -- register complaints about the acting secretary.

Texto completo: El Paso mayor Dee Margo said the city has spent $200,000 worth of city resources providing assistance during the influx of migrant arrivals this year.
Acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan met with federal employees in El Paso and visited a Border Patrol station in nearby Clint where immigrant children have been held, sometimes hungry, sick, and without cots to sleep on.
McAleenan also met with members of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, which includes El Paso Mayor Dee Margo, to discuss immigration-related hardships facing their communities.
While in El Paso, McAleenan was scheduled to host a town hall with DHS personnel, tour other U.S. Customs and Border Protection facilities, and meet with volunteers with the DHS Surge Capacity Force — a program that allows DHS to reassign volunteers from the department and other federal agencies to help with situations identified as an emergency by the DHS secretary.
At the town hall, he spoke about interdepartmental cooperation with employees from CBP, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, and the U.S. Coast Guard, according to a DHS news release.
He was set to tour the U.S. Border Patrol's El Paso Station and receive a briefing about the El Paso Sector, which covers West Texas and all of New Mexico, and what actions the CBP, which oversees the U.S. Border Patrol, has taken to improve conditions for immigrants and adjust to the changing flow of immigrants.
During his visit to the Clint holding facility, he was expected to be briefed on the medical services and accommodations provided at the site.
A report by the El Paso Times and the New York Times this weekend detailed allegations of poor conditions in which migrant children were being held at the Border Patrol Station in Clint, as well as the concerns of current and former Border Patrol agents over the conditions.
The Border Patrol previously had given the media a tour of the facility and denied the allegations, while saying the increase in migrant numbers was taxing the system.
Protesters from as far as Washington state joined locals to show disdain of the conditions in the Clint facility.
Peggy Hinkle of El Paso said she was glad to see people form other communities speak out on the alleged conditions where migrant children were kept.
"It's heartbreaking, she said.
Amy Sommers of Seattle said she came to Clint after reading the El Paso Times/New York Times story.
"I felt like I was going to be sick to my stomach," she said.
McAleenan meets with the U.S. Conference of Mayors Members of the United States Conference of Mayors were able to see border facilities and processes for themselves before individually meeting with McAleenan.
The eight mayors, mostly from border cities, were able to see the Downtown bridge and processing facility as well as the El Paso Border Patrol Station.
Their experience was much different than that of the agents' who had been working in the facilities months ago. The facilities did not shelter many migrants, the mayors said.
What the mayors did stress to McAleenan was that more resources and support are needed on the border to help maintain steady flow for economic commerce.
They also said that they told the DHS secretary that their communities need to be reimbursed for the expenses local organizations and cities are spending on providing assistance to migrants.
El Paso mayor Dee Margo said the city has spent $200,000 worth of city resources providing assistance during the influx of migrant arrivals this year.
If the situation does not change, the city could spend up to $300,000 by the end of the year, he added.
Migrants who returned to Juarez under the Trump administration's Migrant Protection Protocols, commonly known as the Remain in Mexico policy, may soon receive job opportunities.
He mentioned that Juarez officials have expressed interest in helping migrants affected by the program forcing asylum seekers to process their case in Mexico with jobs in the manufacturing sector.
But little is known how that might work.
"Mayor (Armando) Cabada and I work very closely," he said.
Immigration raids set for Sunday In another immigration-related development, the New York Times reported that migrant raids are set for Sunday in U.S. cities, although federal officials have not disclosed which cities will be affected.
In an emailed statement Thursday, a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesperson said: "Due to law-enforcement sensitivities and the safety and security of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement personnel, the agency will not offer specific details related to enforcement operations. As always, ICE prioritizes the arrest and removal of unlawfully present aliens who pose a threat to national security, public safety and border security. In fact, 90 percent of aliens arrested by ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations component in FY2018 had either a criminal conviction(s), pending criminal charge(s), were an ICE fugitive, or illegally reentered the country after previously being removed. However, all of those in violation of the immigration laws may be subject to immigration arrest, detention and — if found removable by final order — removal from the United States."
Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke retweeted a post by the The American Immigration Lawyers Association with phone numbers migrants affected by the raids can call in different cities.
One of the cities listed is Houston, which reportedly was on one of the cities set to see raids in a previous plan that was postponed by President Donald Trump.
Rally opposing detention planned Friday A rally demanding the end to migrant detention is planned for Friday by the Coalition to End Child Detention-El Paso, Border Network for Human Rights, the ACLU of Texas, Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center and the Hope Border Institute.
Beginning at 5:30 p.m., participants will march from the Paso Del Norte international bridge in Downtown El Paso to Cleveland Square Park, where people will speak about detention camps in the United States.
At 9 p.m., participants at Cleveland Square Park and others around the country will light candles in a silent vigil for people who are being detained.
Similar events are planned for San Diego, New York City, Washington and Homestead, Florida, organizers said in a news release.

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES - Rip Torn, the free-spirited Texan who overcame his quirky name to become a distinguished actor in television, theater, and movies, such as "Men in Black, and win an Emmy in his 60s for "The Larry Sanders Show, has died. He was 88.
Torn died Tuesday afternoon at his home with his wife, Amy Wright, and daughters Katie Torn and Angelica Page by his side, according to his publicist Rick Miramontez. No cause of death was given.
His work on stage and screen spanned seven decades, ranging from an early career of dark, threatening roles to iconic comedic performances later in life.
After acclaimed performances in "Cross Creek, 'Sweet Bird of Youth and other dramas, Torn turned to comedy to capture his Emmy as the bombastic, ethically challenged television producer in "The Larry Sanders Show. Created by and starring Garry Shandling, HBO's spoof of TV talk shows aired from 1992 to 1998 and is widely credited with inspiring such satirical programs as "30 Rock and "Curb Your Enthusiasm.
Torn played Agent Zed in the first two "Men in Black, movies, which starred Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith.
Born Elmore Rual Torn, the actor adopted the name Rip in his boyhood, following the tradition of his father and uncle. It was the subject of endless ridicule during his early days as a stage actor in New York, and fellow drama students urged him to change it.
With customary stubbornness, he refused, eventually overcoming the jokes with a series of powerful performances that led to his being regarded, along with Marlon Brando, Paul Newman and James Dean, as actors of a postwar generation who brought tense realism to their craft. He was also a political activist who joined James Baldwin, Harry Belafonte and other cultural and civil rights leaders for a frank and emotional 1963 meeting with then-Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy about the country's treatment of blacks.
Other film credits included "Critics Choice and "The Cincinnati Kid. In Albert Brooks' "Defending Your Life, he was featured as a gregarious attorney in the afterlife.
Brooks tweeted Tuesday night, "R.I.P Rip Torn. He was so great in Defending Your Life. I'll miss you Rip, you were a true original.
On television he played such figures as Richard Nixon, Lyndon B. Johnson and Walt Whitman.
His career hit a dry spell in the 1970s, and he blamed it on the buzz in Hollywood at the time that he was difficult to work with, a reputation sealed when tension on the set of "Easy Rider led to his being replaced by Jack Nicholson for the 1969 release and missing out on one of the biggest hits of the era.
"I wouldn't say that I was blacklisted, he told The Associated Press in 1984, "but the word got around that I was difficult and unreliable. Unreliable! In all my years in the theater I have never missed a performance.
He managed to keep working in small projects in theater, films and TV, returning to the mainstream in 1983 with "Cross Creek, in which he played table-smashing backwoodsman Marsh Turner. The role brought him his only Oscar nomination, for best supporting actor. He also appeared in 1984's "City Heat.
But he never entirely shook his rebellious reputation.
"What do they say about all the guys that are tremendous actors? he told The New York Times in 2006. "Don't they say they have a volatile temper and emotions? Yeah, sure they do! They're not saying they like a nice, mild guy. Look at Sean Penn.
In 1994, actor-director Dennis Hopper said on "The Tonight Show With Jay Leno that Torn once pulled a knife in a New York restaurant as he complained about being replaced in "Easy Rider. He sued Hopper for slander and won a $475,000 judgment.
He remained active in film and television in later years, including a recurring role in "30 Rock and a voice acting gig in the 2007 animated "Bee Movie.
He weathered a couple of drunken driving arrests, including one in December 2008 near his home in Salisbury, Connecticut, that led to his placement in an alcohol education program.
Torn and his first wife, actress Ann Wedgeworth, had a daughter, Danae, before divorcing. In 1963 he married Page, with whom he had co

Seeing Kubrick with eyes wide open

Texto completo: In the summer of 1999, when I was 16, I wrote a letter to the editor of the New York Times. To my surprise, the Times published it.
The subject of my adolescent missive, titled "Don't Call Him Cold," was what I took to be a profound mischaracterization of Stanley Kubrick’s final film, Eyes Wide Shut.
The film, which Warner Bros. brought out four months after Kubrick’s death at 70, was not even one weekend old when the Times published a derisive essay by critic Michiko Kakutani. The maker of 2001: A Space Odyssey and A Clockwork Orange, Kakutani argued, had miscast himself as the director of Eyes Wide Shut, which was, at its core, a searing sketch of a marriage between guileless physician Bill Harford (Tom Cruise) and his somewhat more evolved wife Alice (Nicole Kidman, who, lest we forget, was then the real-life spouse of Cruise).
Yet all that potential for drama was wasted on a director not at home with emotional material, claimed Kakutani. I retorted that Eyes Wide Shut was, in fact, “a film of extraordinary power and emotion, whose final scene may rank with the most moving and stunningly played that Kubrick ever directed.”
Well, 20 years after the release of Eyes Wide Shut, I still think I was right and Kakutani was wrong. To be sure, Kubrick did his part to earn some of the adjectives — “chilly,” “sterile,” “cynical” — that are frequently tossed in his direction. Yet Eyes Wide Shut complicates our notion of Kubrick as an unfeeling pessimist. Perhaps we should credit the source material: Based on a 1926 novella by Arthur Schnitzler, whose gift for depicting “the inner lives of people” was praised by Kakutani, the film brought out Kubrick’s empathy and sincerity more than, say, Arthur C. Clarke. Here, in the last message he transmitted to moviegoers, Kubrick expressed a guarded but earnest optimism about his lead characters’ moral backbone.
Indeed, as Eyes Wide Shut opens, Bill and Alice Harford appear to be on solid footing. Bill has ascended the ranks of his profession, even winning the trust of a smooth-talking tycoon, Victor Ziegler (Sydney Pollack), while Alice contentedly tends to hearth and home. Scored incessantly to the festive yet melancholy sounds of a suite by Dmitri Shostakovich, the film revels in its domesticity: Alice goes over homework with their daughter; Bill keeps an eye on a football game on TV.
Of course, for much of its 159-minute running time, Bill and Alice are shuttled into scenes intended to tear asunder their bonds. At a party thrown at Ziegler’s mansion, Alice allows herself to be swirled around the dance floor by a Lothario, while Bill is tasked with reviving a drug-addicted prostitute in, of all places, the private bathroom of his host. Yet Kubrick shows these two holding fast to their upper-middle-class mores: Bill is clearly staggered by Ziegler’s licentiousness (if unwilling to challenge his mentor), while Alice ends her dance with the would-be pickup artist by protesting, “I’m married.”
Kubrick is no Pollyanna. Late one night, Alice is weirdly offended by Bill’s vote of confidence for her marital fidelity and tries her best to wound him. In a monologue delivered with cat-like precision by Kidman, Alice claims to have once been tempted to break her vows with a naval officer. Beckoned to attend to an expired patient’s family, Bill stays out past his bedtime. Fatefully, he encounters a woman who carries a torch for him, a sweet-natured prostitute, and various other assorted sleazebags before winding up at a masked orgy at which a murder seems to have been set in motion.
Kubrick’s camera inhales the contours of a city after dark: the shadows, the sparkling multicolored lights, the lonely passersby. Yet, to our great relief, neither Bill nor Alice actually stumble over the cliff of infidelity, or worse. In the unlikely setting of a toy store, a place overflowing with tokens of wonderment and innocence, Bill and Alice restate their affection and commit to march on with their marriage.
Perhaps Kubrick, who was married three times but was with his third and final wife, Christiane, for more than 40 years, was a believer in something after all, the gift of family and the grace of monogamy. Said his daughter Anya in an interview with Sight & Sound after his death: “He was a very nice, good, rather Jewish father — over-protective but not more so than many. He would always be there for us, and he was fantastic in a crisis.”
Frank Capra, he wasn’t. Just don’t call him cold.

Texto completo: Las redadas a nivel nacional para arrestar a miles de miembros de familias indocumentadas se han programado para comenzar el domingo, según dos oficiales de seguridad nacional actuales y uno anterior, informa The New York Times, avanzando con una operación que cambia rápidamente, cuyos detalles finales permanecen en proceso.
La operación, respaldada por el presidente Trump, se había pospuesto, en parte debido a la resistencia entre los funcionarios de su propia agencia de inmigración.
Las redadas, que se llevarán a cabo por la Agencia de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas (ICE), durante varios días, incluirán deportaciones “colaterales”, según los funcionarios, quienes hablaron con NYT bajo condición de anonimato, debido a la etapa preliminar de la operación. En esas operaciones de captura, las autoridades podrían detener a otros inmigrantes que se encuentren en la escena, a pesar de que no sean el objetivo de las redadas.
Cuando sea posible, los miembros de la familia que son arrestados juntos, serán recluidos en centros de detención familiar en Texas y Pennsylvania.
Pero debido a las limitaciones de espacio, algunos pueden quedarse en habitaciones de hotel hasta que se puedan preparar sus documentos de viaje. El objetivo de ICE es deportar a las familias lo más rápido posible.
Los funcionarios dijeron que los agentes de ICE están previendo la detención de al menos 2,000 inmigrantes a los que se les ordenó deportar, algunos por no presentarse en el tribunal, pero que permanecen en el país ilegalmente. Se espera que la operación se lleve a cabo como se había anunciado, en al menos 10 ciudades importantes.
Las familias que ICE espera detener, son de personas que cruzaron la frontera recientemente: la administración Trump aceleró sus procedimientos de inmigración el otoño pasado. En febrero, a muchos de esos inmigrantes se les notificó que se presentaran en una oficina de ICE y se fueran de Estados Unidos, dijeron las autoridades de seguridad nacional.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Vice President Mike Pence is vowing to bring cameras along on Friday when he visits a Border Patrol facility in Texas, which he described as "overwhelmed and overflowing. "
"We're going to let people see the facility – a facility that is providing care, providing hygiene, providing healthcare and support," Pence said Wednesday. "But we're also going to see a system that is overwhelmed. "
When Democratic lawmakers toured Border Patrol facilities earlier this month, they were asked to turn over their phones and any other recording devices. But Rep. Joaquin Castro, a Democrat from Texas, defied the request and later posted video he took on his phone of the crowded conditions at a center in El Paso.
The deaths of migrant children in border detention centers and reports of dangerously overcrowded conditions have sparked an outcry. The Democratic-controlled House Oversight and Reform Committee is holding a hearing on the issue on Friday, the same day that Pence will be traveling to McAllen, Texas, to tour a detention facility.
While Democrats have lambasted the administration over the treatment of migrants, Pence accused them of initially denying there was a crisis at the border and then delaying additional funding for the detention facilities facing an unprecedented flow of migrants from Central America.
"We’re going to lean into this crisis," the vice president said.

Touching testimony: Migrant mother describes toddler’s illness, death
Pence criticized lawmakers such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N. Y. , who have compared the detention facilities to concentration camps.
"It is really contemptible that some in Congress have referred to U. S. detention facilities as concentration camps,” Pence said. “That's an outrage. The Nazis killed people. Our Customs and Border Protection personnel save lives every day. "
Pence’s trip to the border comes as the New York Times reported that the Trump administration was planning to arrest thousands of undocumented immigrants in raids to begin Sunday. President Donald Trump announced plans for massive raids last month and then said he would delay the action for a couple of weeks.
The arrests could exacerbate overcrowding at detention centers at a time when lawmakers are expressing increasing alarm over the conditions.
Concentration camps?: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defends claim
An inspector general's report released last week described the conditions at detention facilities in the Rio Grande Valley as “a ticking time bomb. " And underage migrants held at the Border Patrol's holding facilities in Arizona have reported poor conditions, as well as allegations of misconduct and even sexual assault at the hands of U. S. border agents, NBC News reported Tuesday.
After visiting five facilities in June, an inspector general report described dangerous overcrowding. Pictures in the report showed migrants crowded behind chain-link fences in a McAllen, Texas, facility or huddling under blankets on the floor.
The United Nations’ human rights chief said Monday she was “appalled” by the conditions migrants and refugees face in U. S. detention facilities.
Six migrant children have died in federal detention since December, Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat, said at a Wednesday House hearing at which a migrant mother described the death of her daughter who developed a viral respiratory infection during three weeks of detention.
After Democratic members of Congress and the Texas Legislature visited a Border Patrol station in Clint, Texas, earlier this month, they called the conditions they saw inhumane.
Pence said the detention centers are overwhelmed because “our system was simply never designed to deal with this. ”
United Nations weighs in: 'This should never happen anywhere'
Report: Allegations of misconduct and sexual assault of migrant kids surface
But Pence and his aides have pushed back on some of Democrats' descriptions of the facilities, particularly the comparison to concentration camps.
"There's just been such a gross mischaracterization of what's happening," Marc Short, Pence's chief of staff, told FOX Business Network’s Mornings with Maria on Wednesday.
Short said that during his visit to the border, Pence is going to "really highlight what is happening inside" the detention centers because “the comparisons and the rhetoric is just absolutely absurd. "

Texto completo: Harvard University on Wednesday suspended the prominent economist Roland G. Fryer Jr. for two years without pay and shut down his education research laboratory after an investigation found he engaged in unwelcome sexual conduct with multiple women in the lab.
The punishment derails the career of a scholar who, at 30, became the youngest African-American to receive tenure at Harvard. Fryer was also awarded a MacArthur “genius" grant in 2011 and the John Bates Clark Medal in 2015, given by the American Economic Association to the best American economist under age 40.
Now 42, he had been among the highest-paid employees at Harvard, earning $618,027, according to the university's 2015 tax form, and his Education Innovation Laboratory, or EdLabs, had attracted funding from some of the biggest names in philanthropy, including the Broad, Pritzker, and Gates foundations.
His downfall came after multiple women alleged that Fryer discussed sex at work, sexualized female employees, and created a demeaning workplace at the lab for several years, according to an attorney representing a lab worker who filed a complaint. Fryer's suspension was announced at a time when the university, like other institutions, has been reckoning with the prevalence of sexual harassment in the #MeToo era.
In an e-mail to members of Harvard's economics department, Claudine Gay, dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, noted that a review by Harvard's Office for Dispute Resolution concluded that Fryer “engaged in unwelcome sexual conduct toward several individuals, resulting in the creation of a hostile work environment over the course of several years."
Harvard's action also took into account allegations of financial mismanagement at EdLabs.
“In short, Professor Fryer exhibited a pattern of behavior that failed to meet expectations of conduct within our community and was harmful to the well-being of its members," Gay wrote. “I was particularly upset to learn of the ways in which EdLabs members have been impacted, both personally and professionally. The totality of these behaviors is a clear violation of institutional norms and a betrayal of the trust of the FAS community."
When Fryer's two-year suspension is over, he will be barred from advising or supervisory roles, and will, at Gay's discretion, be allowed to teach undergraduate classes monitored by a Title IX-trained individual, without access to graduate teaching fellows, Gay wrote.
Fryer will also be allowed to teach graduate classes, but not graduate workshops. After Fryer completes two years working under those strictures, Gay will decide whether to restore Fryer's academic privileges, she wrote.
“I am deeply disappointed, particularly because the important and outstanding work of my colleagues in our economics research Lab has been forced to stop," Fryer said in a statement. “Harvard has spoken. In due course, I will as well."
George J. Leontire, a lawyer who has represented Fryer, released a statement saying: “Given the decision was rendered today, Professor Fryer intends to examine his options going forward."
The women who were harassed have not spoken publicly, and a lawyer for one of them did not respond to messages Wednesday.
The New York Times reported that one of the women was a former Fryer assistant who received a text message from the professor after work hours that read, “Ur lucky ur not here. I would either tackle, bite u or both."
Fryer told a Harvard investigator the message was a “same-race thing" with the assistant, who was black, according to the Times. But the woman said the comment was “not a thing that black people say to one another," the Times reported.
In a letter published in the Times in December, Fryer apologized for making “bad jokes," but denied retaliating against employees or fostering an environment where women felt alienated.
Fryer already had been barred in March 2018 from entering EdLabs, the research space devoted to closing the racial achievement gap, which he founded in 2008.
With the closure of the lab announced Wednesday, three full-time workers and one-part time employee will lose their jobs, according to a person affiliated with the lab. Harvard said they would be given a lengthy notice period and help finding other work.
Tanaya Devi, a former Fryer research assistant and fourth-year PhD student in economics at Harvard, said she was “stunned and disappointed" in the decision to suspend Fryer.
“Not only does it seem Draconian because it was based on off-color humor in the lab, but it also seems unjust that Dean Gay has decided to penalize his researchers," who will have to scrap the studies they had been conducting with Fryer, Devi said. She said she had been working on several papers with the professor that will now be canceled.
“I continue to say Professor Fryer did nothing wrong," Devi said.
Colby Bruno, senior counsel at the Victim Rights Law Center, which advocates for victims of sexual assault and harassment, argued that a suspension was not enough, and said Harvard should move to fire Fryer.
“Too many times in our society we are too lenient with people who ruin people's lives," Bruno said. “He created a hostile work environment, he sexually harassed a multitude of people, he does not deserve to be there."
As dean, Gay cannot fire Fryer. Only the Harvard Corporation, the university's board, has the authority to remove faculty for “grave misconduct or neglect of duty."
Asked why Harvard didn't terminate Fryer, Rachael Dane, a Harvard spokeswoman, said the university weighs multiple factors when deciding how to sanction professors, including fairness to the faculty member, a sense of proportionality, responsiveness to victims, and the prevention of inappropriate behavior in the future.
“The university believes that the sanctions in this case . . . appropriately take into account these factors," Dane said.
Fryer had been celebrated as a pioneering and fearless economist whose work examining the racial divide in education and other areas sometimes yielded contrarian conclusions.
In a widely noted 2016 study, he found no racial bias in police shootings, an outcome that, he told the Times, was “the most surprising result of my career."
In May, Harvard barred Jorge Dominguez, a onetime vice provost and noted Cuban scholar, from campus and off-campus events and stripped him of other privileges granted to retired faculty after a yearlong investigation found a pattern of sexual misconduct spanning four decades.
Several women had alleged that Dominguez grabbed their knees, pressed his crotch into them, and touched their buttocks when he hugged them.
In May, Harvard Law professor Ronald S. Sullivan Jr.lost his position as faculty dean of Winthrop House after a campus furor erupted over his planned defense of the accused rapist Harvey Weinstein.
Students have, over the past year, demanded an external review of how Harvard handles sexual harassment complaints, and the graduate students' union has called for stronger sexual harassment protections in its first contract negotiations with the university.
In May, Harvard president Lawrence Bacow said the university would conduct an outside review to consider what organizational characteristics or culture at Harvard discourage people from reporting misconduct and whether there are barriers to effectively dealing with allegations.

Texto completo: An oil services company said Monday it had no plans to conduct an aerial survey of part of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska this summer. As a result, there will most likely be no new information about any potential oil and gas riches in the refuge as the Trump administration moves to sell drilling leases there this year.
Environmental groups last month had objected to a reported proposal by the French-based company, CGG, to conduct the survey in July. The groups said that the work, involving low-altitude plane flights to measure gravitational changes that could point to potential oil and gas reserves underground, should require a permit from the Interior Department because of the potential impact on wildlife. The department had said no permit was necessary.
But in a phone interview Monday, Christophe Barnini, a spokesman for the company, said that there was never an actual proposal for a survey. "It was never really planned," he said. "It was just a kind of open discussion that we had within the company."
"Definitely the company is not considering that kind of work" in the refuge, Mr. Barnini said.
The Department of Interior did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday.

Adam Kolton, executive director of the Alaska Wilderness League, one of the groups that had objected to the plan for a survey, said it was "a rare case of good news" that overflights would not take place. "The Trump administration showed no interest in managing the activity to protect the refuge," he said.
The administration, undoing decades of environmental protections in the 19-million acre refuge, plans to sell drilling leases in a part of it known as the 1002 Area, which is 1.5 million acres of the coastal plain by the Beaufort Sea. The area is home to calving caribou, polar bears and other wildlife.
The United States Geological Survey has estimated that the 1002 Area could contain up to 12 billion barrels of oil, making it potentially North America's largest untapped petroleum reserve.
But there have been no studies of the underlying geology of the area since a seismic survey in the 1980s. Only one well has ever been drilled in the area, in the mid 1980s, and although the results from the well have been kept secret, a New York Times investigation found that they were disappointing.
A project for a new seismic study, to be conducted by trucks traveling across the 1002 Area in winter, has been postponed, in part because of delays in getting the necessary permits to allow some disruption to wildlife. An aerial survey would have provided some information about the subsurface conditions, although such surveys are less detailed and useful than on-the-ground seismic work.
The lack of new information about the refuge's oil and gas potential may affect the price of leases, which the Interior Department hopes to auction this year. The program to allow oil and gas leasing in the refuge was added to the 2017 Tax Act with the goal of adding $ 1 billion in federal revenue over 10 years.
Environmental groups had objected to the aerial survey in a letter to the Bureau of Land Management, a division of the Interior Department, in June. They argued that sustained noise by airplanes flying under 2,000 feet could have "deleterious effects" on wildlife, especially calving caribou.
In a letter to CGG in April, an official with the Bureau of Land Management in Alaska said the agency had "reviewed your notice of intent to conduct airborne geophysical activity" in the refuge.
Because there was no surface component to the work, the letter said, "we have determined that your activity, as proposed, does not require a geophysical permit from the Department of the Interior." But the agency recommended that the flights be postponed over any areas where caribou were present until late July, when the calving period would be over.

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES - Aquaman only thinks he's king of the sea.
That title rightly belongs to SpongeBob SquarePants, whose superpower -- an unsinkable spirit -- has kept him on the throne for most of two decades.
"He's the person you want to be with, that's always looking at things from a positive angle," said Carolyn Lawrence. She voices the character of Sandy Cheeks on the Nickelodeon series, which celebrates its 20th anniversary with a one-hour special Friday, "SpongeBob's Big Birthday Blowout" and a party Saturday at the Mall of America.
"Something terrible could be going on and SpongeBob's going to see the good side of it. That's a really fun place to be."
The show may not be as popular as it was in its heyday, when 60 million viewers were tuning in every month, but the characters are still soaking up the love. "SpongeBob SquarePants" remains the top-rated series in kids animation with a TV spinoff in the works and a third feature film slated for 2020.
New toys based on the shows popular memes are helping to boost merchandise sales past the $13 billion mark. A Broadway musical garnished 12 Tony Award nominations last year. RockBottom Plunge, a roller coaster inspired by an early episode, remains one of the most popular attractions at the MOA's Nickelodeon Universe.
Maroon 5 nearly salvaged its much-maligned Super Bowl halftime show last winter by having SpongeBob's pal Squidward Tentacles introduce one of the songs. The band may have won over the critics if they had given the clarinet-blowing octopus a solo.
"People get mad at the NFL. They don't get mad at SpongeBob," said Tom Kenny, who has voiced the title character since the beginning. "They don't hate on SpongeBob. They hate on Maroon 5."
The series, which debuted on July 17, 1999, was the brainchild of Stephen Hillenburg, a biology instructor. He noticed how children were enraptured by underwater creatures when they visited the Orange County Marine Institute. His concept, which took 10 years to develop, was instrumental in making Nickelodeon a cable powerhouse.
By the third season, "SpongeBob" was TV's most-watched children's show, a title it has yet to relinquish. Hillenburg passed away last year, but the series continues to follow his original recipe: eye-popping colors, a frantic pace and over-the-top antics.
"You get hit in the face, your face takes on the shape of a frying pan," said Rodger Bumpass, who plays Squidward. "SpongeBob starts crying, he turns into a lawn sprinkler."
Those ingredients are all on display in Friday's special, which includes a raucous party in a pineapple house and a dancing can of beans. But the cartoon is more than just a visual feast.
"I think kids look at [SpongeBob] and he has the life they want," said co-executive producer Vincent Waller. "He has a job he loves. He doesn't have parents to answer to. He lives in a house by himself. But he is still obviously a child at heart. And they just go, 'Oooh, I want that.' "
The show also connects with grown-ups.
David Bowie was a fan. Former president Barack Obama called it one of his favorite shows. At one point, roughly a third of the audience was above the age of 18. It's not just because of the references to Led Zeppelin, Edgar Allan Poe and Pablo Picasso.
"It seems to be a refreshing breath from the pre-irony era," Syracuse University pop-culture expert Robert Thompson once told the New York Times. "There's no sense of the elbow-in-the-rib, tongue-in-cheek aesthetic that so permeates the rest of American culture. ... I think what's subversive about it is it's so incredibly naive -- deliberately."
Cast to be at MOA
The "SpongeBob" cast isn't immune to their show's charms.
Bill Fagerbakke, who plays slow-witted starfish Patrick, once bought some golf balls only because the box was in the shape of SpongeBob's head. Lawrence snagged giant banners from the first movie after they were done hanging at her local mall. Bumpass claims to have the world's largest collection of SpongeBob merchandise, including dental supplies and toilet-training gear.
"I have things that no one else can have, because they are signed by the cast," he said. "I'm going to have an open house."
Bumpass may get to hide behind an animated character, but that doesn't mean it's easy for him to go shopping without fans doing a double take.
"I was recognized at my dentist's office the other day and I was like, 'How in the world do you know me?' " he said.
Fagerbakke discovered that youngsters knew his "true identity" way back in Season 2 when he was picking up his daughters from elementary school.
"I had this kind of John Lennon buzz around the playground," he said. "I was kind of stunned that the kids were so hip to it. I mean, I loved Looney Tunes, but I wasn't wondering who Mel Blanc was."
Anonymity in the Twin Cities will be even harder after a celebration Saturday at the Mall of America that includes a chance for fans to meet Kenny and Lawrence.
In Friday's birthday special, SpongeBob bubbles to the Earth's surface for a live-action interaction with cast members in a diner that has more than a passing resemblance to the Krusty Krab.
Kenny said the taping was a bit surreal, being on the set with his fellow actors dressed as their characters after two decades of working out of a sound booth.
"I don't want to tell tales out of school," Kenny said. But I think Clancy [Brown, who voices Mr. Krabs] put it perfectly when he looked around and said, 'Wow, this is like having sex with the lights on.' "
Despite the hoopla, "SpongeBob" still has a long way to go before it's the longest-running animated series in America. "The Simpsons," "Arthur" and "South Park" all debuted earlier and are still in production. Still, the ocean's highest-energy bottom dwellers hope to stick around. The network has not announced plans beyond this season, but it has greenlit a 13-episode prequel starring a 10-year-old SpongeBob during his summer at sleep-away camp.
"We want to last a little bit longer than the pyramids," Bumpass said.

Pelosi not backing down on AOC feud: 'I have no regrets about anything'

Texto completo: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is sticking by her public comments dismissing the influence of House freshman progressive star Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and a handful of others who bucked the Democratic leadership on a border funding bill.
“I have no regrets about anything,” the California Democrat said as she left a closed-door meeting with Democrats Tuesday morning. “Regret is not what I do.”
Pelosi told the New York Times that Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat and three others who led an unsuccessful effort to defeat a $4.6 billion bipartisan border emergency funding bill lacked influence in the legislative process.
“All these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world,” Pelosi told the New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd in a weekend piece. “But they didn’t have any following. They’re four people and that’s how many votes they got.”
Pelosi repeated those sentiments Wednesday as she left the Democratic Caucus meeting.
“Four people voted for the bill and no other people followed,” Pelosi told reporters.
In addition to Ocasio-Cortez, Democratic Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, voted against the $4.6 billion border funding bill that was a bipartisan product of the Senate.
The four lawmakers were pushing for provisions in the House bill that would have put limitations on detaining illegal immigrants and added requirements for services and treatment.
[Related: Pelosi urges House Democrats to avoid Twitter fights within the family]
House Democrats, however, had little choice but to back the Senate bipartisan bill because the emergency funding was desperately needed to deal with a massive surge of illegal immigrants on the southern border and it’s the only measure that could clear Congress and win Trump’s signature.
When asked if she had regrets about making the remarks about Ocasio-Cortez and company, Pelosi responded, “No, I do not.”
Pelosi took a veiled jab at Ocasio-Cortez's chief of staff Saikat Chakrabarti, who insulted the speaker on Twitter in response to the dust-up between Democratic leadership and first-term members.
“All these articles want to claim what a legislative mastermind Pelosi is, but I'm seeing way more strategic smarts from freshman members like @AOC, @IlhanMN , @RashidaTlai and @AyannaPressley. Pelosi is just mad that she got outmaneuvered (again) by Republicans,” Chakrabarti tweeted.
Pelosi, who was walking past reporters, stopped in her tracks to let reporters know that “by the way, our caucus is very upset about some of the comments that have come from some of the staff of …”
Pelosi stopped short of saying Ocasio-Cortez, adding, “Perhaps you are not aware of what is going on?”

Texto completo: Trump ramping up criticisms of Fox
NEW YORK -- President Donald Trump's latest Twitter attack on the media focuses on Fox News, although it's hardly the first time he's found fault with the network where he most often finds a friendly reception.
Trump wrote Sunday that watching Fox on the weekend was worse than watching CNN and MSNBC, and criticized the network for using The New York Times as a source. The president was said to be angered by Fox segments on the immigration crisis that cited a Sunday Times story, and a live shot from France where a profane chant about Trump broke out among bar patrons celebrating the United States' World Cup victory over the Netherlands.
Advisers say it's important to Trump that Fox remains "loyal" to him to balance networks he feels are against him.
U.N. human rights chief 'deeply shocked' by condition of detention centers
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet said on Monday she is "appalled by the conditions" being forced upon migrants after crossing the southern U.S. border and admonished the federal government for failing to find noncustodial alternatives.
"Any deprivation of liberty of adult migrants and refugees should be a measure of last resort," she said, adding that where detention is necessary it should be for the shortest period and under conditions that satisfy international human rights standards.
"Clearly, border management measures must comply with the State's human rights obligations and should not be based on narrow policies aimed only at detecting, detaining and expeditiously deporting irregular migrants," Bachelet said.
Trump raises eyebrows in promoting his environment record
WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump is promoting what he is calling his administration's "environmental leadership" despite its sweeping rollbacks of landmark environmental and public health protections. Critics are calling it a credulity-straining gesture aimed at winning over voters worried about climate change and pollution.
Trump's speech at the White House on Monday afternoon will focus on the administration's "practical approach to addressing environmental challenges while also supporting a strong economy," Mary Neumayr, who heads the president's Council on Environmental Quality, told reporters in previewing his remarks.
Polls show increasing numbers of voters are identifying the environment and climate change as priorities, although the issues are a much bigger concern for Democrats rather than for Trump's Republican base.
Trump has a tough case to make as an environmental steward given his record, according to former environmental advocates and former federal regulators.
Mustafa Santiago Ali, a former official in the Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Environmental Justice, said the White House is recognizing that "the majority of folks in the country are now beginning to pay attention to climate issues and environmental issues."

Texto completo: The El Paso Times and USA TODAY stand firm in the accuracy of its reporting and continues to be a leading and impartial voice in the coverage of border security and immigration.
Note: This editorial is in response to President Donald Trump's criticism of the El Paso Times and New York Times collaborative reporting on conditions in the Clint facility.
The strength of the partnership between the El Paso Times and the New York Times lies in the fact that you have a team of reporters and editors who understand the immigration crisis and are subject matter experts.
The journalists spoke to current and former Customs and Border Protection agents and supervisors who work or have worked at the detention facility in Clint, TX. These agents and supervisors are witnesses to the severe problems at the secretive site and spoke on condition that they not be named because of fear they will face repercussions for exposing such squalid conditions.
The journalists reviewed CBP documents, sworn statements from those housed at the border facilities, inspection reports, spoke with immigration attorneys and lawmakers who toured the facility and also provided first-hand accounts.
The on-the-ground reporting also led to the creation of a graphic that outlines the detention center, from cinder block cells, holding rooms, nurses' station, and a padded cell, with no toilet, where sick children were quarantined and sometimes held.
The El Paso Times and USA TODAY stand firm in the accuracy of its reporting and continues to be a leading and impartial voice in the coverage of border security and immigration. The New York Times issued a statement: "We are confident in the accuracy of our reporting on the U.S. Border Patrol's detention centers."

Texto completo: "They said, 'We were ringing the alarms, we were ringing the alarms, and nobody was listening to us' — agents told me that. I genuinely believe that the higher-ups made the Clint situation happen."
Mary E. González
Texas lawmaker
CLINT — Since the Border Patrol opened its station in Clint in 2013, it was a fixture in this West Texas farm town.
Separated from the surrounding cotton fields and cattle pastures by a razor-wire fence, the station stood on the town's main road, near a feed store, the Good News Apostolic Church and La Indita Tortillería. Most people around Clint had little idea of what went on inside. Agents came and went in pickups; buses pulled into the gates with the occasional load of children apprehended at the border, four miles south.
But inside the secretive site that is now on the front lines of the southwest border crisis, the men and women who work there were grappling with the stuff of nightmares.
Outbreaks of scabies, shingles and chickenpox were spreading among the hundreds of children who were being held in cramped cells, agents said.
The stench of the children's dirty clothing was so strong it spread to the agents' own clothing — people in town would scrunch their noses when they left work.
The children cried constantly. One girl seemed likely enough to try to kill herself that the agents made her sleep on a cot in front of them, so they could watch her as they were processing new arrivals.
"It gets to a point where you start to become a robot," said a veteran Border Patrol agent who has worked at the Clint station since it was built.
He described following orders to take beds away from children to make more space in holding cells, part of a daily routine that he said had become "heartbreaking."
The little-known Border Patrol facility at Clint has suddenly become the public face of the chaos on America's southern border, after immigration lawyers began reporting on the children they saw — some of them as young as 5 months old — and the filthy, overcrowded conditions in which they were being held.
Border Patrol leaders, including Aaron Hull, the outspoken chief patrol agent of the agency's El Paso Sector, have disputed descriptions of degrading conditions inside Clint and other migrant detention sites around El Paso, claiming that their facilities were rigorously and humanely managed even after a spate of deaths of migrant children in federal custody.
But a review of the operations of the Clint station, near El Paso's eastern edge, shows that the agency's leadership knew for months that some children had no beds to sleep on, no way to clean themselves and sometimes went hungry. Its own agents had raised the alarm, and found themselves having to accommodate even more new arrivals.
The accounts of what happened at Clint and at nearby border facilities are based on dozens of interviews by The New York Times and The El Paso Times of current and former Border Patrol agents and supervisors; lawyers, lawmakers and aides who visited the facility; and an immigrant father whose children were held there. The review also included sworn statements from those who spent time at El Paso border facilities, inspection reports and accounts from neighbors in Clint.
The conditions at Clint represent a conundrum not just for local officials, but for Congress, where lawmakers spent weeks battling over the terms of a $4.6 billion humanitarian aid package for facilities at the border. The lack of federal investment, some argue, is why the sites have been so strained. But the reports of squalor prompted several Democratic lawmakers to vote against the final bill, which did not have oversight and enforcement provisions.
By all accounts, the Border Patrol's attempt to continue making room for new children at Clint even as it was unable to find space to send them to better-equipped facilities was a source of concern for many people who worked there. "I can't tell you the number of times I would talk to agents and they would get teary-eyed," said one agent, a veteran of 13 years with Border Patrol who worked at Clint.
Mary E. González, a Democratic state lawmaker who toured the Clint station last week, said that Border Patrol agents told her they had repeatedly warned their superiors about the overcrowded facility, but that federal officials had taken no action.
"They said, 'We were ringing the alarms, we were ringing the alarms, and nobody was listening to us' — agents told me that," Ms. González said. "I genuinely believe that the higher-ups made the Clint situation happen."
A forward operating base Architects designed the Clint station as a type of forward base — replete with fueling stations, garages for all-terrain vehicles and horse stables — from which agents could go on forays along the border. The station was never intended to hold more than about a hundred adult men, and it was designed with the idea that migrants would be detained for only a few hours of processing before being transferred to other locations.
Officials have allowed reporters and members of Congress on controlled tours of Clint, but prohibited them from bringing phones or cameras inside, and from entering certain areas.
But through interviews with dozens of people with knowledge of the station — including lawyers, former detainees and staff members — The Times was able to model the main areas where children were held: the station's central processing area, with its cinder-block cells; a converted loading area and yard; and a warehouse on the property.
Parts of the site resemble what might be seen at many government buildings. Photographs in the hallway celebrate the work of the Border Patrol, showing agents on horseback and in all-terrain vehicles. A conference room features high-backed chairs upholstered with faux leather. But the sense of normalcy fades away the deeper one goes into the station. A detachment of Coast Guard personnel, sent to assist overworked agents, stock an ad hoc pantry with items like oatmeal and instant noodles. Monitors in blue shirts roam the station, hired through an outside contractor to supervise the detained children.
Beyond the pantry, a door leads to the site's processing center, equipped with about 10 cells. One day this month, about 20 girls were crowded into one cell, so packed that some were sprawled on the floor. Toddlers could be seen in some cells, cared for by older children. One of the cells functioned as a quarantine unit or "flu cell" for children with contagious diseases; employees have at times worn medical masks and gloves to protect themselves.
A part of the processing area was set aside for detained children to make phone calls to family members. Many broke into tears upon hearing the voices of loved ones, episodes so common that some agents merely shrugged in response.
Clint is known for holding what agents call U.A.C.'s, or unaccompanied alien children — children who cross the border alone or with relatives who are not their parents. Three agents who work at Clint said they had seen unaccompanied children as young as 3 enter the facility, and lawyers who recently inspected the site as part of a lawsuit on migrant children's rights said they saw children as young as 5 months old.
An agent who has worked for Border Patrol for 13 years — and who, like others interviewed for this story, spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the situation — confirmed reports by immigration lawyers that agents have asked migrants who are teenagers to help care for the younger children.
"We have nine agents processing, two agents in charge of U.A.C. care and we have little ones that need their diapers changed, and we can't do that," the agent said. "We can't carry them or change diapers. We do ask the older juveniles, the 16-year-olds or 17-year-olds, to help us out with that."
As immigration flows change, the scene inside Clint has shifted as well. The number of children in the site is thought to have peaked at more than 700 around April and May, and stood at nearly 250 two weeks ago. In an attempt to relieve overcrowding, agents took all the children out of Clint but then moved more than 100 back into the station just days later.
Unaccompanied boys are kept in a converted loading area that holds about 50 people. Until a few weeks ago, older boys were kept in a tent encampment outside. Families, including adult parents, were also sent to Clint earlier this year, and Representative Will Hurd, a Republican whose Texas district includes Clint, said that 11 adult males "apprehended that morning" were also being held at the site when he visited on June 29.
Before the influx of migrants began to wane in recent weeks, the agents said they had kept the families in a warehouse normally used to house ATVs. It was converted into two holding areas initially intended to house 50 people each.
A chief agent under fire At least two Border Patrol agents at Clint said they had expressed concern about the conditions in the station to their superiors months ago. Even before that, senior Homeland Security officials in Washington had significant concerns about the El Paso Sector's brash chief patrol agent and his oversight of the facility over the past year, when tighter security along other sections of the border prompted a steep rise in migrant crossings along the section that runs from New Mexico through West Texas.
The situation became so severe that in January, officials at Customs and Border Protection, the agency that oversees the Border Patrol, took the unusual move of ordering the sector chief, Hull, to come to headquarters in Washington for a face-to-face meeting.
The officials were concerned that Hull had moved too slowly to put safety measures in place after the deaths of migrant children, according to a Homeland Security official. After the meeting, Hull moved forward with the new procedures. But tension has persisted between Hull and officials in Washington, particularly in recent months, as the number of migrants continued to increase at his facilities.
The officials believe that Hull and Matthew Harris, the chief of the Clint station, have been slow to follow directives and communicate developments at the facilities in their sector, according to two Homeland Security officials.
Hull is seen as a hard-liner on immigration issues. He has often been heard saying that migrants exaggerate the problems they face in their home countries.
Officials at the border agency declined multiple interview requests.
Last month, the acting head of C.B.P., John Sanders, ordered an internal investigation into the Clint facility. The investigation — which is being conducted by the agency's Office of Professional Responsibility and the department's inspector general — has examined allegations of misconduct. As part of the review, investigators have conducted interviews and watched hours of video footage to see how agents treated detainees. So far, investigators have found little evidence to substantiate allegations of misconduct. But they have found that the facility is several times over capacity and has horrendous conditions.
The uproar over the site is drawing scrutiny on Border Patrol facilities that are some of the least-regulated migrant detention centers in the United States.
That is in part because they are intended in most cases to hold migrants for no more than 72 hours, before they are turned over to better-equipped facilities operated by other government agencies with stricter regulations on, say, the number of toilets and showers required. But the 72-hour limit has been frequently breached during the current migrant surge; some children have been housed at Clint for weeks on end.
Lawyers who visited the Clint station described children in filthy clothes, often lacking diapers and with no access to toothbrushes, toothpaste or soap, prompting people around the country to donate supplies that the Border Patrol turned away.
An inspector arrives One day in April, a man from Washington arrived unannounced around midday at the Clint station. He introduced himself as Henry Moak, and told the agents inside that he was there to inspect the site in his role as Customs and Border Protection's chief accountability officer.
The Clint station was far over capacity on the day of Moak's visit, bulging with 291 children. Moak found evidence of a lice infestation; children also told him about going hungry and being forced to sleep on the floors.
One girl, a 14-year-old from El Salvador, had been in custody for 14 days in Clint, including a nine-day stretch in a nearby hospital during which Border Patrol agents accompanied her and kept her under surveillance. Moak did not specify in his report why the girl had been rushed to the hospital. When the girl returned to Clint, another child had taken her bed so she had to sleep on the floor.
Two sisters from Honduras, one 11 and the other 7, told Moak that they had to sleep on benches in the facility's hold room, getting their own cot only when other children were transferred out. "The sisters told me they had not showered or brushed their teeth since arriving at Clint station," Moak said in his report. Showers had been offered twice during the girls' time in custody, but the girls were asleep each time, his review showed. Moak in the end stated that Clint was in compliance with standards.
One of a team of lawyers who inspected the station in June, Warren Binford, director of the clinical law program at Willamette University in Oregon, said that in all her years of visiting detention and shelter facilities, she had never encountered conditions so bad — 351 children crammed into what she described as a prisonlike environment.
She looked at the roster, and was shocked to see more than 100 very young children listed. "My God, these are babies, I realized. They are keeping babies here," she recalled.
One teenage mother from El Salvador said Border Patrol agents at the border had taken her medicine for her infant son, who had a fever.
"Did they throw away anything else?" Binford said she had asked her.
"Everything," she replied. "They threw away my baby's diapers, formula, bottle, baby food and clothes. They threw away everything."
Once at Clint, she told Binford, the baby's fever came back and she begged the agents for more medicine. "Who told you to come to America with your baby, anyway?" one of the agents told her, according to the young woman's account to Binford.
Border Patrol agents have said they have adequate supplies at Clint for most of the migrants' needs. The facility lacks a kitchen, they said, so the ramen, granola bars, instant oatmeal and burritos that serve as most of the sustenance for migrants has been the best they could do.
Children sometimes could be seen crying, said one Border Patrol agent, who has worked for seven years at the Clint facility, but it most often seemed to be because they missed their parents. "It's never because they're mistreated; it's because they're homesick," she said.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump tweeted on Sunday about The El Paso Times, New York Times article detailing degrading conditions at the Clint, Texas, Border Patrol facility.
"The Fake News Media, in particular the Failing @nytimes, is writing phony and exaggerated accounts of the Border Detention Centers."
"First of all, people should not be entering our Country illegally, only for us to then have to care for them. We should be allowed to focus on United States Citizens first. Border Patrol, and others in Law Enforcement, have been doing a great job."
"We said there was a Crisis — the Fake News & the Dems said it was "manufactured." Now all agree we were right, but they always knew that. They are crowded (which we ... brought up, not them) because the Dems won't change the Loopholes and Asylum. Big Media Con Job!"
The article includes claims of disease outbreaks, and that the smell of children's dirty clothing was so strong it spread to agents' clothing at the Clint Border Patrol facility.
The report was based on the accounts of current and former Border Patrol employees, lawyers, lawmakers and aides who visited the facility. It also included the account of an immigrant father of children held there. It included sworn statements from people who spent time at the facilities, inspection reports and accounts from neighbors.
The station holds unaccompanied children and has faced protests and criticism after lawyers who visited the facility last month alleged children were being neglected.
The New York Times responded to Trump on Twitter that they are confident in the accuracy of the reporting on the Border Patrol detention centers.
"The accounts of what happened at Clint and at nearby border facilities are based on dozens of interviews by The New York Times and The El Paso Times of current and former Border Patrol agents and supervisors; lawyers, lawmakers and aides who visited the facility; and an immigrant father whose children were held there. The review also included sworn statements from those who spent time at El Paso border facilities, inspection reports and accounts from neighbors in Clint," a statement read.
Monday, The El Paso Times published a response defending the accuracy of the reporting in the article.
"The El Paso Times and USA TODAY stand firm in the accuracy of its reporting and continues to be a leading and impartial voice in the coverage of border security and immigration," Executive Editor Tim Archuleta said in the response.
Border Patrol Chief takes to CNN to dispute claims A Border Patrol leader has disputed claims of degrading conditions at the Clint, Texas, Border Patrol station.
During a Monday morning interview with CNN, U.S. Border Patrol El Paso Sector Chief Aaron Hull said that the Clint facility is constantly inspected.
"I would dispute that the conditions are so bad as have been reported," Hull said during the interview. "I can't understand why some people would be making some of the allegations that they're making."
The article read that in a review of the operations of the Clint station, "the agency's leadership knew for months that some children had no beds to sleep on, no way to clean themselves and sometimes went hungry. Its own agents had raised the alarm and found themselves having to accommodate even more new arrivals."
When CNN's Alisyn Camerota asked Hull to clarify if he was disputing the reported outbreaks of scabies, shingles, chickenpox, lice and the flu, he said the term outbreak isn't accurate.
"The term outbreak implies that it's something somehow occurring or being caused in our facility," Hull said. "These are people that we encounter with these conditions. We address them medically and we isolate and quarantine them from others. We have to do that in addition to all of the other challenges we face."
He said it isn't true that people are being denied showers or access to hygiene facilities, and that a lot of agents have had to teach children basic hygiene.
"Every two days these children are getting offered shower facilities," Hull told CNN. "Now we cannot make them shower. We can take them to the shower, and we can put them there, but we can't physically make them shower. It's the same thing with brushing their teeth. We encounter children who've never brushed their teeth."
He said they have also brought in contracted professionals who aren't agents to help encourage children to practice good hygiene.
Hull said the overcrowded conditions are not new, and the facilities will remain overcrowded until other entities like Health and Human Services are funded to take the children out of Border Patrol custody as soon as possible.
"We've been talking about overcrowded conditions for some time. That's no secret," he said. "Everyone from us up through the president has talked about that, that it continues to be a problem. But in terms of the care that they're being provided, the access to food, shower, hygiene, laundry, the things that we're doing, we continue to be inspected on that."

Texto completo: Joe Biden and I go back a long way — more than four decades. In that time, he has taught me two crucial life lessons. Now, I’m hoping he will provide a third one.
As a 15-year-old in 1972, I read about the tragic deaths of his first wife, Neilia, and their 1-year-old daughter. Only a few years before they were killed in a car wreck, my mother had bought us matching stationery sets. Hers read “Mrs. Margot Petrow” and mine “Steve Petrow. ” Already a veteran letter writer, I took pen to paper and wrote Joe Biden a note of condolence.
I kept no copy of my missive, but I’ve held onto Biden’s response for 47 years now. His letter came in a heavy, cream-colored envelope with the return address, "United States Senate, Washington, D. C. ," engraved in dark blue in the left corner. He addressed it to "Mr. Petrow," probably the first time anyone had called me that:
"I offer a belated thank-you for your kind words of condolence. I deeply appreciate your sentiments. I owed so very much to Neilia. She had a talent for making not only her own life worthwhile but also the lives of those around her. She was both a loving mother and a loving wife. In addition, she was my political confidant, in whose judgment I had implicit and utmost trust. Neilia looked forward to our coming to Washington. Now our life has been completely torn apart by an event I shall never completely comprehend. Neilia deserved better.
"Best wishes, Joe Biden"
Joe Biden, the role model
Back then, I knew nothing about illness, much less death — but Joe Biden’s family tragedy taught me about the random hands of the fates that can appear in no time from nowhere. In time, too soon in fact, I’d learn these lessons more fully, especially when I was diagnosed with cancer.
I had only a glimmer that in life, to borrow from mystery writer Dashiell Hammett, men die “at haphazard like that” and live “only while blind chance” spares them. The vice president himself put it even more simply in his 2015 graduation speech at Yale: “Reality has a way of intruding” into one’s life. That was Biden Lesson No. 1.
She would have done the same: Dear Kamala Harris, here's why Joe Biden worked with segregationists in the Senate
Since then, which adds up to much of my adult life, I’ve looked to Joe Biden as a role model — as a father, a spouse, a politician and simply as a man. Along the way, “Uncle Joe” (just one of his many nicknames) has made any number of gaffes (calling fellow presidential candidate Barack Obama “the first sort of mainstream African American who is articulate and bright and clean”), misstatements (asking a state senator who is paralyzed to stand up), “sleepy creepy” moments (President Donald Trump’s nod to Biden’s longtime disposition to be too touchy-feely with women). Call them whatever you want, I believed his heart was always in the right place even when his mouth — or hands — indicated otherwise.
In the sad spring of 2015, I, like many Americans, followed Joe and Jill Biden’s public embrace of their son Beau, who died of brain cancer. Again, I wrote Biden. Like Beau I, too, had had cancer at an early age. Unlike Beau, I survived. Joe Biden’s open expression of his heart, his pain and his public anguish reminded me of the depth of this man’s feelings and his ability to connect to others, especially those who had endured personal loss.
“Dear Mr. Vice President,
"I am very sorry to hear about the loss of your son, Beau. Forty-three years ago you wrote to thank me for a condolence note I had sent you as a teenager on the passing of your wife and daughter. If anything your letter taught me that life’s complexities can’t always be understood and that they must be accepted, with the prayer that something good will follow. ”
I did not hear back from the vice president, but that was OK. I believed that Biden might be able to translate this new loss into major advances for cancer treatment, especially when he spearheaded President Obama’s cancer moonshot program, which the vice president promised would “double the rate of progress in preventing, diagnosing and treating cancer. ”
When overpromising become lying: Joe Biden says he'll cure cancer. Sounds like the kind of lie Donald Trump would tell.
In a speech days before leaving office in 2017, the vice president, as he often had throughout his life, brought the personal to the political, in this case the medical. “Like many of you," Biden said, "I decided to become acquainted with this after someone close to me in my family was diagnosed. You tend to try to learn everything you possibly can once that occurs. And I knew little about the discipline. And like I said, what impressed me was that so much of this is really very brand new in terms of the collaboration. ”
And there it was, Biden Lesson No. 2: Resilience in the face of adversity.
I hadn’t realized at the time how much such a lesson would mean. My mother had died 10 days earlier, and my father would pass 90 days later. A half-year later my little sister, a wife and mother of two girls, would be diagnosed with stage 4 ovarian cancer. With Julie’s diagnosis, if anyone now needed a moonshot — or just a plain shot in the arm — it was our family. Joe Biden gave me hope.
Not the man for this moment
In recent months, I’ve watched Biden with anticipation, only to find my enthusiasm curbed. He has rightfully been criticized for his role as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee during the 1991 Anita Hill hearings, and he recently told the hosts of ABC's "The View": "Look at what I said and didn’t say; I don’t think I treated her badly. ”
His record speaks for itself: I was with Joe Biden when no one was looking, and he was always a champion for women
When it comes to his history of inappropriately touching women, the former veep — despite a video statement declaring “I get it” — continues to make jokes about this topic.
Then, in the first presidential debates late last month, I watched Biden — my teenage hero and midlife role model — lose his footing in front of more than 18 million viewers.
The details of his exchange with Sen. Kamala Harris of California are well known: She accused him of cozying up to two segregationist senators under the guise of civility, and he then gave a states rights defense of his opposition to busing as a means to achieve integration. Suffice it to say, Joe Biden showed us that when it comes to gender and race, he’s out of step with these times. Instead, I wish he had given me a third life lesson: Don’t confuse a mea culpa or a real, genuine apology with weakness. It’s about being human.
Over the weekend, Biden asked a South Carolina crowd rhetorically whether he was “wrong a few weeks ago to somehow give the impression to folks that I was praising those people who I opposed time and again?” “Yes, I was,” he answered. His quasi apology for the "pain and misconception it may have caused" was both a day late and a dollar short — actually more like nine days late.
Biden has taught me so much in my lifetime — about loss, about love, about virtue. I now wish the former vice president would extend a final lesson as a public servant and show us how to make a graceful exit before his accomplishments of the past are erased by this new day. We, too, owe him that.
Joe Biden means too much to me and to so many other Americans for his next — and final political chapter — to be one of missteps and gaffes, but most of all a tone deafness that reveals a man whose time has come and is now over.

The many faces of E. Jean Carroll

Texto completo: In the days since E. Jean Carroll said that she was assaulted over 20 years ago by Donald Trump, she has been questioned and scrutinized for both the story she's told, and the winding, sometimes colorful way that she has told it.
And yet, Carroll says, this moment is "probably one of the most carefree and happy times of my life."
"I've been in a cocoon of love and support," Carroll told USA TODAY in a phone interview Tuesday, adding that people have been sending her messages, texts and even approaching her on the street. "It's just been overwhelmingly delightful."
Her response is likely not what some would have imagined. But Carroll has spent a lifetime defying expectations.
A former beauty queen, she became a pioneer in the world of literary journalism.
A daughter of the Midwest, she found renown in the elite media circles of New York. And in her 70s, Carroll remains a beacon to millions of readers seeking out her frank talk about sex, success and love.
Lisa Chase remembers the first time she read a piece by Carroll.
"I thought she was hilarious," says Chase, who first edited Carroll 30 years ago when Chase was an editor with Outside magazine. "When you hire E. Jean, you want a funny story with feeling and empathy."
But though the two women became friends, Carroll's account of being sexually assaulted by Donald Trump in a posh Manhattan department store more than 20 years ago was one Carroll never shared.
"I was asking her for years to write a memoir," says Chase, who edited Carroll's advice column in Elle magazine from 2005 to 2017. "I had no idea she had these stories. She kept them to herself."
Carroll's book, "What Do We Need Men For?" details an allegation, first excerpted in New York magazine, that Trump assaulted her in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room in the mid-1990s. Two of Carroll's friends have confirmed to The New York Times that she told them about the incident shortly after it allegedly occurred. Trump has denied assaulting her. The book went on sale to the public Tuesday.
"Totally lying. I don't know anything about her," Trump said. "I know nothing about this woman. I know nothing about her. She is – it's just a terrible thing that people can make statements like that."
But long before this fraught moment in the media's glare, Carroll was a journalistic luminary, known for her Ask E. Jean advice column, and for being a presence amid the glitzy nightlife scene of 1980s and '90s New York.
"There's a circuit in New York," Chase says. "You go out to events. You go to premieres. You go to dinner parties. She was on TV. She was writing. She was beautiful and smart and funny. She was married to a person (John Johnson) who was a big on-air personality. She was in that world."
Carroll carved a niche in television, writing for "Saturday Night Live" in the 1980s and hosting her own "Ask E. Jean" show on MSNBC's predecessor, America's Talking, from 1994 to 1996.
But her writing, featured in such publications as Rolling Stone and Playboy – where Carroll became the first woman to be named a contributing editor – established Carroll as a trailblazer.
"That was the tabloid era," says Roger Friedman, editor in chief of the entertainment news website Showbiz411, who edited Fame magazine from 1987 to 1991 and later wrote New York magazine's Intelligencer column. "People were chasing scoops. You didn't have cellphones. You didn't have the internet. You had to get up, put your hat on and get the story. She was a person out talking to people."
Carroll became known for a style of writing and reporting dubbed gonzo journalism. A hallmark of writers such as Hunter S. Thompson, whose biography Carroll wrote, and Tom Wolfe, it was a school of storytelling in which journalists often made themselves part of the tale, offering up humorous – sometimes outrageous – personal experiences.
"In the literary journalism world, she was a player, which is saying a lot," Chase says. "There weren't a lot of women who were being hired by men's magazines. And she was."
Carroll also drew comparisons to famed writer Nora Ephron.
"Both are fiendish reporters who find their subject matter in left field," Kirkus Review wrote in a critique of "Female Difficulties: Sorority Sisters, Rodeo Queens, Frigid Women, Smut Stars, And Other Modern Girls," a book Carroll wrote in the 1980s.
"Carroll, though, is wilder than Ephron, content not just to set a scene but sometimes to steal one, too."
Candace Bushnell, the writer whose "Sex and the City" column in the New York Observer inspired the HBO show of the same name, was a fan.
"I've known E. Jean or known of her since at least the '80s," Bushnell said in an email.
"She was the coolest woman journalist around – daring, had a ton of guts, and was as funny as the guys. She was a female gonzo journalist. In the mid-nineties I hung out with her quite a bit. There really wasn't and isn't anyone else like her."
Chase says the last piece she asked Carroll to write was about an all-woman rafting trip. "I think we called it women who run with no clothes on because at some point in the trip all the women took off their clothes and rafted naked down the river, which I'm sure was her idea. She's had an adventurous life."
Elizabeth Jean "Jeannie" Carroll's journey started out much more conventionally.
Carroll spent her childhood in Fort Wayne, Indiana, the oldest of four children in a family that included a younger brother and two sisters.
It was a Midwestern life, in mid-century America. But Carroll felt that she could be whatever, and whoever, she wanted to be. "I was free," she told USA TODAY.
"I grew up in the '40s and '50s. I rode my bike all over town. I started to drive when I was 14. Just trying being 35. The world will knock you down, pay you less, tell you you're not as good. But when you're a kid, everything is possible."
Carroll's writing ambitions bloomed early. "I was filling the U.S. mail with pitches to magazines at the age of 12," she remembers. "So apparently I thought of myself as a writer. I mean, if I'm writing to the Sears and Roebuck catalog, pitching a story to them, I guess I wanted to be a writer."
A member of the class of 1967, Carroll was named Miss Indiana University, as well as Miss Cheerleader U.S.A., which earned her a scholarship.
Carroll also was a member of the Pi Beta Phi sorority, but in an article in the October 1996 issue of Indianapolis Monthly, she says that the group "kicked me out 20 years later for something I wrote for Playboy about sorority rush. I wasn't too kind."
The first time Carroll touched down in New York was after college.
"I thought it was the most marvelous place in the world," she said.
Her first job? "Honda had their new motorcycle, and I sat on the Honda and greeted people at the World's Fair in the Japanese exhibit right across from the Japanese tea ceremony people. It was fabulous."
People from Indiana visiting the exhibition recognized her, asking if she was that cheerleader who'd been Miss Indiana University. "I'd say, 'No, who are you talking about?'"
After that first brush with Manhattan, Carroll traveled to Africa, lived in Montana with her first husband, Steve Byers, and spent some time in Chicago. But after she landed a piece in Esquire, Carroll's writing career began to take off.
She returned to New York to interview Fran Lebowitz for the cover of Outside magazine, and she stayed for good.
"I had jeans, cowgirl boots, a fringe jacket, a couple of shirts," she says. "And that's it."
In her book, Carroll says that she had met Trump only once before the day she says she encountered him at Bergdorf Goodman. Trump, meanwhile, has said that he doesn't know her.
However, there is a photograph showing that their paths did cross. Dated "around 1987," it is a shot of Carroll; her then-husband, former New York City anchorman John Johnson; and Trump with his first wife, Ivana.
At the time the picture was taken, Times Square had not yet become the tourist mecca some now disparagingly liken to Disneyland. In those days, visitors to New York still were being warned not to ride the subway after dark.
"In the '80s, everyone worried about getting mugged," Friedman recalled. "There was graffiti everywhere and your car was constantly broken into. Cars all had signs that said 'no radio inside.' "
But New York also was the capital of media, finance and fashion, and for a glittering set, it was a glamorous, golden era. Studio 54, the legendary disco, shut its doors in 1980, but new nightspots such as Nell's rose up on the scene, and eateries including Michael's were among the cool corners where the chic and powerful gathered.
The legendary bar and restaurant Elaine's was frequented by a local who's who of writers, actors and artists.
"I lived in Elaine's," Carroll said. "I knew everybody there. I was sitting at the writers table and that was heaven on Earth. You could go in at any time and there was always a table of writers, and you would just sit down. Sometimes detectives would join us. Sometimes prizefighters. But there was always a writers table, and it was usually on a Thursday night."
Everyone who was anyone in the world of publishing would pass through, she says, including Jackie Kennedy, Norman Mailer, Gay Talese.
Carroll's writing style and voice has informed her recounting of Trump's alleged sexual assault. And some have questioned the way she has described a traumatic event, as well as her refusal to call what she says happened "rape."
"Every woman gets to choose her word," Carroll said in an interview on The New York Times' The Daily podcast. "Every woman gets to choose how she describes it. I have not been raped. Something has not been done to me. I fought. That's the thing.''
Carroll told USA TODAY that there is no mystery to how she comes up with the nuggets she dispenses to her readers.
"Giving advice is just following common sense," she says. "Nothing special. That's it. I think that's why a lot of therapists write to me. They have studied for years and years and years, the psychology and the human being, but sometimes it's just a common-sense thing and the simplest advice will work."

Texto completo: Now we know why the Democrats were so upset about President Donald Trump speaking on the Fourth of July. It was not because it was political or partisan. It was patriotic, and that is what annoys the left the most.
Days before the speech, we heard that Trump was hijacking Independence Day and turning it into a campaign rally. But Trump never mentioned the 2020 campaign in his speech. We heard that Trump's desire to have tanks on the National Mall was an out-and-out authoritarian performance art. But that wasn't really the issue. Neither was the fake outrage over the cost.
There was no mention of political opponents and no mention of the fake news media. And this wasn't Trump co-opting the nation's birthday to celebrate himself. In fact, for a man who loves to talk about his accomplishments, he never mentioned himself.
No, Trump did something far more dangerous to the left. He gave America a strong dose of patriotism. He gave Americans a history lesson of the past 243 years.
Last week, The New York Times ran a video arguing that America isn't the greatest nation on earth: "The U.S. is really just OK."
Without mentioning The Times or the video, Trump proceeded to tell us about America's greatness for nearly an hour interrupted only by applause, flyovers and military songs: "Today, we come together as one nation with this very special Salute To America. We celebrate our history, our people and the heroes who proudly defend our flag -- the brave men and women of the United States military!"
Boy, did he. Starting with the story of America's war for independence.
'The fate of unborn millions'
Trump told the story of Gen. George Washington as he readied his troops to fight the British. Trump said, "Washington's message to his troops laid bare the stakes. He wrote, 'The fate of unborn millions will now depend, under God, on the courage and conduct of this army. We have, therefore, to resolve to conquer or die.'"
In reminding America of the great acts of past generations, Trump brought it to the present by honoring our first responders and all of the men and women of law enforcement. Trump also honored the Gold Star families who made the ultimate sacrifice.
He introduced NASA legend Gene Kranz and told him that we're going back to the moon, and that we're going to plant our flag on Mars.
He also introduced civil rights icon Clarence Henderson, who was 18 in 1960 when he took part in a sit-in at a Woolworth's lunch counter in Greensboro, North Carolina. "He sits tonight in a seat of honor," Trump said. "Clarence, thank you for making this a much better place for all Americans."
I found it very unifying, but there were some triggers for the left.
A new tradition
Trump said, "This country (is) the most exceptional nation in the history of the world." American exceptionalism annoys the left.
"We are one people, chasing one dream and one magnificent destiny," Trump said. "We all share the same heroes, the same home, the same heart, and we are all made by the same almighty God." Mentioning God annoys the left.
I think this should become a tradition for every president from now on. With all of the partisan political fights, it was nice to be reminded of America's amazing heritage. It was inspiring, and that's what we need.
For one day, Trump put partisan politics aside and focused the eyes of America on our past, present and to our future. Thanks, Mr. President.

Texto completo: The League of Women Voters is pleased that the U.S. Supreme Court has not approved the addition of a citizenship question to the 2020 United States Census. Instead, justices sent the issue back to the Department of Commerce.
We hope that reason prevails and the question will not be added to the census. It would result in a serious undercount in New Mexico, costing the state $3,700 for every resident who goes uncounted. A 1 percent undercount in the 2020 census would result in the loss of $780 million over 10 years. We hope the courts and the administration finally do the right thing.

Safe at school
A friend sent me a copy of a letter sent to her grandson's family from New York City Schools Chancellor Richard Carranza. It reassured parents that they and their children were safe in the schools, both during the year and during the summer:
"No matter what happens on the federal level we as a city remain absolutely committed to keeping ALL students, including undocumented students, safe in our schools.
"We take pride in the fact that New York City is a city of immigrants. Our immigrant parents, students, principals, teachers, and staff are a vibrant and essential part of our system, and we value each and every one of you."
In conclusion, the chancellor wrote, "Whether you or your family arrived 100 years or 100 days ago, you are New Yorkers -- and we stand with you."
It touched my heart. I hope we might be doing something similar in our districts here in New Mexico.

Create disinformation
Concerning the recent decision of the U.S. Supreme Court allowing egregious gerrymandering of districts ("With No Supreme Court End to Gerrymandering, Will States Make It More Extreme," New York Times, June 28), the best possible response to partisan politicking that can be taken by a responsible citizen is to lie. Lie to pollsters. Lie to political scientists. Register as a Republican if you are a Democrat. Register as a Democrat if you are a Republican. Register as an independent. Do not give the political hacks the information they need to accurately gerrymander districts in their favor.
So much has been written about the invasion of our privacy recently, as well as about the sharing of our preferences, buying habits, tendencies and so forth. But our political views should be our most closely guarded information. I call out to the patriots among us to create a chaos of disinformation to combat those who attempt to undermine the free exercise of the polls. There would be a certain irony in using disinformation against them, would there not?

Speech for all
Steve Terrell's column about the group Cowboys for Trump ("Free speech covers cowboys, too," Roundhouse Roundup, June 23) and their proposed ride to the state Capitol was correct about the First Amendment applying to the cowboys. The First Amendment also applies to any peaceful protesters who protest against President Donald Trump.
I grew up believing in the saying "I may not agree with what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it." This is eroded if any side to an issue becomes violent or refuses to let the other side speak. So I support the right of the cowboys to parade, even though I regret their belief in Trump.
Unfortunately, we have become used to Trump's outrages -- constitutional, political, legal, moral, sexual -- and lost sight of what he is doing to our country. His stance on climate change will make a much worse world for our grandchildren. His treatment of immigrants is below contempt. Cutting taxes for the rich while cutting funds for Medicaid and Social Security shows where his loyalties lie. And Senate Republicans cheer him on.

Young Gauff must be handled with care

Texto completo: Coco Gauff was probably destined to be the biggest story in sports at some point in her life, but nobody could have anticipated that it would happen on a Friday in July of her 15th year on Earth.
What started as a Wimbledon curiosity and a cool, niche story has now become a real thing – a real, big thing – as Gauff advanced to the Round of 16 with a rousing comeback to beat Polona Hercog, 3-6, 7-6, 7-5.
No matter what happens from here, life will never be the same for Gauff – not just because she's into the second week of a Grand Slam at age 15, but because of how she's done it: with incredible athletic ability and mental toughness and a maturity that has captivated an American audience often indifferent to tennis.
Which is all the more reason why everyone around Gauff and the Women's Tennis Association must resist the urge to speed up this process.
Under the current WTA age restrictions, Gauff can only play 10 professional tournaments (with some merit-based flexibility) between her 15th and 16th birthday next March, with the limits increasing each year until she turns 18. Gauff's father, Corey, has been pushing for the rule to be relaxed and made some solid points earlier this week in an interview with The New York Times.
But tennis is a sport that has too often chewed up its prodigies before they're fully-formed adults, leaving a trail of burnout, chronic injury and family dysfunction. And as Gauff ascends into a stratosphere of fame that seemed unlikely this early, it's all the more reason for tennis to be extra careful about not screwing this one up.
From all indications, the Gauff family seems to get it. Corey, a former college basketball player at Georgia State, has been careful about his daughter's path up to this point. He says he's spent years studying the flame-outs, the success stories and everyone in-between to chart a course for Coco that will allow her a long pro career and the best chance at maintaining balance. In the player box, Corey and his wife, Candi, have given the appearance of being supportive and extraordinarily normal, which isn't always the case with tennis parents.
But it's inevitable now that things are going to change for the Gauffs. Though people within the niche tennis world have known about Coco Gauff for awhile – Roger Federer's management company, Team 8, signed her in late 2017, and New Balance became her apparel sponsor last October – everything is different when you break out as a mainstream star. It's possible that she made millions of dollars in sponsorships based solely on what she did Friday afternoon on a holiday weekend with millions of Americans being drawn in.
And clearly, she has enough tools to play like a legit pro, having beaten Venus Williams, the 139th-ranked Magdalena Rybarikova and the 60th-ranked Hercog to get into the fourth round.
But it's also worth remembering that Gauff – whose ranking will rocket from No. 313 to at least No. 139 even if she loses to Simona Halep on Monday – hasn't had much success at the highest level of pro tennis prior to Wimbledon. Gauff has made a couple of deep runs at developmental-level ITF events, but in the big WTA tournaments this spring at Indian Wells and Miami, she won just one match – against 221st-ranked Catherine McNally of Madeira.
In other words, until this week, her results have been typical of what you'd expect from even a great 15-year-old.
Corey Gauff argued in The Times that the age restriction, while well-intentioned, has in fact put too much pressure on his daughter to play well in those tournaments because she knows there are limited chances. He suggested the WTA should look at changing the rule from limiting the number of tournaments to total matches, which might have some merit.
"I think anytime a rule is 20-something years old, it needs to be looked at," he said.
But if Gauff is really destined to have a special career, it's wise to take a deep breath and let it happen slowly. The history of tennis tells us that with a talent like Gauff, trying to speed things up is the riskiest path of all.
Fifteen-year-old CoCo Gauff has captivated fans with her charge into the second week. She plays former No. 1 Simona Halep Monday.

Texto completo: –
Fear is your friend when the market seems low, but also when it is up, like now, and seems too high for so many people.
Fund managers of all types, for example, are at their most pessimistic since the financial crisis, a recent survey showed.
But as Warren Buffett famously preached: Be fearful when others are greedy – and greedy when others are fearful.
Such fear is ironic as stocks just hit all-time highs this week. That means the Bank of America’s fund manager survey is merely one sign of today’s rampant fear. And the American Association of Individual Investors’ weekly survey showed less than 30% of retail investors think stocks will rise over the next six months. At the same time, investor sentiment and economic confidence gauges across Europe are tanking. Headlines echo these fears, driving folks to yank money from stock mutual funds and ETFs in four of the prior six weeks through mid-June.
My married name is driving me crazy: Here's why.
Griller killers: America, you're grilling your burgers wrong
Sour sentiment is bullish. Why? Markets pre-price widely known information – fears, opinions, forecasts and more. When you see headlines warning of tariffs, Brexit, Iran, or Europe’s allegedly imploding economy, understand that stocks already considered them.
Anything less bad is a positive surprise, hence bullish. Consider this bull market’s March 2009 birth. Folks feared a new Great Depression. The recession we got was big and bad, but not that big. Stocks rose while the economy fell. U. S. stocks jumped 72. 3% in the bull’s first 12 months.
Consider today’s big fears like Iran’s threats to close the Strait of Hormuz and choke oil supply. Investors’ dread is priced in now. Anything tamer brings relief. Tamer is likely, because of ample global supply and the fact that Iran can’t really block the strait. Tankers have been attacked in years past, which wasn’t good – but it was no economic crisis either.
Apple says it doesn't track you: But apps on iPhone sure do
What about European economic fears? A slow-growing economy with weak manufacturing beats recession. Bullish!
How about Brexit? By now, any darned development on that front beats expectations. As for tariffs, have you noticed, as I predicted here last August in great detail, that tariffs only take a nibble from global output, rather than cause the much-feared recession? It's another pre-priced fear. Again, bullish.
I’ve often said bull markets end one of two ways: One, atop the legendary “wall of worry” as euphoria makes positive surprise essentially unattainable. Or the wallop – a multi-trillion dollar negative shock. The 2007-09 financial crisis was a wallop. But every other post-WWII bull market ended in euphoria. That matches Sir John Templeton’s legendary framework: “Bull markets are born on pessimism, grow on skepticism, mature on optimism and die on euphoria. ” Absent a wallop, bull markets end when investors tire of worrying.
We’re nowhere near that today. Stocks still have a big wall of worry to climb. At a true euphoric peak, sentiment surveys boast optimism. Money pours into stock mutual funds and ETFs. Headlines cite as many opportunities as risks. The investment world will ridicule the bears, not the bulls. You’ll fear missing gains more than fear suffering losses. If I write that bad times loom, you’ll call me crazy.
Sentiment isn’t a timing tool, of course. Euphoria is more like a dimmer switch than an on-off switch. To see euphoria correctly when it comes, you must think differently than others do. Instead of letting widespread fears send you scampering, envision what they say about sentiment broadly. When you see people excited to own stocks and dismissing risks, then start thinking about your exit.
Today, they do the opposite. Their fear is your future fortune.

Kamala Harris risks scorn of enviros for failing to craft climate plan

Texto completo: Despite having endorsed the Green New Deal, some activists say Democratic 2020 candidate Kamala Harris risks blunting her rise in the polls after a strong performance in the first Democratic debate if she doesn’t soon propose her own policies to combat climate change.
The California senator is surging but has failed to introduce a comprehensive plan to combat climate change like some of her competitors have, including former Vice President Joe Biden.
Climate change has matched or overtaken healthcare and jobs in some polls as a top issue for Democratic voters, sparking a competition among candidates to quickly release plans.
"Given her new prominence in the recent polling, it's time Sen. Harris put forward a clear and ambitious climate plan, or she may risk losing her credibility with party activists, younger voters and other key cohorts she'll need,” said Paul Bledsoe, a former Clinton White House climate adviser, now with the Progressive Policy Institute. “So far, she has avoided taking a clear position on almost every controversial climate policy issue.”
Along with Biden, candidates such Elizabeth Warren, Beto O’Rourke, and Jay Inslee have introduced detailed policy proposals, most of which share a broad goal of transitioning the U.S. away from fossil fuels to cleaner sources and creating jobs in green technology development while spending trillions on renewable energy.
Harris has sat out the early arms race so far, focusing on other issues such as equal pay and immigration. The Harris campaign did not respond to requests for comment asking about the status of her climate change plan. Harris also provided limited responses to climate policy surveys of the Democratic field conducted by the New York Times and Washington Post. She failed to respond to questions about her views on nuclear energy, carbon pricing, and banning fracking.
Nevertheless, she was the first candidate to proclaim support for the Green New Deal on the debate stage, deeming climate change a “crisis." She also scored a memorable moment when she warned President Trump’s skepticism of climate change science is a danger to the world.
Harris’ delay in releasing a plan could be strategic, and indicative of a thoughtful approach.
“It's surprising she doesn't have a plan out yet, but I have an impression it’s because her team is working on it,” said Leah Stokes, an assistant professor of environmental politics at the University of California at Santa Barbara. “I don’t give other candidates credit for speed. It's kind of like the tortoise and the hare.”
Other activists note prominent candidates such as Bernie Sanders, Cory Booker, and Kirsten Gillibrand have also not released climate change plans.
Candidates like Sanders and Harris with clearly defined economic equity and social justice-driven agendas face challenges about how to incorporate climate change policy.
"The problem we're finding is campaigns are not articulate enough yet on where they stand,” said a progressive climate policy advocate who advises campaigns, requesting anonymity to speak candidly. “There is also a political calculation of, ‘Do I know where I want to be, how does climate fit into my platform, and can I compete with the Jay Inslee's of the world who will always knock it out of the park?’”
Supporters, however, boast of Harris' environmental voting record in the Senate.
“She has a strong climate record and has been an environmental justice leader throughout her career,” said Matt McKnight of the League of Conservation Voters.
Harris holds a 100% rating from the League of Conservation Voters, a scorecard based on her Senate votes on environmental issues, most of which have been to oppose efforts to roll back Obama-era climate change rules.
This year, Harris introduced a bill with Sanders and Booker to provide grants to school districts replacing diesel school buses with electric ones. She co-sponsored another bill this year to prevent the Trump administration from opening the Arctic Ocean to oil and gas drilling.
Harris previously said she supports banning new fossil fuel leases on federal lands and waters. She has co-sponsored legislation to limit or repeal tax breaks to oil companies.
Supporters also admire her previous work as California’s attorney general challenging fossil fuel companies and say they could envision her using a presidential platform to pressure industry on climate change.
“Harris could be very excited to prosecute the case against the fossil fuel industry through the Department of Justice,” Stokes said.
Other activists want more.
“We want to see Sen. Harris center the climate emergency in her campaign for president,” said Garrett Blad, a spokesman for the Sunrise Movement, who nonetheless credited Harris with being a "consistent fighter for economic and environmental justice."Story URLPhoto Caption:Democratic presidential candidate Sen.

Captivity and injustice in 'A Human Being, Of a Sort'

Texto completo: WILLIAMSTOWN — At the start of Jonathan Payne's “A Human Being, Of a Sort," a half-naked black man stands in a cage, gripping its bars and gazing out at the audience. At the base of the cage are the words “Primate House."
It's hard to think of a more jolting or troubling image than that. While the dramatic tension of that silent tableau is not always maintained during the rest of the production, now at the Williamstown Theatre Festival under the direction of Whitney White, this is a play that gets under the skin.
The year is 1906, the place is the Bronx Zoo, and the diminutive man in the cage is an African from what was then called the Congo Free State, named Ota Benga. Payne's play was inspired by a real-life story: This obscene spectacle — the display of a human being as part of an exhibition on “the African Pygmy," for audiences to gawk at — actually occurred. Benga, a member of the Mbuti people, is superbly played by Antonio Michael Woodard, who got his MFA at Brown University and appeared in last year's Trinity Repertory Company production of “Ragtime." Woodard's portrayal of Benga is a skillful blend of sharply inscribed details that convey Benga's intelligence, defiance, wit, and desperation.
Guarding the cage, and increasingly troubled by his duties, is another black man: Fred Engelholm, nicknamed Smokey, who is played by the one and only André Braugher (“Brooklyn Nine-Nine," “Homicide: Life on the Streets," “Men of a Certain Age"). The bewhiskered Braugher delivers a penetrating characterization of Smokey that opens a window onto the guard's inner turmoil as he grapples with the dilemma of working within a system that has treated him unjustly.
Smokey has served three years on a prison farm for stealing two apples from a roadside vendor in Tennessee — a Jean Valjean-like sentence all out of proportion to the crime. If the guard assignment at the zoo goes well, Smokey will be granted his freedom; if not, it's back to the prison farm for him. That proposition becomes complicated, and creates tensions in the relationship between Benga and Smokey, when Benga asks the guard for the freedom to walk around the park.
Woodard and Braugher do a skillful, subtle job delineating the step-by-step construction of that relationship between two men who come to realize how much they have in common — and the multiple forms captivity can take in a society built on racial injustice. (Their shared plight invites us to ponder the high levels of black male incarceration that are of urgent concern today.) After witnessing Smokey's interactions with the white director of the zoo, William Temple Hornaday (Frank Wood), Benga tells the guard: “You become like me: Invisible." And, later: “They laugh at you like they laugh at me."
Alas, “A Human Being" goes slack whenever the focus shifts away from Smokey and Benga. As the insufferably smug and odious Hornaday, who asserts that Benga “is not our prisoner" but rather a “guest," the normally reliable Wood delivers a curiously passive performance, so his exchanges with Braugher's Smokey do not crackle with the necessary voltage.
Also lacking in electricity, mainly due to stilted dialogue, are the scenes involving three black clergymen (played by Sullivan Jones, Keith Randolph Smith, and Jeorge Bennett Watson) who confront Hornaday, intent on halting the exhibit, rescuing Benga from the zoo, and giving him a home and an education. The mayor of New York at that time refused to meet with the ministers, according to The New York Times, for which Hornaday lauded him, writing to him: “When the history of the Zoological Park is written, this incident will form its most amusing passage."
The contrast could not be clearer between a moral imbecile like Hornaday and the two men (Benga and Smokey) he subjects to humiliating treatment. Playwright Payne has crafted a finale that takes us back to the moment when Ota Benga's freedom was snatched from him. In real life, the end of his story came in 1916, a decade after the events depicted in “A Human Being, Of a Sort." That was when Benga, longing to return home to Africa but stymied from doing so, shot himself to death.
A HUMAN BEING, OF A SORT

Texto completo: United States The Cuyahoga River in Cleveland is thriving. Fifty years ago, a news photo of the river on fire sparked a nationwide conversation about how humans were hurting the environment. Since then, the river that once oozed has become a home for fish that are safe to eat. Cleanup efforts have also helped transform the state’s image: Ohio’s tourism bureau announced in March that for the past eight years, the state has had an annual increase of 550,000 visitors. (The New York Times)
Israel Israel has long helped other areas cope with drought through water technology innovations. By 2030, the United Nations predicts that half of the world’s population will face severe water shortages unless water consumption habits are radically changed. Israel already produces half of its water through desalination plants that pull water from the Mediterranean and make it potable for residential or commercial use. Almost all water is then recycled for agricultural use. California and India have been taking notes, and collaborations are underway. Experts say that fundamental changes in water consumption are still necessary regardless of these innovations, and the process for putting them into practice is lengthy. Proper storage of the salty byproduct of desalination known as brine has also been problematic. (Quartz)
Colombia This year, the Amazon rainforest in Colombia’s Magdalena Valley was added to the El Paujil reserve. Once rich in biodiversity, the area lost more than 90% of its original forest cover from deforestation. Habitats for endangered species were destroyed, but the reserve’s new protected status ensures habitat conservation and restoration. Other areas of the reserve have already seen resurgence of wildlife that had been considered eradicated, and conservationists hope the newly added Magdalena Valley will undergo similar renewal.

Germany Teenagers are teaching younger children how to be tech savvy. As the number of kids with smartphones increases, the need for digital literacy and online safety becomes more pressing. And since the digital age is just as new for adults as it is for children, German authorities decided to turn to older students for their experience. Peer-to-peer mentoring programs are now established in 11 out of 16 German states. Instead of schools banning cellphones entirely, teachers see the program as an effective way to address the unavoidable presence of them in students’ lives. (The Associated Press)
Africa The continent is leading the way with 34 national plastic bag bans. Since burning waste in Africa is common practice, toxic fumes emitted from burning plastic have become a problem. The United Nations reports that plastic bag bans are an effective way to reduce such pollution. The bag bans, along with bans on other nonbiodegradable plastics, have also helped African cities clear up often-clogged drainage systems, and a National Geographic reporter said that Kenya’s capital has become “visibly cleaner.” (National Geographic)

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
When a group of editors and reporters congregated for lunch last month in a conference room several floors above the Times newsroom, it was a bittersweet moment. It was an occasion to grant an award to a business journalist who exemplifies professional excellence and exceptional character. It was also a reminder of the shocking loss of someone with precisely those attributes.
The room in which we gathered is named for him: Nathaniel C. Nash.
Nathaniel joined the paper in 1973 as a recently minted Harvard graduate who had majored in languages. His path to the Times newsroom came from an unlikely turn. At a Bible study gathering he periodically attended when in New York, he encountered a Times reporter named McCandlish Phillips, who spoke of his work in journalism with such passion that Nathaniel came to feel the same calling.
After starting in clerical jobs, he worked as a copy editor, as a Washington reporter and as a correspondent in Latin America and Europe. "He was the happiest guy in the world when he became a reporter," said Soma Golden Behr, who worked closely with Nathaniel when she edited the Sunday Business section in the early 1980s. "He said, 'I can't believe they're paying me for what I'm doing.' He cared deeply, and boy, did he love it."
In Washington, he chronicled the regulatory and financial breakdown of the savings-and-loan industry. From postings abroad, his subjects ranged from the stolen children of Argentina's dirty war to the mysteries of Easter Island. He told how Romania aspired to winemaking prowess and how Claudia Schiffer (more adeptly) managed the riches of a supermodeling career.
He was nearly a quarter-century into his career -- "at the peak of his life," Ms. Golden Behr said -- when he was suddenly gone. He died in the crash of a United States military plane off Croatia in 1996 while covering a trade mission led by Commerce Secretary Ron Brown.
Nathaniel, a financial correspondent based in Frankfurt, was the only reporter on the trip, which he had persuaded his Times editors to let him cover. He was 44 years old, and he was the first Times journalist since World War II to die while covering a story.
Colleagues were devastated, but the blow was greatest to Nathaniel's family: his wife, Elizabeth, and their 8-year-son and 5-year-old twin daughters. In discussions between the family and Times journalists and executives, the idea emerged of establishing an annual award in Nathaniel's memory.
But while the award was intended to recognize "journalistic chops," the criterion "was not a standard like the best business story of the year," said John Geddes, who was then the business editor. It was meant to honor the singular qualities that defined Nathaniel: Someone who was "cooperative, collegial, who would help you out on anything."
"In such an ego-driven job," Mr. Geddes said, "he was selfless in a way that made you think it's a better place because he's here."
There have now been 21 recipients of the award "for coverage of business and economic news distinguished by its intelligence, curiosity and clarity," their names recorded on a plaque in the Times newsroom. Some have made their mark overseas, like David Barboza and Liz Alderman. Others have had stateside careers, like David Leonhardt and Patricia Cohen. This year, for the first time, the award was presented to someone while an editor: Adrienne Carter, a deputy business editor.
David Carr, a media reporter, was given the award in 2011. His career, too, was abruptly cut short when he died in 2015 at the age of 58.
Above the plaque listing recipients is one commemorating Nathaniel himself, describing him as "a journalist of spacious heart and gracious spirit who epitomized the correspondent's craft."
"It's always striking to me how much it means to The Times to honor the character of the people," Elizabeth Nash said of the award. "It's very much about someone who can collaborate, about the telling of the story -- not your own accomplishments -- and about someone who works well with others, who represents a fineness. It's very heartening." The annual award lunch has also been a way for her children, now young adults, to join in a celebration of their father's work and values.
Almost 30 years ago, when I was a Times editor visiting the Washington bureau and Nathaniel was a congressional reporter, he led me on a daylong tour of Capitol Hill. As the years go by, those receiving the award and attending the lunch are less likely to have known him. But his impact continues to be felt. "This man gave his life serving our readers," said Ellen Pollock, the current business editor. "That is very much top of mind."

The fever of resistance to Trump becomes threatening

Texto completo: The toxicity of the resistance to President Donald Trump has risen in recent days.
A justification for denying public accommodation came from The Washington Post in an op-ed by Stephanie Wilkinson, the owner of a farm-to-table restaurant in Lexington, Virginia. Wilkinson became famous last year when she refused to serve White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders and told Sanders and her family to leave the restaurant.
Wilkinson later told the press she ejected Sanders because the Trump administration is "inhumane and unethical" and because the Red Hen "has certain standards that I feel it has to uphold, such as honesty, and compassion and cooperation."
In her column, Wilkinson discussed the case of The Aviary, a trendy bar in Chicago where a waitress recently spat on Eric Trump, the president’s son. Wilkinson wrote that the incident, along with her own decision to oust Sanders, shows that in the age of Trump, "new rules apply" in public accommodations: Americans who work for the administration or support the president should stay away.
"If you’re directly complicit in spreading hate or perpetuating suffering, maybe you should consider dining at home," Wilkinson wrote.
Wilkinson noted that "no one in the industry condones the physical assault of a patron," but at the same time declared that Americans should understand that a "frustrated person" -- for example, a restaurant employee -- will "lash out at the representatives of an administration that has made its name trashing norms and breaking backs." Americans should accept that such things will happen.
An apology for doxxing came from The New York Times in a piece by Kate Cronin-Furman, an assistant professor of human rights at University College London. The article focused on the treatment of illegal immigrant children in detention centers near the U.S.-Mexico border.
Cronin-Furman discussed the detentions, as well as actions by employees of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, in terms of the Holocaust and genocides in Cambodia and Rwanda, contexts which most Americans would likely dismiss as preposterous.
Her idea is that opponents of the administration should publicly identify and shame low- and mid-level Customs and Border Protection employees who care for migrant children.
Such workers would be dismayed at being publicly shamed because they are "sensitive to social pressure," Cronin-Furman wrote, "which has been shown to have played a huge role in atrocity commission and resistance in the Holocaust, Rwanda and elsewhere. The campaign to stop the abuses at the border should exploit this sensitivity."
"This is not an argument for doxxing," Cronin-Furman continued. "It’s about exposure of their participation in atrocities to audiences whose opinion they care about. The knowledge, for instance, that when you go to church on Sunday, your entire congregation will have seen you on TV ripping a child out of her father’s arms is a serious social cost to bear."
Needless to say, that was a clear argument for doxxing.
Finally, there was Antifa’s recent attack on Andy Ngo, a freelance journalist often associated with the pro-free thought cultural publication Quillette. At a demonstration in Portland, Oregon, Antifa fighters beat up and milkshaked Ngo, apparently because he was there and he was not on their side.
The president is not always at the center of such demonstrations, but Antifa has become an angry and violent fringe force in the Resistance. It has played an ugly role in a number of events, most notably Charlottesville.
Shunning, shaming, doxxing, attacking. As the 2020 campaign reaches full speed, would it surprise anyone to see all of it increase? And all from people who congratulate themselves for standing against hate. Perhaps our politics will cool down at some point in the future. But not now.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has raised $ 21.5 million since entering the presidential race in late April, his campaign said Wednesday.
Mr. Biden's haul for the second quarter of the year cements his status as one of the financial heavyweights among the two dozen Democratic presidential contenders. But it fell short of what Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., collected in the quarter, which ran from April through June.
While Mr. Biden did not announce his candidacy until several weeks into the quarter, he also had the advantage of beginning his campaign as a household name who had spent eight years as vice president and decades as a senator.
Mr. Buttigieg, who at the start of the year was little known outside of Indiana, raised $ 24.8 million in the quarter, his campaign said this week. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who was also a candidate for the full quarter, collected $ 18 million, his campaign said.

The presidential campaign of Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado also disclosed its fund-raising on Wednesday. It said Mr. Bennet had raised $ 2.8 million since he entered the race in early May, a total that underscores the steep financial challenge facing some of the lesser-known candidates in the large Democratic field.
Presidential candidates are due to report their second-quarter fund-raising to the Federal Election Commission by July 15. Fund-raising totals hardly assure success at the ballot box -- for all his financial might, Mr. Buttigieg remains in single digits in national polling -- but they can be an indicator of which candidates are gaining steam and which are struggling to attract interest. The forthcoming reports will also offer details on how campaigns are spending their money.
In the quarter, Mr. Biden received more than 436,000 donations from more than 256,000 donors, his campaign said. The average donation was $ 49, according to his team. His campaign did not say how much cash it had on hand at the end of the quarter.
By comparison, Mr. Sanders's campaign, which is not holding high-dollar fund-raisers, collected less money than Mr. Biden in the quarter, but received a much larger number of donations -- nearly one million, according to the campaign. The Sanders campaign said its average donation in the quarter was $ 18.
In announcing its fund-raising total, the Biden campaign emphasized how much it had raised per day that Mr. Biden was in the race, a statistic that puts him above Mr. Buttigieg for the quarter. "We've raised more per day than any other presidential campaign," Mr. Biden's team wrote in an email to supporters, with the subject line "INCREDIBLE milestone."
The fund-raising haul was announced hours before Mr. Biden and his wife, Jill, kicked off a swing through Iowa, where they will be spending the Fourth of July holiday campaigning.
Mr. Biden has been the clear leader in early national polling, though he has slid somewhat in recent surveys. At the same time, Senator Kamala Harris of California has found momentum after last Thursday's debate, at which she confronted Mr. Biden over his comments about segregationist senators and his record on school busing. Ms. Harris, who raised more money than anyone aside from Mr. Sanders in the first quarter of the year, has not yet revealed her fund-raising total for the second quarter, but she is expected to disclose a sizable number as well.
[We tracked down the 2020 Democrats and asked them the same set of questions. Watch them answer.]
Mr. Biden does not appear to be slowing his high-dollar fund-raising pace this month, with finance events scheduled for New York and Los Angeles in coming weeks, according to invitations reviewed by The New York Times.
Mr. Biden has devoted considerable time to high-dollar fund-raisers since joining the race, allowing him to scoop up huge amounts of campaign cash. But his time on the fund-raising circuit also carries the risk that he will be perceived as focused on wealthy donors at a time when small online donations are coveted by Democratic campaigns.
Mr. Sanders's campaign, in particular, has sought to highlight how Mr. Biden is raising money.
"Here's the truth: Joe Biden is traveling around the country raising a lot of money for his campaign at fund-raising events with billionaires, corporate lobbyists and Wall Street executives," Mr. Sanders's campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, wrote in an email seeking donations last month. "And we can't afford to fall too far behind."
It was at a fund-raiser in New York last month that Mr. Biden cited two segregationist senators as he recalled a time of "civility" in the Senate, remarks that have drawn criticism and put a spotlight on his opposition to school busing early in his Senate career. (Mr. Biden allows reporters into all of his fund-raisers, unlike other major Democratic candidates who are holding high-dollar events.)
Mr. Biden had been expected to post a big number for the second quarter. His campaign said it brought in $ 6.3 million in the 24 hours after Mr. Biden entered the race on April 25, more than any other campaign had disclosed raising in its first day.

New look of July 4 in Washington both dismays and delights

Texto completo: Joe and Lisa Scott, from Satellite Beach, Fla., did not plan their trip to the District specifically for the Fourth of July but decided that the celebration would be a nice addition to their vacation.
"That was until the whole Trump fiasco," Joe Scott said.
For the past few weeks, the couple had been following the news about President Trump's "Salute to America," which is expected to include a military aircraft flyover, a display of two M1A2 Abrams battle tanks and other military vehicles on the Mall, a speech by the president and two fireworks displays.
Joe Scott, 64, said he did not "appreciate the militarization of it all," and Lisa Scott was beginning to think Code Pink's plan to protest the events sounded appealing. As of Wednesday, the couple had not decided whether they would attend the festivities.
But C.J. Carwell, a store manager at the Claire's jewelry shop at Tysons Corner Center, was visibly excited to learn about Trump's plans. Carwell, whose father, uncles and brother have served in the military, said she grew up around symbols of the armed forces.
"Oh, I think people will enjoy [the tanks]," she said. "They're big, they're exciting. And seeing something that's never been done? That'll be interesting."
Carwell lives in Northern Virginia and will celebrate July 4 in her own neighborhood. Though she said she's not a supporter of the president, she plans to watch the events at the Mall on television.
On the eve of Independence Day, as Bradley Fighting Vehicles were on display near the Lincoln Memorial, residents and visitors to the D.C. area had mixed reactions about the revamped festivities. Some criticized what they said was the politicization of a national holiday, citing the president's speech and the $2.5 million the National Park Service will spend on the event. Others think the additional events are a good idea. And despite all the media coverage and criticism, many were not even aware of the changes.
Andre and Susan Weiglein are from a suburb of San Francisco, but both grew up in the D.C. area. Along with their two sons, they planned to spend July 4 in the District. Andre Weiglein, 54, said he had not heard much about what Trump has planned for the day, but he thinks the concept is great.
"I want my kids to see the fireworks I grew up seeing," Susan Weiglein, 52, said.
For most residents, Trump's plans will not affect their celebrations. They will still eat hot dogs and hamburgers at family barbecues. They will still go to friends' pools to cool off on a day that promises temperatures in the low 90s. And many will attend fireworks displays in the suburbs.
At Tysons Corner, various mall-dwellers on Wednesday morning said they had not heard about the changes to the celebration in the District.
Jim Reichert, 76, was one of few who had.
"It stinks," the retiree said, setting down his copy of the New York Times in a booth outside the AMC theater. Reichert, who has lived in Northwest since 1972, said he was "shocked" when he learned about the president's plan to display tanks on the Mall. He said he has occasionally visited the Mall on July 4 but does not plan to do so this year.
"Bringing the military into what's traditionally been a very peaceful celebration. . . . It has overtones of authoritarian governments, like North Korea or the Soviet Union," the former accountant said.
Sabari Cetin, 57, also disapproves of the expanded military presence in the Independence Day celebrations. The engineer, who is visiting from Chicago, said he was reconsidering his plans to spend Thursday evening at the Capitol watching the National Symphony Orchestra.
"Tanks rolling through, I mean, oh my God. That's not America," said Cetin, who immigrated from Turkey to the United States in 1984. Rocking his crying toddler on his hip, Cetin added that he did not want his 1 ½-year-old son exposed to "military displays of things."
For the past five years, Judi Lambart has celebrated the Fourth in different ways. Some years, she's walked down to the Mall. Other years, she's watched the fireworks from her home.
This year, she said, she's getting out of town.
Lambart, 66, is heading to Michigan, where she is from originally, to spend time with her family. Sitting near the fountain at Dupont Circle on Wednesday, she tried to think of a nice word to describe the changes in the nation's celebration.
She said she couldn't.
The fireworks and festivities have always been fantastic, Lambart said. They couldn't be better.
"I don't see why someone feels the need to trump that," she said.

Texto completo: We live in an era of public ugliness, of architects who deliberately make their forms unsightly and inhuman, and of public art installations that are invariably ridiculous.
The most obvious exception is the ballpark, which has gotten more beautiful rather than less in a great example of renewal through a return to tradition.
Paul Goldberger, a former architecture writer for The New York Times, traces this journey in his wonderful new book "Ballpark."
He rightly calls the ballpark "one of the greatest of all American building types" and argues that "as much as the town square, the street, the park, and the plaza, the baseball park is a key part of American public space."
Ballparks went from delightfully peculiar structures shoehorned into city streets, to monochromatic multiuse facilities with all the charm of public-works projects, before rediscovering the old forms.
The first ballpark was built in Brooklyn in 1862 and called "Union Grounds." Amazingly enough, "The Star-Spangled Banner," not yet the national anthem, was played before the first game. The wooden parks of the 19th century tended to burn down, sometimes spectacularly (a fire at the South End Grounds in Boston took out 200 buildings in Roxbury).
The 20th century brought the age of steel, brick and concrete, and "the Golden Age" of 1912-14. It gave us Crosley Field, where the Reds played until 1970, with an upward slope known as the "terrace" in left field; Tiger Stadium, quirky and cozy (a flagpole stood in the field of play in deep center); and especially the "jewel boxes" of Fenway, Wrigley and Ebbets.
They had in common eccentricities owing to where they were built, and an extraordinary intimacy. Some of their signature features didn't come until later. The famous Green Monster and the "Dartmouth Green" paint of the interior of Fenway arrived with renovations. Wrigley didn't get its iconic ivy walls until the 1930s.
Subsequent decades brought a flight from cities, and from idiosyncrasy. Cleveland previewed what was to come in the 1930s with its publicly funded, gargantuan, usually half-empty, symmetrical, multisport Municipal Stadium, or the "Mistake by the Lake."
The truly dreadful, indistinguishable concrete doughnuts, made for football and baseball but manifestly unsuited for the latter, arrived beginning in the 1960s.
The turning point was Camden Yards in Baltimore, opened in 1992. Originally conceived as another multisport suburban facility, it instead decisively moved baseball beyond such hybrids. A decision at the outset to keep a nostalgic-feeling old Baltimore & Ohio Railroad red-brick warehouse intact at the site of the new park usefully pointed to the past.
Camden Yards has a red-brick exterior and exposed steel supports inside, eschewing the concrete of the doughnuts. It limits foul territory to bring ground-level seats closer. The stands are arranged asymmetrically to avoid a deadening sameness, and frame a view of the Baltimore skyline, anchoring the park in the city.
It was such a triumph that its retro style has become a design cliche. Its influence stamped the best of the new parks: PNC Park in Pittsburgh, which, outside of Fenway and Wrigley, might be the most charming place to watch a game in the country; Oracle Park in San Francisco, which is everything its execrable forebear, Candlestick, wasn't; T-Mobile Park in Seattle, which is enchanting despite a retractable roof.
They all are distinctive and tethered to a specific city. They are all pleasing and humane, as good architecture always is. And they are wholly devoted to baseball -- still and all, the most American game.
Goldberger writes of how the ballpark, with its lush field at the center of an enclosure of concrete and steel, is the garden in the city, a sports combination of the Jeffersonian agrarian tradition and the Hamiltonian emphasis on cities and industry.
It's a wonder we managed to mess it up, but we did, before the current revival that shows there's always a way back.

THREAT THAT CANCELED READINGS NOT NEW TO DRAG QUEEN COMMUNITY

Texto completo: It didn't surprise drag queens Akasha L Van-Cartier and Ona Louis that a threat on social media forced the Carnegie Library in Oakland and the Children's Museum of Pittsburgh to cancel their "Drag Queen Story Hour" programs this past Friday and Saturday.
"Being queer . you get hate every day," said Jonathan Hamilt, whose drag name is Ona Louise and who is co-founder of the national "Drag Queen Story Hour" program. "This is nothing new."
Akasha, a local drag queen and regular participant in Pittsburgh's story hours whose real name is Michael King, agreed. "I've seen a lot of my sisters suffer," she said, but added that the cancellations still upset her. Mr. Hamilt shared her feelings.
"It was really unfortunate," he said, noting that the readings were half the reason he came to Pittsburgh. A New York resident in town for the 2019 Children's Institute conference, Mr. Hamilt was scheduled to read at the Children's Museum and the Oakland library before their story hour events were canceled. Instead, Mr. Hamilt participated in Shadyside's celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots in New York City and "Drag Queen Story Hour" at the Andy Warhol Museum.
He borrowed the concept from the program's founder, Michelle Tea, who started it in San Francisco in 2014. With her blessing, he brought the program to New York in 2016 and began expanding it to include 43 nationwide chapters. The Carnegie Library has been hosting "Drag Queen Story Hour" since 2017. It has not received any direct threats, according to Suzanne Thinnes, the communications manager at the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, but anti-drag commentary that appeared on the social media site Reddit was "alarming enough" to take action.
"I totally get why they canceled," Mr. Hamilt said. "Having a safe and secure reading is always our goal."
Ms. Thinnes said library officials contacted Pittsburgh police about the threat. Police officials could not be reached for comment Monday.
Pittsburgh is not the only place where the story hour has faced pushback recently.
The Washington Post reported that in Leander, Texas, in late May, city officials canceled a drag queen story hour at a library. But an LGBT-friendly church, Open Cathedral, stepped in to host it.
And in Ohio in early June, Republican state House Speaker Larry Householder condemned drag queen story time in a letter to the Ohio Library Council. He called the events "a stunningly bizarre breach of the public trust," according to The New York Times.
Two libraries in central Ohio then canceled drag story times after receiving what the library council said were "hostile threats." The Ohio Library Council issued a statement supporting events like drag queen story time.
While Ms. Thinnes said it's library protocol for extra security to be present at the drag queen story hours, it seemed safer to cancel the event.
"It's really scary to think that people would threaten my life for educating a child," said Akasha, praising the program's lessons on tolerance and acceptance. "It's 2019. There are all types of people . and all of their differences have to be recognized."
Akasha said she wishes that "Drag Queen Story Hour" would have existed when she was growing up.
"The program itself has great messaging," Ms. Thinnes agreed, noting that it promotes literacy, kindness and understanding. "It's wildly, wildly popular," she added. "Children and families love it."
The library's "Drag Queen Story Hour" had already planned to end for the summer but will return next season, Ms. Thinnes said.
"We have every intention of continuing 'Drag Queen Story Hour,'" she said, despite a separate online petition with 16,000 signatures organized by an anti-LGBT group urging the Carnegie Library to cancel the program.
Akasha said she will remain part of it: "I won't back down to hatred and fear."
Neither, it seems, will Mr. Hamilt. "Drag Queen Story Hour" is working with the American Civil Liberties Union to formulate policies on online trolling and digital hate speech, he said.
"It's scary, but at the same time, out of fear comes change," Akasha said.

Split Emerges in Administration Over Approach to North Korea Talks

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- As President Trump reveled in his historic weekend stroll into North Korea, administration officials were sharply at odds on Monday over what demands to make of Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, while preparing to restart negotiations on a nuclear deal.
Pushing an internal debate into the open, John R. Bolton, the national security adviser and the most prominent hawk in the administration, reacted angrily to a report in The New York Times about the possibility of a deal to effectively freeze North Korea's nuclear activity in return for American concessions.
Some officials are considering a freeze as a first step toward a more comprehensive agreement for Mr. Kim to give up his entire nuclear program. Mr. Bolton has long insisted that the North Koreans dismantle their nuclear program and give up their entire arsenal of warheads before getting any rewards.
"This was a reprehensible attempt by someone to box in the president," Mr. Bolton wrote on Twitter. "There should be consequences."
But some senior administration officials have been discussing the idea of an incremental approach under which North Korea would first close down its nuclear facilities to prevent it from making new fissile material, in effect freezing its program but leaving its existing arsenal in place.
In exchange, the Americans would make some concessions that would help improve the living conditions in North Korea, which is under heavy sanctions, or strengthen relations between Washington and Pyongyang.
Among those considering such ideas are senior diplomats, say people familiar with the discussions.
Mr. Trump, eager to burnish his self-constructed image as a dealmaker in the run-up to the 2020 presidential election, appears open to embracing a step-by-step process. Mr. Trump did not publicly mention full denuclearization during his hour at the border between the two Koreas on Sunday or after talks with South Korean leaders.
In April, during a visit to the White House by President Moon Jae-in of South Korea, Mr. Trump signaled that gradual concessions by both sides might be necessary.
"There are various smaller deals that could happen," he said. "You could work out step-by-step pieces, but at this moment, we're talking about the big deal. The big deal is we have to get rid of nuclear weapons."
American officials involved in North Korea policy assert, even in private, that the administration's long-run goal has been consistent all along: to have Mr. Kim, with whom Mr. Trump met at the border on Sunday, give up all of his nuclear weapons and the ability to build more.
In the short run, Mr. Trump's public comments -- and the showmanship of going to the Demilitarized Zone and stepping over a low concrete barrier to walk with Mr. Kim on his soil -- is another sign of the limited influence of Mr. Trump's most hard-line advisers. Mr. Bolton was not at the meeting in North Korea but on a scheduled trip to Mongolia. Last month, Mr. Trump at the last minute rejected Mr. Bolton's urging for a military strike on Iran.
On Monday, after Mr. Bolton made his statement, Mr. Trump spoke effusively on Twitter about his weekend trip to the Koreas without disputing the possibility of a step-by-step approach. "While there, it was great to call on Chairman Kim of North Korea to have our very well covered meeting," he tweeted. "Good things can happen for all!"
Mr. Trump has given Secretary of State Mike Pompeo responsibility for restarting negotiations, which had stalled after a failed February summit in Hanoi, Vietnam, between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim.
It was the second time the two had met, and Mr. Trump at the time had insisted that Mr. Kim give up his entire nuclear program, including an estimated 30 to 60 warheads, in exchange for sanctions relief.
Mr. Bolton and Mr. Pompeo had both urged the president to settle for nothing less than a grand deal, but Mr. Pompeo now appears open to considering a gradual approach.
The State Department declined to comment on Monday. On Sunday night, Stephen E. Biegun, the United States' special representative for North Korea, told The Times that its account of the ideas being discussed in the administration were "pure speculation" and that his team was "not preparing any new proposal currently."
Some analysts said any approach must start with the United States and North Korea committing to a common definition of denuclearization. Without an ironclad definition, there is greater risk the North Koreans could back out of an interim deal, as they have done under previous American administrations, they said.
"There's a myriad of ways that North Korea can pull it back," said Jung H. Pak, a former C.I.A. analyst who is now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.
For months after the meeting in Hanoi, there was no senior-level contact between Washington and Pyongyang, then Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim exchanged letters.
That paved the way for Mr. Trump's Twitter post from the G20 summit in Japan on Saturday, in which he said he would like to see Mr. Kim during a scheduled visit Sunday to the Demilitarized Zone, on the border between the two Koreas, to shake Mr. Kim's hand and to "say Hello(?)!"
Mr. Pompeo and other officials scrambled to organize for a potential meeting. Mr. Trump asked Mr. Pompeo to accompany him to the heavily guarded border village of Panmunjom, along with Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, his eldest daughter and his son-in-law. Mr. Bolton notably flew to Mongolia instead. "Delighted to be in Ulaanbaatar," he said on Twitter above a photograph of him smiling with the country's secretary of state, Davaasuren Damdinsuren.
Though Mr. Pompeo is often aligned with Mr. Bolton on an aggressive approach to national security issues -- Mr. Pompeo has also advocated a strike on Iran -- the secretary of state is acutely attuned to Mr. Trump's desires and has tried diplomacy with the North Koreans when commanded by the president.
In interviews and talks in recent weeks, Mr. Pompeo has not mentioned his earlier insistence that North Koreans must first turn over a complete list of nuclear assets, which some experts say is a necessary first step to establishing baselines for full denuclearization.
Administration officials say Mr. Biegun has been trying to come up with creative ways to get North Korea to at least agree with the Americans on a common definition of denuclearization and to start the process of shutting down its program. American intelligence officials have assessed that Mr. Kim will probably never give up all of his nuclear weapons.
That is where serious consideration of a step-by-step process comes in.
In January, during a speech at Stanford University, Mr. Biegun signaled that American negotiators might be willing to push off the demand for an inventory of nuclear assets and engage in a more gradual process. "Sequencing always confounds negotiators," he said.
Mr. Trump's grand-deal gambit in Hanoi upended that thinking. But that summit's failure has left the door open for other ideas. Negotiators are back at a new starting line, essentially the same place they were after Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim's first summit, held in Singapore in June 2018.
Doing a yearslong gradual process with a freeze on activity as the initial goal would amount to tacit acceptance of North Korea as a nuclear state. But American officials in both the White House and State Department say sanctions would not be lifted until North Korea completely gets rid of its nuclear weapons and its program. That includes the five sets of sanctions imposed by the Obama and Trump administrations starting in 2016 that North Korean officials say they most want the United States to cancel. In Hanoi, Mr. Kim made this demand of Mr. Trump.
For now, American officials might consider allowing more robust humanitarian aid to enter North Korea or some limited economic exchanges between the North and South, which under Mr. Moon has been pushing forward on an inter-Korean peace process. The two sides could also open interests offices in each other's capitals.
In the approaches under consideration, those concessions would happen only if North Korea agrees to halt all its uranium enrichment -- not only at Yongbyon, the central site of its nuclear program, but also at Kangson, another site known to American officials.
American intelligence officials also suspect there may be a third site, say experts on North Korea's nuclear program.

Texto completo: Within hours after an anti-Trump cartoon proved popular on social media, its creator, Michael de Adder, was released from his freelance contract with a Canadian newspaper group.
The timing of the news - which de Adder shared on his Facebook and Twitter accounts over the weekend - raised eyebrows within the editorial cartooning community. But Brunswick News said Sunday in a statement that its cancellation of de Adder's contract was not because of the President Trump cartoon, but rather follows weeks of "negotiations" over bringing back another cartoonist, "reader favourite" Greg Perry.
"It is entirely incorrect" to attribute the decision to de Adder's viral immigration cartoon, said Brunswick News, calling that a "false narrative" that spread "carelessly and recklessly on social media."
In the cartoon, which de Adder tweeted last Wednesday, Trump has pulled his golf cart up to two drowned bodies and asks, "Do you mind if I play through?" His image references the widely circulated photo of father Óscar Alberto Martínez Ramírez and daughter Angie Valeria, who died crossing the Rio Grande from Mexico to Texas. The cartoon gained popularity after such celebrities as George Takei and Mark Hamill noted it on social media.
De Adder told The Washington Post in an interview Monday that he received a call from his editor late last week to inform the cartoonist that his contract had been canceled. He said that he was not given a reason for the cancellation and that he doesn't believe it was a coincidence.
"I was in the middle of a supernova moment and it lasted till the next morning," de Adder said of the span between the cartoon going viral and his contract being ended. "It was the highest of highs for 24 hours and then I get a phone call: 'I'm sorry, we're letting you go.' "
"I had a good relationship with my editors just four days previous," de Adder said. "I had supplied my cartoons and there were no issues. I replaced [spiked] cartoons whenever they wanted. . . . So what normal human being wouldn't think [the timing] was more than a coincidence?"
Wes Tyrell, president of the Association of Canadian Cartoonists, also told The Post on Sunday that the timing seemed intentional. "He's done hundreds of Trump cartoons," Tyrell said, "but none has run in these [Brunswick] papers" that represent de Adder's home province, where he still has family, the cartoonist tweeted.
"The only subject I was told that was taboo was Trump," de Adder told The Post, in characterizing his working relationship with Brunswick News editors.
De Adder, who is based in Halifax and grew up in New Brunswick, announced Brunswick News's decision on Twitter on Friday. The company noted in its statement that it was "not even offered" the immigration cartoon.
De Adder's work prominently appears in Toronto and Halifax newspapers, Tyrell noted. His freelance cartoons will stop appearing in several key papers owned by Brunswick News, to which he had contributed for 17 years.
His long history with the company is one of the reasons de Adder said he is confused by the company's decision. The publisher made de Adder its primary cartoonist last year, he said, and "in the 17 years I worked at Brunswick News, there was never a day that my cartoon didn't appear in one of its papers."
News of de Adder's canceled contract comes shortly after the New York Times ended its contracts with two political cartoonists, including longtime contributor Patrick Chappatte, whose work appeared in the Times's international edition. The Times's announcement followed controversy and an apology from the publisher for an overseas cartoon mocking Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Last year, Rob Rogers was fired from the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette after a quarter-century at the paper, after editors killed at least 18 of his cartoons and cartoon ideas. All the spiked work was critical of Trump or issues closely connected to his administration.
In April, Rogers was a Pulitzer Prize finalist for editorial cartooning.
De Adder says he will continue working for newspapers in Halifax and Ottawa, as well as the American cartoon outlet Counterpoint, recently created by Rogers, former Houston Chronicle cartoonist Nick Anderson and the Economist/Baltimore Sun cartoonist Kal Kallaugher.
And will he continue creating cartoons that are critical of Trump?
"I'm working on one now," de Adder said.

Texto completo: Reviewing Emilie Pine's "Notes to Self" in The Irish Times, Martina Evans wrote: "It's the kind of book you want to give to everyone, especially young women and men, so that we can learn together to take ourselves and each other more seriously."
A lot of readers must have taken her advice, because the essay collection became the No. 1 best-selling book in Ireland, where Pine is an associate professor of modern drama at University College Dublin. Pine had written academic books before, but the subject matter and the perspective in "Notes to Self" were a radical departure. She writes in these six essays about the effect of her father's alcoholism on her family, her unsuccessful attempts to have a baby, menstruation, body image and sexual violence. Her tone is both frank and measured, confessional and confidently self-contained. Below, Pine talks about the "volcanic pressure" she felt to write these things, her surprising connections with readers and more.
When did you first get the idea to write this book?
My father, who had been an alcoholic all my life, went into liver failure in 2013. He was in intensive care and spent a year in and out of the hospital. In 2014, when it became apparent he was actually going to live, I still had a lot of crazy emotions going around in my head, so I wrote them down, just in a journal to myself. My partner found it and said, "There's something here." It took me two years to get up the courage to send it to a publisher in Ireland, and they commissioned a book out of it. There was this moment when they asked if I could write a book, and I simultaneously thought: Yes and no.
But I was being given this incredible permission. And I was being told I had a style and a voice, words I would never have used about myself. On the bus on the way home from that meeting, I wrote down five ideas on the back of my bus ticket -- that's part of the joke of the title, I write on every scrap of paper available -- and those five ideas became the five other essays, and I didn't really deviate from that.
Looking back, I can see that there was a volcanic pressure for these things to come out of me. But there was a social silence as well as a personal silence. I wrote it quickly, over the course of a year. Or you could say it took me 40 years to write it.
What's the most surprising thing you learned while writing it?
I didn't tell people about the book until after it was done, and that was important to me, to have this privacy to write it in. I told a friend when I finished, and she said, "You're the last person I ever thought would write something like this." I was surprised she had noticed that. I'm a very talkative person, but you can talk a lot and be very quiet at the same time. She was so observant to notice how reticent I am about family and personal issues, though I'll talk about politics endlessly.
The real surprise has been after publication. It's become something of a phenomenon here. I was a little afraid of whether people would judge me, and it's been completely the opposite. The meaningful part is that so many people get in touch and tell me their stories, either in person or by email or social media. I never anticipated the generosity with which people share in return. I had to learn how to deal with the responsibility of it; I'm not a counselor. So rather than feeling it as responsibility, you feel a kind of solidarity. That's how I've come to think of it.
In what way is the book you wrote different from the book you set out to write?
Because I'm an academic, I assumed it would be much more a polemic about the state of the world. It might start with me, but then it would generalize to talk about addiction issues or sexual violence against women, with statistics and so on. It refused to do that. It insisted on being a personal story. I kept being irritated with myself for not being able to write the polemic I wanted. But it kept feeling really fake. I wanted to write an authentic book, though I would have never used that phrase in the beginning of the process.
I kept having to ask myself: What is it that I really want to say? What is the story burning inside me? I thought: I could be a first-rate Emilie Pine or a third-rate Rebecca Solnit. So I chose to be myself.
Who is a creative person (not a writer) who has influenced you and your work?
Patty Griffin, the American singer and songwriter. I liked her music before I knew who she was, because I listen to the Dixie Chicks and she had written a song for them. But she has a song, "Truth #2," that talks about how we stay silent about difficult emotions. It has a lyric: "I'm just so scared all the time / makes me one more reason why the world is dangerous." That is something that I think of over and over again, a kind of mantra about why self-revelation is actually a political gesture. If we hide ourselves, then we're making it harder for everyone else around us, not easier. That instinct to hide in order to protect other people or ourselves is actually contributing to the problem. She's just an incredible musician, and I love seeing her live.
Persuade someone to read "Notes to Self" in 50 words or less.
I was done with all the silences around women's lives and bodies, so I wrote the book that I wanted -- that I needed -- to read. It was my way of processing, and possessing, the hardest parts of my life; it was my way of making something joyful out of pain.

Texto completo: OSAKA, Japan - For more than two years, friends and foes alike have pushed President Donald Trump to tell President Vladimir Putin of Russia not to interfere in American democracy. As the two leaders sat side by side on Friday for their first formal meeting in a. year, Trump obliged - but in his own distinctive way.
The topic did not come up in either man's opening remarks, which in Trump's case were filled with flowery talk about their relationship. Only when a reporter shouted out a question, asking Trump if he would tell Russia not to meddle in American elections, did the president respond, and then by making light of the matter.
"Yes, of course I will," Trump said.
Turning to Putin, he said, with a slight grin on his face and an almost joking tone in his voice, "Don't meddle in the election, President."
As Putin also smiled, Trump pointed at another Russian official in a playful way and repeated, "Don't meddle in the election."
Once again, Trump made clear that he did not take the issue as seriously as Democrats and many Republicans back home do. And once again, he refused to publicly cross Putin with so much as a word of disagreement, much less reproach.
In doing so, he risked another domestic political backlash like the one he endured after the leaders' last official meeting in Helsinki, Finland, when Trump, standing at Putin's side, challenged the conclusion of his own intelligence agencies about the Russian election operation and credited the Kremlin leader's "extremely strong and powerful" denial.
In the interim, the special counsel, Robert Mueller, issued his report concluding that Russia mounted a "sweeping and systematic" operation to influence the last presidential election on Trump's behalf, and he made a public plea to American leaders to pay attention to the threat. While he established no criminal conspiracy between Trump's campaign and Russia, Mueller documented extensive contacts between the two sides and noted that they shared the same goal in 2016.
Undaunted, Trump has interpreted Mueller's report to mean there was "no collusion." In several recent instances, he even insisted that the special counsel's investigation found that his campaign had "rebuffed" the Russians, which in the main it did not.
The president stirred outrage even among Republicans by saying "I'd take it" if Russia again offered incriminating information about an election opponent, and he scoffed at the idea of calling the FBI about such an approach, before switching gears and saying that he would inform the authorities.
Trump sees the relentless talk about the 2016 campaign as an unfair, partisan scheme to undermine his legitimacy, and he argues that, regardless of what happened three years ago, it is in the interest of the United States to have a more productive, less hostile relationship with Moscow.
Trump's encounter with Putin in Osaka, Japan, at the annual Group of 20 summit meeting, was his first opportunity to recalibrate the relationship. The two seemed in good spirits, strolling into the summit photo session together, their arms nearly touching as they chatted amiably.
During their later meeting, they shook hands, smiled and seemed to joke about the pulsing throng of journalists who were allowed in the room for less than five minutes.
"It's a great honor to be with President Putin," Trump said. "We've had great meetings," he added. "We have had a very, very good relationship. And we look forward to spending some pretty good time together. A lot of very positive things going to come out of the relationship."
Putin was friendly but more restrained in his comments, saying that they would discuss trade, disarmament and other issues. "All this will be built on a very good relationship that will be between us," he said. "I think that the results of this meeting will be excellent." Trump likewise said he wanted to discuss arms control and trade.
The written summary of the leaders' meeting issued by the White House indicated, without elaborating, that they had talked about that as well as Iran, Syria, Venezuela and Ukraine. The summary made no mention of election interference, nor did it say anything about two Americans who have been arrested by Russian authorities on disputed charges.

Study: Opioids crisis leads to job automation

Texto completo: CHAPEL HILL, N.C. - The nation's opioid epidemic triggered a drop in the number of people able to work, hurting companies' ability to grow and leading to an increased investment in technologies to replace those workers, a new study from UNC-Chapel Hill's Kenan-Flagler Business School found.
The study says opioids "effectively make labor costlier" in some communities by shrinking the number of applicants available for jobs. That negatively affects company growth in areas heavily impacted by opioid addiction.
The study also shows that in areas with high levels of opioid abuse, companies have made more investments into technology and automation, which could cause "permanent negative effects on local labor markets."
The effects were most significant in states with higher levels of opioid prescriptions.
"The substitution away from labor to capital has implications for communities," said Elena Simintzi, an assistant professor of finance at Kenan-Flagler and a co-author of the study.
"Blue-collar workers who are middle-aged are more likely to get addicted, and these are the types of jobs that get subbed away with technology. That has a lasting effect in a community."
She added that many of these employees will then need to be retrained or take jobs in the service economy, which often pays less than traditional manufacturing.
This isn't the first study to tie opioid addition to labor participation rates.
The late Alan Krueger, a Princeton economist, wrote a paper that said opioids could account for "about 43% of the observed decline in men's labor force participation." Former Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen also suggested a link during her time at the Fed.
But UNC says this is the first study that looks at the impact on the companies that employ those workers.
In areas that had high levels of addiction, the study found a "negative and significant" relationship between opioids and the growth of companies there. In contrast, in states where levels of addiction were lower, the study didn't find a significant relationship between opioids and firm growth.
Simintzi said this especially hurt companies that employ low-skill manufacturing workers, as low educated workers and those who are at risk for injury on the job are more likely to become addicted to opioids. These companies are often competing with other firms in countries like China or Europe that don't have face these addiction issues, putting them at a disadvantage, she added.
The study uses a New York Times story about a Youngstown, Ohio-based boiler maker as an anecdote for this phenomenon.
That company misses out on about $200,000 worth of orders ever year because of a lack of labor to fill the orders. Many of its potential employees fail drug tests and can't work the heavy machinery. A German company is the beneficiary of the firm's inability to fill all of its orders, the company's CEO told the Times.
The UNC study measured the relationship between opioid prescriptions and company growth by looking at sales and employment, using a proprietary Compustat sample of publicly traded firms and other data covering public and private companies.

Durant, Leonard could team-up with Knicks

Texto completo: As Kevin Durant and Kawhi Leonard mull their free agency options, the Knicks could emerge as the destination for both stars.
ESPN reported Saturday that Durant and Leonard have discussed playing together, and the only teams that will likely have the salary cap space to offer both max contracts are the Knicks and Los Angeles Clippers.
The Nets have space for one max deal already and could create room for a second, but one max slot will likely go to Kyrie Irving.
The Knicks and Clippers are planning to talk to Durant and Leonard once free agency begins Sunday at 6 p.m., according to the report.
Durant is likely going to miss next season while he recovers from a ruptured Achilles tendon, while Leonard is coming off a championship with the Toronto Raptors.
The Clippers pose a formidable challenge for the Knicks under this scenario.
They have a popular owner in Steve Ballmer, one of the league's top coaches in Doc Rivers and a young core that exceeded expectations this season and advanced to the playoffs.
The Knicks are coming off a league-worst 17-65 season and have a young, but still unproven, core in Kevin Knox, Mitchell Robinson, Dennis Smith Jr. and this year's No. 3 pick, RJ Barrett.
Landing both Durant and Leonard would be a huge win for the Knicks.
For months they had been rumored as the likely destination for Durant, but his injury threw more uncertainty onto his situation.
The Warriors can still offer him an extra year and more money than any other team, but there's a decent chance his days with Golden State are over.
Durant, who is currently in New York, could still team up with Irving in Brooklyn.
Leonard became extremely popular in Canada and appeared comfortable with the Raptors, but he's from Los Angeles. The Clippers have been rumored as the frontrunner to sign him.
But that started to change in recent days with the New York Times reporting that the Lakers, who have room to offer another max contract, would planning to aggressively pursue Leonard to form a Big Three with Leonard, LeBron James and Anthony Davis.
Leonard, though, is close with his uncle, Dennis Robertson, who lives in South Orange.
Nothing in NBA free agency is certain. Far from it.
Anything can happen.

It has been reported that Kawhi Leonard, right, could join up with Kevin Durant in free agency. The Knicks could land the duo.

Texto completo: Women recall how E. Jean Carroll described the alleged assault
Lisa Birnbach planned to take her friend's secret to the grave.
When E. Jean Carroll called more than two decades ago to tell her that she'd just been sexually assaulted by Donald Trump in a Manhattan department store dressing room, Birnbach said she begged Carroll to go to the police. When her friend resisted, Birnbach swore she'd never tell anyone.
Even after more than a dozen women came forward in 2016 to accuse the then-presidential candidate of kissing and groping them without consent, Birnbach said she didn't think about the episode again until Carroll told her last year that she had decided to write about it in a new book.
"I know a lot of women he has hassled," Birnbach said.
Trump has vehemently denied the claim by Carroll, a longtime Elle magazine columnist who went public last week with her description of the alleged assault. She is one of 16 women who have accused him of sexual misconduct, allegations he says are untrue.
Birnbach, a New York-based author, was one of two friends who told The Washington Post that Carroll had described the assault to them shortly after it allegedly happened. They both spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect their privacy.
After Trump and his allies attacked Carroll and her account, Birnbach and the second friend, former New York television anchor Carol Martin, decided to come forward this week, first speaking on the record to the New York Times.
"Apparently my validation makes E. Jean more believable, and my only goal is to be an honest person who tells the truth," Birnbach said. "I told the truth not as a political observer - I told what happened to my friend 23 years ago."
Martin said she was working with Carroll at a cable news station at the time of the alleged incident, which she said Carroll described to her as they sat in Martin's kitchen days later.
"She was dumbstruck," Martin said.
The decision by her two friends to go public comes as Carroll's allegation has stirred little political response, even among the president's critics. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) told reporters Thursday that she had not followed the story closely.
Birnbach, a former correspondent for CBS's "The Early Show" and co-author of "The Official Preppy Handbook," said she wasn't bothered that the Democrats were not focusing on the episode amid the turmoil of the Trump era.
"There will be another scandal breaking by dinner time, so you think, 'Don't go all in on this story, save some energy for the next story,' " she said, adding: "There are so many crises. You have to do triage on your emotions."
Carroll has said that during a chance encounter at a Bergdorf Goodman department store in New York in late 1995 or early 1996, Trump attacked her in a dressing room. Carroll said he knocked her head against a wall, pulled down her tights and briefly penetrated her before she pushed him off and ran out.
Trump has said Carroll is "totally lying" and added that she was "not my type." His allies, such as Fox News host Tucker Carlson, have sought to discredit Carroll's story, questioning why she did not come forward sooner.
Carroll told The Post that, like many women who have been assaulted, she blamed herself.
"It's such a personal decision, when you come forward and when you don't come forward," she said. "It's so personal."

Dems, please don't drive me away

Texto completo: I could never in a million years vote for Donald Trump. So my question to Democrats is: Will there be a candidate I can vote for?
According to a recent Gallup poll, 35% of Americans call themselves conservative, 35% call themselves moderate and 26% call themselves liberal. The candidates at the debates this week fall mostly within the 26%. The party seems to think it can win without any of the 35% of us in the moderate camp, the ones who actually delivered the 2018 midterm win.
The progressive narrative is dominating in part because progressives these days have a direct and forceful story to tell and no interest in compromising it. It's dominating because no moderate wants to bear the brunt of progressive fury by opposing it.
It's also dominating because the driving dynamic in this campaign right now is not who can knock off Joe Biden, the more moderate front-runner. It's who can survive the intense struggle between Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and others to be the surviving left-wing alternative. All the energy and competition is on the progressive side. Biden tries to bob and weave above it all while the whole debate pulls sharply leftward.
The party is moving toward all sorts of positions that drive away moderates and make it more likely the nominee will be unelectable. And it's doing it without too much dissent.
First, there is health care. When Warren raised her hand and said that she would eliminate employer-based health insurance, she made the most important gesture of the campaign so far. Over 70% of Americans with insurance through their employers are satisfied with their health plan. She and Sanders would take that away.
According to a Hill-HarrisX survey, only 13% of Americans say they would prefer a health insurance system with no private plans. Warren and Sanders pin themselves, and perhaps the Democratic Party, to a 13% policy idea. Trump is smiling.
Second, there is the economy. All the Democrats seem to have decided to run a Trump-style American carnage campaign. The economy is completely broken. It only benefits a tiny sliver. Yet in a CNN poll, 71% of Americans say that the economy is very or somewhat good. We're in the longest recovery in American history and the benefits are finally beginning to flow to those who need them most. Overall wages are rising by 3.5%, and wages for those in the lowest pay quartile are rising by well over 4%, the highest of all groups.
Democrats have caught the catastrophizing virus that inflicts the Trumpian right. They take a good point - that capitalism needs to be reformed to reduce inequality - and they radicalize it so one gets the impression they want to undermine capitalism altogether.
Third, Democrats are wandering into dangerous territory on immigration. They properly trumpet the glories that immigrants bring to this country. But the candidates can't let anybody get to the left of them on this issue. So now you've got a lot of candidates who sound operationally open borders. Progressive parties all over the world are getting decimated because they have fallen into this pattern.
Fourth, Democrats are trying to start a populist vs. populist campaign against Trump, which is a fight they cannot win. Democratic populists talk as if the only elite in America is big business, Big Pharma - the top 1%. This allows them to sound populist without actually going after their donor bases - the highly educated affluent people along the coasts.
But the big divide in America is not between the top 1% and the bottom 99. It's between the top 20% and the rest. These are the highly educated Americans who are pulling away from everybody else and who have built zoning restrictions and meritocratic barriers to make sure outsiders can't catch up.
If Democrats run a populist campaign against the business elite, Trump will run a broader populist campaign against the entire educated elite. His populism is more compelling to people who respond to such things. After all, he is actually despised by the American elite, unlike the Democrats.
Finally, Democrats aren't making the most compelling moral case against Donald Trump. They are good at pointing to Trump's cruelties, especially toward immigrants. They are good at describing the ways he is homophobic and racist. But the rest of the moral case against Trump means hitting him from the right as well as the left.
A decent society rests on a bed of manners, habits, traditions and institutions. Trump is a disrupter. He rips to shreds the codes of politeness, decency, honesty and fidelity, and so renders society a savage world of dog eat dog. Democrats spend very little time making this case because defending tradition, manners and civility sometimes cuts against the modern progressive temper.
The debates illustrate the dilemma for moderate Democrats. If they take on progressives they get squashed by the passionate intensity of the left. If they don't, the party moves so far left that it can't win in the fall.
Right now we've got two parties trying to make moderates homeless.

Texto completo: RECIFE, Brazil -- Throughout elementary and middle school, Ricardo Pavan Martins remembers reading Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis, one of Brazil's most famous writers.
So the 29-year-old, who lives in Bauru, was shocked to see a new image of Machado that has gone viral in the country. It shows him with chocolate-brown skin, considerably darker than how he appears in the black-and-white photograph that appears on virtually all of his books and hangs prominently in the Brazilian Academy of Letters.
"I always imagined him as white because this is the default image of most writers," Martins said. "I am certain that if the skin color of an author so important was at the very least discussed during my experience at school, my black friends would have felt more represented."
Among Brazilian writers, Machado, who lived from 1839 to 1908, inhabits a unique position. "Dom Casmurro," his 1899 masterpiece about cuckoldry and jealousy, is required reading at some schools around the country. His name has been lent to streets and subway stops across Brazil. Susan Sontag called him "the greatest writer ever produced in Latin America," and others have compared him to Flaubert, Kafka, Henry James and Alice Munro.
[ "The Collected Stories of Machado de Assis," one of the Times critics' top books of 2018, "reveals the arc of Machado's career, from the straightforward love stories to the cerebral and unpredictable later works." ]
The traditional historical photo of him shows a man whose skin is nearly as light as his crisp white dress shirt. But a new project, developed by the São Paulo office of the advertising agency Grey and São Paulo's University Zumbi dos Palmares, a predominantly black university, re-creates that photo in a way that the project's leaders say more accurately reflects what Machado looked like.
Machado was known to be the descendant of freed slaves, but the new rendering, which shows him as a black man, has shaken Brazilians, prompting some to reconsider how they previously read his work and angering others who feel his legacy had been whitewashed.
"Machado de Assis was basically turned into a blond guy with blue eyes," said José Vicente, the founder and director of the University Zumbi dos Palmares, named for the 17th-century leader of a Brazilian slave rebellion.
His school is leading the project as part of an effort to "reconstruct these black people from Brazilian history who over time became whitened or had their work forgotten," he said. "I think this project shows just how deep and powerful racism can be, but also the importance and necessity of recognizing black culture not just for the black community, but for all humanity. I think it's necessary for our country -- Brazil -- to know itself."
The university worked with Grey, who contracted historians to ensure the accuracy of the image and then managed the marketing and rollout of the project. Called Machado de Assis Real (The Real Machado de Assis), it encourages readers to download and print the new image and features posts on Instagram of students pasting it on top of existing ones in their books, along with the hashtag #machadodeassisreal.
The next goal, said Adriano Matos, chief creative officer at Grey, is to replace Machado's portrait at the Brazilian Academy of Letters, of which the novelist was the founding president. The academy's current president met with project leaders in May to receive the new portrait, which now hangs in the academy.
Matos hopes that publishers will begin to use the new image on book covers. "Our goal is that one day you can go onto Google image search and only see images of Machado de Assis as a black man," he said.
At least one small Brazilian publisher, Mâle, has committed to publishing Machado's work with the new portrait. Publishing houses in the United States, like the Norton imprint Liveright, which publishes the author's works in translation, said they had not heard of the project but would be open to considering a new portrait.
It isn't clear how or why Machado's image was lightened. Machado scholars like G. Reginald Daniel, a sociology professor at the University of California at Santa Barbara, said that in 19th-century Brazil, Machado's publishers "would have totally wanted him white to sell. For people to see this great author as of African descent would have been very troubling for many."
"He was celebrated during a period of Brazilian society where to be recognized and valued you had to be white," Matos said. "He would have never been taken seriously, and never achieved commercial success, if people had known his true racial identity. He would have been a failure if he had been known as black."
But some of those most familiar with Machado's life are ambivalent about the push to identify him as black. Daniel, who wrote a book exploring Machado's mixed-race identity, said that while he commended the efforts to "re-racialize" him, "the real Machado de Assis was not a black man but mixed. Portraying him otherwise misses the duality and in-between experience he had as a biracial man."
There may be a generational aspect at play in the re-imagination of Machado fostered by the project. Some older Brazilians are more aware of the writer's racial identity, while younger ones, who weren't taught about it in school, are not. For black students involved in the project, like Mayra Salles, it is an effort to change how future generations of black Brazilians consider themselves.
"My hope is that people like me won't have to deny or erase the color of their skin," said Salles, 26, a Zumbi university student who is also interning at Grey. "This project is an alert to the world: We are here and we won't take any step back. We are preparing ourselves to no longer tolerate the violence and discrimination that comes from racism."

Texto completo: No matter how badly politicians or regional coal barons would like to sell West Virginians on the idea of coal's resurgence, the writing has been on the wall for some time.
The major consumers that matter, energy companies, have been shifting away from coal since the mid-2000s, regardless of EPA restrictions or rolling those restrictions back. And, for the energy companies, it's not an issue of climate change. It's about the money. Natural gas is cheaper and, in some markets, renewables are becoming just as competitive in cost and efficiency.
So what's the big deal? West Virginia is sitting on plenty of natural gas and can still make plenty of money off of that, right?
Well, maybe.
The first problem for West Virginia is that the money coming into the state from the gas industry is mainly construction - building the pipelines that will pump the stuff elsewhere. Of course, a cracker plant or storage hub - as has been discussed in the past - could help the state maintain more jobs and see more revenue from gas, but talk has not yet turned into a plan or contract.
The more glaring problem is that West Virginia may be trading one fading industry just to go all in on another.
Natural gas, while not perhaps the sooty smokestack that coal is, still emits greenhouse gasses. According to a recent article in The New York Times, many energy companies are looking to rid their portfolios of both coal and natural gas as they try to drastically decrease emissions, or simply because it makes better financial sense.
It's unlikely that the demise of natural gas is imminent. As The Times points out, energy companies still plan to build around 150 new gas-fired power plants in the coming years, which will necessitate more pipelines. And the Southeast is still a market where natural gas is expected to rule, for a time, because of its relatively low cost and abundance.
Still, in the long run, it's worth asking whether West Virginia should put all of its economic hopes on another, inevitably finite extraction resource right after enduring the painful mark coal has left on the state in so many different ways.And the verdict on natural gas will come much quicker than the long slide of the coal industry.
This state, the rest of the country and the entire world are already seeing the havoc climate change has wrought, and some major decisions will have to be made within the next 10 years. Energy companies are realizing they don't have a future if the planet doesn't have one, either.
Of course, West Virginia's rugged terrain doesn't lend itself to investing in certain types of renewable energy production or manufacturing, like wind turbines. But there are other options. Research and expanded manufacturing capacity are certainly needed in improving the cost and efficiency (storage, distribution, etc) of solar power. This state doesn't have to be a slave to the extraction industries just because that's what people here are used to.
Change isn't easy, but, at some point, you just have to embrace it. The stakes are high, so West Virginia should be part of solving the problem. Why shouldn't West Virginia be a leader in the energy revolution?

Así enterrarán en El Salvador a padre e hija inmigrantes que murieron abrazados en el río Bravo

Texto completo: Óscar Alberto Martínez Ramírez y Valeria, padre e hija se fueron juntos de El Salvador con la idea de llegar a Estados Unidos en busca de un mejor futuro. Lo hicieron vivos, tomados de la mano junto a Tania, esposa de Óscar y madre de Valeria. Hoy, seis días después, la única que vuelve con vida es Tania, acompañando dos féretros y volviendo al país del que huyeron.
El domingo 23 de junio, Óscar decidió que no podían esperar más en Matamoros, México , donde permanecían albergados, en medio del hacinamiento, las altas temperaturas y la poca alimentación. Le dijo a Tania y Valeria que cruzarían hacia el otro lado por las aguas del río Bravo , pero la idea fue fatal para Óscar y Valeria, que terminaron arrastrados por una corriente y murieron.
Desde entonces la imagen de los dos salvadoreños ha recorrido todo el mundo, provocando indignación y tristeza. Las portadas de periódicos en todo el mundo, como The New York Times de Estados Unidos y The Independent de Reino Unido, han evocado la tragedia durante toda la semana.
* El conmovedor testimonio de la madre de Óscar, el migrante salvadoreño que murió junto a su hija en frontera de México y EUA
“En un mundo abrumado por el populismo es fácil para los líderes demonizar y deshumanizar a los migrantes, como ha hecho Trump. Víctimas de la guerra, el hambre y la pobreza, víctimas como este padre y su hija que tratan de ingresar a Estados Unidos, no son vistas por lo que son, vidas con igual valor, hasta que es demasiado tarde”, escribió The Independent en su portada de ayer, con la foto de Óscar y Valeria, y en clara crítica a la política migratoria de Donald Trump, presidente de los Estados Unidos.
Los cuerpos de Óscar y Valeria eran esperados ayer, pero durante el día había más dudas que respuestas. La madre de Óscar, Rosa Ramírez, aseguraba que nadie les había comunicado detalles sobre el retorno de sus seres amados. En la embajada de México en El Salvador sostenían que había vuelos atrasados desde aquel país y que eran esperados en horas de la noche. Y las autoridades de Relaciones Exteriores tampoco daban información certera.
* Así avanzan los preparativos para el sepelio de padre e hija salvadoreños ahogados en río Bravo
En Matamoros, ciudad fronteriza con Estados Unidos, los cuerpos de Óscar y Valeria esperaban ser movilizados hasta el aeropuerto más cercano, en Monterrey, a 300 kilómetros.
Los medios locales que cubrieron la noticia reportaron que Óscar y Valeria, acompañados de Tania, salieron de la funeraria a las 2 de la tarde, hora salvadoreña. Desde ahí eran aproximadamente tres horas de camino al aeropuerto y luego otras tres en el vuelo hasta El Salvador.
“Es la misma tragedia de gente desesperada, de inocentes que nunca sabrán por qué murieron y los que sí lo saben, seguirán sin hacer nada. La memoria colectiva olvida pronto”, destacó el miércoles la cadena española COPE, al hablar sobre el caso.
La tragedia ha servido también para que medios internacionales hagan eco de la crisis que se vive en la frontera entre México y Estados Unidos, donde se han intensificado las medidas contra los indocumentados. México reforzó con casi 25,000 soldados para evitar que los migrantes crucen hacia el otro lado y la política en los albergues es retener a los viajeros mientras reciben una cita formal para pedir asilo. Pero la velocidad de este método no da buenos resultados.
Ayer por la mañana, dos tumbas comenzaron a ser cavadas en el cementerio La Bermeja, en San Salvador. Empleados del lugar confirmaron que son para Óscar y Valeria, pero dijeron que tanto familiares como miembros del Gobierno, que coordinan la repatriación, han exigido privacidad en el entierro, que podría ser hoy. Una medida que será difícil de cumplir, dado que la atención mundial estará puesta en la llegada de las dos víctimas a su última morada.
A la orilla del río Bravo, hoy yace una rosa.

Texto completo: A letter signed by nearly 20 of the "richest 1/10 of the richest 1% of Americans" calls for 2020 presidential candidates to create a wealth tax on them and their ultrarich peers.
The 18 names on the letter published Monday include investor George Soros, filmmaker Abigail Disney, Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes, philanthropist Agnes Gund and real estate developer Robert Bowditch, among other members of the ultrawealthy. A 19th simply signed as "Anonymous. " Many of them have been outspoken before on the issue of wealth taxes.
"America has a moral, ethical and economic responsibility to tax our wealth more," they write in the letter, which was first reported by The New York Times. "A wealth tax could help address the climate crisis, improve the economy, improve health outcomes, fairly create opportunity, and strengthen our democratic freedoms. "
The letter describes itself as "nonpartisan" and not "an endorsement of any presidential candidate," though it lists Democratic candidates Elizabeth Warren, Beto O'Rourke and Pete Buttigieg as candidates who have already supported a wealth tax.
It's about time: Make America’s top tax rates great again
Everyone gets hurt: Tax the wealthiest of the 0. 1 percent? Not so fast.
In particular, they cite Warren's proposed policy – which would tax 75,000 of the wealthiest families in the country at a 2% rate – as a model for a policy that they endorse.
"That a moderate tax on a minuscule number of Americans could raise so much revenue simply reflects historic levels of wealth among America’s richest," they add.
The letter arrives the same day as a student loan debt proposal announced by Bernie Sanders, which would eradicate $1. 6 trillion in debt from 45 million Americans.
Sanders said his plan would be funded by a "Robin Hood Tax" that would impose a 0. 5% tax on stock trades, a 0. 1% fee on bonds and a 0. 005% fee on derivatives.

Texto completo: Would you trust Facebook with your money?
On Tuesday, Facebook confirmed it would launch a digital global currency similar to Bitcoin, called Libra, aimed at users around the world who don't have bank accounts.
But there's another reason Facebook is introducing Libra, said Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter: It's an opportunity to get some of its more than 2 billion users to shop through the platform.
"Facebook is merely trying to facilitate commercial activity for its customers, and the endgame is to offer links to brands they care about," he said.
The currency is managed by the Libra network, co-founded by several companies in both the payments and tech industries, including Facebook, eBay, Uber, Lyft, PayPal and Visa.
"Moving money around the world should be as easy and cheap as sending a text message," reads a description on Libra's website, noting more than 1. 7 billion people worldwide don't have a bank account.
With Facebook's massive user base, even a small portion of that audience jumping to cryptocurrency gives Libra a boost, said Pachter. "Even 1% is 20 million people. That’s enough," he said.
However, Libra could magnify privacy issues such as its stewardship over user data that have landed Facebook in hot water. Last month, a co-founder of Facebook wrote a New York Times op-ed calling for a breakup of the tech giant, which CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said would make its effort to resolve privacy issues more difficult.
Meanwhile, Litan said people concerned with Facebook's response to privacy issues have likely left the platform, while the users who stay and decide to use Libra will give up even more data.
"You’ll end up with bigger privacy issues going forward, frankly," said Litan.

Biden's problem with Democrats is that he doesn't hate Republicans

Texto completo: Joe Biden is leading in the polls for the Democratic presidential nomination because he's the most "electable" candidate in the Democratic field? A guy who doesn't realize that I worked with segregationists isn't a winning message with Democrats in 2020?
This is what you get when you turn to a candidate who has been in Washington for 46 years. Biden was first elected to the Senate in 1972, when the Democratic Party was very different. As a freshman senator, he had to get along with the senior leadership of his party – which included segregationists James Eastland of Mississippi and Herman Talmadge of Georgia.
You may be thinking: Who in the world are James Eastland and Herman Talmadge? You're not alone. Ninety-nine-point-nine percent of living Americans had either forgotten their names or never heard of them in the first place, until Biden decided to dredge them up from the fever swamps of the Democratic Party's sordid racial past.
Why, you ask, would he do such a thing? Because that's what Joe Biden does. He is a walking, talking gaffe machine. His point didn't even make sense. He was trying to argue that he can work across the aisle with people with whom he fundamentally disagrees. But Eastland and Talmadge sat on the same side of the aisle as Biden in the Senate; they were Democrats.
So now his younger, less popular Democratic opponents are pouncing on Biden's mistake. California Sen. Kamala Harris (averaging 7.1% in the polls) declared that for Biden "to coddle the reputations of segregationists, of people who if they had their way I would literally not be standing here as a member of the United States Senate, is, I think, it's just misinformed and it's wrong." New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker (2.3%) declared, "Vice President Biden's relationships with proud segregationists are not the model for how we make America a safer and more inclusive place for black people, and for everyone." New York Mayor Bill de Blasio (0.3%) tweeted, "It's 2019 & @JoeBiden is longing for the good old days of 'civility' typified by James Eastland. Eastland thought my multiracial family should be illegal."
Give me a break. No reasonable person thinks that Biden was defending or even sympathetic to segregation. What Biden was trying to do – in his own, Bideny way – was to defend not segregation but civility and compromise.
Recall that in February, Biden was forced to apologize for declaring – brace yourself – that Vice President Pence was a "decent guy."
This month, Biden was forced to flip-flop and abandon his four-decade-long support for the Hyde amendment -- bipartisan legislation that bars public funding for abortions -- after his Democratic opponents attacked him for what he once proudly called his "middle-of-the-road" policy on abortion.
In a January speech, Biden said, "I read in The New York Times today that one of my problems if I were to run for president, I like Republicans. Okay, well, bless me, Father, for I have sinned." Apparently, for many on the left, that sin is unforgivable.

Climate change is scary. 'Horns' from smartphone use aren't Journalists stirring up health panics are undermining the most critical stories of our time.

Texto completo: Reporters and editors at mainstream media outlets should be on their best behavior these days, after years of accusations of "fake news." But there's a type of misleading reporting that many are finding hard to avoid: the creation of phony health scares, usually mixed up with manners and morals.
Last week, The Washington Post fell into the trap with a claim that looking down at smartphones was causing young people's skulls to sprout "horns." Other news outlets followed.
Those who read beyond the headline learned that the alleged horns were just tiny "bone spurs" around the base of the skull. Playing down the observation that the spurs were also common in those over 60, the researchers speculated that they have something to do with reading off a phone screen because they were more common in young people than in those of middle age.
While smartphone reading has become ubiquitous, it's a relatively new phenomenon, and young people are seen as more likely to do it to excess. And so smartphones have generated great unease and headlines warning that they cause depression, increase the risk of suicide and make people fat. The Atlantic ran a cover story about how they may have "destroyed a generation."
The insides of people's heads are one thing, but the notion of adding horns to the outside is bound to go viral. The Post story contained a quote from a researcher at Yale who pointed out, quite reasonably, that the study on which the story was based did not include any information about cellphone use at all, so assuming a connection between the observed bone spurs and phone use is only a guess. But the reporter treated this as a bit of token skepticism rather than a reason to rethink the whole story.
The paper was initially thrust in the spotlight by the BBC, where it was included as part of a story on how modern life was changing the human skeleton. That story tied the phenomenon of spurs at the base of the skull to supporting the weight of the head in an unusual position during less-than-productive behavior: "As we lean forwards to pore over famous dogs on social media, our necks must strain," it read.
As a person who has a smartphone and is also a lifelong reader of books, I can attest that the reading posture would be the same for a more intellectually ambitious young person reading "Jane Eyre" on a tablet or an old-fashioned paperback. There's no way the media would try to scare people away from reading books.
Perhaps reporters and editors feel that excessive smartphone use is an annoying habit, and so they don't closely scrutinize a sensational claim about phone use.
A few outlets, such as The New York Times, followed with a skeptical take. Quartz pointed out that one of the researchers of the original study had a potential conflict of interest, because he is a chiropractor who sold "posture pillows." Still, the more important problem is the fact that the whole smartphone claim was backed by no evidence.
This spring, at a meeting at the Columbia School of Journalism, reporters were urged to more aggressively scare people about human-induced climate change. Fake news? Not at all, because there is ample evidence that it's happening, and that it's likely to get a lot worse. Fair and balanced reporting on the climate should be really scary. But the efforts of the environmental journalists are being undermined by the health journalists. The "horns" story just made it harder for readers to take any scary headline seriously.

Tyler Cowen's Big Business analyzes mistrust of US industry but offers no cure

Texto completo: In the fall of 1970, economist Milton Friedman wrote a now-famous article for the New York Times Magazine in which he argued that the sole responsibility of a corporation is to increase its profits.
If going viral on social media had been a possibility in that era, that piece would have.
What had happened, critics wondered: How could one of the best-known economists in the world empower businesses to treat employees and customers badly? While the argument itself was more nuanced and complicated than Friedman was usually given credit for, many viewed the implications as damning.
Nearly 50 years later, another economist, Tyler Cowen, has written a book responding to the furor. In Big Business: A Love Letter to an American Anti-Hero, the George Mason, free market contrarian blogger attempts to craft a new way of understanding the social responsibility of business.
Cowen, who is pro-business, agrees with Friedman that corporations are too often assumed to have the same values as individuals. He differs, however, in his belief that business at its best boosts both profits and social benefits. Friedman argued that corporations must choose one or the other.
Cowen starts by examining distrust of big business and its causes, including the Friedman piece. As of 2016, 51% of 18- to 29-year-olds didn't support capitalism and ranked business the second-lowest entity in terms of trust.
Such skepticism, Cowen argues, fails to appreciate that big business “makes most of the stuff we enjoy” and "gives most of us jobs.” Large companies represent some of society's most virtuous organizations, he said, because their international brands give them a financial incentive to act in society's best interests as well as their own.
The author does a terrific job of simplifying and defining the dilemma, but the rest of the book misses multiple opportunities to address it.
Instead of building a thesis around how businesses fulfill their social responsibilities, Cowen organizes his arguments around American complaints about corporations, with chapters such as “Is Work Fun?” or “What is Wall Street Good For, Anyway?”
Some work better than others. In a chapter about technology, he glosses over a debate about how Silicon Valley firms gather and leverage user data. Those that care about user-privacy concerns ultimately will outlast their rivals that don't, Cowen maintains.
His argument that “our friends, relatives, colleagues, and acquaintances,” pose a “bigger privacy risk” than Big Tech is particularly weak. Where gossip can expose your personal drama to your inner circle, the internet can reveal secrets you hoped to conceal to a much wider audience, sell it to others, and preserve it for posterity.
While judging which is “scarier” is inherently subjective, I find it hard to believe that gossip can damage you more than pools of data that follow you for a lifetime.
Cowen's most problematic chapter, however, is about CEO pay. To back up his position that CEOs aren't overpaid, he says their roles are similar to those of lawyers in that they must attract clients and create wealth, despite the fact that most lawyers bill by the hour, while many CEOs often start with a seven-figure base salary.
When I asked him to clarify, he said that incentive pay for CEOs includes equity and options that are linked to the stock markets, so corporate titans are, in essence, paid for performance.
That fails to acknowledge just how much CEO pay has risen in comparison with average employees. In 2017 alone, CEO compensation climbed 18.9%, while wages for average employees grew just 0.3%, which in my eyes is very troubling.
He also argued that CEOs are increasingly hired from outside a company and boards have to pay more to attract them. Still, only 26.5% of top managers are outside hires, which is far from the majority.
Regardless of its flaws, the book is very well written. Cowen’s prose is clear and understandable even to people who have no background in economics, but the simplification necessary to achieve that means he doesn't fully explore some important ideas and misses others altogether.
At one point, for instance, he casually asserts that certain “gentrification” is a good thing. While I would agree to some extent, gentrification is a hotly debated issue for many, particularly apartment-dwellers and small businesses who lose homes and storefronts to rising rents.
Simplification also causes Cowen to contradict himself. In chapters regarding monopolies, he advocates less regulation, maintaining that excessive rule-making serves as a barrier to entry for new companies.
That's not an unreasonable argument, but it's weakened by its juxtaposition with sections examining how to empower the biggest companies to do their best work, a goal that might justify supporting monopolies via regulation.
It's clear that's not what Cowen wants, but the tension is left completely unaddressed.
Ultimately, the structure of the book weakens Cowen's thesis, and he fails to differentiate himself much from Friedman. His final conclusion is that the social responsibility of businesses is to “come up with new and better conceptions of the social responsibility of a business.”
In other words, businesses have to come up with better ways to sell themselves. It's not a very interesting or satisfactory answer, and it's particularly frustrating in light of the book's potential.
Providing a counterpoint to Friedman might have been incredibly insightful. Instead, the book attempts to poke holes in people’s understanding of business, rather than advance it. For these reasons and more, Cowen’s latest effort is a disappointment.

Texto completo: Legendary multi-billionaire businessman Eli Broad wrote a heartfelt New York Times opinion column this month urging a broad wealth tax to improve income inequality. Worthy goal. The column's subhead says, “Wealthy people like me should commit to reducing the ravages of economic inequality. ” Most wealth lists say I’m only worth about half what Broad is, but I have an idea for him that is twice as good, faster and more direct than any wealth tax.
We all want people to do better — or should. Helping is surely good; but how to do it best? Broad specifically wants a $15 an hour minimum wage, education reform, expanded medical care access and more affordable housing. Two decades ago, he embraced full-time philanthropy to work towards many of those ends. How is that working for you, Broad?
Well now, finally, he recognizes, “no amount of philanthropic commitment will compensate for the deep inequities preventing most Americans — the factory workers and farmers, entrepreneurs and electricians, teachers, nurses and small-business owners — from the basic prosperity we call the American dream. ” So now he wants us both taxed higher via a wealth tax.
You've got money to spare — spend it
Here’s what you should do. Quit all that feel good philanthropy. Forget the taxes. Presumably you have some liquidity or you couldn’t pay extra in taxes or offer philanthropy. Then take that liquidity, all of it, however much of your $6. 7 billion net worth, and go hire as many of those people you want to help as you can. Focus them on doing something people want and will pay for.
Some call that entrepreneurship. I call it a no-brainer. You can call it capitalism, or whatever. Regardless, you put them immediately into doing good for others (or if others don’t think it’s good, they won’t buy your product). You immediately reduce income inequality for those hired (they made less or nothing before, by definition, or they won’t come to work for you). You create your own training programs.
Drain the Financial District: What Democrats must tell Trump: Get infrastructure money from corporations and the rich
You say you can’t figure out what they should do? Well, if a successful businessman like Eli Broad can’t figure how to put people to work to do good, at great incomes, reducing income inequality immediately, how in high holy heck is rocket scientist Uncle Sam gonna do it with neo-revised visions of Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society-type programs-to-nowhere? You can do it fast, right now and help solve this problem relative to your wealth’s fair share compared to others.
It is what I am doing.
I, once broke, started a taxable for-profit business in 1979 that I’ve built since 1993 as a veritable taxable non-profit. My firm’s profits get plowed back in routinely, growing jobs, paying people more, reducing more income inequality by putting more people to work. That’s how I got half as rich as you. I’m still at it. No profit; no tax. It’s satisfying when I hear families’ stories.
I think you would be better at this than me. You are business savvy. Consider it this way. Only one of two things can happen. You either succeed, or you fail. It works either way.
Entrepreneurship is a win-win-win
If you succeed you did your full share to reduce income inequality. You made customers happy or they wouldn’t buy your product. Your employees paid their fair share of income tax so Uncle Sam isn’t mad. And, you actually got wealthier so you can do even more of it next year, helping even more people.
If your business fails, you still paid the people you hired. If you think about it, that is almost perfectly equal to a transfer payment — which is certainly what happens when Uncle Sam taxes you. Look at the make-up of federal spending since you’ve done philanthropy; it’s mostly transfer payments anyway. So, your failed enterprise is basically equal to if you were taxed that much. Yet those you hired had jobs, learned new skills, added to their resume — while seeking their next step up.
We wealthy should help. But smart business folks like you should do it faster and better by directly putting people into what Bill Clinton called "high-paying jobs. " Go higher. It’s the economy, stupid. Always was. Fifteen bucks an hour is no destination. You can create your own great destinations without any tax.

No more ‘poverty naps’ on campus

Texto completo: When college students return to their campuses in the fall, many will face a growing problem that threatens to undermine their chances for success. Hunger. Recent surveys agree that more than one-third of all college students suffer at times from bouts of food insecurity. The rate is far higher for students with an extra risk factor: belonging to a racial minority, having a single parent or being the first in their family to attend college, for example.
A New York Times report on local campuses told these stories: "A senior at Lehman College in the Bronx dreams of starting her day with breakfast. An undergraduate at New York University said he has been so delirious from hunger he’s caught himself walking down the street not realizing where he’s going. A health sciences student at Stony Brook University on Long Island describes ‘poverty naps,’ where she decides to go to sleep rather than deal with her hunger pangs."
In one sense, the problem reflects good news: the growing diversity of student bodies, from both racial and socioeconomic perspectives. A recent study by the Government Accountability Office says only 29% of those now in college are "traditional students," who enroll right out of high school and depend on their parents for support. The rest, especially in community colleges, can be older, and financially fragile — often with children of their own. But federal aid programs have not kept up with this changing profile and rising need. Forty years ago, Pell grants, the main source of public support for needy students, covered half the average cost at two-year colleges and 39% at public four-year colleges. Today, according to statistics from the Department of Education, those rates have dropped to 37% at community schools and 19% at bigger universities.
The result could be called the "hunger gap," which Steve sees firsthand at George Washington University, where he has taught for almost 30 years. The way the federal government calculates a student’s annual need is woefully inadequate, and even students with "full rides" can have trouble affording full meals.
One answer is a rapid expansion of campus-based food banks. Many campuses have tried other innovations. Programs called Share Meals and Swipe Out Hunger enable students to donate their unused dining hall credits to hungry classmates. There are more. One critical change would involve SNAP, the federal nutrition program once known as food stamps. Its rules regarding student eligibility remain highly restrictive and confusing, and the GAO reports that about 2 million students who could have qualified for aid in 2017 did not receive it.
Simplifying the rules and extending eligibility to more students makes total sense. But the Trump administration is actually trying to reduce the program and eliminate recipients, even as the need continues to grow. That’s both profoundly immoral and utterly counterproductive. Programs to combat hunger easily pay for themselves: Students who don’t have to worry about food do better in school, graduate at higher rates and are more likely to become productive, taxpaying citizens.
The public policy goal should be completely clear and compelling: No more growling stomachs in classrooms. No more "poverty naps" instead of lunch.

Texto completo: In a recent opinion column in The New York Times, David Brooks makes the case that there should be more rituals in life and in society.
"Rituals often mark doorway moments, when we pass from one stage of life to another. They acknowledge that these passages are not just external changes but involve internal transformation," Brooks writes.
Brooks also writes about the value of "collective rituals" for communities; occasions that, among other things, would be for "people to make promises toward one another — specific ways they are going to use their gifts to solve the common challenge. Towns are built when people make promises to one another, hold people accountable and sacrifice together through repeated interaction toward a common end."
That really is the essence of a college education. Colleges provide those doorway moments for people. In fact, our vision statement at Waubonsee begins with, "Waubonsee Community College opens the door of knowledge."
The people who pass through the door of knowledge are then prepared to use their knowledge and skills to solve common problems and work toward that common end.
In the 2018-2019 academic year, we recognized and celebrated the accomplishments and contributions of many people at Waubonsee. People like Chad Lockman, Cassie Day and Heather Binder, who all graduated from Waubonsee and now help their communities through assisting military veterans, teaching, and improving living conditions, respectively.
We highlighted the student success coaches who help people achieve their dreams of a college education, and we featured the college’s Fire Science Technology Program, which trains future community first responders and leaders.
We also joined with our community by providing the new Aurora Strong Scholarship as a recognition of the community support and strength demonstrated after the tragic shooting of Feb. 15 in Aurora.
James Fallows, a longtime correspondent for The Atlantic, wrote a book with his wife Deborah in 2018 about the travels to cities and towns across America. He wrote in "Our Towns: A 100,000-Mile Journey Into the Heart of America," "Not every city can have a research university. Any ambitious one can have a community college. And while research universities are the most important parts of the U.S. educational system from a global perspective, I’ve come to think that community colleges matter most domestically right now."
At last month’s commencement we celebrated our 51st graduating class, a collective ritual marking both the external changes and internal transformation of people as they prepare to enrich their lives, their families and their communities.
We are grateful to play a part in the contributions that Waubonsee alumni make within our community every day.

Texto completo: A surge of migrants arriving at the Texas-Mexico border has pushed the country's immigration system to the breaking point as new policies aimed at both undocumented immigrants and legal asylum seekers have contributed to a humanitarian crisis. The Texas Tribune is maintaining its in-depth reporting on this national issue.
More in this series
WASHINGTON — As reports of migrant children being held in squalid conditions at federal facilities near the border continue to draw outrage, Democrats successfully pushed a $4.5 billion humanitarian aid package through the U.S. House late Tuesday evening with a vote of 230 to 195.
The passage of the bill marks a narrow victory for Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, who managed to coalesce a unified front after several days of uncertainty and division within the party. Ultimately, only four Democrats broke rank, and none of them were Texans. Among the Republicans from the state, U.S. Rep. Will Hurd, R-Helotes, was the only member to buck his party, voting in favor of the bill. Hurd's district covers much of the state's border with Mexico.
In the days leading up to the vote, opposition on the Democratic side was concentrated primarily among members of the House Progressive and Congressional Hispanic caucuses who voiced concerns that the Trump administration would twist the bill’s intent to put some of the money toward border enforcement rather than migrant aid.
On a Sunday conference call, more than 15 members of the Hispanic Caucus and 30 members of the Progressive Caucus expressed their reservations about supporting the bill, according to The New York Times. And at a tense meeting in Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi’s office Monday evening, prominent members of both groups spoke against the bill.
Before the bill reached the House floor for a vote Tuesday evening, a notice from the U.S. House Appropriations Committee revealed that amendments to the bill would add several provisions aimed at funneling allocations directly into humanitarian aid. They established a 90-day limit on the retention of unaccompanied children at detention facilities, required higher standards of medical care and hygiene for unaccompanied children, and guaranteed access to translation services and legal support funds for all detained migrants. The new version of the bill also includes an accountability clause that threatens to end contracts with detention centers that fail to meet a certain standard of upkeep.
Democrats found themselves under heightened pressure to expedite border relief funding after inflammatory reports last week about the conditions within migrant detention centers. The Associated Press and other outlets exposed overcrowding, poor hygiene, and a lack of soap, diapers and toothpaste at a detention center in the West Texas town of Clint, citing lawyers who are monitoring conditions there under the terms of the Flores agreement, a 1993 settlement that dictates how children and families should be held in detention. More than a dozen children at the Clint facility were reportedly sick, and some were being quarantined, the AP reported.
U.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar, an El Paso Democrat with membership in both the House Progressive and House Hispanic caucuses, played a central role in shoring up support for the bill among the Democrats' left wing.
As the vote on the bill, originally expected earlier Tuesday, was pushed later into the evening, Escobar expressed her exasperation outside of afternoon votes.
"Oh my God! I am all for improving this bill and would never oppose efforts to make improvements, but this is a supplemental appropriations bill," Escobar said. "It's not an immigration bill, and there is an urgency, at least on my part, to get it out the door as quickly as possible."
Still, for U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the rest of the Democratic leadership, the bill presented a double bind. Pushing the bill through creates the risk that the Trump administration will use some of the funds to further his immigration agenda. But by blocking the bill, Democrats would have ensured further delays in addressing the poor detention center conditions at the border and provided Trump with potential fodder to shift the blame toward them.
At a press conference Tuesday morning featuring some proponents of the bill, Escobar acknowledged "legitimate concerns" about how the Trump administration could implement the funding. But she said that the legislation had "been crafted very carefully" with an eye towards closing loopholes that the Trump administration might use to direct the funding toward enforcement or deportation.
"Those appropriators have guaranteed that this money cannot be transferred," Escobar said. "So it cannot be used for mass deportations. It cannot be used for an ICE deportation force."
The House bill will need to be reconciled with a version proposed in the Republican-led Senate.
“The sooner that they take up the bill that we pass today and the sooner the president signs that bill, the sooner that that funding will get where it needs to go,” Escobar said.
But House Republicans were quick to criticize Democrats for not trying to craft a bill that could have drawn more bipartisan support. In a tweet, U.S. Rep. Michael Burgess, R-Lewisville, accused Democrats of choosing to “perpetuate hatred of the President” over pursuing “real solutions.”
U.S. Rep. Randy Weber, R-Friendswood, similarly argued that Democrats have ignored crisis signals at the border. "Rather than operating in a bipartisan fashion, House Democratic leadership offered a bill which will only exacerbate the situation," he said in a statement.

Texto completo: I love to travel. I love trying out a new hotel, sleeping in a California king-sized bed and not having to worry about making my bed in the mornings.
The one thing that's always true about traveling is that it costs money. And I'm all about saving money. So, here are my best travel tips to help you keep more of your hard-earned dollars in your pocket:
1. Cheapest days to fly If you're flying, travel on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays
These are cheapest days to be in the air. If you can arrange your trip and vacation days to accommodate, you'll save money!
2. Avoid baggage fees Don't forget that many airlines will charge you to check a bag, which could cost an extra $50 to $100 round-trip per person. So, factor this in when you're shopping for low fares, or just pack more efficiently into a carry-on.
3. Be wary of travel points Don't open a credit card just for the travel points
Even if you think you're "working the system," and you'll pay if off before it's due, the facts say there's a real chance you won't. One in three Americans are behind on bills. Payments have a tendency to pile up, and they steal more than your paycheck. They steal your joy, too.
4. Look into Airbnb With Airbnb, you can rent someone's whole house, or even just one room in their house, and many times it's a lot cheaper than staying in a hotel. If you're a real go-getter, try reaching out to the owner directly and make them an offer. The worst they can do is say no!
5. First get debt-free Don't take a vacation if you have debt.
I know there's always one reason or another to spend money going somewhere. But if you're in debt, now isn't the time to take elaborate vacations. All your extra money should be going toward building up a starter emergency fund or paying off debt. Trust me, you'll enjoy that beach trip so much more when you have money in the bank, and you paid for it with cash.
For more tips on how to save money traveling, I've got two episodes of The Rachel Cruze Show that will help you: Travel Tips That Will Save You Money and How to Go to Disney World Without Debt.
As a No.1 New York Times best-selling author and host of The Rachel Cruze Show, Rachel helps people learn the proper ways to handle money and stay out of debt. You can follow Cruze on Twitter and Instagram at @RachelCruze and online at rachelcruze.com.

Texto completo: Jeremy Wechsler was on his way to rehearsal one morning in March when his phone started, and then wouldn't stop, going off.
The artistic director of Chicago's Theater Wit was at the helm of "Admissions," a wry glimpse at privilege and educational opportunity through the eyes of a white teenager -- deferred from his dream school -- and his parents, officials focused on diversifying their East Coast boarding school. The play was set to begin performances in just over a week.
As Mr. Wechsler made his way to the theater, he got one text after another -- "Have you seen this?" -- with links to that morning's unfolding news: Federal prosecutors had charged 50 parents, coaches and test administrators in a wide-reaching college admissions scheme, a scandal implicating wealthy families who, according to the Justice Department, had cheated, bribed and photoshopped their children's way into elite universities.
"Admissions," which was written by Joshua Harmon and opened Off Broadway exactly a year before the scandal broke, doesn't have much to say on bribery (or cropping a student's face onto a water polo player's body, for that matter). But its overarching themes -- how far parents will go to secure opportunities for their children, and the systemic advantages some demographic groups wield over others -- reverberated through the emerging details of the scandal.
"Of course everyone was like, 'You're so lucky; your show's going to do amazing,"' Mr. Wechsler said.
And they weren't necessarily wrong: The Chicago production will close Sunday after three extensions, which added 14 weeks to the unusually successful run for the theater. The play is also picking up speed across the country, with 13 other productions being licensed through 2020. Like Mr. Harmon's 2013 "Bad Jews," "Admissions" is on track to be one of the most-produced plays at regional theaters in the next year.
But if there is a correlation between the scandal buzz and the new show's buzz, it's a murky one. "Admissions" had already made its way to several regional theaters, including a Washington, D.C., production that saw four extensions, before anyone was charged in the investigation.
Not to mention: The idea of theatergoers throwing down their newspapers and sprinting to the box office? Not entirely plausible.
Paul Daigneault programmed the play as part of SpeakEasy Stage Company's 2019-20 season last summer, nearly a year before the news broke. SpeakEasy, which is based in Boston, targets shows that can generate cultural conversation, he said, and if anything, the scandal will make the conversation resonate even more. (SpeakEasy's production begins performances in October.)
"The events of the play do not perfectly coincide or mirror the effects of the college admissions scandal," said Mr. Daigneault, the theater's artistic director. "White privilege and the idea of America hiding behind its liberalism until the mirror is turned around and facing you is what makes it even more relevant."
Theater Wit's ticket sales didn't explode when the admissions scandal broke. Rather, it was when previews began, Mr. Wechsler said, that word-of-mouth referrals "went through the roof."
"I would sit in the lobby, and I would listen to people as they were coming out and they would be on their phones, literally calling people and saying, 'You've got to come see this show,"' he said.
Post-show conversations that usually lasted 20 minutes were running twice as long. One white woman emailed Mr. Wechsler a letter recounting and renouncing her long-held resentment of colleagues of color for what she saw as their unfair advancement.
Mr. Harmon declined to comment about the way "Admissions" reverberates with recent events. And the play's tricky, satirical tone -- and its array of seemingly well-meaning liberal characters -- already made it one to argue about. They include Charlie, a high school senior who embarks on a 17-minute diatribe on who really counts as a person of color, and his mother, Sherri, who ditches her diversity-oriented priorities when her own child's success is at stake.
Jesse Green, in The New York Times, praised the Lincoln Center Theater production for "lancing the boil of our own self-deception," while Sara Holdren, in New York magazine, argued that what is intended "as a pointed deflation of white self-righteousness ... winds up undermining the ideas it's striving to address."
The 26-year-old actor Ben Edelman played Charlie at Lincoln Center as well as in a London run that concludes Saturday. In a recent interview, he compared the admissions scandal to a fun house mirror: a heightened version of the problems in education that typically manifest in less egregious ways.
"One of the things that's kind of exciting about the play is how it doesn't reduce the conversation," Mr. Edelman said. "It complicates the conversation. It's not black and white. It's dealing with the shades of gray."
As previews in Chicago began, the nature of the scandal was one of Mr. Wechsler's biggest concerns. Would the conversation about the play be hijacked by a discussion of behavior that was easy to condemn?
"A lot of parents who come to the play are like, you have to do whatever you can to help your kids," he said. "Then followed two beats later like, 'Not like those parents."'
But for some, the scandal added a realistic framework to "Admissions." Kate Phillippo, a professor of cultural and educational policy studies at Loyola University Chicago who spoke on a post-show panel in May, said the admissions scheme shaped her understanding of how desperate parents can be to ensure their children get a distinguished education.
"We're asking kids to think about equity and social justice -- or at least I hope we are -- and we're also asking them to compete," Dr. Phillippo said. "And those two things in a lot of ways are opposed to one another. You want equity, but you also want to get ahead of other people. And to some degree, everybody can't have both of those things."
Lisa Levy, a parent and educator in Chicago who saw the play in March, said that the admissions scandal didn't affect her perception of the show, but that the play did lead her to reflect on how she handled her own children's college application process.
"With or without the scandal," Ms. Levy said, "I thought it was a really relevant play to the times."

The 10% bonus that Trump needs

Texto completo: True, polls have very limited value at this stage of a presidential campaign. Yes, Democrats are far from choosing their nominee to oppose President Donald Trump. Of course, a great deal can change between now and Election Day.
Or maybe not.
Since Trump’s victory, the political balance has remained remarkably stable, and that’s both good and bad news for a president who formally launched his re-election campaign this week with a raucous rally in Florida.
On the plus side for Trump, his base shows no signs of cracking. When the president mused on Twitter recently that his supporters "would demand" he stay in office after eight years — a totally unconstitutional idea — he was accurately reflecting their unswerving devotion. "To too many people, he’s not a human being. He’s a demigod," said conservative radio host Michael Savage to The New York Times.
But the downside of this frozen landscape is equally obvious. Trump’s core base of support hovers between 35% and 37% of the electorate, and despite their fervid loyalty, that base is simply not large enough to guarantee him a second term. Trump won 46.4% of the vote in 2016, and he needs at least a 10% margin above and beyond his base — call it the 10% bonus — to have a realistic chance at a second term.
Recent polls clearly reveal the president’s peril. Two surveys in Michigan, one of three states that gave Trump his margin of victory in 2016, show Trump trailing former Vice President Joe Biden by double digits. In Pennsylvania, a Quinnipiac poll had Biden beating Trump by 11 points. A national survey conducted by Fox News put Biden ahead by a similar margin.
An average of all national polls puts Trump’s favorable rating at 43.3%. As Peter Baker points out in The Times, "He is the only president in the history of polling who has never once, not for a single day, earned the support of a majority of Americans surveyed by Gallup."
Trump’s real base is actually even smaller. In 2016, only 38% of voters told exit polls he was qualified to be president, 35% said he had the proper temperament, and 33% described him as honest and trustworthy.
The president enters the race with many strengths. The unemployment rate of 3.6% in May was the lowest in 50 years, and in the latest CNN poll, 56% approved of his economic policies, a new high. Trump, who never really stopped campaigning, enjoys a huge lead over the Democrats in building a national organization and raising money. Above all, the Democrats are far from producing a candidate who can generate the sort of energy and excitement that powered the campaigns of Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, the only successful Democrats in more than 40 years.
For all the turmoil generated by the Trump presidency, not much has changed politically since his election. His base remains just about the same. He won in 2016 because about 1 in 10 voters who were not part of that base, and who had serious doubts about his character and qualifications, disliked Hillary Clinton enough to vote for him anyway. Can Trump win over that 10% again? The election could well hinge on the answer.

China’s Great Firewall and the end of globalization

Texto completo: The Great Firewall of China—Beijing’s AI-powered website blocker, used to shut down Western media penetration—is spelling an end to the era of globalization. While digital tech encompasses the world, the East and the West have hardened into two separate spheres. There is no looking back.
Through the Great Firewall, China’s leadership has turned off nearly every major English-language news outlet, from the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal on down. The Washington Post and the Guardian, two of the last survivors, were zeroed our in time for the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre.
Social media has not been spared. All the big US platforms and services, Google, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, are access denied; group chat applications like WhatsApp are firmly out of reach.
Companies including Google have struggled, sometimes secretly, to figure out how to get back into the Chinese market, even if it means working on much cozier or even riskier terms with the country’s military than Americans—and their own workers—are ready to tolerate. The dream of one globally integrated world, networks and ultimately controlled by the masters of the internet, dies hard.
But it has died. Nowhere is the digital divide between East and West sharper than it is where Hong Kong stops and the rest of China begins. Rebellion against a draconian extradition law that would see Hong Kong residents spirited away to the mainland for punishment made national Western headlines, with huge crowds spilling into the streets—and voluntarily shutting down their own online activity to frustrate or defeat Chinese monitoring.
That’s a long way from the days of the Arab Spring, when autocratic regimes put their internets on lockdown to stop protests from mobilizing into more serious political opposition. Today, governments have learned how to reassert sovereignty over their digital domains—not just how to pull the plug.
But for China the two are hardly mutually exclusive. The goal is no Western media, just as Western religion, which is seen to breed rampant heresy, instability, and factionalism, is being all but expunged from the country. China’s digital plan is to remoralize its billion-plus population before venality and vice wrecks civil society.
That’s frighteningly Orwellian to the West. In China, by contrast, the Orwellian imagination is unwelcome: both the fear of servility and the fear of mastery at the heart of 1984. Technological times have changed since Orwell’s day—digital rule is about the triumph of machine memory, not of Big Brother’s compulsory fantasies—but in the West, the dystopian vision endures. In China, no such millennia-old tradition of the slavery-and-mastery morality play exists.
It’s not that the Chinese can have no appreciation for freedom, of course; it’s that their experience with digital will simply not shape them and be shaped by them in the same way as we in the West will ours.
That alone marks a harsh lesson for Western elites. Those clinging bitterly to certitudes that more modernization, more money, or more engagement will eventually bring down the autocratic regime in favor of Western-style democracy are indulging in a fantasy every bit as dangerous as 2 + 2 = 5.
In technology, leading Westerners are beside themselves to see Chinese researchers and companies being squeezed out from American positions. But China has so penetrated strategic American tech and science that it would be negligent at best not to do so.
In academia, leading Westerners fear that the loss of lucrative Chinese students and access to brilliant Chinese graduate students will gobble America’s development of next-generation tools and patents. But the West has grown too lazy and comfortable leaning on outside talent while home-grown students become over-credentialed and under-employable ingrates with a resentful sense of entitlement and little game plan for the future.
And in entertainment media, leading Westerners have grown similarly dependent on “international”—read Chinese—audiences to prop up box office numbers, make movies marketable and produceable, and sustain the illusion that Hollywood and its power brokers hold real cultural authority in America and beyond. But the reality of a contracting and consolidating industry with little to say about life besides formulaic and narrow-cast cultural politics is inescapable.
The message China has sent the West’s elite, in other words, is painfully simple: you need us more than we need you. And the West agrees. It is Western elites, not Chinese ones, who are still hung up on the utopian dream of creating one harmonious and standardized world. China’s bid for international power hinges on its domestic priorities of preventing chaos, civil strife, and the collapse of its sovereignty; if Beijing thought it could lock its power in and fully establish state morality through the populace without a hugely risky intercontinental economic and infrastructure program, it likely would have gone in that direction. It didn’t.
And the West? It harbors three leading assets over the Chinese: its media apparatus, its military capability, and its financial power. Of these, the first has effectively been neutralized in China. The third is holding steady, but the second is showing cracks in its mystique. If China can use technology to make its absolute sovereign control over its culture and morality complete, it will consider itself to have the upper hand.
And if the West continues to fragment into weak and Balkanized camps dominated by bureaucratic revolutionaries at odds with their country’s histories and cultures, and ultimately their own countrymen, the Chinese will be right.

Texto completo: A presentation by New York Times best-selling author and Pittsburgh area native Marie Benedict will kick off Peters Township Public Library's second annual Read Local/Eat Local event this weekend.
The event, which brings together local authors and area food trucks for a day of reading and eating, will be from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. June 22 at the library. Ms. Benedict's presentation is scheduled to begin at 10 a.m., followed by a book signing.
Ms. Benedict, who hails from the South Hills, said the topic for the presentation likely will be her latest book, "The Only Woman in the Room," which was chosen as a national Barnes & Noble Book Club pick and was a New York Times bestseller.
The story is about film star Hedy Lamarr, whose career spanned from the 1930s to the late 1980s. Far away from the Hollywood scene, Ms. Lamarr's technological creation more than 75 years ago served as the foundation for Wi-Fi.
According to the official Hedy Lamarr website, at the start of World War II, Ms. Lamarr along with composer George Anthiel developed a radio guidance system called "frequency hopping" that solved the problem of enemies trying to block signals from radio-controlled missiles.
The technology involved changing radio frequencies to prevent enemies from being able to detect the messages.
Basic principles of their work were incorporated into bluetooth technology and are similar to those methods used in the first versions of Wi-Fi. Ms. Lamarr and Mr. Anthiel were inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2014.
"It shares the astonishing narrative of a young Jewish woman in 1930s Vienna, married to Austria's richest man, an arms dealer to Mussolini and then Hitler, who escapes to the Hollywood film world, but desirous of striking out against the Nazis, invents a groundbreaking weapons system - if only the Navy would use an invention made by a woman," Ms. Benedict writes in her book.
The author also will have a question-and-answer period during her presentation. Ms. Bendict said she would be happy to discuss any of her books. She also has authored "The Other Einstein" and "Carnegie's Maid."
She said she used the city of Pittsburgh for inspiration for "Carnegie's Maid," in which she uses historical Pittsburgh and her ancestors' experiences as Irish immigrants in the 1800s.
She currently is working on a book titled "Lady Clementine," which focuses on Winston Churchill's wife. It is to be released in January 2020.
Registration is required to attend Ms. Benedict's presentation, and seating is limited. Call the library at 724-941-9430 to register to attend. Registration is not required to attend the rest of the event.
Local authors attending Read Local/Eat Local are: Audrey Abbott, Elizabeth Babcock, Chuck Beard, Brian Butko, Mike Buzzelli, Jamie Beth Cohen, Carrie DiRisio, Angele Ellis, David Finoli, Ellen Goodlett, Melanie Linn Gutowski, Ben Gwin, Peter Hayers, Tom Imerito, Lori Jakiela, Quelcy Kogel, J. Judson Lacko, Joe Moore, Jaqui Phillips, Leah Pileggi, Chad and George Shannon and Bob Walicki.

Texto completo: A new documentary, "Toni Morrison: The Pieces I Am" (in theaters Friday in New York and Los Angeles, expands through summer), seeks to demystify the acclaimed 88-year-old writer, digging into her personal history, showcasing how her work probes the interior lives of African Americans and highlighting the moments in her remarkable career that became touchstones.
Here are five things you probably don't know about Morrison, from how her friendship with Oprah Winfrey started to how she worked her magic on Muhammad Ali.
1. Toni Morrison worked as an editor for years while also writing her own books Morrison began her career as a professor at Howard University, before spotting a classified ad in The New York Review of Books in 1965 for a book editor in Syracuse. That imprint soon was acquired by Random House, sending Morrison to New York, where the single mother of two sons nurtured many influential black writers, including Toni Cade Bambara, Gayl Jones and Lucille Clifton. But at night, she worked on her own books. "Editors are not writers. So I don't tell anybody," she says.
2. She was castigated by early critics for not writing about white people In a 1973 review of "Sula," The New York Times criticized Morrison, saying her work was boxed in by her insistence on writing about her own community – without including confrontation with whites. "Toni Morrison is far too talented to remain only a marvelous reporter of the black side of provincial American life," wrote the critic.
3. She went on a book tour with Muhammad Ali While promoting Ali's book "The Greatest: My Own Story," the two got off to a rocky start. "When I first met him and asked him a question, he would answer and look at a man and never looked directly at me while he was giving the answer. But then I remembered he respects older women," Morrison recalls, saying she realized she should act more like his mother. "So I just crossed my arms as I walked in the room and said, 'Ali, get up from there, you have something to do.' And he would look up and recognize ... a grown-up. And from then on, he did everything I said," she chuckles.
4. Oprah got creative trying to get her phone number After reading "Beloved," Oprah wanted to call Morrison personally, but the famous author's number was unlisted. So the TV star called the fire department and asked for it.
Morrison remembers picking up the phone. "She said, 'Toni Morrison, this is Oprah Winfrey.' I said, 'How did you get my number?' " she laughs. Oprah made her plea to turn "Beloved" into a movie, ultimately convincing a skeptical Morrison.
5. Morrison called time's up on equal pay in the 1970s In her first job, the single mom noticed her male counterparts were getting more money when the raises were given out. "So I went to my boss and I said, 'You didn't raise me as much as my colleagues who are men.' He said. 'Yes, but.' And I said, 'I don't want to hear 'but.' I want to tell you something: I am head of the household. Just. Like. You."
She got the money.
Toni Morrison's life is explored in the new documentary "Toni Morrison: The Pieces I Am."

Artists and Estates Sue Universal Over 2008 Fire
A group of high-profile pop musicians and estates sued the Universal Music Group on Friday over a 2008 fire that destroyed thousands of archived recordings but, according to the lawsuit, was never disclosed to the artists.
The suit was filed in Los Angeles by the bands Soundgarden and Hole, the singer-songwriter Steve Earle and the estates of Tom Petty and Tupac Shakur. It is the first legal fallout from a New York Times Magazine investigation that found that the fire, at a back-lot warehouse at Universal Studios Hollywood, had destroyed over 100,000 audio recordings that contained as many as 500,000 songs.
The suit accuses Universal of breaching its contracts with artists by failing to properly protect the tapes. It also argues that Universal had a duty to share any income received as settlements from the fire, including an insurance payment and a legal settlement. The claim seeks damages in excess of $ 100 million. BEN SISARIO

Mitsubishi Shareholders Vote to Remove Ghosn
Shareholders of the Japanese automaker Mitsubishi approved on Friday the ouster of Carlos Ghosn, who was pivotal in the company's three-way partnership with Nissan and Renault until he was arrested on financial misconduct charges last year
Osamu Masuko, who was reappointed chairman, promised to strengthen governance and transparency and monitor wrongdoing.
Mr. Ghosn, who led Nissan for two decades, saving it from nearbankruptcy, had served as chairman at Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi, and was long a revered figure in the industry.
He has been charged with falsifying financial reports in underreporting retirement compensation and with breach of trust in having Nissan shoulder investment losses and in diverting Nissan money for personal gain. Mr. Ghosn maintains his innocence.
One Mitsubishi Motors shareholder expressed anger over the scandal. But most of the questions were about new models and market strategy. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Delta Buys Stake in Korean Air's Parent
Delta Air Lines bought a small stake in Hanjin Kal, Korean Air's parent company, and said it wanted to increase it to 10 percent, giving a lift to the management of South Korea's top carrier, which seeks to thwart a local activist fund's challenge.
Delta did not disclose how much it paid for the 4.3 percent stake. It also did not say whom it bought the stake from or when it may raise it to 10 percent.
Korean Air, which has had a joint venture with Delta since last year, said on Friday it believed Delta's 4.3 percent stake purchase intends to ensure the "stable management" of the company and support for its leadership.
If Delta raises its stake to 10 percent in Hanjin Kal, the airline's founding family and its allies will have a total stake of 39 percent, versus the 16 percent stake held by the activist fund Korea Corporate Governance Improvement.

'When Will You Leave?' Russian Discontent With Putin Surfaces

Texto completo: MOSCOW -- The discontent thrumming just below the surface in Russia was on clear display Thursday as President Vladimir V. Putin spent the bulk of his annual marathon, televised call-in program trying to convince the country that life was improving.
The president's answers to 75 of the more than 2.6 million questions submitted were perhaps less compelling than the steady stream of text messages popping up on the bottom of the television screen, some of them surprisingly critical.
"You have been in power for longer than Brezhnev," read one, referring to Leonid Brezhnev, whose 18-year rule is remembered as the era of stagnation. "But we continue to live in poverty as we used to live."
"When will serfdom be restored? We're waiting for the lord of the manor who will buy our village and organize jobs."
"Just one question: when will you leave?"
During the 4 hours, 16 minutes of the session, Mr. Putin occasionally interrupted the two anchors curating the questions to respond to the texts, but he skipped the outright negative ones.
His basic message was that he understood that many of Russia's 145 million people were troubled by low wages, uneven medical care and poor infrastructure, but that things were far worse before he came to power in 2000 and, trust him, he's working on it.
"So when are we going to feel the results?" asked one anchor.
"You should start feeling them this year, next year, soon," Mr. Putin responded.
In truth, this was Mr. Putin's 17th such show, and the same problems come up every year. If anything, economic conditions have decayed recently, with real income falling since 2014. He typically scolds a few governors who then scurry to the side of aggrieved citizens, expresses surprise that some teachers earn as little as $ 160 a month and fields a few foreign policy questions.
Mr. Putin was asked to respond to an article in The New York Times this week reporting that the United States had hacked the Russian electric grid as a kind of warning against cyberattacks against the United States.
Russia was bound to take such threats into account, whether the story was confirmed or not, Mr. Putin said. "We need to ensure that this system is safe and sound," he added. "We need to protect it from any attacks, we are not just thinking about it, that is what we are doing."
The annual show, called "Direct Line," has become a repetitive set piece that allows Mr. Putin to play a favorite role: reassuring father to the nation.
"This is the phenomenon of the good czar," said Aleksei V. Makarkin, the deputy president of the Center for Political Technologies, a Moscow-based think tank. "You can turn to him and he might find time, he might solve your issue. In the ancient times, there was a special box near the czar's palace that people could put complaints into."
If there were such a box today, it would be filling up more rapidly than in past years. Things have gotten rocky enough domestically that Mr. Putin has felt compelled to intervene on the side of protesters in at least three separate disputes.
He put on hold plans to build a cathedral in the last prime downtown park in Yekaterinburg, one of Russia's largest cities, and postponed construction on a massive dump for Moscow's garbage in the northern Arkhangelsk province.
In Moscow, after spontaneous street protests, obviously faked drug charges leveled against an investigative journalist, Ivan Golunov, were dropped with uncharacteristic speed, and two senior police generals were fired.
Such unexpected outcomes could reflect concerns in the Kremlin about Mr. Putin's sinking popularity ratings, which have never recovered from a highly unpopular decision to raise the pension age in 2018. That, Mr. Makarkin said, has made the Kremlin more attentive to public opinion.
"The feeling that any decision can be pushed through at any price is fading," he said. "The pension reform was pushed through, but the price was quite high. So today, when the situation concerns questions that are not connected with the fundamental nature of the political regime, the government tries not to irritate people."
As a result, the Kremlin is markedly more willing to intervene on the side of protesters if there are no high-profile opposition figures involved and when the focus is on a local issue.
The president also faces the problem of extending his own rule past 2024, analysts say, when term limits would ordinarily end his time in office.
From a high of about 85 percent following the annexation of Crimea in 2014, Mr. Putin's approval rating has dropped to 66 percent in the latest figures from the Levada Center, an independent pollster.
Handicapping any Kremlin decision involves many theories and much speculation. There is a sense, however, that both the sweeping powers of the security services and the growing role of the church are making even some high-level bureaucrats uneasy.
The feeling that no one was safe became especially acute after a former economy minister, Aleksei V. Ulyukayev, was jailed in 2017 for eight years on bribery charges that many suspected were manufactured.
That sentiment helps explain why the Golunov case erupted into a public outcry against police overreach.
The police officials, who were annoyed by Mr. Golunov's exposure of corruption in Moscow, seemingly blundered in announcing his arrest on fabricated charges on the same day that Mr. Putin was addressing the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, Russia's main international conference for investors. With investor interest already at a low ebb, analysts said, Mr. Putin could not abide such a distraction.
During the call-in show, Mr. Putin answered a question about the case by saying the police should not abuse their powers.
The Yekaterinburg cathedral issue was also about limits, in this case on the state-backed Russian Orthodox Church.
In a country where religious sentiment is weak, there is unease about the church meddling in school curriculums and building churches nobody wants. Patriarch Kirill recently announced that three new churches are opened daily. Stopping the erection of a cathedral in Yekaterinburg -- virtually across the street from another one -- was a popular move.
But the callers on Mr. Putin's Direct Line broadcast knew better than to attack the system or, worse, criticize Mr. Putin directly, since the condition of the country is such a measure of his record.
"They understand pretty well that they should ask the czar for the favor, and if he is kind enough and they are lucky enough, their problems will be fixed," said Nikolai Petrov, a political scientist. "If they do something against his will and they blame him, they will never get their problems fixed."

Texto completo: Un jurado de una corte federal de Nueva York halló este miércoles culpable de todos los cargos a Keith Raniere , fundador de la organización de supuesta autoayuda Nxivm, con sede en Albany, que resultó ser una secta de esclavas y trata sexual.
Tras cinco horas de deliberación, los 12 miembros del jurado establecieron un veredicto condenatorio contra el acusado en el juicio que se extendió por un mes.
Raniere, de 58 años, que está en prisión desde su arresto en México en marzo de 2018, enfrentó juicio por varios delitos, entre ellos tráfico sexual con adultos y menores, posesión de pornografía infantil, explotación sexual de un menor y chantaje. Se enfrenta a una posible cadena perpetua.
Pero, si algo llamó la atención de este caso fueron los detalles bizarros y de índole sexual que trascendieron en la Corte del Distrito Este de Brooklyn. A continuación, te presentamos un resumen:
Tres hermanas mexicanas embarazadas y abortos
Tres hermanas mexicanas abortaron a pedido del líder de la secta Nxivm, Keith Raniere, quien las embarazó mientras eran sus esclavas sexuales.
Una de las víctimas, identificadas como Daniela, narró el martirio que tanto ella como sus hermanas vivieron bajo el abuso de Raniere camuflado en el supuesto grupo de autoayuda.
La joven, quien llegó de México junto a otros seis miembros de su familia cuanto tenía 16 años, además relató que la prepararon durante semanas antes de que cumpliera los 18, para que Raniere tomara su virginidad.
“Nunca me habían besado y no había tenido ningún contacto sexual”, dijo Daniela en el tribunal, según citada por medios como The Daily Beast.
Marcadas como “ganado”
Videos muestran cómo las esclavas sexuales eran marcadas a fuego vivo con un cauterizador como una especie de rito de iniciación.
En una grabación se ve el procedimiento mediante el que “tatuaban” a las mujeres con las iniciales del líder de la secta.
En el clip, presentado en exclusiva en el noticiero de Loret de Mola de Televisa, se aprecia a un grupo de cuatro féminas desnudas en una de estas ceremonias.
Una de ellas está acostada mientras la “tatúan”; se trata de Sarah Edmondson, quien denunció en 2017 las prácticas del grupo a The New York Times.
A Raniere, que camuflaba los abusos como cursos de “autoayuda” bajo “Programas de Éxito Ejecutivo”, se le ve en el video pronunciando una especie de juramento que las mujeres a su vez deben repetir.

La “Semana de la vanguardia”
Otro detalle atroz que trascendió en el proceso judicial fue la celebración conocida como “Semana de la vanguardia”, en reconocimiento a Raniere, evento que supuestamente congregaba a miembros de varias ciudades de Estados Unidos y Canadá.
El encuentro, relacionado con el cumpleaños de Raniere el 26 de agosto, reflejaba la idolatría de los participantes de la organización a su líder y estaba dirigido a la satisfacción de las demandas de éste.
El agente especial del FBI Michael Lever dijo en una declaración jurada que Raniere tenía una rotación de 15 a 20 mujeres con las que mantenía relaciones sexuales como parte de las actividades.
Manipulación y soborno con material sexual
La sociedad secreta piramidal llamada “DOS” o el “Voto” a Nxivm era otra humillación a las víctimas en beneficio del líder.
Raniere, el único miembro masculino del grupo, ocupaba el nivel más alto, en su papel de “maestro superior”. A su vez, las primeras esclavas reclutaban a otras.
Para unirse, las mujeres se veían obligadas a dar garantías de fidelidad a sus amos: material sería comprometedor para la mujer que se exponía a este trueque.
Podría tratarse de fotografías y videos sexualmente explícitos de las esclavas.
“Las esclavas entendían que si abandonaban el DOS, hablaban públicamente sobre el DOS o repetidamente incumplían las obligaciones o asignaciones del DOS, sus garantías podían ser publicadas”, expuso Lever.
.
Sexo grupal
Lauren Salzman, una de las mujeres que pertenecía al círculo cercano de Keith Raniere y la actriz de Smallville Allison Mack, confesaron haber aceptado participar – como dos de las siete “esclavas de primera línea”- en una ceremonia de compromiso que incluía sexo oral grupal.
Poco antes de que comenzara la ceremonia en marzo del 2018, los agentes mexicanos rodearon la propiedad de Raniere en una villa en las afueras de Puerto Vallarta (Jalisco) y lo arrestaron . En dicho país se extendieron las redes de este grupo con vínculos con altos líderes como Emiliano Salinas, hijo del expresidente Carlos Salinas.

Texto completo: The red Russian hardwood trunks with silver bracketing and removable wheels may not look like much, but inside they're packed with adventure and could revolutionize the way students learn. These red trunks are a product of the Red Trunk Project, a program focused on teaching kids about different cultures around the world. While the trunks are literally red, the "red" also stands for "respect every difference."
"The goal is to give kids a deep immersion into one culture and once they do that, they'll have the tools to uncode any other cultures they interact with throughout their life," said the project's founder, Rockland resident Kevin Thomsen.
"Learn to reach out a hand instead of a fist; to build bridges, not walls."
A producer of video games, toys, shows, ebooks and audiobooks who holds a gold record and a couple of Grammys, Thomsen is also a father of two.
"I have two adopted children, one from the Republic of Georgia, Penelope, and Sefan, from Ethiopia," Thomsen said. "For the past 17 years, the idea of keeping kids close to the culture of their birth has stuck with me. How do you introduce kids to a culture without going there? What's the best way to do this?"
The answer: trunks filled with artifacts, video, virtual reality goggles and a booklet.
Teaching through trunks isn't a new concept, but Thomsen wanted to expand on the idea and hyper-focus on a whole country and its culture, as opposed to a moment in history.
"There are people who do trunk-based kinds of things," Thomsen said, "but it's typically one trunk filled with something like Vietnam memorabilia."
Road to Red Trunks The idea came to Thomsen during an audiobook recording session for "A Path Appears," a book written by New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof and his wife, Sheryl WuDunn. The book profiles charities around the world and found a new way to measure their success.
After a conversation with actress Olivia Wilde, who was recording the book, a light bulb went off in Thomsen's head.
"I was like 'I want to record the stories of children from different countries around the world,'" Thomsen said. "The differences in each other is what makes life interesting."
The idea sat with him for a couple of years and morphed into the Red Trunk Project after his wife suggested reaching out to a friend to discuss the particulars.
"The idea of kids trading stories," Thomsen said, "became cultural artifacts, or maybe some video, that kids can touch and feel."
Once the project launched, two years later, Thomsen reached out to Kristof to tell him.
"Sheryl and I are thrilled to see what Kevin has done with the Red Trunk Project and to watch how it has grown," Kristof said. "It's just the kind of project that opens and nourishes young minds."
"He's been a great supporter, he even mentioned us in his newsletter," "Thomsen said of Kristof's support.
The first Red Trunk centers on Oaxaca, Mexico.
Thomsen approached Dr. Jill Vexler, a cultural anthropologist who has curated more than 40 exhibitions, through a mutual friend. Vexler, who spend years living in Mexico, reached out to another cultural anthropologist who was living in Mexico. With minimal conversation, they came up with identical lists for what artifacts must be in the trunks. Thomsen made three trips to Oaxaca to collect the artifacts, photos and video from the lists.
"It's a particularly cultural area," Vexler said of Oaxaca. " I wanted to show American kids how daily life solutions are solving the same problems just in different places.The artifacts and material culture of these solutions is very different and the tech to make the material culture is very different."
Michele Purpura, a third grade teacher at Brookside Elementary School in the Yorktown Central School District, had a Red Trunk visit her classroom this school year.
"For me, this was an unbelievable opportunity. The Red Trunk touched upon one of my favorite themes — acceptance," Purpura said. "I cannot explain how excited by students were during this project. They truly appreciated the artifacts, especially after viewing the videos."
The Red Trunk has visited school districts on Long Island, in Eastchester and Newburgh, in Orange County, and Thomsen said he is focusing on getting into more schools in Westchester, Rockland, Putnam, Orange and Dutchess.
"We're aiming for one trunk per classroom for a two-week period," Thomsen said. "We're putting as many artifacts we can fit in the trunks with video and the 'Kids of Oaxaca' booklet. There are about 60 artifacts per trunk and we want to make hundreds of trunks to share with the world."
The next Red Trunks may focus on Kenya or China. Thomsen is in talks with the Heard Museum in Phoenix, Arizona, about a Native American trunk. He is also in talks with Rockland Pride about creating a rainbow trunk which would take a look at the history of the gay civil rights movement.
"It's about activism," Thomsen said. "We want kids to get active to help the environment whether on a micro or macro level. Recycling in their homes is a micro thing that can make a big difference."
'Mad Men' actor is helping the cause
On Thursday, the Red Trunk Project is holding a fundraiser called "Red Trunk Liftoff." There will be food, wine, a mystery raffle and an auction run by comedian Richard Kind.
What would be auctioned off to help a project such as this? How about enjoying 30 minutes of cocktail banter via Skype with "Mad Men" star Jon Hamm, who is also on the Red Trunk Project's board of directors, or the opportunity to take a two-hour boat ride via Nyack Boat Charters, complete with a picnic provided by Mimi's Plate?
"What Kevin and his team have done with Red Trunk is provide a unique cross-cultural experiential toolset to inspire a new generation of minds to understand different cultures first hand," Hamm said in a release. "To lead with acceptance and understanding and not fear is a valuable concept in today's increasingly polarized and fractured conversation. I am proud to support Red Trunk and hope to make its reach even wider and more significant."
The money raised at the Red Trunk Liftoff will be matched 3 to 1 to raise even more funds for the Red Trunk Project.
Go: Red Trunk Liftoff, OUTSIDE IN Gallery, 249 Ferdon Ave., Piermont. June 13, 6-9 p.m. $75 per person. To register for the event head to eventbrite.com/e/red-trunk-liftoff-tickets.

Texto completo: The economy, evidently, is growing at a good pace. According to The Wall Street Journal (May 15), this growth came at the cost of an exploding federal budget deficit, environmental degradation and reduced protections for workers, consumers and the poor.
What about the astronomical costs from extreme weather caused by climate change? How much is covered by insurance? Who is calculating the costs and are they being figured into the economic indicators? If not, why not?
Between 1980 and spring 2019, the U.S. sustained 246 weather and climate disasters where the costs and damages exceeded $1 billion (adjusted to the 2019 consumer price index). Total cost of these 246 events exceeds $1.6 trillion. For example, the cost of the 2017 hurricanes was $268 billion and of the 2017 California wildfires at least $9 billion. What about the costs of human misery, home loss, rescue costs, property, human lives?
What about damage to other nations from U.S. greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning? Are we contributing to sea level rise on Pacific islands, Bangladesh and other vulnerable regions? Melting ice caps and glaciers, rising sea levels, massive flooding, the list goes on and on.
Is the cost of reducing heat-trapping greenhouse gases and reining in climate change so high that it exceeds the billions of dollars in damages? For the first time in recorded history, carbon dioxide (the major greenhouse gas) levels hit 414.7 parts per million on May 25, at Mauna Loa Observatory on Hawaii, where consistent records have been kept since 1958.
What about the impact on worldwide human health and expected increases in insect-borne diseases? According to the Guardian U.S. Edition (June 3) Sir Andrew Haines, co-chair of a report for European Academies' Science Advisory Council, said, "There are impacts occurring now [and], over the coming century, climate change has to be ranked as one of the most serious threats to health."
As an environmental scientist, I have taught about climate change for over 20 years. Global warming has been mentioned in peer-reviewed environmental science textbooks at least since 1996. The science is very strong and supported by over 95% of all international climate scientists. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (climate scientists from all over the world, supported by the United Nations and the World Meteorological Organization) stated in their most recent report that it is extremely likely (a plus 95% probability) that emissions of heat-trapping gases from human activities have caused "most of the observed increase in globally averaged temperatures since the mid-20th century." The panel continues "emissions are primarily [from] burning fossil fuels and secondarily by land use changes (e.g. forest /vegetation loss)."
The peer-reviewed U.S. National Climate Assessment (NCA4 2017, from over 200 U.S. climate scientists), states, "The last few years have also seen record-breaking, climate-related weather extremes, and the last three years have been the warmest years on record for the globe." This assessment concludes, based on extensive scientific evidence, "that it is extremely likely that human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse gases, are the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century ... there is no convincing alternative explanation supported by the extent of the observational evidence."
Concerned and thoughtful Americans are insisting that U.S. states and cities implement the agreements of the Paris Accord, where 195 nations agreed to curtail greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide. The accord is a remarkable international treaty to reduce damages from climate change. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon stated, "For the first time, we have a truly universal agreement on climate change, one of the most crucial problems on earth."
The New York Times reiterates that climate change is "the most important story in the world." Even though the current administration withdrew from the Paris Accord, fortunately the U.S. Climate Alliance (14 states representing over one-third of the country's population) and many cities and municipalities have agreed to implement the essential reductions in the Paris Accord.
There is hope that the United States will stop fiddling while Planet Earth burns.

Texto completo: What's Streaming
THE EDGE OF DEMOCRACY (2019) Stream on Netflix. In this documentary, the filmmaker Petra Costa grapples with and chronicles the triumph of left-wing politics -- and then authoritarian politics -- in Brazil. From the perspective of the present, she covers the presidencies and eventual falls of the left-leaning Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and Dilma Rousseff and the rise of Brazil's current president, the outspoken populist Jair Bolsonaro. "Though she is a scrupulous and dogged digger-up of hidden facts and a thoughtful interpreter of public events, Costa hasn't produced a work of objective journalism or detached historical scholarship so much as a personal reckoning with her nation's past and present," A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times. "The facts and arguments she communicates should be studied by anyone interested in the fate of democracy," he noted, "in Brazil or anywhere else."
RIVIERA Stream on Sundance Now. What would you do if your billionaire husband was blown up on a Russian yacht? Most of us probably won't ever have to answer the question. But that is the circumstance that Georgina, a Midwestern expat and art dealer played by Julia Stiles, found herself in at the beginning of Season 1 of this series, which was created by Neil Jordan. Georgina's response was to wade into a seedy, big-money underworld looking for answers. She continues her plunge Season 2. The series "has all the ingredients of the international melo-thriller," Mike Hale recently wrote inThe Times, "and because it's a Neil Jordan project, it's more voluptuous than most (if no more coherent or plausible)."
STRANGE ANGEL Stream on CBS All Access. Rockets, World War II-era America and a sex magic cult: these are the ingredients that fuel "Strange Angel," a series based on the life of Jack Parsons, a Southern California rocket engineer who was behind technological breakthroughs in the years surrounding World War II -- and also had an interest in the occult. The second season kicked off last week.
What's on TV
WAR DOGS (2016) 8 p.m. on AMC. Jonah Hill and Miles Teller play buffoonish weapons dealers in this comic drama, based on actual events, in which a pair of young American men improbably became arms suppliers to the United States military. While the world the men enter is one of Pentagon contracts and war zones, the director of this version of the tale is Todd Phillips, known for "The Hangover." The fact that the movie is based on a true story "proves conclusively that truth is stranger than fiction," Neil Genzlinger wrote in his review for The Times.

Texto completo: How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Anna Dubenko, editor of off-platform strategy, discussed the tech she's using.
Tell us a bit about your role as an editor of off-platform strategy. What does off-platform mean, and what does it involve?
We use the term off-platform to mean all the places where readers could encounter our journalism outside the Times app and website. It's a way of orienting ourselves to be empathetic to the way readers consume news and spend their time online.
This means I spend my days thinking about how to make our journalism work on platforms like Apple News, Instagram, LinkedIn and Pocket. I try to put myself in readers' shoes to figure out how best to make our stories match what they're looking for.
Are they looking to unwind with a great long read from the magazine over the weekend? Perhaps Flipboard can help us reach those readers. Do they want to hear directly about a journalist's experience reporting a story? A Reddit AMA is the way to go. It's all about recognizing that not everyone comes directly to nytimes.com.
What tech tools are important to do your work?
What's fun about my job is that I have to play around and investigate various platforms all day. This means that when I have my LinkedIn home page open on my desktop, I can honestly tell my boss that it's for work.
Same goes for Instagram. I've been involved in rethinking our Instagram strategy, which means that I get to swipe through other publishers' Stories for competitive research. I'm very impressed, for instance, with what Politico is doing on Instagram. It's clear that whoever is running that account gets whom the platform is for (young people) and how to make Politico journalism relevant to their lives.
What are some emerging tech platforms or tools that you think will become prominent channels for media outlets to disseminate stories?
I'm very bullish on LinkedIn, especially for publishers like The Times. We want to reach readers who are looking for stories to help them be better at their jobs and more knowledgeable about their industry. LinkedIn helps us reach those readers, often in really targeted ways.
Recently, for example, LinkedIn editors sent a story by Karen Weise, one of our tech reporters, about Amazon workers pushing the company to be more climate conscious to everyone on the platform who worked for Amazon. As an audience editor, I found that really exciting.
In the same vein, I'm really curious about how we can use Slack to reach this same kind of reader. Professional people are staring at Slack all day long and sharing stories relevant to work (also stories not relevant to work, but that their colleagues may find entertaining).
It's the "dark social" of 2019, and I'm excited to crack the code. I'm thinking of it as a first step on our path to figuring out how The Times should be distributed on other messaging platforms like WhatsApp and Line.
What advice would you give to aspiring writers who are trying to get exposure for their work online?
This is a no-brainer. Every writer should know where his or her readers are and how best to reach them. Owning your distribution channels is the single most important thing a writer can do to reach the right audience. Moreover, it helps when you're speaking to an audience that can, in return, generate story ideas and give you tips.
Practically, this means figuring out which communities on Reddit are talking about your beat. Or being aware of which Facebook groups are most active in your area of coverage. Most writers are already on Twitter, and they probably should be. Twitter is an important place to reach other writers and to network. But if you want to build a readership, you need to know where your noninfluencer readers spend their time.
What tech products do you love outside your job?
I love my Arlo baby monitor. I have two kids (3 and 1), and it's one of the few video monitors that allow me to access both feeds on my phone. It was one of Wirecutter's picks. It also does all sorts of fancy stuff like monitor the temperature and humidity of the kids' rooms.
It's really accurate. Once, when I was putting my older daughter to bed, one of us passed gas. I thought it would go unnoticed until my husband came upstairs. The Arlo had alerted him to an "air quality" issue in my older daughter's room.
I'm also obsessed with TikTok. Every night, before I go to bed, I open the app and promise myself that I'll watch only two or three short videos. Thirty minutes later, I'm in a wormhole of "rich boy checks" and D.I.Y. boy bands. It's the last joyful place on the internet, and I'm just trying to savor it before it becomes a toxic wasteland.

Texto completo: Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, asked the Treasury Department's inspector general on Wednesday to open an investigation into delayed design concepts of a new $ 20 note featuring the image of Harriet Tubman that were set to be unveiled next year.
The Trump administration has faced backlash after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that design concepts of a $ 20 bill featuring Tubman would not be released next year and that the new note might not even include her when it does come into circulation, most likely in 2030.
The New York Times revealed last week that design work on a $ 20 bill featuring Tubman's portrait had started before President Trump took office and extended into last year, leading to questions about whether the note was being stalled for political reasons.
In a letter to the inspector general, Mr. Schumer noted that the Empire State Building was constructed in a little more than a year and expressed doubt that it should take the Treasury Department more than a decade to roll out a new $ 20 bill.
"We do not know the real reason for these decisions, but we do know that during his campaign, President Trump referred to efforts to replace President Jackson's likeness on the front of the $ 20 note as 'pure political correctness,"' Mr. Schumer wrote. "Secretary Mnuchin attempted to explain the delay as necessary to accommodate anti-counterfeiting measures, but it is simply not credible that with all the resources and expertise of the U.S. Treasury and Secret Service, a decade or more could be required to produce a new $ 20 bill."
Mr. Schumer added that unnecessary delays of the new note, especially for political reasons, are "improper and unacceptable."
Rich Delmar, Treasury's acting inspector general, said in an email that he was reviewing the request.
A former slave and abolitionist, Tubman had ties to the state of New York, having moved her family to Auburn, N.Y., from Canada in 1857.
In 2016, Jacob J. Lew, President Barack Obama's final Treasury secretary, announced after soliciting public feedback that Tubman would replace Andrew Jackson on the front of the $ 20 and that a smaller image of Jackson, a former slave holder, would be moved to the back of the bill. Under a timeline set forth by Mr. Lew, design concepts of the new bill were scheduled to be released in 2020, on the 100th anniversary of women gaining the right to vote.
In May, Mr. Mnuchin said at a congressional hearing that the design imagery of the bill would not be ready until 2026 because of the complexity of creating new anti-counterfeiting measures. He would not commit to Tubman ever appearing on its face and said that a future Treasury secretary would make that decision.
Mr. Mnuchin has denied delaying the process and said in a statement last week that Treasury and the Bureau of Engraving and Printing remain committed to the schedule of new $ 20 notes going into circulation by 2030.
Len Olijar, the director of the bureau, said that, for security reasons, design concepts of a new $ 20 note were never going to be released next year and that "everything remains on the table" regarding whose portrait will be on the new bill. Mr. Olijar said that the image of a $ 20 note that The Times obtained featuring Tubman's portrait, which was created by the bureau, was not an advanced design concept.
After Mr. Trump took office, the Treasury Department removed from its website all mentions of Tubman or the planned changes to the $ 20, $ 10 and $ 5 notes that the Obama administration set in motion. Mr. Mnuchin had said little on the subject until he was pressed about it during a House Financial Services Committee hearing last month.
The delay of the new design has prompted calls for the Trump administration to follow through in adding Tubman to the note and bipartisan legislation in the House that would require the Treasury Department to do so next year.
Requests from Congress for inspector general inquiries do tend to yield responses. Mr. Mnuchin's department has faced internal investigations into the secretary's travel practices and into his handling of an analysis of the Republican tax cut legislation. The inquiry into Mr. Mnuchin's air travel found he broke no laws in his use of military aircraft but lamented the loose justification provided for such costly flights. The tax cut analysis investigation found no evidence of any improper political interference with the career tax staff.
Mr. Schumer is asking for a review into the interagency process for the new $ 20 note, including input from the White House, the Secret Service and the Federal Reserve, to ensure that "political considerations have not been allowed to infect the process for designing American currency."
The Treasury Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Junge: Finding lessons in "Sleepy Hollow"

Texto completo: Editor’s note: This is the fifth in a series of articles by Mark Junge, a 76-year-old Cheyenneite who is oxygen-dependent. He and his wife, Ardath, are riding their electric-assist bicycles along New York’s Erie Canal Trail.
If ever I should wish for a retreat whither I might steal from the world and its distractions, and dream quietly away the remnant of a troubled life, I know of none more promising than this little valley. – Diedrich Knickerbocker in “The Legend of Sleepy Hollow” by Washington Irving
We’re at a KOA campground north of Herkimer, New York. It is Sunday, and we have taken a day off from our bicycle labors along the Erie Canal. Ardath sits opposite me in our camper/pickup, watching a movie on her iPad while I compose this week’s offering to you, Dear Reader.
Occasionally, I glance over her shoulder to gaze hypnotically at West Canada Creek, a trout stream about 30 feet away from where we’re parked. Its headwaters are rivulets in the Adirondack Mountains to the north, but at this point, the “creek” is as wide as the Snake River flowing through Jackson Hole.
Surrounding us is a landscape made famous by Washington Irving in his book “The Legend of Sleepy Hollow” – a green mansion of hardwood trees, shrubbery and grass, and a blue-green river that contrasts with the slow-moving, cream-in-your-coffee, straight-as-a-railroad, channel of the Erie Canal. This vacation tuckaway is part of an upstate region of New York made famous by the Hudson River School of painters like Albert Bierstadt, whose paintings, such as “Yellowstone Falls,” can be seen at the Buffalo Bill Center of the West in Cody.
Between Rome – where the canal began – and Utica is a less-traveled, less majestic strip of canal trail where, at one point, I had to push my Haibike through a fallen tree in order to continue pedaling the two-track path through the woods and past swampland opposite the canal. The bike path here cuts through primeval woodland and luxuriant vegetation inhabited by birds whose calls are not as familiar as the robins in the yard of our Cheyenne home.
The swamp, I presume, is an older and narrower channel of the canal that contains no boats, is clogged with trees and algae, and inhabited by turtles and fish. It is not a place Ardath wants to ride but – despite the few mosquitoes that hover around the louvers in my helmet – I love the wildness. It deserves a quote from “The Legend of Sleepy Hollow:” “There is a serene and settled majesty to woodland scenery that enters into the soul and delights and elevates it, and fills it with noble inclinations.”
If you read the postscript to last week’s chapter in this bicycling saga, you are aware that Ardath and I planned to visit Medina, South Greece, Egypt, Macedon and Palmyra. It took just a few days to visit all of them, and by the time you read this, we also will have passed through Rome, Peru, Jordan, Memphis and other exotic locations including … Weedsport.
That’s right, Weedsport is just one of many towns along the Erie Canal whose names end in “port.” These once-bustling villages, where western farm products were loaded onto barges headed east and eastern manufactured goods were offloaded at canal ports, are today small towns or simply the names of intersections in the canal path. Some canal town main streets display vintage brick buildings, and occasionally the waterfront is dotted with restaurants, gift shops and small museums.
So … there’ s Orangeport, Gasport, Middleport, Lockport, Brockport, Spencerport, Fairport, Waynesport and Centerport. Kinda sounds like “Singin’ Cowboy” Hank Snow’s version of “I’ve Been Everywhere, Man.” Tom Martin, a locktender at Palmyra, who also sings and plays guitar, is working on a version of that song, which includes all the stops along the canal. He warbled it for us without an omission … at least, as far as we know.
South of Palmyra is the Joseph Smith farm and Sacred Grove where tour guide Elder Guthrie led us to the original and reconstructed buildings on the Smith farm. He ended his personal tour by encouraging us to walk the path through the Sacred Grove where, somewhere, in an unspecified place of this quiet, green-forest, Joseph Smith was inspired to establish the Mormon Church.
The LDS Church was born during a period of 19th-century religious and social fervor in western New York, an area historians label as the “Burned-over” district. It was a seedbed for Christian revivalism, the women’s suffrage and temperance movements, abolitionism, utopianism and a radical vegetarianism characterized by a cracker named for Presbyterian minister, Sylvester Graham.
Stimulating this cosmopolitanism was the Erie Canal, a channel for communication of ideas, as well as boat traffic. For settlers from New England and immigrants from other countries, it was a type of “Yellow Brick Road.” It should come as no surprise, then, that one Erie Canal port town, Chittenango, was the birthplace of L. Frank Baum, the author of “The Wizard of Oz.”
Because Ardath and I have access to the internet, we are aware of the controversy over the printing of Harriet Tubman’s image on the U.S. $20 bill. Her home, located in Auburn not far from the canal, is a National Historic Landmark. Tubman was an abolitionist and “female Moses” of the Underground Railroad. Prior to the Civil War, she guided hundreds of slaves to freedom in Canada.
Tubman was also a suffragist, although black women like her and black men like Frederick Douglas were not allowed by white folks to lead the movement. Nineteenth century white women, including Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, did not advocate rights for black women, using them when it became convenient to do so.
According to New York Times editorialist Brent Staples, we should be careful to not overstate the upcoming celebration of the 19th Amendment that gave women the right to vote. He cautions: It covered the needs of middle-class white women quite nicely. But it meant very little to black women in the South, where most lived at the time and where election officials were well practiced in the art of obstructing black access to the ballot box.
More anon.

'He is out of step': Backlash after Biden talks 'civility' with segregationist senators

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Former Vice President Joe Biden reflected Tuesday on the "civility" that existed between himself and segregationist senators early in his career in an effort to present himself as a bipartisan consensus-maker.
The 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, who has found himself a front-runner in recent polls, drew criticism for the remarks.
Speaking at a fundraiser at the ritzy Carlyle Hotel in New York, Biden talked about his ability to "(get) things done" with former Senators James Eastland of Mississippi and Herman Talmadge of Georgia, according to a campaign pool report. The two segregationist Democrats fought against the civil rights movement and opposed the racial integration of schools. Biden's first term in the Senate, which started in 1973, overlapped with the tenures of the two men.
Biden also lamented a political climate that would not allow for similar "consensus" today.
"I know the new New Left tells me that I’m — this is old-fashioned," he said. "Well guess what? If we can’t reach a consensus in our system, what happens? It encourages and demands the abuse of power by a president. That’s what it does. You have to be able to reach consensus under our system — our Constitutional system of separation of powers. ”

Biden then went on to cite his relationships with Eastland and Talmadge as examples of people who "didn't agree on much of anything" but "got things done. "
“I was in a caucus with James O. Eastland,” said Biden, reportedly imitating Eastland's southern drawl. “He never called me 'boy,' he always called me 'son. '” Talmadge, he said, was "one of the meanest guys I ever knew. "
But according to Biden, despite these differences, "At least there was some civility. We got things done. We didn’t agree on much of anything. We got things done. We got it finished. But today, you look at the other side and you’re the enemy. Not the opposition, the enemy. We don't talk to each other anymore. ”
Eastland and Talmadge were ardent segregationists. After Brown v. Board of Education was decided by the Supreme Court in 1954, according to a 2007 Atlantic article, Eastland said that "the Southern institution of racial segregation or racial separation was the correct, self-evident truth which arose from the chaos and confusion of the Reconstruction period. Separation promotes racial harmony. It permits each race to follow its own pursuits, and its own civilization. Segregation is not discrimination"
Journalist Paul Mayhew, describing Talmadge in a 1956 New Republic article, said, "No Senator from the South is so well equipped or so zealous to become the head and front of a sustained fight for segregation. "
Biden's comments, once reported on by the Washington Post, drew outrage online. Connie Schultz, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist who is married to Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, slammed Biden for his comments.
"There is no punchline here, no emoji or funny meme to soften the harm of your words. That segregationist never called you 'boy' because you are white. If you want to boast about your relationship with a racist, you are not who we need to succeed the racist in the White House," Schultz wrote.
Jamelle Bouie, a New York Times opinion columnist, noted that "it may have been necessary to work with segregationists but there’s nothing laudable about it. "
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democratic presidential candidate, weighed in as well, calling Biden "out of step" with the modern Democratic Party.
"It’s 2019 & @JoeBiden is longing for the good old days of 'civility' typified by James Eastland,'" wrote de Blasio.

Dads say they get shamed, too. Like moms, they feel the sting of 'you're doing it wrong'

Texto completo: Mommy shaming is practically a national pastime. Moms are judged for their choices in clothing, returning to work, breastfeeding, their post-birth bodies, and their children's diets and extracurricular activities.
Dads have had it a ton easier, right? Not so fast, says a new poll.
More than half (52%) of dads reported to C. S. Mott Children's Hospital National that they, too, have been shamed. For moms, it's 60% but still that's a lot of dad shaming going on.
“I think there was a sense that it was a mom phenomenon,” Sarah Clark, co-director of the poll on children’s health at the University of Michigan, told the New York Times. “This poll shows it’s really not. ”
What are dads shamed for?
The poll asked a national sample of dads with children ages 0-13 about perceptions of their parenting.
Of the 52 percent of dads who said they were dinged for not parenting right, the study authors said that traditional gender roles may have been the reason.
"In some instances, this may be a reflection of historical gender roles, where mothers are viewed as more natural caregivers, and fathers as having limited parenting capabilities that need supervision or correction. When this occurs, minor differences in parenting style can cause conflict over the 'best' way to parent. "
More reasons fathers were criticized:
67% how they discipline
43% how they feed their child
32% for being too rough with their child
32% not paying attention to their child
24% over a child's sleep habits
23% over a child's appearance
19% over a child's safety
Who's shaming?
Fathers don't have to look too far to find the biggest shamers. Many times, the criticism comes from the moms or from the child's other parent. Dad's recalled that:
44% came from the child's other parent
24% came from the child's grandparents
10% came from strangers in public places or online
9% came from the father's friends
5% came from teachers or health care providers
All this shaming led some dads to say they felt less confident as a parent (28%) or worse, wanted to be less-involved parents (19%).
Some good news
The poll did find that almost half (49%) of dads took those knocks on their parenting and said they made a positive change.
Another 40% of dads said they sought out advice or information on the topic for which they were shamed.
Study authors said family members should be prepared that dads may come back at them armed with the facts that they were doing it right all along.
"In some cases, new information might prompt a change in parenting behavior, but in others, the father may find confirmation of his approach," they wrote. "Mothers, co-parents, and other family members should be willing to acknowledge that different parenting styles are not necessarily incorrect or harmful. "

Texto completo: Before the disease struck, Mike Deeley was all about being an athlete. A former semi-pro football player and accomplished powerlifter, Deeley spent a decade on the pitch with the local Roses Rugby team through 2016.
“Since I was a teenager, I’ve always done something athletic. It’s ingrained in me,” Deeley said. “I’ve always been in the gym. That’s part of who I am, what I am.”
It’s no surprise then how Deeley has attacked life since it threw him a curveball on Dec. 15, 2016, six days before his 47th birthday. It’s then he was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS.
“You got to break yourself down to a point where you don’t think you can keep on going,” he said. “And then figure out mentally that you can.”
It’s why he says he doesn’t “let the disease dictate how I live my life.”
For instance, the disease has taken away Deeley’s career as a computer engineer in which he previously worked in information technology for the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation.
But he fills that time now as a volunteer for the ALS Association Greater Philadelphia Chapter, meeting with legislators in Washington, D.C., and Harrisburg, pushing for more funding not only for research of the disease but also for assistance for those stricken by the disease.
Deeley, a Warwick High School alum, detailed those efforts in a LNP In The Spotlight Q&A back in December.
ALS made headlines with the Ice Bucket Challenges that became popular five summers ago, which raised $115 million by 2016, according to a report in the New York Times.
Also referred to as Lou Gehrig’s disease, ALS involves the progressive degeneration of the motor neurons, where the ability of the brain to initiate and control muscle movement is lost, eventually leading to losing the ability to speak, eat, move and breathe, according to ALS Association website.
“It’s a gradual onset of paralysis,” Deeley said.
The onset
Roughly 30,000 people currently have the disease, with more than 5,600 newly diagnosed each year. The average life expectancy of a person with ALS is two to five years from the time of diagnosis. Though the rate of decline of a person with ALS often varies.
“It’s all so different for every single person,” Deeley said. “So it’s hard to define a path.”
Deeley’s path took a turn two months ago, when he begrudgingly gave up a walker for a motorized electric wheelchair to which he’s now confined. It’s a circumstance he knew would come eventually, but one he’d been attempting to keep at bay.
“I was walking without a cane longer than most people (with the disease) would,” Deeley said. “I was walking with a cane longer than most people would. I was walking with a walker longer than most people would be able to.”
“He wants to challenge himself to maintain the highest level of physical independence he can do,” said Adam Hawk, a former Roses’ teammate of Deeley’s. “Just seeing him fight to maintain that physicality and challenge himself ... it’s inspiring. I think about the little things that happen in my life, then I look at Deeley and he’s got the best attitude.”
The struggles
That doesn’t mean Deeley, 49, hasn’t had dark days. The hardest part of the last few months, Deeley said, “It’s more than just this chair.”
“The chair is an obvious. It’s the overall breakdown of my body. It’s not being able to use my hands. Hands and legs both getting weaker,’’ he said. “It’s approaching a point of needing somebody to do just about everything.”
A father to a 27-year-old daughter from a previous marriage, Deeley lives in a two-story West Hempfield Township home with his wife and 13-year-old stepson. A first-floor bedroom was recently constructed as an addition to the side of the home, along with a handicap-accessible bathroom.
Automatic door- and cabinet-openers have also been installed, aiding Deeley as his ability to grip objects declines.
“I need help getting toothpaste out of the tube,” he said. “But I can brush using an electric toothbrush.”
A small ramp has replaced steps that go from the home into a now-empty garage where Deeley previously spent countless hours tinkering on a 1971 brown Corvette before he lost the ability to drive. He has given the car to a friend.
He gets around now in a modified van, sometimes driven by his father, Fred Deeley, a 71-year-old retired truck driver who takes his son to medical checkups or out to lunch at their favorite restaurants.
Fortunately for Mike Deeley, who was an aviation electrician in the Navy from 1988 to 1992, all of his medical care has been covered by the Veterans’ Affairs Office.
“But I advocate for the people who are not in my situation,” Deeley said. “I know there are others who are not so lucky.”
Raising funds, awareness
This Saturday, the Roses Rugby club is hosting a golf tournament at Highlands of Donegal Golf Course in Mount Joy. This is the fourth year the club is hosting the event.
Each of the last two years, the club split the proceeds of the event with the ALS Association, giving the group roughly $3,000 each year. This year, all the proceeds raised at the event will go to the ALS Association. Deeley is hoping the event raises more than $6,000.
While foursomes for the event are already booked full, anyone interested in stopping by to make a donation can do so from 7 a.m. to 1 p.m.
Donations can also be made online by clicking here.
“There’s only 30,000 people listed in the country who have this disease,” he said. “But that’s such an erroneous number because that’s the number of people who have it, not the total number of people who have had it. Every 90 minutes somebody gets the disease and every 90 minutes somebody dies from it.”

Daily on Healthcare, presented by the Alzheimer’s Association: Politicians admit to mental health struggles

POLITICIANS ADMIT TO MENTAL HEALTH STRUGGLES: Presidential candidate Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., and Sen. Tina Smith, D-Minn., recently delivered confessions that are rare for members of Congress: They once struggled with and were treated for mental health conditions, he for post-traumatic stress disorder and she for depression.
Discussing such problems out loud is a gamble in politics, and over the years few others in Congress have been forthcoming, but the chances are high that a number of politicians have faced mental health problems. An estimated 47 million people in the U.S. in any given year struggle with conditions such as anxiety or depression, according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness.
Among the members of Congress who have shared their diagnoses are Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., who started speaking openly about his PTSD after he was elected in 2014, and former Rep. Lynn Rivers, D-Mich., who shared in 1994 that she was successfully being medicated for bipolar disorder.
"There certainly are more than three or four national legislators who have problems, and I’m sure that there are many who suffer silently because they worry about political backlash," said Darrell West, vice president and director of governance studies at the Brookings Institution.
Politicians who don't seek treatment for mental illness have struggled to keep up with the demands of their careers. Last year, Democrat Jason Kander had to drop out of the Kansas City mayoral race to focus on treatment for PTSD. Former Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., D-Ill., resigned from Congress in 2012, saying he needed to focus on treatment for bipolar disorder, in addition to the federal investigation into his misuse of campaign money, for which he later pleaded guilty. The late Rep. Karen McCarthy, D-Mo., sought treatment in 2003 after she fell down in a House office building while drunk, and her family revealed after she died that she had bipolar disorder that had gone undiagnosed.
Psychiatrists interviewed for my latest magazine story agreed that most people with mental health conditions who get treatment can do well, but noted that often people don't seek help because they're worried about how they'll be perceived. As a result, their condition can get worse.
For politicians, there's always the risk that seeing a therapist or taking an antidepressant will become a liability if it gets out. Just this week, presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., told Axios he had suffered from depression after returning from a deployment in Afghanistan.

MAJORITY OF DEMOCRATS DON’T UNDERSTAND MEDICARE FOR ALL: POLL: While 87% of Democratic voters want Democratic presidential candidates to discuss healthcare, more than half are unaware that private insurance would no longer be an option under the Medicare-for-all bills introduced by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash. A new Kaiser Family Foundation poll shows 71% of Democrats believe they would still pay deductibles and copays under a national health plan, and 65% think they could keep their private plans. On the other hand, 42% of Republican voters think that they would be able to keep private plans.
Separately, the poll indicates that Obamacare’s favorability has dipped below half over the past two years: Only 46% like it as-is. However, almost 80% of Democrats are in favor of the current law.
Another poll bolsters KFF findings: A separate Navigator poll released Monday shows even more Democrats — 73% — believe anyone can buy a Medicare plan if they want to instead of keeping a private plan under Medicare-for-all proposals. However, less than half of all voters favor getting rid of all private insurance, the bedrock of a national health plan.
HEALTHCARE AND TECH INDUSTRIES TEAM UP IN FIGHT AGAINST ROBOCALLS: Health systems are receiving barrages of robocalls, often from people speaking Mandarin who demand that they give up their personal information or else face deportation. Telecom companies are making an effort to stop threatening robocalls. Dave Summitt, chief information security officer for the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center, said in an appearance before the Energy and Commerce Committee that, in a span of 90 days, the institute received 6,600 calls from people posing as Moffitt or Department of Justice phone numbers.
PFIZER AGREES TO PAY $11.4 BILLION FOR OTHER PHARMA COMPANY’S CANCER DRUGS: Drug manufacturer Pfizer has agreed to pay Array BioPharma $11.4 billion for their skin cancer treatments, which could be used to treat colon and rectal cancers. Array BioPharma’s treatments for skin cancers are being tested to treat colorectal tumors, and Pfizer wants in. Andy Schmeltz, president of Pfizer Oncology, said using the skin cancer drugs to treat colorectal cancer may be a "first and best-in-class combination that could have blockbuster revenue potential,” that will “further augment our existing leading positions in both breast cancer and prostate cancer."
NEBRASKA SCHOOL DISTRICT WILL TEST FOR NICOTINE TO FIGHT VAPING: Fairbury Public Schools in southeast Nebraska will begin testing students for nicotine as a requirement for participating in extracurricular activities like sports, speechmaking, and marching band. “It has been something that has been on our mind for a while because we have seen a drastic increase in students that are vaping,” Stephen Grizzle, the district’s superintendent, said in an interview. “Smoking in general, but vaping seems to be the craze right now.”

Democrats can turn immigration into a total loser for Donald Trump in 2020 — if they dare

Resumen: Trump obsesses about immigration so voters will blame 'the other' while he enriches his friends. This is racism in the service of plutocracy.

Texto completo: When President Donald Trump kicks off his reelection campaign Tuesday in Orlando, Florida, expect him to do what he does in every rally: Demonize immigrants, puff up his strongman persona, and bask in “build the wall” chants. He does so because he believes that immigration is a political winner. Many pundits agree with him.
As an expert in immigration policy and politics, I have a different take. If Democrats are deft and daring, they can transform immigration into his Achilles' heel.
In the world according to Trump, his 2016 campaign rode racism and xenophobia to victory. In the 2018 midterms, he doubled down, invoking caravans filled with criminals and terrorists and producing an ad so racist even Fox News wouldn’t air it. Republicans suffered the largest midterm popular-vote defeat in American history.
A wiser president would get it: His obsession with immigration fires up his core supporters but backfires badly with everyone else. Encouraged by White House whisperer Stephen Miller, Trump refuses to let up. Since the midterms, he has demanded billions for his border wall, shuttered the government for 35 days, declared a national emergency of dubious constitutionality, sent troops to the border, decapitated the Department of Homeland Security's leadership, and threatened economic warfare to get Mexico to (pretend to?) bend the knee.
Voters agree with Democrats on immigration
Nevertheless, the numbers of families arriving at the border are sky high. His border strategy is as ineffective as it is cruel.
Meanwhile, at Trump rallies, he tells his followers that he is “finishing the wall” (he’s not) and calls Democrats the party of “open borders and crime” (they’re not). Yes, in 2020 he’s going to run, and run hard, on xenophobia.
What should Democrats do?
First, Democrats should recognize that the public is with them, not Trump. A majority of voters believe that immigration is good for America, object to Trump’s race-baiting divisiveness, reject the practice of ripping toddlers from parents and putting kids in cages, oppose his border wall, and want Congress to create a line for undocumented immigrants to get into — with "Dreamers" and Temporary Protected Status holders in front.
Immigration backfire: Republicans embraced Trump's scare tactics and paid a high political price
Second, beyond calling out the failure of Trump’s cruelty-and-chaos strategy at the border, Democrats need to propose pragmatic solutions of their own. Among the elements: Hire enough adjudicators and lawyers so Central Americans seeking asylum have fair, orderly and efficient hearings — a fair chance, not a free pass. Launch a regional refugee resettlement initiative — away from the border — to rescue eligible refugees through an orderly application, acceptance and admissions program. And address the root causes of migration from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador so that over time, it is safer for families to stay home than to risk the dangerous journey to America.
Third, Democrats need to proudly advocate for a properly regulated 21st century immigration system. This would involve putting the nation’s 11 million hardworking undocumented immigrants on a path to legal status and eventual citizenship by creating a line and establishing requirements; improving and making more flexible a legal immigration system that reunites families and meets legitimate labor demands at all skill levels, within clear and adjustable annual limits; and in addition to smart and accountable border security, focusing enforcement on bad actors, from criminal smugglers to public safety threats to unscrupulous employers.
Fourth, and speaking of unscrupulous employers, Democrats should realize that Trump is not just a failure, he’s a fraud. As a politician, Trump rages against undocumented immigrants to score points. As a businessman, he hires undocumented immigrants and steals their wages to make profits.
Don't fear this fight, take it to Trump
Trump’s duplicity was first exposed last December in The New York Times when Victorina Morales, Sandra Diaz and other workers from the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, came forward to tell their stories of hard work, low pay, no benefits and unfair treatment.
The Washington Post exposed Trump’s reliance on undocumented immigrants at Trump enterprises in New York and uncovered a “pipeline” of undocumented workers from Costa Rica to build the Bedminster property.
Univision recently reported that Trump’s winery in Virginia hired undocumented workers who worked “long hours from sunrise to sunset, without overtime pay. ”
GOP women say money can help: Invest in Central American women to ease border crisis
The president’s son Eric, nominally in charge of the family business, has rushed in to cover up the Trump Organization’s misdeeds by discarding the exploited workers, mostly through the introduction of E-Verify, a voluntary program that lets employers check the legal status of employees. Meanwhile, his father has displeased the nativist right by expressing opposition to E-Verify. Evidently, the habits of an old school lawless employer die hard.
Finally, Democrats need to expose Trump’s cynical motivation for obsessing about immigration. He wants to get voters focused on blaming “the other” so he can keep them from focusing on kitchen-table issues — health care, retirement security, fair wages and more — that favor Democrats. He lines the pockets of his super wealthy friends, picks the pockets of ordinary Americans, and points the finger at brown and black immigrants. This is nothing less than the strategic use of racism in the service of plutocracy.
Democrats need not fear this fight with Trump. They need to take it to him. Because on his signature issue, Democrats support solutions that hit the mark with the majority of Americans, while Trump is an abject failure and a world-class hypocrite.

Texto completo: Toby Fleishman is a catch. He's a respected Manhattan doctor just north of 40 with two bright kids and "don't forget, still with his hair." He's recently split from his wife, Rachel, but a line of affluent, athleisure-clad women on dating apps seem to find him charming, ravenous to "set his weary heart afire with double entendre." What's not to like?
Well. Taffy Brodesser-Akner's assured and spiky novel about a busted marriage, "Fleishman Is in Trouble" (Random House, 384 pp., ***1/2) is an assault on misleading surfaces. In most domestic novels, that means revelations of an affair, a hidden trauma or a long-buried family crisis. But Brodesser-Akner is after something more common yet more subtle: the inability of two members of a couple to simply hear each other, and how that miscommunication is often gendered.
"Anyone who has ever been to just one session of couples therapy could tell you that beyond your point of view lies an abyss with a bubbling cauldron of fire, and that just beyond that abyss lies your spouse's point of view," she writes.
At first, the chasm between Toby and Rachel seems straightforward. Toby is minding the kids and his career, pursuing a much-craved promotion. Meanwhile, Rachel, a high-powered agent -- her biggest client is the creator of a "Hamilton"-esque musical about Woodrow Wilson's wife -- has gone AWOL since the split, unresponsive to days of calls and texts. That's enough time for Toby to doom Rachel as a Bad Mom, nurse slights and get drunk on dating-app profiles.
Caught in the middle is Toby's friend and the novel's narrator, Elizabeth, who has learned a few lessons about gender roles while working at a men's magazine. For her, Rachel's vanishing act is a problem for sure, but Toby's I'm-the-victim keening about how Rachel "went for his masculinity like it was an artery" blows matters out of proportion at Rachel's expense. As Elizabeth puts it: "Whatever kind of woman you are, even when you're a lot of kinds of women, you're still always just a woman, which is to say you're always a little bit less than a man."
Brodesser-Akner, who like Elizabeth toiled at men's mags before her current post at The New York Times, is a top-notch featured writer thanks to her hyper-observant sensibility, which serves her well as a novelist. Equally important, she's a master of structure, knowing what to withhold to keep a reader's interest. For most of "Fleishman Is in Trouble," she conceals details of Rachel's disappearance: What kind of woman would vaporize on her husband, kids, job, just like that?
Well. The final third of the novel cannily upends our understanding of the Fleishmans' relationship, exposing what kind of labor in a marriage is valued, what culturally qualifies as good parenting, why the bar for being considered a good dad is so low and why the one for being deemed an unfit mother is even lower. "Fleishman" is an entertaining novel about 40-something foibles, but it also delivers a piercing message about just how much within a relationship is prone to misinterpretation.

Texto completo: Fifty years ago, on June 17, 1969, robes opened and so did "Oh! Calcutta!" An erotic revue conceived by the English theater critic Kenneth Tynan, "Oh! Calcutta!" took it all off at the Eden Theater, a former pornographic cinema that had been renovated by the show's producer, Hilly Elkins.
Mr. Tynan borrowed the title from a naughty French pun (a loose translation: "Baby Got Back"), soliciting anyone and everyone to submit a titillating sketch. Nothing "about art or redeeming literary merit," he advised. A lot of the luminaries (Samuel Beckett, Tennessee Williams, Edna O'Brien) dropped out or were dropped, but the final, all-male lineup included Sam Shepard, Jules Feiffer and John Lennon, who contributed the masturbation comedy "Four in Hand."
After Harold Pinter and Peter Brook declined to direct, Mr. Tynan entrusted the show to Jacques Levy, a clinical psychologist and an associate of the experimental Open Theater. Mr. Levy recruited the Open Window, an eclectic trio, to compose the music. Margo Sappington choreographed the show's several nude dance and movement sequences.
In The New York Times, Clive Barnes wrote, "There is no more innocent show in town -- and certainly none more witless." "Oh! Calcutta!," he suggested, "is the kind of show to give pornography a dirty name." (Want to judge for yourself? A grainy YouTube video exists.)
Still, the original production ran until 1972, eventually moving to the Belasco Theater on Broadway. A 1976 revival remains Broadway's longest-running musical revue.
To mark the half-century, we spoke to several of the show's writers and composers, as well as to five original cast members (a couple of whom, Bill Macy and Alan Rachins, would later find fame on television). Here is the truth, naked and clothed, in excerpts from the conversations.
CREATING
Bring your friends
Raina Barrett (cast) I followed all the audition offers. I saw that one; it mentioned nudity. And I thought, "Well, we don't know how much nudity. I'll consider it."
Bill Macy (cast) Jacques Levy was a personal friend. And I had worked with him before. He said, "Come on, we're going to do the play." That was it.
Peter Schickele (composer) The Open Window was a chamber rock ensemble that I formed with a buddy of mine from Juilliard, Bob Dennis, and another composer, Stan Walden. Jacques asked us if we were interested in writing original music for a new show he was working on. We were.
Sherman Yellen (writer) Hilly wanted an erotic sketch. I had read some Victorian pornography, which I thought was a hoot, ripe for satire. That became "Delicious Indignities."
Jules Feiffer (writer) Ken Tynan asked me to contribute. I more or less knew what I was getting into, and couldn't resist the shoddy rock 'n' roll glamour of it all.
Margo Sappington (cast, choreographer) Michael Bennett was asked to choreograph "Oh! Calcutta!" I was his assistant and performing in "Promises, Promises." He came to my dressing room between shows. He said, "I need you to come and help me. And oh, by the way, you have to be naked." When he decided he wasn't going to do the show, the producers asked him for a recommendation. He said, "Margo can do it." I was 21.
Samantha Harper Macy (cast) I had a girlfriend; she was selling Pepsis at the concession stand at "Oh! Calcutta!" She said, "Get on a bus. Get here as fast as you can. Everybody's naked and all the guys are straight."
Auditioning
Improv in the nude
Barrett The first audition was in Hilly's office, up in the 60s. When you had an audition at a private apartment, it was a signal for a trap. So I went in full of trepidation. But Jacques and Hilly were delightful. At the end, they asked me what I was going to do about my teaching job. I said, "I'll quit."
Sappington The nude audition was an acting improv. You were given a situation: You had just received some extraordinary, fabulous news and you had gone for a walk in the woods to absorb this joyful event. You come upon a stream, and you decide to go for a swim. You take off your clothes, you get in the water, which was a sheet that was placed on the stage, and you compose a letter or a phone call to someone that you love telling them this news.
Alan Rachins (cast) There were so many different elements to think about that the fact that you were standing naked onstage really receded into the background.
Nancy Tribush Hillman (cast) I dressed in clothes I could easily take off. A safari dress and red-and-white-striped bikini underwear, no bra. It was the best audition I'd ever given. After I got the job, Jacques said, "When I saw the red-and-white underwear, I knew I had something special."
Rehearsing
'They had to wear robes'
Yellen It was less sexy than a lot of rehearsals.
Stanley Walden (composer) We had these robes ordered and whenever anybody wasn't working specifically on a scene, they had to wear the robes. There was no casual nudity.
Hillman They were a slight material, a cool kind of smooth material, a light gold.
Sappington On a daily basis, we would do these sensitivity exercises. One day Jacques said, "Throw your robes off," and everybody threw their robes off and screamed and laughed and jumped around until we fell into an exhausted heap. That was three weeks into the rehearsal process.
Barrett Jacques was very clear that we didn't have to do anything we didn't want to do. That was one of his first statements: "Just say, flat out, 'I object! I don't want to do that."'
Macy The nudity didn't bother me. I'm from Brooklyn.
Harper Macy He put it in his bio: "I was born nude."
Rachins It was very difficult. You're not just naked, you're vulnerable. I felt extremely vulnerable. Jacques suggested an N.I.L., a no-intercourse law. And as far as I know, people adhered to it.
Previews
Hypocrites and celebrities
Walden Our first night and we ran about three and a half hours. We spent the next month searching for the right combination of sketches. One number that was cut was the history of women's underwear, a big production number with costumes and a unicycle on the stage.
Barrett It would change every day.
Hillman There was a lot of talking about what we saw in the audience. I think we were as interested in the audience as they were in us, especially the ones in the front.
Sappington We had this kind of rule that if we saw anyone with a camera, we were to break the fourth wall and an usher would come and escort them out or take the camera away.
Schickele Early in the run, my wife, Susan, and Bob's and Stan's wives were hanging out in front of the theater and they saw a cop car pull up. They were worried that the show would be shut down for indecency, that we'd be carted away. It turned out that the cops had heard about the show and just wanted to see what all the fuss was about.
Yellen The thing that was remarkable about that audience was that so many hypocrites were in it. I mean, everybody hated "Oh! Calcutta!" But everybody from Hollywood and Broadway and the government would come to see us. It was obligatory.
Sappington I missed meeting Warren Beatty, but Rudolf Nureyev came to see me. Jimi Hendrix came backstage. Everybody. The mantra was, "Well, I wasn't so shocked." That was the chic thing to say.
Opening Night and After
'People were looking for a revolution'
Feiffer I went to the opening and the party, just long enough to get drunk. I felt shame for what had been done to my sketch.
Walden At Sardi's, we were waiting for the reviews, for The New York Times. It was a pan. The investors, you could see their faces sagging. Hilly Elkins jumped up on a chair and said, "Anybody who wants to get their money back, I will buy out their investment here and now."
Barrett When the reviews came out? Oh my God, gloom and doom. I want out! I want out of this! People were hysterical and overreacting.
Walden Of course, it turned out to be the longest running revue in the history of the theater. My big income from the show came many years later. I wrote the title song and a guy used it on a hip-hop record ["1 Thing" by Amerie]. It became a ringtone best seller.
Feiffer It inspired me to extend the sort of thinking that went into my sketch. The result was the play "Carnal Knowledge" that Mike Nichols had me adapt as a film.
Macy I'm 97 years old. I go out into the street every day and I accost strangers. I talk to them about "Oh! Calcutta!" I don't wait for an introduction. I just walk up.
Rachins It definitely changed me. It was painful. It was exciting. It was funny. It was fun.
Harper Macy People were looking for a revolution. And we were part of that.
Yellen The lesson of "Oh! Calcutta!" was not nudity. It was an attitude toward women as objects, detaching romance from sexuality. I would never write that sketch today. I would never think that a subject which dealt with rape, even peripherally, was a funny one.
Walden Every once in a while somebody comes up with the idea of doing a revival. In 1969, the world was turning upside down. The whole fabric of society was cracking and changing. That's 50 years in the past. You'd have to do a completely different show now.

Texto completo: President Trump’s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort will reportedly not be moved to Rikers Island after all.
Earlier this month, a New York state judge granted a request from New York City District Attorney Cy Vance Jr. to transfer the 70-year-old Manafort, who is already serving time for federal crimes, to Rikers Island while he awaits trial on a separate state case. Rikers Island is a New York prison notorious for violence.
But last week, Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey A. Rosen sent a letter to prosecutors in Manhattan letting them know that he was monitoring where Manafort would be held.
Federal prison officials then told the district attorney’s office Monday that he would not be held at Rikers while awaiting trial, but rather will be held in federal custody in Manhattan or Pennsylvania, according to the New York Times.
Manafort was caught up in special counsel Robert Mueller’s 22-month investigation, which led to him being found guilty on eight financial crimes in Virginia and accepting a plea deal in Washington, D.C. As part of the agreement, he admitted guilt to one count of conspiracy against the U.S. and one count of obstructing justice.
Photo Caption:Paul Manafort, former campaign manager for Donald Trump, exits the District Courthouse in Alexandria, Virginia, U.S., on Thursday, March 8, 2018.

Last week, he denied wrongdoing in a related case in Washington accusing him of money laundering.

Giving off good vibrations

Texto completo: Plants and animals have some crazy lifestyles, particularly when it comes to pollination.
Pollination, as you may recall, is the transfer of pollen from one plant to another. This makes it possible for flowers to produce seeds, which, in turn, will produce more plants.
Insects need food, often in the form of plant sugars from nectar and protein from pollen. Put humans in the equation, and it’s a win-win-win situation. The plant gets to make more plants, the animal gets nutrition, and we get stuff we need — like soybeans, cotton, apples, tomatoes, and Tequila.
Pollination ranges from the straightforward to the intricate and complex. In the latter category is buzz pollination (or, to be fancy, "sonication"). Bumblebees seek nectar and pollen for food for their growing colonies in the summer.
Flowers in the tomato family have tons of nutritious pollen, but they don’t give it out for free. The flower won’t release its pollen unless it "hears" a certain vibration.
Bumblebees, it turns out, give off good vibes. In fact, just the right vibes.
Grasping onto the flower by the anthers, the bumblebee buzzes with a specific frequency. At this frequency, the flower explodes with pollen, giving the bumblebee its protein and coating it with pollen.
Thus doused, the bumblebee heads right to another flower, taking the pollen from Flower One to Flower Two, and on to many others.
Scientists have determined that the frequency of buzz pollination is equivalent to a C note on a tuning fork. (Or, the "Hey" in "Hey Jude," for those Paul McCartney fans out there.) And speaking of music, recent research has revealed an amazing new page in the pollination songbook.
Some flowers produce sweeter nectar when they hear pollinators approaching.
Yep, they "hear" or detect the vibrations of pollinators.
Michelle Z. Donahue reported in the January 2019 issue of National Geographic some exciting studies undertaken by Lilach Hadany of Tel Aviv University.
"Hadany’s team looked at evening primroses," wrote Donahue, "and found that within minutes of sensing vibrations from pollinators’ wings, the plants temporarily increased the concentration of sugar in their flowers’ nectar. In effect, the flowers themselves served as ears, picking up the specific frequencies of bees’ wings while tuning out irrelevant sounds like wind."
Sweet!
The Tel Aviv researchers also looked at flower shape and the ability to sense approaching pollinators. Plants with bowl-shaped flowers may be able to detect sound better than others.
"This makes them perfect for receiving and amplifying sound waves," explained Donahue, "much like a satellite dish."
This exciting research has launched a new field of study called phytoacoustics. It all goes to show that sometimes you do need to sing for your supper.
Another amazing plant-pollinator relationship has been recently discovered. Tilo Henning of the Botanic Garden and Botanical Museum in Berlin, and Maximilian Weigend of the University of Bonn in Germany have hypothesized that a group of plants native to the Peruvian Andes can move their pollen-bearing structures according to past visits from pollinators.
Henning and Weigend studied the plant Nasa poissoniana and determined that it can remember the schedule of pollinator visits, and repeat their movements accordingly.
"These plants can gymnastically wave around their stamens — the organs they use for fertilization — to maximize the distribution of their pollen," according to Cara Giaimo in The New York Times.
"More surprisingly, (Henning and Weigend) suggest that individual plants can adjust the timing of these movements based on their previous experiences with pollinators. In other words, they remember the past and try to repeat it."
Crazy? You bet. You can read details of the research methods and conclusions in the April 2019 issue of Plant Signaling and Behavior.
A close-to-home example of unusual pollination is the skunk cabbage-carrion insect relationship.
Skunk cabbage, as the name implies, is a smelly plant that grows in wet woods. It’s one of the first plants to flower each year — often in February when the snow is still on the ground.
The flower is definitely not bouquet-worthy. It’s dark maroon, lacks petals, and is hidden by an overarching structure.
The color, as well as the stench of the flower, mimic dead, rotting things — hence attracting carrion beetles and flies.
The flower also produces its own heat, and can maintain a comfortable 60 to 70 degrees inside the floral covering. Perfect for those carcass-loving insects.
Other examples of strange pollination abound. With each new discovery, we find that the business of life is fascinating in its complexities.
What happens when one of the partners in the intricate dance of pollination disappears?
We are losing pollinators at an alarming rate, and plant extinction continues apace. Habitat loss and pesticide use are the big culprits.
Not to end on a buzz-kill, let me present some good news to counter the bad. Everyone can chip in to restore, preserve, and protect habitat for the myriad creatures around us.

Texto completo: To explain why women make 80 cents for every dollar men make, why men are vastly overrepresented in executive positions and why female-led start-ups often struggle to secure funding, Sallie Krawcheck had one answer: society.
"We receive these messages that we're flibbertigibbets when it comes to money," said Ms. Krawcheck, the chief executive of Ellevest, a digital investment and planning platform for women.
The lessons take root at an early age, Ms. Krawcheck said in a conversation with the Times business reporter Sapna Maheshwari and Stephanie Cohen, chief strategy officer at Goldman Sachs.

Men, Ms. Krawcheck said, are conditioned early on to be more aggressive investors, often receiving financial advice geared toward beating the markets and generating immense wealth on Wall Street.
On the other hand, women are usually taught as girls to budget and to be careful with money. The lessons persist as they mature, enter the work force and earn.
The expectations are so different: "It's like, 'What financial type are you? Are you a Carrie or a Miranda?"' Ms. Krawcheck said, referring to characters from "Sex and the City."
(For what it's worth: Carrie, the character at the center of the show, was a terrible financial role model, according to Ms. Krawcheck.)
The disparity in messaging is one factor contributing to the deep gender bias on Wall Street, where women are underrepresented in boardrooms and the pay for female employees lags behind that of their male counterparts.
This year, for example, Citigroup said its female employees earned 29 percent less than men in similar positions.
"We have a lot of work to do," Ms. Cohen said of both Wall Street as a whole and of her employer, Goldman Sachs. "And we know we're not going fast enough."
To create change, longstanding diversity and mentoring programs do not go far enough, Ms. Krawcheck said. Closing the gender gap will require change from the top.
But both Ms. Krawcheck and Ms. Cohen encouraged women to speak more openly about their financial goals and ambitions.
Ms. Cohen encouraged women not to be afraid to talk about money with their supervisors. Employees who talk more often about compensation when discussing performance and setting their goals are more likely to get raises, she said.
In Ms. Krawcheck's Wall Street days, those groups often split along gender fault lines.
"All the guys would come and tell me how much more money they wanted to make all the time," she said. "And all the women didn't, because they were afraid to. So it was easy to fall into 'the squeaky wheel gets the grease."'
As important as it is to change the conversation around money, it is equally important to control the money. In Silicon Valley, where female start-up founders received only about 2 percent of venture-capital money last year, Goldman Sachs is working with women to help them make appeals to rooms that are generally dominated by men, Ms. Cohen said.
"When women pitch their business, they tend to talk about what they have achieved," she said. "And men tend to talk about the vision."
Ms. Krawcheck added that male investors also tended to ask women questions about a business's risks, while male founders were asked more often about its potential. Women have to fight to avoid getting pulled into "the downside rathole."
When in doubt, Ms. Krawcheck said, women should fall back on the data. Research has shown that female start-up executives often get better returns than men.
"While men tend to have more of the home runs, they tend to go bankrupt more often," she said. "But women hit more singles and doubles."

How Perfect Do You Need To Be?

Texto completo: Conversations about the gender gap are usually focused on dollars and cents, because women still earn 80 cents for every dollar a man makes. Yet the gap is wider than that, and encompasses more than just wages.
A new report from the compensation data company PayScale found that in 2019 women remain less likely than men to hold high-level, high-paying jobs; they also move up to management at a slower pace than their male counterparts.
The report was based on surveys of nearly two million people and concluded that women in the American work force are "often undervalued for the work they do."
[Video: 'Am I Good Enough?' a discussion with Adam Grant, Alicia Menendez, Reshma Saujani and Rachel Dry at the New Rules Summit. Watch on YouTube.]
Even in technology, where the wage gap is significantly narrower than it is overall -- 3 percent, according to a recent report from Hired, a job search platform for the tech industry -- 65 percent of women say they've been discriminated against because of their gender.
Being undervalued has led to women being underrepresented in management positions, in C-suites and on corporate boards. Although the causes of this disparity are numerous and often complex, one of the most significant is gender stereotypes.
"We definitely socialize our girls to be perfect and we socialize our boys to be brave," said Reshma Saujani, founder and C.E.O. of Girls Who Code, a nonprofit that aims to increase the number of women working in computer science. Ms. Saujani, also the author of "Brave, Not Perfect," was speaking last week at the New Rules Summit in Brooklyn, a conference on women and leadership hosted by The New York Times.
"We raise our boys to be risk-takers, to be fearless. And when boys become men they ask for outsize raises, they ask for promotions they're not qualified for, they launch start-ups with abandon," she said. "Different case for us."
Many influential psychological theories of gender and power underscore the central role stereotypes play in keeping women from attaining leadership positions. Those stereotypes often make women feel they aren't smart enough, qualified enough -- perfect enough, essentially -- to climb the career ladder.
And we unwittingly perpetuate these gender stereotypes, and the resulting psychological barriers they create, in the ways we socialize our children, Ms. Saujani said. "So if women are waiting to be perfect to lead," she said, "we'll never close the leadership gap."
And that gap is not narrowing. Women in senior leadership positions are dramatically outnumbered by men, according to a 2018 report on women in the workplace from McKinsey & Company that found only about one in five C-suite leaders is a woman (only one in 25 is a woman of color).
Yet when women propel themselves toward senior leadership positions it can backfire, said Alicia Menendez, who shared the stage with Ms. Saujani. She is the author of the forthcoming book "The Likeability Trap."
Women often question whether or not they are "good enough" professionally, Ms. Menendez said, but the question could also be "do other people think I am good enough?"
When she began researching her book, Ms. Menendez imagined that professional women who didn't care whether they were well-liked were "living their best lives and marching to the beat of their own drummer."
But the reality, she said, was that they, too, "pay a price for being brazenly themselves, especially women who are ambitious and strive to lead. And that often happens in the early part of a woman's career." These women start out confident and eager, with lots of new ideas, but soon learn that others see something wrong with the way they conduct themselves.
"She is either too soft, too warm, not seen in the eyes of other people as a leader, or too strong, too assertive, too aggressive, too much," Ms. Menendez said. "The problem is not that she's doing it wrong, it's that it's nearly impossible for a woman who strives to lead to do it right."
One way forward, she posited, is to shift the focus from how women work to the quality of their work. Another may be to strive to be the kind of leader others want to follow, not necessarily "like."
Robin Ely, a professor at Harvard Business School and the faculty chairwoman of the school's Gender Initiative, said female leaders can navigate the likability trap by having a clear purpose -- one in which those around them are also invested -- and by creating conditions that allow others to rise and thrive in service of that shared purpose.
"That's not to say you won't experience the competence and likability trade-off," Ms. Ely said. "But you have a better shot at making your way through the gender stereotypes if you focus on your purpose as a leader and making sure it is a purpose in which others are also invested."

Terrence McNally's speech was a lifetime achievement too

Texto completo: "Lifetime achievement," said the writer Terrence McNally at the Tony Awards last weekend. "Not a moment too soon."
That dry opening joke by the 80-year-old author of such dramatic masterworks as "Master Class," "Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune" and the criminally underappreciated "Mothers and Sons" -- not to mention the books to the musicals "Ragtime," "Kiss of the Spider Woman" and "The Full Monty," and the libretto to the opera "Dead Man Walking" and countless other screenplays, teleplays and other works -- was about the most awkward gag of the night.
Why? Clearly the ever-impish and self-aware McNally was acknowledging his own mortality. And in America, at this moment, nothing seems to make an awards show crowd less comfortable.
It's hard to come out in your fancy clothes and roar for youth and change, to take down the old guard, when the old guard is not necessarily looking so good.
McNally had taken a while to walk onstage, leaving the award's presenter, Karen Olivo, to nervously stare at her monitor. And he came out with attached breathing apparatus, tubes dangling, as if with a certain intentionality. In play after play, McNally wrote about gay Americans confronting early deaths that could have been avoided had people outside the theater industry given more of a darn. His own appearance put that back in mind.
Broadway artists love to complain about the grip of the patriarchy. But an inconvenient truth is that the patriarchy -- if you mean straight, white, WASP-ish men -- never gave two shakes about the theater. This industry was never banking, or even Hollywood.
Broadway always was the home of outsiders. In fact, Broadway largely was the creation of outsiders, especially gay men.
They were the ones who composed most of the musicals, choreographed most of the dance numbers, wrote many of the plays. They ran things too and were most of the critics. (They still are.)
This remarkable community, often under duress, sometimes working while dying, built a stable, billion-dollar industry for the rest of America and, as the now-cliched Tonys speech about the kids watching at home goes, in the process made a lot of people in the hinterlands feel less alone.
They taught us all how to love. And, yes, how to die. For, as Tony Kushner once said to me, we only learn how to deal with grief and loss by hearing the survival stories of others.
It's fair enough to argue that much must now change for all kinds of good reasons, that opportunities must be broadened, but the lack of gratitude to these forefathers expressed by many young progressives is nothing short of breathtaking. There is a chronic misunderstanding of history. The Broadway establishment has always been composed of rebels and outcasts -- without whom, the misery of the era of AIDS would have been so very much worse. These gay men saved lives.
But back to McNally, a lifesaver himself.
Many an outre fashion statement was photographed and breathlessly described at the Tonys. But nothing shuts people up like a breathing tube. No one wants to tweet about that. Almost no one did. Especially since McNally appeared in stark contrast to an image of the writer who had shown up a few weeks earlier in a glossy New York Times Style Magazine shoot, which had made him look 20 years younger.
Now you might well have watched the Tony Awards on Sunday night (assuming you weren't part of the 14% of viewers of last year's ceremony who had dropped away) without seeing what I am describing. McNally's award, and thus his speech, did not appear in the broadcast portion of the evening, which tells you right there how much we value lifetime achievement these days.
Of course, lifetime achievement awards are complicated for artists. Upon receiving one, David Mamet once said to me: "The idea of life achievement only means one thing to the artist. 'Don't you think that's just about enough?' The healthy artist would respond, 'I'll be the judge of that. At some point, I'll leave. But you'll have to kill me.'"
Mamet was exactly right.
But I found what McNally had to say (I was watching it live) to be far and away the most powerful part of the evening. He did not quip like Mamet; clearly, McNally had decided this was the moment to define his life.
The speech was little more than three minutes. Yet this was the most beautiful recounting of one of this nation's most distinguished artistic careers.
"Theater changes hearts," he said, struggling to fully breathe his way through his words. "That secret place where we all truly live."
McNally found time to speak of early failure and how John Steinbeck told him to get back on his horse: "If you ain't been throwed, you ain't rode." He recalled how much the artists of a previous generation had meant to him as a small boy. He revealed that his father, after watching "Death of a Salesman" and seeing a traumatic vision of what happens to so many of us later in an American life in an American business, had quit his job and struck out on his own.
He talked about his pride in "softening the hearts" of unforgiving parents, which is about as noble a quest for an artist as any that one could imagine. He told young artists he was part of a writing club with open admission: "The only dues are your mind, your soul and your guts. All of you."
"The world needs artists more than ever," McNally said, "to remind us what truth and beauty and kindness really are."
And he finished with a quote from the last act of "The Tempest," Shakespeare's late, great world of personal legacy: "O brave new world that has such people in it."
I thought at first McNally was talking about the theater in the self-congratulatory way theater people often do.
But no. He had a broader purview.
"Shakespeare was talking to all of us," McNally said. "No one does it alone."
Right. Whatever you do.
What an achievement. What a life.

Texto completo: It was Nov. 13, 1947, and the New York Knicks' first-round pick took to the basketball court at Madison Square Garden. It wasn't his first time playing in the Garden - he had helped win two college basketball championships there in 1944 and 1947, turning in impressive defensive performances.
That night, though, he struggled.
Three weeks and three games later, he was cut. He never played pro basketball again.
Still, that man, Wataru "Wat" Misaka, has a place in the history books. Misaka was the first person of color to play professional basketball in what would become the NBA - breaking the color barrier the same year Jackie Robinson did in pro baseball. And Misaka did it in the aftermath of World War II, when the attack on Pearl Harbor and war with Japan prompted the U.S. government to imprison more than 100,000 people of Japanese ancestry in internment camps.
Now, 72 years later, with the Raptors' Game 6 win Thursday night, Jeremy Lin has become the first Asian American to win an NBA championship. (Lin only played for a few minutes during Game 3 of the Finals, but he will still get a ring along with the rest of his team.)
Lin now joins Misaka in the history books.
Misaka - born in Ogden, Utah, to Japanese immigrants - faced relentless racism for much of his life. He was raised in the basement of his father's barber shop, between a bar and pawnshop and surrounded by brothels, according to the University of Utah's magazine, Continuum, which profiled him in 2010. He was banned from restaurants because of his Japanese ancestry, and neighbors would cross the street to avoid him.
"That's just how it was," he told Continuum.
He excelled in school, and his dad encouraged him to play sports.
"I was also captain of the football team, a shortstop, ran track," in addition to basketball, he told The New York Times in 2005.
He spent two years at a junior college before transferring to the University of Utah, playing on both schools' basketball teams. On away games, people would shout "dirty Jap" at him from the stands. Back then, the National Invitational Tournament was a bigger deal than the NCAA final, and winners of the NIT were considered the unofficial national champions. In 1944, Misaka played for Utah in the NCAA final and the NIT; they won both.
When he got home from the tournaments, his mother was waiting at the train station with his draft notice, he told Continuum. He served in the military for two years, including a nine-month tour in Japan.
Because his family lived outside the West Coast resettlement zone, they weren't sent to internment camps like other Japanese and Japanese Americans during World War II.
After his service, he rejoined the Utah team and was a key player in their surprise win over Kentucky at the NIT in March 1947.
That fall, he was the New York Knicks's first pick. His photo ran in The New York Times right before his debut, with no comment on how he was about to make history by breaking the color barrier. Instead, they noted how short he was for a basketball player - only 5 feet 7.
His three pro games were tough, and he scored only seven points total. When he was cut, Knicks president Ned Irish told him he could keep the Converse high-tops they had just given him, the Times said.
In 1998, Misaka told The Washington Post he never experienced much racism, even at a time when Japanese Americans were targeted, "because most of the time I was with a sports team. ... In general, I had a better acceptance from the crowd in New York than anywhere. I really appreciated that."
The Harlem Globetrotters offered him a spot on their team, but he declined. He took a train home to Utah, finished his degree, and worked for decades as an engineer before retiring.
As of 2018, he was 95 and still living in Utah. He could not be reached for comment.
In 2010, Misaka's place in history was highlighted in the documentary "Transcending: The Wat Misaka Story."
The trailer shows rare footage of him playing.

Texto completo: Last Sunday morning, during parental small talk at a kids' birthday party in Brooklyn, one dad told me he had just “cobbled together" summer camps for his child, to which I replied that camps in the area are very “cobble-able." Sensing a prime opportunity, his eyebrows rose. “Cobble Hill," he said, referencing a nearby neighborhood.
Then we paused, heads shaking with a smidgen of shame. We knew what had just happened. Dad jokes had been committed.
What is it about procreating that turns men into miserable comics? In honor of Father's Day, I'd like to float a theory while also making the case for the virtue of our much-mocked brand of humor.
Dads have, of course, been telling bad jokes forever, but the term “dad joke" didn't enter the lexicon until the past decade. In the last few years, it has become a ubiquitous if affectionate insult online, and even its own booming comedy genre.
I'm a comedy critic, so being a dad can seem like an occupational hazard. It may be professional suicide to admit, but since having children, I often find myself making lame puns as well as poop jokes. In subway stations, I have been known to silently mouth words to my daughters when a loud train goes by until the noise quiets and I add: “ ... and that's the secret to life." Look, I'm not proud.
The demise of a dad's sense of humor begins in early parenthood while workshopping jokes in front of babies, tiny Philistines who think peekaboo is a hilarious bit of misdirection. It isn't long before these drooling rubes turn into trash-talking toddlers and fall in love with the scatological. Like so many lazy comics, we parents pander. If jokes work, they stay in the set. Gradually, we become hooked on cheap laughs. Some of us even delude ourselves into thinking we are actually funny.
This may sound like I'm blaming children for dad jokes, but only partly. Once dads develop this new sensibility, it doesn't evolve, while our audience does. When their humor matures, they mock ours and, in their search of a critical language to express their contempt, the dad joke was born.
Dad jokes are the training wheels for cringe comedy. Part of their purpose is to embarrass and create discomfort, a benign troll. The goal often is to get not a laugh but a groan. It's probably no accident that the oldest collection of dad jokes you can buy on Amazon is from an English writer (Ian Allen, who wrote “The Very Embarrassing Book of Dad Jokes" in 2012), since the British comic tradition has always been best tuned to the delight of embarrassment.
One appealing aspect of dad jokes is how they can be self-mocking and teasing simultaneously. An ironic distance is baked into them. No wonder they're popular among Generation X parents.
But they have deeper roots. Dad jokes tend to be clean, generic, and short, requiring no context or explanation. In many ways, they are throwbacks to the days when comics leaned on bits that started with a trio of religious figures walking into a bar, or evergreen one-liners that began with, “Did you hear the one about. . . ?"
Professional comics once trafficked in these jokes, but they went out of fashion as stand-up became more ambitious, and also more personal, putting a premium on original material that reflected a specific point of view.
What's striking about the new dad joke books is how similar they are to once-essential, long-forgotten gag books from the middle of the last century, the kind written by prolific quip collectors like Robert Orben, whose work was plundered by entire generations of comics as disparate as Joan Rivers, Steve Martin, and Dick Gregory.
Say what you will about a joke like, “What do you call someone with no body and just a nose? Nobody knows," but it doesn't age.
The history of comedy is not a linear story of steady progress, and the dad joke may just be the latest incarnation of a genre whose appeal is deep-seated and will never die so much as be reborn in different incarnations. (A cousin of this genre can be found in the quips in “Old Jews Telling Jokes," a website that was turned into a hit off-Broadway play.)
The best argument for dad jokes is that bad art can be tremendous fun. Anyone who tells you differently has never cackled their way through an abysmal movie as they made fun of it with good friends, or gleefully beat a joke into the ground, or seen Norm Macdonald spoof a roast by telling the most hackneyed jokes with complete conviction.
Bad jokes clarify the feat of good ones but also show their limitations. Stale punch lines rarely segregate those who get it from those who don't, but they unify everyone in sighing condescension. They're inclusive, the opposite of inside jokes.
In a time when bad jokes often mean jokes that offend, dad jokes carve out space to hate comedy for purely aesthetic reasons. Politics are involved, of course, because where is the mom joke? That the term doesn't exist says less about mothers' senses of humor, which are just as corny as fathers', than about restrictive gender roles that cast women as humorless disciplinarians.
And yet, with our nation so divided, and our popular culture increasingly following suit, surely one of the few things that everyone can agree on is that “What do you call a fake noodle? An impasta" is an absolute abomination.

Voters, your foreign policy views stink

Texto completo: Most of human history has been marked by war. Between 1500 and 1945, scarcely a year went by without some great power fighting another great power. Then, in 1945, that stopped. The number of battlefield deaths has plummeted to the lowest levels in history. The world has experienced the greatest reduction in poverty in history, as well as the greatest spread of democracy and freedom.
Why did this happen? Mostly it was because the United States decided to lead a community of nations to create a democratic world order. That order consisted of institutions like NATO, the U.N. and the World Bank. But it was also enforced by the pervasive presence of American power  military, economic and cultural power as well as the magnetic power of the democratic idea, which inspired dissidents worldwide.
Building any community requires exercising power. America's leaders made some terrible mistakes (Vietnam, Iraq). The nation never got to enjoy the self-righteous sense of innocence that the powerless and reclusive enjoy.
But the U.S. having been dragged into two world wars, leaders from Truman to Obama felt they had no choice but to widen America's circle of concern across the whole world. This was abnormal. As Robert Kagan writes in "The Jungle Grows Back," "Very few nations in history have ever felt any responsibility for anything but themselves."
Overall, this history should be a source of pride for all Americans, but it is not. Researchers from the Center for American Progress recently completed a survey of American foreign policy views. They write: "When asked what the phrase maintaining the liberal international order' indicated to them, all but one of the participants in our focus groups drew a blank. Voters across educational lines simply did not understand what any of these phrases ... meant or implied."
That by itself is not a problem. The liberal order was built by foreign policy elites, from George Marshall to Madeleine Albright. The problem is that voters are now actively hostile to the project. Instead of widening the circle of concern, most Americans want the U.S. to simply look after itself.
The CAP researchers asked 2,000 registered voters what U.S. foreign policy priorities should be. The top priorities were protecting against terrorist threats, protecting jobs for American workers and reducing illegal immigration. These are all negative aspirations: preventing bad things from hostile outsiders.
The lowest priorities were promoting democracy, taking on Chinese aggression, promoting trade, fighting global poverty and defending human rights. The things Americans care least about are the core activities of building a civilized global community.
After Iraq and other debacles, many Americans are exhausted by the global leadership role. Many have lost faith in the nation's leadership class. They say correctly that we have a lot of problems here at home.
But a big part of the shift is caused by the fact that many Americans have lost faith in human nature and human possibility.
Even after the horrors of World War II, most Americans said that people can be trusted. Building a community of nations seemed like a doable proposition because most people are basically good. Even today, people who express high social trust are much more likely to see America as an indispensable nation, much more likely to believe American values are universal values and much more likely to support the policies that preserve the liberal world order.
But social trust has collapsed over the decades, especially among the young. Distrustful, alienated people don't want to get involved in the strange, hostile, outside world.
There are two types of low-trust voters. On the right there are the Trumpian America Firsters, who want to cut immigration and break alliances. On the left there are the New Doves. These are young people who express high interest in human rights, but having grown up in the Iraq era, they don't want the U.S. to get involved in protecting them. A survey of American voters by the Eurasia Group Foundation reported, "People under 30 years old were the most likely to want the United States to abstain from intervening in human rights abuses."
The America Firsters and the New Doves may think of themselves as opposites, but they wind up in the same place: America should not be abroad preserving the liberal world order.
The CAP study estimates that less than a fifth of voters are traditional internationalists. The Eurasia Group study estimates that only 9.5% are.
America is withdrawing from the world; the results are there for all to see. China is cracking down on democratic rights in Hong Kong. Russia launches cyberattacks everywhere. Iran is destabilizing the Middle East. The era of great power rivalry is coming back.
We're in a dark spiral. Americans take a dark view of human nature and withdraw from the world. Wolves like Putin and Xi fill the void and make bad things happen, confirming the dark view and causing even more withdrawal.
We need a leader who can grapple with failures like Iraq, build a younger, credible leadership class and embody an optimism that pulls us out of the dark spiral.
David Brooks writes a syndicated column for the New York Times.

Report: Harriet Tubman $20 bill redesign was underway before delays

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - The work to redesign the $20 bill and affix an image of Harriet Tubman as its centerpiece was well underway before the Trump administration delayed the plans, according to a report from the New York Times.
Efforts to redesign the bill were advanced enough for officials at the Secret Service and government engravers to review a metal engraving plate and a digital image of the Tubman mock-up as recently as May 2018, the report said.
The report cited current and former sources at the Treasury Department, which oversees the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. The Times also included a preliminary image obtained from a former Treasury official, completed in late 2016, of what a new $20 bill could look like, featuring Tubman "in a dark coat with a wide collar and a white scarf, the report said.
A delay in the redesign of the $20 bill was motivated by concerns of a potential backlash from President Trump, according to the report: Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin chose a timeline extending beyond Trump's presidency to avoid the possibility of controversy, fearing that the president, who has disparaged the redesign, would cancel it altogether.
In a statement to The Washington Post on Friday, Mnuchin said the development of security and anti-counterfeiting measures first dictates the redesign process. "In the case of the $20 bill, that timetable is consistent with the previous Administration and has not been changed. As Secretary, my first responsibility is to ensure all security and anti-counterfeiting measures are properly taken in accordance with BEP's mandates. The suggestion that this process is being stalled is completely erroneous.
The director of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, Len Olijar said in a statement that "No Bureau or Department official has scrapped' anything; it is too early to develop an integrated concept or design until security features are finalized.
The White House didn't respond to requests for comment.
Last month, Mnuchin announced that Tubman would not replace President Andrew Jackson on the $20 bill in 2020, a planned change initiated by the treasury secretary in the Obama administration. Tubman, a 19th-century abolitionist leader, was destined to take the lofty position from the nation's seventh president, a slaveholder.
Mnuchin said during congressional testimony that the delay of the new $20 bill was prompted by security concerns pushing the government to first release the redesigns of the $10 and $50 bills. Mnuchin would not say whether he supported keeping Tubman on the new $20 bill, which under the revised timeline, would be left to whoever holds the treasury secretary position in 2026. That timetable would keep the Trump administration out of the final decision, even if the president wins a second term.
During the 2016 campaign, then-candidate Donald Trump described the Tubman redesign as an act of "pure political correctness.
Earlier this week, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) urged Mnuchin to reconsider the delay and to place Tubman's likeness on the $20 bill immediately. As a formerly enslaved person who led hundreds of others to freedom, Tubman had "more than earned her place among our nation's most pivotal leaders, Hogan wrote in a letter to the treasury secretary. "She deserves this honor.

Texto completo: Nueva York hizo historia ayer al convertirse en la primera ciudad del país en destinar fondos de su presupuesto a la atención del aborto.
La ciudad otorgará $250 mil dólares del presupuesto del año fiscal 2020 al Fondo de Acceso al Aborto de Nueva York (NYAAF), una organización que proporciona recursos y asistencia financiera a las personas que no pueden pagar un aborto y que viven o viajan a este estado, informó The New York Times.
Scott Stringer, contralor de NYC , destacó en un comunicado publicado el viernes en Twitter que aunque el aborto es legal en la ciudad, el acceso no siempre ha sido equitativo.
“Estoy orgulloso de que este año el presupuesto proporcionará una victoria progresiva e histórica para los neoyorquinos, y para nuestro país. Es el camino correcto para que la ciudad de Nueva York lidere a la nación “, escribió Stringer.
La medida se produce cuando varios estados trabajan para aprobar leyes que restringirían el acceso al aborto o lo harían ilegal en casi todos los casos.
También ayer, el tribunal federal de Apelaciones del Distrito de Columbia dictaminó que el gobierno de Trump no puede impedir que las inmigrantes menores de edad y las detenidas por las autoridades tengan acceso a abortos.
Abortion is legal in New York, but access hasn’t been equitable.
Today, we take a step forward by providing direct funding for abortion care in the City budget.
I’m proud to have stood with @AMillerNIRH to make this a reality.

Sanders will be remembered as disdainful Queen of Gaslighting

Texto completo: When Sarah Sanders said Thursday that she hopes to be remembered for her transparency and honesty, the first impulse was to laugh. But lying to citizens while being paid by them really isn't all that funny.
Sanders took on an impossible job when she became Trump's spokeswoman, a job that's about to reach a welcome conclusion.
She would claim to represent the truth on behalf of a president who lies. She did it disrespectfully, and apparently without shame or an understanding of what the role of White House press secretary should be.
She misled reporters or tried to, and through them, misled the American people. And all with her distinctive curled-lip disdain.
Thus, she delivered on what New York University professor Jay Rosen has called the "brand promise" of the Trump administration's treatment of the press: "Watch, we will put these people down for you."
Her quintessential moment came in the May 11, 2017, White House press briefing in which she was skeptically questioned by Michael Shear of the New York Times about her statements that she'd heard from "countless" FBI employees about how grateful they were that Trump had fired the agency's director, James B. Comey.
"Really?" asked Shear.
She replied without a shred of doubt, and as if Shear were the dumbest guy she'd ever seen.
"Between, like, email, text messages, absolutely. Yes," Sanders said. "We're not going to get into a numbers game. I mean, I have heard from a large number of individuals that work at the FBI that said that they're very happy with the president's decision."
Eventually, she was forced, under oath, to admit that this was made-up nonsense.
The report by special counsel Robert Mueller III: "Sanders told this Office that her reference to hearing from 'countless members of the FBI' was a 'slip of the tongue.' ... She also recalled that her statement in a separate press interview that rank-and-file FBI agents had lost confidence in Comey was a comment she made 'in the heat of the moment' that was not founded on anything."
Utterly unfounded, but insisted on as if it were carved on tablets, and don't you dare doubt it. That is a pretty good description of gaslighting.
And gaslighting was a Sanders specialty, day in and day out. (After a while, of course, that became week in and week out, then month in and month out, and finally, not at all, as the once-daily briefings were phased out. The last one was more than 90 days ago.)
"Sanders failed at all aspects of the job," Joe Lockhart, press secretary for President Bill Clinton, told me Thursday.
Lockhart elaborated: "She didn't keep the public informed, including canceling the briefings; she was not honest, according to her own testimony to the special counsel; and she stood by and allowed the normalization of labeling the press the 'enemy of the people.'"
In August, CNN's Jim Acosta challenged Sanders publicly on Trump's disparagement of the press.
"It would be a good thing if you were to state right here, at this briefing, that the press - the people who are gathered in this room right now, doing their jobs every day ... are not the enemy of the people," Acosta said. "I think we deserve that."
Sanders refused, deflecting to say that she had suffered media criticism, putting her in danger. At other times, she parroted the president with more destructive language: Some media people were not enemies of the people - only the "fake news" types. (In Trump World, fake news is almost always coverage that reflects poorly on the president.)
Undoubtedly, there were media people who enjoyed a friendly relationship with Sanders behind the scenes.
Some journalists defended her when she was mocked by comic Michelle Wolf at last year's White House Correspondents' Association dinner.
That's all part of access journalism, mixed with some garden-variety humanity, and it shouldn't matter a whit in any true evaluation of how she performed. The role of press secretary is, at its core, a public-facing one.
On that stage - whether in the briefing room or in an informal driveway gaggle with reporters - Sanders was set up to fail by a president who doesn't value the truth or the press.
And oh, how she rose to that challenge.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - The work to redesign the $20 bill and affix an image of Harriet Tubman as its centerpiece was well underway before the Trump administration delayed the plans, according to a new report from The New York Times.
Efforts to redesign the bill were advanced enough for officials at the Secret Service and government engravers to review a metal engraving plate and a digital image of the Tubman mock-up as recently as May 2018, the report said.
The report cited current and former sources at the Treasury Department, which oversees the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. The Times also included a preliminary image it obtained from a former Treasury official, completed in late 2016, of what a new $20 bill could look like, featuring Tubman "in a dark coat with a wide collar and a white scarf," the report said.
A delay in the redesign of the $20 bill was motivated by concerns of a potential backlash from President Donald Trump, according to the report: Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin chose a timeline extending beyond Trump's presidency - even if he won a second term - to avoid the possibility of an explosive controversy, fearing that the president who has disparaged the redesign would cancel the plans altogether.
In a statement to The Washington Post on Friday, Mnuchin said the development of security and anti-counterfeiting measures first dictates the redesign process. "In the case of the $20 bill, that timetable is consistent with the previous Administration and has not been changed. As Secretary, my first responsibility is to ensure all security and anti-counterfeiting measures are properly taken in accordance with BEP's mandates. The suggestion that this process is being stalled is completely erroneous."
The director of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, Len Olijar said in a statement that "No Bureau or Department official has 'scrapped' anything; It is too early to develop an integrated concept or design until security features are finalized."

Texto completo: If anyone doubts bias in national media, look at reporting on tariffs. Report after report is only on the negatives: higher prices for avocados, tomatoes, cars, with no mention that we have paid huge costs -- to subsidize those lower prices -- in other ways.
National media -- thanks to deregulation -- is now owned by a shocking handful of economic powers using it to control the national conversation and to put forth only their message -- or propaganda. Democracies require full information, exactly what -- until Ronald Reagan abolished it -- the Federal Communication Commission's Fairness Doctrine required, or broadcasters could lose broadcast licenses.
We deserve full reporting -- pro and cons -- including how tariffs once protected manufacturing, agriculture and jobs that meant a thriving nation and middle class. With climate change, we also deserve examination of the wisdom of importing globally -- with a ghastly carbon footprint -- that which we can produce here.

For those who haven't been in Toyota of Santa Fe's new showroom, you need to go. Thanks to general manager Buddy Espinosa ("Toyota of Santa Fe in new 'state-of-the-art facility,' " In brief, May 29, 2018), who helped design it, the mural on the showroom wall is not just beautifully painted but is also a magnificent display of Santa Fe-area landscapes and storied buildings. Thank God it isn't outside, where some vandal would think it is theirs to desecrate. So many retailers present such beauty in their stores, and so much of it is missed by our absences. Thanks to all Santa Fe artists.

'Temporary' bone spurs
Donald Trump's actions in Japan over Memorial Day and his actions on the 75th anniversary of D-Day hit close to home and are unconscionable.
My wife and I both grew up in the military. I am 79 years old and have strong memories of the Second World War, growing up in Fort Bragg, N.C. My father was an artillery instructor at Fort Bragg and went on to be on Gen. Douglas MacArthur's staff in Tokyo after the war. I had an uncle who was captured at the Battle of the Bulge and became a prisoner of war in Germany. I served in the U.S. Navy onboard a destroyer that went to Vietnam in 1960-61 (we weren't there).
My wife's father was a highly decorated fighter pilot in the Pacific, who received the Navy Cross five times (the highest Navy award next to the Medal of Honor), and was a flight operations officer on Guadalcanal. He went on to be one of President John F. Kennedy's chief of staff members. My wife is proud of her father's service and glad that he survived the war. I am proud of my father's and my service; it seemed the thing to do. "Bone spurs" -- give me a break -- that was the best he could do.

Partly to blame -- at least
The president of the United States is often felt to be the most powerful and influential person on Earth. The present occupant of that role is proving to be the hater-in-chief. Everyone who doesn't agree with him is subject to gratuitous insults. Hillary Clinton should be locked up. Joe Biden has low intelligence. Meghan Markle is nasty; even Bob Mueller, formerly a friend, is on the list. The New York Times and the Washington Post, usually considered to be factual and unbiased, now publish fake news. Half or more of the U.S. population are Democrats and are labeled evil.
It seems our world is permeated with hate these days. Mass shootings are frequent, while gays and Jews are targeted. Personally, I think it is reasonable to hold Donald Trump at least in part to blame. Some may agree with his policies, but I don't see how anyone can stomach his behavior.

Texto completo: NUEVA YORK – Un bebé de 4 meses llamado Constantin Mutu es el niño migrante de menor edad identificado hasta el momento entre las miles de víctimas de la separación de familias en la frontera Estados Unidos-México por la política de “tolerancia cero” del gobierno de Donald Trump, reveló este viernes The New York Times.
Exclusive: We found the youngest known child separated from his parents at the border under President Trump. He was only 4 months old https://t.co/IHSAe6ebrs
— The New York Times (@nytimes) June 14, 2019
Un episodio en “The Weekly”, la nueva serie de televisión producida por el NYT, aborda las vicisitudes que atravesó el pequeño rumano, enviado a los cuatro meses a un hogar de acogida lejos de sus padres, que habían viajado a México desde Rumania con dos de sus cinco hijos -él y un niño de 4 años- para pedir asilo en Estados Unidos en 2018.
Los agentes fronterizos estadounidenses detuvieron en Texas al padre, Vasile, y al bebé Constantin, y después la madre, Florentina, y el otro hijo y los padres y el hijo mayor tuvieron que volver a Rumania.
De acuerdo a la historia que adelanta el diario, el padre de Constantin tiene antecedentes criminales y aseguró haber recibido “presiones para retirar la petición de asilo”.
Vasile Mutu fue enviado a un centro de detención y finalmente lo deportaron a Rumanía, mientras que las autoridades colocaron a Constantin, que tenía solo 4 meses de edad, en una familia de acogida en el estado de Michigan, al noreste de Estados Unidos.
“Cuando el presidente Trump se rindió a la presión y firmó una orden ejecutiva que paralizaba las separaciones, un juez dio paso a una demanda que pretendía reunir a las familias y preparó el camino de vuelta a Rumanía para Constantin”, señala el rotativo, que visitó al pequeño en el hogar de acogida y a sus padres en Rumania.
El Times reveló el año pasado que las autoridades estaban separando a los menores de sus familias en la frontera, acusó a las autoridades de no cuantificar el problema, y después calculó que en octubre había más de 700 niños migrantes separados de adultos que los reclamaban como sus hijos.

Celtics, Lakers still in chase for Davis Anthony Davis' agent insists Davis will enter free agency next year.

Texto completo: CLEVELAND -- If Anthony Davis is traded by next Thursday's NBA draft, it could affect the No. 4 pick.
That's because the Los Angeles Lakers, who own that pick, and the Boston Celtics - armed with three later selections - are now the reported frontrunners in the Davis sweepstakes with New Orleans.
Odds might favor the Lakers if Davis has his say, according to a Sports Illustrated interview with his agent, Rich Paul, who didn't mince words on why Boston should think twice in negotiations.
"They can trade for him but it will be for one year," Paul said. "I mean: If the Celtics traded for Anthony Davis, we would go there and we would abide by our contractual (obligations) and we would go into free agency in 2020. I've stated that to them.
"But in the event that he decides to walk away and you give away assets? Don't blame Rich Paul."
The Lakers have made the fourth pick, Lonzo Ball and Brandon Ingram available in trade talks, reported the New York Times.
A potential trade could hinge on Los Angeles' willingness to also part with second-year forward Kyle Kuzma.
"Among the young Lakers, New Orleans covets Kuzma the most," reported the Los Angeles Times. "Kuzma's contract is less than those of Ingram and Ball. Kuzma has two years left on his contract that are worth about $5.5 million, the second of which is a team option. Ball's contract also has two years left with a club option, but it's worth $19.72 million.
"Ingram has a year left at $7.27 million and could then become a restricted free agent."
In a March interview with Sports Illustrated, Paul said Davis would be hitting free agency in 2020 no matter where he goes this summer, effectively making the 2019-20 season an audition for any team.
According to a person familiar with Davis' thinking, that remains the plan.
"Where he's going to land? I have no idea," Paul said. "And it don't matter. We're going into free agency.
"Why does it matter to me where he goes? Earth: We're going into free agency. He has a year, he has to play. But after that, I can't say it no bigger: We are going into free agency. 2020: Anthony Davis will be in free agency."
CELTICS: Kyrie Irving has dumped his longtime agent, Jeff Wechsler, and reportedly is opting out of his final year with Boston. Irving's decision to opt out is not a surprise, but departing with Wechsler in favor of Roc Nation Sports - founded by Jay-Z - adds to the speculation that Irving is headed to Brooklyn.
As for Boston, it has Terry Rozier as a restricted free agent, and three first-round picks at Nos. 14, 20 and 22.
Rozier told ESPN that he might have to go if the Celtics don't shake up their roster.
HORNETS: Point guard Kemba Walker said he'd be willing to work with the team and take less than the "supermax" $221 million contract he's eligible to receive to re-sign with Charlotte.
The Hornets can offer Walker, their all-time leading scorer, a five-year contract worth up to $221 million. Other NBA teams can only offer a four-year deal worth $140 million.
HEAT: Goran Dragic told the team he's exercising his $19.2 million option for next season.
Dragic was limited to 36 games for the Heat last year, averaging 13.7 points and 4.8 assists - the same averages for his 11-year career with Miami, Phoenix and Houston.
He had until later in the month to decide on his option, and the move means he can now be included in trades. He turned 33 last month and was a 2018 All-Star.

Trump loyalist Sanders to depart

Texto completo: Press secretary faced credibility questions and paused press briefings
Sarah Sanders, the combative White House press secretary whose tenure was marked by controversy and questions about her credibility, will be leaving at the end of the month after 23 months on the job, President Trump announced Thursday.
The president shared the news of her unexpected departure in a tweet, writing that she planned to return home to Arkansas.
"She is a very special person with extraordinary talents, who has done an incredible job!" he wrote. "I hope she decides to run for Governor of Arkansas - she would be fantastic. Sarah, thank you for a job well done!"
Sanders, 36, has been among the longest-serving senior officials in Trump's administration. During her rocky stint as the president's official spokeswoman and top adviser, Sanders endeared herself to her boss and to his supporters by her staunch defense of him and his remarks. She often amplified Trump's criticism of the news media, pushing back on reporters' questions, sometimes sarcastically.
Sanders made her devotion to the president plain in January, when she told an interviewer for the Christian TV network CBN that "God wanted Donald Trump to become president."
But her truthfulness was often called into question, including in special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's nearly two-year investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election. The special counsel's report cites two occasions when Sanders told reporters that "countless" rank-and-file members of the FBI supported Trump's firing of then-FBI Director James B. Comey in May 2017 and that they had lost confidence in him. But when asked about this description by investigators, Sanders didn't stand behind her remarks. She told Mueller's team that the first time she made the statement, it was a "slip of the tongue" and that when she repeated it later in a press interview, it "was a comment she made 'in the heat of the moment' that was not founded on anything," according to the report.
Sanders's time as press secretary is also notable for what she didn't do as much as for what she did. On her watch, the principal function of a press secretary - representing the White House in media briefings - all but ceased to exist. The White House set a record in January for the longest stretch in modern history without a news briefing, 41 days. It then set a record, 42 days, in March, followed by a third streak, reaching 94 days Thursday.
In recent months, Sanders's primary public contact with reporters was on the White House driveway, where she would hold irregular and impromptu "gaggles," usually after appearing on Fox News.
While Sanders scaled back her public role, a decision that drew heavy criticism from media and government transparency advocates, she became more influential behind the scenes as a trusted adviser to the president, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the inner workings of the White House.
She was one of a few aides who could dissuade Trump from making a questionable decision - and occasionally help him edit a tweet - and regularly attended meetings on foreign policy, trade and health care in the Situation Room or the Oval Office, though she was not particularly versed in the details of the issues.
Trump would call her in the morning to complain about his news coverage and would sometimes talk to her multiple times a day. Sanders was also a frequent presence in the Oval Office.
The terms of her departure were unclear, though Sanders told staff around 4 p.m. in her office that it was her choice, according to people with knowledge of her comments.
"I am blessed and forever grateful to @realDonaldTrump for the opportunity to serve and proud of everything he's accomplished. I love the President and my job. The most important job I'll ever have is being a mom to my kids and it's time for us to go home. Thank you Mr. President!" she tweeted Thursday afternoon.
Although Trump floated the idea of Sanders running for governor of Arkansas in both his tweet and later during an event at the White House, it is unclear how seriously she is pursuing that idea. Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson's term isn't up until 2022.
Sanders joined Trump's presidential campaign as a senior communications adviser in early 2016 after managing the unsuccessful campaign of her father, former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee (R). She served as a spokesman for Trump during the campaign; he appointed her the top deputy to Trump's first press secretary, Sean Spicer, and she replaced Spicer after he resigned in July 2017.
In contrast to Spicer, who could grow visibly agitated under press questioning, Sanders initially drew praise from White House reporters for her calm and friendly manner. But those relations began to sour when she started to skirt questions, occasionally with a chaser of condescension, on sensitive topics by offering rote answers.
The eventual decision to stop holding briefings for long periods of time also reflected Sanders's struggle to publicly defend and explain Trump's misstatements and outright falsehoods.
In a testy exchange during a briefing in early October, for example, Sanders lashed out at CNN reporter Jim Acosta after he asked her whether she had any problem defending Trump, who had mocked Christine Blasey Ford, the California woman who accused Supreme Court nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh of assaulting her when they were teenagers.
"I don't have any problem stating facts, no," Sanders replied. She paused before adding, "I know that's something you probably do have a problem with. I don't."
On Sanders's watch, the White House took the unusual step of banning two reporters, Acosta and his CNN colleague Kaitlan Collins, from events after they asked questions Trump didn't like during televised encounters with the president.
The White House took the unprecedented action of taking away Acosta's White House press pass in early November after he angered Trump during a news conference and briefly tangled with a press aide who sought to take a microphone from Acosta's hand.
A few days later, a federal judge handed the White House a rebuke, saying it had violated Acosta's due-process rights. He ordered the White House to restore Acosta's pass. Acosta was soon back at work.
Among other questionable statements, Sanders asserted in June 2017 that the "president in no way, form or fashion has ever promoted or encouraged violence." PolitiFact found multiple examples in which Trump "showed a tolerance for, and sometimes even a favorable disposition toward, physical violence" in his campaign rhetoric and statements as president.
She also said in October that Trump was elected by "the overwhelming majority" of voters in 2016. In fact, Hillary Clinton received 2.9 million more votes that Trump, whose victory was sealed by his winning margin in the electoral college.
Other times, she appeared to be caught unaware of recent developments. In May, Sanders was blindsided by Trump attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani's disclosure during a TV interview that Trump had paid $130,000 to reimburse Michael Cohen, his longtime personal attorney, for Cohen's payment to Stormy Daniels, the porn actress who said she had a sexual relationship with Trump. Sanders had previously insisted that Trump wasn't aware of Cohen's payment to Daniels, which was made to secure her silence about the alleged affair just days before the election.
After Giuliani's comment, Sanders tacitly acknowledged that Trump himself was the source of the misinformation. She explained the discrepancy at a media briefing by saying repeatedly that she gave "the best information that we have at the time."
She also said in the summer of 2017 that Trump "certainly didn't dictate" a misleading statement to the New York Times on behalf of his son, Donald Trump Jr., about the circumstances surrounding his meeting at Trump Tower with Russian operatives during the 2016 campaign. The president's personal legal team later told Mueller that Trump had, in fact, dictated the statement.
Asked by reporters in June to explain this misinformation, Sanders declined. She instead repeatedly told reporters to ask Trump's lawyers about their statements. "I'm an honest person," she said when reporters grilled her about her credibility. She added, "Frankly, I think my credibility is probably higher than the media's. And I think in large part that's because you guys spend more of your time focused on attacking the president instead of reporting the news."
Sanders herself has occasionally been the subject of news stories, such as during the annual White House Correspondents' Association dinner in April 2018. Comedian Michelle Wolf mocked her during her standup routine, joking at one point that Sanders "burns facts and then uses that ash to create a perfect smoky eye."
Sanders, who was sitting several seats away on the dais, did not visibly react at the time. She later told Fox News, "That evening says a whole lot more about her than it does about me."

Texto completo: 30,000
Presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has received a bunch of attention for her detailed policy proposals on everything from a wealth tax to military housing. But her surge in the polls also owes something to her ubiquity. Warren has held a lot of well-attended campaign events and she's taken a ton of social media-friendly photographs with voters — 30,000, by her count, as of last Sunday, the New York Times reports.

In speech, Sanders defends democratic socialism label

Texto completo: For five decades, Bernie Sanders has embraced the label of democratic socialism.
On Wednesday, he issued a robust defense of his core political beliefs, delivering a formal address on democratic socialism in what will amount to the most aggressive attempt yet to diffuse voter concerns about his electability.
Sanders — an independent senator who has not joined the Democratic Party but is running for the Democratic nomination — presented his vision of democratic socialism not as a set of extreme principles but in terms of “economic rights," invoking the accomplishments of Franklin D. Roosevelt and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. And he argued that his ideology is embodied by longstanding popular programs, including Social Security and Medicare, that opponents often label as socialist.
Saying that the United States must reject a path of hatred and divisiveness, he said the nation must “instead find the moral conviction to choose a different path, a higher path, a path of compassion, justice, and love. And that is the path that I call democratic socialism."
President Trump has repeatedly called Sanders “crazy" and extrapolated the senator's brand of socialism to all Democrats, seizing on proposals such as “Medicare for All" to portray them as far out of the mainstream and signaling clearly that this will be a major line of attack in the general election.
Sanders delivered his speech in a small theater at George Washington University, a dozen flags behind him.
New York Times
Confusion abounds over plans for July 4 in D.C.WASHINGTON — With three weeks to go, exactly what's going to happen in Washington on the Fourth of July remains a subject of intense confusion because of President Trump's plans to reshape the nation's premier celebration.
Will Independence Day festivities be centered around the Washington Monument or shift to the Lincoln Memorial, as the White House has reportedly requested? Will Trump follow through on his plans to give a speech? And, if he does, will the speech be open to anyone, including protesters, or will the White House restrict his audience to supporters at the traditionally nonpolitical event?
The White House hasn't revealed its plans. The National Park Service, which is primarily responsible for the event, has also gone silent. That leaves the city government, which helps with security, in the dark.
Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District of Columbia's delegate in Congress, said interdepartmental planning meetings for July 4 usually begin up to three months in advance. But to her knowledge, no meetings have happened.
"The city is scrambling to figure out what to do, because all they have is the outline of what [the White House] wants," Norton said. She said she approached the National Park Service for details but "They wouldn't tell us a thing. You know why? Because they don't know a thing."
Mayor Muriel Bowser declined repeated requests for comment.
Independence Day normally draws tens of thousands of people to the National Mall for a celebration capped by fireworks.
A major security overhaul was implemented following the Sept. 11 attacks, but the occasion has run smoothly for years.
The first sign that 2019's celebration may be different came in a February tweet from Trump announcing a special "Salute to America" on July 4 that would feature "an address by your favorite President, me!"
Last week, a National Park Service official was quoted in The Washington Post saying the White House was planning a Trump speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial during the event.
But since that report, the White House and the National Park Service have refused to comment. Park Service spokesman Mike Litterst released a terse statement saying only that "We continue to work with the White House on creating a Salute to America program that will bring Americans from all over the country together in celebration of our great nation."

House panel split over criticism for arms sales
WASHINGTON — The House Foreign Affairs Committee split along partisan lines Wednesday over how sharply to criticize the State Department for finalizing 22 arms sales despite congressional objections, as Democrats accused the Trump administration of creating a "phony" emergency to funnel weapons to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
"Here's the reality: there is no emergency," said panel chairman Reprentative Eliot Engel, of New York one of several Democrats furious with the administration's moves. "It's made up. And it's an abuse of the law."
R. Clarke Cooper, the assistant secretary of state for political-military affairs, told the panel that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had been responding to a "significant increase" in threats from Iran, coupled with "the clear, provocative, damaging actions taken by Iran's government" when he announced the Trump administration would use its emergency authority to advance the arms deals worth about $8 billion.
"It was a measured response which promotes regional stability and security," Cooper said.
But Democrats weren't having it — and Republicans were clearly uncomfortable with having been circumvented, though their rebukes were more measured.
"The recent use of this emergency authority, in my judgment, was unfortunate," said the panel's ranking member, Republican Representative Michael McCaulof Texas. "Consulting with Congress is always the better route."
Members of the House committee are preparing four disapproval resolutions to try to block the arms deals.

Texto completo: SALT LAKE CITY — Amid the talk that New Orleans Pelicans star Anthony Davis wants to be traded, ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski first reported on Wednesday that the Los Angeles Lakers and Boston Celtics are in talks with the Pelicans on potential deals.


Soon after, New York Times NBA reporter Marc Stein tweeted that former University of Utah star Kyle Kuzma was a player whom the Lakers don't want to give up in a deal for Davis, but one whom the Pelicans would want.


A minute later, Tania Ganguli of the Los Angeles Times tweeted that such was indeed the case.


The 27th pick of the 2017 NBA Draft, Kuzma has had an excellent first two seasons in the NBA. This season, he averaged 18.7 points, 5.5 rebounds and 2.5 assists per game.

'Ice' thaws mystery, importance of Greenland

Texto completo: Greenland is an odd, faraway place near the top of the world. Despite being the largest island on the planet, three times the size of Texas, hardly anyone lives there: fewer than 60,000 people. And precious few visit, mostly scientists trying to fathom the secrets of its forbidding environment. Temperatures of minus 89 degrees Fahrenheit have been recorded there.
When humanity thought of Greenland at all, it was because of the explorers who challenged its vast ice sheet – roughly 80% of its land mass is covered with ice, 2 miles thick in spots. Early in the Cold War, America established an air base there and later tried to purchase Greenland from Denmark.
In his new book "The Ice at the End of the World: An Epic Journey into Greenland's Buried Past and Our Perilous Future" (Random House, 448 pp., ***1/2), Jon Gertner makes a compelling case that it's time to start thinking seriously about Greenland and its growing relevance to our lives, and those of our descendants.
The scientists who have braved Greenland's environs with ever-more-sophisticated measuring tools are united in their belief that Greenland is changing faster than anyone had thought possible. As goes Greenland, so goes the planet.
Gertner, a journalist for The New York Times, does not wax polemic. That would be overkill when the facts on the ground (or on the ice) largely speak for themselves. Most of his book consists of engaging accounts of the explorers and scientists who have been drawn to Greenland's hinterlands, among them the Norwegian Fridtjof Nansen and the American Robert Peary.
These sojourners came to conquer the elements but also to understand this strangely beautiful place. Scientists have probed and taken Greenland's measure for more than a century, and the data they have accumulated has them concerned. The island is shedding massive amounts of ice and water each year – 300 billion tons, and the pace of loss is accelerating.
Most of Greenland lies within the Arctic Circle, and its fearsome weather has been getting less and less terrifying of late. In February 2018, scientists at the northern tip of the island, a mere 400 miles from the North Pole, recorded average daily temperatures 45 degrees above normal. To put that in perspective, if such a phenomena were recorded in February in New York City, the average temperature would hover around 80 degrees for 28 days straight.
As Earth warms, northerly places such as Greenland are warming faster, as climatologists have predicted for decades now. Gertner writes that its average summer temperature is now 7 to 9 degrees warmer than normal.
Such disturbing tidbits are woven into the author's compelling narrative about the intrepid human beings whose curiosity about the world lures them to forbidding places. Gertner makes clear that science is not augury and that there are many possible eventualities for our shared future, albeit most quite troublesome and some downright apocalyptic.
One of the most concerning findings, discovered by drilling deep into Greenland's core and unlocking the secrets of its frozen past, is that climate change has not always been gradual, as scientists had long believed. There have been points of no return in the past when a telltale threshold was crossed, when ice sheets collapsed quickly and temperatures spiked dramatically.
What if the worst happened? Gertner writes that the scientists who have taken the measure of Greenland and its melting ice calculate that if it all melted away – a distinct possibility – this island alone would account for a worldwide sea rise of nearly 25 feet.

Texto completo: We're glad that Gov. Larry Hogan has joined the effort to get the Trump administration to reverse its outrageous decision to delay replacing Andrew Jackson on the $20 bill with Maryland-born abolitionist and all-around historical inspiration Harriet Tubman. He's right that Tubman's "unbelievable acts of heroism, courage, and sacrifice have more than earned her rightful place among our nation's most pivotal leaders," and one would hope that his addition of a Republican voice to the advocacy from Rep. Elijah Cummings and others might make Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin come to his senses.
But we're not exactly holding our breathe. During the 2016 campaign, Donald Trump decried the idea of Tubman on the $20 as "pure political correctness." In May, when Mr. Mnuchin announced the delay until 2026 - after Mr. Trump would be out of office even with a second term - The New York Times reported that the move was designed to make sure the president didn't just cancel the Tubman bill altogether out of pique.
Even if Mr. Trump digs in his heels on keeping Tubman off the $20, Congress can force the issue. Since 2015, Mr. Cummings and Rep. John Katko, a Republican from New York, where Tumban settled after fleeing slavery in Maryland, have been pushing legislation to require the Treasury to honor the abolitionist on the $20. The bill has yet to get a committee hearing, either under the old, Republican-controlled House or the new Democratic-controlled one.
Mr. Hogan certainly can and should lend his support to that effort, and as persuasive as a simple recitation of Tubman's accomplishments is - famed Underground Railroad conductor who risked her life to liberate slaves from Maryland's Eastern Shore, Union nurse and spy in the Civil War, prominent women's suffragist - Mr. Hogan could lead Maryland in a demonstration of just how important we believe it is to honor her legacy.
Back in 2016, when Mr. Trump was asked about the Tubman $20, he praised her and didn't object to the idea that she should appear on currency. (He suggested perhaps a Tubman $2 bill ... because who doesn't have a wallet full of $2s?) What he objected to was the removal of Andrew Jackson from the face of the $20 (he would still appear on the back in the redesign approved by the Obama administration). Mr. Trump has repeatedly praised Jackson; he also put a portrait of him in the Oval Office and visited his tomb shortly after his inauguration. He appears to see the seventh president as a kindred spirit (without letting details like slaveholding and the Trail of Tears get in the way of his admiration).
As it happens, Maryland isn't setting such a great example when it comes to being willing to honor Tubman if it means removing an honor for someone else. Eight years ago, the General Assembly debated the idea of replacing one of the two Marylanders honored in the U.S. Capitol's Statuary Hall with Tubman, but defenders of John Hanson scuttled the idea.
"John who," you say? John Hanson was a Charles County planter and Revolutionary War-era leader who held a variety of political posts, culminating in a one-year term as president of the Continental Congress under the Articles of Confederation. He is, thus, sometimes referred to as America's first president, but that rather outrageously overstates the importance of the position in the scheme of our flawed pre-Constitution government and of that government in American history, other than as an object lesson in how not to run a country. He's not nearly so prominent as Maryland's other representative in Statuary Hall, Charles Carroll of Carrollton, the only Catholic signer of the Declaration of Independence and hence an important symbol of Maryland's legacy of promoting religious tolerance. All else aside, Hanson has had a century-long run in the Capitol and represents the same era as Carroll. In addition to reflecting the contributions of women and minorities to Maryland (and American) history, a Tubman statue would symbolize a different era in Maryland history.
But Hanson had some prominent defenders, notably then-Senate Finance Committee Chairman Thomas M. "Mac" Middleton and Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller. Rather than replace Hanson, they brokered a compromise in which Maryland would establish a committee to design and raise funds for a Tubman statue to be offered to the Capitol in addition to Maryland's present two.
The only trouble is, Congress isn't keen on that idea. Replacing a statue is relatively easy, but adding a third isn't. Sen. Chris Van Hollen has been introducing legislation to allow it for years, but it has gone nowhere, and consequently, the effort to commission the statue has been in a holding pattern.
Here's what Mr. Hogan should do: Revive the effort to replace Hanson with Tubman. It's not a fool's errand; Mr. Middleton is no longer in the Senate, and while a spokesman said Mr. Miller remains supportive of the 2011 compromise, he has emerged as a major champion of Tubman who has railed against delays in erecting a statue of her in the State House. If Maryland believes honoring Harriet Tubman's legacy is important enough to displace a tribute to someone else, let's prove it.

Texto completo: Pig and Prince, the large New American restaurant housed in the stunning old station house of Montclair's Lackawana Station, closed. Service ended June 8.
The restaurant, which opened seven years ago, has been a critical success. The New York Times, in a 2012 review, deemed the restaurant "Worth It" and noted that extra care that its chef Michael Carrino, a Food Network "Chopped" champion, took with his "intriguing French-accented menu."
The restaurant's space is marvelous, with a vaulted ceiling that's nearly 50 feet tall and exposed brick walls plus huge bronze chandeliers. The restaurant is at 1 Lackawanna Plaza.
On Facebook, the restaurant posted its closing, saying:
"It is with great sadness that we must announce Pig and Prince will be closing its doors after service on Saturday, June 8th.
"We have created so many lasting relationships and friendships over the years and we want to thank each and every one of you for your loyalty and support. We hope to see you here at this historic landmark one last time before we say goodbye."
Chef Carrino could not be reached for comment.

Texto completo: HUEHUETENANGO, Guatemala - When Lesly Cano Gómez was 15, she wrote out her plan to migrate to America.
"My dream is to go to the United States," she wrote, followed by three discussion sections: "How Am I Going to Pay for It," "Who's Going to Take Me" and "Who's Going to Meet Me When I Get to the United States."
There were extensive family talks about the trip, which Cano Gómez would have undertaken with her cousin, Enilda, who is four years younger than her.
"There wasn't anything here," Cano Gómez explained. "That's why I wanted to migrate."
She knew that along the way she could be murdered or trafficked to a brothel, or else die of thirst in the desert. "But I felt I needed to go," she added. "The people I went to school with had migrated, a ton of them."
Yet today, four years later, Cano Gómez is still here in her village of Chichalum in the rugged Huehuetenango district. She now has a reason to stay - and therein lies a message for President Donald Trump.
I'm on my annual win-a-trip journey with my student winner, Mia Armstrong of Arizona State University. We've been bouncing over rough roads in the western highlands of Guatemala. It's a tough neighborhood, slammed by climate change and crop failures, and we were stopped once by soldiers in armored vehicles trying to figure out what we were trying to smuggle: drugs, people or money.
To stop the flow of migrants, Trump has called for a wall at the Mexico border that would cost billions of dollars, has separated children from parents for months, has cut off aid to Central America and, most recently, has threatened to impose tariffs on Mexico.
The result? The torrent keeps getting bigger, with twice as many migrants seized at the border in each of the last few months as a year earlier. Trump's strategy so far seems counterproductive.
People here say that this is partly because Trump is providing free advertising for the coyotes who take people north. When he thunders about migrants, he isn't scaring people away, but rather is sparking more discussion about migration.
Then there's Trump's cutoff of financial assistance in March. This reversed an Obama administration effort that enjoyed some success in using aid to improve conditions in Central America and reduce migration. El Salvador is the best example: Aid helped improve governance and reduce gang violence, and the number of its migrants to the U.S. fell by 56% over the last two full years.
In contrast, Guatemala is becoming more corrupt and messy, yet the Trump White House is ignoring the deteriorating conditions. Pushing for credible elections and effective, clean governance would do more to reduce emigration than a wall, and would be far cheaper, but Trump doesn't think like that.
That is a broader problem with Trump. He inclines toward the dramatic, visual and simplistic - a modern version of Persian King Xerxes lashing the sea for damaging his bridge - rather than grasp the difficult, complicated and imperfect policy tools that don't quite "solve" problems but do mitigate them.
Yet even in a troubled country like this, aid can help by giving ordinary Guatemalans some sense that they might have a future where they are.
Do you want to know why Lesly Cano Gómez tossed out her written plans to migrate to the U.S.? Because of an aid project.
Mercy Corps has a program to support young farmers, and Cano Gómez joined it at 16. She and others learned to adapt to climate change and produce high-quality tomatoes and other produce for export, at up to twice the local price.
"I don't need to emigrate now because there's a place for me here now," Cano Gómez told me. "This program opened doors for me. It gave me opportunity."
"It may not look like much," she acknowledged. "But we have a bit more hope, and something to aim for in the future."
Let's just acknowledge that aid is no silver bullet. In truth, while poverty is a reason people travel to the U.S., it's also a reason people don't migrate: They can't afford to. So there's even some risk that enriching people will allow more to migrate. But on balance, the evidence suggests that aid reduces emigration.
"The U.S. government has long supported effective programs to address the root causes of migration," noted Carrie Hessler-Radelet, president of Project Concern International, whose programs Mia and I visited in Guatemala. "These programs reduce the incentives to migrate and create the conditions for families to stay."
That's about right. There are no easy solutions to migration - not a wall, not tariffs, not diatribes, not family separation and not aid. But let's remember that migrants are simply fellow humans like Cano Gómez scrambling to do the best they can for themselves or their children, and that the most effective approach seems to be not a higher wall or meaner policies, but smart aid offered with a dose of humanity.

No secret immigration deal exists with US, Mexico's foreign minister says

Texto completo: The Mexican foreign minister said Monday that no secret immigration deal existed between his country and the United States, directly contradicting President Trump's claim on Twitter that a “fully signed and documented" agreement would be revealed soon.
Marcelo Ebrard, Mexico's top diplomat, said at a news conference in Mexico City that there was an understanding that both sides would evaluate the flow of migrants in the coming months. And if the number of migrants crossing the US border was not significantly reduced, he said, both sides had agreed to renew discussions about more aggressive changes to regional asylum rules that could make a bigger impact.
Trump has insisted for several days that the agreement reached with Mexico on Friday evening is a strong one, rejecting criticism that it largely called upon the Mexicans to take actions to reduce the flow of immigration that they had already agreed to months earlier.
In a Twitter post Monday morning, he said, “We have fully signed and documented another very important part of the Immigration and Security deal with Mexico, one that the U.S. has been asking about getting for many years. It will be revealed in the not too distant future and will need a vote by Mexico's Legislative body!"
New York Times
Homeland Security watchdog retires early
John Kelly, the acting inspector general for the Department of Homeland Security, announced his retirement Monday following revelations that he directed his staff to whitewash audits of the agency's performance after federal disasters.
Kelly, 64, a career auditor who rose to the top job in 2017, announced his retirement in a brief e-mail Monday morning to hundreds of Homeland Security employees and contractors.
Kelly, who had planned to retire in May, wrote in an e-mail to The Washington Post that he "accelerated my retirement because I feel it's in the best interest of the organization and its employees."
Kelly's announcement follows the Post's report last week that an internal review found that Kelly overrode auditors who had found problems with the response of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to various disasters.
When teams of auditors flew to local communities to assess how well FEMA was helping residents recover, Kelly — then in charge of the emergency management auditing staff — directed them to ignore most problems, according to the internal review and interviews. Instead, he told them to produce what the staff dubbed "feel good reports."
The practice was repeated over five years after hurricanes, floods, wildfires, and other disasters, including Hurricane Sandy in 2012 and catastrophic flooding in Louisiana in 2016, the review found.

Hard-liner is named to federal immigration post
An outspoken supporter of President Trump's hard-line immigration policies has been named acting director of the agency that manages legal immigration, despite deep opposition from key Senate Republicans.
Ken Cuccinelli will oversee Citizenship and Immigration Services starting Monday, Department of Homeland Security Acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan said.
But it's unclear if Trump will nominate Cuccinelli for the permanent position. That would require Senate confirmation, which could be difficult.
Cuccinelli is a former Virginia attorney general who ran for governor of Virginia, but lost to Democrat Terry McAuliffe in 2013. It's not just Cuccinelli's views on immigration that would generate unease among senators. As the former head of the Senate Conservatives Fund, Cuccinelli has been highly critical of Senate GOP leadership, including once advocating for the removal of Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell and his entire leadership team. The group backed conservative candidates for Senate and primary challengers for incumbent Republicans, putting it at odds with the party's chosen candidates.

A sapling from the French president to Trump has died
The Saga of the Tree has a sad ending, it turns out: A sapling given to President Trump by French President Emmanuel Macron to great fanfare has died, according to French news reports — and the symbolism wasn't lost on people who noted the strained relationship between the world leaders.
The roots of the story go back to April 2018, when the Macron-Trump friendship was being described as a "bromance," and the French president and his wife, Brigitte, were feted at the only state dinner the Trumps have hosted. The Macrons presented the Trumps with a tree meant to embody the close ties between their respective countries, and the foursome planted it on the White House lawn with gold-toned shovels in a photo op designed to highlight Franco-American unity.
Things seemed amiss shortly afterward when reporters noticed that it had been removed from its spot. But then-French Ambassador Gerard Araud assured people there was no message behind the uprooting. He tweeted that the young oak had simply been put in a standard-issue quarantine.
It seems that the sapling didn't survive its exile. Le Monde reported the demise, confirmed to the Agence France-Presse by a "diplomatic source." (The French embassy didn't immediately respond to our query.)
The White House did not immediately return a request for comment.
The tree came from Belleau Woods, the site where nearly 2,000 Marines died in World War I. Its passing comes as ties between Trump and Macron appear to be fraying over differences over Iran, trade, and the role of the European Union.

Daughter of 'tiger mom' hired as Kavanaugh clerk
Justice Brett Kavanaugh has hired the daughter of Yale Law School professor and "tiger mom" Amy Chua, who praised Kavanaugh as a mentor to women after his Supreme Court nomination.
The court is confirming that Yale Law graduate Sophia Chua-Rubenfeld will work as a clerk for Kavanaugh for a year, beginning this summer.
Shortly after Kavanaugh's nomination, Chua penned a Wall Street Journal essay extolling Kavanaugh "as a mentor for young lawyers, particularly women." Chua is known for her memoir "Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother," which describes her tough Chinese-style parenting.
Chua's essay was published before Kavanaugh was publicly accused of sexual assault, which he denied. Critics accused Chua of pandering for a clerkship for her daughter. Chua-Rubenfeld responded last year by saying she wouldn't be applying "anytime soon."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump and his acting Homeland Security secretary on Sunday defended their new agreement with the Mexican government to curb migration at the southern border, striking back at Democratic critics - including accusations that at least some parts of the deal predated Trump's recent tariff threats.
In a series of tweets, Trump said Mexico "was not being cooperative on the Border" before the deal reached Friday. Now, he said, "I have full confidence, especially after speaking to their President yesterday, that they will be very cooperative and want to get the job properly done."
He also said he could move to reimpose tariffs if Mexico doesn't follow through on its promises. Some aspects of the deal, he added, remain to be announced - "one in particular," he said, "will be announced at the appropriate time."
Meanwhile, Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan credited Trump's tariff threats - which would have placed a 5% levy on Mexican goods starting Monday, ratcheting up over several months to as much as 25% - with producing a breakthrough.
"The president put a charge in this whole dialogue with Mexico with the tariff threat, brought them to the table," McAleenan said in a "Fox News Sunday" interview, noting that Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard "arrived within hours" to begin talks.
Mexico announced it would implement "strong measures" to slow the flow of migrants across its territory toward the southern U.S. border, including the deployment of thousands of Mexican national guard troops. It also agreed to expand a program allowing Central American migrants to wait in Mexico while they await the adjudication of their asylum claims.
On Sunday, two Democratic presidential candidates said Trump had exaggerated what his tariff threats against Mexico had accomplished. They echoed a New York Times report alleging that the Mexican government had already agreed to several terms of the deal before Trump publicly floated the prospect of tariffs.
"These are agreements that Mexico had already made, in some cases months ago," former congressman Beto O'Rourke said in an interview on ABC's "This Week." "They might have accelerated the timetable, but by and large the president achieved nothing except to jeopardize the most important trading relationship that the United States of America has."
During an interview on CNN's "State of the Union," Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., also said Trump had repackaged earlier agreements with Mexico to declare success in the trade standoff.
"I think what the world is tired of, and what I am tired of, is a president who consistently goes to war, verbal war, with our allies," Sanders said, adding that Trump should focus on achieving comprehensive immigration reform.
Trump, in his tweets, lashed out at The New York Times for suggesting the deal was not entirely new and also pointed out that tariffs could be back on the table if the Mexican government does not honor its end of the deal.
"There is now going to be great cooperation between Mexico & the USA, something that didn't exist for decades," he said. "However, if for some unknown reason ... there is not, we can always go back to our previous, very profitable, position of Tariffs."
McAleenan echoed that sentiment, saying the dangling threat of tariffs amounted to "a mechanism to make sure that they do what they promise to do, that there's an actual result that we see a vast reduction in those (migrant) numbers."
Republican lawmakers appeared relieved in talk-show appearances Sunday.
Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, had voiced anxiety about the tariffs before the deal was reached. On Sunday, he had nothing but praise for Trump.
"Republicans understand that tariffs are attacks on American consumers, and we don't want to see them in place long-term, nor do I believe President Trump does, either," he said on "Fox News Sunday." "He's using tariffs as leverage in trade negotiations, and I think he used them as leverage in this situation brilliantly."
Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., speaking on Fox News Channel's "Sunday Morning Futures," defended Trump.
"Republicans need to provide the president with a lot of leeway," Tillis said, adding that if lawmakers give Trump some "unorthodox" options for negotiating trade agreements, "then America wins."
Top congressional Democrats on Saturday delivered dual attacks on the deal, saying that the agreement amounted to less than meets the eye while also arguing that the tariff threat that prompted it was reckless.
Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said the deal was "likely to be one of the president's typical, bogus solutions" to justify retreat from the tariffs, which had prompted a fierce backlash from business interests and many Republicans.

Texto completo: Chinese authorities summoned some of the world's largest chip makers, software companies, electronics firms and others last week to tell them they could face repercussions if they respond too aggressively to U.S. trade restrictions, according to people familiar with the matter.
Called by China's National Development and Reform Commission on Tuesday and Wednesday, the meetings with more than a dozen companies added a new dimension to Beijing's pushback against the Trump administration's restrictions on access to advanced American technology amid a lengthy trade dispute.
Among the companies called in were chip makers Intel Corp., Qualcomm Inc., ARM Holdings PLC and SK Hynix Inc., software giant Microsoft Corp., South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co., computer maker Dell Technologies Inc., Finnish electronics company Nokia Corp. and networking equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc., according to one of the people.
Intel and ARM declined to comment. The other companies didn't respond to requests for comment.
The warnings, previously reported by the New York Times, followed several rounds of new tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on billions of dollars of goods flowing from China to the U.S. As trade talks faltered last month, the administration upped the ante by putting Huawei Technologies Co. on a trade blacklist, further chilling already cold ties between the world's two biggest superpowers.
The move against Huawei disallowed sales to the telecom giant without a Commerce Department license. China responded by announcing an "unreliable entity list" for foreign companies that stopped supplies to China or took other actions seen as damaging the interests of Chinese companies.
On Saturday, Chinese official news agency Xinhua reported the NDRC, China's central economic-planning body, was studying the establishment of another list system to "more effectively forestall and defuse national security risks." Xinhua also said in a commentary that this new system would prevent "certain countries from using Chinese technologies and simultaneously curbing China's development."
In the meetings this week, Chinese officials told foreign tech companies that there would be unspecified consequences if they pulled out of China, ended business partnerships there or stopped supplying products to Chinese customers, especially if those moves were in line with mandates by countries China saw as breakers of international rules, one person familiar with the matter said.
Another person familiar with the meetings said the Chinese understood that multinational companies had to comply with U.S. law, but that their message was that the firms shouldn't pare back their exposure to China any more than they were required to.
The person described the meetings between midlevel China-based company executives and midlevel NDRC bureaucrats as cordial but unusual. In addition to delivering the warning, Chinese officials asked what the companies' barriers were to doing business and how the Chinese government could help, the person said.
Companies with U.S. operations must comply with the administration's restrictions on their dealings with China. They can, however, seek licenses from the Commerce Department that allow them to continue trading with Huawei or any other entity that faces similar restrictions in the future.
China's targeting of American technology has been central to the Trump administration's trade concerns. The same day Huawei was blacklisted last month, Mr. Trump issued an executive order banning foreign technology dealings when they raised national-security concerns, citing "malicious cyber-enabled actions, including economic and industrial espionage."
Negotiations with China appeared to be progressing toward a trade deal before last month, when the administration accused China of reneging on commitments by seeking significant changes to an agreed-upon deal. That set off another round of punishments and reprisals by both sides.

Google Made $4.7 Billion Off News Media's Content

Texto completo: $ 4,700,000,000.
It's more than the combined ticket sales of the last two "Avengers" movies. It's more than what virtually any professional sports team is worth. And it's the amount that Google made from the work of news publishers in 2018 via search and Google News, according to a study to be released on Monday by the News Media Alliance.
The journalists who create that content deserve a cut of that $ 4.7 billion, said David Chavern, the president and chief executive of the alliance, which represents more than 2,000 newspapers across the country, including The New York Times.
"They make money off this arrangement," Mr. Chavern said, "and there needs to be a better outcome for news publishers."
That $ 4.7 billion is nearly as much as the $ 5.1 billion brought in by the United States news industry as a whole from digital advertising last year -- and the News Media Alliance cautioned that its estimate for Google's income was conservative. For one thing, it does not count the value of the personal data the company collects on consumers every time they click on an article like this one.
"The study blatantly illustrates what we all know so clearly and so painfully," said Terrance C.Z. Egger, the chief executive of Philadelphia Inquirer PBC, which publishes The Philadelphia Inquirer, The Philadelphia Daily News and philly.com. "The current dynamics in the relationships between the platforms and our industry are devastating."
The News Media Alliance is making the study public in advance of a House subcommittee hearing on Tuesday on the interrelationship of big tech companies and the media.
Mr. Chavern said he hoped that an outcome of any conversation generated by the study would be the passage of the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act. The bill now before lawmakers would give news publishers a four-year antitrust exemption, allowing them to collectively bargain with the owners of online platforms over revenue splitting.
The bill has bipartisan support in the Senate and the House, including the chairman and ranking member of the House Judiciary's antitrust subcommittee.

"News is an important form of content that sustains civic society," Mr. Chavern added. "I think everybody, from readers to writers to politicians, understands that if journalism goes away, that's a horrible outcome for whether we're able to sustain the republic."
Google, which did not reply to a request for comment, keeps much of its data about search and revenues in a black box alongside its algorithm.
The News Media Alliance based its new report partly on a study done by the economics consulting firm Keystone Strategy. Keystone Strategy relies on a statistic that was made public in 2008, when a Google executive estimated that Google News brought in $ 100 million. The study also noted how much company revenues have grown since then, among other factors.
News is a significant part of Google's business, according to the study. Some 40 percent of the clicks on the platform's trending queries are for news. That's content that Google does not pay for, the report said, although it often presents headlines from news outlets verbatim.
Mr. Egger, of the Philadelphia Media Network, said the big tech companies should show some appreciation for the content that news publishers provide.
"There's the potential for a beautiful codependence," he said. "If you look at the reason they have such high engagement on their platforms, increasingly news is the No. 1 driver. Given that, they wouldn't want to see news go away. And yet the unintended consequence is we need to share the revenue or get paid for the content that we produce."
Two giant companies -- Alphabet, which is Google's parent, and Facebook -- are major distributors for news publishers. The two of them ferry more than 80 percent of external traffic to various sites. That is a far cry from the analog days, when media barons controlled how their publications reached the public and collected all the ad income they generated.
But Google and Facebook don't steer news consumers to news sites out of altruism. Rather, their middleman role allows them to take a huge proportion of online ad revenue. As a result, legacy news outlets have lost a crucial source of income over the last couple of decades, which has led them in most cases to shrink or disappear.
The big tech companies "like this business," Mr. Chavern said. "It's a good business, where you write for them."

SAT board ill-suited to solve social problems

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The earnest improvers at the College Board, which administers the Scholastic Aptitude Test, should ponder Abraham Maslow’s law of the instrument. In 1966, Maslow, a psychologist, said essentially this: If the only tool you have is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail. The College Board wants to solve a complex social problem that it and its test are unsuited to solve.
The College Board has embraced a dubious idea that might have the beneficial effect of prompting college admissions officers to think of better ideas for broadening their pool of applicants. The idea is to add to the scores of some test-takers an “environmental context” bonus.
Strangely, board president David Coleman told the Wall Street Journal’s Daniel Henninger that this is not, as the media has named it, an “adversity index.” But it is: It purports to measure 15 factors (e.g., poverty or food-stamp eligibility, crime rates, disorderly schools, broken families, families with education deficits, etc.) where these test-takers are situated. Coleman more convincingly says to The New York Times: “This is about finding young people who do a great deal with what they’ve been given.”
Perhaps the board’s evident discomfort with the label “adversity score” is because their more benign-sounding “environmental context” gives a social-science patina to the obverse of a category (and political accusation) currently in vogue, that of “privilege.” By whatever name, however, the SAT’s new metric is another step down the path of identity politics, assigning applicants to groups and categories, and another step away from evaluating individuals individually. But if the adversity metric becomes a substitute for schools emphasizing race, this will be an improvement on explicit racial categories that become implicit quotas.
The SAT was created partly to solve the problem of inequitable standards in college admissions. They too often rewarded nonacademic attributes (e.g., “legacies” -- the children of alumni). And they facilitated the intergenerational transmission of inherited privileges. Most importantly, they were used to disfavor certain groups, particularly Jews.
By making an objective -- meaning standardized -- test one component of schools’ assessments of applicants, it advanced the American ideal of a meritocracy open to all talents. However, it has always been the schools’ prerogative to decide the importance of the SAT component relative to others. And as “diversity” (understood in various ways) becomes an increasing preoccupation of schools, the SAT becomes decreasingly important.
Any adversity index derived from this or that social “context,” however refined, will be an extremely crude instrument for measuring -- guessing, actually -- the academic prospects of individuals in those contexts. It might, however, be a good gauge of character. Physicists speak of the “escape velocity” of particles circling in an orbit. Perhaps the adversity index can indicate individuals who, by their resilience, have achieved velocity out of challenging social environments.
But the SAT is a flimsy tool for shaping the world of social inertia. Articulate, confident parents from the professions will transmit cultural advantages to their children, advantages that, as the SAT will record them, are apt to dwarf “adversity” bonuses. As Andrew Ferguson, author of the grimly hilarious “Crazy U: One Dad’s Crash Course in Getting His Kid into College,” says, America’s least diverse classes are SAT prep classes.
The Chicago Tribune warns, plausibly, that the “secret-sauce” of the SAT’s adversity score -- schools will know it, applicants will not -- will “breed more public mistrust” of colleges’ admissions processes. But calling, as the Tribune does, for more “transparency” implies that the more admissions’ criteria are made public, the better.
However, private deliberations and criteria about applicants protect the applicants’ privacy interests. Furthermore, asserting a public interest in maximum transparency encourages government supervision of -- and the inevitable shrinking of -- schools’ discretion in shaping their student bodies, and ensuring that some cohorts are not largely excluded.
Unquestionably, such discretion often is employed in unsavory ways to serve academia’s fluctuating “diversity” obsessions, some of which contravene common understandings of equity and perhaps civil rights laws and norms.
Soon a Boston court will render a decision, probably destined for Supreme Court review, in the case concerning Harvard’s “holistic” metrics, beyond “objective” ones (secondary school transcripts, standardized tests), for -- it is alleged -- the purpose of restricting the admission of Asian Americans.
They, like the Jews whose academic proficiency was a “problem” eight decades ago, often come from family cultures that stress academic attainments.
Caution, however, is in order. Further breaking higher education to the saddle of the state is an imprudent (and, which is much the same thing, unconservative) objective.

Iowa Asians, Latinos gaining political clout

Texto completo: The ambiance inside the Machinist Hall on Des Moines' East Side felt different from the atmosphere typically preceding a presidential candidate stump speech. For one thing, it was a union hall in a right-to-work state rather than the storied VFW post and church basement usually depicted in media. The crowd of about 100 that turned out to hear Washington Gov. Jay Inslee on Monday was laid back and waiting to be impressed rather than amped up and ready to cheer. And it was uncommonly brown, youthful and female for a white, upper-age male candidate. Also, there was food and no admission fee.
It was almost as if the evening had been cooked up to refute a front-page New York Times story the day before, on Iowa's diminishing clout in the presidential nomination process. In contrasting Iowa to liberal San Francisco, the story referenced our lack of diversity, and hinted at our "establishment" mentality.
But at this forum, the relatively new Iowa Asian & Latino Coalition PAC was hosting its 13th presidential candidate this cycle. Its gatherings are full of minorities, union members and foods with an ethnic flair. And the questions posed by its constituents are some of the more vibrant and progressive you're likely to hear. They included the gutting of public sector bargaining rights, the easy access to guns and the impact of human trafficking on girls of color.
Defying conventional wisdom Yes, this defies conventional wisdom. Iowa's Latinos and Asians, who combined number under 300,000, are less than 10% of the state's population. And we don't even know how many are citizens yet, so their power as a voting bloc is limited. There has been only one Asian-American ever to serve in the Iowa Legislature and no Latinos. "Presidential staffs are not used to Asians and Latinos being active in these states," coalition chair Prakash Kopparapu said.
Yet some presidential campaigns this year are actively seeking out this group. Sen. Kamala Harris asked, and addressed it last October, before even announcing. Harris has Indian roots. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio does not, but he also met with the coalition in February, and his staff requested another meeting for the day after de Blasio announced his candidacy. Coalition leaders said they couldn't arrange it that fast. But they also vigorously pursue candidates to speak to them.
"We're kind of pushy," coalition Communications Director Mitch Henry said. "Sometimes local parties are not too happy with us."
Coalition forms to address lack of state party diversity And sometimes the feeling is mutual. The coalition was founded in December 2015 by Henry, who has Latino roots, and Som Baccam, an Asian community leader, to address the lack of political representation by those communities. It became a PAC the following year. It has caught on with grassroots Democratic activists in part because of what Henry calls a lack of diversity in the Iowa Democratic Party and its local affiliates.
Henry and Baccam are themselves examples of that lack of party outreach, according to Kopparapu, who noted their long-time political and union work, but said they've never been contacted by Iowa Democratic Party leadership. That's even though the Register last year named Henry one of the state's 50 most sought-after Democrats by candidates' campaigns.
There are civic and nonprofit organizations serving each of these communities. But unlike the Iowa Asian Alliance or the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), this coalition's mission is political empowerment. The PAC endorses and supports candidates who support that mission, regardless of their ethnicity. It is unabashedly pro-choice, pro-same-sex marriage and pro-labor. "We are brown, black, white, gay, straight, male, female, union member," Henry said.
To avoid making a faulty appearance-based assumption, I asked member Jeannie McCrea, who was there Monday evening, if she were Asian and/or Latino. "No," she replied. "Italian, Irish and French Canadian." She's a member of the Communications Workers of America, many of whom are also coalition members. Earlier, union members were about half the coalition's membership, said Henry, who has a history of organized labor involvement.
From a local to national political presence What began with 15 members today counts 500, two-thirds of whom are white. They include elected officials, aspiring candidates, professionals, students and union members. In attendance Monday were the Polk County sheriff, the Polk County auditor, a state senator, two state representatives, a former lieutenant governor and a Des Moines school board member. Since its formation, it has endorsed winning candidates, some of whom are members, for school board, city council and state legislative races.
Last year, the PAC raised and spent $24,000. It's brought in $20,000 so far this year, with a 2019 goal of $50,000. Besides a few big private donations, the money comes from a $25 annual membership fee and the sale of glasses, T-shirts and other branded merchandise. The money pays for such forums, where everyone is welcomed and fed, and supports candidates. The PAC will endorse a presidential candidate Aug. 12 and "we'll support that candidate like you won't believe," Kopparapu said.
Several of this year's presidential candidates are Asian or Latino, but that's not a prerequisite, leaders say. They're looking for someone forward-thinking and inclusive, with concrete solutions he or she is likely to implement, who is capable of unifying people and getting elected. Members pick the top four candidates and the board chooses one.
New immigrants' political attitudes have changed The younger members, whom the coalition has been recruiting actively, ask tough questions and aren't easily impressed by pat answers, Kopparapu says. "They're not clapping just because someone says 'comprehensive immigration reform.' They're asking, what does it mean?" He says they're also tired of negativity and want "positive energy."
As an Indian American, I've seen a dramatic shift in the attitudes of today's first-generation Americans from those of their parents. When I moved to Iowa in the early 1990s, the Asian-Americans I encountered leaned mostly Republican. Even Latinos who voted Democratic and supported immigration reforms and unions tended toward social conservatism, mostly for religious reasons. The Southeast Asians who had come to Iowa as refugees after the Vietnam War felt deep allegiance to the late Republican Gov. Bob Ray, who opened Iowa's doors to them. And some professional immigrants were more interested in keeping their taxes down than in workers' rights.
Kopparapu, who immigrated to the U.S. in 1996, settling in Iowa in 2004, says first-generation Americans find it useful to be aligned with people already in power. Even now, he says the Indian-Americans here prefer not to express their political views publicly. "It's the safe thing." So he has tapped the next generation, by inviting people who responded to his Facebook posts to forums, and allowing them to question candidates. Now they're "not just talking but listening," he says, and finding candidates receptive to their ideas. "Now they all want to participate."
Kopparapu, who came from a political family in India, ran for student government in graduate school in Tennessee, where Indian student candidates had bottles thrown at them and were told to go back to where they came from. He said he fell in love with Iowa on moving here, where "you could actually listen to more than Rush Limbaugh." He was thrilled to see presidential candidates up close.
Seeing underrepresented communities come of age and become politically empowered makes an already exciting time to be an Iowan even more so. And wouldn't it be ironic if the immigrant and refugee populations President Trump has delighted in denigrating, closing the door on and removing, now helped orchestrate his removal from office?

Texto completo: "The Queen" by Josh Levin Little, Brown, 432 pages, $29, out now: While on the presidential campaign trail in 1976, Ronald Reagan sought to illustrate welfare fraud by referencing a Chicago woman who "held the record" in collecting ill-gotten government checks. The actual woman behind the stereotype, Linda Taylor, was first called "welfare queen" by the Chicago Tribune, but her story is far more complex, ignored by the press and politicians who borrowed aspects of her image to vilify poor people of color. In re-examining the myth, Slate's Josh Levin explores racism in America and oversimplified narratives that still dominate political discourse.
"On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous" by Ocean Vuong Penguin, 256 pages, $26, out now: It's a big summer for debut novels, and this one by poet Ocean Vuong may be the most widely hyped of them all. "On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous" is a letter from a man in his late 20s addressed to a mother who can't read it. Examining race, class, loss, masculinity and the power of story, Vuong's work is already being hailed as "brilliant," "shattering" and "an epistolary masterpiece."
"In West Mills" by De'Shawn Charles Winslow Bloomsbury, 272 pages, $26, out now: Set in a rural black neighborhood in North Carolina, De'Shawn Charles Winslow's first novel follows a headstrong woman, Azalea "Knot" Centre, determined to live life on her own terms. Over nearly five decades, she and other residents of her tightly knit community grapple with interpersonal drama and long-buried secrets. Early reviews applaud the book's "warmth," and Rebecca Makkai, author of "The Great Believers," calls Winslow's voice "arresting and important and new."
"Recursion" by Blake Crouch Crown, 336 pages, $27, June 11: Last fall, Netflix scooped up the rights to Blake Crouch's "Recursion," which will be developed into a feature film and TV series - and the book isn't out until mid-June. The latest novel from the author of the Wayward Pines trilogy is part sci-fi thriller and part police procedural, with a little romance thrown in for good measure. Starring New York City cop Barry Sutton and brilliant neuroscientist Helena Smith, it explores the lengths people will go to preserve their most precious memories - or, given the chance, reinvent them entirely.
"Fleishman Is in Trouble" by Taffy Brodesser-Akner Random House, 384 pages, $27, June 18: Taffy Brodesser-Akner, a staff writer for The New York Times Magazine, tackles marriage, divorce, ambition and identity in her debut novel. When Toby Fleishman and his wife of more than 14 years, Rachel, decide to separate, the Manhattan hepatologist assumes he knows what he's in for: co-parenting their preteen kids, a chance to put himself out there on dating apps, etc. His assumptions are upended when Rachel drops off their children at his place and ghosts.
"The Vagabonds" by Jeff Guinn Simon & Schuster, 320 pages, $28, July 9: Summer road trips weren't always the popular American pastime they are today. Back when cars were unreliable and roads barely passable, they were downright impractical. So it was a big deal when Henry Ford, Thomas Edison and tire-maker Harvey Firestone decided to spend a series of summers from 1915 to 1925 road tripping around the country. Though the self-described "Vagabonds" traveled with chefs, butlers and other personnel (not exactly roughing it), their ultimate mission was to assess American roadways and drive the automobile straight into ubiquity.
"The Need" by Helen Phillips Simon & Schuster, 272 pages, $26, July 9: The author of "The Beautiful Bureaucrat" returns with an existential thriller that unearths truths about modern motherhood. Molly is a paleobotanist at a fossil quarry and mom to two young children whose life turns upside down when an intruder wearing a deer mask confronts her in her home.
"On the Clock" by Emily Guendelsberger Little, Brown, 352 pages, $28, July 16: In a timely and important look at the harsh realities of the modern American workplace, journalist Emily Guendelsberger recounts her experiences doing hourly labor all over the country. Threatened by automation, low-wage jobs have become all about efficiency but at the cost of humanity. Her question: How can we make such work more humane?
"The Nickel Boys" by Colson Whitehead Doubleday, 224 pages, $24.95, July 16: A great deal of buzz surrounds Colson Whitehead's follow-up to "The Underground Railroad," his searing 2016 novel that won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction, the National Book Award and the Chicago Tribune Heartland Literary Prize. Set in Jim Crow-era Florida, his new book centers on two boys sentenced to a juvenile reformatory where abuse, assault and corruption run rampant. Whitehead based the nightmarish Nickel Academy on a real reform school that used to operate in Florida.
"Three Women" by Lisa Taddeo Avid Reader, 320 pages, $27, July 27: For this impressive feat of narrative nonfiction, Lisa Taddeo spent nearly a decade with a high school student in North Dakota, an entrepreneur in Seattle and a homemaker in suburban Indiana to write an immersive account of the sex lives of ordinary American women. Critics are already raving about this carefully crafted portrait of female desire.
"Trick Mirror" by Jia Tolentino Random House, 304 pages, $27, Aug. 6: Jia Tolentino's incisive cultural commentary has graced the pages of The New Yorker, the NPR airwaves and even the recent "Fyre Fraud" documentary. Soon, her deft insights arrive in book form with "Trick Mirror," an essay collection that probes these precarious times - scams, the devolution of the internet, our optimization fixation - to consider how a near-constant focus on self warps our vision.
"Coventry" by Rachel Cusk FSG, 256 pages, $27, Aug. 20: Rachel Cusk is admired for her heady autofiction, particularly the much-talked-about Outline trilogy. Now a new collection of nonfiction - covering everything from art and family life to feminism and politics - allows Cusk fans a chance to jump back inside her brilliant brain.
"How to Be an Antiracist" by Ibram X. Kendi One World, 320 pages, $27, Aug. 20: Ibram X. Kendi - author of "Stamped from the Beginning: The Definitive History of Racist Ideas in America," which won a 2016 National Book Award for Nonfiction - turns his attention toward achieving a more just and equitable future. Blending memoir, social commentary, history and science, "How to Be an Antiracist" seeks to reshape the conversation about racial justice in America: from how not to be racist, to how to be an antiracist.
"Everything Inside" by Edwidge Danticat Knopf, 240 pages, $25.95, Aug. 27: Edwidge Danticat, the acclaimed author of such works as "Brother, I'm Dying" and "Claire of the Sea Light," situates her new story collection in Miami, Port-au-Prince and an unnamed Caribbean country. These eight intimate stories confront everything from birth to death, fractured relationships to unlikely reunions.
"Five Days Gone" by Laura Cumming Scribner, 320 pages, $26, Aug. 27: Every family has its secrets but, as Laura Cumming discovered, some are more unsettling than others. The art critic for The Observer learned, half a century after the fact, that when her mother was 3 years old, she was kidnapped from a beach in England and not found for several days. No one was accused of a crime. Cumming revisits the mystery of her late mother's life.

Texto completo: About the last thing a dressing room is is the room where actors get dressed. First, it's where they get undressed. It's where, along with extraneous layers of clothing, they remove the extraneous layers of self they bring into the theater. It's where they take themselves off. When I used to visit backstages frequently as part of my job, I saw performers in every kind of semi-nudity. It's no different now: Coed locker-room shamelessness is the rule. In the long galleys where ensemble members prepare, there's really no choice -- no privacy, no modesty. Men parade in their dance belts, and women in silk robes casually gapping. The chatter down the row of mirrors is just as uninhibited. But even in the star quarters, which are rarely as glamorous as one might wish, actors spend less time putting on makeup than scraping off their public personas. One star who invited me to drop by -- a soignée veteran of musicals that regularly featured her in sequins -- enjoyed her dressing room as a place to release her inner grandma. She wore flowery housecoats and fluffy slippers. When I followed another into her windowless new palace on the first day of stage rehearsals, she did not quail at its industrial-strength ugliness but did gasp at the floor-to-ceiling mirrors a previous tenant had glued to a wall. She asked her assistant whether they might be ripped down or covered up. A dressing room was no place to see oneself. Not everyone feels this way. Some dressing rooms are shrines to self-love, certainly. It takes a lot for an actor to throw away flowers dangling notes of praise. More often, though, dressing rooms are other things: nurseries, clubhouses, makeshift trysting spots. Conference centers for hash-outs with agitated authors. Publicity offices with stacks of photos that still need signing. Impromptu rehearsal studios. Kennels. Napatoriums for two-show days. Ramen kitchens, botánicas, graveyards for humidifiers. More pertinently, they are assembly lines for reinvention. Even if actors arrive solo, sometimes hours before curtain, they aren't alone for long. Here come the wig handler, the dresser, the sound technician with his condom-wrapped microphone packs. Knock, knock: It's the director's assistant with a performance note. The co-star complaining about last night's stepped-on joke. But at some point, dressing rooms are places of silent, solitary work. Except for the Elphabas of "Wicked," who need mechanical green-spraying, most actors put on their own makeup; it's part of a tradition going back to the ancients. A designer will usually have provided the template; many's the facial diagram I've seen perched on the mirror showing exactly how the transformation should happen. The magic isn't in the mascara. Nor is it to be found, at least not at first, in anything that's added. It's in what's taken away. In front of the dressing room mirror, an actor's own hair will often be secreted in a stocking cap, his 5 o'clock shadow spackled away, her freckles powdered to nothing. Looking at themselves disappearing, they may find their character getting ready to enter. Later come the costumes and warm-ups, the guests and Champagne -- even the press. In the following pages we see how photographers for The New York Times over the years have caught classic performers (and some more recent ones, too, in the same theaters) in the act of becoming someone. But first, before they can become someone, they have to become no one. Jesse Green is the co-chief theater critic for The New York Times

US ambassador says Israel 'has the right to retain some' of the West Bank

Texto completo: President Trump’s administration won’t “prejudge” an Israeli effort to annex settlements in the West Bank, according to the top U.S. envoy to Israel.
David Friedman
“I think Israel has the right to retain some, but unlikely all, of the West Bank,” Ambassador David Friedman told the New York Times.
Friedman’s comments could give momentum to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s campaign season pledge to “extend sovereignty” over land that the United Nations has designated “occupied Palestinian territory.” He is a key member of a team led by Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner that has been crafting a closely held proposal to broker a peace deal between the Israelis and the Palestinians.
“We really don’t have a view until we understand how much, on what terms, why does it make sense, why is it good for Israel, why is it good for the region, why does it not create more problems than it solves,” Friedman said. “These are all things that we’d want to understand, and I don’t want to prejudge.”
Israeli incursions into the West Bank culminated in outgoing President Barack Obama’s decision to allow the U.N. Security Council to pass a resolution condemning the expansion of the settlements in December of 2016. Trump’s team denounced Obama’s refusal to veto the resolution, but Kushner tapped the brakes on Netanyahu’s annexation proposal during a recent discussion of his peace plan.
“I hope both sides will take a real look at it, the Israeli and the Palestinian side, before any unilateral steps are made,” Kushner said last month.
Those comments, however, came before Netanyahu failed to strike an agreement with rival political parties to form a governing majority of the Israeli legislature. Netanyahu’s allies promptly moved to schedule new elections, which could put Kushner under pressure to postpone unveiling his plan until November.
“Certainly Israel’s entitled to retain some portion of it,” Friedman said in the newly published interview.

Texto completo: Dance has been a part of Derek Hough's life since he was a child, but he is also an accomplished musician, actor and singer. In his new stage show, "Derek Hough Live! The Tour," he showcases his many talents and opens up with audiences on a more personal level.
Hough is best known as a cast member on "Dancing With the Stars," a TV competition he has won six times. He won two Emmy Awards for his choreography on the show. He recently served as a judge alongside Jennifer Lopez and Ne-Yo on the TV show "World of Dance."
He has played Corny Collins in "Hairspray Live!," been the male lead in a London production of "Footloose" and had a recurring role on the TV show "Nashville." His book "Taking the Lead: Lessons from a Life in Motion" was a New York Times bestseller.
This tour is a different experience for Hough, who is used to working with his sister. In 2014, 2015 and 2017, he toured with Julianne Hough, also an accomplished dancer, actress and singer.
His new show isn't just him on stage alone, though. He has dancers and a band. The show crosses genres, presenting Motown, Latin, rock-and-roll, big band, hip hop and other styles of music and dance. Hough plays the guitar and drums, along with singing and dancing.
He talked about his solo tour during a recent telephone interview.
Question: How have audiences been responding to your tour?
Answer: The audiences' response, the reactions, the reviews have been overwhelming. I've worked so hard on this show, putting together something that appeals to such a wide demographic, everybody from kids to 90-year-olds and everybody in between.
I really get personal, and I get quite vulnerable in the show towards the end, having a chat. The response so far from everybody has been just beautiful. I'll sign autographs and sign posters after the show, and I ask a lot of people what's their favorite part.
What's so wonderful to hear is everybody has a different favorite part that they love the most. Some will be in tears from the emotional parts of the show, and some are having a blast, having fun, standing up and dancing. It captures all of the different emotions.
Q: Do you feel it's changed how people look at you?
A: There's a lot of singing in the show. I do "Singin' in the Rain," Michael Buble songs and some Top 40 stuff. It's wonderful to share that aspect of what I do as well.
For me to have done so many different tours and for people to come up to me and say that they really, really loved this one, it just makes me so happy. I'm always trying to get better and better, elevate and make the best show possible for these audiences.
Q: What went into choosing the dancers for your show?
A: I picked dancers that can do things that I can't. There's certain things that I'm an expert at, and there are certain areas that aren't necessarily my strongest areas. Every night, I'm blown away by what they are producing on that stage, just their technique, their grace and their athleticism.
Q: When you were getting ready for the show, did it feel different working with them compared to your sister?
A: The biggest difference was trying to figure out how I was going to be onstage for the entire time, or where I was going to not be onstage. It was very important for me to have dancers who were so good that it didn't matter if I was onstage or not.
Also, the one big change for this show is I have a live band. That was a big part of the process. It took a lot more thought, a lot more time. I did all the arrangements and was in the recording studio, putting together music. The band was rehearsing, and we were dancing in the room. What it has done is it has made the show feel more like a concert.
Q: How long did it take to put together the show?
A: It took a long time. The thing that took the longest was the music, getting the music and the set list together. I wanted such a big variety of music that covers the whole spectrum of genres and music that inspires us to move and dance. Also, I wanted to pick music that was meant to be played live. I wanted this music to really pop and really feel exciting when you hear it.
Q: How did you decide what music to use?
A: I picked music that I get excited about but also music that I know that my audience will love as well, infusing them, combining them, updating some of them, changing some of these songs and making them feel more contemporary. For me, what's awesome is after the show having a 6-year-old come up to me and say how much she loved the music and, in the same moment, having a 70-year-old come up to me and say how much she loved the music.
Q: Did you have to brush up on any dance styles for the show?
A: I tap a lot in the show. For me, I love tap dancing so much. I had to definitely work hard on brushing up on my tap. I do a really challenging routine in the show. It's very demanding, very physical. Fortunately, I keep sharp in my styles and what I do, and I work hard, train and practice a lot. When it came to rehearsal, I was ready to go.
Q: It sounds like you've really challenged and pushed yourself with this show.
A: This definitely is a challenging show for everybody, including our dancers. The dancers are working extremely hard. It's a full-out show. When people come and see the show, I think they're surprised by the amount of energy that is exerted on that stage.
Q: What do you hear consistently that audiences always love and get excited about?
A: There's a moment where I get really personal. I really open up about struggles that I've gone through and how we all share this vulnerability. We all share these thoughts, these doubts in our mind. I've really heard from a lot of people that it touched them. It really moved them tremendously. That's my goal. I really just want to inspire, motivate or connect with the audience.
Q: Have your dancers and band helped to shape the show?
A: A lot of the big moments, it could only happen because of the talent of the musicians or the dancers. Being a choreographer isn't just about creating moves that you want to see. It's about bringing the best out in who you have. A lot of times, I will say, "Do something amazing here," and they will do something that is in their wheelhouse and only they can bring that to the table. There are so many of those moments that each dancer brings that couldn't have happened without them.

Texto completo: The White House is moving forward with plans to significantly weaken vehicle pollution standards, rejecting a last-minute appeal to President Trump by some of the world's largest car manufacturers to restart negotiations with California.
White House Deputy Press Secretary Judd Deere said Friday that California's top air quality regulator had failed to propose a "productive alternative" to the administration's plan to ease requirements for tailpipe emissions and fuel economy standards.
"We are moving forward to finalize a rule with the goal of promoting safer, cleaner, and more affordable vehicles," he said in a statement.

The administration's proposal would undo one of the most significant environmental regulations put in place under President Obama -- rules that sought to cut down on vehicle emissions, improve fuel efficiency and forestall the worst effects of climate change.
The regulations require car manufacturers to build increasingly efficient vehicles so that by 2025 the nation's cars and trucks would average more than 50 miles per gallon.
After automakers complained that the Obama standards were too strict, the Trump administration decided to rewrite the regulations. But the results were too extreme even for the car manufacturers.
On Thursday, 17 major automakers including General Motors, Ford, Nissan and Toyota asked Trump in a letter to reopen talks with California, which has authority under the Clean Air Act to set its own tailpipe emission regulations.
They warned the president that his administration's plan to weaken car pollution regulations and fuel efficiency standards would hurt car companies' bottom lines and could produce "untenable" instability.
The car manufacturers also wrote to California Gov. Gavin Newsom, asking the state to reach a compromise with the Trump administration that would lower the annual vehicle fuel economy targets without completely gutting the current regulations.
Talks between the Trump administration and California air quality regulators broke down in February, with each side accusing the other of being unwilling to negotiate.
It took less than 24 hours for the White House to reject the automakers' request. Analysts were not surprised at the quick dismissal.
"This seems like a bit of theater -- automakers likely never expected 11th-hour negotiations to resume anyway, but can now try to claim credit for trying," said Shannon Baker-Branstetter, a transportation policy advocate for Consumer Reports.
"It was the automakers themselves who asked for a rollback in the first place, and whether it's their own proposal to weaken standards or the administration's complete rollback, American consumers lose out and will be spending more on fuel for decades to come," she added.
Under Trump, the agencies have proposed freezing mileage targets at about 37 miles per gallon for cars after 2020. In addition to ending California's unique authority to set its own, tougher greenhouse gas emissions standards, the plan would nullify the state mandate that automakers sell a certain number of electric vehicles.
Official projections show the administration's plan would increase daily gas consumption across the United States by about 500,000 barrels a day, worsening greenhouse gas emissions and contributing to the rise in global temperatures.
The car industry isn't the only one that has lobbied for weaker tailpipe regulations.
The New York Times found that oil industry groups -- in particular, Marathon Petroleum, the country's largest refiner -- joined forces with conservative policy organizations to push the administration to roll back vehicle emission standards.
The final version of the administration's plan is expected to be released this summer. California officials have said they are prepared to sue the federal government if it moves forward with weakening the regulations.
"I remember the days of intense smog and vehicle pollution in California, when you couldn't see beyond two blocks in parts of Los Angeles," said Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.). "California is now in the vanguard of fighting climate change, and reducing auto emissions is critical to that effort. We're not going to backtrack."
As the possibility of a drawn-out legal battle increases, advocates on both sides of the dispute have said it could wind up at the Supreme Court, potentially reopening an argument over a previous ruling that found that the Environmental Protection Agency had authority to regulate greenhouse gases.

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO -- A month after Uber's rocky initial public offering, its chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, is taking tighter control over the company.
Mr. Khosrowshahi pushed out two members of his executive team: Barney Harford, the company's chief operating officer, and Rebecca Messina, the chief marketing officer, the company told employees on Friday.
Since Mr. Khosrowshahi was appointed chief executive more than two years ago, he has spent much of his time on a global apology tour to clean up the company's image and install more professional management at the fast-growing, ride-hailing company.
After a series of scandals in 2017 that led to the ouster of its former chief executive, Travis Kalanick, Uber's reputation had become badly tarnished. Mr. Khosrowshahi tried to turn that around by promising to work more closely with regulators and to improve management of the company.
Hiring a chief operating officer -- something Uber's critics and its own board said the company desperately needed -- was considered a key part of that repair process.
Now, pushing out Mr. Harford and Ms. Messina is another potential setback in Mr. Khosrowshahi's effort to clean up Uber's reputation and its financial performance.
"There's never really a right time to announce departures or changes like this, but with the I.P.O. behind us, I felt this was a good moment to simplify our org and set us up for the future," Mr. Khosrowshahi wrote in an internal email announcing the executive departures.
Mr. Harford and Ms. Messina could not be immediately reached for comment Friday evening. But Mr. Harford thanked Mr. Khosrowshahi on Twitter, saying, "It has been an honor."
As Uber prepared to go public earlier this year, it became clear that Wall Street was leery of Uber's steep losses and its lack of a clear path to profitability.
In early May, Uber's I.P.O. performed well below expectations. The price of an Uber share fell below the offering price, $ 45 a share, on the first day of trading and continued to drop, before climbing out of the hole earlier this week.
Uber's share price was $ 44.16 at the end of trading Friday. It was down about 1 percent in after-hours trading.
Mr. Khosrowshahi appointed Mr. Harford, who had been the chief executive at the travel site Orbitz, as chief operating officer of Uber in December 2017.
Mr. Harford quickly ran into problems. Employees complained he frequently made insensitive comments around race and gender during company meetings, according to three people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not allowed to discuss the matter publicly.
Last year, The New York Times reported Mr. Harford was subject to an internal investigation over what some perceived were insensitive comments around race and gender. The inquiry was ended internally and Mr. Harford pledged to undergo sensitivity training. Mr. Khosrowshahi pledged to keep Mr. Harford on at the company afterward.
The departure will mean more direct responsibility for Mr. Khosrowshahi over the company's daily operations.
"I now have the ability to be even more involved in the day-to-day operations of our biggest businesses, the core platform of Rides and Eats, and have decided they should report directly to me," Mr. Khosrowshahi wrote.
Mr. Khosrowshahi also announced plans to consolidate Uber's marketing and policy teams, removing Ms. Messina and promoting Jill Hazelbaker, Uber's senior vice president of policy and communications, to take over the new group.
"Our brand continues to be challenged," Mr. Khosrowshahi said in his email to employees.

For War of Will, an Exercise in What Might Have Been

Texto completo: It has been a strange Triple Crown season, one that kicked off with the confusing and disputed disqualification of the apparent Kentucky Derby champion Maximum Security and will end Saturday with the 151st running of the Belmont Stakes.
In between, the owners of Maximum Security filed a federal lawsuit seeking to restore their colt's Derby victory.
Then there are the dead horses --- 27 of them since December -- at Santa Anita Park in California, which have prompted an investigation by the Los Angeles County district attorney's office and calls from elected officials and animal rights activists for the track to be shut down.
Each story line has conspired to overshadow the work of an old-school trainer by the name of Mark Casse to put a talented colt, War of Will, in position to claim a significant piece of history and leave the horse racing world wondering what might have been if not for an unfortunately located puddle.
War of Will, with Tyler Gaffalione aboard, is the only horse among the Belmont's field of 10 to compete in all three legs of this year's Triple Crown. He can become the first horse since Afleet Alex in 2005 to fail to win the Derby but complete a Preakness-Belmont double, a feat that just 12 horses have accomplished.
If War of Will can follow his gritty victory in Baltimore with a win at that grand old racetrack on Long Island, he would take his place alongside immortal thoroughbreds like Man o' War (1920), Native Dancer (1953), Nashua (1955) and Damascus (1967).
"I learned a long time ago to not think about that kind of stuff," Casse said recently. "Right now, the only thing I'm focusing on is getting there."
Casse, 58, has had horses in plenty of big races. He is a member of Canada's racing Hall of Fame and a six-time Sovereign Award winner for outstanding trainer in that country. But it took Casse 40 years and a determined burst up the rail by War of Will in the Preakness to capture his first victory in a Triple Crown race.
It was a testament to Casse's horsemanship that War of Will was even in the starting gate for any of the Triple Crown races, let alone all of them.
In March, War of Will was considered a top 3-year-old and Derby threat after running away with the Le Comte and Risen Star Stakes at the Fairgrounds in New Orleans. After a ninth-place finish in the Louisiana Derby, however, Casse discovered that War of Will had strained his right hind patellar ligament shortly after breaking from the gate.
Casse was already playing catch up with War of Will. The colt's first four races were on turf, a sensible decision considering that the colt's sire, War Front, was an accomplished grass horse and his offspring are having huge success on that surface in Europe as well as in America.
But Casse did not panic. He gave War of Will some time off and brought him back slowly.
The colt not only made it to the starting gate of the Kentucky Derby but looked as if he had an opportunity to win the race when Gaffalione seemed to have found another gear as they turned for home at Churchill Downs.
Instead, they tangled with Maximum Security when the leader hopped a puddle and veered out. Gaffalione was fortunate to stay in the saddle, and War of Will demonstrated tremendous athleticism in staying on his feet and averting what could have been a multiple-horse pileup.
Neither Casse nor Gaffalione filed an objection about the incident. Casse and Maximum Security's trainer Jason Servis are friends, and he was loath to ruin one of the biggest moments in a trainer's life so his horse could get moved up to seventh or eighth place.
"They had to take him down," Casse said. "A lot of people said the best horse won; you know, maybe he did. But we would have liked the chance."
So while Gary and Mary West, Maximum Security's owners, took their fight to courts, and Country House, the Derby runner-up who was declared the winner, got sick, Casse kept War of Will on the Triple Crown trail.
His colt scooted up the rail for an emphatic length-and-a-quarter win in the Preakness, putting Gaffalione and Casse in the winner's circle of an American Classic for the first time.
"I like to run my horses when they are doing well," he said.
In the three weeks since his Preakness triumph, Casse said War of Will had gained almost 50 pounds and was getting stronger. (For casual sports fans who might associate putting on weight in-season with too much time at the dessert table, worry not. Triple Crown races are for 3-year-olds, who are still growing and maturing, and gaining weight is a sign of that.)
He will have to overcome some formidable foes, notably Tacitus, a colt that has been training sharply at Belmont Park since finishing third in the Derby.
"When the Derby and Preakness winners are here and get beat, it's usually by a Belmont-based horse," said Casse. "There's an advantage to it."
The grueling mile-and-a-half distance on Belmont's big sweeping track has earned the race its nickname: the Test of the Champion.
Casse believes that in War of Will he has a colt who can ace that challenge. The colt has taken his share of lumps throughout the spring, and yes, he has been overlooked as controversies and tragedies have overcome the sport.
"But I've had this since the beginning, that great horses can win when things aren't perfect," Casse said. "Is it ideal? No. Can he win? Absolutely."

Texto completo: At the beginning of the second act of "Oklahoma!," the audience is greeted with a dance: A young woman - bald, powerfully built and wearing a sequined shirt that says "Dream Baby Dream"
- appears, surrounded by swirling fog, as if she were a mirage.
That dancer, Gabrielle Hamilton, runs, prances, twists violently from side to side and pauses to stare boldly at audience members. Her presence, uninhibited and raw, is meant to shake things up. This may be Broadway, but the dream ballet in Daniel Fish's brilliantly reimagined "Oklahoma!" is ages from the usual step-ball-change kind of dance found there. And that's wonderful.
Why has it stirred up such strong reactions, with audience members loving or hating it? Clearly, it strays from the norm. It's unnerving. And it's not afraid of looking ugly. That its choreographer, John Heginbotham, wasn't nominated for a Tony Award seems both shocking and not at all surprising.
The frustrating part about Broadway dance isn't that there is no choreography of quality, but that what's excellent - "Oklahoma!" and, in another register, "The Prom" - isn't being recognized. But standard fare, or worse, slight fare, receives nominations. The main exception is Camille A. Brown's defiant choreography for the play "Choir Boy."
Brown shares the nomination for best choreographer with four others: Warren Carlyle for "Kiss Me, Kate"; Denis Jones for "Tootsie"; David Neumann for "Hadestown"; and Sergio Trujillo for "Ain't Too Proud: The Life and Times of the Temptations." The ceremony will be held June 9, and I'm rooting for Brown.
Like Heginbotham in "Oklahoma!," Brown brings something urgent and fresh to Broadway dance. It's fitting that both come out of the modern dance world. They aren't commercially inclined; for each, the work is the work, an intimate process between a choreographer and dancers. They serve their shows, not by illustrating or commenting on the story, but by revealing the emotion behind the narrative in ways that words or music alone cannot.
In Tarell Alvin McCraney's "Choir Boy," Brown uses step, in which the body becomes a percussive instrument, to help tell the story of a group of African American students enrolled at a private school. They don't all get along, but when they dance, they form a brotherhood. When they dance, they seem like more than just characters; their synchronized movements remind us of the pain but also of the dignity of being black men in America.
In "Kiss Me, Kate," Carlyle's throwback to classic musical theater spotlights a lengthy number, "Too Darn Hot." It's spirited but derivative, a lively centerpiece in a fairly tepid show; while it honors the idea of Broadway dance with its brush strokes of tap and jazz, it feels archaic - full of energy and smiles, but little substance.
The choreography in "Ain't Too Proud," which features the nimble Jeremy Pope - he also starred in "Choir Boy" - is affectingly seamless. Here, Trujillo gives the stylized steps more punch and intricacy than they had when the group was in its heyday, and it works: his synchronized movement knits the songs together with flair.
But the choreography, inextricably wedded to the music, happens in fits and starts; it hits the spot but carries none of the weight of the dream ballet in "Oklahoma!" or of the multitude of dances in "The Prom," another show that wasn't nominated for its choreography. In this delight of a musical comedy, the dancing is integrated from beginning to end as the movement switches between hip-hop and musical-theater forms. One elevates the other, and Casey Nicholaw, its director and choreographer, isn't afraid of being funny. (Nicholaw was nominated for best director.)
Instead, another, less-funny musical comedy was nominated, "Tootsie." The liveliest number here seemingly takes inspiration from the film "The Birdcage," when Robin Williams, as club proprietor Armand Goldman, puts his body through en encyclopedic array of motions - hip swivels, convulsions, vogueing - while calling out references: "Fosse, Fosse, Fosse! You do Martha Graham, Martha Graham, Martha Graham! Or Twyla, Twyla, Twyla! Or Michael Kidd, Michael Kidd, Michael Kidd, Michael Kidd! Or Madonna, Madonna, Madonna!"
In "Tootsie," bodies swish - unremarkably - to a similar set of instructions by fictional director Ron Carlisle (Reg Rogers) to his cast: "Bounce bounce bounce bounce, Fosse arm, Fosse arm, restless leg yeah, change the light bulb." It goes on much longer, but you get the gist and are probably asking the same question: How does taking a choreographic idea from a film and putting it into a Broadway musical about another film warrant a Tony nomination? And then there is "Hadestown," the contemporary retelling of the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice. The mystery of that show - which, like "Oklahoma!," made the leap from the downtown, more experimental world to Broadway - is its appeal. As far as movement is concerned, the only compelling performer onstage is actor André De Shields, who can simply stand and make stillness gorgeous. When he walks, it's as if he were gliding. The man floats.
The "Hadestown" choreography is by Neumann, who is also known for his time in the modern dance world. But his contribution is mechanical and overwrought. The dancers circle the stage like pieces of machinery; the way they use the weight of their bodies - even when they jump or flow from one side of the stage to the other - is sticky with melodrama. You sense everything coming before it has arrived.
As Orpheus, Reeve Carney, with his raised shoulders and arms held slightly behind his back, mirrors the stance of Neumann in his dancing days. You can sense how closely they worked together, but the effect is contrived, as is the busy choreography for the group known as the Workers Chorus. These are dancers trying so hard to be seen that they're distracting.
That sort of look-at-me behavior happens in "Kiss Me, Kate" and "Tootsie," too. What Hamilton illustrates in "Oklahoma!" is diametrically different: The choreography grants her the ability to move like lightning but also to be patient.
Heginbotham has said he was inspired by remarks made by Agnes de Mille, who created the original choreography for the show in 1943. Speaking to a group of dance students, she once said: "Take your time. Beginners are always afraid of taking time. They think nothing's happening. Time is happening, and it works in suspense. Time can work for you as actively as a gesture if you know how to use it."

Texto completo: Sen. Rand Paul is calling for immediate revocation of former CIA Director John Brennan's security clearance, for real this time.
"Disgraceful, extent to which the deep state will go to protect their own," the Kentucky Republican tweeted Friday, referring to the notion that federal or military officials are undermining a democratically elected government.Tweet"I was in the Oval Office w/@realDonaldTrump when he directed officials to revoke John Brennan’s security clearance. A partisan hack & mouthpiece for the media has no business holding a clearance," Paul added. "Revoke now!"
President Trump announced in August that Brennan's security clearance was being stripped due to "erratic behavior" that disqualified him from having access to sensitive information. But the White House never followed through with the complicated bureaucratic process of revocation, a source told the New York Times in a report published last month.
A close ally of the president, Paul told CNN this week he hopes Trump will conduct a search to find out who defied his order last year.
Brennan has been an outspoken critic of Trump and his tendency to question the motives of members of the U.S. intelligence community. He recently said he hopes Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and CIA Director Gina Haspel will "stand up" to Trump's "unprecedented act" of granting Attorney General William Barr "full and complete authority to declassify information" related to the origins of the federal investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.

Let's ditch Mitch McConnell

Texto completo: OK, throwing this one at you without warning: What's your opinion of Mitch McConnell?
A) Spawn of Satan.
B) Sort of pitiful, what with having Donald Trump on his back.
C) Can we talk about how he looks like a turtle?
Definitely not the last one. It's true that many Americans think of McConnell as turtle-like, due to his lack of anything resembling a chin.
But this is wrong on two counts. First, you shouldn't tackle people you disagree with by making fun of their looks.
Second, it gives turtles a bad name. Turtles are great for the environment and everybody likes them. They sing to their children. You are never going to see a turtle killing gun control legislation.
Mitch, on the other hand, has a longstanding alliance with the National Rifle Association, which has shown its affection to the tune of about $1.3 million in support. Anything the NRA dislikes never gets the chance to come up for a Senate vote. Reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act is moldering away in a corner because the NRA doesn't want authorities taking guns away from domestic abusers.
It's been another terrible year of mass shooting violence. One simple, very popular response would be to improve the background checks for gun purchases. It would at least show our elected officials care about the crisis.
Such a bill passed the House of Representatives and went to the Senate where it's, um, laying around somewhere. "There's a whole bunch of Republican support, but he won't let it move to the floor," said minority leader Chuck Schumer.
This goes on a lot. McConnell, who has near total control over what comes up for a vote, sits on things he doesn't like until they smother. Farewell, immigration reform, Paycheck Fairness Act, legislation protecting Americans with pre-existing conditions, lowering prescription drug prices, protecting election security, restoring net neutrality.
You can, of course, just presume that McConnell is following Trump's orders. But it's hard to believe the president even knows what's going on. This week, when he was in Europe, Trump twittered congratulations to the House on the passage of a huge disaster aid package, adding, "Great, now we will get it done in the Senate!" Helpful readers noted that the Senate had approved said bill two weeks before.
There are well over 100 House-passed bills sitting around gathering mildew in Mitch's limbo. What do you think that place looks like? A very depressing bus station waiting room? A hospital ward packed with comatose patients? Or maybe just a dimly lit storage bin where little bills sit around drinking juice and playing video games until the end of time?
All of them in the thrall of Mitch McConnell. Before we move on, can we mention that McConnell's wife, Elaine Chao, is the nation's secretary of transportation, and possibly on her way to serious contention for Worst Cabinet Member?
Check out the Times story by Michael Forsythe and Eric Lipton that detailed how Chao, during the performance of her duties promoting the American maritime industry, has also been lending a helping hand to her own family's very extensive shipping business, which builds most of its fleet in China. Her family has made more than $1 million in campaign contributions to the senator. Which is generous, but not quite as impressive as the somewhere between $5 million and $25 million that Chao's father has given his daughter and son-in-law as a flat-out gift.
So McConnell has been doing very well indeed - family money, Senate majority and no irritating votes on stuff he doesn't like. To be fair, he's not the first leader who's pulled that disappearing bill trick. (Possibly the first who enjoys referring to himself as "The Grim Reaper," but that's just part of his colorful personality.) His predecessor, Democrat Harry Reid, did the same thing, although Schumer claims not nearly so much. "There was not a total blanket on anything coming to the floor," Schumer said in a phone interview. "I've never seen anything quite like this."
Well, there's one thing coming to the floor. McConnell is obsessed with cramming the federal judiciary with men and women of a conservative bent. When President Barack Obama was in his second term, McConnell slowed the confirmation process to a mini-crawl, so he was able to gift Trump with more than 100 vacancies to fill.
Most spectacularly of all, when Antonin Scalia died in February of 2016, McConnell completely ignored Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland as his successor.
"Not even holding a hearing on the Garland nomination has to be an absolute landmark in Senate process," said Joshua Huder of the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University.
A man who has never gotten a single vote from anyone living outside the state of Kentucky decreed that a man twice elected president of the United States had no right to have his nominee for Supreme Court considered in the Senate. McConnell told Charles Homans of The Times it was "the most consequential thing" he'd ever done. He was extremely proud.
McConnell's argument was that Obama was too close to the end of his term to make a lifetime appointment to the nation's highest court. But now he's saying that if there's a vacancy before the 2020 election, he'll of course get Trump's choice for a successor a confirmation vote. "Oh, we'd fill it," the senator chortled at a Chamber of Commerce lunch back home in Kentucky.
I know you're not surprised, but isn't it sort of awful that McConnell's so proud of himself? You'd hope that, at least in public, he'd murmur something vague and look a tad sheepish.
No self-respecting turtle would ever behave like that.

Texto completo: El sistema de recomendaciones de videos de YouTube facilita que los pedófilos hallen videos de niños , denunció un equipo de investigadores que analizó el algoritmo.
Los investigadores afirman que YouTube escoge videos de todos sus archivos, a veces incluso de películas caseras inocuas de familias que no son conscientes de ello . En muchos casos, el algoritmo refería a los usuarios a los videos después de ver contenido de temática sexual .
El algoritmo de Youtube usa inteligencia artificial y es el responsable del 70% de las reproducciones de videos en la plataforma.
“Es el algoritmo de YouTube que conecta estos canales”, dijo a The New York Times Jonas Kaiser, uno de los tres investigadores del Centro Berkman Klein para Internet y la Sociedad de Harvard que examinó los videos mientras investigaba el impacto de YouTube en Brasil . “Eso es lo que da miedo”.
Así le sucedió a Christiane, una mujer brasileña. El video de su hija y una amiguita jugando en una piscina en el patio de la casa llegó a acumular unas 400 mil vistas.
En febrero YouTube deshabilitó los comentarios en los videos con niños , luego de que varios medios reportaron que eran usados como guía por los pedófilos.
Sin embargo, el sistema de recomendaciones -que usa el mismo algoritmo agrupa- decenas de dichos videos en un nuevo depósito, de fácil acceso, a disposición de una amplia audiencia.
Los pedófilos no necesitan buscar directamente videos de niños, sino que el sistema los va dirigiendo a ellos mediante una cadena de recomendaciones .
Por ejemplo, un pedófilo puede buscar videos de mujeres jóvenes y a partir de allí terminar viendo videos de niñas .
The New York Times alertó a YouTube de que su sistema hacía circular videos familiares entre personas con inclinaciones al parecer pedófilas y la compañía retiró varios de ellos, pero dejó otros , incluso algunos subidos por cuentas aparentemente falsas.
Pese a las críticas, YouTube mantiene su sistema de recomendaciones en videos de niños, a pesar de los pedidos de que lo desactive para disuadir a los pedófilos de buscar materiales sobre menores en la plataforma.

Poet Olivia Romo sings to the acequias

Texto completo: The first thing that farmer, poet and water rights activist Olivia Romo wants Tempo readers to know about her is that she is very proud of being a Taoseña.
"I am truly indebted to my community and parents who have taught me the literacy of the land, our culture, and to acknowledge our history that has shaped my identity and pathway as a young woman," she said.
Romo holds a dual bachelor's degree in English and Chicana/o Studies from the University of New Mexico and is the communications and outreach coordinator at the New Mexico Acequia Association.
"The most significant part of my job is to work with our people and in the most sacred and remote parts of our state," she said in Spanish. (She switches easily and gracefully between the languages.) "Our way of life here in New Mexico is at risk and through my job I feel confident I am helping our traditional people stay on the land and have the tools to continue managing their acequias."
Romo was the New Mexico State Slam Poetry Champion in 2011 and was recently featured in "Work Songs of the Cowboy Poets" in The New York Times .
"It was a huge honor to be recognized among critically acclaimed land-based poets and musicians who have a strong presence in the National Cowboy Poetry scene," she said. "It is humbling to know that I am trusted to represent New Mexico and share our stories. I can only hope to pay homage and uplift our experiences as New Mexicans. Put us on the map!"
You can find a copy of Romo's Spoken Word CD "Raíces" at SOMOS or contact her at poetadelatierra8@gmail.com. You can also check out her poem " Bendición del agua " at westernfolklife.org/benedicion-del-agua .
When did you know you were a poet?
My mom, who was a schoolteacher, always encouraged me to write and express myself through song, theater and writing short stories. She is my biggest champion and has my heart! However, it wasn't until high school when I was a student of [Taos High School teacher] Anne MacNaughton when I actually began to identify as a poet. The slam poetry movement gave me a platform to tell my story to gain confidence in my voice.
This confidence is reflected in your poetry. Can you share what inspires you?
Of course, my surroundings, my community and the history. Every place I travel in New Mexico I find crazy characters and juicy stories. I don't need to go looking far. One of my mentors as a young high school student, Francis Hahn, told me, "Olivia, write what you know." I did and look how far it has taken me. Some may call me a "regional poet" but I can communicate global, political and archetypal issues through my work and enter dialogues with other artists and activists fluidly.
"Agua es vida.""Agua es comunidad." How do you relate to these statements?
The acequia system is based on community participation and strength. We are probably one of the last peoples in the United States that still govern communally, have local autonomy over our water and an enduring tradition of sharing this scarce resource. We are one with water and place. I use my poetry to demonstrate the symbiotic relationship we have as traditional people with land, water and one another in order to survive. Poetry, music and powerful cinematography can move hearts, restore querencia and educate people about the changes we are experiencing. Water is community, water is life, water is poetry in action. Art is one of the most powerful ways to communicate the problems we face and to celebrate the resilience of the people.
You are a poet, activist and have a full-time job. How do you find the right balance between work and art?
Con el poder de Dios pido cada día la fuerza para trabajar, escribir y prestar servicio a mi comunidad . (With the power of God I ask each day for strength to work, write and serve my community.) I can't do it all and I find myself struggling every day to find time to write, go months without writing or have to turn away opportunities or projects. But I just pray that God gives me the right words so that when I do sit at my desk or am out in these beautiful acequia communities even just 20 minutes will give me a strong poem.
How does magical realism inform your work in both poetry and films?
I am a believer in the powerful spirit, energy and magic of this place and our people. We need to be creative in solving modern-day problems and some of my stories demonstrate miracles asking advice from the animals and divine intervention. One new poem I have written titled "Roadrunner, The Chosen Prophet" talks about a magical journey the bird takes to deliver a message to some cowboys out in the desert, ultimately changing history. Magical realism turns the common person into a superhero, the desert animal [into] a prophet or engineer and the natural elements [into] characters with human qualities, which I think, are more realistic than we want to believe.
The manito dialect and culture of Northern New Mexico is a key element in your work. How do you define it, for those who aren't familiar with the term?
The term manitos is one of endearment and kinship and derives from the Spanish word hermano , "brother" or "sibling," inclusive of both brother and sister. It was given by Mexican immigrants to the Indo-Hispano populations of Northern New Mexico and Southern Colorado as they worked mano a mano, side by side, as sharecroppers. It is a term of identity of those who survived in the mountains and valleys before this territory was Mexico or America. The term mano , hand, celebrates the hands that constructed the plazas, moradas, acequias and turned the earth with pride of their mixed blood regardless of the government, flags and national pressures. The manitos/-as of New Mexico are those who are thriving in the high desert despite the changes of the generations. They are my people.

Texto completo: The emotional bond between parent and child is undernourished. In some cases, the child is starving for eye-to-eye contact with their parent.
Emotional attachment to electronic devices has supplanted attachment with our children.
I am not crying wolf. While at a restaurant, it’s common to see a table where at least one member of a family is mesmerized by their phone, oblivious to those seated across the table.
This emotional detachment is not a new phenomenon. In the early 1960’s, TV time began to replace dinner time conversation. Every day, I witness parents handing their child a cell phone to keep them entertained. The parents meanwhile keep their eyes glued to their phones. Eyes scan, and fingers scroll their phone’s tantalizing menu.
Physically, children are also being robbed, exchanging run and play time to sit and stare time.
Mothers and fathers, fly away home … your children need help to put down their phones.
Ann Redding, Minneapolis
Lacking bite
The Pioneer Press headline (May 30), “Mueller: Charge ‘not an option’,” is more than a bit misleading to the casual reader. It certainly lacks the bite of special counsel Robert Mueller’s public statement to summarize his conclusions. He strongly emphasized the fundamental finding the Russians had clearly attempted to influence the 2016 election to favor Donald Trump. He clarified Department of Justice regulations and interpretation of the constitution that suggest a sitting president could not be indicted of criminal activity. Equally important Mueller said he stood by the report and the 10 cited incidents that could be viewed as obstruction by Trump. Further, Mueller suggested it was the job of Congress to decide the president’s guilt.
Compare the Pioneer Press headline to these; Washington Post, “No exoneration of Trump;” New York Times, “Mueller; Probe did not clear Trump;” Minneapolis Star Tribune, “Mueller: Trump not exonerated.” I think all of these better grab one’s attention and show how Barr’s summary came up short on Trump’s obstruction of justice.
Pete Boelter, North Branch
Not his job
The front page of last Thursday’s Pioneer Press contained a misleading sub headline that is a disservice to the reader.
The front page story “Mueller: Charge ‘not an option’” contained the sub headline “In remarks, he stops short of clearing Trump”
If Mueller stopped short of clearing the president, perhaps the headline writer can inform the readers what Mueller found that was short of clearing the president. Also, it’s not Mueller’s job to clear Trump. Mueller was quoted, in those same remarks, that charging the president was not an option because of federal rules.
Mueller’s jobs was to investigate and present his findings.
His findings concluded there was no collusion (sounds like clearing Trump to me), yet the media finds some fascination on keeping afloat this wasted $25 million taxpayer narrative for the last 2+ years.
My question to the media is this: Will you give Attorney General Barr the same media coverage with his findings on collusion from the deep state and those on the left? Or are your friends off limit to the constant barrage of negative press received by President Trump and the Republican Party?

Texto completo: Dance has been a part of Derek Hough's life since he was a child, but he is also an accomplished musician, actor and singer. In his new stage show, "Derek Hough Live! The Tour," he showcases his many talents and opens up with audiences on a more personal level.
Hough is best known as a cast member on "Dancing With the Stars," a TV competition he has won six times. He won two Emmy Awards for his choreography on the show. He recently served as a judge alongside Jennifer Lopez and Ne-Yo on the TV show "World of Dance."
He has played Corny Collins in "Hairspray Live!," been the male lead in a London production of "Footloose" and had a recurring role on the TV show "Nashville." His book "Taking the Lead: Lessons from a Life in Motion" was a New York Times bestseller.
This tour is a different experience for Hough, who is used to working with his sister. In 2014, 2015 and 2017, he toured with Julianne Hough, also an accomplished dancer, actress and singer.
His new show isn't just him on stage alone, though. He has dancers and a band. The show crosses genres, presenting Motown, Latin, rock-and-roll, big band, hip hop and other styles of music and dance. Hough plays the guitar and drums, along with singing and dancing.
He talked about his solo tour during a recent telephone interview.
Question: How have audiences been responding to your tour?
Answer: The audiences' response, the reactions, the reviews have been overwhelming. I've worked so hard on this show, putting together something that appeals to such a wide demographic, everybody from kids to 90-year-olds and everybody in between.
I really get personal, and I get quite vulnerable in the show towards the end, having a chat. The response so far from everybody has been just beautiful. I'll sign autographs and sign posters after the show, and I ask a lot of people what's their favorite part.
What's so wonderful to hear is everybody has a different favorite part that they love the most. Some will be in tears from the emotional parts of the show, and some are having a blast, having fun, standing up and dancing. It captures all of the different emotions.
Q: Do you feel it's changed how people look at you?
A: There's a lot of singing in the show. I do "Singin' in the Rain," Michael Buble songs and some Top 40 stuff. It's wonderful to share that aspect of what I do as well.
For me to have done so many different tours and for people to come up to me and say that they really, really loved this one, it just makes me so happy. I'm always trying to get better and better, elevate and make the best show possible for these audiences.
Q: What went into choosing the dancers for your show?
A: I picked dancers that can do things that I can't. There's certain things that I'm an expert at, and there are certain areas that aren't necessarily my strongest areas. Every night, I'm blown away by what they are producing on that stage, just their technique, their grace and their athleticism.
Q: When you were getting ready for the show, did it feel different working with them compared to your sister?
A: The biggest difference was trying to figure out how I was going to be onstage for the entire time, or where I was going to not be onstage. It was very important for me to have dancers who were so good that it didn't matter if I was onstage or not.
Also, the one big change for this show is I have a live band. That was a big part of the process. It took a lot more thought, a lot more time. I did all the arrangements and was in the recording studio, putting together music. The band was rehearsing, and we were dancing in the room. What it has done is it has made the show feel more like a concert.
Q: How long did it take to put together the show?
A: It took a long time. The thing that took the longest was the music, getting the music and the set list together. I wanted such a big variety of music that covers the whole spectrum of genres and music that inspires us to move and dance. Also, I wanted to pick music that was meant to be played live. I wanted this music to really pop and really feel exciting when you hear it.
Q: How did you decide what music to use?
A: I picked music that I get excited about but also music that I know that my audience will love as well, infusing them, combining them, updating some of them, changing some of these songs and making them feel more contemporary. For me, what's awesome is after the show having a 6-year-old come up to me and say how much she loved the music and, in the same moment, having a 70-year-old come up to me and say how much she loved the music.
Q: Did you have to brush up on any dance styles for the show?
A: I tap a lot in the show. For me, I love tap dancing so much. I had to definitely work hard on brushing up on my tap. I do a really challenging routine in the show. It's very demanding, very physical. Fortunately, I keep sharp in my styles and what I do, and I work hard, train and practice a lot. When it came to rehearsal, I was ready to go.
Q: It sounds like you've really challenged and pushed yourself with this show.
A: This definitely is a challenging show for everybody, including our dancers. The dancers are working extremely hard. It's a full-out show. When people come and see the show, I think they're surprised by the amount of energy that is exerted on that stage.
Q: What do you hear consistently that audiences always love and get excited about?
A: There's a moment where I get really personal. I really open up about struggles that I've gone through and how we all share this vulnerability. We all share these thoughts, these doubts in our mind. I've really heard from a lot of people that it touched them. It really moved them tremendously. That's my goal. I really just want to inspire, motivate or connect with the audience.
Q: Have your dancers and band helped to shape the show?
A: A lot of the big moments, it could only happen because of the talent of the musicians or the dancers. Being a choreographer isn't just about creating moves that you want to see. It's about bringing the best out in who you have. A lot of times, I will say, "Do something amazing here," and they will do something that is in their wheelhouse and only they can bring that to the table. There are so many of those moments that each dancer brings that couldn't have happened without them.

Texto completo: The colossal weight of decades of congressional failure has landed in the tiny border town of Sunland Park, N.M., a bit west of El Paso, Texas.
It arrived, seemingly overnight, in the form of tons of steel and whole lot of hype.
Mayor Javier Perea barely had time to blink.
In the span of a week, national and international press descended. And a ribbon cutting was held on May 30 for what was billed as the nation's first privately built border wall. A GoFundMe account raised the money through the donations of more than 300,000 people giving an average of $67 each to We Build the Wall.
Maybe the gullible donors believed the pontifications delivered by organizers at the dedication. There was the claim that this half of a mile section of 20-foot tall bollards would actually stop the migrants who are streaming to the nearly 2,000-mile long U.S.-Mexico border. Or the more laughable contention that the drug cartels were shuddering at the prospect of everyday Americans donating their hard-earned cash to fund more sections like this on private land.
(Reality check: Mexican drug cartels generally smuggle their shipments of marijuana, heroin, meth, fentanyl and cocaine into the U.S. at official ports of entry. And the seemingly unrelenting numbers of Central Americans seeking asylum are legally presenting themselves to border agents.)
The Sunland Park media circus was orchestrated by an assortment of current and former MAGA luminaries now deemed too radioactive even for the Trump administration.
Kris Kobach, the anti-immigrant zealot and former Kansas secretary of state, was prominent during the week in which the wall appeared, answering media questions.
Kobach is acting as general counsel for We Build the Wall. It's probably the closest he'll get to an official role at the U.S.-Mexico border. Earlier in May, the Trump White House had leaked an embarrassing document said to be from Kobach. It detailed his demands if he was appointed immigration czar, a position that doesn't exist but one that Trump has considered.
Czar Kobach, the New York Times reported, would require access 24/7 to a private jet to whisk him from his Kansas home to Washington and to the border regions. He'd need constant access to the Oval Office, as well as assurances that he could ascend to leading the Department of Homeland Security by the end of 2019. None of it is likely.
Another key mover in the Sunland Park mini-wall is Brian Kolfage Jr., a veteran and triple amputee. He got the crowdfunding, initially intending to donate proceeds to the federal government for Trump to build the wall. Facebook shut down a page that he operated.
Also involved, acting as advisory board chairman, is Steve Bannon, the Breitbart News impresario and Trump campaign and White House adviser. Former Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke was there, too, declaring at the ribbon cutting that while Congress makes excuses, "we get shit done."
Indeed, they put up a wall, complete with lighting and motion sensors, albeit after some back-and-forth with the city over permits. When the mayor issued a temporary order to stop work while he sorted things out, he was met with death threats.
To build the Sunland Park section of the barrier, We Build spent about $7 million of the nearly $23 million Kolfage raised, so the fun's probably not quite over.
Let the eager beavers build their monument to rage and hyper-partisan futility. Let them waste their money and their energy. Let them glory in the manifest idiocy of their project. They decry a do-nothing Congress, yet they fail to recognize the critical role they play in the stalemate.

Texto completo: Regardless of the politics involved, I want to see people reading, writes Liz Soares
CNN host Don Lemon exhorts viewers, on what seems like a regular basis, to read the Mueller report.
As a school librarian, I am intrigued by his plea.
Regardless of the politics involved, I want to see people reading.
Yet the conventional wisdom in pundit-land is that Americans won’t take an interest in special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign and aspects of President Donald Trump’s behavior unless there are televised impeachment hearings, as there were in the Watergate affair.
I well remember watching those hearings back in the 1970s — I was glued to the set — but I also read plenty about the situation. I was taking a high school advanced placement class and had to compare coverage in the conservative National Review and the liberal New Republic. My family took an extended cross-country trip that year, so I had to do this homework in the back of a camper.
Of course, I’m an avid reader who grew up to to be a writer and a librarian. I don’t expect everyone to be as nerdy as me, even the 17-year-old me, who was self-conscious about appearing to be a geek.
Still, I would like to see people reading more, and I don’t mean Twitter and Facebook posts.
“Report on the Investigation into Russian Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election,” also known as the Mueller report, will do. It was on the bestseller lists for a while. But how many people actually have read it? Apparently, not even some key elected officials.
The Washington Post asked House and Senate members of the Judiciary and Intelligence committees if they’d read the report. More than three in 10 “declined to respond to five yes-or-no questions after repeated contact attempts, offered unclear answers or said they have not read the full report.”
Whoa, Nellie.
The NPR show “Hidden Brain” recently did a feature on the decline of local newspapers. Host Shankar Vedantam reported on research showing that, when newspapers close, the affected municipalities borrow money at higher interest rates. The “watchdog” is gone, so municipalities have more leeway to make bad decisions.
There are many reasons why newspapers go out of business, but let’s face it. A major reason is that, when they fail, it’s because fewer people are reading them. That eats away at advertising revenue, etc.
And that’s not the only real-world consequence of people avoiding the written word except in its simplest, easiest-to-digest form. (Yes, Twitter and Facebook).
Post columnist Max Boot recently wrote a piece with the headline “Are we becoming too stupid to govern ourselves?” He discusses anti-vaxxers, conspiracy theorists and Flat Earthers, who obviously are not getting their news from this newspaper, The New York Times or The Wall Street Journal. “One study of the 2016 election found that the 20 top false articles combined on Facebook were shared, reacted to or commented on more widely than the 20 top mainstream news articles combined.”
I bet few of those people reading false articles got beyond the first paragraph. Those “readers” were simply passing along lurid headlines.
The French movie “Non-Fiction” is set in the Parisian publishing world. The characters endlessly discuss people’s reading habits. E-books were supposed to save publishing, but they’re falling out of favor. Now audiobooks rule. Not only are they convenient, the movie’s characters explain, but they often are narrated by celebrities.
I like that the French value intellectualism. No American would even attempt to make a film in which characters do little else but talk, eat fabulous food, talk, drink wine, talk, and get busy in the bedroom. Imagine — they spend two hours essentially talking about ideas.
Even so, one of the characters is a digital guru for a publishing house. At a conference, she and some other self-important techie-type declare the death of libraries. They will have to be “repurposed,” moviegoers are told, which brought to my mind Henry VIII’s dissolution of the monasteries in the 16th century.
I could not help but snort loudly. As I wrote recently in this space, libraries are alive and well, thank you very much.
I would be the first to admit that it’s not all about the books nowadays, nor would I wish it to be. I just want more people to read.
Astronaut Christa McAuliffe, who perished in the 1986 explosion of the space shuttle Challenger, said, “I touch the future, I teach.” My hope for future readers is kindled every time I see elementary students huddled together over picture books, pointing and laughing, or amazed at some weird feat in the “Guinness Book of World Records.”
But the country they will venture into doesn’t nourish that curiosity, that urge to learn.
Today is the 75th anniversary of D-Day. The Allies went on to defeat the Nazis, who burned books. It’s a perfect day to celebrate our right to read — how about by reading all about it?

Texto completo: What's on TV
THE COLD BLUE 8 p.m. on HBO. World War II was still raging when "The Memphis Belle," William Wyler's documentary about the crew of an American bomber, was released in 1944. That government-produced film made for a "thorough and vivid comprehension of what a daylight bombing is actually like for the young men who wing our heavy bombers from English bases into the heart of Germany," Bosley Crowther wrote in The New York Times that year. To shoot it, cinematographers (including Wyler) flew on bombing missions; one of them, a first lieutenant named Harold J. Tannenbaum, was killed in the process. Restored footage shot for "The Memphis Belle" has been arranged by the director Erik Nelson for "The Cold Blue," a new documentary, which uses Wyler's material to give an intimate sense of what life was like in a World War II bomber. "It was more or less like being in death row in a penitentiary waiting on your turn," one veteran says in a voice-over. "And you knew it was coming."
SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (1998) 7 p.m. and 11 p.m. on AMC. Steven Spielberg's depiction of American soldiers fighting their way up Omaha Beach in one sequence helped "Saving Private Ryan" pick up Oscars for sound mixing, film editing, sound editing, cinematography and directing. The moments, near the start of the movie, leave an audience shell shocked and peppers its disorienting intensity with distinct acts of courage -- a hallmark of the movie, which is led by Tom Hanks as an Army Ranger captain. In her review for The Times, Janet Maslin noted the frankness with which Spielberg depicted conflict. "This film simply looks at war as if war had not been looked at before," she wrote.
THE LONGEST DAY (1962) 8 p.m. on TCM. Henry Fonda, John Wayne and Sean Connery are among the ensemble cast of this classic D-Day movie. (Also featured: Gert Fröbe, who would square off against Connery two years later as the villain in "Goldfinger." He plays a German officer here.) The movie reconstructed the Normandy landings with an enormous budget and striking black and white imagery; it clocks in at around three hours. After its opening in Manhattan, Bosley Crowther wrote in The Times that "it is hard to think of a picture, aimed and constructed as this one was, doing any more or any better or leaving one feeling any more exposed to the horror of war than this one does."
What's Streaming
ALWAYS BE MY MAYBE (2019) Stream on Netflix. The stand-up comic Ali Wong and the "Fresh Off the Boat" lead Randall Park cooked up this romantic comedy, which the pair also star in. Imagined as a "Boomerang" or a "When Harry Met Sally" that pulls from their own experiences and identities, the movie tells of childhood sweethearts whose relationship sizzles anew later life, in their native San Francisco.

Texto completo: After the death of two local high-powered academics in Florida last month, a pair of local congressmen have introduced a measure to address safety concerns in vehicles with keyless ignition.
The legislation, introduced by Democratic Massachusetts congressmen Joe Kennedy III of Newton and Seth Moulton of Salem, comes after the deaths of Sherry H. Penney, 81, the former interim president of the University of Massachusetts, and James Livingston, 88, a retired Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor.
The married couple were in their Sarasota, Fla., home in early May when their 2017 Toyota Avalon, which had a keyless ignition system, apparently was accidentally left running in the garage, filling the home with carbon monoxide, according to family.
The legislation, which was filed Wednesday, would require the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to require vehicles with keyless ignition technology to automatically shut off after a certain period of time.
“A vehicle left running in an attached garage can quickly fill living spaces with lethal levels of carbon monoxide," a statement from Kennedy's office said. “The New York Times has identified at least 28 deaths and 45 injuries since 2006 attributable to CO poisoning caused by vehicles with keyless ignitions inadvertently left idling."
In addition to carbon monoxide deaths, cars with keyless ignitions can unintentionally roll away as well — another feature that the legislation aims to fix.
“While current federal regulations require that vehicles with traditional keys must be in 'park' and shut down before the key is removed from the ignition, no comparable rule exists or applies to keyless ignitions," the statement said. “Despite clear evidence of a problem, NHTSA has not yet addressed the hazards associated with keyless ignitions."

18-Month Term For 75-Year-Old Behind Threats

Texto completo: A Long Island man who threatened to kill two United States senators in retaliation for their support for Brett M. Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court was sentenced Monday to 18 months in prison.
The man, Ronald DeRisi, 75, of Smithtown, N.Y., left multiple expletive-laden voice mail messages at the offices of the senators and threatened to assault and murder them. He was sentenced in Central Islip, N.Y., by Judge Joseph F. Bianco.
"Nine millimeter, side of the head," Mr. DeRisi said in one of the phone calls, according to court documents, which showed that he made the calls in October, in the days before and after Justice Kavanaugh was confirmed to serve on the Supreme Court.
The confirmation process became a contentious, partisan battle after several women accused Justice Kavanaugh of sexual assault and misconduct. He denied the allegations.
In the phone calls, Mr. DeRisi referred to Justice Kavanuagh as a "sexual predator."
A representative of Senator Chuck Grassley, a Republican of Iowa who was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee during the confirmation hearings, said Monday that the senator had been one of the officials targeted by Mr. DeRisi. His office declined to comment on the sentence.
Senator Susan Collins, a Republican from Maine whose support for Mr. Kavanaugh was pivotal to his confirmation, was the other senator threatened by Mr. DeRisi, a spokeswoman for Ms. Collins confirmed.
After executing a search warrant at Mr. DeRisi's home in October, investigators found ammunition for a 9-millimeter gun and a BB gun.
Mr. DeRisi pleaded guilty in February to threatening to assault and murder the two senators. Threatening to kill a United States official is a federal crime that carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison.
As part of his sentence, Mr. DeRisi forfeited two firearms, which were being kept by a family member, to the federal government.
Mr. DeRisi "accepted full responsibility," his lawyer, Martin Geduldig, said in an interview on Tuesday. "He knows what he did, and that he shouldn't have done it."
"He's had declining mental and physical status now for quite a few years," Mr. Geduldig said, adding that Mr. DeRisi seemed to be suffering from dementia-like symptoms as well as chronic back pain.
"Those two factors led him to say and do things that he might not say and do if he were healthier."
Peter E. Brill, a lawyer who represented Mr. DeRisi in the past, told The New York Times last year that Mr. DeRisi had also been arrested in 2011, after using a decorative sword to cut cables on a cell tower near his home. He also said that after Mr. DeRisi was arrested in 2015 and accused of threatening a lawyer for a homeowners' association with which he had a dispute, a psychological evaluation found that Mr. DeRisi had cerebral atrophy that seemed to be affecting his actions.
In a statement on Monday, United States Attorney Richard P. Donoghue said: "Our political process allows for vigorous debate, but not destruction. Threatening to harm or kill elected officials because one disagrees with their public positions goes far beyond the scope of the First Amendment and will not be tolerated."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

'Jeopardy!' leak to spur 'very appropriate' action

Texto completo: This past weekend, "Jeopardy!" executive producer Harry Friedman was looking forward to Monday, when millions of viewers would eagerly tune in to see whether phenom James Holzhauer would break champion Ken Jennings's record winnings. Holzhauer needed only about $59,000, so it seemed like a distinct possibility.
Then, Sunday afternoon, Friedman and his fellow producers received disturbing news. Somehow, someone had "pirated" the feed of the episode. A clip had leaked on the Internet that showed Holzhauer losing in dramatic fashion, falling just short of the $2.5 million that Jennings won over 74 games in 2004.
"Somebody alerted us that they had seen it on YouTube. By the time we saw it, it already had 2,000 views," Friedman said in an interview. The footage quickly spread to other social media sites.
"I feel bad for the viewers. It's not fair," he continued. "I'm not sure what's gained by doing something like that, other than some malicious intent. It doesn't really benefit anybody."
As the clip circulated, headlines about possible "Jeopardy!" spoilers started popping up on various websites and blogs Sunday - although producers would not verify whether the footage was accurate.
Late Monday morning, after the show's first broadcast aired in Montgomery, Ala., outlets including The Washington Post and New York Times published reports, with carefully crafted headlines and "spoiler" warnings, confirming that the clip was from that day's episode and that Holzhauer had lost.
While Friedman said he "can't say at this point" who posted the footage, producers have a good idea of what happened. "We think we know where and who and how," he said, adding that the show will take "very, very, very appropriate" action against those responsible.
Nonetheless, Friedman was happy to see the excited response Monday from fans who were captivated by Holzhauer's astonishing run. The professional sports gambler's hardball tactics of vacuuming up the highest-value clues and wagering huge amounts on Daily Doubles and Final Jeopardy became must-see TV.
"I think it reinforces that excellence really has no limit and that there are different ways to play the game," Friedman said. "But your strategy is only as good as your ability to come up with the correct response once you hit that signaling button."
Holzhauer typically had no problem with the buzzer or knowing the answers, but he was bested on the episode broadcast Monday by Emma Boettcher, a University of Chicago librarian who won by nearly $22,000. Friedman, who has been executive producer since 1999, described Holzhauer as a bit "shell shocked" that his "Jeopardy!" run was finally over.
Seeing him leave was an emotional experience, Friedman said, after the crew got to know him over his weeks on the show. Even host Alex Trebek got choked up at the end of the episode.
Meanwhile, given that Holzhauer's streak happened when spoilers of all kinds run rampant on social media, Friedman was grateful the results weren't leaked much earlier. After all, although contestants have to sign nondisclosure agreements, the hundreds in the studio audience are simply asked not to tell the results.
"We were pleased and surprised that nothing leaked out before this past weekend. I think that speaks for the respect that people in the studio audience have for the show," Friedman said. "That part of it was very much appreciated."

Brady finds a new group to hack off

Texto completo: In the battle of Tom vs. Tom, New York Mets fans are coming down squarely on the side of their guy.
Tom Brady landed on the wrong side of another sport’s New York fan base, angering Mets fans with his recent trademark application for a nickname that has long belonged to Tom Seaver, one of the biggest stars of the Amazin’ Mets era.
The nickname has been applied to Brady’s football feats at various and relatively obscure times over the years, but it’s unquestionably more often identified with Seaver, the Hall of Fame pitcher and winner of 198 games (out of his 311 victories) over 12 seasons with the Mets. As news spread of the May 24 filing with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, Mets fans were furious with the New England Patriots quarterback, who wasn’t born when the nickname was bestowed on the right-handed pitcher.
“Go back to deflating footballs, you jerk,” Ronaldo Sosa, a 52-year-old Mets fan, told the New York Post on Sunday at Citi Field.
Another tweeted, “Tom Terrific will always be Tom Seaver to me.”
“Go back to Boston and get your own (expletive) name, Brady,” Dom D’Angelo, 55, told the paper.
Patriots boosters blasted back on social media, with one fan tweeting: “6 Super Bowl Rings!!!!!! TOM TERRIFIC!!!!!! 1 World Series! Tom Terrific!”
Even a longtime Yankees fan took offense, calling the application “an unsavory attempt” by Brady.
“(T)his appalls me, too,” Clyde Haberman, the former New York Times columnist and editorial writer, tweeted. “That nickname has been Tom Seaver’s for decades. Brady can take a hike.”
Brady’s TEB Capital Management company filed two trademark applications last month, with both clearly indicating commercial intent. One covers collectible trading cards, sports trading cards, posters and printed photographs; the other is for T-shirts and shirts. The applications, first publicized by Philadelphia’s Gerben Law Firm, were made on a 1B or “intent-to-use” basis, which means that the company is planning a line of products bearing the nickname. Those are in addition to the numerous trademarks for his TB12 logo and health and wellness products as well as one for his TB12 Foundation.
The timing was “especially galling” to one Mets fan, “given Seaver’s health.” In March, Seaver’s family announced that the 74-year-old would be making no more public appearances because he has dementia.
“Tom will continue to work in his beloved vineyard at his California home but has chosen to completely retire from public life,” his family said in a statement at that time. “The family is deeply appreciative of those who have supported Tom throughout his career, on and off the field, and who do so now by honoring his request for privacy.”
Seaver, the 1967 National League Rookie of the Year, won the NL Cy Young Award three times and compiled a 311-205 record with a 2.86 ERA, 3,640 strikeouts and 61 shutouts from 1967-86. He pitched for the Mets from 1967 until 1977, when his desire for a new contract led to a feud with the team and he was traded to Cincinnati. He returned to the team for the 1983 season and also played for the Chicago White Sox and Boston Red Sox. He made 16 starts for the Red Sox in 1986, going 5-7 in his final season in baseball.
Long before Seaver became synonymous with Tom Terrific, that name referred to a cartoon character (along with his pooch, Mighty Manfred the Wonder Dog) on Terrytoons’ 1950s cartoon, which appeared on the Captain Kangaroo TV show. Terrytoons’ two Tom Terrific registrations have expired.

ABOUT TREY ANASTASIO
Over the last 30 years, Anastasio has made his mark in rock, classical and theatrical circles. He is a founding member of Phish, one of today’s most successful and innovative rock bands. During the summer of 2017, Phish completed a residency at the world-renowned Madison Square Garden in New York — an unprecedented 13-night run known as The Baker’s Dozen. The residency brought Phish’s total performances at the famed arena to 52.
He has received Grammy award nominations for his recordings with Phish and for his solo work. Anastasio has collaborated with artists including Dave Matthews, Herbie Hancock, Carlos Santana, Toots and the Maytals, B.B. King and The Roots.
He co-wrote the music for the Broadway musical “Hands on a Hardbody,” which received a Tony nomination for Best Original Score in 2013. In the summer of 2015, Anastasio joined the surviving four members of the Grateful Dead for five stadium shows, which celebrated the band’s 50th anniversary and served as the band’s farewell shows.
Anastasio has performed his original compositions with numerous symphonies. The New York Times hailed his Carnegie Hall performance with the New York Philharmonic as “that rarest of rarities, a classical-rock hybrid that might please partisans from both constituencies.” In 2014, he debuted a new piece for guitar and orchestra, entitled Petrichor, on a West Coast orchestral tour that concluded with a performance at the Hollywood Bowl, marking his second performance with the Los Angeles Philharmonic.

Texto completo: ST. PETERSBURG  A penthouse in the Ovation condo tower in downtown St. Petersburg has sold for $6.849 million, making it Tampa Bays second-most expensive condo ever.

The price was $51,000 less than the record sale of $6.9 million, paid in May 2016 for the penthouse directly above it in Ovation at 180 Beach Drive NE.

The 5,330-square-foot condo, sold Friday, has three balconies including one off the kitchen with an electric grill and sunset views. The formal living and dining rooms feature crystal chandeliers, crown molding and a wet bar for entertaining. The unit comes with its own three-car garage plus an assigned parking space for guests.

A deed recorded Monday shows the buyer is Amor Fati, LLC, a Florida limited liability company with a Bannockburn, Ill., mailing address. The manager is listed as Philip E. Ruben, a lawyer who has represented software companies in dealing with license agreements and other issues. Ruben, who also served as chief financial officer

of a biotech company, did not return a call for comment. (Amor Fati is Latin for love of fate or love of ones fate.)

The two Ovation penthouses are luxurious even by the standards of New York City, where luxury is defined as any residential property above $5.8 million, according to a recent New York Times story.

With 360-degree views, the penthouses are among only a few in downtown St. Petersburg that take up an entire floor.

Theyre very unique properties and they dont come on the market all that often, said Liz Heinkel, the listing agent. There are very few people that can afford this price point, so they grab them pretty quickly.

The condo went under contract just a month after it was listed March 5, a fast time for such an expensive unit. The original asking price was $7.5 million, later reduced to $6.95 million. The sellers paid $4.1 million for it eight years ago.

In the past six months, 151 condos in the downtown area have sold for $1 million or more. All but 22 of the sales were for condos in the recently completed ONE St. Petersburg, which at 41 stories is the tallest residential building on Floridas west coast.

Currently, 17 downtown condos are on the market for at least $1 million. Seven of those are in ONE St. Petersburg as original buyers try to flip them. One seller who bought a unit for $684,900 is asking $1.4 million, a 104 percent markup.

Heinkel described the downtown market as strong and consistent.

I dont like to use the term hot,  she said, because it depends on the unit. If it takes a lot of work, that takes longer to sell because were in an era where buyers want move-in ready. If a unit has been redone or tastefully done, they do sell fairly quickly. But it does slow down in summer because not as many buyers are here.

Tampa Bays condo market has a long way to go before it catches up with Manhattans  one penthouse along Billionaires Row south of Central Park sold for $238 million last year while another unit is currently available for $85 million. Included in the price: two Rolls-Royces, a Lamborghini and, if the city gets too hot and crowded, the use of a house in the Hamptons for one summer.

Teresa Smith hoped she could keep news of her impending divorce a secret, until Square Inc. blabbed about it to one of her friends.
The day after Ms. Smith, a horse trainer living outside Washington, paid the retainer for a local divorce attorney in late 2016, an acquaintance forwarded her an email full of details about the transaction. The attorney had swiped Ms. Smith's credit card through a Square device, and the payments company automatically generated the receipt that wound up in her friend's inbox.
"I might as well have put it out on Facebook or took out a front-page ad in the New York Times," Ms. Smith said.
With access to years of data on the purchase activity of hundreds of millions of unique credit and debit cards across millions of small businesses, Square has a window into spending patterns that few other tech companies can match. By supplementing that data with contact details that shoppers provide to Square for the purpose of getting digital receipts, the company is able to assemble expansive profiles of consumer behavior that it can use to run marketing and loyalty programs for its small-business customers.
But misfires happen: Square has forwarded receipts documenting transactions as mundane as a cup of coffee and as sensitive as an obstetrician's visit to people who were uninvolved in the purchases, according to emails reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. In some cases, neither the purchaser nor the recipient could say why Square sent receipts to the people it did.
At issue are the methods that tech companies employ to make money off of the financial data of their users, as well as the degree to which those companies disclose or get consent from their users about those efforts. Data on individuals' credit-card transactions can be particularly delicate and more revealing than their social-media posts or web-browsing activity. The Journal reported last year that Facebook Inc. requested detailed information from large U.S. banks about their customers as part of an effort to offer new services to users, but that data privacy emerged as a sticking point.
Ms. Smith said that when she complained to Square about her experience, she was told that her friend's email address was previously used to get a copy of a receipt from an earlier purchase made with Ms. Smith's card at a different Square vendor, a chain of events that Square confirmed to the Journal. Square's policy is to send digital receipts to the email address on file automatically unless that person opts out.
"Square said, 'We didn't do anything wrong'" Ms. Smith said. "The hell you didn't."
"While receipts received by the wrong person are incredibly rare, even one is a really bad experience," a Square spokesman said. "We've already made a number of changes to the experience, resulting in a more than 50% decrease in customer issues in one year, and we have more improvements in the works."
The Square spokesman added that digital receipts could be received by the wrong person for a variety of reasons, including consumers sharing a credit-card number, accidentally sending the receipt to a recycled phone number or seller or buyer error.
Square has been issuing digital receipts to consumers since its earliest days but started building customer-engagement and marketing services around them more recently. The company relies on consumers to input an email address or phone number that it then syncs to a particular card. It doesn't verify whether the contact information it associates with a card belongs to the cardholder, but it provides a link with each emailed receipt that lets consumers decouple a card from an email address.
At a May 2017 investor event, Square executive Jesse Dorogusker said that in the prior 12 months, Square had sent over 350 million digital receipts and used that data to help build a customer directory of 90 million emails and phone numbers.
"We know who bought what from whom, on what day, with what payment instrument," Mr. Dorogusker, who leads Square's hardware business, said at the event. "And with something as simple and fundamental as a digital receipt, we can create a valuable customer directory and a suite of tools that take advantage of it."

A business that uses Square can tap that directory to send coupons, promotional material or other messages to its shoppers for a monthly fee that starts at $15. But the company must walk a fine line between offering services that its small-business customers value and making sure those services don't alienate shoppers. Square says it doesn't sell underlying purchase data or contact details and that small businesses can't view the email addresses or phone number in the customer directories that Square compiles, unless an individual gives that contact information to the small business.
At Home on the Range, a kitchenware store in Livingston, Mont., asked Square to disable the automated digital receipts following the 2017 holiday season. Owner Jennifer Flight said she heard complaints from a number of customers whose spouses had received itemized receipts for their own Christmas gifts.
Ms. Flight said that the issue of receipts going to someone other than the purchaser generated "the most negative of all of the responses we've had from customers." She said customers didn't believe her when she explained that the receipts were likely the result of information they provided to another Square business.
"It was clear that in his mind I had dropped from the ranks of friend to salesperson, scheming to get his information to market to him," Ms. Flight said about one particularly peeved customer.
Often, a complaint about a misdirected Square receipt will involve credit cards shared by spouses. A wife may sign up for Square's digital receipt program and get notified every time her husband makes a purchase with that card at any Square business.
Lucille Conforti, a florist in Fishkill, N.Y., processes her customers' payments with Square and has gotten calls from spouses who had surprise gifts spoiled by an errant receipt.
"God forbid anyone was having an affair," she said. "You'd see everything."

Texto completo: The quote is attributed to President Harry Truman, and Ronald Reagan kept it on his desk: "It is amazing what you can accomplish if you do not care who gets the credit."
It is even more amazing what has been accomplished with the American economy, but Democratic presidential candidates, the media and economists such as Paul Krugman of The New York Times refuse to give President Trump any credit. Recall that it was Krugman, a Nobel Prize winner, who predicted that Trump's election would trigger "a global recession." One continues to wait in vain for an "I was wrong" statement from him.
The Economist, a center-left British magazine that includes coverage of events in the U.S. and is no fan of the Trump administration, recently published a remarkable editorial that contains gems Republicans should quote between now and the next election. They include a strong rebuke to the contention of many Democrats that "working people" are still struggling and that the improved economy continues to benefit only the wealthiest 1 percent.
The bleak picture painted by Democrats, the editorial says, "is at odds with reality." The Economist refers to a worldwide "jobs boom" and (note to Bernie Sanders and others promoting socialism) asserts that, "Capitalism is improving workers' lot faster than it has in years ... the zeitgeist has lost touch with the data."
Noting that U.S. unemployment at 3.6 percent is the lowest in 50 years, the magazine says, "Less appreciated is the abundance of jobs across most of the rich world."
A more educated population, the matching by websites of jobs to qualified applicants, and, yes, economic stimulus efforts that helped fuel the emergence of economies from the last recession have all contributed to the American economy and many European economies.
Then there is this, which has been the gospel of conservatives for decades when it comes to welfare and its disincentive for many to find work: "... reforms to welfare programs, both to make them less generous and to toughen eligibility tests, seem to have encouraged people to seek work."
This has forced liberal politicians to shift their focus from the unemployed to the "quality" of jobs. British Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn is quoted as saying, "Our jobs market is being turned into a sea of insecurity."
"Reality begs to differ," says The Economist. "Official projections" predict that by 2026, "America will have more at-home careers than secretaries." Jobs and the skills necessary to fill them are changing, but not so rapidly that workers -- and especially younger people -- cannot adjust their education and training to match the new requirements.
Wages are rising almost everywhere, and, as the editorial says, tight labor markets "lead firms to fish for employees in neglected pools, including among ex-convicts. ... American wonks fretted for years about how to shrink the disability-benefit rolls. Now the hot labor market is doing it for them."
This is the argument that conservatives, many Republicans and the Trump administration have been making for some time. Economic growth, not government, raises most boats.
While acknowledging "The jobs boom will not last forever" and that a recession will eventually "kill it off," the editorial concludes that the economic boom "deserves a little appreciation."
It deserves more than that and would be more than appreciated if it all happened under a Democratic president. Republicans and the Trump administration should seize on this reality and promote it every day, asking voters if they want to continue with these successful policies or return to low economic growth and fewer jobs.
It is a question Democrats and their policies of higher taxes and reimposed regulations will find difficult, if not impossible, to answer.

Los inmigrantes donan órganos pero no puede recibir trasplantes. Y es cuestión de vida o muerte

Texto completo: “Tú vas al hospital y puedes donar tus órganos aunque seas inmigrante” e indocumentado , se lamenta Abigail Martínez , pero “cuando tú eres inmigrante no te pueden dar un riñón, yo creo que es injusto ”.
Su marido, José Antonio Martínez, sufre desde hace cinco años una enfermedad renal, según informa la emisora NY1, y el tratamiento de diálisis al que lleva sometiéndose desde entonces ya no es suficiente .
“Su riñón ya se hizo muy pequeño, ya no le sirven los riñones”, explica su esposa, “no tenemos el dinero, no tenemos los fondos para que a él lo operen”.
Martínez necesita un trasplante de riñones para sobrevivir. Y no es el único. Según un estudio publicado en febrero de 2018, alrededor de 6,500 inmigrantes indocumentados en todo el país sufren una enfermedad renal grave, pero en la mayoría de estados sólo pueden ser tratado con diálisis en caso de emergencia.
Y casi nunca pueden recibir un trasplante de riñón (se han registrado casos en California), que es una opción más saludable para el paciente y menos costosa para el erario público que la diálisis. Además, añade el estudio, los inmigrantes indocumentados donan sus órganos en mayor cantidad de la que reclaman un trasplante.
No existe una regulación legal que impida a estos inmigrantes recibir trasplantes; el problema es que, sin seguro médico disponible, el precio es casi siempre inasumible. Y el seguro médico público sólo cubre la diálisis ordinaria (no de emergencia) en estados como Nueva York, California , Illinois y Washington DC (en el resto, sólo se puede realizar en situaciones de emergencia, pese a ser un tratamiento que se precisa periódicamente), pero casi nunca cubre el trasplante.
En 2015, por ejemplo, una clínica de Nueva York se negó a trasplantarle a una mujer con una enfermedad renal en fase terminal el riñón que le iba a donar su propio marido, al enterarse de que ambos eran indocumentados y, por tanto, el seguro público Medicare no cubriría la intervención.
Según informó entonces el diario Daily News, un trasplante costaba 106,000 dólares , mientras que la diálisis (dos veces a la semana de forma indefinida) cuesta 72,000 dólares al año (para toda la vida).
Es por ello que, pese a pagar sus impuestos en Estados Unidos, algunos afectados viajan a México a realizar el trasplante, aunque allí el precio sigue siendo muy alto (40,000 dólares en 2011, según el diario The New York Times) y requieren de préstamos.
El congresista estatal Félix Ortiz ha presentado en mayo una propuesta de ley para que el seguro médico público Medicaid cubra los trasplantes a aquellos pacientes que lleven al menos dos años bajo diálisis. Según ha relatado a NY1, hay al menos seis inmigrantes indocumentados que lo requieren. La misma propuesta ha sido planteada ante el Senado estatal por el congresista Gustavo Rivera.

His American life: An undocumented journalist gets a school named after him

Texto completo: MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. - On what was once a grassy field surrounded by tall pines, workers here are assembling a shiny new public elementary school, obscured temporarily by large construction tarps.
This is a forward-looking Silicon Valley community. Google, Symantec and Intuit have headquarters here. So perhaps it is not surprising that the school will be named after Jose Antonio Vargas, 38, a former Washington Post colleague who grew up near here and is, at the moment, an undocumented immigrant.
I could find no studies of the age of people when their names were affixed to schools. Vargas is the youngest I have encountered who was alive to enjoy the honor. Revolutionary War hero Nathan Hale died at age 21, long before any schools were named for him.
Notice that I didn't call Vargas an American. He feels he is one. So do many people who know him, including me. The federal government doesn't agree. That dispute, plus his talents as a writer, filmmaker and activist, have made him a celebrity among the nation's 11 million immigrants without legal status.
It is stunning that a school district would name a school for him when the national trend is to remove controversial monikers from educational institutions, not add them. Glorifying Vargas also seems to contradict President Trump's harsh statements about immigrants.
Tamara Wilson, a research scientist and member of the Mountain View Whisman School District board, suggested the move. She told the board that Vargas "was taught in our schools and has gone on to accomplish extraordinary things. He represents the many faces of our students, their struggles and their accomplishments and represents a path to achievement." The school's student body will be about 40 percent white, 32 percent Asian, 16 percent Hispanic, 2 percent black, 4 percent Filipino (Vargas's ethnicity) and 6 percent unknown.
Naming the school after Vargas, Wilson said, would send "a strong message to any parent or child in our district who is afraid, who wonders what the future holds, who questions their opportunities to succeed." The vote was 4 to 0 in favor, with one abstention. Wilson has since become the board's president.
Vargas travels often throughout the country despite advice from many lawyer friends that he stay in California. The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency "can detain me at any point," he said.
His mother, who remains in the Philippines, paid someone to get him on a flight to California when he was 12 so that he could live with his grandparents. He did not know he was undocumented until, eager to drive at age 16, he applied for a driver's license. The clerk inspected his green card carefully, leaned over and whispered: "This is fake. Don't come back here again."
He buried his fears under hard work. At Mountain View High School, writing became what he calls "a way of belonging" at both the school paper and a community paper. He ignored his grandfather's worries about Vargas's name appearing in print. He also sang, debated, acted, directed and was elected to represent the school's interests at the school board. His senior year, he came out as gay. He formed a deep and lasting friendship with Principal Pat Hyland when she approached him one night and asked, "Don't you ever go home?"
Such friends helped him pay tuition at San Francisco State University and get an Oregon driver's license, which did not require a green card or a passport. When he reached The Post in 2004, he seemed to me a whirlwind, going deep into the complexities of his generation. By connecting social media to the aftermath of the 2007 massacre at Virginia Tech, he was recognized as part of The Post team that won the Pulitzer Prize.
In 2011, he outed himself as an undocumented immigrant in the New York Times Magazine. That same year, he co-founded Define American, a nonprofit project to facilitate dialogue about immigration.
He remains in peril because he is four months too old to qualify for Dream Act protections offered to people brought in illegally as children. It was national news in 2014 when he was detained at the McAllen, Tex., airport. Influential friends persuaded the Obama administration to let him go. As he explained in his 2018 memoir, "Dear America: Notes of an Undocumented Citizen," it helped that he wasn't Mexican.
Naming a school after him, he said, still seems "surreal." He doesn't know what he will say at the Aug. 15 opening before a crowd of family and friends. I expect he will come up with something educational about the many surprises of his American life.

Texto completo: Ella is a British woman who grew up in a broken home and was abused by her stepdad. Her eldest son got thrown out of school and ended up sitting around the house drinking. By the time her daughter was 16, she was pregnant and had an eating disorder. Ella, though in her mid-30s, had never had a real job. Life was a series of endless crises - temper tantrums, broken washing machines, her son banging his head against the walls.
Every time the family came into contact with the authorities, another caseworker was brought in to provide a sliver of help. An astonishing 73 professionals spread across 20 different agencies and departments got involved with this family. Nobody had ever sat down with them to devise a comprehensive way forward.
In her mind-shifting book, "Radical Help," British social entrepreneur Hilary Cottam tracks how one of the social workers in Ella's case spent his days. Roughly 74% of his time was spent on administrative matters - recording data, making referrals to other agencies and meeting with other agencies. Only 14% of the social worker's time was actually spent with the family he was meant to be serving. And that face-to-face time was mostly with a clipboard, checking off boxes on the forms that went back to central administration.
The administrative system around Ella and her family costs roughly 250,000 pounds ($317,000) per year.
Cottam asked the government workers involved in Ella's case if they could recall a time when they'd transformed a family so it no longer needed government help. They couldn't think of one.
I met Cottam in London recently and she made the point that welfare systems are often designed to manage needs, but they are not designed to build capabilities so that families can stand on their own.
Moreover, most Western systems were not designed to confront the kind of poverty prevalent today. When these systems were put in place in the 1950s and '60s, unemployment was more often a temporary thing that happened between the time you got laid off from a big employer and the time you got hired by a new one. Now, economic insecurity is often a permanent state, as people patch together different jobs to make ends meet. Health issues for people in the welfare system are often chronic - obesity, diabetes, many forms of mental illness.
Our legacy welfare structures are ill suited to today's poverty.
Cottam has spent the past decade or so helping local authorities across Britain build new welfare programs. Her programs start by shifting power to the former "recipients" of services. The programs ask, "What sort of trajectory would you like to be on?" Then the programs build social networks around the families to help them achieve their goals.
For example, Ella was asked if she would like to lead a "life team" that would help her family turn around. She agreed. She was given the power to select the eight people from across agencies who would constitute the team. She chose people from social work, the housing authority and the police force.
Members of the team spent 80% of their time with the family and only 20% on administration. Ella and the team worked together to stabilize her most immediate issue - negotiating away eviction notices. Then the team worked to improve interfamily dynamics so there wasn't so much violence and screaming.
After a family is stable, the team and family work on building skills and telling stories of success. By 18 months, many of the families involved in the Life Team program no longer need the team. Ella got her first office job and assumed more responsibility for her family. Her kids were back in mainstream schooling.
In the old welfare model, social workers are detached professionals and overwhelmed, bound by bureaucratic rules and often slipping into emotional permafrost. At Life Team, it's about relational accompaniment, giving social workers the discretion to do what they think is best.
Cottam has designed other programs with a similar collaborative ethos. Backr is a program that takes people who are detached from the labor force and helps them join extended social networks where they can connect one another to job openings and develop skills. Circles is a program for the elderly. It brings together lonely seniors into small groups that are part social club, part concierge service and part self-help cooperative. Wellogram is a similar social structure for the chronically ill.
Basically, Cottam's programs create villages within the welfare state. Her systems are not designed around individual clients, but around relational networks. People tend to have better outcomes when they are held accountable by a network of peers. Three-quarters of the smokers in Wellogram successfully quit, 44% lowered their blood pressure, 64% started work or went back to school.
The old legacy welfare programs were designed for people enmeshed in thick communities but who had suffered a temporary setback. Today many people lack precisely that web of thick relationship. The welfare state of the future has to build the social structures that people need to thrive. This is one way government can build community.

LGBT icons Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera to be commemorated with NYC monument

Texto completo: Early LGBT rights activists Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera will be commemorated with a monument in New York's Greenwich Village, near the epicenter of the historic Stonewall riots.
The monument was publicly announced Thursday in honor of the 50th anniversary of Stonewall and just in time for Pride month.
“We hope this monument is a lasting tribute to two women who devoted themselves to life-saving change for people throughout their community," said Gillian Branstetter of the National Center for Transgender Equality to USA TODAY in an e-mail.
"Transgender history is American history, and lasting recognition of the work done by those who came before us is a crucial step towards honoring the past and reaching the future Marsha and Sylvia worked to build. ”
Johnson and Rivera were key figures in the Stonewall riots of 1969, in which gay patrons fought against a police raid. At the time, New York refused to grant licenses to bars that served gay people. It resulted in police entering Stonewall Inn with a warrant on June 28, 1969, where they arrested 13 people.
“The majority of people at Stonewall were either drag queens or gay men of color,” Titus Montalvo, a hairdresser and makeup artist who was 16 at the time, told USA TODAY.
Johnson and Rivera went on to co-found STAR – Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries – an organization that served young, homeless trans youth. The term "transgender" was not used commonly in their lifetime. Johnson later became involved with the AIDS charity ACT UP in the 1980s.
The monument, which is estimated to cost $750,000 according to the New York Times, will honor the two trans pioneers posthumously. Johnson died at 46 in 1992, in what was ruled twenty years later as a possible homicide, while Rivera died in 2002 at 50 from liver cancer complications.

Texto completo: Jacques Marchais, an art dealer and collector, never traveled to Asia, but the artifacts she gathered from Tibet, as well as from Nepal, Mongolia and northern China, became the passion of her life. Her dream to display this collection to the public was realized in 1947 when, just a few months before her death, the Jacques Marchais Museum of Tibetan Art opened atop a hill on Staten Island, next door to her house.
The museum was designed to resemble a Himalayan monastery, and she and a local Italian mason, Joseph Primiano, worked to find the stones needed to recreate its traditional mountain feel.
In 1976, The New York Times compared the museum, with its pagoda-shaped roofs, small meditation rooms, library, exquisite garden and heralded collection, to "Shangri-La on Staten Island." The Dalai Lama visited in 1991.
But despite its rich history and holdings, the museum today is showing its age and the burdens of being a small institution with limited funds and little staff.
While its remarkable objects -- a Sino-Tibetan shrine, gilded Buddha figures, a carved and lacquered red cinnabar stupa -- still shine, the roof badly needs repair, staff desks occupy display space and a glance at the skylight reveals peeling paint. The environmental conditions have forced some of the collection into storage.
Many visitors remain charmed by the tranquillity of the artifacts and their setting, but some have complained on social media about a sense of clutter and disrepair.
Meg Ventrudo, the executive director, said that, actually, the museum has already turned the corner toward a brighter future. The museum has received just over $ 1.9 million in capital funding from the Department of Cultural Affairs and local officials, for a major renovation that will include a new roof, an upgraded HVAC system and replacement windows and doors as well as other improvements.
At the museum, a board advertising the plan reads: "Don't look now ... but big changes are coming!"
When the renovations are completed, at a date yet to be determined, it will be possible to display much more of the collection, particularly textiles and wooden objects, Ms. Ventrudo said.
"I think we've come very far in the time that I've been here," she said, "and I think that is very positive. I think I'd say that we are financially O.K., but we are underfunded as far as a lot of the projects that we want to do."
Thanks to grants, programming has increased and improvements have already been made in storage and collection maintenance.
"We've had new display cases made for our objects," said Ms. Ventrudo, who has run the museum for 15 years. "And we've had the restoration of a shrine that had been in storage for 30 years, and now it's on display, so every project takes time and money."
Small museums across the country struggle to raise money and capture attention at a time when so many diversions, cultural offerings and entertainments, online and off, compete for the attention of potential visitors.
Even larger, regional museums can face difficulties. The Pasadena Museum of California Art shut its doors in 2018, even as a larger institution in the area, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, planned a massive expansion. That same year, the Berkshire Museum in Massachusetts sold off 22 artworks to raise money to close its budget gap and finance renovations and programming as it adjusts its mission to focus more on science and history.
"What I hear most from small museum professionals is about the challenge of capacity," said Allison Titman, president of the Small Museum Association, a peer network. "There is always work to do and it can be a challenge to allocate resources and find the staff to do it. They are trying to do a lot with a little."
The American Alliance of Museums notes in its resources for small museums that 78 percent of its members have fewer than 10 staff members, and that, "by any measure, the vast majority of the nation's museums are small."
The Jacques Marchais Museum has two full-time and three part-time employees, along with some volunteers and various contractors.
"We're always cleaning stuff, we're always fixing things here," Ms. Ventrudo said. "It's just a matter of kind of keeping up with everything."
The museum's annual operating budget -- $ 230,000 this year -- is funded by a grant from the city as well as contributions from donors and foundations, and admission and other revenue.
She said there are no plans to sell any of the Tibetan museum's 5,000-item collection to raise money. Some 60 to 70 percent of the items are in storage.
"It's a combination of not having enough space here, and climate, and what we've chosen to show curatorially," Ms. Ventrudo said. The museum puts on rotating thematic exhibitions and at times lends items to the Rubin Museum of Art in Manhattan and other institutions.
The space constraints are evident in the Marchais museum's library room, which contains artifacts and books on Tibetan art, Buddhism and philosophy, but also serves as the museum's main office. Ms. Ventrudo and another staff member run the museum from two desks there that are outfitted with computers, phones and a printer.
Ms. Ventrudo hopes to expand at some point so that the administrative work can be conducted in a separate building.
She said that while the museum has a loyal local donor base, which includes support from local legislators and foundations on Staten Island, she has found it tough to raise money across the water in Manhattan. "I've gone to cocktail parties in the city and people have said to me, 'Why would anyone want to go to Staten Island?"' she said.
Certainly, there are days when only a handful of visitors trickle through the museum's doors. But Ms. Ventrudo said attendance has grown to 5,000 visitors a year, a number boosted by increased public programming and participation in the Culture Pass program, an initiative through New York City's libraries that offers free visits to multiple venues.
Of course, she said, there will always be another project that requires time and money, and it's tough to complete labor-intensive grant applications when competing institutions have many more employees to fill them out. But, despite the challenges, she said, the museum must function at the same level as other museums, regardless of its size.
"I think what the big challenge is, is just because you're a small museum, doesn't mean that you don't have to meet museum standards," Ms. Ventrudo said.

Texto completo: What's Streaming
ASK DR. RUTH (2019) Stream on Hulu. When everyone else treated sex and female sexuality as a dirty secret, Dr. Ruth Westheimer was bringing it center stage. In the 1980s, the sex therapist was everywhere -- on late-night TV, on the radio and on morning talk shows. This documentary, directed by Ryan White, follows Dr. Ruth continuing her career even as she approaches her 90th birthday. The film also delves into her past as a Holocaust survivor and explores how she paved the way for a sexual revolution. In her New York Times review, Jeannette Catsoulis wrote that the documentary "feels more like an encomium than a thoughtful probe of a brilliantly mutinous mind."
THE MAN WHO FELL TO EARTH (1976) Stream on The Criterion Channel. In this film based on the book by Walter Tevis, David Bowie plays Thomas Jerome Newton, an alien who goes to Earth on a quest to find water to save his planet. With assistance from a lawyer played by Buck Henry, Newton invents a way to transport water home. But his efforts are interrupted when he falls in love with a hotel clerk played by Candy Clark and when the United States government comes asking questions.
OH, RAMONA! (2019) Stream on Netflix. Another coming-of-age rom-com is arriving on Netflix. The film, directed by Cristina Jacob, follows Andrei, an awkward 16-year-old who is infatuated with his classmate Ramona. But things get complicated when he meets Anemona, a beautiful hotel clerk, while on a family vacation.
What's on TV
BAD TIMES AT THE EL ROYALE (2018) 8 p.m. on HBO; stream on HBO platforms. Given the film's ominous title, it shouldn't be a surprise that the characters don't have an easy go of it at the El Royale, a rundown hotel on the border of Nevada and California. The film is stacked with stars, including Jeff Bridges, Jon Hamm, Dakota Johnson, Cynthia Erivo and Chris Hemsworth, and follows seven strangers -- most of whom have a secret -- over the course of one stormy night. Written and directed by Drew Goddard, also known for "The Martian," the film received mixed reaction. In her review for The Times, Manohla Dargis wrote, "Goddard keeps everything smoothly, ebbing and flowing as the characters separate and join together, but at some point during this logy 2-hour-and-21-minute exercise you want something more substantial than even Hemsworth's admittedly mesmerizing snaky hips."
STANLEY CUP FINALS: GAME 3 8 p.m. on NBCSN. The St. Louis Blues go to Boston to face off the Bruins in the third game of the series. This is the first time the Blues have made it to the final round since 1970, when the team went three straight years in the Stanley Cup Finals. The Bruins last won the Stanley Cup in 2011, defeating the Vancouver Canucks.

For those unfamiliar with the business of Mount Everest, last week's photo showing hundreds of climbers in a dense line snaking up the mountain's southeast ridge on their way to the 29,029-foot summit was a shock. An American named Don Cash died in that traffic jam after being on his feet for more than 12 hours.
Another American who made it to the summit and came down safely later told the New York Times, "It was like a zoo." The Times blamed "fly-by-night adventure companies . . . taking up untrained climbers," the Nepalese government, "hungry for every climbing dollar it can get," and "a growing body of thrill-seekers the world over" for the situation.
To many observers, this wasn't just confirmation of the worst aspects of Everest's reputation; it was a sign that today's Everest climbers represent the height of human stupidity. But the situation on the summit this year is not reason enough to demonize those who were up there or who will go up there in the future.
I've been writing about the world's highest peak as long as I've been a journalist, and I was on the scene at Base Camp, living with the Everest ER doctors, when, in April 2015, a massive earthquake triggered an avalanche that killed more than a dozen climbers - and almost killed me. Yet if someone offered me the chance to go climb Everest in the next few years, I would probably say yes.
That wouldn't mean just paying $70,000 for a one-time adventure. Before climbing Everest, I'd have to take mountaineering courses here in the United States, an expedition to another 8,000- meter peak such as Cho Oyu and months off from full-time work. What's lost in today's conversation about Everest is how much time and effort the majority of climbers dedicate to preparing for their summit attempts.
Everest has had periodic PR crises since 12 people died during the spring of 1996 and Jon Krakauer condemned the commercial guiding industry's foibles in his book "Into Thin Air." Every few years, the cycle repeats itself: Faraway onlookers shake their heads, reporters write about how climbing conditions are worse than ever, and Nepal's government officials, who control access to the mountain's most popular route, make vague statements about imposing new rules.
I came away from my time at Base Camp feeling conflicted: So much obviously unnecessary death has occurred around this place, but, if I had the means, I would go back as soon as I could. For all the bad it brings out in people, Everest will always be an invigorating, awe- inspiring wonder. To see it with your own eyes is a gift; to meet the people of Nepal's Khumbu Valley is to be humbled and befriended in ways you never imagined.
I'm a distance runner, and I believe that, just like climbing Everest, pretty much anyone can run a marathon these days. That doesn't mean running a marathon is easy or perfectly safe. Several people die running in the United States each year, although there's no doubt that climbing Everest is riskier than running 26.2 miles. But both pursuits are fairly irrational, require sacrifices and are not easily understood by those who say, "I would never do such a thing."
Fortunately, if you can't finish a marathon, you're probably not going to hurt anyone else in the process. Ill-prepared Everest climbers compromise the safety of other people on the mountain. That's a real problem that "the beauty and awe of Everest" can't excuse. But it's possible to hold all these thoughts at the same time: Just because a massive feat of physical endurance is achievable doesn't mean it's easy. And just because some people will attempt this feat without proper training doesn't make everyone who does it an idiot. And it doesn't make the pursuit itself stupid.
The Nepali government and certain guiding companies absolutely can do more to keep inexperienced climbers off Everest. The problem is not that too many people want to climb. It's that a few guiding companies are willing to accept clients who aren't ready to do it - and catering to their needs on the mountain is often what leads to deadly traffic jams.
There's a lot to roll your eyes at about the modern Everest experience: the insanely luxurious accommodations some expeditions provide at Base Camp, the high sticker prices, the human waste. The endless superlatives climbers use to distinguish themselves and get funding for their trips: the youngest person, the oldest person, the first person with cystic fibrosis. (I could be the "first woman with Type 1 diabetes.") So much of that deserves healthy cynicism. But the desire to test your own limits by walking to the top of the world on your own two feet remains pretty darn pure.
