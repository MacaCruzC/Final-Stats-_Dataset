Texto completo: It’s easy to find an obvious motive for President Trump’s well-documented and much-ballyhooed “war” on California. After all, this state in 2016 gave Hillary Clinton a margin of more than 3 million votes over Trump and he’s felt hurt and angry over it ever since.
He’s taken action after action against this state’s best interests, one example his September attempt to eliminate California’s unique authority the early-1970s Clean Air Act to regulate its own air quality. Even though Trump and his handpicked chief of the federal Environmental Protection Agency moved the other day to revoke that ability, most legal authorities say he can’t actually do it because California’s right to fix its air was granted by Congress, not the President of that time, Republican Richard Nixon.
Presidents have a lot of executive authority, those legal experts say, but they cannot unilaterally reverse acts of Congress.
Showing its whimsical nature, Trump’s administration shortly after announced it would withhold highway funds from dozens of California areas because they don’t meet federal clean air standards – even though some of the affected areas do in fact meet those standards. So Trump wants to penalize California for having dirty air at the same time he seeks to take away its ability to clean up that same air. Go figure, or as Democratic U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein deadpanned, the combined moves “seem counterintuitive.”
Trump also threatens to withhold federal grants from police in California’s many “sanctuary cities.” He warned he would cut federal wildfire aid and penalize San Francisco because its homeless population allegedly dumps human waste and hypodermic needles into the Pacific Ocean and San Francisco Bay. Except they don’t do that.
Time after time, Trump trumpets actions against California, with the state’s attorney general, Xavier Becerra, reacting with lawsuits like a Pavlovian laboratory dog.
But does Trump really mean all this seriously, when he’s had so little success at it? Or is another agenda at work here?
This question arises because the pre-presidency Trump was in effect a carnival barker, always aware of the legendary circus impresario P.T. Barnum’s observation that “There’s a sucker born every minute.” Trump the showman understood while running his reality television show that, as a New York Times television critic observed, “the only rule is that there are no rules.”
He carried this sense over into his presidency, where a day rarely goes by without some crisis, be it a threat to bomb Iran or one to punish California. Trump also knows that California-bashing is a longtime, popular national pastime everywhere outside the Golden State.
So when Trump blasts America’s longtime allies and cozies up to the most murderous of foreign dictators, it may all be for show, with the sense that as long as he keeps America entertained, he can get on with his real interest, which is making profits.
It’s an approach completely unlike any previous President, and one whose ultimate consequences are unknown as an impeachment inquiry gets started. But it is fairly clear that Trump stands little chance of making good on most of the attacks he’s made against California.
Top state officials say they are fairly certain of that, despite a Supreme Court that’s upheld some other unprecedented Trump actions, like his condoning the caging of small immigrant and refugee children.
Said Gov. Gavin Newsom, who seems to enjoy sparring with Trump, and so is part of the President’s new show, “If Trump prevails, we will have more asthma in California…and other diseases. But that’s the state of things today in this country…We will fight back when he goes after our Dreamers and our health standards. And we will win in the courts.”
Added Becerra, “If the arguments in the President’s tweets are the arguments they will use to propel (legal actions), then we’re looking pretty good and we will enjoy facing them in court.”
The trick here is to see Trump’s real apparent motive: Less to hurt California or the potential victims of his actions than to keep the spotlight constantly on himself, impeachment investigation or not, and thereby help ensure another presidential term and even more personal profits while he steers government and foreign spending to his many properties.

500 fans pack Torrance bookstore to meet Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and learn about his third Sherlock Holmes-steeped book

Texto completo: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s record of 38,387 career NBA points has stood for 20 years. According to his manager, Deborah Morales, Abdul-Jabbar — author of 16 books, only six about basketball — has written more words than he scored points during his 21-year Hall of Fame career.
Abdul-Jabbar’s latest, “Mycroft and Sherlock: The Empty Birdcage,” was released last week, his third about mystery icon Sherlock Holmes’ older, smarter brother. In response, more than 500 people crowded into the Barnes and Noble Bookstore in Torrance’s Del Amo Fashion Center for a chance to meet Abdul-Jabbar and snag a signed copy.
“I always enjoyed Sherlock Holmes from the time I was a kid,” said the former UCLA Bruin and L.A. Laker. “I used to always watch the Sherlock Holmes Theater on television on Saturdays. When I was in the 10th grade we read the “Red-Headed League” and was shocked to find out that he was not a real person.”
Like many fans of the legendary and, yes, fictional detective, Abdul-Jabbar found himself fascinated with Mycroft, a minor character in Arthur Conan-Doyle’s books who intermittently had a major impact on the crime-solver’s life.
“I was surprised that there were that many people like I was that were curious as I was to who Mycroft was,” Abdul-Jabbar said.
Abdul-Jabbar’s first book in the Mycroft Holmes series was published in 2015; a second followed in 2016. Both made the New York Times best-seller list.
“The fact that people wanted to know about about the third installment is wonderful,” he said. “I didn’t expect this. It’s pretty neat.”
After a short talk about the book in Torrance, Abdul-Jabbar signed more than 500 copies of his books, posed for photos and chatted with fans for about two hours. Some quizzed the author about Sherlock, the art of writing and the joy of mysteries — and, not surprisingly, some came to talk basketball.
“It was kind of neat to meet Kareem and to be able to hear what he had to say,” said Robert Young of Westchester. “It is unique because it is an unexplored niche in the Sherlock Holmes series. I look forward to reading it.”
“I think it is pretty awesome that Kareem is writing these type of books and he also writes many children’s books,” said reader Valerie Cooper. “I think is so important for kids to see a star-athlete who is also an accomplished writer.”
“I love reading and I love the Lakers and basketball. Kareem is one of my idols,” said Aidan Toscano, a 16-year old Redondo High student-athlete. “I thought it was a great opportunity to meet him and get his book.”

Greed alone drives President Trump

Texto completo: There’s a common thread that stretches forward from Donald Trump’s financial scandals of the 1980s to his damning phone call with the president of Ukraine.
It’s the self-dealing.
Wherever he was, whatever his title, the president has used the powers at his disposal to enrich or otherwise benefit himself, regardless of what law, fiduciary duty or oath of office bound him to do.
Trump ran his campaign in 2016 on a single premise: greed. (OK, two premises: greed and racism.) He boasted to his fans about his (inflated) wealth and gilded lifestyle, both products of clever deployments of his avarice. It was a trait he promised, paradoxically, that he’d apply more altruistically once elected.
“My whole life I’ve been greedy, greedy, greedy,” he said at a January 2016 rally. “I’ve grabbed all the money I could get. I’m so greedy. But now I want to be greedy for the United States. I want to grab all that money. I’m going to be greedy for the United States.”
His track record suggested that would be unlikely, perhaps impossible — in part because his life has always been about blurring lines between personal gain and professional or legal responsibilities.
This was the case when the Trump family set up a shell company called All County Building Supply & Maintenance in the early 1990s, to pretend to purchase boilers, cleaning supplies and other building equipment from (real) vendors. This middleman, which existed only on paper, then “resold” everything at an inflated price to the Trump Organization. The purpose of the shell company was to allow Trump’s father, Fred, to transfer huge cash gifts to his children as though they were ordinary business transactions. This helped the Trump family evade a 55% estate tax, as The New York Times reported last year.
It was also the case from the 1980s through the past presidential campaign, as Trump siphoned funds from his charity for his personal benefit. He used Trump Foundation money to settle legal disputes involving his for-profit companies, to renovate a fountain outside one of his hotels and to buy enormous portraits of himself, as my Washington Post colleague David A. Fahrenthold documented.
It was likewise the case when his once-publicly-traded company, Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts, inflated financial results in a way that the Securities and Exchange Commission said served to mislead investors. And also when his private company allegedly provided false sales figures for real estate developments in Mexico, Panama, Toronto and New York.
And so on.
Such cases repeatedly showed that Trump had no problem draining money from bondholders, investors or tax coffers if he thought he could get away with it. They also illustrated exactly how he might govern as president: in his own interest.
Trump’s supporters shrugged off his refusal to divest from his business interests, arguing that it didn’t matter if he continued to make money while president so long as he still did right by the country. But we knew at some point he’d have to decide between a policy that benefited the country and one that benefited himself.
And we knew which choice he’d make.
So it was no surprise that his administration abruptly canceled the planned relocation of the FBI headquarters, which might have allowed the existing site to be redeveloped into a hotel that would compete with the nearby Trump International Hotel.
Or that foreign leaders and business executives have patronized this and other Trump properties around the world, in a transparent attempt to influence U.S. policy on aid, arms deals and merger approvals. In fact, during their now-infamous July 25 call, the Ukrainian president made sure to note a recent stay at a Trump property in New York.
It’s likewise shocking, but not altogether surprising, that military personnel have had unnecessary layovers at Trump’s Scottish resort.
This is exactly the kind of stuff that worried those who wrung their hands about his shady, self-dealing, private-sector past.
Moreover, given Trump’s rampant small-time grifting in public, it seemed impossible to imagine he wouldn’t go after bigger fish in private — including, say, extorting a foreign power into smearing a political rival.
Trump maintains that his call with the Ukrainian president was “perfect.” And, hey, maybe he genuinely believes this. Indeed, the best defense you can give for Trump’s actions is that after all these years he has become incapable of telling the difference between his own interests and anyone else’s — and by extension, what it means to be “greedy” for himself vs. “greedy” for the United States.
Perhaps for Trump, as for France’s Louis XIV, “l’état, c’est moi.”

Texto completo: It's been six days since Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. , announced an official impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump over a whistleblower complaint related to Trump asking Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden.
After the impeachment probe was announced last week, the White House released a summary of the phone call between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, and the whistleblower's complaint was declassified and made public.
Phone call: What Trump and Zelensky said on July 25
Complaint: Key takeaways from the now-released whistleblower complaint
Timeline: The events that led up to Trump's fateful phone call
Additional details around the inquiry and related storylines seem to develop each day; here's what you missed over the weekend:
The whistleblower will speak to Congress
Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. , who is the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said that the still anonymous whistleblower has reached an agreement to testify before Congress "very soon. "
A key concern for Congress will be to ensure the whistleblower's identity can remain secret, Schiff said. No date or time has set for an appearance yet.
More: Whistleblower reaches agreement to testify, will appear 'very soon,' Rep. Adam Schiff says
The whistleblower's complaint said not only that Trump had "used the powers of his office" to ask Zelensky to investigate a leading contender for the 2020 presidential election, but that the White House had taken steps to conceal records of the call.
Whistleblower's attorneys concerned about safety, anonymity
As the impeachment inquiry moves forward, one of the whistleblower's attorneys has sent a letter to acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire expressing concern about the safety of the whistleblower.
"The events of the past week have heightened our concerns that our client’s identity will be disclosed publicly and that, as a result, our client will be put in harm’s way," Andrew Bakaj wrote.
More: Whistleblower attorney expresses 'serious concerns' over client safety to acting DNI
Though not cited in the letter, The New York Times has also come under fire for publishing details that the lawyers argue may compromise the whistleblower's identity.
Another of the whistleblower's lawyers, Mark Zaid, tweeted that the decision to publish that information could lead to the identification of either the whistleblower or another person by mistake.
"This will place individual in much more dangerous situation, not only in their professional world but also their possible personal safety," Zaid said.
Trump tweets: 'Big Consequences!'
Trump spent the weekend and early Monday talking about the whistleblower, the whistleblower's White House sources and Schiff on Twitter.
Referencing a moment during last week's impeachment hearing in which Schiff exaggerated lines from Trump's phone call with Zelensky, Trump questioned whether Schiff to be arrested for treason.
More: 'Treason,' 'spying,' 'civil war': Donald Trump lashes out at impeachment accusers
Focusing on White House officials the whistleblower cited in the complaint, Trump said, "Was this person SPYING on the U. S. President? Big Consequences!"
. . . . In addition, I want to meet not only my accuser, who presented SECOND & THIRD HAND INFORMATION, but also the person who illegally gave this information, which was largely incorrect, to the “Whistleblower. ” Was this person SPYING on the U. S. President? Big Consequences!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 29, 2019
House Democrats subpoena Pompeo's records
On Friday, House Democrats subpoenaed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for documents related to Ukraine and Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.
Democrats want to know more about the State Department's role in arranging conversations between Ukraine and Giuliani, though Pompeo was not specifically mentioned in the whistleblower complaint.
Giuliani has said he only contacted Ukrainian officials at the urging of the State Department.
“To the best of my knowledge, so from what I’ve seen so far, each of the actions that were undertaken by State Department officials was entirely appropriate and consistent with the objective that we’ve had certainly since this new government has come into office," Pompeo said on Thursday.
More: Mike Pompeo under growing scrutiny for State Department's role in Ukraine scandal
Ukrainian prosecutor: Bidens didn't violate laws
At the center of this saga is the allegation by Trump that when Biden was vice president, he pressured Ukraine to dismiss their prosecutor general, who was investigating an energy company where his son sat on the board of directors.
There is no evidence to support that allegation. The United States' position during the Obama administration was that the prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, was not doing enough to target corruption.
The Ukrainian prosecutor who closed the investigation against the gas company, Yuriy Lutsenko, said Friday that he was not aware of "any possible violation of Ukrainian law by [Joe] Biden and by [his son, Hunter Biden]. ”
Reuters also reported Friday that an investigation into the company focused on years before Hunter Biden was on to the board.

Where does Congress go from here?
Congress is taking a two-week recess, but leaders have scheduled private depositions during that time with key players in the Ukraine matter and will likely issue more subpoenas.
Michael Atkinson, the inspector general for the intelligence community who judged the whistleblower complaint to be credible upon receiving it, is scheduled for a closed-door hearing on Friday.
So far, five State Department officials have scheduled depositions over the next two weeks.
Pelosi says she wants to move "expeditiously" on the inquiry.

Texto completo: Delawareans love novels, especially those filled with mystery and intrigue.
The most popular book in the last six months was mystery novel "Where the Crawdads Sing" by Delia Owens, according to data from the Delaware Division of Libraries.
Published in 2018, the book follows two timelines that converge. One is a young girl named Kya who grew up in the marsh of North Carolina, and the other a murder investigation of local celebrity Chase Andrews.
Not only is "Crawdads" the most checked-out book at 2,169 checkouts but also the top of waitlists, with 1,111 Delawareans waiting to get their hands on the New York Times best-selling book.
Brandywine Hundred Library manager Jean Kaufman says the book was checked out 206 times in the last six months at their library, with 201 people in line for a copy.
Route 9 Library manager Alix Jefferson said that he's noticed that most of his patrons also love popular books. "Where the Crawdads Sing" has been on the top of the New York Times bestsellers list for more than 20 non-consecutive weeks.
The News Journal gathered data from the Delaware Division of Libraries to detail which books are tops at each of the state's 33 public libraries for the last six months, as well as those at the top of the waitlist for the last six months.
At the Bear Library, for instance, nine of the top 10 books for the last six months were books in the "Diary of a Wimpy Kid" series.
The children's book series by Jeff Kinney follows middle school teen Greg Heffley as he navigates school, friendships and other teen issues. "Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Double Down," the 11th book in the series, topped Bear's list. The first book came out online in 2004 and the first physical book came out in April of 2007. The 14th book in the series is set to release in November of this year.
The only non-"Diary of a Wimpy Kid" book on Bear's list was "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" by J.K. Rowling, another children's book. According to 2010 Census data, 23.9% of Bear's 19,371 population is under the age of 18.
Bear Library manager Eric Kuhn said the library is in a suburban area with many families so the library does whatever it can to support that community. Unlike other libraries that may have six to eight copies of the "Diary of a Wimpy Kid" books, they have more than a dozen because they see such a high circulation with youth fiction.
The library opened in 1998 and was not originally in the New Castle County master plan for libraries but area residents rallied and insisted on having a library there.
"That library came out because residents in that area demanded it," said Delaware State Librarian Annie Norman. Like most libraries, it often reflects the tastes of the people in the area.
Over in the Route 9 Library, manager Alix Jefferson said that when they first opened in 2017 they had stocked the shelves with classics and popular books you'd be used to seeing in every library.
Over time they began to change around displays and stock books that would be more reflective of the surrounding neighborhoods.
According to 2010 Census data, 26.1% of News Castle county's 538,479 population is African American and a large pocket lives in the areas surrounding Route 9.
Neighborhoods like Dunleith, which is right across the street from the library, are predominantly African American because they started as some of the first neighborhoods marketed to African American vets in the 1950s.
Inside the library and innovation center, there are prominent displays for African American nonfiction, children's books and authors. Zora Neal Hurston, Oprah and other African American authors are featured at the checkout counter.
Biographies of famous African Americans like Malcolm X and Martin Luther King have their own section to the right of the entrance. The kids section is filled with covers propped up of small black children with afros and braids.
Jefferson said that since fine-tuning the library, he sees a lot more browsing from patrons. The biggest trend he sees, however, is a tendency towards urban fiction.
The top book at the Route 9 Library is "An Extraordinary Union" by Alyssa Cole. The novel follows free woman Ellen "Elle" Burns whose photographic memory comes in handy as she poses as a spy in a Confederate home. While undercover, she meets a fellow spy, Malcolm McCall, an Irish Immigrant posing as a Confederate soldier.
The spy romance was published in 2017.
Libraries seeing uptick in electronic reading Delaware State Librarian Annie Norman says one of the major trends the libraries have been seeing is an uptick in e-book readership and audiobook usage.
She said that if the circulation of e-books and audiobooks was its own library, it would be the second-largest library, topped only by the Brandywine Hundred's.
In this last fiscal year, 557,994 e-books and audio books have been checked out statewide. Brandywine Hundred's library saw 598,620 physical books checked out.
Since the launch of e-books in 2011, three million e-books and audio books have been checked out.
In total, for fiscal year 2019, 5,630,551 books, e-books and audio books have been checked out.
For the state, the top e-book for the last six months was "The President is Missing: A Novel" by James Patterson and former US President Bill Clinton. The political thriller was published in June 2018 and was checked out 801 times since March. It was followed by "Where the Crawdads Sing."
Generally, Delawareans love to read fiction that tops national reading lists such as The New York Times bestsellers, Reese Witherspoon's book club, Oprah Winfrey's book suggestions and others, Norman said.
Both "The President is Missing" and "Where the Crawdads Sing" have appeared on several of these lists.
"People like a shared experience. That's why book clubs are so popular. That's why bookstagram on Instagram is so popular. Because you like being a part of the conversation so that does drive a lot of the reading in Delaware," said Delaware Division of Libraries deputy director Beth-Ann Ryan.
One of the exceptions to this trend is the North Wilmington Library. Unlike much of the state, which sees fiction novels at the top of the list, they are full of non-fiction.
The top book is former first lady Michelle Obama's autobiography "Becoming" followed by "Anger Management for Everyone: Ten Proven Strategies to Help You Control Anger and Live a Happier Life" by Howard Kassinove and Matthew McKay.
The first fiction book comes in at number nine and is romance novel "Fulfillment" by Barbara Delinsky.

IT’S NOT EASYBEING GREEN

Texto completo: On Jan. 1 of this year, I began cooking as a vegetarian. Not because I became vegetarian - that would be professionally untenable - but because my younger child did, thus upending most of my hard-won weeknight cooking strategies.
I didn’t think of myself as an animal-centric cook, just your basic modern omnivore. Steaks and lamb chops were an occasional treat, not a routine dinner. But I soon realized that I’d been relying on shortcuts like bacon, anchovy paste, pancetta and fish sauce.
At the same time, I began research on a project about how to cook and eat with less impact on the environment. What I learned made me want to eat not only less meat but also less dairy, which can be just as harmful. It didn’t seem right to simply replace recipes that call for a pound of meat with recipes that call for a pound of cheese, so vegan cooking was also newly intriguing.
It didn’t seem impossible. I knew about putting vegetables at the center of the plate, I had mastered “put an egg on it,” and we already ate salad most nights. So I collected a fresh batch of recipes, laid in a supply of legumes and embarked on my new kitchen life.
The first few weeks, I did what felt normal: I cooked a couple of different things on the nights we all sat down to eat together. But dinner was never on the table before 9 p.m., the food was strangely unsatisfying and the kitchen was absolutely wrecked.
I tacked toward one-dish and one-pot meals. This worked for a while. We had penne with tomatoes and eggplant, followed by pad Thai, followed by macaroni and cheese, at which point there was a mutiny. Noodles every night were not the solution.
So I reached out to my trusted plant-based sources to find out why my omnivore’s skills produced vegetarian fails, and to reteach me how to cook. Here are their critiques:
To make sure dinner was filling, I was stuffing everyone with starch.
“A plant-based diet is not going to work exactly like a meat-based one,” said Rich Landau, chef and co-owner of Vedge and other vegetarian restaurants in Philadelphia and Washington. “It’s just not going to fill you up the same way.” In other words, it’s likely that a plant-based dinner at 7 p.m. may not carry everyone over until breakfast the next day. “Herbivores are grazers,” he added.
The fact that my kids were peckish at 9:30 p.m. didn’t mean that I had failed at dinner. It simply meant that I needed to lay in more substantial snacks and let go.
I needed to push more flavor into everything.
For meat eaters, the natural umami in meat and fish is satiating; even if the roasted potatoes alongside are plain and the salad dressing is basic, the savoriness brings satisfaction. Without that to lean on, everything on the plate wants to be thoroughly and thoughtfully seasoned, including basics like grains and beans.
“Just using enough salt will get you halfway there,” said Raquel Pelzel, author of “Umami Bomb” (Workman, 2019), a new book of vegetarian recipes built around umami-rich ingredients: cooked tomatoes, mushrooms and Parmesan cheese. Then, she said, build elements like sweetness, heat, acid and smoke. (Smoked paprika is vegan sorcery, used in everything that I once flavored with bacon. I picked up a new trick for the spice from “Sababa,” a new cookbook of Israel-inspired food: The author, Adeena Sussman, recommends stirring it in the end of cooking, to preserve its bright taste.)
Marinate everything that can be marinated, garnish everything that can be garnished (preferably with crunchy things like nuts and croutons) and season your cooking liquids (when you’re pressed for time, throw in a vegetable bouillon cube).
I was avoiding meat and dairy substitutes for no good reason.
Growing up among hippies made me perpetually suspicious of anything offered as a healthier substitute for something good. The fact is that there are many products on the market that are delicious on their own terms, and more and more foods that are doing a good job of pretending to be meat and dairy. Go out and try them. Thanks to the recipes in “I Can Cook Vegan,” a new book from chef Isa Chandra Moskowitz, coconut oil is my new best friend.
I was trying to cook too many things.
I phoned a fiendishly good home cook of my acquaintance, whose children have been through vegan, vegetarian and pescatarian stages. She spoke some hard truths. “The thing about a vegetable is that you can’t just unwrap it, salt it, sear it and put it in the middle of the plate,” she said. Washing, peeling, cutting and sometimes even blanching must be done before you get to the cooking. “Vegetables just take more work,” she said.
We can’t let that dissuade us from cooking them, but we can remember that one or two vegetables to work with on a weeknight is plenty for most home cooks. A bunch of roasted carrots with yogurt and the nutty spice mix dukkah is dinner; a pile of lemony broccoli or broccoli raab on grilled bread is dinner; spicy tomato soup with bread and cheese is most definitely dinner.
I was being snobbish about frozen vegetables.
Pulling off a weeknight vegetarian dinner with variety, like a sheet-pan dinner, a vegetable stew or a stir-fry, means having some parcooked vegetables on hand. New vegetarians are often advised to do a big vegetable shop once a week and prep everything at once. I did it, but was discouraged by the fact that at the end of all that labor, I still had to cook everything as the week went on.
Bhavna Patel, a home cook in Lake City, Florida, with a popular YouTube channel, grew up in Gujarat, India, where a majority of people are vegetarian or vegan. She has streamlined her family’s recipes, she said, and often relies on homemade frozen vegetables. If you are peeling and cutting them anyway, it’s just as easy to boil them in salted water and freeze them in resealable bags. Or, find a brand you like and buy them. The route to dinner is much faster. Her go-to meal for her sons, pav bhaji, is a vegetable curry served on toasted buttered buns.
I also needed to read recipes differently.
Even if a vegetarian recipe has a manageable number of ingredients and a short cooking time (like a stir-fry), it may take a while to get it on the table. That’s because many food publications, including NYT Cooking, measure the cook time starting at the point where the ingredients are already assembled and prepped. (There’s such a wide range of kitchen skills, it wouldn’t be possible to say how long it takes a given cook to do that work.) So a recipe that begins with a pound of washed, stemmed and sliced kale, two cups of chopped onions and six minced garlic cloves is always going to take longer than the estimated time.
I had to stop living in fear.
I felt guilty when my eyes strayed toward the stash of chicken stock in the freezer, and worried about adding fish sauce to a vegan recipe. But your kitchen is not a restaurant, and you are not a giant corporation subject to labeling laws. If everyone decides that the Caesar salad dressing needs anchovies this week, no one will break down your door or take away your membership card. You still get to decide how to cook in your home.

Texto completo: Make It Scream, Make It Burn
Leslie Jamison
Little Brown: 272 pages; $28

--
The essays in Leslie Jamison's new "Make It Scream, Make It Burn" are fabulously quirky and unconventional.
We meet a globally idolized whale, reincarnated children and online avatar junkies in a simulated web world where anyone can become a billionaire, an island owner or a parent of triplets.
While the topics are adventurous, the nonfiction collection tackles the all-too-human topic of yearning and its oft-corollary, obsession. Both gurgle beneath the writer's sonorous and captivating prose.
The author of "The Recovering" and "The Empathy Exams," Jamison is a blend of memoirist, critic and journalist. Born in Washington, D.C. and raised in L.A., she runs the graduate nonfiction program at Columbia University. She writes not apart or from a distance but up close and personal, pirouetting the "I" -- what I felt, what I heard, what I thought, what I saw -- to great effect.
In 14 essays, she takes us through the valleys of Longing, Looking and Dwelling to a place of ultimate connection.
The first essay, "52 Blue," showcases a solo whale dubbed "the loneliest whale on earth." Immortalized in a New York Times story, the whale wanders the North Pacific waters "singing" an abnormally high-pitched sound, a seemingly endless, pining journey that attracted lonely-hearts fans the world over during the 1990s.
"The natural world has always offered itself as a screen for human projection," Jamison writes about those who conflated their lives with the giant mammal's.
"The Romantics called this the pathetic fallacy. Ralph Waldo Emerson called it 'intercourse with heaven and earth.' We project our fears and longings onto everything we're not -- every beast, every mountain -- and in this way we make them somehow kin. It's an act of humbling and longing and claiming all at once. Often, we're not even aware that we're doing it."
We see that yearning too in the book's next section, Looking, where Jamison explores the act of documentation -- specifically Civil War photography ("No Tongue Can Tell"), the Sri Lankan Civil War ("Up in Jaffna") and America's Southern poor ("Make It Scream, Make It Burn").
But we see obsession steer toward the pathological in the remarkable story "Maximum Exposure," which chronicles a California photographer identified only as Annie who returns to Mexico to document the same subjects for 25 years.
Jamison senses a kinship with the photographer: "Annie's impulse to keep expanding her project plays out a certain fantasy I've felt in my own work: to put no boundaries around my evocation of my subjects, to make them infinite, to let them keep going on forever. Representing people always involves reducing them, and calling a project 'done' involves making an uneasy truce with that reduction. But some part of me rails against that compression. Some part of me wants to keep saying: there's more, there's more, there's more. It's why I often write ten thousand more words than I was assigned."
Her last section, the Dwelling, chimes best. Here the topics come from her own life; weddings ("Rehearsals"), eloping to Las Vegas ("The Real Smoke") and stepmotherhood ("Daughter of a Ghost"). Finally, the stunning "The Quickening" juxtaposes the birth of her daughter with her former anorectic years. And it's here where this intelligent and vibrant collection comes full circle.
"For me, the notion of making life scream is less about pain and more about urgency," Jamison writes in Entertainment Weekly, explaining how this collection came about. "It's about finding a kind of primal cry inside the ordinary house, the ordinary marriage, the ordinary morning. It's about looking at something so closely that you feel it starting to smolder under your gaze.
"It was what I wanted to do in this book: Make life scream. Make it burn. Make it funny. Make it strange. Make it sing."

Texto completo: "Bob's Burgers" returns for a 10th season on Fox. And "Shark Tank" is back on ABC.
What's on TV
BOB'S BURGERS 9 p.m. on Fox. The boisterous Belcher family is back for a 10th season. Bob plans to surprise Linda for their anniversary, but things get complicated when Tina, Louise and Gene get involved. The episode features guest voices from Megan Mullally, Jillian Bell and Brooke Dillman.
SHARK TANK 9 p.m. on ABC. Season 11 kicks off with entrepreneurs from across the country. A team from Nashville offers a snack bar that blocks your body from absorbing fat while you eat it. And one from New York introduces eco-friendly cleaning supplies. There's also a mother and daughter from Hawaii who present a baby teething spoon. This season features some new guest sharks, including Katrina Lake, the chief executive and founder of Stitch Fix; Daniel Lubetzky, the founder and chief executive of Kind snacks company; Maria Sharapova, the tennis champion and founder of Sugarpova; and Anne Wojcicki, a co-founder and chief executive of 23andMe.
60 MINUTES 7:30 p.m. on CBS. Twenty years ago it was exceedingly rare to spot a great white shark. But recently the sharks have found their way close to shore, particularly in Cape Cod, Mass., and close to a plethora of gray seals that are perfect for a meal. But visitors to the beaches have become increasingly alarmed. In its 52nd season premiere, "60 Minutes" sent Bill Whitaker to report.
What's Streaming
ISN'T IT ROMANTIC (2019) Streaming on HBO platforms. Natalie (Rebel Wilson) is a New York architect going through a slump. She is not respected at work and her love life is lackluster. But things change after she gets mugged. Suddenly, Natalie's life resembles a romantic comedy and she is the star. Her new world follows the classic tropes of the film genre, including a meet-cute with a sexy Australian man (Liam Hemsworth), a spontaneous dance number and a massive apartment with a fabulous wardrobe. In his review for The New York Times, Ben Kenigsberg wrote: "Wilson, leaning on her comic persona to compensate for the script's lack of wit or inventiveness, is a reliable deadpanner. Her one-liners -- calling the alternate universe she's trapped in "'The Matrix" for lonely women,' for example -- are funny enough to carry this featherweight movie as far as it can go, which isn't far."
TRANSPARENT: MUSICALE FINALE Stream on Amazon Prime. The two hour movie musical represents the end of the award-winning series starring Judith Light, Gaby Hoffmann, Amy Landecker and Jay Duplass. With the death of Maura (the character played by Jeffrey Tambor, who left the show in 2017 after sexual misconduct allegations), Shelly (Light) writes a musical to help her family cope with the loss. The musical numbers chronicle the stages of grief. In his review for The Times, James Poniewozik wrote, "The musical framing -- bold colors and blunt lyrics -- hammers flat what had been elegantly shaded characters, even when the individual songs work."

As the Regular Season Ends, Awards Season Looms

Texto completo: The hardware won't be handed out until after the postseason, but as the regular season wraps up this weekend, here are the players and managers who deserve baseball's top honors.
The Baseball Writers' Association of America has presented awards for decades, and despite an ever-changing media landscape, those honors have retained their prominence within the sport. Some news organizations, including The New York Times, do not allow their writers to vote -- but we still have opinions, and here's how the awards picture looks as the regular season scrambles to the finish on Sunday afternoon.
Cody Bellinger, Dodgers
This race was a lot more fun before Christian Yelich broke his kneecap with a foul ball on Sept. 10, ending his season. Yelich still played in 130 games for the Milwaukee Brewers -- as many or more than past winners like Mickey Mantle (1962), Willie Stargell (1979), George Brett (1980) and Barry Bonds (2003).
Yelich hit .329 with 44 homers, 30 steals and a league-best 1.100 on-base-plus-slugging percentage. He was even better this year than he was last season, when he won the award. But he is up against Cody Bellinger, whose all-around performance for the Los Angeles Dodgers this season was even better.
Bellinger is close enough in O.P.S. (1.025 through Thursday), with more home runs and total bases. And if his average (.301 through Thursday) holds up, he will be the first player since Albert Pujols in 2009 to hit .300 with at least 45 homers, 110 runs scored and 110 runs batted in. He has also been, perhaps, the N.L.'s best defensive outfielder.
Would Yelich have reached those figures, too? Almost certainly. But we can only use what actually happened, and Bellinger was the N.L.'s best from start to finish.
Runners-up: 2) Yelich, Brewers; 3) Ronald Acuna Jr., Braves; 4) Anthony Rendon, Nationals; 5) Ketel Marte, Diamondbacks; 6) Nolan Arenado, Rockies; 7) Pete Alonso, Mets; 8) Freddie Freeman, Braves; 9) Juan Soto, Nationals; 10) Eugenio Suarez, Reds
Mike Trout, Angels
It is possible to overthink the A.L. Most Valuable Player Award race and find a reason not to honor Mike Trout. The Angels had another losing season. Trout did not play after Sept. 7 because of a foot injury. Alex Bregman was terrific for Houston, and shifted from third base to shortstop when Carlos Correa was hurt. The Yankees' D.J. LeMahieu was a force at three infield spots as teammates fell to injuries all around him.
Trout's narrative was not as compelling. He was simply the best in the league, as he always is, providing more value than any other player. Yes, his teammates often failed to translate that value into victories -- but Trout's value was still there.
He hit 45 homers, batted .291 and leads the A.L. in on-base percentage (.438) and slugging percentage (.645). He scored 110 runs and drove in 104. He had 303 total bases (more than he had in 2016, his last M.V.P. season), and came to bat 600 times despite the injury.
Trout did it all, of course, while meeting the demands of center field. How many other center fielders (with a minimum 100 games) have hit 45 homers with an O.P.S. as high as Trout's 1.083? Hack Wilson in 1930, Joe DiMaggio in 1937 and Mickey Mantle in 1956 and 1961.
Runners-up: 2) Bregman, Astros; 3) LeMahieu, Yankees; 4) Marcus Semien, A's; 5) Xander Bogaerts, Red Sox; 6) Justin Verlander, Astros; 7) Nelson Cruz, Twins; 8) Gerrit Cole, Astros; 9) Matt Chapman, A's; 10) George Springer, Astros
Jacob deGrom, Mets
The Dodgers' Hyun-Jin Ryu was the Cy Young leader through July. But a stint on the injured list and a dreadful late-summer stretch (21 earned runs in 19 innings over four starts) opened up the race, and Jacob deGrom took over.
Just like in 2018, the Mets have made a maddening habit of wasting deGrom's brilliance. They will again have a losing record in his starts -- they were 14-18 last year and 14-18 again this year. But deGrom has done his job better than any other N.L. pitcher, logging more than 200 innings while leading the N.L. in strikeouts (255) and WHIP (0.971), categories in which he finished second last season, with a 2.43 E.R.A.
Runners-up: 2) Stephen Strasburg, Nationals; 3) Ryu, Dodgers; 4) Max Scherzer, Nationals; 5) Jack Flaherty, Cardinals
Justin Verlander, Astros
Justin Verlander won the American League Cy Young and Most Valuable Player Awards in 2011. Since then, he has been runner-up for the Cy Young three times -- in 2012, 2016 and 2018 -- without winning it again. The voters should fix that this year, despite strong competition from his Houston teammate Gerrit Cole.
Cole's sublime season should earn him a fortune in free agency this winter -- he topped 300 strikeouts for the first time and just turned 29 years old. But Verlander (20-6 with a 2.53 earned run average going into his final start) has been better in nearly every category, combining durability and dominance like no other pitcher and punctuating it with a no-hitter on Sept. 1.
Runners-up: 2) Cole, Astros; 3) Shane Bieber, Indians; 4) Charlie Morton, Rays; 5) Lance Lynn, Rangers
Pete Alonso, Mets
This has been an extraordinary year for N.L. rookies. There were stars in San Diego (starter Chris Paddack and shortstop Fernando Tatis Jr.), .300 hitters in Pittsburgh (second baseman Kevin Newman and outfielder Bryan Reynolds), and valuable contributors in Arizona (first baseman Christian Walker), Cincinnati (outfielder Aristides Aquino), Milwaukee (second baseman Keston Hiura), St. Louis (infielder Tommy Edman) and San Francisco (outfielder Mike Yastrzemski).
Pete Alonso's production makes him the clear winner, of course, and the Mets deserve credit for allowing him to play a full season, without delaying his service-time clock by holding him in the minors for the first few weeks. But two rookies were rotation anchors for division winners, and at least deserve consideration: Atlanta's Mike Soroka and St. Louis' Dakota Hudson. Neither specialized in strikeouts, but both logged quality innings without giving up many hits, and Soroka's 2.60 E.R.A. is among the majors' best.
Runners-up: 2) Soroka, Braves; 3) Reynolds, Pirates
Yordan Alvarez, Astros
The A.L. equivalent to Alonso is the Chicago White Sox' Eloy Jimenez -- a much-hyped rookie who was promoted on opening day, without regard to service time. In Jimenez's case, the White Sox welcomed him only after he had signed a long-term contract that could tie him to the team for eight seasons. Jimenez matched the buildup with a strong season.
But Houston's Yordan Alvarez did more in fewer games. Alvarez averaged roughly one run batted in per game, blasting 27 home runs in 83 games through Wednesday, with a 1.099 O.P.S. That is quite a return for Josh Fields, the middle reliever Houston traded to the Dodgers for Alvarez in 2016. He's got a long way to go before he can rank with Roberto Clemente and Pedro Martinez as future superstars the Dodgers gave away, but Alvarez is at least on the path.
Runners-up: 2) John Means, Orioles; 3) Jimenez, White Sox
Craig Counsell, Brewers
When the Brewers won the N.L. Central last season, they got crucial production from Jesus Aguilar, Corbin Burnes, Jhoulys Chacin, Jeremy Jeffress, Corey Knebel and Travis Shaw.
All of those players fizzled this season, Christian Yelich got hurt down the stretch -- and the Brewers' celebrated pitching coach in 2018, Derek Johnson, left before the season for Cincinnati. Yet with a run differential that suggested the Brewers should be roughly a .500 team, Craig Counsell again found a way to make it work.
Runners-up: 2) Torey Lovullo, Diamondbacks; 3) Mike Shildt, Cardinals
Aaron Boone, Yankees
This award tends to go to the manager perceived to have done the most with the least. Understandably, then, no Yankees manager has won it since Joe Torre in 1998. With high payrolls come high expectations.
But Aaron Boone is the choice now, for leading the Yankees to a runaway division title despite an unrelenting barrage of injuries. As a player in 2009, Boone underwent heart surgery in spring training. He was 36 and could have retired, but he fought back to finish his career on his terms. His players were just as relentless this season, making Boone the first manager ever to win 100 games in each of his first two seasons.
Runners-up: 2) Kevin Cash, Rays; 3) Bob Melvin, Athletics

Texto completo: WEST LAFAYETTE — The Meridian Community Health Speaker Series will feature award-winning author Sam Quinones on Monday, Sept. 30, for a program aimed at bringing awareness and local solutions to efforts to combat the opiate crisis.
Quinones, a journalist, storyteller, former L.A. Times reporter and the author of "Dreamland: The True Tale of America's Opiate Epidemic," will be speaking 11 a.m.-1 p.m. Monday, Sept. 30, at the Ross-Ade Stadium.
After Quinones' talk will be a panel discussion by community leaders, examining the issues and solutions from a local perspective and working to engage the audience discussing issues related to drug addiction, the opioid epidemic and ideas for local solutions, according to a release from Meridian. Panelists will include: Lafayette Mayor Tony Roswarski; Honorable Kristen McVey, Tippecanoe Superior Court 5; Stafka Poweleit, Meridian Addictions and Recovery Center; John Catron, Innovative Medicine; Jason Huber, Community Corrections; Khala Hochstedler, Tippecanoe Department of Health; Grace Paton, Tippecanoe Department of Health; and moderator Michael Budd, United Way of Greater Lafayette.
Quinones has spent more than three decades immersed in the origins and culture where the opioid creation and use in Mexico originated, before expanding to the United States, according to a release.
His firsthand accounts present a foundation for how the opioid epidemic began and grew by way of retailing black tar heroin and addiction through pain medications as a parallel.
His career as a journalist has spanned almost 30 years. After living for 10 years as a freelance writer in Mexico, where he wrote his first two books, Quinones returned to the United States in 2004 to work for The L.A. Times, covering immigration, drug trafficking, neighborhood stories and gangs. In 2014, Quinones resigned from the paper to return to freelance writing, working for National Geographic, Pacific Standard Magazine, the New York Times, Los Angeles Magazine, among other publications.
This is a free event hosted by Meridian Health Services and Meridian's Addiction and Recovery Center in support with North Central Health Services (NCHS) at River Bend Hospital, United Way of Greater Lafayette, and Greater Lafayette Commerce, and Purdue University Nursing Department. A complimentary luncheon will be provided by Meridian Health Services.

Texto completo: Gary Bogue never sought out the spotlight, but when it shined in his direction, he knew how to use it.
He entertained and informed readers with his pets and wildlife newspaper column for more than four decades. He started the nation's first wildlife rehabilitation hospital, now known as theLindsay Wildlife Experience, in Walnut Creek. He knew how to charm both snakes and household pets.
Bogue, who has been called a local treasure, died Thursday at his Benicia home. He was 81.
For 42 years, Bogue was the heart of the Contra Costa Times, answering hundreds of letters a week from readers who often said Bogue was the main reason they subscribed.
He was a rarity in the newspaper world, a columnist who was devoted to answering questions about pets and wildlife. Several years ago when a reporter from The New York Times interviewed him about that distinction, he was dubbed the "Ann Landers of California Wildlife."
Bogue's interest in animals and humanity began at an early age. His father died when Bogue was 4 years old, and he went to live with his grandparents in Agra, Oklahoma, a small farming town. His first experience with animals were chickens and cows, including one hen that took a liking to him and followed him wherever he went.
"And then this rooster, who liked the hen, didn't like me," Bogue once recounted. "One day, he charged and pecked me. My grandfather grabbed him, and we had him for dinner. It was then that we decided that maybe a cat or a dog would be better."
His fascination with animals wasn't limited to the farm and domestic varieties. There wasn't much to do on the farm, outside of chores, Bogue said, so he'd sometimes lie on the ground observing red ants. Whenever he could, he escaped to the wilder areas.
When he moved to the Bay Area as a teen, his insatiable curiosity found new animals to observe. When he and a Pleasant Hill High classmate got a strange bright green snake from a visiting sailor, they took it a UC Berkeley herpetologist, who ordered the boys to stand back and then scolded them for handling a venomous African boomslang snake. The expert told the boys it wasn't enough to be curious, you have to know what you're doing. Bogue took the lesson to heart, reading everything he could find on animals and their habitats.
His first jobs, as a milkman and life insurance salesman, paid the bills but didn't exactly inspire him. Then he stumbled into the job that changed not only his life but the lives of innumerable Bay Area families, their pets and the region's wildlife.
Bogue had been intrigued by what was going on in the old pump house in Walnut Creek's Larkey Park, where the then-Alexander Lindsay Junior Museum was taking shape. When he offered suggestions to improve how animals were held, he was hired as curator. He worked there from 1967 to 1979 and opened the museum's rehabilitation hospital, the first of its kind.
"People kept bringing in injured animals," Bogue later said, "so we had to do something."
Rosanne Siino, president of the Lindsay Wildlife Experience board, says Bogue's foresight in creating a place where people could bring in injured wildlife for treatment and rehabilitation was truly world changing. Scores of such hospitals now exist.
"He wasn't just a guy who believed in the mission," Siino says, "he lived it. That's what he did for Lindsay and every other organization he was involved in, and even in the books he wrote. It was all about having that important connection. The world has lost a wildlife champion."
During Bogue's days at Lindsay, he approached Times owner and publisher Dean Lesher about writing a pets and wildlife column for the newspaper. He thought it would help the fledgling museum get some attention. Bogue's column launched in 1970 at $5 per day.
It was his work with the paper that drew the attention of then-Oakland A's manager Tony La Russa. In 1990, a game at the Coliseum was briefly halted when a stray cat ran onto the field. La Russa captured the cat and several days later showed up at the Times office.
"The receptionist called and said there's a Mr. La Russa here to see you," Bogue recalled.
The cat made La Russa realize how hard it was for stray and abandoned animals to find new homes. He asked Bogue what could be done. The result was Tony La Russa's Animal Rescue Foundation.
Bogue used his column to help environmental groups, as well, in their efforts to raise money to preserve open space. His readers gave thousands of dollars to Save Mount Diablo, the John Muir Land Trust and others. In 2012, the Land Trust named a Lafayette trail after Bogue and presented him with a lifetime achievement award.
John Muir Land Trust Executive Director Linus Eukel credits Bogue with helping to save large swaths of East Bay open space.
"He was an extraordinary man, who typified excellence, devotion to service and human kindness all at once" Eukel says. "From the top of the Gary Bogue Trail on Acalanes Ridge you can see many of the lands that Gary helped protect. The trail is a fitting tribute to Gary as it links so many people and communities together, just as Gary did throughout his life and career."
Bogue barely slowed down when he retired in 2012. He would joke and say he hadn't retired, he had just switched jobs. He continued producing children's books with local artist Chuck Todd. The books, which include "There's an Opossum in My Backyard" and "There's a Hummingbird in My Backyard," are aimed at teaching children about wildlife and how to respect it.
"Gary had a way of championing something and making it grow and flourish," Todd says. "He did that with his wildlife column and his work with the Lindsay Wildlife Museum. He did that with his wildlife and nature advocacy. He also did that with me. We started as colleagues, growing into close friends and co-creators working on projects and books together. And my family grew to become part of his family. I'll deeply miss Gary and our wild adventures together."
He is survived by his wife, Lois Kazakoff, whom he worked with at the Times they stunned everyone when they secretly married and his children and grandchildren. Services are pending.

Now President Trump's risking whistleblower's life

Texto completo: We now know that The New York Times has reported that the government official who blew the whistle on President Donald Trump's attempts to use a foreign government for his own corrupt purposes was a member of the CIA who was detailed to the White House. We should not know this, because in a matter of days or perhaps hours – maybe even by the time you read this – we will probably know the man's name and everything else about him.
This is a problem, because there are people who want to do harm to this whistleblower and his accomplices. Prominent among them is the president of the United States himself, who has already said that he would like to know the identities of those who have placed him in jeopardy (or, in yet more jeopardy) of impeachment. Indeed, Trump thinks the whistleblower should be dealt with as an enemy spy and a traitor to the state.
In his usual emulation of the mob bosses and dictators he admires, the president said: "I want to know who's the person, who's the person who gave the whistleblower the information? Because that's close to a spy. You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now."
Trump means the death penalty, of course.
This is the same president who thought he could mend fences with the intelligence community at the start of his term by giving a speech at the most sacred place at the Central Intelligence Agency, in front of the wall of unmarked stars that commemorate American intelligence professionals who gave their lives in the course of their duties. As usual, Trump couldn't help himself, and instead of showing respect to the people who died in anonymity to protect the nation, he talked about his favorite subject: himself.
This time, a CIA officer is trying to protect his nation by warning his superiors of a danger emanating from the Oval Office itself. This was not some rogue nitwit stuffing classified material in her pantyhose like Reality Winner, or a self-important stooge like Edward Snowden collaborating with our avowed enemies overseas.

White House concealed transcripts of calls with Putin and Saudi royal family on highly classified system

Texto completo: The White House kept transcripts of President Trump’s calls with Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Saudi royal family on a highly classified computer system to keep them from becoming public.
The handling of Trump’s calls with foreign leaders has been highly scrutinized after a whistleblower complaint alleged the president pressured Ukraine to interfere in the 2020 presidential election. A transcript released by the White House of the call showed Trump urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, who is a front-runner for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, and his son Hunter.
The White House’s decision to place the transcript of Trump’s conversation with Zelensky on a separate computer system that few had access to was part of a whistleblower complaint about the administration’s interactions with Ukraine.
According to the New York Times, restrictions on some transcripts of Trump’s calls were imposed after leaks of details of his conversations with the leaders of Mexico and Australia were leaked.
The White House implemented tighter restrictions after Trump’s Oval Office discussion with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and then-Russian Ambassador to the U.S. Sergey Kislyak leaked to the media, bringing scrutiny over whether Trump had revealed classified information to the Russians.
Current and former officials defended the decision to place the transcripts on a secure system, pointing to the number of leaks from the White House. The Trump administration said Friday that National Security Council lawyers made the decision to place the Ukraine phone call on a classified system.
Russia said Friday it hopes the contents of Putin’s calls with Trump are kept private.
“We would like to hope that we would not see such situations in our bilateral relations, which already have plenty of quite serious problems,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.

Readers and writers: Eliza Wheeler builds a charming ‘Home in the Woods’

Texto completo: When Eliza Wheeler was growing up in Solon Springs, Wis., she’d follow a little dirt path through the trees to visit her Grandma and Grandpa, Marvel and Ray Swanson, who lived next door.
Grandma Marvel’s favorite reminiscences were about the years in the 1930s when her family was evicted from their home and her widowed mother took her eight children to live in an empty tarpaper shack in the woods where they stayed for six years. The little family had nothing, but the kids stuck together and made a life following the seasons, picking berries, hunting, canning, running around the woods, doing chores and playing games.
Wheeler tells her grandmother’s story in “Home in the Woods,” the second children’s book she wrote and illustrated.
“When I look back, I marvel at my childhood,” Wheeler said in a conversation from her condo in Minneapolis’ Uptown neighborhood.
“We lived in this tiny town 40 miles south of Duluth and I was surrounded by two brothers and cousins,” she recalled. “Things were spread out in the country and there were miles and miles for us to be outside in every season, roaming over fields and woods, streams and rivers and lakes. So it was a neat experience drawing the images for this book because I was drawing my grandmother’s childhood but also drawing my own. It was the place I also grew up and it was extra special trying to capture the trees and plants.”
Young readers will love Wheeler’s attention to detail, including maps on the book’s endpapers that show the shack and interesting places around it.
Wheeler was born in Duluth to Gary and Jean Swanson, retired teachers who live in Solon Springs except for three months in Florida every year. Her grandparents owned Swanson’s Motel Cabins & Campground, which has been in the family for four generations and is run now by one of Wheeler’s cousins.
Drawing and painting were Wheeler’s loves, but at the University of Wisconsin, Stout, in Menominee, she opted for graphic design because it seemed more practical for earning a living. It wasn’t a good choice.
“I realized over time as I started doing graphic design work I really didn’t enjoy doing all my work on the computer,” she recalled.
After graduation Eliza and her husband, Adam, who she met at college, moved to Los Angeles where they lived for 10 years. She worked graphic design as a day job and did “random drawings” at night.
When one of those drawings was included in a show sponsored by the Society of Children’s Book Writers and Illustrators, one of the judges (“He could see I was making rookie mistakes”) suggested she join the Society of Children’s Book Writers and Illustrators.
“I felt an instant connection from the very first conference,” Wheeler says of the organization. “I knew that children’s illustration was what I wanted to do. It took me three years of learning how to revise my portfolio to make it professional and market it to publishing companies and literary agents.”
After doing some freelance illustrating work, Wheeler debuted as an author/illustrator in 2013 with her picture book “Miss Maple’s Seeds.” The story of a tiny lady who lives in a maple tree house, flies around on a bird and rescues orphan seeds, was a New York Times bestseller and sold more than a million copies.
“The actual writing of that book was extremely fast, but doing the artwork is way more labor and time intensive than I ever would have thought,” Wheeler says. “It’s a long process, revising, going back and forth with the art editor, pacing out the book. By the time you get to approved sketches it’s been months.”
Since the release of “Miss Maple’s Seeds,” Wheeler has illustrated more than a dozen picture books, chapter books, and middle grade novels for major U.S. publishers, including Newbery Honor Book “Doll Bones” (written by Holly Black).

“Home in the Woods” is getting the same praise as “Miss Maple’s Seeds,” with starred reviews in Kirkus and Booklist, which said: “Wheeler’s evocative full-bleed illustrations, rendered with dip pens, India Ink, and watercolor, draw readers completely into each page … the detailed imagery allows for the incredible efficiency of poetic prose, which always finds the right note.” .
Yet Wheeler says she never intended to become a writer.
“Illustration work has come naturally to me but I had to learn writing and to get better and grow at it,” she says. “It’s the craft I feel most out of my element. The thing that’s deceiving about picture books is they look really simple, but they are not simple. It’s about finding a rhythm, a poetry, and distilling something down to words that express an idea. It’s way more editing and rewriting than people think.”
Wheeler is being too modest about her writing. “Home in the Woods,” which is narrated by 6-year-old Marvel, is filled with lyrical passages:
Snow falls in a blanket of diamonds/
all around the shack./
The jack pines sway above as we/
fall asleep close together./
but Mom stays awake/
into the night…whispering/
to/
the/
stars.
That picture and passage take up two facing pages that show the children snuggled next to their mother, and it’s a tribute to Wheeler’s artistic talent that so much can be read on the woman’s face — longing, perhaps for her husband, some tiredness, as well as worry and hope for the future.
Wheeler created the first mockups for “Home in the Woods” in 2017 when she won the prestigious Sendak Fellowship Award, which paid for a month-long illustration retreat to the upstate New York farm owned by the late Maurice Sendak.
“After ‘Miss Maple’s Seeds’ was finished, (editor) Nancy Paulsen asked me to send her new ideas in the form of little, one-paragraph pitches,” Wheeler recalled. “I gathered up 5 or 6 ideas and on a last-minute whim I added this idea for my family’s story. I never thought I would try to do this as a book for national release. At most I thought maybe I would someday make a little book for the family that documented Grandma’s story. When Nancy called me, she confidently said, ‘Your Grandma’s story is the one you need to write’ ”
Wheeler credits Paulsen with helping craft the story into something for a universal audience.
“I wouldn’t have known how to do that. It was so specific and personal,”she admits. “I had all these true stories and real memories and I had to shift between fact and fiction, to step back and look at the big picture, figuring how to express the spirit of (the children’s) experience.”
It took Wheeler 25 drafts and six years to write the book.
“My original pitch was that the story was basically about living in a shack, growing up and buying a home for their mom.” she recalls. “But Nancy said, ‘Keep it there, in the shack.’ Then I realized that for the characters it’s not a physical story arc but an emotional journey. I’m taking on their struggles and sadness, and finding a way to hope and joy at where they were.”
Of the eight siblings who appear in the book, four are still alive, including Grandma Marvel. But the shack is gone.
“We went out there, about 10 miles from where we live, and all that’s left is a sort of depression in the ground where the root cellar was,” Wheeler says.
“Even though my Grandma and her brother and sisters struggled for sure, they talk about their years in the shack as the best time of their lives. There was so much joyfulness.”
As young Marvel says in the book:
“Our/
laughter/
echoes/
through/
the/
trees.”

Texto completo: Greta Thunberg has been dubbed by the media as a "climate change activist" and a teen "eco-warrior." She was at the United Nations in New York last Monday to appear before diplomats and others at a "climate action summit." Only the UN has less credibility than a teenager.
Thunberg is on a world tour promoting the latest end-of-the-planet scenario. By the way, shouldn't she be in school? Reporters won't ask because most appear to buy into her secular doctrine that the apocalypse is just around the corner.
Thunberg claims "people are dying" because the Earth is getting hotter. She warns that adults had better wake up or they will burn in ecological hell or perhaps even the real thing. Her theological qualifications have yet to be examined. Think back to when you were 16 and believed you knew it all. At 18, an adult called me "precocious" (he didn't mean it as a compliment). I had to look up the meaning in a dictionary. It was a humbling experience.
As their adolescent brains continue to develop, most teenagers know only what their teachers and textbooks tell them and maybe their parents, if they still listen to them. Science textbooks mostly embrace the climate change scenario, so why wouldn't kids believe what they read and what they're taught?
Thunberg was preparing to speak to the assembled adults at the UN when President Trump walked in ahead of her. The man knows showmanship. The expression on Thunberg's face was priceless. If spitting fire contributed to "global warming," we'd have been in real trouble. It appears the girl is being held in intellectual captivity. She might benefit from consulting a list of "50 Years of Failed Eco-pocalytpic Predictions" compiled by the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI.org), the nonprofit libertarian think tank based in Washington, D.C. Just a few examples:
In 1967, the Los Angeles Times carried a story headlined "Dire Famine Forecast by 1975." The story said it might "already be too late."
On August 10, 1969, The New York Times quoted a 37-year-old scientist predicting a new ice age and that "everyone will disappear in a cloud of blue steam by 1989."
An April 16, 1970 story in the Boston Globe quoted Dr. Paul R. Erlich of the University of California, Riverside, predicting America will be "subject to water rationing by 1974 and food rationing by 1980." Erlich said the oceans would be as dead as Lake Erie in less than a decade. On July 9, 1971, The Washington Post, which, like most other media, now claims climate change and a warming planet is "settled science," thought differently then. It quoted Dr. S. I. Rasool of NASA and Columbia University. Rasool predicted a coming "new ice age." He was described as a "leading atmospheric scientist," so he should be believed, right? He predicted we had only about "50 or 60 years" to save ourselves from freezing to death. On her way back to Sweden, Ms. Thunberg should take along a copy of the CEI summary. She just may discover that some older people might know more than she does about most things and that those who preceded her in these "Chicken Little" hysterics were as wrong then as she is now.

Texto completo: Second lady Karen Pence twice rebuffed her husband on election night when he tried to kiss her, according to a book released in June.
“You got what you wanted, Mike. Leave me alone,” she told him, author Tom LoBianco wrote in Piety and Power: Mike Pence and the Taking of the White House.
The New York Times noted the interaction in a book review published Friday.
Karen first declined her husband’s affection when he leaned in to kiss her after then-Republican nominee Donald Trump received a concession call from Hillary Clinton. The future vice president tried again to kiss his wife when they were in their private suite, but “again she told him to back off,” the book says.
LoBianco reported that Karen was “livid” after the release of the Access Hollywood tape in which President Trump bragged about groping women without their consent.
Another book released this summer, American Carnage by Tim Alberta, said Karen was “apoplectic” about Trump’s comments and warned her husband “that she would no longer appear in public if he carried on as Trump’s running mate.”
Ultimately, the Pences came around to remaining on the ticket with Trump after he apologized to both of them. A few hours after the apology, the couple headed back out on the campaign trail to fundraise.
“I told Mike that we knew we were signing up for something unique,” Karen told a campaign aide, according to Piety and Power. “We knew there’d be times he’d say and do things we’d never do. We understood that. All the trepidation about — well, he says things off the cuff — we settled in our hearts before we decided to do this. Obviously, it’s disappointing, but it doesn’t change the mission.”

As Republicans face impeachment dilemma, Utah’s Sen. Mitt Romney is a lonely voice of concern

Texto completo: Washington • As House Democrats push forward with an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, Republicans have largely rushed to Trump’s defense, or at least tempered their criticism to avoid his furious reprisals.
Among the handful of exceptions, though, there has been none louder or more prominent than Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, a figure who once embodied the essence of the Republican Party before Trump commandeered it, and is now in a lonely category of his own.
Since the first reports a week ago that Trump urged President Volodymyr Zelenskiy of Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden set off a still-unfolding furor in the capital, Romney has repeatedly been the first Republican lawmaker to raise concerns about the president’s conduct.
Romney has pronounced himself “deeply troubled” by Trump’s effort to enlist a foreign leader for political assistance, and has refused to rule out impeaching the president.
Romney’s public statements reflect what many in his party believe privately but are almost uniformly unwilling to say: that they are faced with damning revelations about the president that are difficult to explain away, and are unsure of whether there is more damaging material to come. What’s more, they are contending with a leader whose appetite for political payback for real or imagined slights is insatiable, and who is responding to the crisis with angry new threats and accusations that will only increase the pressure on them to choose a side.
It amounts to an unenviable dilemma for Republicans at a consequential moment for the party. Any internal fractures over the next year could undermine both Trump’s reelection and Republican hopes for retaining their Senate majority and retaking the House.
To Romney, who represents a state where he is beloved and is unlikely to seek another office, it is a moment where he believes country should trump party.
“Each person should search their own heart and do what they think is right — which is just what I do,” he said.
Romney’s willingness to level measured criticism at Trump has annoyed liberal activists, who see his comments as woefully insufficient to the moment. It has also enraged the president’s most loyal allies, who view the Utah senator as a resentful foe. Yet it could prove most pivotal with a third constituency: his fellow lawmakers.
As Senate Republicans begin to grapple with the unappealing prospect of serving as jurors in the impeachment trial of a president of their own party, Romney has emerged as a crucial figure.
“He’s in a different place from many politicians still feeling out their place in the party and hoping to be president someday,” said Sen. Christopher Murphy, D-Conn., who has become friendly with Romney from their service together on the Foreign Relations Committee. “He’s a loyal Republican, but that’s not his first priority — he’s a bit of a throwback.”
For Romney and Trump, it is the latest, and perhaps last, installment of an off-and-never-really-on relationship between two men who shared little more than the same political ambition. It began when Romney, as the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, solicited Trump’s endorsement, and carried through 2016, when the former Massachusetts governor began the year as a ferocious critic of Trump but ended it as a supplicant, sharing dinner with a president-elect in hopes of becoming his secretary of state.
Now, though, Romney holds a crucial position of power. He could be part of an effort to eventually remove Trump from office, and is already in the ear — and perhaps conscience — of other Republicans.
He plays down his role, noting that he is not attempting to lead any sort of insurrection against the president.
“I spoke out because I believe this is a matter of importance and personal principle,” he said. “Nothing more, nothing less.”
But by reproaching Trump, he offers Democrats the ability to counter claims that the inquiry is a wholly partisan and politically fueled witch hunt, as the president has repeatedly called it. And Romney both provides cover for and exerts pressure on his fellow Republicans, who are anxiously calibrating what to say about a scandal that only deepened on Thursday when audio emerged of Trump privately suggesting that government officials who expressed concerns about his dealings with Ukraine deserve to be punished severely.
The president’s leading advisers recognize the threat posed by as high-profile a figure as Romney, perhaps the second most well-known elected Republican in Washington, and are trying to isolate him. After his critical remarks about the Ukraine affair, Trump hit back at the senator by posting a video on Twitter showing a glum Romney at the moment on election night in 2012 that he learned he had lost the presidential race.
“Mitt Romney is still disappointed he was never elected president of the United States and Donald Trump was,” said Corey Lewandowski, Trump’s former campaign manager and a prospect to lead the president’s public relations defense against impeachment.
Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., went even further, saying that Romney “knows that as long as Donald Trump is leading the GOP he is irrelevant.”
He said Romney was “desperate to be loved by the left and the media,” and was “forever bitter that my father succeeded where he so embarrassingly failed.”
Yet since Romney first went public with his alarm on Sunday — saying Trump’s alleged conduct was “troubling in the extreme” — other Republicans have gradually started to sound notes of concern.
On Wednesday, after viewing the secret complaint of an intelligence whistleblower who expressed concerns about Trump’s conduct, Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., adopted Romney’s formulation, calling the report “troubling,” and saying that Republicans “ought not just circle the wagons.” Sasse was once a vocal critic of Trump, but had dialed back his comments considerably ahead of his 2020 reelection race, and had received the president’s endorsement earlier this year.
Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said on Thursday that he was concerned about the claim in the report that White House officials sought to restrict access to the transcript of Trump’s call to Zelenskiy. Rep. Michael Turner, R-Ohio, a member of the Intelligence Committee, said at a hearing on the matter that Trump’s conversation “is not OK.”
Romney said he was not attempting to steer a party he believes is overwhelmingly in Trump’s grip. But as the 70-year-old contemplates what he acknowledges will likely be his last period of public service, his friends say he is appalled by what he sees as the president’s win-at-all-costs immorality and his party’s willingness to remain mum in the face of such misconduct.
Further, he is deeply uneasy with the behavior of Rudy Giuliani, the president’s personal lawyer and a rival to Romney in the 2008 Republican presidential primary.
“I’m not quite sure who he was acting on behalf of with Ukraine,” Romney said of Giuliani. (In response, the former New York mayor said: “Where is he on, Mars? I was acting on behalf of Donald Trump.”)
And even as he insisted he was not attempting to nudge other Republicans, it was impossible to miss his indignation.
“I can’t imagine being in the Senate or in any other position of responsibility and looking around to see who’s with you,” Romney said. “You stand for what you believe in.”
His challenge as the impeachment debate unfolds will be how to balance his outrage, and leverage his platform, without sounding more sanctimonious than righteous.
Appearing at a forum sponsored by The Atlantic magazine this week, he pointedly separated himself from other politicians, who he suggested were more susceptible to political considerations.
“It’s just in human nature to see things in a way that is consistent with your own worldview and your sense of what’s necessary for the preservation of your position of power,” Romney said. “I don’t know why I’m not afflicted to the same degree as perhaps others are in that regard; perhaps it’s because I’m old and have done other things.”
Some of his more pro-Trump colleagues are already voicing irritation at Romney, who they believe is overreacting to the revelations about the president’s dealings with Ukraine.
“I’m very troubled by anybody that’s looking for an excuse to see the downside in this,” said Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., repurposing Romney’s word. The Utah senator, he said, has “an ax to grind.”
Some of Romney’s associates believe his sense of outrage can shame at least those senators who, as Republican strategist Mike Murphy put it, “have some moral compass.”
But Murphy, a longtime Romney friend and anti-Trump Republican, said, “it’s going to take a while, even though the news cycle wants this in an hour.”

Marc Thiessen: Ukraine investigation stands to hurt Biden’s prospects

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — We don’t yet know whether President Trump delayed some military aid to Ukraine as leverage to get Ukraine’s president to reopen an investigation into Hunter Biden. But if we are concerned about U.S. officials inappropriately threatening aid to Ukraine, then there are others who have some explaining to do.
<img class="size-medium wp-image-2657222" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/Marc-Thiessen-color-2018-300x235.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="235" />
It got almost no attention, but in May, CNN reported that Sens. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., Richard Durbin, D-Ill., and Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., wrote a letter to Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Yuriy Lutsenko, expressing concern at the closing of four investigations they said were critical to the Mueller probe. In the letter, they implied that their support for U.S. assistance to Ukraine was at stake. Describing themselves as “strong advocates for a robust and close relationship with Ukraine,” the Democratic senators declared, “We have supported [the] capacity-building process and are disappointed that some in Kyiv appear to have cast aside these [democratic] principles to avoid the ire of President Trump,” before demanding Lutsenko “reverse course and halt any efforts to impede cooperation with this important investigation.”
So, it’s okay for Democratic senators to encourage Ukraine to investigate Trump, but it’s not okay for the president to allegedly encourage Ukraine to investigate Hunter Biden?
And then there is Joe Biden. In 2016, the then-vice president threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees to Ukraine if the government did not fire the country’s top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin. According to the New York Times, “Among those who had a stake in the outcome was Hunter Biden … who at the time was on the board of an energy company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch who had been in the sights of the fired prosecutor general.” The Post reports that it is “unclear how seriously Shokin — who was under fire by U.S. and European officials for not taking a more aggressive posture toward corruption overall — was scrutinizing Burisma when he was forced out.” But what is clear is that Biden bragged about getting him fired, declaring last year: “I looked at them and said, ‘I’m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money.’ Well, son of a b —. He got fired.”
This weekend, Biden told reporters, “I have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.” That is flatly untrue. Hunter admitted in an interview with the New Yorker that his father expressed concern about the Burisma post at least once: “Dad said, ‘I hope you know what you are doing,’ and I said, ‘I do.'” Moreover, the New Yorker reports that, “In December, 2015, as Joe Biden prepared to return to Ukraine, his aides braced for renewed scrutiny of Hunter’s relationship with Burisma. Amos Hochstein, the Obama Administration’s special envoy for energy policy, raised the matter with Biden.”
So, Biden was fully aware of his son’s involvement with Burisma when he pressured Ukraine to fire the prosecutor in 2016. He should have known that his using U.S. aid as leverage to force the prosecutor’s dismissal would create, at a bare minimum, the appearance of a conflict of interest.
On Tuesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., announced that Congress will initiate a formal impeachment inquiry over the Ukraine episode, a move Joe Biden endorsed in a speech, declaring, “It’s time for the Congress to fully investigate the conduct of this president.” Such an investigation will be far more damaging for Biden than the president. It will keep the story of Biden’s conflict of interest in the news through the 2020 election. Senate Republicans can demand that Hunter Biden testify, and subpoena Obama White House aides to explain under oath what the vice president knew and when he knew it.
Put aside the prosecutor’s firing. Hunter took the position with a Ukrainian natural gas company just a few weeks after his father visited Ukraine in 2014 to urge its government to increase its natural gas production. He had no expertise in Ukraine or natural gas. It will not just be Republicans calling this suspicious; nonpartisan experts in ethics law will testify that this a major conflict of interest.
And the focus will not just be on Ukraine but also how, as The Post reported, “for more than two decades, [Hunter’s] professional work often tracked with his father’s life in politics, from Washington to Ukraine to China.”
While Senate Republicans will not remove Trump from office, Democratic primary voters might decide that Biden and his troubles are a distraction they do not need. The irony is the Democrats’ investigation might do more to deny Biden the presidency than Trump.

Santa Anita is back for big meet; Track will be under scrutiny again, right up until the Breeders' Cup in November.

Texto completo: Horse racing, seemingly at another crossroads every month, gets ready for the most important meeting of the year when Santa Anita opens its fall racing schedule Friday under intense scrutiny. It's only a 23-day meeting, but it finishes Nov. 1-2 with more than $30 million in purses in the Breeders' Cup.
"My mind-set is to get through this meet and make it the best meet we've ever had," said Aidan Butler, the newly installed acting executive director of California racing for the Stronach Group, owners of Santa Anita and other tracks in the state and across the nation. "It's pretty important not just to Santa Anita but the whole industry. So, no pressure there at all."
Santa Anita is battling public perception issues as much as anything. The death of 30 horses during its winter-spring meeting brought national attention to the sport and calls from legislators to animal rights activists to shut down Santa Anita. It led to reforms in safety protocols and medication.

Southern California is on an unprecedented run of racing safety. There hasn't been a racing fatality since June 9 when Truffalino died during a turf race at Santa Anita. Two short Los Alamitos thoroughbred meetings and the signature summer meeting at Del Mar have gone without a racing death.
Since June 9, there have been five training fatalities, four at Del Mar and one this week at Santa Anita. Two of the Del Mar deaths were the result of a collision, not a physical breakdown. By comparison, the New York tracks of Belmont, Saratoga and Finger Lakes have had seven racing and five training deaths in September, according to the New York equine death and breakdown database.
"I think it's all behind us," trainer Bob Baffert said. "I think we went into Del Mar feeling a little bit [of pressure]. Usually Del Mar is just a little relaxed, but I think everybody was on red alert. Now coming back here, I can see the focus is back on horse racing. What happened this winter took a lot of the fun out of the sport."
It has been a year like none other for horse racing, starting with the six-month saga over the deaths at Santa Anita.
Then there was the first same-day disqualification in 145 years of a winning horse in the Kentucky Derby, which led to a series of lawsuits that are still being litigated.
Upon the death of the 30th horse at Santa Anita, Hall of Fame trainer Jerry Hollendorfer was banned from all Stronach tracks, including Santa Anita and Golden Gate Fields. It was Hollendorfer's fourth death at Santa Anita, along with two at Golden Gate Fields. When Del Mar also barred Hollendorfer, he won the right to race there in court but then lost the same privilege at Golden Gate Fields in a different ruling. His status at Santa Anita is still under discussion, although currently he is banned.
Recently it was reported by the New York Times that Triple Crown winner Justify tested positive for a banned substance after winning the 2018 Santa Anita Derby. It was subsequently reported by the Los Angeles Times that Justify was one of seven horses that tested positive, indicating it was a feed contamination issue. Most veterinarians believe the banned drug, scopolamine, found in the feed is not a performance enhancer.
Still, the national spotlight remains on Southern California for this meet.
"There have been a lot of changes and what we did, we did at a time of crisis," Butler said. "It was done quickly. The luxury of time allows you to say maybe we were a little overzealous there or maybe we were a little under there. Now we think Round 2 we'll be even smarter about it."
Santa Anita has adjusted its safety and medication protocols to approximate those of Del Mar. The changes that occurred at Santa Anita have mostly been to regain public confidence.
Butler was installed as the new executive face of Santa Anita, and Craig Fravel, chief executive of the Breeders' Cup, will become the Stronach Group's chief executive of racing after the Nov. 1-2 event is held.
The dirt course was dug up and new drainage was put in, there is a new videoboard and the widely ignored "roulette" bet has been dumped. In addition, the 61/2-furlong downhill turf course will be closed this meeting.
The opening weekend is the best racing until the Breeders' Cup. There are two Grade 1 races for 2-year-olds Friday. The last five winners of the American Pharoah Stakes, formerly known as the FrontRunner, have run in the Kentucky Derby, two of them winning it -- American Pharoah and Nyquist.
The Awesome Again Stakes, headed by McKinzie, the top-rated horse in the country, will highlight Saturday. The race is a major prep for the Breeders' Cup Classic. Sunday is the Zenyatta Stakes, with the winner getting an automatic entry into the Breeders' Cup Distaff, the top race for fillies and mares.
Santa Anita is banking on the idea that its new slogan -- "Transforming Tradition" -- will remind people of racing's better times at the track.
"There is so much history here," Baffert said. "When you win a race here it means so much. This is the last of the tracks that has this kind of setting."

Texto completo: Readers cite both "The Godfather" and "The Simpsons" as they discuss the president's request for a Biden investigation.
To the Editor:
Re "Trump Asked for 'Favor' in Call, Memo Shows" (front page, Sept. 26):
I want to share two important points about impeachment:
1) There's no need for a quid pro quo. For the president simply to ask a foreign government to investigate his political rival is an impeachable offense. He's using his official authority to benefit himself personally. That's enough. Any quid pro quo is gravy, but is not necessary to prove.
2) Another reason a quid pro quo doesn't matter: Simply by making the request, the president has put himself and the country in jeopardy because now he is beholden to a foreign leader who can use the "favor" he has done as leverage against the president and the United States, whether as blackmail against the president or to extort something not in the United States' interest.
It's just like in "The Godfather": I do you a favor and someday I might ask a favor of you. Any president who puts himself in that position to benefit personally while putting himself and the country at risk should be impeached and removed from office.

To the Editor:
Over the past few weeks, I have explained to my political communication students the various deficits of American democracy. Now, as the press, at its finest, informs the public of a president's nefarious behavior, a whistle-blower courageously comes forth to reveal the chief executive's disturbing conversation, and the House of Representatives brandishes time-honored checks and balances, I will tell the class that for all its flaws, democracy in America remains intact, its institutions steering the country forward.

To the Editor:
So instead of releasing the entire transcript of his conversation with the president of Ukraine, President Trump releases a "memorandum" that may or may not have been edited before release to lessen its negative impact.
Will Congress step up to the plate and act with due diligence to ascertain whether anything was hidden by subpoenaing the note takers of the conversation, their notes, any recordings and the full transcript? Will Congress finally hold in contempt -- and insist on consequences for -- any administration official who refuses to cooperate with its subpoenas and thereby obstructs its investigation for the truth?
The American public deserves to know whether Attorney General William Barr and Mr. Trump are once again hiding important information from us.

To the Editor:
Re "Justice Dept.'s Response to Ukraine Call Prompts New Scrutiny of Barr" (news article, Sept. 26):
Although there are many serious allegations surrounding the Ukraine phone call and its ramifications, perhaps the most troubling aspect is the apparent "collusion" of the Justice Department and the Trump administration -- more specifically, Mr. Trump and Attorney General William Barr.
When justice and the law become the tools and the property of the president, when the highest law enforcement officer becomes his ally and legal protector, our survival as a democracy becomes threatened. Yes, a renewed scrutiny of Mr. Barr is imperative and warranted.

To the Editor:
In a famous "Simpsons" episode, Mr. Burns is told by his doctor that he is in excellent health. Not because he is disease-free, but to the contrary he has every disease known to man, and the result is that they are crowding one another out instead of infecting and killing him.
Donald Trump has a legal version of the Burns syndrome. There are so many scandals that they crowd one another out in the news so that nothing defeats him.
His strategy is now obvious. Rather than play it straight from here on out, he needs to gin up a new scandal every few days, because if one scandal, Ukraine for example, breaks through the noise then he is sunk; it will all come crashing down.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- President Trump's words about Marie L. Yovanovitch, his former ambassador to Ukraine, were ominous. In a telephone conversation that has set off a political crisis for Mr. Trump, he told Volodymyr Zelensky, the president of Ukraine, that she was "bad news."
"She's going to go through some things," he added.
In fact, she already has gone through quite a bit. Over the past several months, Ms. Yovanovitch, a decorated 33-year veteran of the State Department, has been vilified in the right-wing news media, denounced by the president's eldest son as a "joker," called a Democratic stooge by the president's personal lawyer and then abruptly recalled from Kiev this May, months ahead of schedule.
Her supposed sin, never backed up by evidence, was that she had shown disloyalty to Mr. Trump, disparaging him behind his back. Her friends, who say her professionalism and history of diplomatic service make that highly unlikely, have another theory: She had turned into collateral damage in efforts by Mr. Trump and Rudolph W. Giuliani, his personal lawyer, to damage the reputation of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., perhaps Mr. Trump's most prominent Democratic rival in 2020.
Among the apparent strikes against her: A former Ukrainian prosecutor claimed in an interview with The New York Times that Ms. Yovanovitch had blocked his team from getting visas to the United States to deliver damaging information about Mr. Biden and his son Hunter to the F.B.I.
In targeting Ms. Yovanovitch, former colleagues say, Mr. Trump and his allies underscored how profoundly suspicious they are of the career government professionals around them, leading the president to bypass the usual procedures and staff while outsourcing aspects of foreign policy to Mr. Giuliani and others.
Although largely unknown to the outside world, Ms. Yovanovitch has now become a sort of heroine to the State Department's career staff -- as well as a cautionary tale to many longtime American diplomats and national security officials. To them, she symbolizes an atmosphere in which dissenting, or even insisting on established procedures, can get them marked as outsiders, shut out of meetings, excluded from policymaking and in the end publicly hung out to dry as enemies of the administration.
At a news briefing on Thursday in New York, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo refused to answer questions shouted by reporters about why Ms. Yovanovitch had been suddenly recalled to Washington.
The American Academy of Diplomacy reacted by demanding that the State Department protect Ms. Yovanovitch from reprisals, calling the "threatening tone" of Mr. Trump's remarks about her "very troubling." The American Foreign Service Association, which represents State Department employees, urged that the American diplomatic corps "not be dragged into partisan political battles."
Now serving as a diplomat in residence at Georgetown University, Ms. Yovanovitch did not respond to requests for an interview.
While the abrupt end to her ambassadorship was widely seen as punitive, one former colleague said that it was possibly motivated by a genuine concern for her, and that State Department officials decided it was safer to bring her home.
Nonetheless, the level of suspicion and paranoia inside the foreign policy and national security agencies, already high since Mr. Trump's arrival, has only risen since Ms. Yovanovitch's saga has surfaced.
"It's more than crazy -- it's ugly, it's threatening," said Daniel Fried, a former ambassador and 40-year State Department official who has long dealt with Russian and Ukrainian issues and retired at the beginning of the Trump administration. "Masha Yovanovitch is known as a straight arrow, disciplined, professional."
"If you take out Masha Yovanovitch, you send the message to every ambassador that we will not have your back," he said.
Ms. Yovanovitch was born in Canada, moved to Connecticut at age 3 and became a naturalized American citizen at 18. In congressional testimony, she said her father fled the Soviet Union and then the Nazis; her mother grew up "stateless" in Germany. She said that background gave her a special empathy for those who had endured poverty, war and displacement.
She grew up speaking Russian, graduated from Princeton and joined the State Department six years later. Her specialty was Eurasia.
President George W. Bush appointed her ambassador to Kyrgyzstan, then to Armenia. President Barack Obama named her ambassador to Ukraine in 2016. There, she spoke out strongly against corruption in the Ukrainian government and pushed for a variety of reforms, including ending the immunity enjoyed by legislators accused of crimes.
John E. Herbst, a former ambassador to Ukraine, described her as a highly skilled and meticulous diplomat who would never share her personal political opinions with foreign officials -- or even with her diplomatic colleagues. She was careful not to overstep her authority, he said.
"Masha is someone who is always very attentive to propriety and to instructions, and by nature, cautious," he said. "She is uniformly held in high regard."
The campaign against her by Trump allies began more than a year ago, with a letter from Pete Sessions, a Texas Republican member of the House at the time who lost his re-election bid in November. He wrote to Mr. Pompeo that Ms. Yovanovitch should be fired for privately and repeatedly expressing "disdain" for the current administration.
Then, this spring, Joseph E. diGenova, a former federal prosecutor and an ally of Mr. Trump's, alleged on a Fox News broadcast that the ambassador had disparaged Mr. Trump to Ukrainian officials, telling them "not to listen to him or obey his policy because he was going to be impeached."
Two days later, Donald Trump Jr. posted a link on social media to a conservative website that described her as an anti-Trump Obama loyalist, and one Mr. Trump had been trying to fire for a year. He said his father's administration should have "less of these jokers as ambassadors."
About the same time, a Ukrainian-American named Lev Parnas, who has worked with Mr. Giuliani, told people in Republican circles in Washington of tape recordings of conversations in which Ms. Yovanovitch had supposedly disparaged the president, according to people he spoke with. The existence of those recordings has not been substantiated.
Her troubles mounted as Mr. Giuliani stepped up pressure on the Ukrainian government to open an investigation into whether Mr. Biden, as vice-president, had forced out a top prosecutor in order to shut down an inquiry that might have implicated Mr. Biden's son Hunter.
No evidence has emerged that Mr. Biden was actually trying to protect his son; in fact, many Western leaders viewed Ukraine's top prosecutor as corrupt and were pressuring Ukraine's leader to fire him.
But one former Ukrainian prosecutor, Kostiantyn H. Kulyk, told The New York Times in an interview in April that Ms. Yovanovitch had thwarted his efforts to meet with the F.B.I. to deliver damaging information about the Bidens by denying him a visa.
Mr. Giuliani also accused her of being a pawn of the New York financier George Soros, a major Democratic donor who backed a nonprofit anti-corruption group that worked in Ukraine. "The ambassador there is in the pocket of Soros," he said in a March interview with The New York Times.
The critiques of Ms. Yovanovitch clearly reached Mr. Trump's ears. In the July 25 phone call, Mr. Zelensky, Ukraine's newly elected president, told Mr. Trump: "You were the first one who told me that she was a bad ambassador," adding that "I agree with you 100 percent."
The premature end to Ms. Yovanovitch's tenure in Kiev was all the more remarkable because Ukraine's government had just turned over with the surprise election of Mr. Zelensky in April.
"She's capable and she's tough, and why would you want to lose your ambassador right at the moment when there is a big change in the government?" asked Evelyn Farkas, a former deputy assistant defense secretary for the region that includes Ukraine.
Mr. Trump has not yet chosen a replacement.

Bill Cohen, Republican who voted to impeach Nixon: What Trump is accused of doing would be 'impeachable'

Texto completo: A Maine Republican who voted to impeach Richard Nixon as a freshman House representative in 1974 said Thursday that trying to obtain damaging information on a political opponent from a foreign government while withholding military aid, as President Donald Trump is accused of doing, would be an impeachable offense.
William Cohen was one of seven Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee who voted to impeach Nixon while serving his first term after the Watergate scandal came before the committee in 1974.
On Thursday, as a whistleblower complaint circulated alleging Trump abused the power of his office to "solicit interference from a foreign country" in next year's presidential election, Cohen said in an email to the Bangor Daily News that while more evidence is to come, "I believe the effort to obtain damaging information from a foreign government on a potential presidential candidate and contemporaneously withholding needed military equipment would constitute an impeachable offense.
"Obviously, others may disagree and all should have the chance to publicly express their personal views on this serious subject," he wrote.
The comment comes two days after U.S. House Speaker Nancy Polosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry. The Senate voted unanimously Tuesday for the whistleblower complaint to be released to congressional intelligence committees. A declassified version of the complaint was released Thursday, and Joseph Maguire, the acting director of National Intelligence, was testifying before members of Congress after initially refusing to release the complaint. A memo of Trump's call to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky was also released Wednesday.
Cohen is one of Maine's most prominent politicians, having served as a U.S. House representative from 1973 to 1979, then as a U.S. senator from 1979 to 1997, when current Sen. Susan Collins -- who used to intern for Cohen -- took his place. He then served as the U.S. secretary of defense under former President Bill Clinton, a Democrat, from 1997 until 2001. Cohen now runs The Cohen Group, an international consulting and lobbying firm.
Maine politicians have had significant involvement in the three times Congress has started the impeachment process, but the Nixon impeachment effort was an early hurdle in Cohen's political career. He faced political pressure from his party and from Nixon himself.
He recalled on C-SPAN in 2014 a meeting with Nixon and fellow Republicans before the committee vote in which the president told members of his party that he "may be a son of a bitch, but I'm your son of a bitch."
Cohen said then that he was "preparing to lose" his seat over the vote based on the amount of hate mail his office received.
This is not the first time Cohen has weighed in on Trump. He told The New York Times earlier this year that he believed Republicans were wrong in backing Trump's refusal to cooperate with Congress and trying to shut down efforts to investigate whether the president obstructed justice.
"I am surprised there aren't more defenders of the Constitution," he told the Times in May. "They are there to be a check on abuse of power. If they are willing to submit that to the executive, then they have no business being in office."

Whistleblower identified as CIA officer who was detailed to White House

Texto completo: The whistleblower who filed a complaint alleging President Trump improperly leveraged military aid to encourage Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, is a Central Intelligence Agency officer, the New York Times reported Thursday.
The officer was detailed at the White House but has since returned to the CIA. His complaint became public earlier on Thursday, and it revealed, if accurate, that the White House officials "had intervened to 'lock down' all records of the phone call, especially the word-for-word transcript of the call."
The complaint did not contain firsthand accounts of the controversial phone call, only secondhand and thirdhand information.
“Any decision to report any perceived identifying information of the whistle-blower is deeply concerning and reckless, as it can place the individual in harm’s way,” Andrew Bakaj, the whistleblower's lead counsel, told the Times. “The whistle-blower has a right to anonymity.”
Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire testified in front of the House Intelligence Committee earlier in the day and addressed the need to keep the whistleblower's identity unknown.
“We must protect those who demonstrate the courage to report alleged wrongdoing, whether on the battlefield or in the workplace,” he said.
The CIA declined to comment for the Times' story.

Texto completo: Un agente de la CIA que laboró durante un tiempo en la Casa Blanca sería el informante que alertó sobre la petición del presidente Donald Trump a su homólogo ucraniano para investigar al exvicepresidente Joe Biden .
The New York Times afirma que corroboró la identidad de esa personas con tres fuentes distintas, además de señalar que es posible que el agente tenga un amplio conocimiento de la política ucraniana.
El denunciante presentó una queja que fue enviada al Comité de Inteligencia de la Cámara de Representantes para alegar un encubrimiento de la Casa Blanca de la llamada telefónica de julio en la que el presidente Trump solicitó al presidente ucraniano Volodymyr Zelensky que abriera una investigación sobre Hunter Biden , hijo del exvicepresidente aspirante a la candidatura presidencial de su partido.
El diario defiende la decisión de publicar la información sobre el denunciante, argumentando que el contexto de su posición y su experiencia le da credibilidad a su queja, sobre la cual este jueves compareció el director interino de Inteligencia Nacional, Joseph Maguire , quien dijo desconocer la identidad del informante.
La denuncia — que fue dada a conocer este jueves — advierte que la llamada del mandatario republicano al presidente ucraniano Zelensky también intentó ser ocultada por personal no identificado de la Casa Blanca.
“En el curso de mis deberes oficiales, he recibido información de varios funcionarios del gobierno de EEUU de que el presidente de los Estados Unidos está utilizando el poder de su oficina para solicitar la interferencia de un país extranjero (sic) en las elecciones estadounidenses de 2020” , escribió el denunciante en la queja con fecha del 12 de agosto sobre la llamada de julio. “Esta interferencia incluye, entre otras cosas, presionar a un país extranjero (sic) para que investigue a uno de los principales rivales políticos internos del presidente”.

Texto completo: In 1989, he defied the odds in bringing his crippled United Flight 232 in for a crash landing; more than 180 people survived.
Alfred Haynes, a pilot who led a United Airlines crew through an extraordinary display of improvised emergency flying that guided a crippled jet to a crash landing in Sioux City, Iowa, in 1989, saving more than 180 of the 296 people on board, died on Aug. 25 in Tacoma, Wash. He was 87.
His son Dan posted news of his death on Facebook.
Mr. Haynes was captain of United Flight 232 on July 19 when, a little more than an hour into its flight to Chicago from Denver, one of its three engines -- the one mounted in the tail -- exploded. What happened next has become part of aviation lore, an example of calm and quick thinking under the most extreme pressure.
"Most people know Chesley Sullenberger," said Spencer Bailey, a Flight 232 survivor, referring to the pilot who successfully landed a US Airways jet on the Hudson River in 2009, "but the feat Captain Haynes pulled off 30 years ago was truly a miracle, too."
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Mr. Haynes was piloting a DC-10, which would normally have been able to fly with only its two wing-mounted engines running. But Mr. Haynes; his first officer, William R. Records; and his second officer, Dudley J. Dvorak, quickly realized that they had almost no control over the aircraft. Debris from the explosion had severed the hydraulic lines that enabled the crew to steer the aircraft and control its speed. The plane was in danger of turning upside down.
"When the engine failed, the airplane started to turn to the right and started to roll," Mr. Haynes told CNN in 2013.
"If we had gotten upside down," he said, "the party was over."
But he and the crewmen found that they could level the aircraft by decreasing power to the left engine. A flight attendant remembered that Dennis Fitch, a DC-10 instructor at a United training center, was on board as a passenger. When she told him that the plane had lost all its hydraulics, he replied, "That's impossible."
Mr. Fitch joined the crew in the cockpit, and for the next 44 minutes the four men nursed the plane toward the nearest airport, in Sioux City, unable to turn the plane to the right, steering it by varying the speeds of the two functioning engines and fighting an up-and-down motion described in news accounts as "porpoising."
"Nothing in United's training would have prepared the pilot for something like this," John P. Ferg, a former director of flight operations for the airline, told The New York Times at the time. "By all laws of airmanship, he shouldn't have gotten that close to the runway."
Without the standard tools for slowing and steering the plane, Mr. Haynes approached Runway 22 of Sioux Gateway Airport going much too fast and descending at a much steeper angle than what was normal for a landing. As the plane tried to touch down, the right wing clipped the ground and the aircraft broke apart amid smoke and flame.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Investigators determined that the plane's troubles had begun when a cracked fan disc disintegrated. The crash caused the cockpit "to break off like a pencil tip," Mr. Fitch later told Popular Mechanics magazine. Mr. Haynes's fellow crewmen also survived.
Mr. Haynes would often say in later years that his thoughts were with those who did not survive -- 111 that day and another a month later.
"It was very hard to get past the guilt of surviving," he told New York magazine in 2009. "My job had been to get people from point A to point B safely, and I didn't do it. I felt that I had killed them."
Because of a promotion the airline was running, there were numerous children on the flight. One was Mr. Bailey, who was 3 at the time and today is a journalist and host, with Andrew Zuckerman, of the podcast Time Sensitive. He remembers nothing of the crash but learned about the efforts of the crew in later years.
"I would not be here, alive and typing this sentence, were it not for the actions of Captain Haynes and those who were in the cockpit with him," he said by email.
His mother, Frances, died in the crash, but his older brother Brandon survived.
"Brandon and I both know that day will always remain a part of us, but our lives continue onward, growing far beyond it," Mr. Bailey said. "And for this fact, that we lived on and were able to grow up past July 19, 1989, we largely have Captain Haynes to thank."
Alfred Clair Haynes was born on Aug. 31, 1931, in Paris, Tex., and grew up in Dallas. After three years at Texas A&M University, he joined the Naval Aviation Cadet Training Program in 1952. He was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Marine Corps, later became a first lieutenant and ended his military career in 1956 as an instructor pilot.
He joined United that year as a flight engineer, became a first officer in 1963 and was promoted to captain in 1985. By the time of the fateful flight, he had almost 30,000 hours of total flight time, including more than 7,000 hours in a DC-10.
Mr. Haynes, though injured, was flying again within a few months. The accident has been the subject of several books as well as a 1992 television movie, "Crash Landing: The Rescue of Flight 232." Charlton Heston played Mr. Haynes.
After the crash, the National Transportation Safety Board programmed the conditions faced by the United 232 crew into a flight simulator to see if anything could be gleaned that could be incorporated into pilot training. It found, basically, that what Mr. Haynes and his crew had accomplished defied too many odds to be reduced to a pat lesson.
The crew's performance, the board said in a report, had "greatly exceeded reasonable expectations."
Along with his son Dan and several grandchildren, Mr. Haynes's survivors include his daughter, Laurie Arguello. In 2003, Mr. Haynes appealed for donations to help her pay for a lifesaving bone marrow transplant. His son Tony died in a motorcycle accident in 1996. His wife, Darlene, died not long after.
Mr. Haynes gave countless speeches about his Flight 232 experience.
"I tell people it's about luck, communications, preparation, execution and cooperation," he told The Sioux City Journal in 2010. "You can apply that to any business and to your life."
When he wasn't flying, Mr. Haynes umpired Little League games, including during the 1978 Little League World Series in Williamsport, Pa.
"If he weren't an airline pilot, he could be a professional umpire," Jim Chavez, a Little League district administrator, said in 1989, when Mr. Haynes was in the news because of the crash. "He knows the book. When Al calls a strike, you know it's a strike."
On Dan Haynes's Facebook page, the many tributes to his father were as apt to mention the umpiring as they were the heroics.
"A legend in aviation for sure," one reads, "but he was so much more. I'll never forget seeing him at the Little League regionals in San Bernardino, where he was the master of ceremonies. He gave a great speech in front of thousands, and then went into a booth behind the outfield, put an apron on, and started selling corn on the cob to raise $ for LL."

A tail engine had exploded, and his calm and quick thinking saved the lives of more than 180 on board. Above, the wreckage being moved in 1998.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced Tuesday that the House would initiate a formal impeachment inquiry against President Trump, accusing him of betraying his oath of office and the nation's security by seeking to enlist a foreign power to tarnish a rival for his own political gain.
Pelosi's declaration, after months of reticence by Democrats who had feared the political consequences of impeaching a president many of them long ago concluded was unfit for office, was a stunning turn that set the stage for a history-making and exceedingly bitter confrontation between the Democrat-led House and a defiant president who has thumbed his nose at institutional norms.
“The actions taken to date by the president have seriously violated the Constitution," Pelosi said in a brief speech invoking the nation's founding principles. Trump, she added, “must be held accountable — no one is above the law."
She said the president's conduct revealed his “betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security, and betrayal of the integrity of our elections."
Pelosi's decision to plow forward with the most severe action that Congress can take against a sitting president could usher in a remarkable new chapter in American life, touching off a constitutional and political showdown with the potential to cleave an already divided nation, reshape Trump's presidency and the country's politics, and carry heavy risks both for him and for the Democrats.
It also raised the possibility that Trump could become only the fourth president in US history to face impeachment. Presidents Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton were both impeached but later acquitted by the Senate. President Richard Nixon resigned in the face of a looming House impeachment vote.
It was the first salvo in an escalating, high-stakes standoff between Pelosi and Trump, who angrily denounced Democrats' impeachment inquiry even as he worked feverishly in private to head off the risk to his presidency.
Trump, who for months has dared Democrats to impeach him, issued a defiant response on Twitter while in New York for several days of international diplomacy at the United Nations, with a series of fuming posts that culminated with a simple phrase: “PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!" Meanwhile, his reelection campaign and House Republicans launched a vociferous defense, accusing Democrats of a partisan rush to judgment.
“Such an important day at the United Nations, so much work and so much success, and the Democrats purposely had to ruin and demean it with more breaking news Witch Hunt garbage," Trump wrote. “So bad for our Country!
For the past two years, talk of impeachment had centered around the findings of the special counsel, Robert Mueller, who investigated Russia's interference in the 2016 elections and Trump's attempts to derail that inquiry. On Tuesday, Pelosi, Democrat of California, told her caucus and then the country that new revelations about Trump's dealings with Ukraine, and his administration's stonewalling of Congress about them, had finally left the House no choice.
At issue are allegations that Trump pressured the president of Ukraine to open a corruption investigation of former vice president Joe Biden, a leading contender for the Democratic presidential nomination, and his son. The conversation is said to be part of a whistle-blower complaint that the Trump administration has withheld from Congress. And it occurred just a few days after Trump had ordered his staff to freeze more than $391 million in aid to Ukraine.
Trump said Tuesday that he would authorize the release of a transcript of the conversation, part of an effort to preempt Democrats' impeachment push. But Democrats were unbowed, demanding the full whistle-blower complaint and other documentation about White House dealings with Ukraine.
Pelosi told fellow Democrats that in a private call initiated by Trump on Tuesday morning, the president said that he was not responsible for withholding the whistle-blower complaint from Congress, Democrats said.
House Democrats plan to bring up a resolution Wednesday condemning Trump's reported behavior toward Ukraine and demanding he release the whistle-blower complaint — daring Republicans to vote against it.
Pelosi said she had directed the chairmen of the six committees that have been investigating Trump to “proceed under that umbrella of impeachment inquiry." In a closed-door meeting earlier in the day, she said the panels should put together their best cases on potentially impeachable offenses by the president and send them to the Judiciary Committee, according to two officials familiar with the conversation.
But whether Democrats would hold another House vote in the coming days to authorize their inquiry — as has been done in past presidential impeachments — remains to be seen. Republicans argue that without one, the House is not truly in an impeachment inquiry, no matter what Democrats say. Nor did the speaker lay out a timeline for the committees to do their work.
The decision to begin a formal impeachment inquiry does not necessarily mean that the House will ultimately vote to charge Trump with high crimes and misdemeanors — much less that the Republican-controlled Senate will vote to remove him. But Pelosi and her leadership would not initiate the process unless they were prepared to reach that outcome.
Meanwhile, in Wilmington, Del., on Tuesday, Biden called the president's actions an “abuse of power" that undermined national security, and said he would support impeachment if Trump did not provide information related to congressional investigations.
The House Judiciary Committee has been conducting its own impeachment investigation focused on Mueller's findings, as well as allegations that Trump may be illegally profiting from spending by state and foreign governments and other matters. But that inquiry had not gotten the imprimatur of a full House vote or the full rhetorical backing of the speaker.
The developments that have turned the tide began less than two weeks ago, when Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the Intelligence Committee chairman, first revealed the existence of a secret whistle-blower complaint that the intelligence community's internal watchdog had deemed “urgent" and credible but that the Trump administration had refused to share with Congress.
Democrats have given Joseph Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence, until Thursday to turn over the whistle-blower complaint or risk reprisal. And they have threatened to subpoena the Trump administration for a copy of the transcript of the president's call with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy of Ukraine and other relevant documents after Thursday if they are not shared voluntarily.
Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, declined to say Tuesday what he would do if the House voted for impeachment. However, he did issue a statement, saying Pelosi's "efforts to restrain her far-left conference have finally crumbled."

Texto completo: U.S. Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler
R-Battle Ground
President Donald Trump directed the acting White House chief of staff to freeze more than $391 million in aid to Ukraine in the days before a scheduled phone call with the new Ukrainian president, a conversation in which Trump insinuated that the Ukraine should investigate the family of Democratic presidential front-runner Joseph Biden, the former vice president.
Trump has denied any wrongdoing, and he agreed to release the transcript of the call to the public today. His administration paid the Ukrainian aid under pressure from Congress after news of the freeze leaked through media reports.
The July 25 conversation is said to be part of a whistleblower complaint that became known to the House Intelligence Committee two weeks ago. The intelligence community's internal watchdog has deemed the whistleblower complaint “urgent” and credible, but the Trump administration has so far refused to share the document with Congress, The New York Times reported. House Democrats have threatened to issue a subpoena for the whistleblower complaint if it's not released by Thursday.
The Columbian sent Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler, R-Battle Ground, a list of questions to clarify her position on Congress' role as it relates to these events. Her answers, in full, are as follows:
Do you believe that this information that we have so far merits further investigation from Congress?
“There are serious allegations here that deserve a finding of all the facts. The president has said he acted appropriately, and I support his decision to release the call transcript and be transparent about what took place. He should do so as soon as practicable.”
Do you think House members should be able to compel the administration to turn over a transcript of the president's July 25 conversation with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky?
“The president has said he will release the transcript. I support that action, and hope he provides this transparency as soon as practicable.”
Do you believe House members should be able to compel the administration to turn over a copy of the whistleblower complaint connected to that call?
“We need the transparency of seeing the transcript of what took place on that call which will dictate what, if any, action is needed from Congress. Leaders from the House Intelligence Committee are already planning to speak with the whistleblower about taking his testimony.”
Do you believe Congress can conduct a full and fair investigation of these events without either of these documents?
“We need the transparency of seeing the transcript of what took place on that call which will dictate what, if any, action is needed from Congress. Leaders from the House Intelligence Committee are already planning to speak with the whistleblower about taking his testimony.”
Do you think the administration should hand over these documents?
“I believe the president made the appropriate decision to release the transcript. There are serious allegations involved, and the public deserves transparency and to have all of the facts. The need for other documents will be determined by the contents of the transcript and/or the testimony of the whistleblower.”
Do you think the administration should have to?
“We need to be careful about the precedent we set by requiring presidents to release their confidential conversations with world leaders unless there's an extremely compelling reason to do so, but in this case the president has already agreed to release the transcript and provide transparency to the public.”
If the administration were to refuse to hand over either of these documents to you and your colleagues, what should the recourse of Congress be?
“We'll start by reviewing the transcript, and the appropriate committees should take action as warranted if additional transparency is needed, whether that's hearings, further investigation, or a determination that no more action is required based on the facts.”
Say Thursday comes and goes and Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire fails to turn over the whistleblower complaint, disregarding the deadline set by your colleagues. What action would you support?
“Again, the public deserves complete transparency with regard to what took place on that call which will dictate what, if any, action is needed from Congress. Leaders from the House Intelligence Committee are already planning to speak with the whistleblower about taking his testimony.”
Do you support the impeachment proceedings announced by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi today?
“It's premature to make a judgment on impeachment before anyone has even seen the transcript of the president's conversation or the whistleblower documents. The president has said he will release both, and I welcome his transparency on this issue.”
(Reporter's note: As of 5 p.m. Tuesday, The New York Times reported that 197 members of the U.S. House of Representatives — 196 Democrats and one independent — supported launching impeachment proceedings.)

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Republicans appear to be sticking by President Donald Trump despite concerns he sought foreign help to discredit Democratic opponent Joe Biden.
The latest controversy riling up the White House revolves around Trump's contacts with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, a whistleblower complaint at a U.S. intelligence agency and whether Trump conditioned the granting military aid to Ukraine on an investigation into the former Vice President's son, Hunter Biden.
Trump has acknowledged bringing up Biden, the former vice president and leading Democratic 2020 presidential contender, in a July phone call with Zelensky, but he denied offering the aid in exchange for an investigation into Biden.
"I didn't do it," Trump told reporters on Monday in New York at the United Nations General Assembly.
Many Senate Republicans on Monday resisted saying too much about the controversy, dodging questions by reporters and stressing that none of the information about the complaint or the president's conversations has been verified. But others downplayed the issue, saying this was another attempt by Democrats to amplify impeachment efforts. Some also repeated comments that the president himself has made that Biden should be investigated and that's what the media should be focusing on.
Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin met with Zelensky in Ukraine earlier this month and said before his visit, he talked with Trump on the phone. Johnson said he hoped he could convince Trump to approve of the aid so he could relay that message in person to Zelensky. Trump declined.
"The rationale that he gave [me] is the concern about corruption in Ukraine, which is what I relayed to President Zelensky, and they all acknowledge it. It's why he won the election. They're trying to rid the country of corruption," Johnson said, adding Trump "did not mention anything about Joe Biden or anything" during their phone call.
Johnson said he didn't believe the whistleblower complaint should be made available to Congress, nor should a transcript of Trump's call with Zelensky. "It's a very dangerous precedent" to start, he said of releasing the call and said it does not appear the complaint is "something necessarily has to have."
Sen. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blamed Democrats for choosing to "politicize this issue." He said their actions are "circumventing the established procedures and protocols that exist so the committees can pursue sensitive matters in the appropriate, deliberate, bipartisan manner."
"What I really see happening is that Democrats are winding up the outrage machine again," said Sen. John Barrasso, the third highest-ranking Republican in the Senate, adding it's all about "beating the impeachment drum."
"They didn't get what they wanted out of the Mueller investigation," said Barrasso, R-Wyo. "They're hoping they have something here. I just don't see it."
McConnell also noted that he personally talked with the Secretary of Defense and Secretary of State to "ensure that Ukraine received this much-needed assistance."
Republicans were divided over whether those materials should be made available to Congress.
Several Republicans expressed unease with the reports about Trump's conversation with Zelensky and stressed the need for more information. Utah Republican Sen. Mitt Romney said it would be "very serious" if Trump demanded an investigation into Biden and stressed that Congress needs more information on what happened.
Sen. Susan Murkowski, R-Alaska, also said while there aren't facts showing Trump requested an investigation into Biden in exchange for the aid, "it's not OK to make a request that's a quid-pro-quo." She said it would be "helpful" having a transcript of the president's call and more information on the whistleblower complaint from the inspector general of the intelligence community.
Both the acting Director of National Intelligence, Joseph Maguire, and the inspector general Michael Atkinson could appear this week before the Senate Intelligence Committee.
Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., echoed concerns of president and his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, that Biden's conduct should be looked into.
"I think one, we have to get more information about what the President said. And also, we have to get an understanding of exactly what Biden did," Scott said.
The New York Times reported in May that Biden, while in office in 2016, threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees unless Ukraine reduced its corruption. Part of that demand called for removing the country's top prosecutor, who was investigating the oligarch behind an energy company where Hunter Biden served on the board.
The prosecutor was accused by U.S. officials of ignoring corruption in his own office. The Ukrainian Parliament eventually voted him out. But Yuriy Lutsenko, Ukraine's current prosecutor, told Bloomberg News Service in May that he had no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden or his son.

Texto completo: Ms. Gabbard earned 2 percent support in a new poll in New Hampshire, enough to secure a spot on the stage in Ohio next month.
Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii became the 12th Democratic presidential candidate to qualify for the October debate after a poll released on Tuesday showed her with 2 percent support in New Hampshire.
In order to earn a spot on the stage in Ohio next month, candidates must procure donations from 130,000 people and earn at least 2 percent support in four qualifying polls. Ms. Gabbard passed the donor threshold in early August but is only now getting her fourth qualifying poll, a week before the Oct. 1 deadline set by the Democratic National Committee.
Thanks to her standing in the poll released Tuesday, a Monmouth University survey of New Hampshire voters likely to participate in the Democratic presidential primary, Ms. Gabbard will be invited to join the 10 candidates who participated in the September debate, along with Tom Steyer, the billionaire and former hedge fund investor, who has also qualified. The debate will be held at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio, on Oct. 15 and possibly Oct. 16, and will be hosted by CNN and The New York Times.
It is not yet clear whether the debate will take place over two nights, but Ms. Gabbard's inclusion adds to that possibility. The June and July debates featured 20 candidates evenly split over two-night events; after the D.N.C. tightened its qualification requirements for the fall, the debate this month was held with 10 candidates on a single evening.
Even as Ms. Gabbard qualified for the October debate on Tuesday, other campaigns were already looking ahead to the following debate, scheduled for November.
The Monmouth poll enabled five candidates to punch their tickets for the November debate, according to an analysis by The Times: former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Senator Kamala Harris of California and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind.
To be included in the November debate, candidates must receive donations from at least 165,000 people and must meet one of two polling requirements: They must receive either 3 percent support in four qualifying national or early-state polls, or 5 percent support in two polls in the four early-voting states -- Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. The five candidates who qualified for the November debate have all passed the donor threshold and met the polling standard with the release of Tuesday's New Hampshire poll.
The date and location of the November debate have not been announced.
Ms. Gabbard, 38, who was a soldier in Iraq and currently serves as a major in the Hawaii Army National Guard, has made getting out of foreign wars her central campaign promise and is likely to reiterate her message in front of the national television audience that the October debates will provide.
For weeks, Ms. Gabbard was just a few polls short of making the fall debates, and as it became clear she would not be allowed to participate in the September event, her campaign began to publicly question the D.N.C.'s qualification criteria. Like some of her rivals for the nomination, Ms. Gabbard has earned 2 percent support or higher in several polls that the D.N.C. does not count toward debate qualification, and her campaign has argued vociferously that some of them should.
The Monmouth poll released Tuesday showed Ms. Warren and Mr. Biden atop the Democratic field in New Hampshire: Ms. Warren had 27 support, and Mr. Biden had 25 percent. Mr. Sanders finished third with 12 percent, followed by Mr. Buttigieg with 10 percent. Ms. Harris finished fifth with 3 percent support.
The poll of 401 registered New Hampshire Democrats and unaffiliated voters who are likely to participate in the 2020 Democratic primary had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus five percentage points. The poll was conducted by telephone Sept. 17-21, a few days after the last Democratic debate.
A Monmouth poll of New Hampshire voters conducted in May had Mr. Biden far ahead with 36 percent support. In that poll, Mr. Sanders finished second with 18 percent and Ms. Warren finished fourth, behind Mr. Buttigieg, with 8 percent support.
A CBS/YouGov poll of registered Democrats in New Hampshire released earlier this month showed Ms. Warren, Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders locked in a statistical dead heat, each with the support of about one in four respondents.
Besides Ms. Gabbard, Mr. Steyer and the five top-polling candidates, the other contenders set to debate in October are Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, the former housing secretary Julián Castro, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, former Representative Beto O'Rourke of Texas and the entrepreneur Andrew Yang.

Dean &amp; DeLuca Store Closes

Texto completo: As the company falters, only its flagship shop in SoHo remains open in New York.
After months of rumors, sinking morale and shrinking inventory, the Dean & DeLuca store in Midtown has closed.
A sign in the window at 620 Eighth Avenue, on the ground floor of The New York Times building, made it official on Tuesday: "It is with deep regret that we announce the closing of this location. We have been a proud part of this neighborhood and building for over 10 years. From all of the Dean & DeLuca team, we thank you for all the years of support you've given us."
The flagship store in SoHo, which opened in 1977 and helped introduce its Manhattan shoppers to gastronomic luxury and unusual specialties, was still open.
But it was nearly empty. In baskets that once brimmed with fresh, rare produce, there were only a handful of kiwis. On shelves once full of boutique sodas and premade salads, employees were unloading Coca-Cola and LaCroix from boxes. If not for the Dean & DeLuca branded merchandise -- aprons, salts, tote bags -- it might well have been any other bodega in the city.
Signs taped to columns said the company was preparing for renovations. Employees would not comment, and said the manager was not there.
Dean & DeLuca, owned by a Thai real estate magnate, has been closing stores all summer, amid mounting debts and complaints from suppliers that they had not been paid. When The New York Times first reported the closings in July, the company said it would shut three stores. Four more closed in August.
In addition to the SoHo store, the company website lists two locations in Hawaii, but neither had opened for the day at the time of publication.
When Pace Development, a company whose chief executive is Sorapoj Techakraisri, the scion of a wealthy real estate family, bought Dean & DeLuca in 2014, there were 40 locations.
In early August, The Nation, an English language publication in Bangkok, reported that Mr. Sorapoj planned to expand the chain through Asia, adding around 90 more stores in Thailand and outposts in five more Asian capitals. For the American stores, he said, "we are adjusting the Dean & DeLuca business to a more appropriate size by controlling expenditures both at its office and stores."
Asked for comment, a spokeswoman for Dean & DeLuca said Tuesday that she had reached out to Mr. Sorapoj but not received a reply.
Although Mr. Sorapoj told The Times, through a representative, in July that current employees would be paid, paychecks have been repeatedly delayed. After the Midtown store closed without warning one day this month, some employees said they had not come in because they had not been paid.

Texto completo: Once upon a time, there was an ideal. It was called the United States of America.
And in 2016, the presidency of the United States was captured by the flamboyantly incompetent star of a TV reality show, a man who doesn't believe in any ideal beyond his own enrichment and aggrandizement. Some shaken observers assured us everything would yet be all right. The institutions of democracy -- the courts, the Congress, the news media and the agencies of the federal government -- would save America from the worst consequences of one of its worst decisions.
"The Guardrails Hold," exulted the headline of a piece by the late conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer. He was highlighting acts of resistance to Donald Trump's bizarre excesses by entities as varied as the Boy Scouts of America and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
That was in August of 2017. It has since become painfully clear Krauthammer exulted too soon. The vaunted institutions of democracy have proven largely unequal to the task of checking Trump's transgressions.
The courts? The record is mixed; Trump's bid to rig the Census was rejected, his Muslim ban was not.
The Congress? A hotbed of spinelessness that has given Trump less trouble than the Washington Generals give the Harlem Globetrotters.
The news media? Aggressive reporting is met with widespread apathy and partisan claims of "fake news." The New York Times reported that Trump committed "outright fraud" as a businessman. Nobody cared.
Which brings us to federal agencies and last week's news that the acting director of national intelligence is apparently shielding Trump from questioning over allegations of still-unrevealed misconduct. It seems Trump, who has a history of cavalier behavior with classified information -- he once blurted intelligence secrets to Russians in the Oval Office -- had an interaction with a foreign leader wherein he made an unspecified "promise" that so troubled one official it led to the filing of a formal whistleblower complaint.
As first reported by The Washington Post, Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson found the complaint credible and designated it a matter of "urgent concern." That's a legal finding requiring notification of congressional oversight committees. But acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire has refused to provide that information to lawmakers.
It's important to note the context here.
Earlier this month, the Justice Department launched an antitrust investigation of four automakers after they reached agreement with the state of California to maintain higher fuel-efficiency standards than the federal government requires. It can be no coincidence that Trump has long been at war with that state.
At roughly the same time, officials at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reportedly were threatened with termination for contradicting Trump's claim -- he tried to prove it by marking a map with a Sharpie -- that Alabama was menaced by a killer storm.
Now here's the acting DNI throwing his body between Trump and accountability. We are seeing the credibility of the federal government mangled in service to this guy's fragile ego. How weak the guardrails of democracy turn out to be. Even this one -- a government of, by and for the people is looking suspiciously like a government of, by and for Trump.
But where guardrails fail, things crash and fall apart. Something to remember as we wait out the long years until next November.
We were told our institutions would save us. They'll be lucky if they can save themselves.

New York Times accuses Trump administration of failing to block arrest of reporter in Egypt

Texto completo: The publisher of the New York Times has claimed that the Trump administration planned to let a reporter get arrested in Egypt.
A.G. Sulzberger made the claim Monday during a talk at Brown University, and his remarks were later published in his newspaper's opinion section.
"Two years ago, we got a call from a United States government official warning us of the imminent arrest of a New York Times reporter based in Egypt named Declan Walsh," he said. "Though the news was alarming, the call was actually fairly standard. Over the years, we’ve received countless such warnings from American diplomats, military leaders, and national security officials."
"Unable to count on our own government to prevent the arrest or help free Declan if he were imprisoned, we turned to his native country, Ireland, for help," Sulzberger continued, adding that Irish officials got him to the airport before he could be arrested.
The 39-year-old publisher also cited a February 2019 incident in which the newspaper's David Kirkpatrick was detained in Egypt and deported in "apparent retaliation" for reporting information embarrassing to the Egyptian government.
"A senior official at the United States Embassy in Cairo openly voiced the cynical worldview behind the Trump administration’s tolerance for such crackdowns. 'What did you expect would happen to him?'" he said. "'His reporting made the government look bad,'" Sulzberger stated.
The rest of Sulzberger's talk focused on the threats journalists face around the world and how Trump had played a role in the shift.

Texto completo: Given how much it’s talked, tweeted about and worried over, you’d think we’d know a lot about fake news. And in some sense, we do. We know that false stories posing as legitimate journalism have been used to try to sway elections; we know they help spread conspiracy theories; they may even cause false memories. And yet we also know that the term “fake news” has become a trope, so widely used and abused that it no longer serves its original function.
Why is that? And why, given all our supposed knowledge of it, is fake news — the actual phenomenon — still effective? Reflection on our emotions, together with a little help from contemporary philosophy of language and neuroscience, suggests an answer to both questions.
We are often confused about the role that emotion plays in our lives. For one thing, we like to think, with Plato, that reason drives the chariot of our mind and keeps the unruly wild horses of emotion in line. But most people would probably admit that much of the time, Hume was closer to the truth when he said that reason is the slave of the passions. Moreover, we often confuse our feelings with reality itself: Something makes us feel bad, and so we say it is bad.
As a result, our everyday acts of communication can function as vehicles for emotion without our noticing it. This was a point highlighted by mid-20th century philosophers of language often called “expressivists.” Their point was that people sometimes think they are talking about facts when they are really expressing themselves emotionally. The expressivists applied this thought quite widely to all ethical communication about right or wrong, good or bad. But even if we don’t go that far, their insight says something about what is going on when we share or retweet news posts — fake or otherwise — online.
When sharing or retweeting, we like to think of ourselves as engaging in what philosophers would call an act of testimony — trying to convey or endorse knowledge. Not always, of course; happily, irony still exists. Yet insincere sharing or retweeting is not the norm — as evidenced by the fact that most people feel obligated to signal that retweets aren’t endorsements. That wouldn’t make sense if the default wasn’t that shares and retweets are endorsements.
But what if we are just confused about the way communication actually functions online? Clues can be found in both what we do and don’t do when sharing content online.
Let’s start with what we don’t do. Current research estimates that at least 60 percent of news stories shared online have not even been read by the person sharing them. As an author of one study summed up the matter, “People are more willing to share an article than read it.” On the other hand, what we do is share content that gets people riled up. Research has found that the best predictor of sharing is strong emotions — both emotions like affection (think posts about cute kittens) and emotions like moral outrage. Studies suggest that morally laden emotions are particularly effective: every moral sentiment in a tweet increases by 20 percent its chances of being shared. And social media may just pump up our feelings. Acts that don’t elicit as much outrage offline, for example, elicit more online, perhaps because the social benefits of outrage still exist without the normal risks.
This should tell us that conveying knowledge isn’t the primary reason news stories are shared. As the influential contemporary philosopher Ruth Millikan puts it, the stabilizing function of a communicative act is whatever explains why that act continues to persist. The stabilizing function of yelling “Air ball!” at a basketball player trying to make a free throw is to distract him. It may do other things too — amuse people, or even describe what, in fact, turns out to be an air ball. But the reason people continue to yell “Air ball!” it is that it is distracting. Someone new to the game could conceivably get this backward. They might think that people are warning the player or predicting how the shot is going to fall. Such interpretations would be a misunderstanding the act’s stabilizing function.
Something like this is happening on a massive scale on social media. We are like the person just described, new to the game of basketball. We think we are sharing news stories in order to do one thing, like transfer knowledge, but much of the time aren’t really trying to do that at all — whatever we may consciously think. If we were, we would presumably have read the piece that we’re sharing. But most of us don’t. So, what are we doing?
I think it is plausible that the stabilizing function of the practice of sharing content online is to express our emotions. In particular, when it comes to sharing political news stories, we often are signaling our outrage and thereby hoping that others will share it. That’s one way that tribes are built and social norms enforced. Social media is an outrage factory. And paradoxically, it works because most folks aren’t aware, or don’t want to be aware, of this point.
Yet it is just this lack of awareness that trolls and other workers in the misinformation industrial complex find so useful. Purveyors of deliberate but disguised falsehoods are keenly aware that when we share, we’re doing something different from what we think we’re doing. Our confusion is what makes us such easy marks.
The expressivists’ insight also nicely explains why the term “fake news” itself has changed its use. It has become a vehicle for expressing our hostility, similar to yelling “boo” at a sports game. That’s an irony all too representative of our age of absurdity. Even our attempts to distinguish truth from falsity turn into screams of outrage.

Mullis guilty of wife's murder

Texto completo: BY ERIK HOGSTROM

A jury on Monday found an Earlville, Iowa, hog farmer guilty of murdering his wife with a corn rake.
Todd M. Mullis, 43, flanked by his attorneys, grimaced and shook his head slightly as the verdict was read on the sixth day of his first-degree murder trial at the Dubuque County Courthouse. The 12-person jury deliberated for about 7½ hours over Friday and Monday before returning the verdict.
In Iowa, a conviction of first-degree murder brings an automatic sentence of life in prison without parole.
Mullis killed his wife, Amy Mullis, with a corn rake on Nov. 10, then tried to make it look like an accident. Prosecutors said he was enraged over her latest affair.
Amy Mullis' family members hugged each other and some were in tears when Iowa District Judge Thomas Bitter read the verdict.
"We aren't going to have any comments," said Jeff Fuller, of Eldora, Iowa, as the courtroom was clearing afterward.
Tears streamed down his face.
Fuller is Amy Mullis' brother and testified on the first day of testimony in the trial.
The prosecution was led by Delaware County's county attorney, John Bernau, and Iowa Assistant Attorney General Maureen Hughes.
"I'm happy for the family and maybe I'll have more for you after sentencing," Bernau said when asked to comment after the verdict was read.
Hughes said in the prosecution's closing argument that Todd Mullis had been considering killing his wife for years. She said he waited for Amy Mullis to undergo a medical procedure as a way of providing an excuse for why she would fall on a corn rake.
The defense argued that someone else killed Amy Mullis on that morning while Todd Mullis and his son worked in a nearby barn.
Defense attorney Gerald "Jake" Feuerhelm said he was disappointed with the verdict and that his client would appeal.
"We'll sort things out and talk to Todd about that and go from there," Feuerhelm said.
Feuerhelm said it was too early to assess the defense's prospects with that appeal.
"Obviously, you go through your notes and look at all the witnesses and make a determination about court rulings and the whole gamut of how the trial rolled out," he said.
Todd Mullis remained silent in the aftermath of the verdict. He looked at several of his family members in the gallery as bailiffs shackled him in chains. Defense attorneys stared down at the tabletop in front of them.
Mullis' attorneys successfully petitioned for the trial to be moved from Delaware County due to pretrial publicity.
The trial started Sept. 16 with jury selection in Dubuque and immediately attracted national attention. Court TV showed the trial live, while stories of the proceedings were shared by outlets such as The New York Times and Washington Post.
Opening statements were delivered on Sept. 17, with both sides acknowledging that Amy Mullis had been killed but disagreeing on whether Todd Mullis was responsible.
The couple's 14-year-old son also testified that day. He was with his mom and dad that morning when they were working in a hog barn on the family's farm. Todd Mullis said his wife was dizzy from a recent medical procedure, so she stopped doing tasks in the barn and went to retrieve a pet carrier from a nearby shed at his request.
Todd Mullis later asked his son to check on Amy Mullis. The teen found her impaled by the corn rake.
During a deposition, the teen reported that his dad only was out of his sight for one minute, 40 seconds. During his testimony last week, though, he admitted that time estimate was inaccurate.
On Thursday afternoon and Friday morning, Todd Mullis took the stand. He answered questions about Google searches performed on his iPad for phrases such as "killing unfaithful women," "what happened to cheating spouses in historic Aztec tribes." "was killing more accepted centuries ago" and "did ancient cultures kill adulterers." He denied performing any searches about cheating spouses.
The jury deliberated for about two and a half hours Friday before being excused for the weekend. Deliberations resumed at 9a.m. and briefly halted around lunch, when jurors submitted a written question to Iowa District Judge Thomas Bitter at 11:50a.m.
The jurors asked for a definition of "UTC time" and if the times of internet searches listed on Google records submitted as state's evidence reflected Iowa's time zone. The searches were done on Todd Mullis' iPad.
The defense had argued that UTC time is the successor of Greenwich Mean Time, so that searches on the Google list that appeared to have been made in the early morning hours -
Often before 3a.m. - actually were performed in the early evenings because of the time difference between Central Time and UTC.
Bitter's written response to the jury was that no additional evidence would be presented.
Deliberations then continued until around 2p.m., when the court attendant was alerted to the jury reaching the verdict.
Family members and other spectators gathered in the north courtroom as attorneys took their position at their respective tables.
Todd Mullis was led in by a bailiff, and Bitter cautioned the gallery against any outbursts.
"This is an emotional case on both sides," he said. "I expect no disruption of any kind. I want this proceeding to go smoothly."
A sentencing hearing has not been set yet.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Former FBI director James Comey said in a radio interview Tuesday that he hopes President Donald Trump is not impeached because it means American voters would be “let off the hook. ”
Comey was fired by the Trump in 2017 and has since been a staunch critic of the president, but reiterated his view that removing Trump from office before his tenure is completed is the wrong move.
When asked about impeaching Trump, Comey answered that “as a citizen, I hope not because I think the American people would be let off the hook. "
“A lot of his supporters would think some kind of coup had taken place," Comey said during the interview with California radio station KCRA. "We need to take responsibility for this and vote next November, and show we have a certain set of values and we insist that our leaders reflect those values. "
He reiterated he found Trump’s conduct detailed in the Mueller report “deeply concerning” and that he acknowledges that impeachment is ultimately up to Congress.
“We need an inflection point. An impeachment would deprive us of that. We need to show what we stand for,” he continued.
His comments come as House Democrats mull launching impeachment proceedings against Trump after several days of news related to a call the president had with Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky. Multiple media outlets have reported that Trump asked Zelensky to look into allegations about the Biden family, specifically the former vice president's son.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi denounced Trump's reported conduct, and she hinted that it could push her over the edge to support impeachment.
"I've said to people, 'As soon as we have the facts, we're ready. ' Now we have the facts. We're ready . . . for later today," Pelosi said at the Atlantic's Ideas Summit on Tuesday. She's scheduled to speak at 5 p. m. this evening.
Additionally, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif. , tweeted Tuesday that the whistleblower behind the report would “like to speak to our committee and has requested guidance from the Acting DNI as to how to do so. We‘re in touch with counsel and look forward to the whistleblower’s testimony as soon as this week. ”
Comey has made similar comments in the past and also wrote in a New York Times op-ed that his “one hope” was that the President not be impeached before the end of his term, wanting critics of Trump to focus on getting him out of office through the democratic process in 2020.
Comey has also said in the past that he believes Trump would have been charged with obstruction of justice if he was not a sitting president, based on the findings in special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe report.
At the United Nations in New York, Trump was asked about reports that Pelosi will announce the opening of a formal impeachment inquiry Tuesday evening.
“If she does that, they all say that’s a positive for me in the election,” the president said.

Tokyo 2020 Olympics: Ticket packages 'running scarce' and other insider travel tips

Texto completo: The Tokyo 2020 Olympics are almost here — and if you're going to the games themselves next summer or simply want to soak up the Olympics-tinged atmosphere, you should start planning your journey.
You probably have a lot of questions. Where should I say? When should I book my flights? What is there to do while I'm in Tokyo? What is there to do outside of Tokyo? What is the weather going to be like? But no need to fret, dear travelers: We're here to answer everything we can.
Here's a guide to all your Tokyo-related travel questions ahead of the 2020 Olympics:
When are the 2020 Olympics?
July 24 to Aug. 9. U. S. travelers can still get a ticket, but only as part of a package. CoSport, the U. S. Olympics tickets retailer, is sold out of individual tickets but is waiting to see if it will receive more. You can sign up for their email list. Packages are available on its website that include both tickets and hotel accommodation. One cheaper price, for a doubles trip, is $4,471. 50 per person (for a three-night, four-event package from July 27-30).
But you might want to hurry up: "Packages are still available but are running scarce," Patricia Sweeney, a CoSport customer care associate told USA TODAY in an email.
.
When should I book flights for the Tokyo Olympics?
There are always deals to be had, according to Darci Valiente, a U. S. flight searcher for Scott's Cheap Flights. Valiente recommends booking at least six months in advance. "Because it's for the Olympics, prices will be even more expensive than they already are for peak travel season," Valiente told USA TODAY.
Catherine Heald, CEO and co-founder of Asia tour operator Remote Lands, recommends travelers fly into Haneda Airport as it's closest to the city center. Tokyo's other airport is Narita International Airport.
How much should people expect to pay? Valiente recommends looking for flights under $800, depending on where they are in the U. S. (i. e. if you're leaving from California, go for under $700).
And don't necessarily set your sights on flying directly into Tokyo. "We saw flights to Osaka for peak summer more (numerous) than Toyko — so be flexible about where you fly into and consider taking the train," Valiente says.
Marian Goldberg, The New York Times Travel Show Japan travel expert, recommends booking through a Japanese or Chinese travel agency if you're connecting from Beijing or Shanghai.
Right now, flight prices are more expensive if you want to be in Tokyo for the first few days of the games and the opening ceremony, according to Valiente. The prices drop in the middle to the tail end of the games. Travelers looking to make a 10 to 14-day excursion may want to stagger their journey so they either arrive early and leave in the middle of the games, or arrive in the middle of the games and depart post-Olympics.
Where should I stay?
Travelers have a number of options, including opting for a nearby city like Yokohama, which Amy Tadehara, a senior travel consultant at Inside Japan Tours, refers to as "Tokyo's cosmopolitan younger sibling. " Hop on a train between the two in less than 40 minutes.
Edward Granville, chief operating officer at luxury travel company Red Savannah recommends booking with one of the event's official travel partners and says that the best hotels usually give up their inventory to these groups.
"Despite a construction book in preparation to the Olympics, Tokyo is looking at a massive accommodation shortfall," Japan event travel expert Alan Omlin and long-time Tokyo resident says. The Mizuho Research Institute points to a 14,000-room shortfall for the city.
Airbnb has a significantly reduced presence in the city thanks to a law restricting Airbnb rentals. . Michael Matsuo, a spokesperson for Airbnb, said some hosts haven't made their calendars open to book during that period yet — though a search during the Olympics period for one guest warranted more than 300 places to stay, varying wildly in price per night.
If you decide to book a hotel, know that most Japanese hotels don't let more than three (or even two) people in one room. Rooms are also more expensive, according to Goldberg. "In fact, all Japanese-style accommodations charge per person and not per room," Goldberg says.
Chef Hiroki Odo, owner and chef of o. d. o by ODO, the speakeasy kaiseiki restaurant located in New York’s Flatiron neighborhood, recommends travelers stay at a ryokan (traditional Japanese inn).
Besides the Olympics, what should I do in Tokyo?
Shibuya Crossing
Who knew a crosswalk could also double as a tourist attraction? But Shibuya Crossing isn't just any crosswalk. It could be the world's busiest, according to Lonely Planet, noting that at peak times upwards of 3,000 people cross at a time. It's a scramble intersection, which means all vehicle traffic is stopped to allow pedestrians to cross in every direction, including diagonally, at the same time.
Mount Fuji
Although Mount Fuji technically isn't in Tokyo, it's just a short car, bus or train ride to the active volcano, which is also Japan's tallest mountain. Visitors can explore trails there from early July to early September.
Animal cafes
Tokyo has developed a worldwide reputation for its animal cafes. In addition to getting food and drink, visitors to the cafe are treated to interaction with cute, tame animals, such as hedgehogs, meerkats and ferrets. It's a dream come true for animal lovers.
First time in Tokyo? Here are 5 things you should do
Other notable sights
Takao Nishina, travel agency GetYourGuide's regional manager for Japan, recommends the Tokyo Skytree, the tallest broadcast tower in the world, as well as the Ghibli Museum for animation fanatics and the Samurai Museum.
What else should I do near Tokyo?
Hakone: "Tucked up in the mountains, it's a beautiful hideaway with a gondola that goes up into the mountains and a boat ride tour that sails the gorgeous Ashino Lake," Jay Allen, the publisher of website Unseen Japan, told USA TODAY. Tadehara from Inside Japan Tours says that Hakone's elevation is a pleasant break from Tokyo's summer heat.
Kyoto: Travelers can take a bullet train to "the cultural heart of Japan," Tadehara says. Nearly 2,000 temples and shrines are scattered in the city.
Osaka or Hiroshima: Tadehara adds that you can take a day trip to see foodie haven Osaka or even Hiroshima, where the first atomic bomb dropped.
Yokohama: Check out Minato Mirai, a portside area that has "spectacular fireworks" in the summer, according to Allen.
Kamakura: Go here to see Komachi-dori, "a rich shopping section filled with small shops and restaurants; the Great Buddha of Kamakura at the Kotoku Temple, which has been preserved from the 13th century until today; and the oceanside shoreline of Kamakura, which offers spectacular sunsets," Allen says.
Anything else I should keep in mind?
"One of the greatest misconceptions about Japan is that it can be unapproachable and difficult to navigate effectively because of the language barrier and cultural formality," Tadehara says. "Though it is true that English is not as prevalent here as it is in other non-English speaking countries, getting around and immersing in authentic experiences is easy with a little preparation. "
Getting around
The city is easy to get around via public transportation, though taxis are an affordable option. "Taxis are easy to get, most take credit cards, and they can be used affordably for short distances within a neighborhood," Goldberg says.

Texto completo: In the Trump era, a columnist risks appearing like the boy (or girl) who cried wolf. Time and time again, we say this scandal is the big one.
But in our ill-fated version of the story, the wolf comes every time. The violations of morality and law have become progressively bolder and more dangerous to the constitutional order. And they have culminated in an abuse of power both highly serious and totally unconcealed.
By his own admission, the president of the United States urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to open a criminal investigation of the son of a political rival. Trump denies that this request involved a quid pro quo. But with Ukraine engaged in conflict with Russian-backed separatists, and with $250 million in American military aid being held up (at the time) for "review," the threat did not need to be explicit in order to be palpable and powerful.
This groundbreaking form of political corruption shocked everyone with a conscience who was privy to it. U.S. embassy staff in Kiev expressed alarm about Rudy Giuliani’s contacts with Ukrainian officials. A whistleblower in the intelligence community risked his or her career to report it. The intelligence community’s inspector general found the matter of "urgent concern." But acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire and the Department of Justice — playing the role of political enforcers — have blocked the transmission of the whistleblower’s report to Congress. They are pursuing a cover-up in plain sight.
Here we need to be clear. Treating the presidency in this fashion is not only corrupt but unpatriotic. Trump has set his own interests above the interests of the nation. The American criminal justice system was created to deal with normal types of political corruption, not with a rogue president, testing the limits of executive power. That form of warped ambition must be checked and balanced by the coequal branches of government. But many members of Congress — mostly Republicans but also some Democrats — appear to have lost their taste for that role.
The political risk to elected Republicans when they oppose Trump appears very real. But the moral hazard is far greater. When they use their office to shield shady political dealings, they become a party to public corruption. When they ignore or excuse Trump’s use of the nation’s power and influence for private reasons, they have chosen Trump above their country. Worst of all, they are teaching their political supporters that the rule of law is a small and expendable thing.
In the scarier regions of the Trump right, the problem is far advanced. Every revelation of the president’s abuse of power is met with a sentence beginning: "But Biden ..." Their tolerance for corruption seems limitless — and frightening. By what firm political principle would they condemn Trump if he closed down The New York Times (an "enemy of the people") or arrested a few whistleblowers (part of the "deep state" that is conducting a "coup")?
None of this seems possible. But too many impossibilities have recently become realities. Opposing Trump’s corrupt abuse of power — here, now, before it goes further — is the calling of patriotism in our time.

Texto completo: As expected, liberals spent most of the weekend screaming "IMPEACH!" over news that President Donald Trump had again done something that is likely an impeachable offense.
This time around it involves a phone call with the incoming Ukranian president, a whistleblower report regarding that phone call that a Trump appointee found to be of "urgent concern" and a blatant attempt by the president of the United States to get a foreign country to interfere in the 2020 election.
Will these libs ever just give it a rest?
Because he's super good at doing crimes, Trump and his attorney, Rudy Giuliani, spent the weekend effectively acknowledging that they did, in fact, try to get a foreign power to launch an investigation into widely debunked allegations against Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.
That's just good presidenting right there: You know there's a debunked scandal against your potential opponent. You know facts are stupid. So you lean on a foreign country to reincarnate a dead scandal and then let that zombie scandal eat what's left of your supporters' brains.
What president wouldn't do that, aside from all presidents who came before Trump?
To make this easy for the weak-minded lefties, I'm going to detail five iron-clad reasons Trump should not be impeached for committing -- and admitting to committing -- an impeachable offense.
1) Trump is pulling a reverse-Nixon, and you can't impeach a president who pulls a reverse-Nixon.
In 1973, President Richard Nixon famously denied involvement in the Watergate cover-up by saying, "I am not a crook!" Articles of impeachment would've been filed against Nixon had he remained in office.
But Trump's reverse-Nixon has him effectively saying, "I am a crook!"
On Sunday, in perfectly normal and easy-to-understand English, the president spoke about the call in which he reportedly pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to relaunch a closed investigation into Biden: "The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place, was largely the fact that we don't want our people, like Vice President Biden and his son, creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine."
So there it is. Did the president of the United States ask the president of a foreign country that was eagerly awaiting $250 million in U.S. aid to target a political opponent? Yes. Is that a clear attempt by Trump to use the power of his office to benefit himself and put self-interest above the interest of the nation? Heck yeah! Is the administration breaking the law and engaging in a cover-up by keeping the whistleblower report relating to this matter from congressional oversight committees? Yeppers.
But because Trump up and admitted it all -- successfully pulling off the never-before-achieved reverse-Nixon -- there's no way Congress can impeach. Look it up, it's in the Constitution. Probably.
2) Trump is having fun committing impeachable offenses, and it would be mean to stop him now.
On Sunday, New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman tweeted about the Ukraine scandal: "The president, per people close to him, is enjoying all this as it plays out."
Clearly, Trump gets a real kick out of "triggering the libs" by mowing down the fundamental standards of our democracy and "faithfully executing the Office of President of the United States" only in the literal, murdering it sense.
Don't take that away from him. Maybe he's the self-proclaimed most successful president ever because he gets to commit impeachable offenses without consequence. Everyone deserves some joy in life.
3) You can't impeach Trump for doing bad things because other people may also have done bad things, possibly.
The minute you bring up any alleged misdeed by Donald Trump, his supporters scream, "OH YEAH, WELL WHAT ABOUT THAT TIME (INSERT NAME OF EVIL LIBERAL) DID EXACTLY THE SAME THING?!?"
They will have no factual basis for their argument, but that doesn't matter because they say it forcefully and refuse to admit they're wrong. That, as any first-year law student will tell you, makes it true.
For example, if I murder someone, I can just make up a story about how another person murdered someone and didn't get charged, and that would insulate me from prosecution.
So did Trump violate his oath of office? Yes. But did Hillary Clinton violate her oath of office when she was president by allowing aliens to lure rural Americans to untoward sex parties in the basement of a pizza parlor? Absolutely.
Game. Set. Match.
4) Impeaching Trump would damage the Democrats' carefully honed "We're too afraid to impeach Trump" brand.
Congressional Democrats have spent the past three years not flexing their political muscles and pretending Trump is a normal political figure who can be contained by silly things like "rules" and "laws" and "basic common decency."
Their inaction has emboldened Trump to think he can just get on the phone with a foreign leader and ask him to dig up dirt on a political opponent. Why would Democrats want to undo all the non-good they've done by suddenly cracking down on a lawless president? Totally off-brand.
5) Impeachment will rile up Trump's base and divide the country, two things that are definitely not already happening.
If Democrats try to impeach President Trump, his supporters -- known for their calm demeanor and openness to hearing both sides -- might get angry. That would be terrible for Democrats' chances of winning over people who think Trump -- who according to the Washington Post's fact-checker has told more than 12,000 false or misleading claims in less than 1,000 days -- is a great truth-teller.
It also might divide the country by exposing the extent of Trump's corruption and giving the truth a chance to win out.
Which would be terrible. For Donald Trump.

THE NATION; More lawmakers join impeachment call; Senate to take up Trump's Ukraine dealings as pressure grows in Congress.

Texto completo: Pressure in Congress to consider impeachment proceedings against President Trump grew Monday as new reports said he had ordered a holdup of aid to Ukraine just days before urging that country's president to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a possible Trump opponent in the 2020 presidential race.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Senate Intelligence Committee would look into the whistleblower complaint that reportedly alleges Trump tried to pressure the Ukrainian leader to help him politically.
And a group of freshman Democrats from competitive House districts who had previously opposed impeachment said the allegations against Trump, if true, "represent an impeachable offense."

"These allegations are stunning, both in the national security threat they pose and the potential corruption they represent," the freshmen legislators wrote in an op-ed for the Washington Post.
The signers, including Reps. Abigail Spanberger (D-Va.), Mikie Sherrill (D-N.J.) and Gil Cisneros (D-Yorba Linda), all have national security backgrounds, and six had previously opposed impeachment. Their position is likely to weigh heavily on Democratic leaders who have been reluctant to move toward an effort to remove Trump from office.
The new developments came as the Post and the New York Times reported that Trump had ordered White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney to hold up about $400 million in military aid to Ukraine a few days before he spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in July.
Still, only a handful of Republicans demanded that the Trump administration turn over the whistleblower's complaint to the panel. Reports that Trump spoke to a foreign leader about his political rival -- and has refused to hand over a whistleblower's complaint about it -- have put congressional Republicans in the politically perilous position of choosing whether to defend the president.
House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Burbank) said the acting director of national intelligence has refused to turn over the information.
Only a few Republicans criticized that decision and publicly called for the Trump administration to hand over the contents of the whistleblower complaint, or expressed concern about the seriousness of the allegations. Many other GOP lawmakers refused to weigh in, saying they didn't know the full story.
Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) called it "a very serious matter" and said determining what Trump and his attorney, Rudolph W. Giuliani, said to Ukrainian officials "is critical."
Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said she wanted to see the whistleblower's complaint. "The law is clear that if the inspector general of the intelligence community received a whistleblower complaint that the IG deems is urgent, that that is to be reported to the leaders of the intelligence committee," Collins said.
Asked whether the president should be talking about political opponents with foreign leaders, Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) said, "Probably not."
In a letter Monday to McConnell, Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) warned that Republicans risked appearing "silent and submissive" if they failed to look into the matter, noting that the complaint "has been labeled 'urgent' and 'credible' not by Democrats, but by a senior-level Trump appointee."
Trump has claimed that the whistleblower is partisan, tweeting Monday that the person -- who has not been publicly identified -- "doesn't know the correct facts. Is he on our country's side. Where does he come from."
But on Sunday, the president acknowledged that he brought up Biden during his conversation with Zelensky, insisting there was nothing inappropriate about it.
Three additional Democrats on Monday announced their support for an impeachment inquiry. One of them, Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.), said the new allegations continued "a pattern of behavior that is corrupt at best, treasonous at worst, and puts our rule of law at risk."

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
Call them what you want: Jitters, nerves, butterflies. They're present at every starting line, no matter how many races we've run. And at the Fifth Avenue Mile, earlier this month, things were no different.
The anxieties could be heard in our chatter as we talked about our goals. They could be felt in our feet as we jogged and stretched in place to warm up. And they were palpable in our chests, in the form of flutters that could only be eased by one thing.
And there it was: CRACK! A starter pistol signaled that the race had begun.
In a rush, The New York Times running team, composed of dozens of employees, disappeared down the hill. Our competition with other media companies extends beyond trying to be first to break news; for decades, we've also raced against one another in Central Park.
Our team gets together often. We regularly do speed runs on Wednesdays and weekend runs to doughnut shops across the city. But this was a special occasion.
The Fifth Avenue Mile is an annual competition that draws more than 9,000 athletes -- including some of the fastest pros -- to the eastern end of Central Park in Manhattan.
This month, our team claimed the title of Fastest Media Team at the Fifth Avenue Mile, beating out dozens of other runners from newspapers, websites, TV stations and other outlets.
You might not think that a bunch of newspaper employees would have any athletic skill -- in old movies, newsrooms were usually depicted as smoke-filled, with flasks stashed in every desk drawer -- but The Times has been competing against several other New York City-based media groups in races for more than 40 years.
Every summer, we run a series of five 3.5-mile races in Central Park against our fierce competitors at HBO, CBS, NBC, Fox, ABC, Condé Nast, Sony and Standard & Poor's.
Our inaugural Media Challenge was on July 12, 1978, when The Times had about 20 members competing in a field of 1,200 runners. The team's inception coincided with a running boom in New York City, so it was no surprise that the next year the field grew to 3,100. Today our team has about 150 members.
Before each race begins, our ritual is to stand in a circle, introduce ourselves and say what our roles are at The Times. Our members come from all corners of the office; we're not just reporters and editors.
Brian Fidelman, a newsroom planning editor, said meeting new people was one of the most enriching parts of being on the team.
"Even though we used to joke, 'If you see a Fox News jersey, run like hell,' the league is so warm and collegial," he said. "We're competing against each other, but we're actually all in it together, enjoying a gorgeous evening in Central Park."
Mr. Fidelman, a former captain who has been on the team for 24 years, said not much had changed during that time.
"The biggest change has been the shirts: Once heavy cotton, they are now lighter than air," he said referencing the moisture-wicking fabrics that have become common in athletic wear.
Many of us are now training to run in the New York City Marathon in November. Our mileage is up, our legs are aching, our appetites are ravenous and our self-doubt about whether we can make it through 26.2 miles is intense.
That worry, of not knowing how your journey to the end will go, is not unusual for a group of people who are constantly racing to meet the deadlines of a daily newspaper. But anytime we hit a wall, at least we know we can look out on the course and easily find a teammate to run with.

Texto completo: The Democratic National Committee said it would impose slightly higher thresholds to qualify for the November debate.
WASHINGTON -- The Democratic National Committee said on Monday that it would demand a slight increase in the polling and fund-raising thresholds that presidential candidates must meet in order to qualify for the party's November primary debate, a move that may once again shrink the field of participating candidates.
To be invited to the November debate, candidates must have received donations from at least 165,000 individual donors and must meet one of two polling requirements. They must either receive 3 percent support in four national or early-state polls conducted by qualifying pollsters, or 5 percent support in two polls in the four early states: Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina.
Polls will count if they were publicly released between Sept. 13 and midnight seven days before the debate. The date and location of the November debate have yet to be announced.
At least 11 candidates have already met the 165,000-donor threshold, according to an analysis by The New York Times. Only three qualifying polls have been released since Sept. 13., and two of them were national polls, meaning no candidates have fully qualified for the November debate yet.
Candidates must also prove they have at least 600 unique donors in at least 20 states, United States territories or the District of Columbia, the D.N.C. said.
As the Democratic primary has progressed, party officials have gradually tightened the standards for debate qualification, making it harder and harder to clear the bar.
The 20 candidates who participated in the two-night debates held in June and July only had to amass donations from 65,000 people or reach 1 percent support in three qualifying polls. The qualification standards for this month's debate were much stricter: Candidates were required to collect donations from 130,000 unique donors and achieve 2 percent support in four qualifying polls.
Only 10 candidates cleared the higher bar and the debate was held over just one night. With the addition of Tom Steyer, the former hedge fund investor, 11 candidates have already qualified for the October debate, which has the same requirements. Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii needs just one more qualifying poll result to make the cut.
The repeated tightening of the standards has caused considerable consternation among the candidates, causing many to gripe about the rules and nudging some to drop out of the race altogether. Aides to several of the second-tier candidates feared that Tom Perez, the D.N.C. chairman, would raise the bar much higher, effectively limiting the debate field to just a handful of candidates.
The modest threshold increase for the November debate came as a relief to on-the-bubble campaigns that had been preparing for a requirement of up to 260,000 individual donors, which would have forced unpleasant decisions about whether to divert resources from grass-roots organizing to online advertising in search of new donors.
Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington and John Hickenlooper, the former Colorado governor, exited the race in August after it became clear that they would not qualify for the fall debates. Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York dropped out last week after failing to qualify for the September debate and realizing he stood almost no chance of getting onstage next month.
Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and former Representative Beto O'Rourke of Texas, who both participated in the September debate and have qualified for the October one, have in recent weeks emailed appeals to supporters warning they could be left off the stage in November and December without an uptick in their fund-raising.
Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey sent a message to supporters over the weekend, saying that without an infusion of $ 1.7 million by the end of the month his campaign may no longer be viable. On Monday, he sent another email acknowledging the newly released debate thresholds, noting that he had not reached 165,000 individual donors and asking supporters to chip in. According to the Times analysis, he is the only candidate who has participated in all of the debates and has not yet reached 165,000 donors.
Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana, who did not qualify for the September debate and is not likely to make the stage for October's, has been one of the most vocal critics of the process.
He renewed his attacks this month after it became clear that Mr. Steyer would qualify for the October debate after using millions of dollars of his own money to buy advertisements that have helped him draw in donations and increase his standing in the polls.
"At this point, there isn't much left to be said regarding a set of rules that have allowed a billionaire to bankroll his way onto the debate stage, while governors and senators with decades of public service experience have been forced out of the race," said Mr. Bullock, who has failed to earn 2 percent in a single qualifying poll. "This process is failing Democrats and does nothing to help us beat Donald Trump next November."
The D.N.C.'s announcement may begin a new cycle of protests and recriminations from candidates who do not qualify. But while riding on a campaign bus in Iowa on Sunday, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., who seems likely to make the November debate stage, was circumspect.
"I think it's mission impossible for the D.N.C. to please everybody," he said.

Texto completo: A bandleader, composer and educator, he was sought after by top musicians to record with them, drawn by his harmonic sophistication and feel for the blues.
Harold Mabern, a pianist, composer, recording artist and teacher whose richly harmonic, soul-inflected style made him a sought-after bandmate for some of jazz's premier musicians, died on Sept. 17 in New Jersey. He was 83.
The cause was a heart attack, his publicist, Maureen McFadden, said. She declined to specify the exact location of his death.
Starting in the 1960s, Mr. Mabern (pronounced MAY-burn) recorded more than two dozen albums as a bandleader, but he contributed to far more in bands led by luminaries like the trumpet player Lee Morgan, the guitarist Wes Montgomery and the vocalist Betty Carter.
His employers leaned on him not only for his lush and muscular playing -- often rendered in two-handed block chords so that harmony, melody and rhythm came all at once -- but also for his compositions. Tunes like "The Beehive" and "Richie's Dilemma" were built from Mr. Mabern's signature composite of harmonic sophistication, blues feeling and sharply punctuated swing rhythm.
"He was just such a complete musician," the saxophonist George Coleman, a lifelong musical collaborator with Mr. Mabern, said in a phone interview. "He was always adventurous, and he was always swinging, keeping the crowd pleased."
At well over six feet tall, with broad shoulders and a gentle hunch, Mr. Mabern put his physical heft into his music -- playing, as he said in a 2015 interview, "from my shoulders, from my whole body."
Reviewing a concert by Mr. Coleman's quartet for The New York Times in 2003, Ben Ratliff observed: "Mr. Mabern carpeted each tune with thick chords, almost never letting up until it was time for a bass or drum solo -- at which point, instead of trudging through a dull accompaniment, he enacted spare, nicely worked-out arrangements to accent the solo."
Mr. Mabern came of age in the Memphis music scene of the 1950s, where jazz kept company with other forms of black popular music. In Memphis, he told the French magazine Jazz Hot, the blues "was a way of life."
He taught himself to play the piano while in high school, largely at the elbow of two local phenoms, the pianists Phineas Newborn Jr. and Charles Thomas. Six months after taking up the instrument, he was playing professionally alongside Mr. Coleman, in gigs that earned him $ 1 a night.
Many of his friends from those years went on to illustrious careers, and he would work with some of them frequently after he moved to New York City in 1959.
For nearly 40 years Mr. Mabern taught at William Paterson University in New Jersey, where his students included the tenor saxophonist Eric Alexander and the drummer Joe Farnsworth. Both have gone on to become successful bandleaders, and both played in Mr. Mabern's ensembles for the rest of his life.
"I don't have to rehearse with those guys," Mr. Mabern proudly told London Jazz News in 2014. "I just play and they know what to do."
He is survived by two children, Michael and Roxanne Mabern, and a granddaughter. His sister, Nettie, and his wife of nearly 40 years, Beatrice, died before him.
Harold Mabern Jr. was born in Memphis on March 20, 1936, to Harold and Elnora Mabern. His father worked for middling wages in a lumberyard, but after discovering that his teenage son could play melodies back from memory, he saved up to buy the family a piano, for $ 60.
At Manassas High School, which had a strong music program, Mr. Mabern's classmates included Mr. Coleman, the trumpeter Booker Little and the saxophonist Charles Lloyd, all future jazz stars.
After high school Mr. Mabern moved to Chicago to play in a band led by the saxophonist Frank Strozier, another former classmate. He attended classes at the American Conservatory of Music, joined a big band and practiced, he later said, for 12 hours a day.
Prepared to make the leap, Mr. Mabern relocated to New York at age 23, arriving with $ 5,000 tucked into his shoes. Soon after his arrival, he ran into the alto saxophonist Cannonball Adderley, who was on his way to becoming one of the country's most popular jazz musicians.
"Cannonball knew me from Chicago, saw me and said, 'Hey, Big Hands, you want a gig?"' Mr. Mabern said in an interview for Jazz at Lincoln Center. "I said, 'Sure!"'
That night Adderley took him to Birdland, where he introduced Mr. Mabern to a gaggle of other leading jazz musicians. Work soon followed with the likes of Miles Davis and Lionel Hampton. He released his first album, "A Few Miles From Memphis," in 1968, one of four he would record for Prestige Records.
Mr. Mabern worked mostly as a side musician in the 1970s and '80s, but a record deal with the Japanese label DIW in 1989 revivified his bandleading career. Over his last three decades, when not teaching, he was often at the helm of his own small groups. He became a regular presence at New York clubs, particularly Smoke. He recorded his last four albums for the club's label, Smoke Sessions.
Reflecting on his career, Mr. Mabern described himself unpretentiously as "a blues player with chops," borrowing a phrase from the pianist Gene Harris. "I'm never going to stop being a blues pianist," he said.

Bob Iger Acknowledges Disney Overused ‘Star Wars’ Too Quickly

Texto completo: Despite concerns to the contrary, Disney is not a monopolistic monster here to destroy cinema. In fact, Disney is just the studio best equipped to thrive in today’s brand-driven cinematic ecosystem. The studio owns the most sought-after titles thanks to savvy and expensive acquisitions such as Pixar Animation, Marvel Entertainment, Lucasfilm and 21st Century Fox. This has given CEO Bob Iger access to marquee franchises such as Toy Story , the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Avatar and, of course, Star Wars . But reality can often diverge from fantasy when one is planning for the future.
Solo: A Star Wars Story arrived in 2018 just six months after Rian Johnson’s divisive The Last Jedi . The Han Solo prequel suffered a troubling creative shakeup behind the scenes with mere weeks left in production when Lucasfilm head Kathleen Kennry replaced original directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller were replaced with Ron Howard. This not only elicited concern from ticket buyers, but yielded costly production delays and expensive re-shoots that pushed the film’s budget upwards of $300 million. Ultimately, Disney would lose around $50 million on the film, but Iger would learn a valuable lesson in the process.
“I just think that we might’ve put a little bit too much in the marketplace too fast,” Iger recently told the New York Times . Since 2015, Disney has released four theatrical Star Wars pictures which have grossed more than $4.5 billion worldwide combined. December’s The Rise of Skywalker , the conclusion to the nine-episode main saga, will only add to that total. After that, Disney will wait three years before it releases the next Star Wars picture in theaters.
“I think the storytelling capabilities of the company are endless because of the talent we have at the company, and the talent we have at the company is better than it’s ever been, in part because of the influx of people from Fox,” Iger said. Fox distributed the previous Star Wars films before Disney purchased Lucasfilm.
The financial disappointment of Solo , which grossed $214 million domestic but just $393 million worldwide, sidelined a handful of Star Wars spinoffs Lucasfilm was reportedly developing. This included a standalone Obi-Wan Kenobi feature with Ewan McGregor and a Boba Fett film to be directed by Ford v Ferrari ‘s James Mangold.
Instead, Lucasfilm will refocus its efforts on the small screen for the foreseeable future. McGregor will reprise his iconic role in a Disney+ series; Jon Favreau is overseeing the highly-anticipated The Mandalorian ; and Rogue One ‘s Diego Luna will return as Cassian Andor in an untitled prequel show. The idea at Disney is that by the time 2022 rolls around, fans will once again be hungry for a big screen blockbuster Star Wars adventure.

Texto completo: So now people are guilty until proven innocent? Our judicial system since the founding of this nation has been based on the premise that an individual accused of some form of wrongdoing is innocent until proven guilty by the accuser. In the past few years, it appears that the opposite is now the new norm.
Just think, anyone at any time can accuse anybody of anything. Your neighbor could accuse you of something terrible and the rest of the neighborhood and the local news media immediately determine that you are guilty. Your reputation is ruined, your kids are attacked in school and your employer fires you.
The truth is that you never committed the “crime” and it is determined that the accuser is a nut case, but the stigma is still on you and your family. It never really goes away.
This is where our news media and society are going.
The latest example is the new accusation against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. The New York Times, taking an excerpt from a forthcoming book, has “uncovered” another alleged instance of sexual misconduct. The supposed victim has said she has no recollection of the incident, but Kavanaugh must be guilty because The New York Times, the Valley News, and most of the Democratic presidential candidates say so.
The alleged victim has absolutely no knowledge of the crime. Therefore, there is no crime, there is no guilt.
Apologies and retractions to follow? Highly unlikely. Kavanaugh must be guilty because he hasn’t proven his innocence.

Biomass demand would not be good for the forest
As co-director of Biofuelwatch, I have assisted communities resisting biomass and biofuel proposals for more than a decade. I have learned that claims made about biomass supply, the kind of wood that is needed, the impacts of harvests on forests, costs and air pollution generally turn out to be incorrect.
Put Blodgett, in his recent Opinion column (“Dartmouth biomass project would help forests, economy,” Sept. 13), rightfully questions what alternatives might exist for heating the campus, and requests that Dartmouth College reveal the details of its analyses. But his claims that a demand for biomass would be good for the forest compel a rebuttal.
First, natural forests are nothing like vegetable gardens, as he suggests. Vegetable gardens are essentially monocultures (or collections of monoculture patches), the goal being rapid growth and turnover. This is about as unlike a natural forest ecosystem as possible. But it has been key to the business model of the timber/pulp industry, which aims to replace natural forests with tree plantations.
Organizations around the world, including the Global Forest Coalition (on whose board I serve), have opposed the confounding of plantations and forests for decades, demanding that the U.N. definition of “forest” discriminate between the two.
Tree monocultures are often referred to as “green deserts.” Study after study has demonstrated the lack of biodiversity, impacts on soils and waterways and reduced carbon sequestration of tree plantations as compared to natural forests. Left to their own devices, without any interference from us, natural forests store more carbon than “managed” forests. That includes carbon, nutrients and biodiversity that is held in “deadwood” and “low-grade” timber.
Common sense tells us that it is not possible to provide enough “low-grade” wood from within a 40-50 mile radius of the Dartmouth campus to provide heat to 119 buildings for the next 30-40 years.
Putting such a demand in place would create a wood market indeed, and that would likely be profitable for tree farmers in the region. But let’s not delude ourselves that it would be good for the forests.

Texto completo: Believe it or not, it was a year ago that a constellation of left-wing activist groups cooked up a series of outlandish lies designed to keep Brett Kavanaugh off the Supreme Court.
The national news media, as you will remember, joined the smear campaign. They repeated and magnified the slurs. But in the end, it was to no effect. Justice Kavanaugh was confirmed anyway. Why? Because not a single allegation against him was proven to be true. Not one. Their only lasting effect was to traumatize Kavanaugh's wife and children.
To this day, the left has never apologized for their dishonesty or their profound cruelty. They did not accept defeat. They never do. Why? Because when politics is your religion, acknowledging reality looks like sin, and so it continues.
A few days ago, New York Times reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly were the toast of the left. Their new book appeared to finish the job that the national media started a year ago and take out Justice Kavanaugh for good. The authors accused Justice Kavanaugh of committing sexual assault as a student at Yale more than 30 years ago. Details were sparse, but it was enough to launch a tsunami of rage from the left. Chatters on cable TV denounced Justice Kavanaugh as a gang rapist. The leading Democrats running for president demanded that Justice Kavanaugh be impeached and removed from office.
Almost immediately, the story fell apart. The newspaper was forced to make a devastating correction to the piece. In fact, the woman that Justice Kavanaugh supposedly attacked didn't remember anything about the event. And just like so many previous stories about Justice Kavanaugh, the whole thing turned out to be a crock.
The Times reporters were grilled by other news outlets. The explanation? Don't blame us; blame our editors. But a missing line is not the only problem with the story. Where did the story come from? It came secondhand from a single classmate of Justice Kavanaugh's, a man who worked as a left-wing activist and later for the Clintons.
Of course, 20 years ago, no credible news organization would have run a story like that on the basis of its sourcing. The Times didn't hesitate, and it was picked up everywhere. When a character-destroying smear comes from political activists rather than from, say, ordinary citizens, you ought to be able to know that from reading the piece. The Times disagrees, though. They don't think you have a right to that context.
All this has now been disclosed and The Times story discredited. You'd think it would spur the Democratic candidates, the ones who called for Justice Kavanaugh's impeachment, to rethink their positions. New evidence? Maybe that would shape their view. But no, not at all. They sound exactly as they did a year ago.
They are not trying to convict Justice Kavanaugh. They are trying to destroy him and his family. Due process and presumption of innocence - fairness even - are irrelevant. This is a pure power grab. The left feels entitled to run the country, and they feel entitled to control the Supreme Court. It drives them crazy that they don't. Justice Kavanaugh frustrates their political hopes, so any smear against him is acceptable, no matter what it is.
Don't kid yourself. It's not just about destroying Justice Kavanaugh. It's about destroying the entire legitimacy of our third branch of government, the judiciary. Plenty on the left are using the saga to call for packing the court, adding more justices to make it reliably left-wing or to change the rules so they can remove any judge they don't approve of.
This is the opposite of what the third branch was meant to do. The judiciary was meant to change slowly, the courts to change over decades rather than in response to a single election cycle. It was designed that way and for a reason. For more than 200 years, it's worked.
But to the modern left, it's totally intolerable. They are committed to completely remaking this country right now. We need a new system, they tell us, one with open borders and far fewer pesky individual rights. Rights like the freedom to speak clearly, the freedom of expression, the freedom of religion and the right to bear arms must go. They have to destroy all of that - two centuries of precedent and tradition - and maybe even the country itself.
Whatever. They are happy to do it. When you make omelets, you break eggs.

Texto completo: After Manafort scandal, country is embroiled in another high-stakes fight
KIEV, Ukraine - Ukraine isn't an American military ally. Its economic connections to the United States scarcely rank. Its troubles with Russia have largely faded from U.S. headlines.
And yet, for the second time since 2016, this country finds itself embroiled in a major Washington scandal.
President Trump's push to get Ukrainian leaders to investigate the family of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has dragged a war-torn country back into the crosshairs of American partisan politics. Once again, what happens in Kiev could shape the course of U.S. political fortunes. And once again, Ukrainians are asking themselves why they are getting pulled into the scorched-earth battle zone between Trump and his opponents.
Events in this country, pinched between the European Union and Russia and pulled by eastward and westward forces, have unusual power in Trump-era Washington.
Kiev already played a major role in the scandal that took down Paul Manafort. Trump's 2016 campaign chairman earned millions of dollars advising Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych before he was ousted by protests in 2014. A black ledger detailing Ukrainian government payments to Manafort surfaced in August 2016, leading to Manafort's resignation from the campaign and then contributing to the criminal case that sent him away for seven years for tax and bank fraud.
In the years before Yanukovych's ouster, as Manafort delivered commanding political success to his Ukrainian client, others were studying his work. Although Ukraine is poorer than its neighbor, Russia, it has enough cash to fuel a heady life for those who want to join its political trench fighting.
"In Ukraine, many people have quite a lot of money, many people have a bad reputation and want to improve it, and many people want to improve their connection with the West," said Anders Aslund, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. "Ukraine is much more open than Russia, that is the quality, and if you're open, you get more U.S. criminals coming in, also."
Analysts and policymakers say Ukraine draws attention because it has an unusual blend of cash (it's a key transit country for Russian natural gas), a history of corruption and competitive elections. Americans such as Manafort and Trump's personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, have found ready clients in Ukraine, where people think that U.S. political wisdom can get results.
"In Ukraine, politics is dirty but still competitive," said Andrew Wilson, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. "So you have all sides arming themselves with these techniques."
That's a contrast with Russia, which has far deeper stores of money but where politics has been dominated for two decades by one man: President Vladimir Putin. The Russian market largely closed to Americans after 2014, when the Obama administration imposed sanctions on Russia for its role in the conflict in Ukraine and business ties dried up.
In Ukraine, Manafort is deeply tied in the public mind to the corruption of the Yanukovych era. When the ledger of payments surfaced in 2016, diplomats in Kiev figured the disclosure was motivated by Ukrainian anger about his work in their political system. Trump was unpopular in Kiev because of his admiration for Putin, but few thought it was part of a broader Ukrainian vendetta against the Trump campaign because no one at the time expected the campaign to be victorious.
But in Trump-era Washington, the president's backers have portrayed the episode differently, as part of a Ukrainian government conspiracy to interfere in the 2016 campaign.
Giuliani, whose consulting group counts among its clients several prominent Ukrainians, has targeted the former lawmaker Serhiy Leshchenko, who helped publicize the ledger. In a May appearance on Fox News, Giuliani named Leshchenko as one of a group of "enemies of the president, in some cases enemies of the United States," who were close to newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
Leshchenko says his actions have been distorted.
"Instead of applauding me because I have put in jail a criminal, Mr. Manafort, who is found guilty by American judges and American grand juries, they have started attacking me," he said.
Leshchenko advised Zelensky's campaign. But he said Giuliani's vendetta had forced him to leave the new leader's team to avoid harming relations between Ukraine and the United States.
In an opinion piece published Saturday by The Washington Post, he offered to testify before Congress.
But if the end of the Yanukovych era cast out American consultants including Manafort, the turmoil pulled in others with Washington connections. One energy company, Burisma, hired several well-connected Democrats, including Hunter Biden, Joe Biden's son, who became a board member in 2014.
At the time, his father was vice president and a leader in the Obama administration's response to the crisis in Ukraine.
The younger Biden didn't provide direct support to politicians. He earned up to $50,000 per month for his work on the energy company's board, the New York Times has reported, which made some State Department officials uneasy about the potential for an appearance of a conflict of interest, former officials said.
Joe Biden has said he never spoke to his son about the Burisma work.
Ukrainian prosecutors launched investigations in 2014 into alleged illegal activities at Burisma, including money laundering and abuse of office by company owner Mykola Zlochevsky. Zlochevsky and Burisma denied the allegations. One of the probes, for income tax evasion, was settled with a fine. The others did not result in convictions.
Ukrainian prosecutors have said there is no evidence of improper behavior by Hunter Biden.
Still, Trump and Giuliani have sought to propel Hunter Biden's Ukrainian business dealings into the public sphere.
The Post has reported that an intelligence official filed a whistleblower complaint centering on a July 25 phone conversation between Trump and Zelensky in which Trump asked for an investigation into Hunter Biden.
Trump on Sunday acknowledged raising the Bidens with Zelensky.
"The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place, was largely the fact that we don't want our people, like Vice President Biden and his son, creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine," Trump told reporters.
Hunter Biden is no longer on the Burisma payroll. In the Trump era, a different cast of characters is winning contracts in Ukraine.
One of the players? Giuliani. His clients include Kharkiv Mayor Gennady Kernes, once an ally of Yanukovych.

Branded hijabs send 'powerful message'

Texto completo: Headnote TORONTO RAPTORS
The Toronto Raptors have intro duced a new line of team-branded hijabs in an effort to be more inclusive to fans of all cultures.
The team partnered with Nike to design the hijabs - head coverings worn by some Muslim women - and unveiled them on Twitter, saying the athletic apparel was "inspired by those brave enough to change the game."
The Raptors, which are owned by Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment, claimed to be the first team in the National Basketball Association to offer an athletic hijab, The Associated Press reported.
Jerry Ferguson, the company's senior marketing director, told the AP that the idea was inspired by the Hijabi Bailers, a local organization that promotes Muslim women in sports.
"They really wanted to involve local Muslim female athletes," Amreen Kadwa, the group's founder, said Sunday. "There was a genuine partnership and interest to highlight this group, making it authentic to the Muslim community."
Kadwa, who founded the group two years ago, said 10 to 20 women regularly show up to weekly gatherings.
"It's been received positively among Muslim females and Raptors fans," she said of the new apparel. "Toronto is a great multicultural city to introduce something like this."
More than 400,000 Muslims live in the Toronto area, according to national data from 2011, the most recent available.
The Council on American-Islamic Relations, the largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization in the United States, praised the new hijabs.
"It sends a powerful message of inclusion to the Muslim community," Ibrahim Hooper, the group's national communications director, said. "I think the Raptors deserve to be congratulated for taking a step that other teams have yet to make."
Norm O'Reilly, director of the International Institute for Sport Business and Leadership at the University of Guelph near Toronto, said the marketing decision was a big step but not a surprising one.
He said it reminded him of when the National Football League started marketing clothing for women.
"When that initially happened, there was a lot of public press and the campaign was scrutinized, but now it's common practice," he said. "It takes a first step to push for acceptance in a gender, race or cultural issue, but it usually ends up working out in the end."
He said that it was possible the organization would lose fans over the branded hijabs, but that the team must have determined the benefits outweighed the risk. Some critics on social media called hijabs a symbol of oppression.
O'Reilly compared the move to the time Nike used Colin Kaepernick, the divisive quarterback who knelt during national anthems in protest of police brutality and social injustice, as the face of its marketing campaign.
"From a marketing perspective, those who don't embrace change and humanity tend to not have things work out as well in the longer run," he said. "It's the natural progression. The NBA is global and the Raptors have a global audience."
Irving J. Rein, a professor of communications studies at Northwestern University, said that some people would find the branded hijabs empowering and others would find them offensive, but that it was hard to say how many people might stop watching the Raptors because of them.
"Athletes are really speaking out about controversial topics in ways that they've not spoken out before," he said, citing Kaepernick and LeBron James. "We're living in a space that we don't understand very well and the ability to predict is very difficult."

Texto completo: Las Cruces-based children's author Jennifer Cervantes – pen name J.C. Cervantes – is now a three-time New York Times best-selling author.
Her latest book, "The Fire Keeper," released Sept. 3, debuted at No. 4 on the list. Her first two books – "Tortilla Sun" and "The Storm Runner" – also made the prestigious list.
Cervantes, who writes books for children and teens, said she's humbled at the distinction.
"Writing for kids is about more than entertainment," she said. "You hold their minds, and often hearts, in your hands. So to know that my books are being widely read is not only a dream come true but a responsibility I take seriously.
Cervantes said she has been an avid reader since a young age and was inspired by her youngest daughter to take up writing.
"I always say that I didn't go looking for writing, that writing found me. My youngest daughter inspired the first story I ever wrote which ended up being my first book, 'Tortilla Sun,'" she said. "When I first began to create stories, I had no idea I was writing a book. So, this journey – like that book – has been sequential. I have been fortunate to meet some incredible mentors along the way, to find the right resources at the right time, to venture to writing retreats where I pushed the limits of what I thought I could do as a writer."
Rick Riodan presents "The Fire Keeper" is a sequel to "The Storm Runner" which is based on Maya mythology and follows the story of a young New Mexican boy named Zane Obispo and his three-legged dog named Rosie. Zane spends every day exploring the sleeping volcano in his backyard he calls "The Beast," which is the one place where he can be himself and escape other kids who make fun of him for having a limp and walking cane. In the story, Zane meets with colorful characters inspired by Maya mythology.
The "Fire Keeper," introduces spirited new characters, sneaky gods, Aztec royalty, unlikely alliances and dark secrets – secrets that will change Zane forever.
The third book in the series, "The Shadow Crosser," will be released sometime in 2020.
Cervantes is the second author to publish under Rick Riordan Presents, a Disney-Hyperion imprint, headed by Riordan, best-selling author of the "Percy Jackson" series.
In addition to the "Storm Runner" series, Cervantes also has another project up her sleeves.
"I am working on a project that I can't talk about yet but that will hopefully be announced soon," she teased.
Cervantes' books can be purchased anywhere books are sold. For information, visit her official website at https://www.jennifercervantes.com/.
Set in New Mexico Cervantes, a San Diego native, attended the University of New Mexico where she met her husband, Joseph Cervantes, who is a state senator and last year ran for governor.
Jennifer Cervantes said New Mexico is the perfect backdrop for her book because its vast and open beautiful rural spaces that offer many adventures.
"I love New Mexico because of the energy and mysticism that's found in the beauty of our landscape that reminds me how big the universe is and how small we really are," Cervantes said.

Democracy, economic fairness and not taxing the rich

Texto completo: For the Monitor
It is true, the wealthiest 1% of the world population is as wealthy as the remaining 99%. The wealthiest 0.1% of the world population is as wealthy as the bottom 90%. People mistakenly think this is a modern phenomenon, that it was better in the past. They are dead wrong, and it is getting worse. This is why we, a Democrat and a Republican, have joined together to write this article.
Power and money have always been controlled by the tribal chief, king, emperor, Wall Street barons and their pals. Democracy is a very recent (less than 300 years old) system that has produced great wealth, but inequality still exists. So, the solution to inequality is not taxing the rich.
The poor will always be poor if they earn only hourly wages or a low salary. To get rich, the poor need the tools of the rich – capitalization, unearned income streams and ownership of the businesses where they work. Provide them with those tools and they can prosper like the Alaskan natives did.
How did that happen? It started with a political success that led to a great reduction in poverty and increase in equality in the Alaska population.
While serving as a U.S. senator from Alaska, Democrat Mike Gravel created fundamental tools for wiping out poverty among the indigenous tribes by capitalizing 200 enterprises owned by the poor, which have produced $150 billion in revenues since 1976 and made 200,000 Natives financially set for life.
Former Alaska governor Jay Hammond, a Republican, created the Alaska Permanent Fund referendum, which captured 20% of all Alaska oil revenues for the fund. It has grown to about $80 billion and continues to deliver $1,000 per capita annually to all Alaskans since 1976.
This made Alaska one of the top three states in economic equality by household wealth (meaning the gap between rich and poor is the smallest) and for reducing poverty. You would think this model would be imitated everywhere but for political reasons – corruption, ideology, ignorance, etc. – it was not.
We need a U.S. Permanent Fund that invests some of its money in a growth fund to create more capital, and invests the rest in people, families or groups of families in small and medium-sized enterprises with business plans to guide them and grow. The Alaska enterprises are the model, but we can devise better ones in 2019 because a lot has been learned since the 1970s.
The solution is not a wealth tax as called for by Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. It is a permanent investment in the U.S. Permanent Fund. The solution is not a tax cut. Eighty-two percent of the $1 trillion tax cut of 2017 went to the top 1%. It was demoralizing to hard-working Americans.
If the richest 0.1% invested 2% of their wealth per year in the U.S. Permanent Fund, in 10 years $5.5 trillion would be available to invest in U.S. working-class households. The Trump base would disappear along with its resentments about the browning of America, because everyone would be rolling up their sleeves, getting to work and making money.
“Over the last three decades the wealthiest 1% of Americans saw their net worth grow by $21 trillion, while the wealth of the bottom 50% fell by $900 billion,” the New York Times reported on June 24. How can a democracy (where everyone is supposed to be equal) survive that fact?
The U.S. Permanent Fund could distribute some earnings per capita annually, but its real value is that of a development bank – run by those who invest in it, loaning money to Americans at the bottom to middle of the wealth scale (the Permanent Fund can loan at the prime rate or lower and all its earnings from loans pour right back into the fund itself for new funds). This will make it easier for Americans at all levels to develop business plans for small enterprises than to get a mortgage or a credit card (which are both losers in the long run for borrowers). The U.S. Permanent Fund could wipe out working-class resentment (and populism) in a matter of years, without raising taxes on the rich.
If you agree with this, demand every candidate running for president read this op-ed, including the president. Call upon the billionaires to form a commission (non-governmental) that includes people of all walks of life to form and manage the U.S. Permanent Fund and help provide business plans for eager, hard-working Americans.
Economic prosperity can be brought to the middle and lower classes without taxing the rich, and it gets done in a way that satisfies both Republicans and Democrats.

Texto completo: In 1969, Donald Fisher was a 40-year-old real estate professional who had a big problem finding Levi's that fit him properly. His solution became the Gap.
Fisher and his wife, Doris, opened the first location of the retail chain on Ocean Avenue in San Francisco, a short walk from the state university campus. For three months, the new store, named by Ms. Fisher in a nod to the generation gap, sold Levi's, especially in difficult-to-find sizes, and records. The store soon dropped the vinyl. As Mr. Fisher told The San Francisco Chronicle, "The pants were selling the records, not the other way around."
But even after the Jefferson Airplane longer-length vinyls disappeared from the shelves, a loose association with the counterculture continued to serve the chain for the next 25 years. As it grew into a corporate behemoth, the Gap's carefully engineered link with a generation of rebellious young people helped make the company into a definitive clothing brand of the American century's final quarter.
The wares sold by the Fishers were snatched up eagerly upon the store's opening. Levi's was one of the hottest brands in the country. Within the year, the Gap had opened a half-dozen other locations. Its nascent brand identity was visible in its advertising, which tried to speak the language of the tuned-in. Ads promised "Levi's for cats and chicks" and bragged of "tasty plaids," "wild bells" and "far-out jeans."
Actual hippie teenagers may have smirked at the copy, but it was eye-catching, as were the store's broad selection and low prices. Four years after the company was founded, there were 36 locations, bringing in $ 14.7 million in sales (more than $ 85 million in today's dollars). The following year, the Gap began selling its own label. In 1976, it went public -- just in time for the world to change again.
By the late 1970s, a denim price war was underway and, over all, demand for jeans was slowing. The pendulum was swinging decidedly back toward the formal.
So in 1983, Mr. Fisher brought in someone with a broader view of what the Gap could be: the Bronx-born Millard Drexler, called Mickey by those who know him.
Mr. Drexler had long held a dream of the perfect merchandise slate. "I listed on a piece of paper everything I would want to carry in this company that I was going to start. That eventually became my Gap job," he said in a recent interview.
With the arrival of Mr. Drexler -- who soon became known as the "merchant prince" -- came the pocket tees, the khakis and the sweaters that would signal an end to the brand's youth.
"The vision was casual, cool clothes at really good prices," Mr. Drexler said. "I thought that there should be a point of focus. Casual, great colors, good prices. It was all about style. And clearly Gap didn't have it."
The stores were redesigned. Well-known artists like Miles Davis, Marilyn Monroe, Jack Kerouac, Pablo Picasso and Andy Warhol appeared in advertisements, linking creative iconography to the Gap heritage. The Gap's acquisition of Banana Republic in 1983 began to pay dividends, and the first GapKids opened in 1986. (The Gap's original customer base was, by then, well into their parenting years.)
By 1986, The New York Times was already calling the transformation driven by Mr. Drexler "one of the most remarkable turnarounds in retailing history." Five years later, The Times reported that the Gap's clothes were the second most popular in the United States behind Levi Strauss.
"That was a defining moment," said the Gap archivist Erin Grady, who works as a sort of corporate historian at the company's headquarters in San Francisco, cataloging past ad campaigns, store imagery and other ephemera. "We looked at our identity and became who we are today."
With business success came cultural ubiquity. And with that ubiquity came widespread contempt.
In a recent interview, Thomas Frank, the author of "The Conquest of Cool: Business Culture, Counterculture, and the Rise of Hip Consumerism," confessed that it had been some time since he had thought about the Gap and "the mysterious union it once achieved with my generation's sartorial taste."
Still, an old theory of Mr. Frank's applied.
"Artists and rebels turned out to be the ultimate consumers," he said. "Or rather, in the Gap's case, the ultimate icons for consumerism. We're talking about a society that uses the language of dissent to sell this really bland lifestyle."
The company that had identified itself with flower children had begun to wilt into corporate anonymity.
Even those whose brand was bland were moved to remark on Gap's hegemony. The columnist Peggy Noonan noted in 1992 that Republicans and Democrats alike were "Gapped, linened and Lancômed." And in a cross-generational attack, the 1994 Gen-X classic "Reality Bites" portrayed a gig at the Gap as the ultimate sellout job.
Three years later, the company temporarily rebranded the New York Stock Exchange, outfitting traders in khakis -- which in 1997 were still forbidden on the trading floor.
"We said, 'What is the symbol of business? It'd be really cool to take on the symbol of business, one that hasn't gone casual.' And we said, the New York Stock Exchange," a Gap executive told The Times that year.
But the company's presence on the stock exchange was also a sign that the Gap had become safe, conservative and profoundly uncool. As Mr. Frank pointed out, the "rebellion against middle-class style" had become mainstream. Nonconformity had become less an ideology than an aesthetic, one to which everyone could safely conform.
Mr. Drexler exited in 2002. (He drove a period of rejuvenation at J. Crew before stepping aside in 2017; he is now working with his son on Alex Mill, a fashion brand resembling a kind of luxe Gap.) Mr. Fisher died in 2009.
The Gap has struggled in recent years. In February, it announced a plan to spin off Old Navy into a separate company. Its second-quarter results were disappointing; Art Peck, its chief executive, said in August that the company was dealing with a "challenging environment."
The generation that grew up with the Gap has aged; they may have enough basics to be getting on with. And casual clothing isn't hard to come by these days. In helping to define the world's uniform informality, the Gap helped make its strategy obsolete.
Ms. Grady, the Gap archivist, is 28. She did not grow up shopping at the company's stores, and only really became familiar with the brand when she started work. In a conversation about pop culture touchstones in the company's history, she mostly reached back, mentioning Mick Jagger's outfit at the 1985 Live Aid concert and Alicia Silverstone's sweater in the 1995 movie "Clueless."
But there was a highlight from 2019. She spoke proudly of the Gap's role in the new season of "Stranger Things." Several scenes take place at the store, including a montage of the show's eager teenagers shopping there. The season, released this summer, is set in the year 1985.

Rachel Madley: Does anyone really ‘love’ their private health insurance?

Texto completo: Twenty minutes after I learned I had Type 1 diabetes — after narrowly avoiding a diabetic coma — a nurse pulled my parents away from my bedside and urged them to call our insurance company immediately. If they didn’t call right away, she warned, insurance would not cover the stay. At that moment — now 10 years ago — my parents had to choose whether to comfort their sick and frightened 14-year-old daughter, or spend hours on the phone with our insurer. Of course, they left me to make those calls, and my nightmarish relationship with the insurance industry began.
Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that destroys the body’s ability to produce insulin or maintain normal blood-sugar levels. There are no days off from this illness. Without careful monitoring and daily insulin injections, Type 1 diabetics risk blindness, kidney failure and death.
On top of the full-time job of monitoring blood sugar, American diabetics and their families have to work a second shift fighting insurance companies to cover their care. Even though my parents had insurance and both worked multiple jobs, the hospital bills, insulin and supplies drove them into debt, forcing them to forgo insurance, and medical care, for themselves.
When I turned 19, I was kicked off my parents’ plan. I took out thousands of dollars in extra student loans to buy insulin and diabetes supplies. After the Affordable Care Act passed, I was able to regain insurance, a high-deductible plan that cost me hundreds of dollars for each doctor’s visit and insulin refill.
So when I hear politicians talk about how much Americans love their private health insurance, I think: Really?
I am alive today not because of insurance companies but despite them. My insulin refills have been delayed countless times, not because of medical reasons, but because of what seem to be arbitrary insurance limits and requirements to continuously document my condition, which is permanent. Once, my insulin refill was delayed so long that I ran out, just when the insurance office closed for a three-day weekend. I was a student, away from home, with no other way to pay for my prescription. Terrified, I rushed to the pharmacy in tears. The pharmacist took pity on me and slipped me a vial of insulin without charge, saving my life.
The worst part about my story is that it isn’t unique, at least not in this country. Young adults with Type 1 diabetes suffer life-threatening diabetic ketoacidosis — a complication caused by insufficient insulin — at much higher rates in the United States than in Canada. Canada’s single-payer system provides seamless, lifelong coverage. But in the United States, diabetics must wage war with insurance companies to get the care we need, if we have insurance at all.
I’m glad that politicians are finally talking about health care reform. But those who only want to “protect” the Affordable Care Act or add a public option to our already byzantine mix of private and public plans are missing the point. Americans don’t “love” their private insurance, as many of them claim. They’re grateful for any coverage at all. Americans love their doctors, nurses and pharmacists, because those are the people who save our lives.
What diabetics — and all Americans — need is care that is lifelong and portable, covers all medically necessary services and drugs, and is accepted by all doctors and hospitals. Only a single-payer version of “Medicare for all,” in which care is publicly funded by one entity and privately delivered, would guarantee coverage to everyone in the United States, and eliminate the greed and administrative waste of private insurance.
It has been 10 years since my diabetes was diagnosed. I can’t help but think about the doctors and nurses who cared for me with such skill, my parents who sacrificed their needs for mine and the pharmacist who kindly slipped me that vial of insulin. I’m alive today because of them.
Will I have to live the next 10 years holding my breath through every doctor’s visit, praying that insurance will approve my medication, and in time? Will I ever be able to stop my endless fights with insurance middlemen? I know I’ll never live a day without worrying about my health. But maybe one day I, and millions of other diabetics in America, can live without worrying about how to pay for it.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON-- On the same day that the Department of Homeland Security added violent white supremacist extremism to its list of terror threats for the first time since the agency's creation after the 9/11 attacks, a controversial African American conservative commentator told Congress that “white nationalism is not a problem that is harming” communities of color in America.
Candace Owens, who has previously dismissed white nationalism and has said Hitler was “OK” until he “had dreams outside of Germany”, downplayed the threat of white supremacy at Friday's hearing during her testimony before the House Oversight Joint Subcommittee
Owens told lawmakers that "based on the hierarchy of what’s impacting minority Americans, if I had to make a list of 100 things, white nationalism would not make the list. ”
“White supremacy and white nationalism is not a problem that is harming Black America,” she continued.
Owens continued to blame violence on hostility towards masculinity, black-on-black crime, abortion rates, and illegal immigration.
But, her comments came around the same time the DHS added white supremacist violence to its list of priority threats in a revised counter-terrorism strategy.
Kevan McAleenan, the acting Homeland Security secretary, said Friday during remarks at the Brookings Institution in Washington that the “continuing menace of racially-based violent extremism, particularly white supremacist extremism, is an abhorrent affront to our nation, the struggle and unity of its diverse population, and the core values of both our society and our department. "
He continued to explain that after the alleged El Paso shooter “sought to kill Hispanics, and his online manifesto was rife with references to multiple hate-based ideologies,” McAleenan said he was even more confident that DHS needed a new counter-terrorism strategy.
“In our modern age, the continuation of racially-based violent extremism, particularly violent white supremacy, is an abhorrent affront to the nation,” he also said.
Owens recently left the post of communications director for Turning Point USA, a conservative organization that aims to organize college students. She pushed for more African Americans to vote Republican, arguing Democratic policies have hindered, rather than helped, the black community.
She was invited to testify at the hearing about confronting white supremacy by Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, who ceded his time to her after Democrats mostly skipped over her during the discussion. Jordan is a prominent member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus.
Owens went onto say that white nationalism is “just election rhetoric,” echoing her earlier testimony on Capitol Hill in April and told lawmakers they should instead focus on “God and religion and shrinking government. ”
“It's 'Days of Our Lives' in here, and it's embarrassing,” she said concluding her testimony.
FBI Director Christopher Wray told Congress in July that the bureau had recorded approaching 100 arrests of domestic terrorism suspects in the previous nine months and most of those investigations of that kind involve some form of white supremacy.
There were 1,020 known hate groups in the country in 2018, the fourth straight year of growth, the New York Times reported earlier this year, citing the Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors extremism in the U. S. Hate crimes, meanwhile, rose 30 percent in the three-year period ending in 2017, the Times also reported, citing FBI figures.

Texto completo: Three famous UFO videos are real, the Navy says – but please call the mysterious objects "UAPs" not "UFOs. "
Joseph Gradisher, spokesperson for the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Information Warfare, confirmed the videos' content to USA TODAY Friday morning. Gradisher referred to the objects depicted in the videos as “unidentified aerial phenomena” or UAPs.
The Navy's definition of UAPs includes unidentified objects that are likely easily explained – such as drones – as well as more mysterious phenomena that have stumped many observers and experts.
UAP incursions in pilot training areas are frequent, according to Gradisher, and they have become more frequent since the public use of drones in 2014. He declined to say how many occur within a given time.
John Greenewald – founder of The Black Vault, which describes itself as a database of government secrets and projects – said this was the first time the Navy openly admitted that UFOs, or UAPs, exist. Black Vault reported on the Navy's position earlier in September.
The government's position on UFOs has recently been referenced in media reports, including in June when President Donald Trump told ABC News' George Stephanopoulos that he didn't "particularly" believe in UFOs.
"I think the takeaway that is most powerful is that the Navy is willing to go on the record to say that they're not only aware of UAPs, but that they are tracking them and still don't have a clue of what they are," Greenewald told USA TODAY on Thursday.
While there is a certain openness to identifying UAPs, Gradisher said the videos were never meant to be publicly released.
'Storm Area 51': An encounter outside Area 51 is imminent. This rural Nevada sheriff is ready.
What UFO videos?
The three videos that Gradisher addresses are commonly known as the "FLIR1," "Gimbal" and "GoFast. "
The "FLIR1" and "Gimbal" were published by The New York Times and To The Stars Academy of Art and Science in December 2017, although Gradisher said the video was first leaked on the Internet in 2007 and discovered by the Navy in 2009.
Greenewald said "FLIR1" took place off the coast of San Diego, while the "Gimbal" is speculated to have taken place somewhere in Florida.
The final video "GoFast" was published by To The Stars Academy in March 2018.
UFO, UAP: What the Navy has to say
The Navy has not only confirmed the existence of UAPs, but it also offered an explanation of the term.
"It provides the basic descriptor for the sightings/observations of unauthorized aircraft/objects that have been observed entering/operating in the airspace of various military-controlled training ranges," Gradisher told The Black Vault.
'Storm Area 51': Earthlings descend on Area 51 for aliens, parties
The Navy spokesman told USA TODAY that the more he talked about the UAPs, the more pilots are willing to come forward to report these events as they can present a threat while flying.
Gradisher said "UAP" is not a new term within the Navy but is preferred over "UFO" because of cultural stigmatization. He believes using "UFO" discourages pilots from reporting incidents for fear of being ridiculed.
The spokesman said reporting incursions on the training area is important not only for aviators' safety but also the security of combat tactics.
"If they’re in the training scenario as if they’re in a real-time combat situation and something comes at them, it’s a hazard," Gradisher said. "It’s also a security challenge; we don’t want our tactics to be observed. "
He also said that UAPs reported by pilots are presently being investigated for positive identification and involve a number of government agencies including the Department of Defense, intelligence agencies, the Air Force, FAA and more.
Additionally, the spokesman confirmed that these events happen in other military training areas as well – not just with Navy pilots.
The Navy's statement says the videos were never publicly released, as To The Stars Academy had originally claimed, and are considered leaked instead.
To The Stars Academy declined to comment.
Gradisher says the Navy is unlikely to investigate the possible leaker, or leakers, of the "FLIR1" video, as it may have come from at least different 5,000 people.
What Greenewald says is most important about this discovery is that, although the Navy is willing to be open about UAPs, there's still a level of secrecy.
“There are such encouraging things behind (the Navy's statement) and discouraging things behind it," Greenewald said. "And we have to find out who the heck to believe. "
States with the most UFO sightings: Vermont leads the way
Blink-182 and UFOs: What's the connection?
To The Stars Academy of Arts and Science was co-founded by former Blink-182 band member Tom DeLonge, who rejoiced on his Instagram over the Navy's decision to openly recognize UAPs.
"The @tothestarsacademy team has been working tirelessly in Washington to move the subject of UAPs past stigma and toward acceptance," he wrote in his post. "Facts are starting to replace unsubstantiated claims and the fog that has masked the reality of UAPs is clearing. WE ARE MAKING REAL PROGRESS – I AM SO EXCITED!!"
DeLonge is listed on the organization's website as Co-founder, Chairman of the Board and Interim CEO.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- President Trump said on Wednesday night that "it's crazy" that the United States spends about $ 13 million a year for each terrorism suspect held at the detention center at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, and added that he would search for alternatives.
"I know about that," Mr. Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One as he flew back to Washington after a three-day campaign trip to New Mexico and California. "I think it's crazy. It costs a fortune to operate, and I think it's crazy."
But he would not say whether he would consider closing the prison at Guantánamo. "We're looking at a lot of things," he said without elaborating. Instead, he pointed out that his predecessor tried and failed to shutter the prison. "Look, President Obama said that Guantánamo Bay would be closed, and he never got it done."
The president's comments came in reaction to a report in The New York Times tabulating the expense of housing the 40 prisoners remaining at Guantánamo, who include the men accused of plotting the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. According to the report, the government spent more than $ 540 million last year to hold the prisoners, including pay for the military guards, the cost of the war court and related construction expenses.
The cost of $ 13 million per prisoner almost certainly makes the detention facility at Guantánamo, which was set up by President George W. Bush's administration in the months after 9/11 and became a public relations liability, the world's most expensive prison.
[ Read The Times's report : Set up nearly 18 years ago, the prison on the remote naval base has grown into what appears to be the most expensive on earth.]
By comparison, it cost American taxpayers in 2012 just $ 78,000 per inmate at the "supermax" federal prison in Colorado, where some of the nation's most dangerous prisoners are kept and where some officials in the past have suggested transferring the Guantánamo detainees.
Mr. Bush sought to reduce the population before leaving office and released about 540 detainees, mostly transferring them to home countries like Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Mr. Obama vowed during his 2008 presidential campaign to close Guantánamo, and his administration released another 200 through a similar approach.
But Mr. Obama was blocked by Congress from transferring the remaining detainees to any federal prison in the United States amid resistance to the idea of bringing terrorists to American soil. And when Mr. Trump ran for president in 2016, he vowed to keep Guantánamo open and even to send more terrorists there, although none have actually been added to the prison since he took office.
In his comments to reporters on Wednesday night, Mr. Trump focused more on what to do with prisoners captured during the war with the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq and still held by the United States in the Middle East. The president has demanded that European allies take those prisoners who originally came from their countries. He repeated his threat to release them at the borders of those nations if they do not.
"The big decision we have now is we have thousands of people," Mr. Trump said. "They came from other countries. We want those countries to take them back. We did them a big favor by stopping them. If they came from France, we want France to take them and to try and do whatever they have to do with them. But that's a very expensive situation."

Deferred Action For Immigrants Set to Resume

Texto completo: In a policy reversal, the Trump administration said it would allow some immigrants to avoid deportation while undergoing lifesaving medical treatment.
In a policy reversal, the Trump administration on Thursday said it would resume a program that enabled some immigrants to remain in the country without fear of deportation while undergoing lifesaving medical treatment.
The unannounced termination last month of much of the so-called deferred action program generated public outrage and drew sharp rebuke from the medical establishment. Among those ordered to leave the country in 33 days or face deportation was Maria Isabel Bueso, who had been involved in clinical trials that led to the approval of a drug to extend the lives of those with her rare genetic disease.
Last week, Ms. Bueso and other young immigrants with serious illnesses told a House Oversight subcommittee that their survival depended on staying in the country, and pleaded for reinstatement of the program.
The Department of Homeland Security informed the House Oversight Committee on Thursday that, at the direction of Kevin McAleenan, the acting secretary, it would resume consideration of requests for deferrals. A spokesman for the United States and Citizenship Immigration Services, which had originally rescinded the program, confirmed the decision.
Ms. Bueso and others had received letters in August from the agency, which adjudicates immigration benefits, notifying them that their requests to remain in the country had been denied. That drew criticism from lawyers, Democratic lawmakers and doctors, who said their patients were being issued a death sentence.
A few weeks later, the government said it would reopen the cases of those who had received denials, sending them letters to that effect. However, it did not tell them whether their requests had been granted or clarify how other applicants should proceed. It said only that cases would be considered by another agency, Immigration and Customs Enforcement. But that agency, which oversees deportations, told The New York Times that it had not been consulted and was not prepared to take on the role.
Representative Ayanna S. Pressley, Democrat of Massachusetts, sponsored a letter signed by more than 120 members of Congress demanding answers from homeland security. She then called for an emergency oversight hearing about the elimination of the program.
On Thursday, Michael Anderson, president of Benioff Children's Hospital at the University of California, San Francisco, where Ms. Bueso receives weekly treatment, said, "We hope this will apply to every patient who requires lifesaving care, including our patient Isabel Bueso and other children in her situation."
Ms. Bueso, who has an enzyme disease that causes dwarfism and other physical deformities, has remained in the country since she was 7 to receive treatment and participate in additional medical studies; she has renewed her deferred action status every two years. Her parents pay for private health insurance to cover her care.
"While we have not received any official confirmation that our deferred action case will be approved," Ms. Bueso said, "we are cautiously optimistic about this news."

Texto completo: Our guide to plays and musicals coming to New York stages and a few last-chance picks of shows that are about to close. Our reviews of open shows are at nytimes.com/reviews/theater.
Previews & Openings
'ADRIENNE TRUSCOTT'S (STILL) ASKING FOR IT' at Joe's Pub at the Public Theater (previews start on Sept. 20; opens on Oct. 3). Subtitled "A Stand-Up Rape About Comedy" (plus some more words that aren't publishable), this update of the cabaret performer's 2015 show approaches gendered violence and toxic masculinity with savage wit and a surprising number of brassieres. Bring your own rape whistle! Ellie Heyman directs.
212-967-7555, publictheater.org
'DUBLIN CAROL' at the Irish Repertory Theater (previews start on Sept. 20; opens on Oct. 1). Before Conor McPherson's "Girl From the North Country" transfers to Broadway, audiences can catch the Irish Rep's revival of this drama, which made its stateside debut at the Atlantic Theater Company in 2003. Set on Christmas Eve, the spare, talky play stars Jeffrey Bean as an undertaker's assistant muddling through a hangover and an encounter with his estranged daughter (Sarah Street). Ciaran O'Reilly directs.
212-727-2737, irishrep.org
'THE HEIGHT OF THE STORM' at the Samuel J. Friedman Theater (in previews; opens on Sept. 24). Having already introduced New York to "The Mother" and "The Father," the French playwright Florian Zeller brings another familial tempest to Broadway. Jonathan Pryce and Eileen Atkins reprise the roles they played in London, those of a long married couple, one of whom might be dead. Jonathan Kent directs.
212-239-6200, manhattantheatreclub.com
'THE LIGHTNING THIEF' at the Longacre Theater (previews start on Sept. 20; opens on Oct. 16). What do you do when you learn that you're actually the son of a god? Apparently, you go to Broadway. Joe Tracz and Rob Rokicki's 2014 musical, based on Rick Riordan's Percy Jackson novels, about a kid who discovers he has a very fancy family tree, has moved uptown. Stephen Brackett directs.
212-239-6200, lightningthiefmusical.com
'MOTHERS' at the Duke on 42nd Street (in previews; opens on Sept. 25). The mommy wars turn unusually violent in Anna Moench's drama for the Playwrights Realm. The competition among moms (and one nanny and one dad) at a baby meet-up is already pretty brutal, but when disaster rolls in, sniping and backbiting give way to real danger. Robert Ross Parker directs.
646-223-3010, playwrightsrealm.org
'OUR DEAR DEAD DRUG LORD' at WP Theater (in previews; opens on Sept. 24). As slumber party games go, making Bloody Mary appear in the mirror is one thing; summoning the spirit of Pablo Escobar is next level. In Alexis Scheer's new play, produced by WP Theater and Second Stage Theater, teenage girls try to invoke their favorite narco-terrorist. Whitney White directs.
212-541-4516, wptheater.org
[Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.]
'RUNBOYRUN' AND 'IN OLD AGE' at New York Theater Workshop (in previews; opens on Sept. 23). Having previously presented "Sojourners" and "Her Portmanteau," New York Theater Workshop presents two further plays in Mfoniso Udofia's nine-part "The Ufot Cycle," which follows a Nigerian couple across generations and time. Loretta Greco directs "Runboyrun"; Awoye Timpo directs "In Old Age." Chiké Johnson and Patrice Johnson Chevannes star.
212-460-5475, nytw.org
'SOFT POWER' at the Public Theater (previews start on Sept. 24; opens on Oct. 15). A metatheatrical exploration of politics and culture and a riff on "The King and I" as seen through a trick mirror, David Henry Hwang and Jeanine Tesori's musical of a sort arrives at the Public. It conjures a world in which a Chinese businessman meets Hillary Clinton at a campaign fund-raiser, an experience that inspires a hallucinatory blockbuster show. Leigh Silverman directs.
212-967-7555, publictheater.org
'SUNDAY' at the Atlantic Theater Company at the Linda Gross Theater (in previews; opens on Sept. 23). Having conquered the wizarding world in "Harry Potter and the Cursed Child" and having grappled with a giant ape in "King Kong," the playwright Jack Thorne joins a book group. In this new play, directed by Lee Sunday Evans, a group of friends meets to discuss fact and fiction.
866-811-4111, atlantictheater.org
'THE SWIMMER' at the Minetta Lane Theater (Sept. 26-28). The distance swimmer Diana Nyad plunges into the Minetta Lane in Audible's latest theatrical collaboration. In her stage debut, directed by Jane Anderson, Nyad recounts her 111-mile swim, sans shark cage, from Cuba to Florida. Nyad's coach and friend, Bonnie Stoll, also appears.
audible.com/ep/minettalane
'WHITE NOISE' at the N.Y.U. Skirball Center for the Performing Arts (Sept. 20-22). With his masterly deconstruction of "Oklahoma!" now serving chili and cornbread to Broadway audiences, the director Daniel Fish turns to another American classic: this novel by the postmodernist Don DeLillo. The actor Bruce McKenzie performs several of the book's obsessive lists, with live accompaniment from the drummer Bobby Previte.
nyuskirball.org
Last Chance
'EUREKA DAY' at Walkerspace (closes on Sept. 21). Colt Coeur's production of Jonathan Spector's infectious comedy about a vaccine debate at a private day school ends it run. Ben Brantley wrote that under Adrienne Campbell-Holt's direction, the early scenes tend toward an easy satire, but the play as a whole "winds up engaging you on a much deeper, more compassionate level."
coltcoeur.org
'MAKE BELIEVE' at the Tony Kiser Theater at Second Stage Theater (closes on Sept. 22). Bess Wohl's mysterious, moving play about four siblings, adrift as children and equally unsettled as adults, puts away childish things. Jesse Green described the two-act show, which stars Samantha Mathis, Susannah Flood and Brad Heberlee and is directed by Michael Greif, as "a rich and moving contemporary drama."
212-246-4422, 2st.com
'SEA WALL/A LIFE' at the Hudson Theater (closes on Sept. 29). Make sure you have handkerchiefs at the ready for the final performances of Simon Stephens and Nick Payne's twinned one-acts about love and life, which star Tom Sturridge and Jake Gyllenhaal. In an admiring review, Laura Collins-Hughes described these plays, directed by Carrie Cracknell, as "the most stripped-down storytelling on Broadway right now."

Texto completo: Flooding from Tropical Storm Imelda on Thursday left hundreds of people trapped in their homes and cars; led to water rescues, a hospital evacuation and power outages; and closed entire school districts, according to officials and local media. At least two people died in the storm's floodwaters, including a 19-year-old man trying to move his horse, according to media reports.
On Thursday evening, the Harris County sheriff's office tweeted that another man died after being submerged in his vehicle.

The flooding in southeast Texas drew comparisons to Hurricane Harvey, which dumped more than 50 inches of water on parts of the Houston area and southeast Texas two years ago. According to the Weather Channel, Imelda became the continental United States' fifth-wettest tropical cyclone. It dropped more than 41 inches in some areas, compared with Harvey's highest rainfall total of 60.8 inches. Still, parts of the state have been inundated worse than they were two years ago.
"What I'm sitting in right now makes Harvey look like a little thunderstorm," Chambers County Sheriff Brian Hawthorne told ABC13.
Residents of rural Jefferson County, especially its western half, were inundated with rainfall that in some areas far exceeded what was forecast, a National Weather Service meteorologist told the Beaumont Enterprise. The paper also reported that about 200 people fled to a city shelter in downtown Beaumont and that Interstate 10 was closed because of flooding.
Gov. Greg Abbott declared a state of emergency Thursday morning due to flooding in more than a dozen Houston-area counties.
The declaration gave affected counties access to state resources as they continue to respond to the flooding. The governor deployed resources, including water rescue squads, to the area Monday in preparation for the storm, according to the release.
“The State of Texas is working closely with local officials and emergency personnel to provide the resources they need to keep Texans safe from Tropical Storm Imelda,” Abbott said in a statement. “I thank our first responders who are acting swiftly to help the communities that are facing this severe weather event. I urge all those in the path of this storm to take the necessary precautions and heed all warnings from local officials.”
A Houston Metro bus is underwater at George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston.
The counties included in the disaster declaration are Brazoria, Chambers, Galveston, Hardin, Harris, Jasper, Jefferson, Liberty, Matagorda, Montgomery, Newton, Orange and San Jacinto.
A mandatory evacuation order was issued at 9:30 a.m. Thursday for Pinewood Estates, Countrywood Estates and Rose Hill Acres, areas north of Beaumont, according to weather.com.
Local residents posted photos on Twitter that showed water reaching close to their knees and covering the tires of standing cars.

Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner advised in a tweet Thursday morning that if people were in a safe place, like work or school, they should stay in place for the next three to four hours until the area is more clear of water.
Freeways in the Houston area flooded, Houston police Chief Art Acevedo said in a tweet. George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston also announced it was at a "full ground stop."
Colby Croom, a volunteer, ventured into the storm with a boat to help rescue people in the Beaumont area, he told The New York Times. Croom's cellphone was overwhelmed with calls Thursday morning. There were times when more than 10 people reached out to him in the span of a minute.
Croom helped several families escape their homes since the morning, he told the Times.
“I’ve seen water over rooftops,” he said. “I’ve seen vehicles stalled out. Man, it’s kind of like the Harvey deal all over again.”
The Houston Chronicle reported that the storm's "sudden swing-back" caught people by surprise and left many stranded at work or on flooded streets and highways. Parents in the region were angry that at least 20 school districts remained open Thursday, the paper reported.
Many parts of Houston and southeast Texas still have not fully recovered from Harvey. And areas that didn’t flood in that catastrophic storm were hit hard by Imelda.
In 2017, Harvey swept across the Gulf of Mexico, becoming a Category 4 hurricane before it slammed into the tiny coastal town of Rockport. From there, the storm slowly moved across the state and dumped historic amounts of rain across a wide swath of southeast Texas.
Harvey’s flooding damaged or destroyed hundreds of thousands of homes. Damage estimates surpassed the $100 billion mark, and more than half a million families sought disaster relief aid. State and federal officials used the damage, which became the biggest housing recovery in modern history, as a chance to rewrite the nation’s disaster playbook. But many said those attempts slowed aid and made Texans guinea pigs.
Harvey hit Texas less than a year after a joint investigation by The Texas Tribune and ProPublica reported that unchecked development in and around Houston created short-term economic gains while increasing flood risks for homeowners and businesses. Meanwhile, climate change is only expected to bring more frequent and fierce rainstorms to the region.
Harris County voters approved a historic $2.5 billion bond package last year to finance an array of flood control projects in the Houston area. And in their first legislative session after Harvey, Texas lawmakers agreed earlier this year to draw $1.7 billion from the state’s savings account to fund repairs and flood control projects.
Although a previous version of Senate Bill 7 would have appropriated more than $3 billion from the state's savings account, that figure changed as lawmakers negotiated budget proposals. The legislation was part of a trio of disaster relief bills that Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick identified as a priority this legislative session. It establishes two funds that would provide grants and loans for flood control and mitigation projects. Imelda comes weeks before Texas voters will decide in a constitutional election whether to create one of those funds, the Flood Infrastructure Fund.

Texto completo: The fall TV season was already way too overwhelming, what with its tidal wave of brand-new shows.
And now Disney and Apple are both poised to leap into the streaming pool as if your attention (and wallet) weren't strained enough.
How can anyone possibly keep up?
That's where we come in. To help narrow your focus and prevent your DVR from suffering a stroke we've laboriously sifted through all the fresh fare from the broadcast networks, cable channels and streamers to uncover 10 gems that are worth your while.
Keep in mind that in most cases we've seen only the pilot episode and, in a couple of cases, just preview clips. So some of our picks could fall short of expectations. But for now, these are the shows listed in the order of their premiere dates that have us most excited:
Stumptown' (ABC)
Cobie Smulders ("How I Met Your Mother") gets her chance to be a kick-butt leading lady in this well-paced action drama based on a graphic novel. She plays Dex Parios, a brash, sharp-witted Army veteran who now works as a private investigator in Portland, Oregon.
Dex leads a rather complicated life. She has a brother with special needs to take care of, and, meanwhile, she's suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and a gambling addiction.
Smulders brings the character to life with plenty of charismatic swagger, spirited banter and cardio-intensive stunts. She's aided by an impressive cast that includes Jake Johnson, Michael Ealy and Camryn Manheim. Buckle your seat belt and enjoy the ride. (10 p.m. Sept. 25)
The Politician' (Netflix)
Netflix forked over a gigantic pile of cash to lure iconoclastic producer Ryan Murphy ("Glee," "American Horror Story," "Pose") into its tent. Was it worth it?
Murphy's first series for the streaming titan follows Payton Hobart (Ben Platt), a wealthy student at a fancy private high school who, since the age of 7, has obsessed about occupying the Oval Office. Entitled and spoiled, he's determined not to let anything and we mean anything get in his way, starting with a shady campaign for student body president.
The series contains all the usual Ryan Murphyisms snarky one-liners, a satirical sting, hot-button topics and a tone that veers from earnest to outrageous. Award it bonus points for getting Gwyneth Paltrow and Jessica Lange to join the fun. (Sept. 27)
Evil' (CBS)
San Jose native Robert King and his wife, Michelle, the masterminds behind "The Good Wife" and "The Good Fight," venture out of the courtroom to dabble in a chilling psychological mystery.
The series follows a skeptical forensic psychologist (Katja Herbers, "Westworld") who joins a priest-in-training (Mike Colter, "Luke Cage") as they investigate the Catholic Church's backlog of unexplained mysteries, including supposed miracles, demonic possessions and hauntings. Michael Emerson ("Lost," "Person of Interest") is also on board.
Network television could use a few more squirm-inducing scares and "Evil" delivers on that front. But it also serves up some doses of humor that make the show creepy in a fun sort of way. (10 p.m. Sept. 28)
Back to Life' (Showtime)
This offbeat British comedy, which first aired on the BBC, has been compared by some to the darkly hilarious hit "Fleabag." That's a high bar to reach, but it has lots of fun trying.
Like "Fleabag," this six-episode series follows a woman (Daisy Haggard) struggling with existential angst. In this case, she's fresh out of prison after serving 18 years for murder. (Did we mention it's a comedy?) Now she's trying to lead a normal life in her lovely but claustrophobic seaside hometown, where the mystery of her past hangs in the air.
Of course, problems abound some in the form of foul neighbors who want her gone. You'll cringe almost as much as you laugh. (8:30 p.m. Oct. 6)
Nancy Drew' (The CW)
The iconic mystery book character who was introduced to readers in 1930 comes to prime time with a contemporary, CW-style makeover. Think "Riverdale" with its attractive teens, romantic entanglements and lots of moody intrigue.
Newcomer Kennedy McMann is both appealing and convincing as the brilliant young sleuth who works troubling criminal cases, including one in which she's a prime suspect. She gets plenty of help from her posse of pals in Horseshoe Bay, Maine. And in a neat bit of casting, Pamela Sue Martin TV's original Nancy Drew appears in the pilot episode as a psychic. (9 p.m. Oct. 9)
Modern Love' (Amazon Prime)
The popular New York Times column (and podcast), which features reader-submitted essays about relationships, marriage and dating, is the inspiration for this star-studded, instantly addictive anthology series.
Among the high-profile performers appearing in season 1 are Tina Fey (as a wife in a rocky marriage), Anne Hathaway (a bipolar woman looking for love) and Cristin Milioti (a single book critic who bonds with the doorman of her building). Also dropping by are John Slattery, Dev Patel, Catherine Keener, Emmy Rossum and Andy Garcia, among others.
Executive producer John Carney sifted through the Times' archive of 700-plus essays to come up with eight stories that range from uplifting to heart-wrenching while exploring love in all its complex and fascinating forms. (Oct. 18)
Watchmen' (HBO)
Writer-producer Damon Lindelof ("Lost," "The Leftovers") has never been afraid to take big, bold creative swings. Here he reimagines and updates an acclaimed graphic novel in a way that might tick off some of its die-hards, but nevertheless promises to be a mind-blowing piece of television.
His complex saga takes place some 30 years after the events of the comic book and is populated by new characters. It's set in an alternate America where Robert Redford is president (yes, really) and police officers (including Regina King and Don Johnson) wear masks to hide their identities amid a raging terrorist threat from a group of white supremacists.
The ultra-dense pilot episode is a challenge, but packs the kind of emotional heft and hypnotic visuals that leave you hungry for more. (9 p.m. Oct. 20)
Mrs. Fletcher' (HBO)
Kathryn Hahn is always a joy to watch and this wry midlife character study is no exception.
Adapted by Tom Perrotta ("The Leftovers") from his own novel, the series follows Eve Fletcher, a bashful, empty-nest single mother in her mid-40s who opens herself to new experiences after her son Brendan (Jackson White) goes off to college. New experiences like internet porn and a creative writing class.
Meanwhile, her once very popular jock son finds college a daunting challenge as he struggles to make connections with his more socially and politically aware fellow students. Score one for mom. (10:30 p.m. Oct. 27)
The Morning Show' (Apple TV+)
Jennifer Aniston ("Friends") and Steve Carell ("The Office") return to television in this juicy drama series that explores the high-stakes world of daybreak news, along with the bloated egos and ruthless power plays that go with it.
Aniston plays a morning-show host who deals with the messy fallout after her longtime co-host (Carell) is fired for sexual misconduct (shades of Matt Lauer). Enter Reese Witherspoon, who plays a fiery local TV reporter who gets invited for a job interview and a shot at the big time.
The series, which promises to delve deeply into #MeToo issues, includes Billy Crudup, Mark Duplass and Gugu Mbatha-Raw among its impressive cast. But will it be enough to get you to subscribe to yet another streaming service? (Nov. 1)
The Mandalorian' (Disney+)
Disney is trying to make a big splash as it enters the streaming fray with the first-ever live-action "Star Wars" TV series.
"Game of Thrones" veteran Pedro Pascal plays the title character a mysterious, armor-clad gunfighter who hails from Mandalore (the home of bounty hunter Boba Fett) and works in the outer reaches of the galaxy. Pascal will be joined by Giancarlo Esposito ("Breaking Bad," "Better Call Saul"), Gina Carano ("Deadpool"), Carl Weathers ("Rocky") and Nick Nolte.
Written by Jon Favreau ("Iron Man"), "The Mandalorian" is set after the fall of the Empire and before the emergence of the First Order, which would place it somewhere between "Return of the Jedi" and "The Force Awakens." The series will appear in weekly doses, rather than the binge-'em-all method. (Nov. 12)

Brad Smith began his career at Microsoft in 1993. Aside from serving as its president, he is the company's chief legal officer and the co-author of a new book, "Tools and Weapons: The Promise and the Peril of the Digital Age." Andrew Ross Sorkin, DealBook editor and columnist for The New York Times, interviewed Mr. Smith at The Times's first DealBook/DC Strategy Forum. The following excerpts have been edited and condensed.
The world of technology and Silicon Valley now feels like it's in the cross hairs of Washington and regulators in a way that it has never been before. And the question I have for you is, having lived through the past 10, if not 20, years and the turnaround of Microsoft and everything else, I imagine you get phone calls and you see other executives at rival companies. I'm thinking of Facebook and Apple. I'm thinking of Google and I'm even thinking of your neighbor, Amazon. When you see people like Jeff Bezos in Seattle, what do you tell them? How do you get in front of this? What would you say, given your experience, that they should be doing?
I think that there's a few things that we'll always need to think about. I think the first thing you have to step back and think about is: Why is this company in this situation? And to a very large degree it's because technology has become a tool and a weapon. It is creating rise to so many broad societal concerns. I think the hardest thing for anybody in this position is you have to step back and you have to look yourself in the mirror and not see what you want to see but what other people see. I think you have to acknowledge the problems, because until you acknowledge the problems, you can't solve them, and nobody is going to believe that you're trying.
Right now, Silicon Valley is in a very defensive posture. I think that's probably fair to say. There was an article in The New York Times just this week about whether Apple was placing its own apps higher in the App Store than everybody else's. Which, by the way, I think you could make the parallel with some of the issues that Microsoft was dealing with when it comes to the web browser war back in the day. To acknowledge up front that, yes, we've done this and it's a problem, does that create more of a problem or not?
It does both. Having lived through it in the '90s, having been a lawyer, being still a lawyer, at least in part of what I do, you really have to take very carefully all your advice from the lawyers. That's the first thing I would say because there's actually a real tension between a statement that a lawyer will say will constitute an admission and saying things that, frankly, everybody knows to be true and puts you on the path to solving a problem. And as I argue inside Microsoft anytime such issues arise, in the long run you're better served by solving the problem than by trying to win a lawsuit.
Chris Hughes, who's famous and one of the founders of Facebook, wrote an Op-Ed and is now, I believe, working with the Department of Justice arguing that Facebook should be broken up. And part of his argument isn't just the monopoly issue, it actually relates to privacy. And I believe that his viewpoint is even broader than just Facebook itself. It's all of big tech. What do you think of that, well, in terms of the way we look at antitrust in America today?
I think it's a really important question, and I'm not here or anywhere else advocating that anybody be broken up or sued for that matter. I do think one of the more interesting developments in antitrust law has been people -- first from a scholarly perspective and now the head of the Justice Department Antitrust Division -- embracing a broader approach. For many years, the prevailing theory was that the only kind of harm that mattered, that was relevant in the world of antitrust, was purely economic harm, which fundamentally tended to relate either to driving people out of business or preventing them from entering or prices rising, with prices being the ultimate test. And this new school of thought, which I think is a logical one, is that actually, given the role of technology in society, we do need to think about the impact on our privacy. We need to think about it in terms of the impact on our democracy perhaps more than anything else. And so there is more in the world of antitrust than economics alone.
You had a meeting with President Obama in the Oval Office in 2013. You write about it. But I think it's probably worth sharing blow by blow to the room. He effectively said this was coming for Silicon Valley. What happened?
Well, it was a fascinating meeting. It was in December of 2013, just basically a week before the holidays, and it brought together just over a dozen of the tech leaders, the household names people everybody would recognize. And it was all about the Snowden disclosures. And we were there for a very particular purpose, which was to make the case to President Obama, Vice President Biden, the senior staff at the White House, that there needed to be more checks and balances on the data that was in the hands of the National Security Agency.
And you know, as tended to happen, people went around the room and there was a moment when President Obama, in addition to listening very thoughtfully and frankly having issues, made a different point. He said, "I have a suspicion that the guns will turn." He said, "All of you have more data about people than the government does, and the kinds of demands that you are making on the government when it comes to privacy will eventually be made on you." I wrote it down because I thought at the time that it was prescient.
And as we say in the book, in a way, Cambridge Analytica in 2018 became the Three Mile Island for data and privacy and technology -- meaning suddenly people woke up and almost overnight the political climate changed.
So here's my next tech question: What do you think it means to be a patriotic company in America today? And the reason I asked this question is because we have a number of big tech companies that have said, we don't want to do business with the government. And I'm thinking of Google on Maven . You've seen the protests at Amazon. You, by the way, are participating in a project with Washington State, I believe, on facial recognition that some people would consider controversial. So where is the line, and when is a company supposed to say, I'm doing this with the government or I'm not?
It is a fundamental question that I don't think is something one answers with a singular approach to everything. But I can give you a very concrete example that reflects how we thought about it. We asked ourselves what would we provide to the Pentagon, and the answer is everything we make. We feel it is our responsibility as an American company to ensure that people who are literally putting their lives at risk to defend our country have the best technology that we can create for them. But that's Step One. Step Two is we've also said in a democracy, like this one, we have a voice. We have a corporate voice, and it is right that we think about the broader ethical and policy issues that the use of technology in the military can raise. What does it mean to deploy artificial intelligence for weapon systems? These are fundamentally important questions for the future, and so we said we would engage, we would think, we would meet, we'll be public. And I think that, in our view, is the right approach in the democratic nation.
Let me ask you this: You also write about an experience where an adviser to President Trump talks to you, I think, about using Microsoft to spy elsewhere in the world, to which you say no. What happened?
Well, this relates to another aspect of what it means to be thoughtful in a democratic nation. First of all, we all live and are fully committed, I think, to the rule of law and the protection of certain liberties that are enshrined in our Constitution and the Bill of Rights. And, you know, those rights are not rights that are enjoyed by Americans alone. There are certain fundamental rights, human rights, that, in fact, are enshrined in a global set of principles and even documents that have been endorsed by our own government. So what we've also made clear in a wide variety of contexts is, even for our own government, or for that matter for any government, we won't voluntarily sacrifice the human rights of our customers. We have to put that first above all else.
O.K., but let's speak to that, because on one end you're willing to give the technology over to the Pentagon. On the other end, we had the situation with Apple and San Bernardino several years ago and the phone that the government desperately wanted to be opened, and you took the side of Apple.
Well, first of all, I would say what this really points to is two distinct things. There is access to technology, and there is access to people's data. We create technology. We are prepared to provide it to the United States government. There may be times that if the U.S. uses technology in a way that we think runs afoul of the law, we will use our voice. We sued the Obama administration four times over the surveillance issues. Now, when you get the people's data, the first principle is -- unlike the technology we create -- the data that people store in our cloud does not belong to us. We are not the owner of it. It is their data. It is our customers' data, and our first responsibility in our view is to ensure that their rights and their data are preserved.
Let me make it a little more complicated. You have a founder named Bill Gates who is very anxious about the issue of encryption. He is very worried, talks quite openly and has implied, at least, that he was not necessarily on board with the view of Microsoft when it came to that Apple phone, and he has real concerns that in a world where everything is end-to-end encrypted -- when Facebook encrypts its entire system -- that actually it's creating an even bigger problem.
First of all, you're absolutely right that there's a variety of views. You know, there's a thorny set of questions around encryption that will continue to merit thoughtful conversation. There are certain propositions that we would sign up for readily, and then there are aspects for which there should be more conversation. For us, the right answer is not to create back doors. I've said before, the path to hell begins at the back door of a software product, because if you create that, you basically undermine people's security and privacy.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: What's Streaming
ANIARA (2019) Stream on Hulu; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. This sci-fi drama from the directors Pella Kagerman and Hugo Lilja is based on a downbeat 1956 poem by the Swedish Nobel laureate Harry Martinson. Like its source material, the movie tells a story that is, despite being about humans traveling beyond the confines of earth's atmosphere, supremely claustrophobic: It centers on a spaceship knocked off course, out of fuel and running out of hope. The crew of the ship, which had left an earth in environmental ruin and was bound for a human colony on Mars, includes MR (Emelie Jonsson), the story's protagonist, whose situation becomes increasingly grim. "At times, the commitment to bleakness feels artistically admirable," Teo Bugbee wrote in her review for The New York Times. "The film unblinkingly faces the void, and it refuses to console the audience, which has come along for the ride. But mostly, this is a movie that simulates the experience of losing the will to live, a daunting premise even for the bravest voyagers."
CLIMATE FORUM 2020 Stream on NBC News Now. Following a town hall on global warming held for Democratic presidential candidates earlier this month by CNN, the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service, MSNBC, the environmental news service Our Daily Planet and New York magazine will host a climate forum at which several candidates will have further opportunity to communicate their views on how to address the issue of climate change. Those scheduled to be in attendance include Senators Bernie Sanders and Cory Booker, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., the former housing secretary Julián Castro, Andrew Yang and Marianne Williamson. The town hall begins livestreaming on Thursday at 10 a.m. EST and will continue on Friday.
THE CHEF SHOW Stream on Netflix. For all those who have ever dreamed of watching Seth Rogen cut up a full chicken: Great news! You'll be able to see that happen within the new set of episodes of this cameo-heavy cooking and travel show, which is hosted by the director Jon Favreau and the chef Roy Choi. The new episodes also include a stop at the experimental Los Angeles taco spot Guerrilla Tacos, a lesson in oyster harvesting in Northern California and a visit to Skywalker Ranch in Marin County, Calif. There, the pair visit an on-site garden at which Favreau (who is behind the upcoming Star Wars series "The Mandalorian") holds out a freshly plucked purple carrot, eliciting a quip from Choi that tidily shows off the pair's friendly chemistry: "It's like lightsaber color."
What's on TV
RETURN TO DOWNTON ABBEY: A GRAND EVENT 8 p.m. on NBC. Many die-hard fans of "Downton Abbey" are likely planning to spend Thursday night at movie theaters, where a film based on that popular PBS historical drama will start hitting screens. Fans who want to continue building the hype instead can opt to watch this hourlong hors d'oeuvre, which features behind-the-scenes interviews with the "Downton Abbey" cast and chats with celebrity fans of the series.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III of Massachusetts plans to announce on Saturday that he is challenging Senator Ed Markey for the Democratic Senate nomination in their state, setting up a titanic generational clash next year between an heir to the state's foremost political dynasty and the longest-serving member of its congressional delegation.
Mr. Kennedy informed Mr. Markey of his plans today, according to a Democrat familiar with their discussion who spoke on the condition of anonymity to relate a private conversation. Mr. Kennedy, the grandson of Robert F. Kennedy, will announce his candidacy in a modest, East Boston neighborhood before embarking on a statewide tour.
The contest will almost certainly be the country's most high-profile Senate primary and could offer clues for just how eager Trump-era Democrats are to replace more incumbent lawmakers. But unlike with some of the Tea Party-era Republican races between ideological foes, Mr. Kennedy, 38, and Mr. Markey, 73, are both reliable progressives and each is claiming support from liberal leaders and organizations.
Initial polling indicates that Mr. Kennedy would begin the contest as the front-runner. And some Massachusetts Democrats -- uneasy about the prospect of a fractious, yearlong primary contest -- had hoped that Mr. Markey would take a hint and bow out after word of Mr. Kennedy's interest in the seat first leaked last month.
But Mr. Markey, who was first elected to the House in 1976, made clear again Wednesday that he intends to run for re-election.
"I'm going to run in all of the issues that I have been fighting for today and into the future: climate change, income inequality, a woman's right to choose and on gun safety legislation," Mr. Markey told reporters in the Capitol after The Boston Globe revealed Mr. Kennedy's intentions, adding: "The response I have been getting across the state has been absolutely terrific."
Mr. Markey's senior campaign adviser John Walsh made no mention of Mr. Kennedy in a prepared statement, but did note that "elections are about choices." In an interview last month, Mr. Markey emphasized his lengthy legislative record and blue-collar roots, previewing how he'd run against his younger, more affluent colleague.
Massachusetts has been riveted by the prospect of a Kennedy-versus-Markey showdown since August, after a report by The New York Times found that the political scion had begun telling senior Democratic officials that he was considering taking on Mr. Markey and had in fact commissioned a poll testing his prospects against the incumbent. Each Democrat has over $ 4 million in the bank for the campaign.
Some in Washington and Boston were skeptical that Mr. Kennedy would go through with the race, finding his calculation to be out of character for a young lawmaker who has sought to avoid controversy since being elected to the House in 2012. And Mr. Markey scrambled to lock down support, including from perhaps the most prominent Democratic primary challenger of 2018, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, with whom he introduced the Green New Deal legislation.
But as Mr. Kennedy began traveling far from his southeastern Massachusetts district in recent weeks, it became clear he was serious about confronting Mr. Markey. And with a long roster of Massachusetts Democrats rising through the state's political ranks, it became clear that running against Mr. Markey may prove to be his best chance to join the Senate where his grandfather and great-uncles, Edward M. and John F. Kennedy, once served.
A handful of Massachusetts Democrats began sounding notes of regret for getting behind Mr. Markey after it became clear Mr. Kennedy may run. But one leading figure in the state party said Wednesday she was remaining by the senator's side.
"I endorsed Ed Markey last February," said Senator Elizabeth Warren. "I couldn't ask for a better partner in the United States Senate."
But Ms. Warren, who taught Mr. Kennedy at Harvard Law School, noted that she has "known Joe since long before he got into politics."
And asked if he was wise to pick this fight, she said: "I have no criticism."

Texto completo: Hong Kong • Pay attention to Hong Kong. The three months of protests here speak volumes about the state of democracy today — how the human quest for freedom can’t be snuffed out, even by the most powerful autocratic systems, and how hard it is to turn that quest into lasting change in the age of Twitter when everyone is a leader, a follower, a broadcaster and a critic, and compromise becomes nearly impossible.
Yes, Hong Kong reminds us that people — God bless them — have both bodies and souls. And the great mistake that autocrats regularly make is thinking that they can thrive indefinitely by feeding just the first and not the second.
While the Hong Kong protests have been fed by many grievances, including income gaps and shortages of affordable housing, the hot molten lava of this volcano is that many Hong Kongers self-identify as free men and women and they viscerally reject the ruling bargain the Communist Party has imposed on mainland China and would like to impose on Hong Kong: To get rich is glorious, but to speak your mind is dangerous.
Why do Hong Kongers feel compelled to assert their identity as a free people now? It’s because anyone who visited China over the last 30 years knows that it is so much more open today than it was three decades ago — and it is so much more closed today than it was five years ago.
The anticipated and hoped-for trend toward more openness in mainland China has been aborted and reversed since Xi Jinping came to power in 2013, when he cracked down on both corruption and even mild dissent, and then, in 2018, made himself president for life.
That unmistakable cold breeze from Beijing, where people now don’t even whisper dissent, with cameras and microphones everywhere, has wafted down to Hong Kong. And the youth here in particular are pushing back with a don’t-think-for-a-second-that-you-can-bring-that-muzzle-here ferocity. That’s not who we are!
One protest banner said it all: “Sorry for the inconvenience. We are fighting for the future of our home.”
Bonnie Leung, a Hong Kong district counselor and an activist in this protest movement that proudly proclaims that it has no leader, put it to me like this: When Hong Kong was directly ruled by Britain, a democracy, “we knew their political system and that they were just not sharing it with us. With China, we know their system and we want protection from it. We can’t live in a society where people like Liu Xiaobo” — the Chinese Nobel Peace Prize winner and democracy activist — “could be arrested and die in jail.”
After a decade of democracy being snuffed out around the world, Hong Kong is part of a fragile but unmistakable counter-trend seen in places like Russia and Turkey, where people are using any sliver of freedom of expression or vote to push back on the humiliation of being silenced or bought off by dictators. Just when you think people’s souls have been crushed, they’ll still surprise you.
But working against that is another global trend apparent here: the contradictory effects of social networks on political movements. Facebook and Twitter make it much easier to get lots of people into the streets fast. But when everyone has a digital megaphone, it is much harder for any leader to aggregate enough authority not just to build a coherent set of demands but, more important, to make compromises on them, at the right time, to transform street energy into new laws.
So, the Hong Kong protesters proudly proclaim they have “no leader” and insist on their five crowdsourced demands — and “not one less.” Those demands include universal suffrage to elect the city’s administrators, an investigation of police brutality and amnesty for arrested protesters.
But no movement will get 100% of what it wants, especially in Hong Kong, which is actually one country, three systems. There’s Beijing, the sovereign power. There’s the conservative pro-Beijing Hong Kongers, who dominate the local administration and accept the limited democracy rules inherited from Britain. And there’s the more urbanized, full-democracy-aspiring, internet-savvy youth in the streets.
The only possible outcome is a compromise. But as South China Morning Post columnist Alex Lo argued in a Sept. 11 article, Hong Kong protesters are being hobbled by the same social networks that got them their large crowds: Because there is no leadership, there is no ability to cut a deal, and anyone who tries to compromise will get torched online. These modern movements are crowdsourced but also crowd-enforced, and that’s intimidating for anyone who wants to make a deal.
“Worldwide trends usually take a few years to reach Hong Kong,” wrote Lo, and “our social media-driven revolution that has fueled the current unrest is no exception. ... But from Gezi Park in Istanbul to Tahrir Square in Cairo, revolutions and rebellions driven by social media have all ended in failure.”
Because Hong Kong’s protests “encompass and amplify practically every major grievance people have about their government, society and China,” Lo added, “it’s impossible to bridge disagreements and present a viable political program. The only common denominator, the lowest, is that everyone hates China.”
My view: Social networks and cybertools are making inefficient authoritarian regimes more frail, because the people now have more tools to communicate and take on the state. See: Egypt, Jordan, Turkey and Russia. But they’re making efficient authoritarians even more efficient. See: China. And they are making democracies ungovernable, because they facilitate not only the “end of truth” but also “the end of compromise.” See: America, Brexit and Hong Kong.
To compromise means, at a maximum, to forge new common ground, to find areas of overlap, where opposing sides can stand together and, at a minimum, each side takes a little less of what it wants in order to just coexist. But both are becoming harder under the intense pressure of online-enabled extremists.
As my New York Times colleague Keith Bradsher has noted, the last time major street protests in Hong Kong broke out was in September 2014 — ironically after an Aug. 31, 2014, decision, approved by Beijing, to give the people of Hong Kong more say in how they chose their leaders.
At that time (and still today), a 1,200-member electoral committee, stacked with Beijing loyalists and more conservative farmers, businessmen and fishermen, chose the city’s chief executive. Beijing proposed on Aug. 31, 2014, to shrink that committee’s power to only choosing the candidates who could run — so no one overtly hostile to Beijing could take office — but then allowing all Hong Kongers to vote on the candidates.
It was not an awful compromise because even if Beijing controlled what names would be on the ballot, whoever would win the voting would likely be candidates who promised Hong Kongers the most democracy. In the current system, the winner of the most votes among the chosen 1,200 electors is often whoever makes the most promises to Beijing to twist the arms of Beijing’s friends in Hong Kong.
The compromise was rejected by the street in 2014 and it set off a two-month occupation of several Hong Kong neighborhoods, known as the “Umbrella Movement.” It demanded a “one man, one vote” system, with no obstacles on who could run — the only way to truly protect Hong Kong’s unique democratic identity.
I have huge admiration for the courage of Hong Kongers to defend their city’s unique character. But my head says that “perfect” is rarely on the menu and that better is good when facing an overwhelming power like Beijing. Imagine that the Aug. 31, 2014, compromise had been accepted. Mainland Chinese would be watching Hong Kongers vote directly for their leaders — albeit from a limited list — compared with mainlanders who can’t do even that.
“By insisting on all or nothing, the pan-democrats squandered a good opportunity to bring Hong Kong closer to the ‘true democracy’ to which they rightfully aspire,” observed Hong Kong investor and writer Weijian Shan, the author of “Out of the Gobi, My Story of China and America.”
Had Hong Kongers accepted the Aug. 31, 2014, offer of limited universal suffrage they’d be in a much stronger position today to demand the full deal. Now it’s unclear if Beijing or its Hong Kong allies will offer even this limited universal suffrage — or if this democracy movement could compromise on it.
So, when the tear gas smoke clears, two huge questions will still linger. Is “better” — the 2014 compromise — still on the table? And, if it is, is there a protest leadership that can say yes to it and make it stick?

Texto completo: The continued attacks on Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh represent another low in American politics.
The New York Times’ Opinion section on Sunday carried a story labeled “news analysis” that repeated an unsubstantiated story about alleged sexual misbehavior by Kavanaugh when he was a college freshman in 1983.
Soon afterwards, an “editor’s note” added that the woman who supposedly was the victim of the alleged indecent exposure declined to be interviewed and that her friends say she does not recall the incident.
Oh. Never mind.
Never mind, except that a number of the Democratic presidential candidates had already called for Kavanaugh to be impeached and removed from office based on the “analysis.”
The Times story was based on an upcoming book by two Times reporters about Kavanaugh’s brutal confirmation process. The authors reported that this story had been told to the FBI by former classmate Max Stier, and they included it because it was similar to another allegation that Kavanaugh had denied. However, in the book, the authors noted what the Times story omitted: that the woman had declined to be interviewed and her friends said she didn’t recall the incident.
The Washington Post said it independently confirmed last year that the FBI and lawmakers had been told about the second accusation against Kavanaugh but didn’t run the story because the woman involved would not be interviewed and no witnesses were identified.
Even assuming good faith in being concerned about the accusations against Kavanaugh, the knee-jerk calls for impeachment are reckless coming from candidates who seek to be the next president of the United States.
Of course, if the evidence ever matched the rhetoric against Kavanaugh, there would be something to talk about. But that’s yet to happen. We should all expect better from the press and aspiring presidential candidates.
There’s no doubt that Democrats are unhappy that President Trump’s nominees will shape the federal judiciary for decades to come. But in attempting to discredit a Supreme Court justice by repeating unsubstantiated and lurid stories, they are discrediting only themselves.

Texto completo: La Administración Trump está sopesando la posibilidad de aumentar drásticamente los precios que los migrantes pagan en las cortes para apelar sus casos de deportación o para solicitar la ayuda de un juez que reconsidere sus reclamos en los tribunales.
Los mayores afectados serían los migrantes que se encuentran detenidos por el Servicio de Inmigración y Aduanas (ICE , en inglés) y los que fueron devueltos a México para esperar por la resolución de sus peticiones de asilo en tribunales estadounidenses.
Según documentos obtenidos por la web informativa BuzzFeed News, los oficiales solicitaron que los migrantes paguen $975 dólares por la apelación de un fallo de un juez de inmigración y $875 dólares para solicitar que un caso sea reabierto o reconsiderado por la Junta de Apelaciones de Inmigración.
Actualmente, el precio para ambos procesos está instituido en $110 dólares cada uno. La nueva medida podría influir sustancialmente en la manera en que los inmigrantes apelan la decisión de los jueces en los casos de deportación .
Algunos expertos también consideran que un gran número de migrantes verían reducidas sus opciones para solicitar protección o un estatus legal.
“Están esencialmente privando a las personas del derecho a apelar, eso es mucho dinero. Es un aumento sustancial de las tarifas que está fuera del alcance de las personas “, explicó la ex jueza de inmigración en San Francisco, Rebecca Jamil.
De acuerdo con BuzzFeed News, el Departamento de Justicia no quiso hacer comentarios al respecto, pero varios oficiales señalaron que los costos de los procesos no habían aumentado desde 1986 y que, si lo hacían era, se debía a un abarrotamiento en las cortes del país.
“La administración no ha puesto énfasis en el debido proceso de los inmigrantes: estas tarifas parecen estar a la luz de ese patrón. Creo absolutamente que esto disuadirá a las personas de tomar decisiones atractivas, incluso si son injustas “, señaló Sarah Pierce, analista de políticas del Instituto de Política Migratoria.
Bajo la actual administración de Donald Trump, los casos de apelación se incrementaron hasta 30,000 durante el año fiscal 2018 .
Un artículo de The New York Times reveló que en el mes de las cortes de inmigración tenían más de 800,000 casos pendientes, lo que significaba que se necesitaba un promedio de 700 días para procesar cada uno de ellos.
Si se aprueba, la medida no se haría efectiva de inmediato, puesto que las regulaciones requieren de un periodo de discusión de 60 días.

Obesity Stigma And Yo-Yo Dieting, Not BMI, Are Behind Chronic Health Conditions, Dietitian Claims

Texto completo: In a recent New York Times opinion column, dietitian Christy Harrison, an “intuitive eating coach” and author, responded to a fellow clinician who had questioned some of her thoughts on the link between being overweight and developing other medical conditions.
Harrison noted that although most health professionals have been taught that higher body mass index (BMI) causes poor health outcomes, she wrote, “unfortunately, that just isn’t true.”
She added: “We have a host of issues associated with high B.M.I.s. But correlation doesn’t prove causation, and there’s a significant body of research showing that weight stigma and weight cycling can explain most if not all of the associations we see between higher weights and poor health outcomes.”
We decided to investigate the point she was making, which is at the center of a larger, often-heated debate about whether it is possible to be overweight and healthy at the same time — a perspective advocated by the “Health at Every Size” movement, of which Harrison is a part. With nearly 72% of U.S. adults considered overweight or obese, this is a pressing issue.
When we reached out to Harrison to find out the basis of her statement, she responded quickly, citing two papers as her main sources.
The first, a 2011 piece published in the Nutrition Journal, argues it might be better to shift away from weight-loss efforts to improving health in other ways that are weight-neutral.
Its lead author, Linda Bacon, a professor at the University of California-Davis, wrote “Health at Every Size: The Surprising Truth About Your Weight,” a 2010 book embraced by “fat acceptance” advocates.
It addresses Harrison’s first point with this: “While it is well established that obesity is associated with increased risk for many diseases, causation is less well-established.”
The other paper, a 2014 piece in the Journal of Obesity, makes similar arguments.
Causation, Correlation, Association: Let’s Unpack That
There is an old saw used by most statisticians: Correlation does not equal causation.
But what does that mean? Let’s use a fake example: Some people have trouble seeing at night. Turns out all those people ate carrots. Ergo, there could be a correlation between eating carrots and night vision problems.
That doesn’t prove anything else, though, such as causation. Correlation is necessary when trying to determine causation, but doesn’t prove it.
“Epidemiological studies never show causation, only association,” said Dr. Samuel Klein, director of the Center for Human Nutrition at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.
To establish cause, epidemiologists need more evidence.
The best way, considered the “gold standard,” is to randomly assign people to one group or another ― feeding one group carrots and withholding carrots from the other. Researchers would then monitor any difference in how many people develop night vision problems.
That’s nifty, but not always possible or ethical. One could not, for example, randomly assign some people to a group and then cause them to become overweight.
Instead, researchers use different types of studies, such as those that compare groups of people who already have the characteristic — say, carrot eating or being overweight — with those who don’t to see if patterns emerge.
They use methods to control for things that might affect the results, such as age, gender, income level, whether a person smokes and other factors. Then they can estimate how strong of an association or correlation they see.
With smoking and lung cancer, very strong associations were seen, leading to the conclusion that, yes, smoking causes lung cancer. But does excess weight cause other health conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, cancer, sleep apnea or joint problems?
“With the case of weight, the associations are much weaker,” said Kendrin Sonneville, assistant professor of nutritional sciences at the University of Michigan School of Public Health.
So on this point, Henderson’s statement holds up. Current scientific research supports a correlation between being overweight and suffering poor health outcomes, but it does not definitively establish causation.
But others, especially clinicians, say there is little doubt that being overweight strongly raises the risk of developing such health problems.
“This isn’t up for debate,” said Dr. Harold Bays, chief science officer for the Obesity Medicine Association, which represents practitioners who treat overweight patients.
“The overwhelming amount of clinical and scientific data supports obesity as a disease, both as a direct and indirect contributor to a large number of adverse metabolic and other health consequences,” he said.
A 2018 Endocrine Society scientific statement, for example, looked across many studies of overweight and obesity, concluding that the two contribute to “type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, some cancers, kidney disease, obstructive sleep apnea, gout, osteoarthritis, and hepatobiliary disease, among others.”
Then things get murky.
Bays and the other experts agreed that some people who are overweight might not develop other conditions.
“It is absolutely true that not all cases of diabetes, hypertension, cancer and fatty liver are due to obesity,” said Bays.
They acknowledged that people who fall into the category of being obese or overweight may even appear healthy metabolically — at least for a while.
But there’s also a caution.
“If you say, ‘Wait a minute, is their blood sugar where we want it … aren’t their triglycerides a little high and what about their blood pressure?’ And that’s not even to mention pain to the joints or sleep apnea,” Bays said. “When you drill down, very few people would truly meet the criteria of being metabolically healthy but obese, and if you follow them for five or 10 years, now the majority are going to have something.”
What About The Stigma?
There’s been less research around Harrison’s second point: that most, if not all, of the diseases associated with being obese or overweight are caused instead by the stigma heavy people face, or the yo-yo effect of dieting, losing weight and then gaining it back again, in regular cycles.
She pointed to research included in the paper by Bacon reporting that weight cycling could lead to hypertension, or high blood pressure. The research, however, found associations though not specific causation.
Similarly, in another study Harrison provided, people who reported weight discrimination ― 6% of the sample studied — had twice the risk of physiological stress over nearly 10 years. Such stress can be associated with Type 2 diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease, the study said.
But most of those we spoke with strongly disputed the sweeping statement that so many chronic conditions can be caused by stigma and weight cycling.
While those two things can factor into health problems, they are not responsible for most of the health outcomes seen by her patients, said Dr. Fatima Cody Stanford, an obesity medicine physician and an assistant professor of medicine and pediatrics at Harvard Medical School.
Stanford also takes issue with advocates who promote the idea that being overweight isn’t a big health risk factor.
“The Health at Every Size movement goes against what we know about obesity as a disease,” Stanford said. “Their aim in that movement is to not learn the science.”
Our Ruling
Harrison said the notion that a higher BMI causes poor health outcomes “just isn’t true” ― adding that “we have a host of issues associated with high BMIs. But correlation doesn’t prove causation, and there’s a significant body of research showing that weight stigma and weight cycling can explain most if not all of the associations we see between higher weights and poor health outcomes.”
On a strict reading of the science, she has a point. It is very difficult to prove definitively what causes disease, and showing “correlation” is a different finding than causation. However, she appears to apply this standard selectively, using it both to undermine the relationship between high BMI and poor health outcomes, and as evidence of how weight cycling and stigma are linked to certain chronic health conditions.
But in the case of obesity, researchers in multiple studies nationally and worldwide have shown definite links between being overweight and developing diseases, such as diabetes, and conditions, such as painful joints. There is far less evidence for the role that weight stigma and yo-yo dieting has in the development of those medical problems, although the experts urge continuing research into those questions.
We rate Harrison’s statement as Mostly False.

Texto completo: A couple of items on the education front caught my attention over the past month.
The first was a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed written by Glenn Sacks, who just happens to be co-chairman of the Los Angeles teachers’ union. In his article, Sacks argues that the success of charter schools is all an illusion, essentially, arguing they are cooking the books.
Sacks acknowledged that charters’ outcomes are superior to those of traditional public schools. But he attributes this disparity not to the quality of the schools or teachers, but to “self-selection” — that the students in the charter schools are themselves inherently more likely to succeed by the simple fact that their parents sought a better education for them.
Sacks uses as an example the magnet school he teaches at: “Our magnet accepts everybody, as any public school does, but its students outperform residential students in practically all areas, including standardized tests, participation in extracurricular activities, and college admissions and scholarships.”
So far, so good, but Sacks continues, “What separates them from the residential school’s students is self-selection — they applied to a magnet. Yet that’s a big difference. The pursuit of a school of choice is evidence of a student’s and a family’s commitment to education.”
It’s a little tough to decipher Sacks’ point, but it would seem his assertion is that children with parents who are committed to their education ought to just suck it up and accept relegation to substandard schools for the sake of egalitarianism. He’s not the only one taking this type of approach.
The same day, the New York Times reported that New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio’s school task force recommended, among other things, the elimination of “most selective admissions and all gifted and talented programs.” The contention was that such programs were exclusionary and elitist, catering only to, well, gifted and talented students at the expense of less talented students. De Blasio said as much when he recently stated that the testing of four-year-olds for gifted programs was “a real concern.”
Elimination of gifted and talented programs is, thankfully, a bridge too far for even the NYC teachers’ unions, but it is fully compatible with what many on the Left see as the goal of education. They deem the purpose of schooling not the passing on of knowledge or even the training of an individual necessary to be a contributing member of society — but instead believe our school system ought to pursue the nobler aim of social leveling.
Both the NYC task force recommendations and the usual criticisms made against charter schools illustrate the pernicious lust within the educational establishment for homogenization. The concept of individual excellence is at best a secondary consideration, at worst it is increasingly seen as an immoral enabler of inequality.
At about the same time, Roger Kimball wrote an interesting piece in which he explored the idea that a key feature of socialism is incuriosity regarding individuals, or as he put it, “its ingrained, indeed programmatic, lack of curiosity about other people.”
It’s one of those things perhaps so obvious as to be rarely noticed, even more rarely commented upon. Socialism, in whichever of its multitudinous forms, is concerned with civilizations and communities as a forest, and is necessarily uninterested, except in a most abstract sense, with the individual trees.
The individual — whose goals, desires, and, yes, abilities, may differ from his or her neighbor’s — is the natural antagonist of the collective. If the goal is levelling, a homogenized society where absolute equality is the ultimate ambition, the pursuit of individual excellence doesn’t have much of a place.
It may seem counterintuitive for the educational establishment in this country to harbor at its core an antagonism for any reform that may allow for greater outcomes than the media, but it just goes to show how far the concept of education itself has changed, to our childrens' detriment.

Fake outrage over Ben Shapiro shows why people need to stop taking Media Matters seriously

Texto completo: When I logged into Twitter yesterday and saw “Ben Shapiro” trending, I braced myself for one of two possibilities: Either the conservative commentator put his foot in his mouth, or, more likely, the pretend journalists at Media Matters for America had once again sparked faux outrage by misrepresenting something he said and stripping it of all context.
Naturally, it proved to be the latter.
The controversy started when Shapiro discussed the recent rehashing of the sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, and like most conservatives, took a critical view. This isn’t exactly a radical position, seeing as the latest woman presented as an alleged victim by a botched New York Times report actually says she has no memory of the incident. So, seeing as Shapiro’s stance was pretty mainstream, the “watchdog” or, better, smear agent known as Media Matters had to get creative and invent a controversy where there was none. After all, they’ve got to bring in the clicks somehow!
Here’s how Media Matters hack Jason Campbell represented the totality of Shapiro’s comments: Tweet
That’s right: He seized on one line, clipped it away from its context, and misrepresented Shapiro’s point to make it seem as if he’s “dismissing” any accuser who can’t describe their assailant's genitalia in detail. This is typical Media Matters stuff. The reason it matters, though, is that people spread it without realizing where it came from. Knowingly or unknowingly, left-wing feminists and journalists took Media Matters’ smear and ran with it.
TweetTweetTweet
Campbell’s dishonestly clipped video has almost 5 million views as of writing, and it prompted an entire Twitter moment: “Ben Shapiro dismisses allegations of sexual assault against Brett Kavanaugh.”
Too bad the entire thing is fake.
In the full clip, Shapiro specifically says that the inability to describe Kavanaugh’s genitalia is “not dispositive,” saying “maybe they were generic,” and simply offered the hypothetical as one example of the type of corroborating details the accusations against Kavanaugh lack. This wasn’t the core of his point, and he wasn’t using it to make a sweeping, broad dismissal as Campbell clearly, and falsely, implied.
Plus, the mention of genitalia description isn’t exactly wild in and of itself. As Shapiro notes, this was part of past accusations against political figures, and it is regularly used by law enforcement in the investigation of sexual crimes.
That’s not to say that women victimized by assault must or should remember the appearance of their attackers’ genitalia, which Shapiro never suggested, but rather that it is occasionally used as a corroborating detail.
Most of these five million viewers, though, will never see anything more than the Media Matters headline. They won’t watch the full clip or see anything more than Campbell’s one-line suggestion that Shapiro “dismissed” the allegations “with” an argument about genitalia. This is, of course, the fault of Media Matters, for their disingenuous, bad-faith approach to smear journalism.
But it’s also the fault of supposedly credible (at least, enough to be regularly published at the Bulwark) mainstream journalists such as Molly Jong-Fast and progressive activists such as Jessica Valenti. They, and liberal commentators more broadly, should know better than to mistake Media Matters for a credible source.
In reality, Media Matters workers are little more than salaried internet trolls. Their literal job is to sit in front of a screen all day watching conservative commentators, fast-forwarding through to find the one word in 1,000 that can possibly be twisted against them. They read thousands upon thousands of words a day, skimming through all context and valid arguments just looking for soundbites that can be distorted to discredit their political opponents.
Media Matters’ work is shameless hackery, plain and simple. Their “journalism” is a disgrace for sure, but the bigger disgrace is that anyone still takes them seriously.

Texto completo: Sen. Dick Durbin said there is no chance of impeaching Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh after a New York Times article came out over the weekend with a new allegation of sexual misconduct.
"Get real," the Illinois Democrat said Monday, according to Politico. "We’ve got to get beyond this 'impeachment is the answer to every problem.' It’s not realistic."
"If that’s how we are identified in Congress, as the impeachment Congress, we run the risk that people will feel we’re ignoring the issues that mean a lot to them as families," he added. Durbin, 74, is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which oversaw the confirmation of Kavanaugh.
In the aftermath of the New York Times piece, several Democratic presidential candidates came out in support of impeaching Kavanaugh.
South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said there was also no chance of impeaching the Supreme Court justice over "scurrilous accusations."
The New York Times published a piece this weekend which cited unnamed officials who claimed Max Stier witnessed Kavanaugh have pushing his penis into an unnamed woman's hand during a party. The woman said the event never happened, according to friends.
The New York Times was forced to issue a correction after the original piece did not include the woman's denial.

VOTE PUSHED BACK

Texto completo: The city's Public Design Commission has pushed back its vote on a women's suffrage monument proposed for Central Park, despite concerns that a delay could jeopardize plans to unveil it on a historic anniversary next August.
Monumental Women - the nonprofit working to bring the statue of Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Sojourner Truth to the park - hopes to unveil it during a ceremony on Aug. 26, 2020 - the centennial of the day the 19th Amendment went into effect.
The group has already secured the Parks Department's approval for the monument but still needs a majority vote from the design commission to move forward.
At a public hearing on Monday, however, the commission voted unanimously to table its vote, "with an intent to move forward as quickly as possible," its president Signe Nielsen said. She cited the need for input from historians as well as letters from local community boards in support of an updated rendering of the statue.  
The proposed monument, which originally included just Stanton and Anthony, was modified to include Truth last month after advocates criticized it for failing to recognize any suffragists of color.
"I do think we cannot have a statue of two white women representing the vote for all women," activist Gloria Steinem told the New York Times in January.
The current proposal for the statue features Truth sitting with Stanton at a table inside the latter's home, with Anthony standing behind them carrying "documentation of injustices" in her traveling bag, artist Meredith Bergmann said in a statement.
But the announcement about the updated monument, too, drew criticism. Nearly two dozen scholars, including Harlem Historical Society director Jacob Morris, signed a letter in August claiming a statue showing the three activists working together "could obscure the substantial differences between white and black suffrage activists, and would be misleading."
However, during testimony prior to the commission's vote, Washington Street Advocacy Group president Todd Fine read testimony on behalf of Morris, who criticized Monumental Women for keeping renderings of the new statue from the public until Monday's hearing but didn't criticize the statue itself. 
The Harlem Historical Society wrote that it had "no objection to the fundamental features of the design," Morris wrote.
"For the purposes of civic and societal unity and pride it is understandable that the statue fund would want to represent a 'kumbaya' moment of togetherness," he wrote, adding that Bergmann's design was "sensitive to the critiques" that had been expressed previously.
A plaque on the pedestal below the statue, Morris argued, should provide "sufficient historical context" regarding the "different objectives" of black and white suffrage activists.
In addition to asking Monumental Women to submit letters of support from the community boards as well as "independent opinions" from historians that speak to the accuracy of the monument, Nielsen also noted the commission had minor "aesthetic concerns" about the statue itself that still need to be addressed. If those issues are resolved within the next month, the commission will put the monument on its consent agenda for approval, she said.
"I am in complete support of the concept and initiative of a statue to monumental women," Nielsen explained.
"We do not want to delay this any further," she added. "[But] we do have to point out to members of the public that there have been several changes along the way here not requested specifically by our commission, that has been part of the reason for some of the delay."
Despite the controversy the proposed statue has stirred, nobody at the meeting raised concerns about the monument's design.
Approximately 15 other attendees - including Manhattan Borough President Gale Brewer, several members of Monumental Women and a representative for Rep. Carolyn Maloney - testified in support.
Monumental Women board member Brenda Berkman, a retired FDNY captain who was the sole named class plaintiff in a sex discrimination lawsuit that compelled the FDNY to start hiring female firefighters, said she'd seen how "images of strong historic women can inspire young women to be brave in their own lives."
"For me, history is both living and important," she said.
After the commission tabled its vote, Monumental Women board member Namita Luthra said she was confident the group would secure community board support, adding that members were "hoping for a very quick resolution."
Monumental Women's president Pam Elam, meanwhile, told amNewYork she wasn't surprised by the commission's decision.
"To be totally honest, we expected them to do this. It's just another delay," she said.
"[But] we persist," she added. "And we will not stop until that beautiful statue stands on the mall in Central Park, and all of the millions of people who see it will just honor those women, and hopefully feel energized to complete the journey that they started for full equality for women."

'Destroying any institution they can't control': Josh Hawley condemns Democrats for demanding Kavanaugh impeachment

Texto completo: Republican Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley condemned Democrats for their chorus of calls to impeach Justice Brett Kavanaugh amid a new sexual misconduct allegation, and accused the party of seeking to destroy any institution over which they do not wield power.
"You know, they want to impeach Justice Kavanaugh, they want to pack the Supreme Court. I mean, talk about destroying any institution they can’t control," the member of the Senate Judiciary Committee said in an exclusive interview with Hill.TV. "It's really unbelievable. This is a Democrat Party that increasingly is at war with the American Constitution."
After the New York Times published a since-corrected report alleging that Kavanaugh pressed his genitalia against a woman at a drunken Yale party in the 1980s, several 2020 Democratic candidates have demanded an impeachment inquiry against him. The same liberal activist groups that were caught slipping cash to disruptive protesters during his confirmation hearings last fall have also demanded his removal from the high court.
"I mean, they’re willing to destroy an entire branch of government, the independent judiciary, they now want to destroy it. Why? Because it won’t rule the way they want it to," Hawley continued. "I mean, is there anything more dangerous to constitutional government than that way of thinking?"
"My message to my Democrat colleagues would be: 'Look, it's an independent judiciary. Sooner or later, you’ll have your chance to appoint judges to the bench, and you should appoint qualified judges to do so, but don’t destroy people and institutions in order to try to get your way. I mean that’s just not who we are as Americans.'"
President Trump defended Kavanaugh against the new accusations, tweeting Sunday that the "Radical Left Democrats" are colluding with the "LameStream media" to destroy his Supreme Court nominee.

New Kavanaugh book says seven people back up Deborah Ramirez allegation. Who are they?

Texto completo: A much-discussed article by New York Times reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, authors of the new book The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation, revives the story of Deborah Ramirez, the woman who, during last year's Supreme Court nomination fight, said that a drunken Kavanaugh thrust his penis at her (she was also drunk) at a party at Yale during the 1983-1984 school year.
Pogrebin and Kelly claim that extensive evidence supports the Ramirez allegation. "At least seven people, including Ms. Ramirez's mother, heard about the Yale incident long before Mr. Kavanaugh was a federal judge," they write in the article. "Two of those people were classmates who learned of it just days after the party occurred, suggesting that it was discussed among students at the time."
The article did not, however, discuss what any of those seven people actually said about the alleged incident. Nevertheless, partisans quickly seized on it to support their position on Kavanaugh. There was "substantial corroboration" for Ramirez's story, tweeted Susan Hennessey, editor of the influential blog Lawfare. For their part, some Democratic presidential candidates — Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Beto O'Rourke, and Pete Buttigieg — cited the story as (additional) cause for Kavanaugh to be impeached.
Still, what did those seven people say? Pogrebin and Kelly had the opportunity to describe that at length in their new book. But a look at the book, which will be officially released tomorrow, shows the authors do not offer much there either. The role the seven people played in the Ramirez matter is discussed mostly in two places, pages 64-67 and pages 262-263. Here is a look at who they are and what they said, as described by Pogrebin and Kelly:
1.) Ramirez's mother. Pogrebin and Kelly report that Ramirez "does not remember telling anyone about [the alleged incident] at the time." Later, though, while Ramirez was still in college — meaning in the following two or three years — Ramirez had a talk with her mother, Mary Ann LeBlanc. According to the book, they were in a restaurant, and Ramirez began crying. "[She] confessed through tears, 'Something happened at Yale,'" the book reports.
Something happened at Yale. According to Pogrebin and Kelly, that was all Ramirez told her mother at the time, and it was all Ramirez told her mother about the alleged incident for the next 35 years, until Kavanaugh was nominated to the Supreme Court.
The reason, the authors explain, was that the subject was just too emotionally wrenching for Ramirez to recount, even to her mother. "It was extremely painful," LeBlanc told the authors. "I thought she was raped; that's how hysterical she was. She did not want to talk about that. It was like a dead subject — don't go there, because it hurt so much." Nevertheless, the entirety of Ramirez's semi-contemporaneous revelation to her mother was: Something happened at Yale.
2.) Kenneth Appold. A suitemate of Kavanaugh's at Yale who is now the James Hastings Nichols Professor of Reformation History at Princeton Theological Seminary, Appold was an original source for the New Yorker story that first reported the Ramirez allegation. Appold spoke anonymously for that piece, but later, in October 2018, allowed his name to be used in a New Yorker update because he hoped to force an FBI investigation of Kavanaugh. The New Yorker said Appold "first heard about the alleged incident ... either the night it occurred or a day or two later." Appold said an eyewitness told him the story and that he believes it is true because what he heard matches Ramirez's account even though Appold has never spoken to her.
Appold told Pogrebin and Kelly a bit more. "Within a couple of days of the party, Ken Appold stood in a Lawrence Hall entryway and was told by two Stiles freshmen (whose identity he can't recall) what Kavanaugh had done to Ramirez," the authors write. (Stiles is a Yale living area.) "'It was fresh in their recollections,' Appold said. 'One person saw it; the second person was hearing the story from him for the second time.'"
Appold told the New Yorker that when Kavanaugh was nominated, he, Appold, tried to get in touch with the person who actually witnessed the alleged event but got no response. The magazine reported that it was able to reach the classmate, "but he said that he had no memory of the incident."
Still, Appold said the Ramirez matter was "not the kind of thing you forget." And, for Pogrebin and Kelly, he added a damning new twist: "Appold said he was told an additional detail, however, that Ramirez does not remember," the authors write, "that after she pushed the penis away, Kavanaugh went with Genda into the bathroom, became erect, came back out, and tried it again." (Kevin Genda was a classmate of both Kavanaugh and Ramirez.)
"That was the story as I heard it," Appold told Pogrebin and Kelly. Whether Appold told that to the New Yorker is not clear, but in any event, the New Yorker did not publish it, although it certainly would have been big news in the context of the nomination battle.
3.) Michael Wetstone. A Kavanaugh classmate, the authors note that Wetstone "confirmed to the New Yorker that he remembered Appold telling him about the same incident in graduate school." It is not clear whether Pogrebin and Kelly spoke to Wetstone or just used the New Yorker's work. But the New Yorker's description of Wetstone's story was not particularly strong; Wetstone learned about the alleged incident from Appold, who was his graduate school roommate and who told the New Yorker he informed Wetstone about it in 1989 or 1990.
4.) Richard Oh. Another Kavanaugh classmate, the authors say Oh "overheard a female student emotionally describing making contact with a fake penis, saying 'It's not real,' and then realizing it was real." The book contains no word on who that student might have been. (It also says Ramirez "does not remember telling anyone about [the alleged incident] at the time.") Oh, who gave an affidavit to Ramirez's legal team, told the authors that, whoever the emotional female student was, his memory matches that of Ramirez, even though he does not know her.
5.) Anonymous. Pogrebin and Kelly report that "an unidentified friend of Ramirez's ... said in a recent affidavit that she heard about the incident in the 1990s." The book offers no other information about the unidentified friend or her recollection.
6. & 7.) Chad Ludington and James Roche. Pogrebin and Kelly write that "two other people from Kavanaugh and Ramirez's Yale class, Chad Ludington and James Roche, vaguely remember hearing about something happening to Ramirez during freshman year."
That is the seven. Number 1, Ramirez's mother, based her account on four very unspecific words from her daughter 35 years ago. Number 2, Appold, based his account on a memory of being told something by a "witness" who could not recall the incident at all. Number 3, Wetstone, heard it from Appold. Number 4, Oh, overheard something from someone he doesn't remember that did not connect the incident to Kavanaugh. Number 5, Anonymous, is totally unclear. And Number 6 and Number 7, Ludington and Roche, had "vague" memories that also did not connect an unspecified incident to Kavanaugh.
That is enough for Pogrebin and Kelly, who conclude, "The claims of Deborah Ramirez, while not proven by witnesses, also ring true." Perhaps that will convince some readers. For others: When anti-Kavanaugh partisans cite "substantial corroboration" for Ramirez's allegation, it's good to keep in mind who really said what.

Texto completo: Morning Joe host Joe Scarborough questioned why the New York Times originally left out certain facts about a new sexual misconduct allegation in a piece about Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
“Everybody makes mistakes,” Scarborough said Monday. “We were on the phone yesterday asking each other, wait a second, there’s a woman who [Max] Stier claims was abused by Kavanaugh. Has she denied this? Has she claimed this happened? Why is there this glaring omission in the New York Times story?”
“I could not believe the New York Times would write this piece without that information contained in it,” he continued.
The New York Times piece was adapted from an upcoming book by reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, titled The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation.
The adaption said Max Stier, one of Kavanaugh’s male classmates at Yale University, had witnessed Kavanaugh make inappropriate sexual contact with a female student in the mid-1980s.
An updated version of the piece included an editor’s note that said the female student “declined to be interviewed and friends say she does not recall the episode.”
The piece also did not include that Stier was one of the attorney’s representing former President Bill Clinton during Ken Starr's investigation into the president in the 1990s. Kavanaugh was part of Starr’s team.
“Was it not relevant to note that he was opposing counsel on the other side of Brett Kavanaugh in the Monica Lewinsky legal proceedings? I just don’t understand why they didn’t put this information in the article,” Scarborough said. iFrame Object

Texto completo: A newly revealed allegation about Brett Kavanaugh comes from Clinton impeachment defense lawyer Max Stier.
The alleged victim told friends she doesn't remember the incident.
Judge Brett Kavanaugh faced two main allegations during his Supreme Court confirmation process. California professor Christine Blasey Ford claimed Kavanaugh and a classmate of his attempted to sexually assault her in a Maryland suburb home in high school. Kavanaugh denies the incident occurred, and the other alleged attendees of the the party named by Ford all deny any recollection of the event, including Ford’s friend Leland Keyser, who now says she doubts the incident ever happened.
Deborah Martinez, who alleged that Kavanaugh put his penis in her face at a freshman year party at Yale, causing her to inadvertently touch it when she swatted it away. Kavanaugh denies that incident as well, and none of the three alleged witnesses to the event named by Ramirez have supported her claim.
The new allegation by Stier was revealed in a Sunday essay by New York Times reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly previewing their forthcoming book, The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation. The Washington Examiner obtained a copy of the book, published by Portfolio, before its wider release Tuesday.
“We also uncovered a previously unreported story about Mr. Kavanaugh in his freshman year that echoes Ms. Ramirez’s allegation,” Pogrebin and Kelly wrote on Sunday. “A classmate, Max Stier, saw Mr. Kavanaugh with his pants down at a different drunken dorm party, where friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student.”
The article led to almost immediate calls for impeachment from leading Democratic presidential candidates and others. The New York Times, under pressure online from conservatives, added an editor's note Sunday evening that stated “the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident.”

The article described Stier as someone who “runs a nonprofit organization in Washington,” and the book by Pogrebin and Kelly described him as “a respected thought leader on federal government management issues in Washington as the founding president and chief executive of the Partnership for Public Service.”
But it wasn't in that capacity that Stier first found himself at odds with Kavanaugh.
While Kavanaugh worked on independent counsel Ken Starr’s lengthy and contentious investigation into President Bill Clinton, ultimately helping author the Starr Report and its impeachment referral, Stier worked on Clinton’s impeachment defense team and helped the embattled president fight charges of perjury flowing from his false denials about an affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.

"The Framers, in their wisdom, left this Body the solemn obligation of determining not what is sinful, but rather what is impeachable," Stier and the rest of Clinton's legal team told the House Judiciary Committee in 1998. "The President has not sugar-coated the reality of his wrongdoing. Neither should the Committee ignore the high standards of the Constitution to overturn a national election and to impeach a President."

Pogrebin and Kelly also claimed in their essay that Stier “notified senators and the F.B.I. about this account, but the F.B.I. did not investigate.” Staffers for Sen. Chuck Grassley, then-chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee directly overseeing the Kavanaugh confirmation, told the Washington Examiner that Stier never informed them about this allegation. The Washington Post reported Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware, sent the allegation to FBI Director Christopher Wray. But Grassley’s office said it had not been made aware of the specifics of the claim.
Pogrebin and Kelly also noted that “Mr. Stier has declined to discuss it publicly” and claimed that they had “corroborated the story with two officials who have communicated with Mr. Stier.” But that appears to be a corroboration that Stier had made this claim, not corroboration from any other witnesses to the incident or from the alleged victim herself.

If the allegation is true, it would mean Stier knew for decades but didn't speak up.

Pogrebin and Kelly didn’t weigh in on the veracity of Stier’s claim in their book, but they did assert that the allegations from both Ford and Ramirez “ring true.” Ford’s friend Keyser told the authors, “I don’t have any confidence in the story.”
And although Pogrebin and Kelly asserted that they found five people with a “strong recollection of hearing about the incident” with Ramirez and Kavanaugh before Kavanaugh became a judge, none of those people were eyewitnesses, one only heard vague details of “something [that] happened at Yale” in which Kavanaugh wasn’t named, and another was told within a decade of it allegedly happening. Two other people mentioned by Pogrebin and Kelly “vaguely remember hearing about something happening to Ramirez during freshman year.”
“The people who allegedly witnessed the event — Kavanaugh’s friends Kevin Genda, David Todd, and David White — have kept mum about it,” Pogrebin and Kelly wrote in their book. “Kavanaugh has denied it.”

Texto completo: El Fiscal de Distrito de Manhattan se niega a dejar de ver las declaraciones de impuestos del presidente Donald Trump.
De acuerdo con el New York Times, la oficina que dirige Cyrus R. Vance Jr . ha solicitado ver ocho años de impuestos de Trump, tanto los personales como los corporativos. El pedido es parte de la investigación sobre supuestos pagos secretos a la actriz porno Stormy Daniels , quien habría tenido relaciones sexuales con el presidente.
El pago lo habría hecho Michael Cohen, exabogado de Trump, para comprar el silencio de Daniels. El magnate o su organización habrían reembolsado el dinero a Cohen. El mandatario ha desmentido las acusaciones pero tampoco ha revelados sus impuestos tal y como prometio en 2016.
Donald Trump está celoso del negocio millonario de Barack Obama con Netflix
Cohen se declaró culpable de violar la ley de financiación de campañas políticas y fue sentenciado a tres años de prisión. La investigación del fiscal de Manhattan se concentra en el pago de $130,000 dólares de Cohen a Daniels, cuyo nombre verdadero es Stephanie Clifford . Este se habría hecho antes de la elección.
Trump por ahora ha evitado revelar sus impuestos en investigaciones del Congreso. El Times aclaró que las declaraciones no se harían públicas en caso que el fiscal de Manhattan logre obtenerlas.

38 patients now reported to have mysterious vaping-related lung illness in Mass.

Texto completo: The number of patients believed to have a mysterious lung illness related to vaping has increased to 38 in Massachusetts, officials said Monday.
At least seven were teenagers who were treated at Boston Children's Hospital, officials said.
The statewide count rose from 10 after the state Department of Public Health last week issued an order requiring clinicians to report any possible cases of severe lung disease caused by vaping or use of electronic cigarettes.
The updated numbers came as the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention revised its nationwide tally, from 450 possible cases of illness to 380 probable cases, in 36 states. Six people have died.
Massachusetts officials said they are working with health providers to confirm how many of the 38 possible cases fit the CDC's criteria for the illness. On Monday, the agency activated its 24-hour emergency operations center to “protect our nation from this serious health threat."
The CDC said all patients with the disease reported vaping in previous weeks, days, or hours; most said they vaped cannabis, many reported vaping both cannabis and nicotine, and some said they vaped only nicotine. Patients have experienced symptoms such as cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, chest tightness, nausea, and vomiting.
Federal health officials have urged people to stop vaping all substances — especially ones bought on the black market — while they investigate what is causing the problem.
Vaporizers typically use metal coils to heat oils or liquids into vapor to be inhaled. Doctors say the lungs are not meant to handle liquid, and the vaporized oils may cause problems by cooling in the lungs to a liquid state. They also are concerned that the various ingredients in vape “pens" may transform into toxic chemicals when heated.
“The oil and the additives, when they're burned, turn into nasty chemicals," said Dr. Jordan Tishler, who specializes in cannabis medicine at his private practice, InhaleMD, in Cambridge and Brookline. “I very strongly discourage my patients from using oil pens. ... They're unsafe."
Tishler said he recommends his patients use edibles or vaporizers meant for raw marijuana buds, or flower, to avoid the carcinogens and toxins present in burnt smoke and in vaped oils.
While officials say they haven't found one culprit that seems to be responsible for all the reported illnesses, tests of sick patients' cannabis-vaping cartridges in New York revealed that many included a chemical known as vitamin E acetate.
That finding prompted New York officials to investigate suppliers of cannabis vaping additives and thickeners that included the oily vitamin E substance, including an Amherst-based company, Mass Terpenes. Mass Terpenes has stopped selling the products and a lawyer for the company said the owner is “devastated" about the ongoing illnesses.
In Massachusetts, the Cannabis Control Commission endorsed a measure last week to require all vaping products to list ingredients, including specific terpenes, a broad class of chemicals that are often used in the cartridges. Industry leaders and experts say that transparency is a good step, but they fear the many ingredients and the hardware used in legal pot cartridges have not been adequately tested for safety.
The ongoing scare has changed consumer behavior.
In the weeks since the first death was reported, in Illinois, vapes' share of recreational cannabis sales fell from 33 percent to 29 percent in California; 22.4 percent to 19 percent in Nevada; 19 percent to 14.5 percent in Colorado; and 17 percent to 14.6 percent in Washington, according to the Marijuana Business Daily. Data for Massachusetts is not available.
If you or a family member has suffered from a suspected vaping-related illness, we'd like to hear from you. Contact Naomi Martin at naomi.martin@globe.com..

Texto completo: Writer and former Major League Baseball player Doug Glanville has joined UConn's School of Education, where he will teach a course centered on the intersection of sports and society, Glanville told The Courant.
Glanville, who lives with his family in Bloomfield, has taught similar courses at Yale University and the University of Pennsylvania but said UConn offered him the chance to lead a broader program, featuring campus events, town halls and guest speakers accessible to all students.
"The spirit of what I've always wanted to do with this course is have it live beyond the classroom," he said. "It's one thing to have a classroom of a finite group of students. It's another thing when you're able to bring it to the student body and to the community."
Glanville said he will spend the fall advising students, learning the campus and developing ideas, then launch his course during the spring semester.
While teaching at UConn, Glanville will continue to contribute to ESPN's baseball coverage, as well as NBC Sports Chicago's broadcasts of Chicago Cubs games, while writing and podcasting for publications including The Athletic and The New York Times.
Glanville said he hopes to engage as many UConn students as possible, using sports to discuss the broader world. Instead of a traditional Super Bowl party, he said, he might host football watchers for a discussion about social and political issues surrounding the game. When a story breaks that has resonance both inside the sports world and beyond it, such as the NFL's controversial "social-justice" partnership with Jay Z, he might convene experts for a panel or public forum.
Glanville said sports offer a useful entry point for conversations about difficult subjects.
"Most sports, especially professionally, have a minor obsession with a level playing field. We want rules to be fair, equal for both teams," he said. "There's constant work behind the scenes, and sometimes even on the front-lines, to make the game fair. And that to me is a really good way in to discuss how we can elevate humanity and see ourselves in one space, with one goal."
In recent years, Glanville noted, athletes have grown increasingly vocal about political and social issues, including criminal justice, police misconduct, LGBTQ rights, gender pay equity and more. As sports media outlets have weighed how to cover sports' intersection with those and other subjects, athletes including Colin Kaepernick, LeBron James and Maya Moore, as well as activists such as longtime California-Berkeley sociologist Harry Edwards have continued to bring attention to them.
Glanville played Major League Baseball from 1996-2004, collecting 1,100 hits and 168 stolen bases. He has since written about subjects ranging from racism in baseball to the value of the sport's warning track, while also appearing on television as a studio and game analyst. In 2010, he published a book, "The Game From Where I Stand," and in 2014, he made national news after an essay for The Atlantic that detailed a run-in with a West Hartford police officer in the driveway of his home.
"I've always been comfortable being able to talk on and address a lot of these topics," Glanville said. "It hasn't been easy, but the long game has worked out fairly well. It's created a lot of good conversations."
At UConn's Neag School of Education, Glanville will work alongside new hires Danielle DeRosa, Jesse Mala and Eli Wolff, plus Jennifer McGarry, Laura Burton, and Justin Evanovich.

Texto completo: Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh "should start suing people for libel" or the U.S. Justice Department "should come to his rescue," President Donald Trump tweeted Sunday, following a New York Times report detailing sexual misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh.
Kavanaugh was sworn in to the Supreme Court last year following a tumultuous Senate confirmation process in which women accused the judge of sexual misconduct during his time in high school and college.
"Brett Kavanaugh should start suing people for libel, or the Justice Department should come to his rescue," Trump tweeted Sunday morning. "The lies being told about him are unbelievable. False Accusations without recrimination. When does it stop? They are trying to influence his opinions. Can't let that happen!"
Trump also tweeted, "Now the Radical Left Democrats and their Partner, the LameStream Media, are after Brett Kavanaugh again, talking loudly of their favorite word, impeachment. He is an innocent man who has been treated HORRIBLY. Such lies about him. They want to scare him into turning Liberal!"
The Times article, published Saturday, centered on Deborah Ramirez, a Kavanaugh accuser who said the judge had exposed himself to her during a drinking game while they were freshmen at Yale University. The Times story detailed further corroboration of the account, included another sexual misconduct claim and noted that the FBI did not interview witnesses who said they could back up the claims.
Former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julián Castro, a Democratic candidate for president, tweeted Sunday that Kavanaugh should be impeached. "It's more clear than ever that Brett Kavanaugh lied under oath," Castro wrote, referencing the article. "He should be impeached. And Congress should review the failure of the Department of Justice to properly investigate the matter."
On Sunday, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), another presidential candidate, said on ABC's "This Week" that she would need to review documents related to the government's investigations of Kavanaugh. "My concern here is that the process was a sham. I don't think you can look at impeachment hearings without getting the documents ... and the Attorney General is shielding documents."
But Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said on "This Week" that last year, the Senate Judiciary Committee "did what we should have done. We held a hearing, we - we invited the principal witness to testify, we heard it, the American people heard it and at the end of the day, the American people made a judgment that - that the evidence wasn't there, the corroboration wasn't there, and - and I think this article just shows the obsession with the far left."
Cruz said, "I bet you the next Democratic debate, they'll all be saying impeach Kavanaugh, impeach Trump. There's nobody they don't want to impeach. And at some point, they just have to let the anger go and recognize that the democratic process actually moves on. And I think it's time for them to do that."

Loud music not for everyone

Texto completo: Outdoor, amplified music in rural Northern New Mexico is becoming a bigger issue these days, whether it be in towns such as Taos or smaller communities like Pojoaque. Corporate entities are looking for places that are rural, quiet and have charm to put on their money-making events, parties or weddings that disrupt the very qualities of these communities that make them special.
Neighbors of venues such as Kit Carson Park and La Mesita Ranch, which now hosts outdoor wedding parties that involve the same kind of window-rattling late-night bass and loud crowd noise, need to speak up and demand that noise ordinances and land-use rules are enforced or strengthened whether they be established by state, county or tribal government.
People are looking to party outdoors, but they need to be aware that they are not the only ones out there and must be given boundaries that are enforced. Maintaining peace and quiet among our communities in the long run is priceless and should be everyone's concern.

A Santa Fe welcome
I am very proud as a Santa Fean and a New Mexican to say that Santa Fe, in partnership with Somos un Pueblo Unido, is leading the way in implementing real, practical policy to welcome immigrants and to build a community of inclusion and equal rights here. Tuesday, Sept. 17, is Citizenship Day, and we will celebrate one year since Santa Fe and Somos started Citizenship Now! to help eligible individuals navigate the process of becoming citizens. Now, 105 Santa Feans are on a path to obtaining their United States citizenship and to fuller participation in our town, state and country.
The partnership between our city and Somos began under the Delgado administration and continues now with Mayor Alan Webber's administration. The work -- starting in Santa Fe more than 20 years ago -- has led to advances in access to higher education, driver's licenses, better police/community relations, controls on racial profiling, our living wage and now, a program to help immigrants become citizens.

Defies logic
Regarding the opinion ("O'Rourke's right on gun control," Sept. 6) by New York Times columnist Charles M. Blow, he fails to understand or ignore the U.S. Constitution; there is a difference between a right and a privilege. Driving a car is a privilege and licensing can be required. The Bill of Rights guarantees the right to keep and bear arms -- "a national gun licensing system and registry" violates this principle. As per the First Amendment, one does not need to be licensed or registered for free speech -- yet, "The pen is mightier than the sword."
"Implementing red flag laws" violates an individual's due process in a court of law. The author states, "As O'Rourke points out ... anything we can do to prevent guns from being used in a crime ... must be a consuming priority for all of us." Really? Even if our constitutional rights are trampled upon? Such logic could be used with great detriment to many of us for many different reasons. Gun violence is a problem. However, the author's opinions defy logic and threaten our democracy.

Great laugh, stories
I was saddened by the news of Rhea Goodman's passing ("S.F. radio host remembered for living juicy," Sept. 7). I was briefly one of Rhea's roommates in a beautiful house off of East Alameda Street in the early '90s. She had the richest laugh I've ever heard. She had great stories. I loved that she went on a date with Steve McQueen. I'm sure she's juicing her afterlife right now.

Worthless taxes
It goes against a politician's worst instincts -- with nearly $1 billion in budget extra surplus projected for next year, above and beyond the extra $1 billion surplus level this year. Hey, Senate Majority Leader Peter Wirth, D-Santa Fe, how about rescinding all the new taxes and increases that were pushed through this year despite the first massive surplus? Beyond that, the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association predicts our crude oil production will increase 358 percent by 2030, and natural gas production expanding by 106 percent ("Powered by oil and gas," Sept. 10).

In great need, but warmed with hope

Texto completo: When you're up against it, you realize that almost anything is worth a try, even if its a bit offbeat and out of the norm.
Taj Mohammed is up against.
His family has placed ads, says Taj's wife, Nissha. They've talked about their situation among worship friends. They've asked others to tell others to tell others.
Their need? A kidney.
"With an O-type blood, we've been told the wait could be four to six years," says Nissha.
Four to six years? For a 71-year-old man already on dialysis?
Enter the offbeat and out of the norm
A few weeks ago, the Mohammeds began planting signs in yards at all points of Bloomington-Normal, announcing their need along with a phone number.
A not-good story can occasionally gain a feel-good sidebar, and this is another.
"The first day," says Nissha, "we had four people call! We've had a couple more! It's all pretty amazing! We are so happy!"
Those who call the sign's number are asked to pass on necessary information and qualifications to a transplant center in Peoria.
All that is confidential, even to the Mohammeds.
"I'm dying to know how all that is going," says Nissha, "But I don't ask because I don't want to hurt any of his (Taj's) chances."
Taj Mohammed? Still fully up against it. But in these times of nasty headlines and horrific events, what Taj and Nissha also are learning is that there still are many who care, that out of the glare there remains kindness and the ultimate of generosity and giving.
Thats a strong message, a feel-good inside a not-so-good indeed.
Those pants of Maggie's!
As a kid in Chillicothe, Maggie Vespa made a name for herself thanks to a well-known set of parents  her mom, Kay, was a news anchor on the Peoria-Bloomington ABC affiliate (todays WHOI) and her dad was Joe Vespa, a longtime Peoria County circuit court judge.
At the U of I, Maggie Vespa continued to make a name, this time on her own, as a star reporter at the Daily Illini newspaper.
After that, she made a bigger name as a reporter and weekend news anchor at WEEK and WHOI.
Now 31 and in Portland, Ore., an anchor and reporter there, too, she is this week world-famous for entirely another reason.
She wore high-waisted pants to work.
Everyone, as Andy Warhol said, has their 15 minutes and Maggie Vespa is developing an entire set of 15-minute chunks, her most recent developing last weekend when a male viewer commented on a Facebook page at KGW-TV that hed like to see her dress like a normal woman, in something other than "those ridiculous high-waisted pants.
TV folk will tell you that viewers often comment about on-air clothing, and its almost always of womens. A male anchor can wear the same suit for weeks and no one notices. A female anchor can wear one outfit that might be different and the phone lines and online posts light up.
Usually thats the end of it.
But Maggie last week took a public stand, on-air, offering some empowering words for women (Dress how you want, look how you want, and if anyone tries to make you feel less comfortable because of that, thats their problem, not yours) and to send home the point, then wore high-waisted pants ... for her next five TV appearances.
The Associated Press heard about it and did a story. USA Today picked it up. The Washington Post then did a feature as did The New York Times. One night last week on WEEK  coincidentally right after the 25 News on which just a few years before she was a regular  Inside Edition with Deborah Norville did a full segment.
Maggie? "Amazed, flattered, dumbfounded," she says, by the enormous publicity that her simple wardrobe and response has generated.
And her mom, Kay, still living in Chillicothe?
Throughout her life, Maggie has had a strong backbone and the uncanny ability to speak her mind. Its a quality Ive always admired. So it was no surprise to see her take to the airwaves and make a bold statement on the behalf of those in the public eye who silently endure critiques about their appearances, thinking it comes with the territory. Having been an anchor before, viewers had no qualms about critiquing my appearance, as if my only job was to be pleasing to the eye. I never talked back. To see my daughter do so with more bravery than I could ever muster has left me nearly breathless.
Then she adds, Im simply one proud mama.
Yup, Maggie Vespa is even more making a name for herself.
Were now waiting for the "Maggie Vespa High-Waisted Pants Collection."

Reagan didn’t meet with Taliban, and Disney didn’t dismantle

Resumen: Harris didn’t sue Exxon as California AG Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris, during a recent climate town hall broadcast on CNN, told viewers she would fight big oil companies that "profit off of harmful behaviors." [...]checks other media did on the subject, The New York Times said, "An investigation, yes. According to PolitiFact, Snopes.com debunked this story in October 2017, but it can be traced back as far as 1997 to a Chicago Tribune story headlined "25 secrets of the Magic Kingdom," which aimed to dispel a rumor that the castle could be taken apart and said the castle is built to withstand hurricane winds. * Bob Oswald is a veteran Chicago-area journalist and former news editor of the Elgin Courier-News.

Texto completo: A photo circulating on social media shows former President Ronald Reagan in the Oval Office meeting with a group of men in turbans and, in a Twitter post that includes the photo, the caption reads: "NeverTrumpers, a president meeting with the Taliban, this is horrific!" A Facebook post of the photo falsely claims, "Ronald Reagan meets with the Taliban. ‘These gentlemen are the moral equivalents of America’s Founding Fathers’ — Ronald Reagan, 1985."
The item is untrue on many levels, said PolitiFact.com.
The Taliban didn’t form until the mid 1990s, years after Reagan was out of office. The photo wasn’t taken in 1985, and Reagan never compared the group to the Founding Fathers. The photo is from a Feb. 2, 1983, meeting between the president and Afghan freedom fighters to discuss Soviet atrocities in Afghanistan, PolitiFact said. The quote was likely taken from a Reagan speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference in 1985, PolitiFact said. Reagan was talking about Nicaraguan rebels when he said, "I’ve spoken recently of the freedom fighters of Nicaragua. You know the truth about them. You know who they’re fighting and why. They are the moral equal of our Founding Fathers and the brave men and women of the French Resistance."
The Twitter post, which showed up after President Donald Trump recently announced he had called off a meeting with the Taliban, has been shared more than 1,700 times, PolitiFact said.
Harris didn’t sue Exxon as California AG Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris, during a recent climate town hall broadcast on CNN, told viewers she would fight big oil companies that "profit off of harmful behaviors."
Moderator Erin Burnett asked the California senator how she would fight.
"Would you sue them? Sue Exxon Mobil?" Burnett said.
Harris claimed, "I have sued Exxon Mobil."
That statement falls short of the truth, according to PolitiFact.com.
In 2016, when Harris was California’s attorney general, her office investigated Exxon over allegations the organization lied about the risk to its business from climate change, PolitiFact said. But there is no public record and nothing her campaign could provide to show she filed a lawsuit.
"(Harris) launched an investigation into Exxon," campaign spokesman Ian Sams told PolitiFact.
In fact checks other media did on the subject, The New York Times said, "An investigation, yes. A lawsuit, no." CNN said, "Though Harris has sued other big oil companies, she has not sued ExxonMobil."
Cinderella’s Castle not dismantled for hurricane A photo showing the spires being removed from the Cinderella Castle at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida, in preparation for Hurricane Dorian, has been shared hundreds of times on social media.
A caption with the photo reads, "BREAKING: Workers have begun removing spires of Cinderella Castle at Magic Kingdom ahead of Hurricane Dorian."
The image has been flagged by Facebook as part of its effort to combat false news and misinformation, according to PolitiFact.com.
"It’s just another iteration of a long-running hoax about Florida hurricanes," PolitiFact said.
In the false photo, a crane appears to be lifting a spire off its base and another spire is completely gone. However, in the original photo, the crane is in the same position while it was reportedly being used to remove holiday lights, PolitiFact said. Both spires are intact. In the altered photo, it appears someone cloned the blue sky and placed it over part of one spire and completely removed the other spire from the picture.
Disney World told PolitiFact on Sept. 4 that the theme park would not dismantle the castle in preparation of Hurricane Dorian.
According to PolitiFact, Snopes.com debunked this story in October 2017, but it can be traced back as far as 1997 to a Chicago Tribune story headlined "25 secrets of the Magic Kingdom," which aimed to dispel a rumor that the castle could be taken apart and said the castle is built to withstand hurricane winds.

Texto completo: California Sen. Kamala Harris joined other 2020 Democratic candidates in saying Justice Brett Kavanaugh must be impeached after a new sexual misconduct allegation was leveled against him on Saturday.
"Brett Kavanaugh lied to the U.S. Senate and most importantly to the American people. He was put on the Court through a sham process and his place on the Court is an insult to the pursuit of truth and justice," the Democratic presidential candidate tweeted Sunday.
Tweet
Other Democratic presidential candidates have either expressed concern about the allegation or have outright called for Kavanaugh's impeachment because of it.
TweetTweetTweetTweetTweet

One of Kavanaugh's male classmates at Yale University, Max Stier, witnessed him make inappropriate sexual contact with a female student, according to the New York Times. Stier informed the FBI during his confirmation process last year, but the FBI did not investigate it.
President Trump defended Kavanaugh on Sunday, tweeting, "Radical Left Democrats" and the 'LameStream Media' are trying to slander Justice Brett Kavanaugh into 'turning Liberal.' He also encouraged Kavanaugh to 'start suing people for libel' or 'the Justice Department should come to his rescue.'"

Texto completo: SANTA FE, N.M. — Glen Hansard, the Irishman who shot to fame for his role as a struggling musician in the 2007 movie “Once,” which included a song that won him an Academy Award, comes to Santa Fe for a show at the Lensic on Tuesday, Sept. 17.
Hansard’s varied career has also including working as lead singer for The Frames and one half of folk-rock duo The Swell Season. His new album, “This Wild Willing,” which came out in the spring, has received good notices and finds him moving into new sonic territory, with studio improvisations that often seem “tailored to rawer spaces, from intimate bars to the open air of a packed amphitheater,” says NPR. He told Rolling Stone he was tired of being an earnest balladeer.
You can check the results at the Lensic, 211 W. San Francisco St. The show starts at 7:30 p.m., with singer-songwriter Diana DeMuth – who’s from Massachusetts, but called her 2014 debut album “Albuquerque” – as the opener. Go to lensic.org/events for tickets priced at $46-$66.
Hansard partners with the PLUS1 organization “so that $1 from every ticket sold will go toward safeguarding people experiencing homelessness, and ending the cycle of homelessness and poverty.”
THE BLACK MADONNA: On Friday, Sept. 20, Mixmag’s 2016 DJ of the year, The Black Madonna – born Marea Stamper – comes to Meow Wolf.
A glowing 2017 profile in the New York Times referred to her closing the 2017 Spanish music festival Sónar “with a driving, euphoric set” and continued, “Ms. Stamper is known for an eclectic, organic sound that is not afraid to juxtapose mainstream pop tunes and obscure remixes, soulful disco and hard-edge bangers – her Sonar set somehow brought together Eddie Amador’s anthem ‘House Music,’ the Doobie Brothers’ ‘Long Train Running’ and Purple Disco Machine’s Sylvester-sampling ‘Body Funk.’ The Black Madonna is also known as an advocate for women and LGBT people in the club world.
Her 21-and-over Meow Wolf show at 1352 Rufina Circle with guest acts Commodore 256 and RiFF is from 9 p.m.-2 a.m. Advance tickets are $24.50 at santafe.meowwolf.com.
SEASON OPENER: Santa Fe Pro Musica’s season opens next weekend with some heroics at the Lensic.
The program that will be performed both Saturday, Sept. 21, and Sunday, Sept. 22, is called “Heroic Beethoven,” although not all the music is by Ludwig Van.
His monumental Symphony No. 3 “Eroica” is the featured piece. Rounding out the program is Julia Adolphe’s “Shiver and Bloom” and Erich Korngold’s film-inspired “Violin Concerto in D Major, Op. 35.” Thomas O’Connor, Pro Musica’s music director, is the conductor and violinist Colin Jacobsen, renowned in his own right and as a touring member of Yo-Yo Ma’s Silk Road Ensemble, is the featured soloist.
Tickets start at $12 for students and range up to $85. The Saturday show is at 4 p.m. and Sunday’s is at 3 p.m. There will be free pre-concert talks by O’Connor and guest artists one hour before each Lensic performance this season.
Go to lensic.org for tickets.
If you’re hungry after the Sunday show, there will be an artist’s dinner with violinist Jacobsen at La Casa Sena, 125 E. Palace Ave. Cost is $95 a person, with $40 tax deductible.

Agentes de la Patrulla Fronteriza tienen la moral por el piso

Texto completo: La vida como agente de la Patrulla Fronteriza (CBP) es insoportable desde que Donald Trump es presidente de Estados Unidos.
Un reporte del New York Times, recoge testimonios sobre lo poco llevadero que ha sido el trabajo de cientos de agentes desde que las políticas antiinmigrantes de Trump se aplican.
Varios reconocieron que están cansados de ser llamados “asesinos de niños” o “vendidos” por los ciudadanos. Algunos solamente comen su almuerzo en restaurantes “amigables con la Patrulla Fronteriza “.
El reportaje, el principal de la edición dominical del diario neoyorquino, también revela que la agencia tiene que lidiar con decenas de renuncias.
“Enjaular personas por actividades que no eran violentas me comía vivo”, dijo un hombre de Arizona que renunció hace un año.
El exagente Chris Harris, que estuvo 21 años en la CBP dijo que lo más difícil para ellos ha sido pasar de ser un grupo al que nadie le daba importancia a uno odiado por la población.
“La moral era pobre en el pasado, pero ahora está en un abismo. Conozco a muchos que quieren irse “, dijo Harris al Times.
La naturaleza del trabajo ha pasado de vigilar la frontera en puntos específicos a atender emergencias médicas y proveer alimentos a bebés, entre otros ejemplos.
La CBP además sufre con problemas de reclutamiento. El artículo dice que tiene 1,800 agentes menos de lo esperado. Agentes se quejan de la falta de infraestructura o dinero para operar lo que ellos asocian como una crisis humanitaria en la frontera.
Un gran número de agentes lamenta la separación de menores o la detención en jaulas de personas enfermas.

Texto completo: El presidente Donald Trump ha salido este domingo en defensa de Brett Kavanaugh, el juez la Corte Suprema señalado por conducta sexual indebida . Trump ha animado a Kavanaugh a demandar por injurias y asegura que, en caso contrario, el Departamento de Justicia puede salir en defensa del juez.
Tras una investigación de The New York Times que vio la luz este sábado, varios precandidatos demócratas han pedido un juicio político para Kavanaugh . El reportaje de The Times es el borrador de un libro que publicarán en breve periodistas del diario neoyorquino y que asegura confirmar los argumentos de Deborah Ramirez , compañera de universidad del actual juez.
Ramirez afirma que Kavanaugh le mostró el pene durante una fiesta con alcohol cuando ambos eran estudiantes . Al menos siete personas, entre ellas la madre de Ramirez, aseguraron a los periodistas que habían oído hablar de dicha conducta indebida de Kavanaugh antes de que este se convirtiera en juez. El juez negó las acusaciones durante su audiencia de confirmación en el Senado el pasado otoño.
La nota de The Times también revela una cuenta que se hace eco de la historia de Ramirez. El también antiguo compañero del juez en la Universidad de Yale describe cómo Kavanaugh empujaba durante una fiesta sus partes privadas hacia las manos de una compañera . Según el diario, el hombre informó sobre el incidente a senadores y al FBI pero la agencia no investigó.
Algunos d emócratas que se enfrentan a Donald Trump en las elecciones de 2020 dieron su opinión sobre la investigación.
“Las revelaciones de hoy confirman lo que ya sabíamos: durante su audiencia, Kavanaugh enfrentó acusaciones creíbles y probablemente mintió al Congreso”, dijo el senador Bernie Sanders .
The revelations today confirm what we already knew: During his hearing, Kavanaugh faced credible accusations and likely lied to Congress. I support any appropriate constitutional mechanism to hold him accountable.
— Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) September 15, 2019
“Brett Kavanaugh mintió al Senado de Estados Unidos y, lo que es más importante, al pueblo estadounidense. Debe someterse a un juicio político”, sentenció Kamala Harris , miembro del Comité Judicial.
I sat through those hearings. Brett Kavanaugh lied to the U.S. Senate and most importantly to the American people. He was put on the Court through a sham process and his place on the Court is an insult to the pursuit of truth and justice.
He must be impeached.
— Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) September 15, 2019
“Confirmación no es exoneración. Y estas nuevas revelaciones son inquietantes. Igual que el hombre que lo nombró, Kavanaugh debería enfrentar un juicio político”, dijo la senadora Elizabeth Warren también en Twitter”.
Last year the Kavanaugh nomination was rammed through the Senate without a thorough examination of the allegations against him. Confirmation is not exoneration, and these newest revelations are disturbing. Like the man who appointed him, Kavanaugh should be impeached.
— Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) September 15, 2019
Otros candidatos demócratas como Beto O’Rourke, Amy Klobuchar o Julián Castro también se pronunciaron al respecto. A todos ellos, el presidente Trump les contestó llamándoles “demócratas de izquierda radical” y culpándoles (junto a los “medios ineptos”) de perseguir a Kavanaugh. “¡Solo quieren asustarlo para que se vuelva liberal!”, sentenció.
Brett Kavanaugh should start suing people for libel, or the Justice Department should come to his rescue. The lies being told about him are unbelievable. False Accusations without recrimination. When does it stop? They are trying to influence his opinions. Can’t let that happen!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 15, 2019

Hey, Fed, cutting interest rates more will hurt, not help the economy

Resumen: Is the Fed bonkers? Does it really believe cutting interest rates more boosts borrowing? Are you really hot to lend your savings long-term at 1%?

Texto completo: Hey Federal Reserve Board: Pay attention! Everyone fears the “inverted yield curve” – where short-term interest rates exceed long-term rates. So you contemplate cutting short-term rates. OK, but you’re ignoring bigger basics. Dump all those bonds you idiotically bought under your ill-conceived “Quantitative dis-Easing” (QE) programs. Get real.
You should worry about an inverted curve. Why? Banking’s core business has always been borrowing at short-term rates to fund long-term loans. The higher long rates are above short rates, then the more profitable future lending is. So, then, banks become more eager to lend, they loan more – and to customers who need the loans more. No spread. Fewer loans.
So, many pundits urge cutting short rates. That’s understandable! Convention claims lower prices spur demand. If you cut the price of borrowing – shouldn’t you get more of it?
But that’s demand-side thinking.
Wait, negative interest rates? Trump wants Fed to cut interest rates to zero or below. Here's what it could mean for you.
New car prices: Why buying a new car is more expensive than ever
But price and quantity are determined by demand and supply together. In this economic cycle the supply side of monetary policy has been hugely stronger than the demand side. We already have super low rates. Everywhere! If these aren’t low enough, heaven help us. Excessively low rates are why the yield curve inverted in the first place. Not because the Fed jacked up short rates, fighting inflation, like every cycle before. But because long rates plunged globally. The 30-year U. S. bond yield is just over 2%. Japanese 15-year bonds have negative yields. All German government rates are negative.
Yet these overly cheap rates aren’t spurring massive lending anywhere. Global money supply growth has decelerated since 2012. We’ve had low-interest-rate tight money. Are central bankers bonkers? Do they really believe cutting further boosts borrowing? Are you really hot to lend your savings long term at 1%?
Cutting short rates alone isn’t adequate. It’s still low-interest-rate tight money. As Europe shows, lower than low doesn’t get it on. European negative short rates force Europe’s banks to charge savers for deposits. You wanna be Europe? Cutting further hurts, doesn’t help, creating even less lending and slower growth.
Many stupidly say cutting short-term rates reduces long rates, stimulating corporate and homebuyer borrowing. If so, loan growth should have zoomed during QE’s introduction, when the Fed forced long rates lower by buying trillions of long-term bonds. It didn’t. Lending crawled, increasing only when they tapered their bond buying.
Bonkers central bankers can’t fathom that the overall loan price, or average interest rate, is less important now than the availability and quantity of loans. Supply matters. Here and overseas, central bankers should stimulate monetary supply. They should steepen the yield curve by selling those bonds they never should have bought and letting long rates rise. Then lenders will want to lend.
And I don’t mean slowly. Do a quick disgorgement here and overseas. Last week’s ECB decision by Mario Draghi to restart its QE only drags down Europe. He should sell the ECB’s bonds, handing that legacy to incoming ECB head Christine Lagarde —creating supply sanity. The Bank of England and Japan should do this, too. Return central bank balance sheets to historic normality by letting long rates rise. They couldn’t soar, because we haven’t much inflation. But they’d rise enough to re-steepen yield curves globally – and ignite lending.
Free-flowing money would boost business investment virtually everywhere that corporate capital expenditure has struggled. Long-shelved projects of corporate borrowers would finally get the green light. Homebuyers, too. Economies would accelerate. Stocks would love it.
So how about it, Fed? Ignore your low-interest rate tight money. Ignore the demand side. Let loan and money growth accelerate. Sell those trillions of bonds you never should have bought.

Texto completo: The Ragin' Cajuns athletic community is mourning the death of Gene Bacque, a UL sports Hall of Fame inductee who became famous for his professional baseball career in Japan.
According to Baseball-Reference.com, Bacque was "arguably the most successful American pitcher in the history of Nippon Pro Baseball."
The former Cajuns pitching coach was 82.
"The Louisiana Ragin' Cajuns Department of Athletics extends its deepest condolences to the family of Gene Bacque, a 2013 inductee into our school's Hall of Fame," UL said in a statement Saturday.
"Gene was a standout baseball player for the Ragin' Cajuns, and went on to a remarkable overseas career.
"He returned as a member of the program's coaching staff, and in his retirement was a valued member of our alumni community," the statement continued. "Our thoughts and prayers are with Bacque family during this time."
According to his UL Hall of Fame bio, Bacque pitched for the then-USL baseball team in 1956 and '57, winning first-team All-Gulf States Conference honors in his '57 sophomore year.
According to the bio, Bacque was drafted by the Detroit Tigers and "spent four seasons in the minor leagues before taking his talents to an international stage in the Nippon Pro Baseball league in Japan in 1962."
Bacque "pitched in Japan for seven years, and at that time was the best-known American player in the Nippon League."
Bacque made it to as high as the AAA level in American baseball, last playing there for Hawaii of the Pacific Coast League in 1962.
He spent most of his time in Japan with the Harshin Tigers, winning — according to UL — more than 100 games ... "including a standout season in 1964 when he finished with a 29-9 record and a 1.88 earned run average in 353 1/3 innings of work."
According to Baseball Reference, Bacque had "what he calls '(the) highlight of my career in Japan" in 1965 when he pitched a no-hitter against Yomiuri. The next-to-last batter was (famous Japanese slugger) Sadahara Oh in the nationally televised game."
From Baseball Reference:
"In 1968 Bacque made his final All-Star team. He finished 4th in the Central in ERA (2.19, his second best in Japan) and his 142 strikeouts were his second-best for Hanshin but he went just 13-14 with continued poor support.
"Bacque also got into his biggest controversy in Japan that year. With Oh at the plate in a key situation, Bacque went ahead 0-1 then threw one inside. He came inside with the following pitch as well and Oh began criticizing Bacque.
"The Giants' dugout then began to empty and Bacque was knocked down in the fight and broke his thumb punching Yomiuri coach Hiroshi Arakawa; the imprint of Arakawa's forehead was permanently embedded on Bacque's knuckle.
"Masatoshi Gondo relieved Bacque — and promptly hit Oh to restart the melee. Bacque was fined, missed the rest of the season and after the season he was traded to the Kintetsju Buffaloes."
Decades later, Bacque remained well-known and highly respected in the country where he was so successful.
According to a profile of Bacque written in 2018 by The Daily Advertiser's Glenn Guilbeau, in Japan "They keep bowing to Gene Bacque, a Cajun farm boy from Scott who ... left a lasting mark in more ways than one."
He also was profiled by the New York Times in 2018.
"Only in recent years," Guilbeau wrote, "is Bacque's body of work being touched.
"Why do they keep bowing at me? It's strange," Bacque asked a fellow American player from Pittsburgh on the Hanshin Tigers in Japan back in the early '60s, according to Guilbeau's profile. "He told me the Japanese people really respected people older than them.
"There was so much respect from the younger people. It was like I was a god. That was the culture shock. If you were older, they'd bow. After a while, you almost got tired of it. They'd do whatever you wanted."
Bacque had 24 complete games and more than 200 strikeouts in '64, according to UL, "and was named winner of the prestigious Sawamura Award — the equivalent of Major League Baseball's Cy Young Award."
"Bows became bountiful for Bacque in 1964 when he went 29-9 with a 1.88 ERA and a Hanshin team record for foreigners of 200 strikeouts in 353 and one-third innings," Guilbeau wrote. "That record stood until 2014 when Randy Messenger of Reno, Nevada, struck out 226 for Hanshin."
Bacque earned his bachelor's degree from then-USL in 1962, before going to Japan.
After retiring, according to his Cajuns Hall of Fame bio, he joined the then-USL coaching staff and served "as a Cajun assistant and pitching coach under both Bob Banna and Don Lockwood from 1971-78."

Texto completo: What's Streaming
HELLO, PRIVILEGE. IT'S ME, CHELSEA Stream on Netflix. In 2016, the comedian Chelsea Handler shifted toward documentary storytelling with her four-part series, "Chelsea Does," to explore questions she had about marriage, Silicon Valley, drugs and racism. In his review of that show for The New York Times, Neil Genzlinger likened it to documentaries "that ramble and lack focus and are more akin to visiting with a topic than to making a point about it." But Handler has decided to delve back into the subject of race in "Hello, Privilege," a full-length documentary in which this former talk show host confronts the ways she's directly benefited from white privilege and the way others experience it. She sets out to meet with ordinary Americans, community leaders and fellow comedians like Kevin Hart and Tiffany Haddish, to have tough discussions about how those like herself can be better allies to people of color.
What's on TV
COMEDY CENTRAL ROAST OF ALEC BALDWIN 10 p.m. on Comedy Central. At this stage in his career, Alec Baldwin is perhaps best known for impersonating President Trump on "Saturday Night Live" for laughs. Now he will be the one in the hot seat (just as Trump was in 2010) for one of Comedy Central's famous roasts. There's certainly a lot of material that Robert De Niro, Jeff Ross, Caitlyn Jenner and the other participants will have to work with, like Baldwin's arrest last year on charges of assaulting a man in a parking dispute and his calling his daughter, who was 11 at the time, "a thoughtless little pig" in 2007.
UNDERCOVER CHEERLEADER 8 p.m. on Lifetime. To cap off Cheer, Rally, Kill, Lifetime's monthlong back-to-school movie series, the network will air this film, which stars Kayla Wallace as a high school student who joins the cheerleading squad as an undercover journalist. As she starts working on an article to expose the cruel inner workings of the team, someone starts attacking its members. The film also stars Maddie Phillips and Andre Anthony.
WARIGAMI 8 p.m. on The CW. Paper is really only useful in a fight if you're playing rock, paper, scissors. But in this special, starring Emily Piggford and Kai Bradbury, paper comes in handy for kami-jin warriors, descendants of an ancient Japanese people who can turn the material into deadly weapons. The two-hour samurai drama follows Wendy Ohata (Piggford) as she begins to uncover her new powers as a kami-jin.
COUNTRY MUSIC 8 p.m. on PBS. In this eight-part, 16-hour documentary series, which was directed by Ken Burns, more than 80 country music artists come together to discuss the way this genre evolved over the 20th century, from its humble beginnings as songs sung in America's farmland to its performances before mainstream audiences at the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville. The first episode traces the music back to its early roots in Old World ballads, blues songs and Bible hymns, as well as the way technology helped to broadcast it to new markets across the country.

Trust Our Weather Forecasters, Not Trump

Texto completo: All through the summer of 1978, Harold Gibson, the meteorologist in charge of the National Weather Service in New York, would recall, he was "sweating blood."
It was the sweat of an unknown civil servant who took his duty to protect life and property seriously, and who had just been told a terrible secret: A tall building in the middle of Manhattan was in danger of falling over in a high wind.
For me, a student reporter hearing about the episode from Mr. Gibson a year later, it was an unforgettable lesson on why it matters that we are able to trust government weather people to give us the forecasts straight.
That's also why President Trump's incorrect tweet warning of hurricane risk to Alabama -- and the apparently hand-altered map he later displayed to justify it, and his administration's ham-handed attempt to undermine correct weather forecasts by government scientists -- cannot be written off as mere Twitter slapstick gone haywire. So much depends on the frail membranes of credibility.
On Aug. 8, 1978, three men arrived at Mr. Gibson's office in Rockefeller Center. Two were with the Red Cross, in charge of disaster preparations. The third was a structural engineer, Leslie E. Robertson, an expert in tall buildings who had been hired by Citibank to review the strength of its shining new addition to the Manhattan skyline, the Citicorp Center in Midtown.
They wanted to know the probability of Midtown Manhattan being buffeted by a 75-mile-per-hour wind for five minutes, and how far in advance they would learn that it was coming.
As Mr. Gibson later related, he told them of two possibilities. One would be a severe thunderstorm that could last as long as five minutes, perhaps with no more than an hour's notice.
"There's another situation -- less likely, but still possible," Mr. Gibson told them. "A hurricane has winds of at least 75 miles per hour, sustained for hours." That would not sneak up on them: Storms would be tracked as they formed and moved up the coast.
Why, he wondered, did they want to know?
"They said, due to design error, construction error, I forget which -- due to screw-ups, why, the building would fall over if that sustained wind were to occur," Mr. Gibson said.
When it opened in 1977, the Citicorp Center was the seventh-tallest building in the world. It contained more than 40 million pounds of structural steel and stood along Lexington Avenue from 53rd Street to 54th, one of the most crowded areas in the country. (The building is now called 601 Lexington.)
"They said there would be a domino effect if that were to happen," Mr. Gibson told me. "The dominoes were already standing -- the buildings. They were talking about 18 blocks being wiped out."
A few months earlier, an engineering student had inquired about the calculations for wind loads used by the structural engineer who designed the tower, William LeMessurier. As he would tell the story, this prompted him to check his firm's work. It turned out that the skyscraper had weaknesses that would make it vulnerable to collapse in a storm that occurred, on average, every 16 years in New York. That meant that in any given year, the building had a 1 in 16 possibility of facing a destructive storm: a 6 percent chance of failure.
All this came into focus just as peak hurricane season was beginning.
Mr. LeMessurier told his client, the bank. Mr. Robertson was hired to provide a second opinion. He needed to demonstrate the urgency of making repairs to senior executives, Mr. Robertson told me.
As described by others, he stood a clipboard on end and told the executives:
"Gentlemen, if the wind blows -- "
Then he let the clipboard fall over and smack onto the table.
"That's what will happen to your building," Mr. Robertson said.
One day after the meeting at the Weather Service in Rockefeller Center, the city's three main daily newspapers went on strike for 88 days. Very few people knew what was going on at Citicorp, much less how serious it was.
Most citizens turn over the job of measuring risk to the government, which in 1978 meant people like Mr. Gibson, just as it does in 2019. Civil servants track the weather and make the calls that mean the difference between life and death. As Michael Lewis writes in his book, "The Fifth Risk," figuring out how to convey warnings at the right moment -- to be trustworthy -- is central to the National Weather Service's mission of keeping people alive.
That summer, Mr. Gibson contacted the National Hurricane Center in Florida and storm forecasters in Kansas City, asking for extra notice of serious weather bending toward New York.
Unable to sleep much, he watched a movie on television one night about an astronomer who figured out that an asteroid was going to hit his small town. No one believed him.
Construction workers arrived and began ripping open the interior walls at Citicorp Center. Working at night, they welded steel plates onto giant chevrons that had previously been bolted together, strengthening the building.
They were still early in the project on Sept. 1 when a storm formed into a hurricane off Florida and began moving up the coast. Then it veered out to sea. Mr. Gibson thought about the ridiculed astronomer in the movie. What if Mr. Gibson were to suddenly announce that Midtown Manhattan was in danger of being destroyed by ... wind? It was what Mr. Lewis in his book classified as the most dangerous risk, the kind that no one could imagine.
"I was the federal official who would have to make the call to evacuate," Mr. Gibson recalled. "What if I gave that order and no one believed me?"
He knew that was unlikely, as the mayor's office had also been told about the problem. Still, graveyards are full of people who blew off warnings about hurricanes and tornadoes. And really: Midtown Manhattan was going to topple?
The repairs were made. The building did not fall down. The newspapers came back from strike. Mr. Gibson relaxed.
I never forgot how seriously he took his job. In 1980, I sent an account of these events to a magazine. The rejection letter said something like: "This is an interesting story. However, since the building did NOT fall down, it is not newsworthy."
Maybe so. But the seriousness of Mr. Gibson and those who have followed him is as newsworthy, and worthy of safeguarding, as ever. So is their credibility.

Biden did great! Or was he terrible?

Texto completo: Twitter, we are often rightly reminded, is not real life.
But after Thursday night's debate, it seemed to inch closer to reality than what I was hearing in mainstream media.
Especially when it came to evaluating the performance of former vice president Joe Biden.
For CNN's Chris Cillizza, Biden was "strong and presidential," though not flawless. Barack Obama's veep was particularly good when it mattered, said the cable network analyst: during the first few minutes of the debate, when the audience was the biggest.
Cillizza proclaimed Biden the main winner of the third Democratic debate, a three-hour marathon of mind-numbing bloviation in Houston.
For Mollie O'Reilly, editor at large of Commonweal magazine - well, not so much.
Linking to a transcript of Biden's incomprehensible answer to a question about reparations for slavery from ABC's Linsey Davis, O'Reilly tweeted: "Biden fans, please, read this. He can't do it. Your princess is in another castle." The Q&A link was to Ashley Feinberg of Slate who called it "one of the top ten hardest things I've ever tried to transcribe."
And, truly, the response belongs in some sort of Bizarre Answer Hall of Fame, drifting from an apparently unintended insult to low-income parents ("they don't know quite what to do") to a now-famous mention of record players as parenting tool to, yes, Venezuelan government leadership.
Nor was it just the high-profile tweeters with large followings making this point.
Max Coleman, a PhD student in sociology at Indiana University, tweeted: "When asked what to do about the legacy of slavery, Biden said we should bring social workers into black homes 'to help them deal with how to raise their children.' (!) How is this not disqualifying?"
But back in the world of mainstream national media, Biden was looking solid.
Frank Bruni at the New York Times had the highest praise for Elizabeth Warren but thought that Biden's performance would allow him to move on in good form: "Nothing on Thursday night broke his stride, such as it is."
And Dan Balz of The Washington Post said Biden had "the kind of evening he needed."
He "delivered the kind of performance his supporters have been waiting for - combative when needed and in the thick of the action throughout."
And over at Fox News, pollster and analyst Doug Schoen was effusive: Biden "was the night's big winner."
The former vice president "exhibited a much-needed display of strength and preparedness," Schoen wrote. "He compellingly and convincingly delivered his core message of restoring, protecting and rebuilding the Obama-Biden record."
Many viewers had moved on by the time Biden did some of his worst blathering.
As one close family member of mine texted, with more than half of the three hours left to go: "Right on cue, 9:20 and I'm checked out from the debate."
Of course, it's ridiculous to describe Twitter, in all its ragged glory, as unified. Far from it. And, granted, there was far from complete agreement on Biden's Big Win even among the highest-profile mainstream sources opining on the biggest platforms:
Nate Silver, the data guru and editor of FiveThirtyEight.com, while calling the whole debate a bit of a letdown, offered this on the former vice president:
"As was the pattern in the previous debate, Biden started out fairly strong and got worse as the night went along, and the evening will probably most be remembered for his rambling answer to a moderator's question about the legacy of slavery."
My theory for why Twitter was so much tougher on Biden than the big-time commentators is simple enough. It's the difference between caring most about who is winning the horse race, and who actually deserves to.
And then there's this: There's room for more extremes of opinion there, among the multitudes of hot takes.
The real answer, I suppose, is to have watched the whole debate yourself.
But that's an onerous assignment: a piece of homework most Americans are quite sensibly not prepared to take on.
And because Biden certainly was not disqualified - or apparently knocked off his front-runner position - he lives to fight another day.
And another. And another. (There are nine more Democratic debates to go.)
There's plenty of time, in other words, to make your own judgment. Or at least decide whom you want to believe.

Texto completo: MOSCOW - In a nationwide crackdown to prevent discontent in Moscow from spreading to far-flung regions, Russian security forces Thursday raided and searched hundreds of homes and offices across the country of activists affiliated with opposition leader Aleksei A. Navalny.
The raids, the biggest operation yet against Navalny and his supporters, were carried out in more than 40 cities and towns as part of a criminal money laundering investigation announced in August by the authorities against his Anti-Corruption Foundation. The foundation has been the vanguard of recent street protests in Moscow that led to the arrests of more than 2,000 people.
Navalny issued a statement denouncing the raids as the biggest police operation, in geographical reach, in Russia's modern history and a clear attempt to "intimidate" and "demoralize." He said security officials from the police, the National Guard and the Federal Security Service, or FSB, had simultaneously raided more than 200 sites in 41 towns and cities.
Also raided as part of the same investigation were the homes of activists in Golos, an independent organization that monitors elections.
Navalny, the highest-profile Russian opponent of President Vladimir Putin, has alarmed the authorities by trying to expand his reach beyond Moscow, traditionally a center of opposition sentiment.
Putin has generally enjoyed strong support in regions where many people, unlike Muscovites, get their news primarily from state-controlled television channels that do little more than praise the president.
Putin's allies suffered significant losses in Moscow City Council elections on Sunday, even after officials kept many opposition candidates off the ballot. But pro-Kremlin candidates performed well elsewhere, winning all 16 regional governor races despite a slow but steady decline in living standards in many parts of the country.
Leonid Volkov, a senior aide to Navalny, described Thursday's raids as an "act of mass political repression" on his Facebook page and said that they signaled a "desperate but hopeless" effort by the authorities to stop future elections from eroding the authority of pro-Kremlin forces. Putin's party, United Russia, is so unpopular that many of its members who competed in Sunday's elections did so as independents.
The money laundering case against Navalny's organization, announced in early August, is widely viewed as transparently political. It is focused on allegations that his foundation funded its work with 1 billion rubles - around $15 million - "obtained by criminal means."

Texto completo: Donald Trump marked the anniversary of 9/11 by repeating several lies about his own actions on that day. But that wasn’t his only concern. He also spent part of the day writing a series of tweets excoriating Federal Reserve officials as “Boneheads” and demanding that they immediately put into effect emergency measures to stimulate the economy — emergency measures that are normally only implemented in the face of a severe crisis.
Trump’s diatribe was revealing in two ways. First, it’s now clear that he’s in full-blown panic over the failure of his economic policies to deliver the promised results. Second, he’s clueless about why his policies aren’t working, or about anything else involving economic policy.
Before I get to the economics, let’s talk about one indicator of Trump’s cluelessness: his remarks about federal debt.
In addition to demanding that the Fed cut interest rates below zero, Trump declared that “we should then start to refinance our debt,” because “the USA should always be paying the lowest rate.” Observers were left scratching their heads, wondering what he was talking about.
Actually, however, it’s fairly obvious. Trump thinks that federal debt is like a business loan, which you can pay down early to take advantage of lower interest rates. He’s clearly unaware that federal debt actually consists of bonds, which can’t be prepaid (which is one reason interest rates on federal debt are always lower than, say, rates on home mortgages). That is, he imagines that the government’s finances can be managed as if the U.S. were a casino or a golf course, and it never occurred to him to ask anyone at Treasury whether that’s how it works.
But back to the economy. Why is Trump panicking?
After all, while the economy is slowing, we’re not in a recession, and it’s by no means clear that a recession is even on the horizon. There’s nothing in the data that would justify radical monetary stimulus — stimulus, by the way, that Republicans, including Trump, denounced during the Obama years, when the economy really needed it.
Furthermore, despite Trump’s claims that the Fed has somehow done something crazy, monetary policy has actually been looser than Trump’s own economic team expected when making their rosy forecasts.
In the summer of 2018 the White House’s economic projections envisioned that this year three-month interest rates would average 2.7%, while 10-year rates would be 3.2%. The actual rates as I write this are 1.9% and 1.7%, respectively.
But while there’s no economic emergency, Trump apparently feels that he’s facing a political emergency. He expected a booming economy to be his big winning issue next year. If, as now seems likely, economic performance is mediocre at best, he’s in deep trouble.
Remember, Trump’s two signature economic policies were his 2017 tax cut and his rapidly escalating trade war with China. The first was supposed to lead to a decade or more of rapid economic growth, while the second was supposed to revive U.S. manufacturing.
In reality, however, the tax cut delivered at most a couple of quarters of higher growth. More specifically, huge tax breaks for corporations haven’t delivered the promised surge in wages and business investment; instead, corporations used the windfall to buy back stocks and pay higher dividends.
At the same time, the trade war has turned out to be a major drag on the economy — bigger than many people, myself included, expected. Until last fall the general expectation was that Trump would deal with China the way he dealt with Mexico: make a few mainly cosmetic changes to existing arrangements, claim victory, and move on. Once it became clear that he was really serious about confrontation, however, business confidence began falling, dragging investment down with it.
And voters have noticed: Trump’s approval rating on the economy, while still higher than his overall approval, has started to decline. Hence the panicky demands that the Fed pull out all the stops.
But while Trump realizes that he’s in trouble, there’s no indication that he understands why. He’s not the kind of person who ever admits, even to himself, that he made mistakes; his instinct is always to blame someone else while doubling down on his failed policies.
Even actions that look like a slight policy softening, like his announcement of a two-week delay in implementing some China tariffs, betray a deep incomprehension of the problem — which has as much to do with his capriciousness as with the tariffs per se. Policy zigzags, even if they involve delaying tariffs, just add to the will-he-or-won’t-he uncertainty that’s causing companies to put investment on hold.
So what happens next? Trump could reverse course, and do what most people expected a year ago, reaching a deal with China that more or less restores the status quo. But that would be a de facto admission of defeat — and at this point it’s not clear why the Chinese would trust him to honor any such deal past Election Day. The fact is that when it comes to economic policy, Trump has trapped himself in a bad place.

Texto completo: Daniel Johnston, enigmatic indie singer-songwriter
Daniel Johnston, a singer-songwriter and outsider artist who battled mental health issues while recording hundreds of humorous, bittersweet songs that made him a near-mythical figure in indie rock, died Wednesday at his home in Waller, Texas, a farming town outside Houston. He was 58.
His brother and manager, Dick, said Johnston had been in a hospital with kidney problems and was released a day before his death "feeling good and everything," when he apparently suffered a heart attack overnight.
Johnston had manic depression and schizophrenia, and he faced increasing health problems in recent years, notably diabetes and hydrocephalus, a buildup of fluid in the brain. Although he said he hoped to continue performing, he embarked in 2017 on what was billed as his "final tour," joined by a backing band that included members of Wilco, Fugazi and Built to Spill - a roster of indie rock all-stars that spoke to his reputation as a master lyricist and intimate, uninhibited singer.
With a high-pitched voice and mild lisp, Johnston bared his soul in folksy songs about unrequited love, existential dread, his affection for the Beatles and the thrills of a speeding motorcycle. Emerging on Austin's underground music scene in the mid-1980s, he used a $59 Sanyo boombox to record himself on acoustic guitar, organ and piano, and released cassette tapes decorated with his own ink and marker artwork.
His music was unabashedly simple - "the amazing thing is half these songs are the same three chords," Built to Spill musician Doug Martsch once said - but drew a cult following, notably after Kurt Cobain of Nirvana was photographed in a T-shirt bearing the cover of Johnston's 1983 album "Hi, How Are You."
Johnston was covered by Tom Waits, Beck and Lana Del Rey; collaborated with singer Jad Fair of Half Japanese and guitarist Paul Leary of the Butthole Surfers; and was the subject of an award-winning 2005 documentary, "The Devil and Daniel Johnston."
But Johnston never quite achieved the mainstream success that he said he wanted - only one of his approximately 20 full-length albums, 1994's "Fun," was released by a major label.
"I never thought I'd make it with the music that much," he told The New York Times. "I thought I was going to be famous as a cartoonist."

Texto completo: One hundred years from now, St. Louis University Hospital officials may open the time capsule that hospital officials buried Thursday, and maybe they will scratch their heads.
Inside they'll find a stethoscope, a blood pressure cuff, pagers and even four vacuum-sealed turkey sandwiches.
"They say white bread has a lot of preservatives," St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson joked to the crowd of about three dozen people who gathered in the hospital lobby still under construction at Grand Boulevard and Chouteau Avenue. "I probably won't be able to see how those preservatives have held the bread up."
The ceremony celebrated the home stretch of construction for the new SSM Health St. Louis University Hospital, which is set to open Sept. 1.
Krewson noted that the $550 million hospital is among $100 billion worth of projects recently completed or about to be completed in St. Louis.
The time capsule, made of composite plastic that's meant to withstand water and extreme temperatures, has 6 cubic feet of space. Employees and SSM Healthcare archivist Scott Grimwood managed to pack it with more than 150 items.
There are old hospital T-shirts, badges, a list of current hospital employees and the leadership organization chart, a map of the campus, and letters from present-day nurses and physicians to nurses and physicians of the future.
As for the turkey sandwiches? They're a trusty hospital staple, something always available to hungry nurses or patients after the hospital kitchens close.
"Basically, this is a gift to the future from the present staff of St. Louis University Hospital," said Grimwood, referring to the contents of the box.
The sandwiches expired Thursday.
Grimwood helped create a similar time capsule for a hospital in Mount Vernon and opened one last year pulled from the cornerstone of a convent behind St. Mary's Hospital in Richmond Heights. That one contained newspapers, religious medallions and prayer cards.
The capsule buried Thursday also includes a Stanley Cup flag to honor the Blues' win, two lapel pins from Krewson, copies of Thursday's New York Times and Post-Dispatch, and photographs of the current hospital from the past 88 years.
Hospital president Steven Scott contributed a hard copy of the 589-page academic affiliation agreement just signed between the university and SSM Healthcare. Robert Wilmott, a Cardinals fan and dean of St. Louis University's School of Medicine, contributed a baseball jersey.
Grimwood said he does not think there is a time capsule buried at the old hospital building, because one was not mentioned in accounts of the 1931 cornerstone ceremony.
As ceremony attendees waited inside, workers stepped outside into the 90-degree heat to bury the capsule just to the left of the main entrance. An engraved slab marks the spot.
The Rev. Christopher Collins, assistant to the president of mission and identity at the university, offered a blessing for the time capsule and construction project.
"I'm reminded each prayer is a time capsule that we give to God," he said. "You never know when, where and how God will answer it, but he will answer it."

Horse racing's unjustified use of power

Texto completo: The Kentucky Derby favorite flunks a drug test less than three weeks before the race.
Solution: stall.
How else to explain the lack of urgency after Justify tested positive for scopolamine in April 2018? How else to explain an eight-day gap between regulators' receipt of lab results from the Santa Anita Derby and their notification of trainer Bob Baffert? How else to interpret last spring's timeline except to think the California Horse Racing Board deliberately dawdled to safeguard Justify's Run for the Roses?
"Curious at best," said Barry Irwin, owner of 2011 Derby winner Animal Kingdom. "But I'm not surprised. The California Horse Racing Board has a history of hiding and covering up stuff, and it's never improved. It's part of the culture. It's like it doesn't matter who the people are. It's just the same crazy stuff."
While Baffert, his lawyer, Winstar Farm President Elliot Walden and former CHRB chairman Chuck Winner all sought to cast doubt on the New York Times' detailed reporting Thursday, none of them attempted to account for the suspicious delay that contributed to a Triple Crown campaign.
By the time Baffert was told of Justify's positive sample, he was able to invoke his right to seek confirmation from a second test reasonably confident the result would not be available before the race was run. Sure enough, Justify's split sample positive came back on May 8, three days after Baffert's fifth Derby win.
Perhaps the CHRB might have considered disqualifying Justify from the Santa Anita Derby had the horse finished further back at Churchill Downs. But to do so before the Derby would have prevented Justify from having enough points to qualify for the biggest race going.
To believe a board closely tied to Baffert was capable of such a move is to believe in equal justice from committees made of cronies.
Ten years earlier, trainer Jerry Hollendorfer had a horse disqualified and a fine imposed for a scopolamine finding on the California circuit. If you perceive a double standard here, you perceive correctly.
"It's troubling to no end," said Hollendorfer's attorney, Drew Couto. "I'm not trying to cast aspersions on Bob Baffert. What troubles me as a lawyer is you're supposed to apply the rules in a consistent fashion so everyone is treated in the same way.
"When they're not applied consistently, it creates concerns. ... I'm confident that there's a sound explanation, but the way it was handled undermines people's confidence. Now's not the time to undermine confidence."
Irwin had a similar experience in 1994, forced to return $66,000 in winnings after Lady Blessington was disqualified from Santa Anita's Buena Vista Stakes.
As Irwin recalled, Lady Blessington's drug test showed 35 nanograms of scopolamine, less than one-ninth the amount reportedly measured in Justify.
"She was (a) French filly who I think was half canine," Irwin said of Lady Blessington. "In her bedding were these pieces of scopolamine. They were like tree bark. She would chew on them and then line 'em up in front of her stall so in the morning, when the groom got there, it was like a dog showing his bones.
"I can't imagine any other horse ingesting more of that substance than her, and here's this Baffert horse (with 300)."
How to explain the discrepancy? Why would Baffert's horse be treated differently?
"That horse meant a lot to California racing," Irwin said. "And that was a prime motivator. Plus, Baffert is so well connected. ... He's like Teflon."
Winner, whose term as CHRB chairman has expired since last spring, owns a stake in some of the horses in Baffert's stable.
CHRB vice chairman Madeline Auerbach has bred horses in partnership with Baffert.
Some states have laws against these kind of conflicts of interests. Of course, some governmental bodies do their business in the light of day. The decision to drop Justify's failed drug case was made in executive session, behind closed doors, more than a month after his Triple Crown was complete. It was not made public until the New York Times's story was posted Wednesday evening.
"If they were just transparent, if they just came out with it in the beginning, it would blow over in a couple of days," Irwin said. "Hide it, find out later, that's when you get the scandal.
"All these guys think if you keep the lid on stuff you'll be fine. It doesn't work. You can't keep the lid on anything in this world."

Texto completo: 'Raise Hell' showcases Molly Ivins' wicked wit
With its wealth of examples of the wicked wit of its title subject, "Raise Hell: The Life and Times of Molly Ivins" is expectedly entertaining.
Along with that, this documentary, opening Friday at the Opera Plaza, inspiringly demonstrates, 12 years after Ivins' death, how peerless and prescient the political columnist and free-speech advocate remains.
Filmmaker Janice Engel, making her big-screen feature debut, combines photographs, clips from television and lecture appearances, and recent interviews with relatives, friends and admirers of Ivins - Rachel Maddow, Dan Rather and Cecile Richards, among them - in this conventional but engaging chronological portrait.
After opening with Ivins in jokester form (ridiculing "dumber than advertised" veep candidate Dan Quayle), Engel looks at Ivins' Houston childhood. The 1944-born Ivins had a conservative oil-executive father (we learn almost nothing about her mother) and, by age 12, stood 6 feet tall. She would soon learn to use her misfit status to her advantage.
She attended Smith College, interned at the Houston Chronicle, and got a master's degree so she could do serious reporting at a time when newswomen were assigned "food, fluff and fashion" stories. She wrote for the Minneapolis Tribune and, with Kaye Northcott, edited the Texas Observer.
The New York Times hired Ivins for her colorful writing style, only to consistently cramp it. Ivins hilariously relates how the Times would alter her prose. A man's "beer gut that belonged in the Smithsonian" became a "protuberant abdomen."
Ivins accepted an irresistible offer from the Dallas Times Herald: to write a column about whatever she wanted.
Her targets included George W. Bush, aka "Shrub"; Pat Buchanan and his Trumpish "security fence"; and Bill Clinton, a Democrat, whose welfare policy Ivins deemed a betrayal.
The persona she adopted, which included a Texas twang and a populist-liberal sensibility, helped Ivins deal with fame.
Engel also details challenges Ivins faced, including battles with alcoholism and breast cancer.
This isn't a particularly original or revelatory documentary. And one wishes that Engel had included more of Ivins' sharp condemnations of sexism.
But the film winningly celebrates Ivins' unique journalistic spirit and brilliance for saying dead-serious things about power-abusing politicians in ways that made people laugh.
The interviewees provide enlightening stories about Ivins, with subjects ranging from her conflicts with her father to her ability to drink male cohorts under the table and her fear that she couldn't be funny without alcohol.
Most impressive are her prophetic observations: about the U.S. occupation of Iraq, the effects of corporate money on politics, and government assertions that becoming a safer nation requires compromising freedom.
Ivins' detractors (and she had many) will disagree, but this documentary makes one want to see Ivins alive today, skewering the current powers that be.

The 10 best new shows coming to TV this fall

Texto completo: TV is about to become bigger this fall. A whole lot bigger.
In addition to the usual crop of new shows from broadcast networks, cable channels and streaming services, two new players will jump into the game in fall 2019: Apple TV+ and Disney+.
Disney will unveil "The Mandalorian," the first live-action TV show in the "Star Wars" franchise, with the service's Nov. 12 launch. Apple, which has not yet announced a debut date, is betting on star power, including Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon and Steve Carell in drama "The Morning Show."
And some old favorites will return, including the long-awaited third season of Netflix's "The Crown" ( Nov. 17), with Oscar-winner Olivia Colman stepping in the role of Queen Elizabeth II. Series such as ABC's long-running family sitcom "Modern Family" (Sept. 25) are also coming back for one last season.
To help you sort through this fall's avalanche of television, we chose the 10 most exciting new series.
'Undone' Amazon Prime (Sept. 13)
"BoJack Horseman" creator Raphael Bob-Waksberg joins forces with Kate Purdy ("Cougar Town") for this adult animated series that embraces darkness. "Undone" is a magical realist drama about Alma (Rose Salazar), a directionless woman in her late 20s who survives a terrible car accident and discovers she has an ability to move through time and communicate with her dead father. The series touches on themes of family history and self-destruction, and uses its animation to beautifully and render eerily realistic sketches of its talented cast, which includes Bob Odenkirk as Alma's father. The result is a series that deliberately lives in the uncanny valley, much like its protagonist.
'Country Music' PBS (Sept. 15, Sundays at 8 EDT/PDT; check local listings)
Because aKen Burns documentary is almost always a gripping, informative and gorgeously scored examination of American history, it's natural for the celebrated director to point his lens at country music, a uniquely American cultural phenomenon. The 18-hour, comprehensive look at the genre's rise genre is not just for diehard fans. It looks at the influences of African instruments and rhythm and blues, among others, includes interviews with dozens of artists and historians, and features an excellent soundtrack.
'Stumptown' ABC, Sept. 25 (Wednesdays at 10 EDT/PDT)
Cobie Smulders ("How I Met Your Mother") returns to TV with the butt-kicking moves she learned from her Marvel films ("The Avengers"). Except Dex, her damaged private investigator character on "Stumptown," drinks and gambles far more than S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Maria ever would. Based on a graphic novel, "Stumptown" which also stars Jake Johnson, follows Dex as she solves (and sometimes mildly commits) crimes and other cases in Portland, Oregon, while she takes care of her younger brother (Cole Sibus), who has Down syndrome, and tries not to gamble her way into poverty. The pilot episode deftly mixes action, drama and comedy, and Smulders remains the magnetic leading lady she was for nine years on "Mother."
'The Unicorn' CBS, Sept. 26 (Thursdays at 8:30 EDT/PDT)
This new comedy is not about mythical horse creatures, but rather Walton Goggins' Wade, a widower who's reluctantly re-entering the dating pool as a rare middle-aged "unicorn" because he's not divorced or a cheating husband, has his own loving family and is earnest. It's a great setup for great romantic comedy, and has a stellar cast, including Rob Corddry and Michaela Watkins, along with the adorable Goggins, who can make almost anything funny.
'The Politician' Netflix (Sept. 27)
Prolific creator Ryan Murphy's first Netflix series preserves his stylish flair. "The Politician" stars Ben Platt ("Pitch Perfect," "Dear Evan Hansen") as a pathologically driven high-school student who is convinced he will become president of the United States. The first step on his journey is president of his senior class, and he will do anything to win. Co-starring Gwyneth Paltrow as Platt's mother, "Politician" is more akin to early seasons of "Glee" than recent seasons of "American Horror Story;" "Politician" has just the right amount of surrealism and melodrama without going over the edge, at least in early episodes.
'Back to Life' Showtime, (Oct. 6, Sundays at 8:30 EDT/PDT)
Fans of dark British comedies "Fleabag" and "Catastrophe" will be drawn to this new series created by and starring Daisy Haggard ("Episodes"). The understated but affecting series follows Miri, a middle-aged woman who returns to her parents' house after 18 years in prison. "Life" is awkward, sweet, sad and witty, and wisely takes its time to unfurl Miri's past, initially withholding the reason she was sent to prison.
'Living With Yourself' Netflix (Oct. 18)
In this new comedy from "Daily Show" writer Timothy Greenberg, the great Paul Rudd stars as Miles, a depressed, struggling and unmotivated man who can't even seek fertility doctors. He seeks out an unconventional treatment for his malaise at a strip-mall spa, and receives much more than he bargained for. Without spoiling the first episode's major twist, let's just say the riotously smart series gives you a double dose of Rudd.
'Modern Love' Amazon (Oct. 18)
This effervescent romance, based on the New York Times column, is as sweet as apple pie without becoming sickly. "Love" is structured as an anthology series about love. That could mean a relationship between an overprotective doorman and an apartment resident, or someone with bipolar disorder worried about revealing it to their new flame. The joyful series stars Anne Hathaway, Tina Fey, John Slattery, Dev Patel and Cristin Millioti.
'High School Musical the Musical the Series' Disney+ (Nov. 12)
An extension of Disney Channel's "High School Musical" franchise, this mockumentary chronicles students' efforts to put on a production of the musical. The tongue-in-cheek approach offers enough new and old music to satisfy fans but creates modern new characters to anchor the stories. Aimed at teens (or nostalgic millennials) instead of Disney Channel's kid and tween audience, "High School" is self-aware and self-effacing. It does almost everything right that NBC's ill-fated "Rise" did wrong, and is genuinely funny. "The Mandalorian" (which was unavailable to preview) will get much of the attention when Disney+ launches, but don't write off this sitcom as just for kids.
'His Dark Materials' HBO (expected in November)
The world of Phillip Pullman's classic fantasy trilogy comes to life, in far more detail (and with better writing) than the failed 2007 film "The Golden Compass." With each planned season based on one of Pullman's novels, "Materials" (already renewed for a second) gives more depth to the story of Lyra (Dafne Keen), the bright young girl living in a world slightly different than our own (human souls live outside their bodies in animals called "daemons"). Co-starring Lin-Manuel Miranda, James McAvoy and Ruth Wilson, the steampunk-style fantasy world might satisfy HBO viewers.

Opinion: Try again, Bob. Baffert's response to Justify drug allegations isn't good enough

Texto completo: For two decades, Bob Baffert has worn the burden of being horse racing’s most recognizable figure with reliable ease.
When the reporters and cameras gather around his barn every morning during the Triple Crown, he’ll go out of his way to shower them with soundbites. When TMZ tracks him outside a Los Angeles restaurant and asks him to predict his next Derby winner, he’ll happily engage in the nonsense. He once was asked to be the celebrity guest picker on ESPN’s "College GameDay," which is quite a statement in and of itself for someone who trains Thoroughbreds for a living.
It’s also why so many within horse racing love him so much. In a sport where the trainers are often reluctant to court fame or publicity, Baffert — with that shock of white hair and the trademark sunglasses that make him instantly recognizable everywhere — has rarely encountered an opportunity to promote himself or the sport that he didn’t take.
Which makes Baffert’s response to Wednesday’s explosive New York Times story about his 2018 Triple Crown winner, Justify, all the more inadequate.
Thus far, Baffert has issued two statements about the report, which details how Justify tested positive after the Santa Anita Derby for above-threshold levels of a drug called scopolamine. It also shows how the California Horse Racing Board essentially threw out the result and worked to keep the positive test from becoming public, raising significant questions about conflicts of interest with board members and whether Baffert received preferential treatment.
The first statement on Thursday morning, issued by Baffert’s attorney and addressed to Times reporter Joe Drape, called the story “long on sensationalism, short on facts, and does a great disservice to Mr. Baffert, JUSTIFY, and the entire horse industry. ”
In a second statement attributed to Baffert himself, he denied giving scopolamine to the horse and attributed the positive test to “environmental contamination caused by the presence of Jimson Weed in feed, a naturally growing substance in areas where hay and straw are produced in California” while pointing out that Justify had clean drug tests after all three Triple Crown races.
Sorry, but that’s not good enough. And it's not going to be the end of the questions surrounding Baffert and how California regulators handled the test.
The horse racing establishment is already going to work, calling Drape agenda-driven, circling the wagons to protect the legacy of its biggest human star and trying to pass this off as a process controversy rather than a massive black mark on one of the sport’s all-time great achievements.
And because of what’s at stake here, Baffert needs to step up and answer some questions, not hide behind coordinated talking points 15 hours after the story broke. (According to Drape, Baffert declined multiple requests to discuss the issue before the story was published, which isn’t a great look either, given the seriousness of the allegations. )
Regardless of whether scopolamine enhances performance or not — that’s another excuse some horse racing folks are using today — and regardless of whether 300 nanongrams per milliliter could even be attained through contamination, it’s still a positive test above the threshold level allowed by California regulations. And if you’re going to attribute it to the jimson weed, aren’t there some obvious follow-ups here, like where did Baffert source Justify’s feed and hay? Did other horses in his barn test positive for scopolamine and at similar levels? If not, that would seem to be both relevant and damning.
According to the statement from Baffert’s attorney, W. Craig Robertson, however, after notification of the positive test, Robertson told California regulators he “would vigorously defend Mr. Baffert should the CHRB pursue an action to either disqualify JUSTIFY or suspend Mr. Baffert,” and that the board was left with a choice to “either pursue a frivolous case that had no merit at great taxpayer expense — or exercise reason and common sense and decide to take no further action. ”
Does that really sound like a trainer who was eager to get to the bottom of a positive test and vigorously defend himself, or someone who was trying to run out the clock via threat before the Kentucky Derby and hope it would go away?
And that question should matter to everyone involved, because if Justify had been disqualified from the Santa Anita Derby for the positive test, he wouldn’t have even qualified for the Kentucky Derby.
Because California regulators heeded Robertson's warning, we may never know what should have actually happened with Justify, and there may be no remedy available to change or even put an asterisk next to history. But as the face of the sport, Baffert’s response so far doesn't even come close to answering the questions that need to be asked.

Looking at the campaign through Sanford’s looking glass

Resumen: The disgraced former South Carolina governor and congressman announced Sunday that he’s running against Donald Trump for the 2020 Republican nomination. The narrative-shmarrative is that Sanford is an old-school Republican whose concerns are focused on a strong, bootstrap economy and, well, that’s about it so far. Sanford’s well-reasoned concerns about the unfathomable debt, his low-key, soft-spoken style and his cool Southern manner might have made him a terrific presidential candidate in another time, especially alongside his tough, accomplished wife and central-casting sons.

Texto completo: CHARLESTON, S.C. — Once upon a time, Mark Sanford might have been a contender, but there’s too much water under the bridges that stretch from this city of steeples to his erstwhile home on Sullivan’s Island.
The disgraced former South Carolina governor and congressman announced Sunday that he’s running against Donald Trump for the 2020 Republican nomination. The third challenger to toss his hat into the wishing well of magical thinking, Sanford says he plans to talk about the skyrocketing debt, tariffs, trade and tone. Perfect. That’ll ignite the crowds and knock the grand poobah of pomp and propaganda off his game.
You can just see it: The boyish Sanford — an itinerant stranger in his own strange land — going toe to toe with the swamp-menacing Trump. It would be worth the price of a ticket. Trump’s other two GOP opponents, former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld and former Illinois Rep. Joe Walsh, may as well grab one while they last.
Nevertheless, the buzz does what buzz does. In the days following Sanford’s announcement and a series of cable-TV appearances, you’d have thought the former governor were the deus ex machina of the GOP. Recent commentary from conservatives has been dripping with so much honey you don’t know whether to build a hive or kill the drones.
The narrative-shmarrative is that Sanford is an old-school Republican whose concerns are focused on a strong, bootstrap economy and, well, that’s about it so far. Also, BIG HEADLINE, he believes in climate change and legal immigration because, what life form other than Trump’s most fervent supporters doesn’t?
Further to Sanford’s coronation as GOP savior, according to Republican strategist Liz Mair writing Monday in The New York Times, he’s a bigger threat to Trump than his co-challengers because he was never a "Never Trumper." Unlike Walsh and Weld — a strong law firm name if things go awry, as surely they will — Sanford appears to be uninterested in making the race all about Trump, even though Trump’s anti-endorsement in 2018 led to Sanford’s congressional primary defeat.
Plus, wrote Mair, Sanford is more "nuanced." Perhaps she was thinking of the subtle differences between Argentina and the Appalachian Trail, where in 2009 the then-governor Sanford told everyone through a spokesperson that he’d be hiking for a few days but instead found himself in South America with his mistress?
Mair insists that the tryst that ended Sanford’s governorship, as well as his marriage, was "the least-scandalous scandal in modern political history" because, after all, he only had an "extramarital affair because he fell in love and got engaged to the woman."
This confection would be news to South Carolinians who were appalled by his deceit and repulsed by his weepy news conference to confess his sins. Such a cavalier dismissal of a family betrayal would also be news to ex-wife Jenny Sanford, who wrote a book, "Staying True" about it.
It is absolutely true that Sanford, 59, is a time-tested conservative on budgetary matters, as my Washington Post colleague Jennifer Rubin argued under the banner headline "Mark Sanford might be the Republicans’ last chance." No one can accuse him of being a fake conservative, she wrote.
Indeed, not. As governor, Sanford was such a budget cruncher that he brought two baby pigs, one under each arm, to the statehouse to make his point about — get it? — pork.
It is quite possible that most or many Americans don’t care what Sanford did in his personal life, but the nicknamed "Luv Guv’s" philandering meanderings were public matters by virtue of two facts: The highest-ranking official of the state lied about his whereabouts and was unreachable. He simply slipped the reins of government and followed his passion, which was concerned with "issues" having nothing to do with matters of state.
It’s not the economy, it’s character. Only someone as despicable as Donald Trump could make a man like Mark Sanford palatable. Sanford’s well-reasoned concerns about the unfathomable debt, his low-key, soft-spoken style and his cool Southern manner might have made him a terrific presidential candidate in another time, especially alongside his tough, accomplished wife and central-casting sons. But that time has passed.

Texto completo: CHARLESTON, S.C. — Once upon a time, Mark Sanford might have been a contender, but there’s too much water under the bridges that stretch from this city of steeples to his erstwhile home on Sullivan’s Island.
The disgraced former South Carolina governor and congressman announced Sunday that he’s running against Donald Trump for the 2020 Republican nomination. The third challenger to toss his hat into the wishing well of magical thinking, Sanford says he plans to talk about the skyrocketing debt, tariffs, trade and tone. Perfect. That’ll ignite the crowds and knock the grand poobah of pomp and propaganda off his game.
You can just see it: The boyish Sanford — an itinerant stranger in his own strange land — going toe to toe with the swamp-menacing Trump. It would be worth the price of a ticket. Trump’s other two GOP opponents, former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld and former Illinois Rep. Joe Walsh, may as well grab one while they last.
Nevertheless, the buzz does what buzz does. In the days following Sanford’s announcement and a series of cable-TV appearances, you’d have thought the former governor were the deus ex machina of the GOP. Recent commentary from conservatives has been dripping with so much honey you don’t know whether to build a hive or kill the drones.
The narrative-shmarrative is that Sanford is an old-school Republican whose concerns are focused on a strong, bootstrap economy and, well, that’s about it so far. Also, BIG HEADLINE, he believes in climate change and legal immigration because, what life form other than Trump’s most fervent supporters doesn’t?
Further to Sanford’s coronation as GOP savior, according to Republican strategist Liz Mair writing Monday in The New York Times, he’s a bigger threat to Trump than his co-challengers because he was never a "Never Trumper." Unlike Walsh and Weld — a strong law firm name if things go awry, as surely they will — Sanford appears to be uninterested in making the race all about Trump, even though Trump’s anti-endorsement in 2018 led to Sanford’s congressional primary defeat.
Plus, wrote Mair, Sanford is more "nuanced." Perhaps she was thinking of the subtle differences between Argentina and the Appalachian Trail, where in 2009 the then-governor Sanford told everyone through a spokesperson that he’d be hiking for a few days but instead found himself in South America with his mistress?
Mair insists that the tryst that ended Sanford’s governorship, as well as his marriage, was "the least-scandalous scandal in modern political history" because, after all, he only had an "extramarital affair because he fell in love and got engaged to the woman."
This confection would be news to South Carolinians who were appalled by his deceit and repulsed by his weepy news conference to confess his sins. Such a cavalier dismissal of a family betrayal would also be news to ex-wife Jenny Sanford, who wrote a book, "Staying True" about it.
It is absolutely true that Sanford, 59, is a time-tested conservative on budgetary matters, as my Washington Post colleague Jennifer Rubin argued under the banner headline "Mark Sanford might be the Republicans’ last chance." No one can accuse him of being a fake conservative, she wrote.
Indeed, not. As governor, Sanford was such a budget cruncher that he brought two baby pigs, one under each arm, to the statehouse to make his point about — get it? — pork.
It is quite possible that most or many Americans don’t care what Sanford did in his personal life, but the nicknamed "Luv Guv’s" philandering meanderings were public matters by virtue of two facts: The highest-ranking official of the state lied about his whereabouts and was unreachable. He simply slipped the reins of government and followed his passion, which was concerned with "issues" having nothing to do with matters of state.
It’s not the economy, it’s character. Only someone as despicable as Donald Trump could make a man like Mark Sanford palatable. Sanford’s well-reasoned concerns about the unfathomable debt, his low-key, soft-spoken style and his cool Southern manner might have made him a terrific presidential candidate in another time, especially alongside his tough, accomplished wife and central-casting sons. But that time has passed.

Texto completo: Justify won the 2018 Triple Crown after a failed postrace drug test at a California track that could have kept the horse out of the Kentucky Derby, The New York Times reported Wednesday.
The Bob Baffert-trained Justify tested positive for the drug scopolamine after winning the Santa Anita Derby, one of the final prep races for the Kentucky Derby. Justify went on to win the Kentucky Derby and took the Preakness and Belmont stakes to complete the Triple Crown.
The Times said instead of a speedy disqualification, the California Horse Racing Board took more than a month to confirm the results. The newspaper also reported that instead of filing a public complaint, the board made decisions behind closed doors as it moved to drop the case and lighten the penalty for horses found to have scopolamine in their systems.
The newspaper said test results, emails and internal memorandums show how California regulators waited nearly three weeks, until the Kentucky Derby was only nine days away, to notify Baffert of the positive test. Then, two months after the Belmont victory, the board disposed of the inquiry altogether during a closed-door executive session.
"We take seriously the integrity of horse racing in California and are committed to implementing the highest standards of safety and accountability for all horses, jockeys and participants," the California Horse Racing Board said in a statement.
The organization said it would have a further statement Thursday.
Basketball: The U.S. was ousted from medal contention by France at the World Cup, failing to capture gold at a major tournament for the first time since the 2006 world championships. Rudy Gobert had 21 points and 16 rebounds and France beat the U.S. 89-79 in the World Cup quarterfinals in Dongguan, China. The U.S. had won 58 consecutive tournament games in FIBA and Olympic competition. It was bidding to become the first nation to win three consecutive World Cups. The U.S. already had qualified for next summer's Olympics in Tokyo.
Golf: Rory McIlroy was voted PGA Tour player of the year over Brooks Koepka after posting the most top-10 finishes and winning the FedEx Cup. It's the third time McIlroy has won the Jack Nicklaus Award, and the first without having won a major.
NHL: The Bruins signed coach Bruce Cassidy, 54, to a multiyear contract extension. Terms of the deal weren't available.

Make gazpacho to use late-summer veggies

Texto completo: Today, I decided to try a recipe for "really the best gazpacho ever" shared a while ago by a reader.
My reason for trying it today was that I harvested a basket of ripe tomatoes with spots or cracks and had to do something with them, and quick.
So I cut bad parts off and plugged in my blender. I blended the tomatoes with red onion, cucumber, a Hungarian pepper from my garden, a bit of sherry vinegar, garlic, salt and a decent amount of olive oil. The recipe called for straining afterwards, but you know what? I had a big bowl of it straight from the blender, sans straining. Addictively good.
You could do either, leave as is or strain for an elegant presentation.
Now truth be told, I have a packed file of gazpacho recipes. This one, though, is my newest fave. A smooth Spanish style gazpacho, easy and so fast.
The bonus? It uses those late summer, less than perfect, dead ripe veggies.
Make this gazpacho! Let me know how you like it, OK?
Originally from Julia Moskin, New York Times. Here's my adaptation. As always, go to taste.
Ingredients
A good 2 pounds red or combo of ripe tomatoes, cored and chunked up — I used red, yellow, and grape
1 Cubanelle or sweet banana pepper or about half of a sweet bell, seeded and chunked. I used a sweet Hungarian banana pepper
1 cucumber, about 8" long, peeled and chunked
1/3 to 1/2 cup red or mild onion, chunked (careful, here, you can always add more but you can't take away...).
1 nice teaspoon garlic/1 large clove
1 tablespoon sherry vinegar
Salt — I used 11/2 teaspoons
1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil or to taste, plus extra to drizzle
Instructions
Put everything but vinegar, salt and oil in blender and blend on high until very smooth. With motor running, add vinegar and salt.
Slowly pour in oil and blend until everything is emulsified and again, smooth. It will be the thickness of salad dressing. If a bit watery, add a little more oil until it's creamy the way you like it.
Now you can either strain it all through strainer or food mill, making sure you press hard on solids, or leave as is, or just strain some of it.
For a silky smooth soup, you should strain it all.
Chill about 6 hours or overnight.
To serve:
Adjust seasonings. If too thick, add a bit of ice water.
Serve with drizzle of oil.
Serve as appetizer or first course in shot or small glasses or as an entre in a bowl.
Try my garlic crostini alongside.
Substitute for sherry vinegar
Try red wine vinegar with maybe a tad of sugar, since sherry vinegar has a sweeter flavor profile.
Serve alongside the gazpacho.
Rub a clove of garlic on thick baguette slices. Drizzle with olive oil.
Sprinkle with shredded Manchego, Parmesan, or leave plain.
Run under broiler.

Kamala Harris’ criminal justice reform plan can’t be trusted

Texto completo: “I know the system from the inside out, so trust me when I say we have a problem with mass incarceration in America. Trust me when I say we have a problem with accountability. Trust me when I say we have to take the profit out of criminal justice.” These are the words of presidential candidate Kamala Harris in an interview with the New York Times on her recently-unveiled criminal justice plan. She asks voters to put their faith in her because of her experience, but it’s her experience that shows voters exactly why they should think twice about that.
Harris’s new plan begins with an introduction that attempts once more to paint the self-portrait she’s persistently pushed throughout her campaign: one of a reform-minded prosecutor who “has seen firsthand the fundamental flaws of the system.” She’s seen them alright—and personally contributed to them. As Tulsi Gabbard aptly noted in the last debate, Harris was far from a reformer during her prosecutor days. In fact, she was notoriously tough on crime.
But she’s apparently had a pretty recent change of heart.
In her new plan, Harris proposes ending the war on drugs, claiming marijuana legalization is the first step toward that. It’s an excellent proposition and fairly mainstream among the Democratic candidates, but it’s certainly not something that Harris has always stood by.
Historically, she opposed the legalization of marijuana, and as a San Francisco District Attorney, she oversaw hundreds of marijuana convictions. Although she may not have been directly involved in the convictions, she had immense power to direct her attorneys which marijuana cases to prosecute, and what punishments to pursue. Yet, despite how sorry she is for all of the lives she’s had a part in ruining during her tenure as lead prosecutor, she’s done nothing to help those particular people.
Among her plans, too, we find a proposed effort to expunge marijuana-related criminal records and create a grant program from marijuana sales tax to help those most adversely affected by the drug war. Sure, these policies are noble, but they’re not a total ceasefire in the drug war by any means. After all, this is where Harris’s plan here falls flat. Aside from legalizing marijuana, she supports reducing the sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine. That’s a change that is certainly important, but, in terms of drug reform, it’s low-hanging fruit.
Proposing pre- arrest diversion programs, legalizing safe injection sites, descheduling drugs and loosening academic study restrictions are all strong policies that would help end the drug war. But she didn’t make any of those suggestions.
As a San Francisco District Attorney, Harris opposed the use of drug courts for those charged with drug related crimes—another action which is not cohesive with ending the drug war which she now supports. Drug courts are great, because they’re set up to provide an alternative sentencing route for individuals so they can be connected with the resources and treatment they need, rather than sticking them straight into prison.
But as Reason Magazine reports, Harris complained that people “learned how to manipulate the system by simply claiming to be addicts.” She proposed barring individuals from drug court if they had ever sold any quantity of drugs in the past—even if they needed addiction help. This means prison time for low-level drug offenders who, somehow, she’s had a wild change of mind about.
That same goes for her stance of the cash bail system. Money bail disproportionately harms low- income individuals, because they can’t afford to buy their way out of pretrial incarceration the way the wealthy can. They remain in jail—sometimes for months on end—until they can find a way to post bail or until their court date comes around.
Though Harris has sponsored legislation to end cash bail, this fight may dwindle when she becomes president. She previously supported hiking the rates of cash bail, but, of course, this is the exact opposite of what she’s saying now.
Sure, Harris’s criminal justice plan has a lot of good proposals. It even calls for accountability by granting the U.S. Department of Justice explicit authority to conduct investigations into prosecutorial offices that commit misconduct.
It’s a bold policy that stands among many other needed reforms outlined found in her plan. But none of this changes the fact that she spent so many years of her life locking people up for the things she’s claiming to be dovish on now. And that’s when she wasn’t trying to become president.
Harris has been caught lying for political gain before, so what’s stopping her from doing it again—especially if it could win her the Oval Office?
For the sake of those who spent years of their lives sitting in prisons because of her terrible policies, it’s a question worth seriously considering.

TONY EVERS IS RIGHT ABOUT GOP GUN RESPONSE: IT'S BS

Texto completo: Hats off to Gov. Tony Evers for calling out Wisconsin legislative Republicans' position on guns for what it is BS.
Evers made his blunt assessment after GOP leaders Robin Vos and Scott Fitzgerald, dutifully followed by their submissive colleagues in the Assembly and Senate, announced they had no intention of even considering Evers' proposals to address what has become a national crisis.
In the wake of the El Paso and Dayton mass shootings and calls from the public that government officials do something, Evers proposed that Wisconsin enact a universal background check procedure and pass a red-flag law that would establish a process for a judge to remove guns from a person determined to be a threat to themselves or others.
Sound sensible? No, not to this group of NRA-backed legislators who, like their ilk in all too many other states and in Congress, can't bring themselves to do or, at least, try one thing to address the violence in our gun-cultured nation.
Vos and Fitzgerald trotted out the old NRA talking points that passing such laws will lead to the repeal of Americans' Second Amendment rights and the confiscation of all firearms, including hunting guns and rifles. They know full well that, as Tony Evers says, is nothing but BS.
One of the Vos-Fitzgerald puppets, Rep. Joe Sanfelippo of the Milwaukee suburb of New Berlin, introduced a new twist in an op-ed he distributed to state newspapers last week. He accused Democrats of "exploiting" the tragedies for political gain while hypocritically ignoring crimes in the inner city.
Like so many of his head-in-the-sand colleagues, he implied that tighter gun controls will fix nothing, an assertion that flies in the face of the successes of states and localities that have gone off on their own to strengthen background checks and limiting assault weapons.
Just how long are politicians like Sanfelippo going to get by with brushing off every mass shooting by claiming gun laws won't fix anything and accusing those who want something anything to be done, including 80% of Americans, of grandstanding? Again, why do the world's other democracies not experience what we do?
Despite their penchant to once again ignore everything, preferring to defend the status quo that has made America an outlier among civilized nations, Evers is determined not to let them get off so easy.
If the GOP leaders won't at least consider his proposals to expand background checks and enact "red-flag" legislation, he has promised to call the Assembly and Senate into special session and force them to look at the bills. And, if they decide to merely open the session and then adjourn without even debating gun laws, Evers believes they'll need to answer to the voters at their next election.
It's easy to envision Vos, Fitzgerald and the other defenders of the failed gun culture status quo shrugging off such foolishness as suggesting they might be in trouble with the voters. But when you can all but guarantee your reelection through clever gerrymandering, that's a tougher chore than it ought to be. Yet, it's becoming clear that many Americans are getting fed up with the inaction by our political leaders and the escalating number of innocent deaths.
What many of these pro-gun-at-anycost politicians don't seem to know is that our gun mania isn't just causing the U.S. problems.
Late last month, the New York Times ran a lengthy piece describing how guns from the U.S. are being smuggled into Central and South American countries and are ending up in the hands of gangs and outlaws. Every month, more than 200 illegal guns are smuggled into the small island country of Jamaica alone. It's estimated that more than 200,000 illegal firearms flow from the U.S. into Mexico each year.
While Jamaica, for example, has a strict gun law of its own there are only 45,000 legal guns among its 3 million people gun-connected crime has risen dramatically. It's estimated that up to 80% of the homicides in Jamaica have been perpetrated with guns smuggled into the country from the United States.
"Many people in the U.S. see gun control as a purely domestic issue," said Anthony Clayton, the author of Jamaica's national security policy. But, Americas's "long suffering neighbors, whose citizens are being murdered by U.S. weapons, have a very different perspective."
To top it off, U.S. gun regulations are so weak that it's next to impossible to track exactly where the guns originated. As the story pointed out, only a few American states mandate registration of firearms. In fact, several states explicitly prohibit it. There is no comprehensive registry of gun ownership and the federal government is forbidden to create one.
This is the gun culture Congress ignores and Wisconsin legislative Republicans defend while belittling any attempt to at least try something.

Texto completo: In 1879, on the road leading into Dodge City, there stood a sign. "The Carrying of Fire Arms Strictly Prohibited," it said.
As recounted in the book "Gunfight: The Battle Over the Right to Bear Arms in America," by Adam Winkler, the gun control ordinance was the first law passed when the city was organized in 1873. Nor was Dodge City unique. Many other Western towns, Wichita and Tombstone among them, had similar laws.
The statutes don't seem to have been particularly controversial. Though Dodge City was, by reputation if not always in actual fact, one of the toughest and most lawless places on the frontier, cowboys had no problem walking unarmed into its brothels and saloons. Yet in 2019, many of us feel the need to take guns into Walmart.
Worse, they're allowed to do so under permissive "open carry" laws, which, in most states, give people the right to bear handguns and even long guns in public. But now Walmart is fighting back. Sort of.
Last week, the giant retailer announced that it was "respectfully requesting" that people not bring guns into its stores. This, on the heels of last month's racist mass shooting - 22 people died - at a Walmart in El Paso. Other companies, including Kroger, CVS and Walgreens, quickly followed suit. The New York Times notes that still more companies - Starbucks, Target and Chipotle among them - already had such policies in place. Most used the same word Walmart did to couch their requests: "respectfully."
To say "it's about time" is to understate. Years of living in the shadow of massacres has left us a nation on tenterhooks, 330 million people all sharing the same case of post-traumatic stress disorder. One recalls the panicked stampede in Times Square last month when motorcycles backfired. One observes that children are being sent back to school this year with bulletproof backpacks. And one is glad businesses are willing to "respectfully request."
But they must do more.
The idea of a cowboy walking without his revolver down the wooden sidewalks of Tombstone stands in rather pointed contrast to that of some accountant waiting in line at a suburban Starbucks with an AR-15 slung across his back. One can imagine no more vivid illustration of the absurdist dystopia this country has become as a result of the National Rifle Association, its Republican toadies and their conviction that all people must have access to all guns in all places at all times.
If you're sitting in a movie theater or standing in a checkout line and some stranger walks by carrying a military-grade rifle, do you feel safer or do you start looking for the exit? The answer is obvious: This is not a scenario that instills a sense of security. One would have to be drunk, stupid or Republican to think otherwise.
So it's good to see American business taking a stand American lawmakers won't, the marketplace of commerce reaching a consensus the marketplace of ideas can't. That said, this polite pleading is not enough. Asked about Walmart's policy, even David Amad, a gun rights activist in Texas, told the Times, "They are ducking the issue."
Which they are. Walmart and other retailers seek a path of least resistance that will relieve them of the responsibility of taking a stand. But no such path exists: Sides must be chosen and lines must be drawn, because this is, quite literally, a matter of life and death. And death and death and death. As a private entity, Walmart, like CVS, Starbucks and Kroger, can simply say, "Do not bring guns into our stores." They have that power, and they must use it. The majority of us who want gun sanity in this land must require them to. They've made their "respectful request."
We must answer with an impatient demand.

Texto completo: While I find the evidence of obstruction more than sufficient to impeach President Trump, I'm beginning to think it's the least important, most problematic aspect of this presidency for the House Judiciary Committee, which is poised to present guidelines for impeachment.
Obstruction of justice is no trivial matter. However, from a political perspective it is complicated, already chewed over and hard to investigate, as we've seen from Trump's efforts to block committee investigations.
The House should seriously consider shifting the focus from the Mueller report and Trump's attempts to short-circuit the Russia investigation to the overarching issue of this presidency: his unparalleled corruption. The Mueller report will come into play, but as an example of a particular form of corruption. This undermines the entire premise of Trump's outsider campaign by focusing on how he uses the presidency to enrich himself and serve his personal needs.
The enrichment schemes multiply and become more nauseating by the day: The attorney general's planned $30,000 party at Trump's hotel in Washington (the lease for which should have been voided), the vice president's family trip to Trump's Irish resort, the largesse from foreign leaders and domestic politicians staying at Trump properties, the alleged diversion of Air Force flights to benefit Trump's Scottish property and the invitation to hold the next Group of Seven meeting at his Doral property. The legal definition of "emoluments" hardly matters; this is out and out corruption, much of it out in the open, and all stemming from the original sins of refusing to release his taxes and to divest from his properties.
These incidents amount to a betrayal of his oath, which obligates him to act in the interests of the American people, not his own bottom line. One need not prove a crime here, although the racket does smack of pay-to-play bribery.
The corruption at issue also entails the misuse of government agencies and employees to lie and protect him politically. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has contributed two items: misrepresenting the purpose of the citizenship census question to Congress and the courts and, as The New York Times reports, threatening "to fire top employees at the federal scientific agency responsible for weather forecasts last Friday after the agency's Birmingham office contradicted President Trump's claim that Hurricane Dorian might hit Alabama, according to three people familiar with the discussion."
In this category, we have everything from enlistment of the Park Service to cover his lie about the inauguration crowd size to imploring others to lie about his hush-money payment to an adult film star, his demands to fire the special prosecutor and the reasons for firing then-FBI Director James Comey (here's where the Mueller report comes into play). The lies are bad enough, but corrupting the instruments of government to lie and mislead the American people rises to a new level of abuse of power.
The reasons for proceeding in this fashion are three-fold.
First, the recent revelations are easy to explain and inexcusable. This will require public support, and framing the issues in this way certainly helps the public grasp what is so terribly wrong with Trump's conduct.
Second, no Republican can defend the grifting. To date they've ignored it or said inanely that voters knew about all this when they elected him. However, forcing Senate Republicans to exonerate him of self-dealing may push them to the outer limits of their patience and instinct for self-preservation.
Third, this issue plays wells on a bipartisan basis and does not force Republicans to admit they elected a Russian toady or a racist; Trump betrayed them by in effect stealing from them.
And finally, this goes to the heart of Trump's phony populism, the lie on which his presidency is built upon. He is not the voice of the people, nor are critics enemies of the people; he's a greedy operator who has taken his talents in bilking people out of their money (e.g., Trump University) to the White House. Discrediting the notion that Trump or the Republicans who defend him have the interests of the people in mind (also evident in policies such as a tax cut for the rich, tariffs that hurt farmers, taking away health care, etc.) is critical to not only beating Trump but also discrediting Trumpism.

Texto completo: HUNTSVILLE, Ala. -- Neil Jacobs, head of the federal scientific agency threatened with firings after one of its offices contradicted President Trump on Hurricane Dorian, defended the administration Tuesday even as he issued a carefully worded defense of agency scientists.
The remarks were the latest example of a Trump administration official facing enormous political pressure in an atmosphere that prioritizes loyalty above all else.
"This administration is committed to the important mission of weather forecasting," Dr. Jacobs, acting administrator for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said in remarks at a weather conference here. "There is no pressure to change the way you communicate or forecast risk in the future."
Dr. Jacobs's speech attracted outsized attention because of President Trump's insistence that Alabama was in Dorian's path and a subsequent New York Times report that Commerce Secretary Wilbur L. Ross Jr. had threatened to fire NOAA's political staff unless the agency stood by the president.
"He's between a very big rock and a very hard place," said Rear Admiral David W. Titley, a former oceanographer for the Navy who served as the chief operating officer of NOAA under President Barack Obama. "I would argue he needs to go home and look in the mirror and decide: Can he serve a boss who has no respect for the federal work force and the National Weather Service."
On Sept. 1, Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter that Dorian would hit Alabama "harder than anticipated." A few minutes later, the National Weather Service office in Birmingham, Ala., which is part of NOAA, posted on Twitter that "Alabama will NOT see any impacts from Dorian. We repeat, no impacts from Hurricane Dorian will be felt across Alabama."
Mr. Trump pushed back, repeatedly insisting that his warning about Alabama had been accurate. (Alabama was not struck by the hurricane.)
Then, early last Friday, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross Jr., whose department has responsibility over NOAA, phoned Dr. Jacobs, telling him that the political staff at NOAA would be fired if the situation was not fixed, according to three people familiar with the conversation. Later that day, NOAA issued an unusual, unsigned statement that rebuked the Birmingham office, calling its statement "inconsistent with probabilities from the best forecast products available at the time."
That NOAA statement led to an uproar among scientists, who charged that the administration was politicizing the weather service. The Commerce Department's Office of Inspector General is now examining the circumstances surrounding the statement, according to documents reviewed by The New York Times.
Tuesday's speech by Dr. Jacobs, which had been scheduled before the hurricane, represented his first comments on the statement and the controversy. It almost didn't happen.
According to three people familiar with the discussion, Dr. Jacobs met Monday afternoon with several Commerce Department officials, several of whom put pressure on him to cancel his speech. Dr. Jacobs, however, was adamant about appearing, the three people said.
He began by praising Mr. Trump, calling him "genuinely interested in improving weather forecasts." Dr. Jacobs also echoed the president's position that Dorian initially threatened Alabama. "At one point, Alabama was in the mix, as was the rest of the Southeast."
Without retracting the statement his office issued on Friday, Dr. Jacobs also said he still had faith in the Birmingham office.
"The purpose of the NOAA statement was to clarify the technical aspects of the potential impacts of Dorian," Dr. Jacobs said. "What it did not say, however, is that we understand and fully support the good intent of the Birmingham weather forecast office, which was to calm fears in support of public safety."
"I am proud of the outstanding work performed by all the weather forecasting offices, including Birmingham, during the span of this storm," Dr. Jacobs continued. "No one's job is under threat -- not mine, not yours. The weather service team has my full support and the support of the department."
In the ballroom where meteorologists had gathered for their conference, the unsigned NOAA statement was all anyone seemed to be talking about. After Dr. Jacobs's remarks, many of the forecasters mingling in the hallways outside settled on a common descriptor: diplomatic.
"He did the best he could in the situation," said Christina Crowe, a forecaster with the National Weather Service.
Ms. Crowe noted that the speech was more muted than that of Louis W. Uccellini, the National Weather Service director, who received a standing ovation for his defense of the Birmingham office the day before. "It was a different tone than yesterday, but a lot of us understand why," she said.
Elise Schultz, a research scientist in Huntsville who attended the conference, said Dr. Jacobs's presence at the annual meeting had showed courage.
"He's in a tough position," she said. "He cares and wants to move forward. I wouldn't want to be in his shoes."
Many forecasters declined to speak on the record for fear of losing their jobs or of ratcheting up the political furor surrounding what many have always viewed as a nonpolitical government job.
The episode shined an uncomfortable spotlight on a quiet department best known for weather forecasting and monitoring oceans. A sub-agency under the Commerce Department with a budget that hovers around $ 5 billion, NOAA does little in the way of regulation or policy, and has for the most part avoided controversy under the Trump administration.
Richard Hirn, general counsel for the National Weather Service Employees Organization, said the Dorian episode had crippled morale among employees. He said that in the past few years the National Weather Service had suffered so much from understaffing that employees had hit the federal statutory cap on overtime pay to fill shifts and now felt even less secure in their jobs.
"I'm afraid these people are just going to hang up their hat and leave," Mr. Hirn said. "And if substantial numbers wind up retiring, the National Weather Service won't be able to keep open the 122 forecast offices open 24-7, and there won't be anyone to watch the radar or issue severe weather warnings."
NOAA also has been without a Senate-confirmed administrator since the start of the Trump administration, the longest period without one since the agency was created in 1970.
Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs reported from Huntsville, Ala., and Christopher Flavelle and Lisa Friedman from Washington.

Texto completo: You need thick skin
if you troll John Legend's 'filthy mouthed wife'
On Sunday night, Chrissy Teigen was preparing for her daughter's first day of school with a tradition familiar to parents across the country: listing 3-year-old Luna's favorite things in bright, multicolored letters on a framed chalkboard sign.
But as the model, cookbook author and TV personality would later tell her 11 million Twitter followers, the night had taken a weird turn. President Trump saw Teigen's husband, singer John Legend, on an MSNBC town hall about criminal justice reform and fired off angry tweets, lamenting that the special had not mentioned the expansive bipartisan criminal justice bill he signed in December.
One of Trump's targets was Legend - one of the president's most vocal celebrity critics - whom he called "boring." But Trump didn't stop there - he also referenced the EGOT winner's "filthy mouthed wife."
The model has made no secret of her disdain for Trump, who famously blocked her on the social media platform during his first year in office. But his mention of her in a tweet about criminal justice reform was baffling. "The absolute best part of his tweet is I literally didn't speak in the special, nor was I mentioned," Teigen mused. In another, pointedly filthy mouthed tweet, she characterized the president using three expletives (at least two of which the president has also used) that became a widely shared hashtag.
The exchange captured the type of vitriol that Teigen (and other less famous women) often faces on social media. Trump's critics were quick to note that he has a pattern of attacking women of color in particular; he was widely criticized in July for telling four Democratic congresswomen of color to "go back" to "the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came."
Teigen, who first cultivated a vibrant social media presence with pithy posts about food, has weathered a barrage of social media criticism - about her parenting, her marriage, her career and, as noted in a 2014 New York Times profile, her weight. Trump's tweet certainly wasn't the first time that she had been reduced to her relationship with her husband, who notably referenced the president's spouse, first lady Melania Trump, in his own response. After years of unsolicited commentary from strangers on social media, she has perfected a knack for witty, discussion-ending retorts that often leave deleted tweets in their wake.
When a Twitter user posted a "respectful" inquiry as to whether Teigen was "pregnant again," she responded: "I just had a baby but thank you for being soooo respectful."
After she was criticized for sharing a photo of her breast-feeding her son (and pretending to feed a doll, at her daughter's request), Teigen wrote: "I don't care to see grainy fireworks, coachella selfies or infinity pool pics but i let people live."
When Legend posted a photo of Teigen bottle-feeding their son, Miles, one Instagram user pressed: "You no longer breastfeed?" The model could have pointed out that many breast-feeding moms feed their children pumped breast milk (or that it was simply none of the commenter's business), but she went with: "John never breastfed Miles."
She once politely thanked a critic for offering notes on a recent magazine cover, adding "if you could please send me specific tips and tricks (or past covers you've shot for reference!) that would be so awesome."
There are many more examples, often captured by the commentsbychrissyteigen Instagram and chronicled at least annually by BuzzFeed. Occasionally, Teigen's retorts lead the offending social media users to apologize. When she lobbed an expletive at a Twitter user who asserted she had "no discernible talent," the user admitted he sometimes "forget[s] there are real people with real feelings on the other side of the screen."
"I see this and appreciate what you've said," Teigen wrote back. She has admitted that, despite appearances, the criticism often gets to her. "Much stronger people are like 'I don't care what you think,' " she told Vogue last year. "I genuinely do care."
Still, Teigen's feisty comebacks have earned her a perpetually growing fan base, which on Monday included just about every late-night host. Trevor Noah gleefully repeated the model's rare triple-expletive for Trump, noting that the profanity had presented a challenge for cable news stations. "She just beat Trump at Twitter and nicknames," Stephen Colbert quipped. Jimmy Kimmel told viewers that Teigen's retort got "almost 10 times as many likes" as Trump's tweet. "Which, I think, means she's our new president, right?" he joked.
Even Meghan McCain, who regularly spars with her liberal co-hosts on "The View," declared her support for #teamchrissy on Twitter. ("Since when is there something wrong with being a filthy mouthed wife?")
The model, unlike the notoriously criticism-averse president, also has a penchant for making fun of herself. In July, she accidentally tweeted the full first episode of "Bring the Funny," the NBC comedy competition she began co-hosting over the summer, instead of an intended clip. "Well it looks like I have been fired for posting the whole thing thank u all for your kind texts and DMs please send job opportunities to same number," she joked.
On Monday, after her presidential riposte went viral, Teigen went back to her social media roots, sharing a video of her eating takeout pasta. She later reported that some of it had ended up on her couch. "Karma," she concluded, was also that string of three curse words she applied to the president.

Texto completo: A man who is part of the extreme-right National Democratic Party, which fosters neo-Nazism, has been appointed to serve as a district mayor in Germany.
Stefan Jagsch, 33, was placed in the role after officials in Waldsiedlung, a village near Frankfurt, said nobody else had applied. The position had remained unfilled for 10 weeks and nobody other than Jagsch said they wanted to do the job, according to the New York Times.
“We don’t have anyone else — especially not younger people who are good with computers and who can send emails,” said Norbert Szilasko, a local council member.
There has been swift condemnation after the appointment from a number of politicians. None of the seven officials who appointed Jagsch are associated with the National Democratic Party or the far-right, and according to Szilasko, no one considered Jagsch’s political affiliations when appointing him.
“What he does in the party or privately is no concern of mine, it is no concern of ours,” he said.
Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, leader of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union, said the party would be investigating the appointment considering some members of the party appointed Jagsch.
Lars Klingbeil, head of the Social Democrats, called for Jagsch’s appointment to be reversed, adding, “We do not cooperate with Nazis! Never!”
Jagsch said that the reaction has been harsh, calling it “totally exaggerated and ridiculous.”
Germany has unsuccessfully tried to ban the National Democratic Party a number of times. During the 2017 Parliamentary elections, the group brought in 0.4% of the vote.
Photo Caption:The resolution declined by the House State Government Subcommittee would have asked law enforcement agencies to regard white nationalist and neo-Nazi groups as “domestic terrorist organizations.”

Maps shouldn't be made to lie

Texto completo: I'm still stuck on Sharpie-gate. Sorry. But, so is Donald Trump.
On Sunday, Sept. 1, as Hurricane Dorian approached, Trump tweeted:
"In addition to Florida - South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama, will most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated."
He repeated the erroneous assertion during a FEMA briefing that day, saying: "And, I will say, the states - and it may get a little piece of a great place: It's called Alabama. And Alabama could even be in for at least some very strong winds and something more than that, it could be."
The problem: Alabama as a target had been eliminated days earlier as scientists refined their models and projections with more up-to-date information.
The president had either made an honest mistake (that happens) or he hadn't kept track of more current briefings (that shouldn't happen) or both. But, whatever the case, it was easy to fix by simply admitting the error.
Admitting error isn't the Trumpian way. In Trump's world view, admitting fault, no matter how small, exposes a frailty. In all things, one must deny, deny, deny, and do so strongly.
But correcting the error was not beyond the National Weather Service's Birmingham, Ala., office, indeed it was their duty. They tweeted that day: "Alabama will NOT see any impacts from #Dorian. We repeat, no impacts from Hurricane #Dorian will be felt across Alabama. The system will remain too far east. #alwx"
This was prudent. People make very real decisions about how to keep families safe, whether to keep businesses open and whether to keep government agencies running, based on storm predictions. Trump's error, in the abstract, could have been small, but failure to correct it could have had far-reaching implications, costly ones and possibly even deadly ones.
This set up a familiar fight for Trump: Him, his ego and his fallacies on one side, and truth, science and proper processes on the other.
Trump doesn't see the truth as rigid, absolute and unassailable. For Trump, truth is like Play-Doh: You can shape it however you want, squash it or ignore it altogether. It is a thing to be toyed with.
So, he sought to reshape it, turning what may well have been an honest mistake into an absolute lie. He sought to make his Alabama hurricane predictions real.
In a bit of farcical head-scratchery, he presented a map in the Oval Office, on which the track of the hurricane had been altered to include Alabama. It appeared that the additional line had been drawn on the map with a Sharpie.
In another stunning development, not only did the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration contradict the Birmingham office and support Trump's erroneous claim, on Saturday The Washington Post reported that "a top NOAA official warned its staff against contradicting the president."
The mutilated map, for me, was just too much. I had a deep, visceral reaction to the map, one born of a career worth of experience. Before I was a writer, I was in charge of the graphics department at The New York Times, and I was the art director of National Geographic magazine.
Both roles put me in charge of each institution's cartography divisions, the one at the Times being one of the most important mapping units in all of journalism, and the one at National Geographic being one of the most important in the world.
Not being a trained cartographer myself, I learned quite a bit from those who were. Perhaps most importantly was how seriously they took their craft. There was a near-religious devotion to its accuracy and precision.
Because of this unyielding commitment to accuracy, I believe cartography enjoys an enviable position of credibility and confidence among the people who see it. If you see it mapped, you believe.
That is precisely what you want the case to be, particularly in natural disasters. This cartography should be devoid of any attempt to deceive. Its only agenda should be to inform and enlighten.
That's what made Trump's marked-on map such a blasphemy: It attacked, on a fundamental level, truth, science and public trust. It wasn't just a defacement of a public document, it was a defilement of a sacred trust.
Also, if you're going to alter the map, is it too much to ask you to show some effort? But, I guess slapdash and tacky is the brand. I rescind the question.
The next time river waters rise, or wildfires rage, or hurricanes menace, will there be a kernel of doubt in some people's heads, a seed sown by the president himself?
This is what becomes of a society governed by a man who has no regard for truth: The truth doesn't survive without injury. And what price society will pay for conservatives watching in snide amusement as common truth is decimated is yet to be known.
They are too busy reveling in the fact that liberals find Trump's behavior maddening, a fact that they find titillating.
This should be partisan. Maps shouldn't be made to lie, not even for a president.

Israel's Leader Says Iran Hid a Nuclear Weapons Site

Texto completo: JERUSALEM -- Israel accused Iran on Monday of having harbored an undisclosed nuclear-weapons site that the Iranians destroyed a few months ago for fear of exposure. Iran ridiculed the accusation.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel displayed satellite photographs that he said showed the site, and he called upon other countries to join the United States in maintaining pressure on Tehran.
Mr. Netanyahu told reporters in Jerusalem that Israel had first learned of the site, in the central Iranian city of Abadeh, in early 2018 when Israeli spies stole what he has previously described as a huge trove of the archives of Iran's nuclear program.
When the Iranians learned that Israel was aware of the site, he said, "they simply destroyed it, just eliminated everything."
Mr. Netanyahu showed the photographs a week before an election in which he is battling for political survival. His move also came after President Trump suggested he might meet with President Hassan Rouhani of Iran, possibly during the United Nations General Assembly next month.
The Israeli prime minister described the satellite photos as having been taken in late June, and then about a month later, which appeared to show damage to buildings in a complex along a mountain ridge.
"Every time they hide, we reveal, and then they try to cover their tracks," Mr. Netanyahu said.
He took no questions during the presentation. But his assertions left many questions unanswered, chief among them why Israel waited until now to reveal information from a trove of material seized at a warehouse in Tehran, in an espionage operation, 21 months ago.
Mr. Netanyahu first revealed some material from the trove last year. In the summer of 2018, he invited reporters from The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post to review some of the material under the watchful eye of Israeli intelligence officers.
During those briefings, the officers were explicitly asked whether the documents pointed to additional undeclared nuclear facilities in Iran, but there was no mention of Abadeh.
So it is unclear when Israel concluded that the facility was linked to the nuclear program, or why it did not raise the public alarm earlier, before it was dismantled.
While some information was given by Israel to inspectors at the International Atomic Energy Agency, it is not clear that Abadeh was included. Nor is it clear why Mr. Netanyahu did not reveal the facility's existence as soon as the satellite imagery he cited had detected the Iranians dismantling it earlier this summer.
There was no immediate comment from the energy agency, the Vienna-based nuclear monitor of the United Nations, which polices Iran's compliance with the Nonproliferation Treaty and the 2015 nuclear agreement that Mr. Trump has abandoned.
But hours before Mr. Netanyahu spoke, the agency's acting director general, Cornel Feruta, said that in a just-completed visit to Iran, he had "stressed the need for Iran to respond promptly to agency questions related to the completeness of Iran's safeguards declarations."
Mr. Feruta declined to specify what the agency's inspectors wanted to know from the Iranians.
The agency has said for years that Iran halted organized efforts at exploring possible nuclear weapons in 2003. American intelligence officials have made the same conclusion.
The Israelis have accused the agency inspectors of inadequate supervision of Iran. According to Yossi Cohen, the chief of the Mossad, Israel's spy agency, a major purpose of stealing the nuclear archive was to give the agency information on where to look in Iran.
"Make no mistakes: The target of the operation in Tehran was not only to obtain intelligence, or to make an impression on the world's consciousness," he said in speech last June.
The timing of Mr. Netanyahu's news conference, with no opportunity for reporters to ask questions, led his political opponents to charge that he was exploiting national intelligence information for personal advantage.
"Netanyahu's use of sensitive security-related intelligence for the purposes of his propaganda speaks volumes of his impaired judgment," Benny Gantz, the former Israeli army chief of staff who leads the Blue and White Party and is tied with Mr. Netanyahu in the polls, told Israeli public radio.
Mr. Gantz and other Netanyahu critics, including former Prime Minister Ehud Barak, have repeatedly accused Mr. Netanyahu in recent weeks of improperly releasing secret information, often by disregarding Israel's longstanding policy of ambiguity to claim credit for airstrikes on Iranian forces and their allies in Syria and Iraq.
Iran has repeatedly denied Mr. Netanyahu's claims about its nuclear ambitions and has criticized Israel for amassing an arsenal of nuclear weapons, which according to the Arms Control Association, a Washington research group, totals between 80 and 90 warheads. Israel does not comment about its nuclear weapons.
Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif of Iran, in a Twitter post, responded sarcastically to Mr. Netanyahu's latest accusation: "The possessor of REAL nukes cries wolf -- on an ALLEGED "demolished" site in Iran," Mr. Zarif said.
Mr. Netanyahu has staked his career on his crusade against Iran and what he has described as its malevolent nuclear ambitions.
His success in helping to persuade Mr. Trump to abandon the Obama administration's nuclear deal with Iran, which eased sanctions in return for Iran's verifiable promises of peaceful nuclear work, was one of Mr. Netanyahu's crowning foreign-policy achievements.
But the Trump administration's current overture to Mr. Rouhani, and an offer to Iran by President Emmanuel Macron of France of $ 15 billion in aid, have undercut Mr. Netanyahu's unremitting posture toward Tehran.
At his news conference Monday, Mr. Netanyahu warned that Iran was "systematically lying" and urged other countries to embrace Mr. Trump's policy of stiff sanctions.
His message could have been aimed as much at Washington or Paris as at any other world capital: "The only way to stop Iran's march to the bomb, and its aggression in the region, is pressure, pressure and more pressure," he said.
One Israeli analyst who closely tracks the country's stance toward Iran said Mr. Netanyahu was unlikely to change any minds with Monday's announcement.
"The timing seems primarily related to imminent Israeli elections," said the analyst, Ofer Zalzberg of the International Crisis Group.
"President Trump already believes Iran hid certain activities and nevertheless seems to lean towards engaging with President Rouhani," he said. "Proof of another activity which Iran supposedly hid won't make much of a difference for him."
Israeli public radio quoted an unidentified aide to Mr. Netanyahu as having insisted that national-security "professionals," not political appointees, had advised the prime minister to unveil the Abadeh site on Monday, following Mr. Feruta's statement in Vienna.
Mr. Netanyahu also asserted Monday that the nuclear agency had found traces of uranium at a site Israel had uncovered in Turquzabad, where he said Iran had stored material and equipment for its nuclear program.
"This is what I have to say to the tyrants of Tehran: Israel knows what you're doing, Israel knows when you're doing it and Israel knows where you're doing it," Mr. Netanyahu said. "We will continue to expose your lies."
The Abadeh complex is clearly visible on Google Earth. The most recent Google Earth image was taken in January, months before the destruction asserted by Mr. Netanyahu, and shows a dozen or so buildings that appear to have been little used, with no obvious checkpoints or fences typically associated with Iran's military sites and large nuclear facilities.

Texto completo: Along with thought-provoking discussions about everything from politics to self-improvement to the Iditarod sled race, this year's Cap Times Idea Fest will feature trivia, a movie, interactive art and a comedy show this weekend in Madison.
"We're giving lots of things a try to make and appeal to as greats number of people as we can," said Capital Times managing editor Chris Murphy.
Now in its third year, the two-day event hosted by the Capital Times will include more than 90 speakers and moderators in nearly 40 panel discussions, one-on-one interviews and other sessions on UW-Madison's campus.
The main event starts Friday evening at Memorial Union and nearby buildings, but a movie screening and discussion will get the Idea Fest rolling Wednesday night.
A number of big-name political figures are in the lineup of speakers this year, including Democratic presidential candidate Julian Castro and his twin brother, U.S. Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas; former Democratic U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder; U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Oshkosh; Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez; and former U.S. Rep. Scott Klug, R-Madison.
Other well-known panelists and speakers include New York Times best-selling fiction author Chloe Benjamin, columnist and podcast host Ana Marie Cox, Epic CEO Judy Faulkner, Washington Post associate editor David Maraniss and other reporters from both The New York Times and The Washington Post.
Though Murphy was excited to have many high-profile speakers this year, he encouraged attendees to go to a variety of sessions, including those featuring speakers that may be unfamiliar.
"Even if you went to see people whose names you might not already know, I think you'd enjoy what they've got to say," Murphy said.
Murphy said he normally gravitates toward political conversations, but he is hoping to see the interview with nonfiction author Blair Braverman, an Iditarod sled racer from northern Wisconsin whose book chronicles the challenges she faced while being a dogsledder and tour guide in Norway and Alaska.
New this year is a movie chat after a screening of "All the President's Men" to kick off the event Wednesday at Marcus Point Cinema. Also new is the improvisational comedy piece by Monkey Business and the interactive art installation called "Changemaker" by Mallory Shotwell of the Arts + Literature Laboratory.
Murphy said part of the goal this year is to have a "broader mix of activities" to attract a variety of people.
For the more typical discussions, topics include marijuana legalization, criminal justice reform, the latest research on Alzheimer's disease, how to address the new media's "credibility crisis," diversifying theater companies, local food and dining, social media's impact on youth, nuclear weapons and more.
Additional notable speakers include former Wisconsin Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch, Madison Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway, political scientist Katherine Cramer and former Wisconsin Appeals Court Judge Paul Higginbotham, the first African American judge to serve on that court.
This year's theme, which all speakers will be working to advance, is how to "Reach a Better State."
Murphy said he sees the Idea Fest as another way for a newspaper to carry out its mission of informing the public. He hopes attendees will come away with thoughts of ways to fix problems in Wisconsin.
"The newspaper as a whole is a forum for ideas and discussion," Murphy said. "This is just another way of carrying that out."

Texto completo: Catharine Meredith Kurth, 56, died Saturday, August 31, 2019 at home in West Hartford, CT. She was predeceased by her father, Donald Meredith Kurth, and mother, Elinor Schenk Kurth. Kate was both July 23, 1963 in Summit, NJ. Kate attended Hall High School, Hartford College for Women, and Marlboro College, studying Irish History and Literature. After college Kate moved to San Francisco, CA, and worked for Phoebus, a theatrical lighting design company. She later returned to CT to be closer to family and for several years was a partner at Athena Trading Company, a home textiles design and manufacturing firm. Kate had an eye for beauty in all things. She brought her artistic talent to many endeavors--in decorating a room, preparing a meal, choosing a fabric, or taking a photograph. She was a true Anglophile, as well as a lover of literature, art, and design. She lived for travel, and had many adventures over the years both home and abroad, with some of her favorite memories from Coastal Maine. Kate had a wicked sense of humor and the sharpest of minds. She loved to match wits, to challenge with trivia, complete The New York Times Sunday crossword (in ink), and rarely did she lose a board or card game. Kate had a deeply generous spirit and delighted in finding (and wrapping) the perfect gift. As a child, Kate had many happy times with her paternal grandparents, Dorothy and Harry Kurth of Chevy Chase, MD. She also spent many weekends and holidays at the cherished gathering spot that was her maternal grandparents' home in Flemington, NJ. She and her parents would gather there with her grandparents, John F. Schenk and Elizabeth "Betty" Stryker Schenk; her maternal aunts and their husbands, Johanna "Joey" Schenk Studdiford and William "Bill" E. Studdiford; Mary Elizabeth "Betsy" Schenk Trapp and Martin Anthony "Tony" Trapp; her maternal uncle, John "Johnny" F. H. Schenk and his wife, Mary Schenk; as well as her cousins, whom she thought of as siblings, as they did her. The cousins feel a deep loss over Kate's passing, as though a hole has opened up in the world, and they will always miss her keen intelligence, her wonderful laugh, and her loving heart. Kate loved her family and friends fiercely and without reservation, was "Nanny Kate" to several children, and many were honored to call her their best and lifelong friend. She will be forever in the hearts of all who knew and loved her. Kate is survived by her cousins, Andrew "Andy" Douglass Studdiford, of Point Pleasant, NJ; Elizabeth "Betsy" Studdiford Hardiman, of Redondo Beach, CA; Johanna "Josie" Trapp Miller, of Cary, NC; Gerada "Rada" Trapp Starkey and her husband, Robert "Rob" Wallace Starkey, of Sedgwick, ME; and Michael "Mickey" Schenk of Woodland Park, CO.
Services, hosted by her Maine family, Rada and Rob Starkey, will occur next summer on or around Kate's date of birth, at a place and time of year that she loved. Donations can be made at any time in memory of Kate to one of the following Maine conservation charities:

Texto completo: Special to the Star Tribune
I first encountered Israeli writer Etgar Keret in a 2006 essay in the New York Times magazine about arriving at a hospital with his wife in labor minutes before the place was flooded with victims of a bombing. "I just hate terror attacks," said a nurse. "They put a damper on everything."
A journalist covering the incident recognized Keret and was disappointed to learn that he was there for other reasons. "A reaction from a writer would've been good for my article," the journalist said. "After every attack, I always get the same reactions: 'Suddenly, I heard a boom'; 'I don't know what happened'; 'Everything was covered in blood.' How much of that can you take?"
For Keret, the line between funny and sad is no line at all. It's a territory, a borderland where one does not exist without the other. The 22 stories (or 23 if you count a running e-mail correspondence sandwiched between pieces) in his new collection, "Fly Already," all exist in this liminal space, accessed from Tel Aviv, Switzerland, Cleveland, Fat Charley's Diner, an escape room called the Glitch at the Edge of the Galaxy and heaven.
One favorite Keret theme is fatherhood. In the title story, "Fly Already," the narrator and his son try to stop a man from jumping off a building but are mistaken for a man trying to throw his son off a building. In "To the Moon and Back," a divorced dad at a candy store with his little boy offers to buy him any one thing in the place. Unfortunately, the kid chooses the cash register, and instead of pointing out that this is impossible, Dad leans in.
The three children in "Dad With Mashed Potatoes" come home to find their father has turned into a white rabbit. Preferring to believe that her husband has walked out on the family, Mom says they have to get rid of him.
Also charming are Keret's bro-ish metafictional fables, such as "Todd," which starts and ends with the line, "My friend Todd wants me to write him a story that will help him get girls into bed."
"Pineapple Crush" is about an underachieving slacker who scores some fantastic weed: "The first hit of the day is like a childhood friend, a first love, a commercial for life." If only life could live up to its advertising.
Even when the stories move into surrealist settings -- an orphanage/cloning center, a windowless cell controlled by an app and a friendly support team -- the language remains down-to-earth, funny and cool, Denis Johnson-esque. Translated into English by five people, it suggests that the distance between Hebrew and English is not so great. Heartbreaking, absurdly funny, disturbing and comforting, Keret's stories bridge worlds.

THE RIGHT TO SAFETY VS. THE RIGHT TO STRIKE THE BOSTON POLICE STRIKE OF 1919 STILL RAISES FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS

Texto completo: BOSTON
Official government documents often are masterpieces of deadened prose, but few contain an understatement quite like this sentence, from the Annual Report of the Police Department for the City of Boston, issued at the end of 1919:
"It is unfortunate that there were no provisions of law adequate to meet the circumstances of this extraordinary situation."
The "extraordinary situation" occurred a century ago this week. It was the strike of more than 1,100 Boston police officers, and its implications went far beyond the city, where rioting and lawlessness prevailed in an atmosphere of crisis and terror. By the time the conflict ended, organized labor received a serious setback, the very notion of police unions was under assault, and an obscure, introverted governor with old-fashioned rectitude, rusticated habits and an aversion to soaring rhetoric was on the path to national celebrity and, eventually, the White House.
"The strike was about better wages for the police but also recognition of the union," said Steve Striffler, director of the Labor Resource Center and Labor Studies Program at the University of Massachusetts, Boston. "That was not common, as unions and collective bargaining were looked at with suspicion two years after the Russian Revolution - and public employees didn't usually go on strike."
Today hardly anyone outside Boston - indeed, hardly anyone in Boston - pays much mind to the Boston police strike. In fact, it was overshadowed in 1919 by the Black Sox baseball scandal nationwide and by the tragic explosion of a storage tank in Boston's North End that set a torrid river of 21 million gallons of hot, sticky molasses barreling through city streets, trapping horses, crushing buildings and leaving 21 dead and 150 injured.
But the fluid dynamics of the Boston police strike had great implications for the nation's politics.
"This strike was a huge moment in the labor movement," said former U.S. Rep. Bill Delahunt, the grandson of a patrolman who led his fellow officers out of the Joy Street station, then the largest precinct in the city. "These men worked 96-hour weeks. There was no overtime. Their strike awakened the conscience of society, and they were the people who opened the public's eyes - and though they did not benefit from it, their courage gave the labor movement a respectability."
Mr. Delahunt's family lore maintains that his grandfather was personally fired by Gov. Calvin Coolidge, who won national attention for stating, in another 1919 single sentence freighted with enormous significance, "There is no right to strike against the public safety by anybody, anywhere, any time."
It was typical, and ironic, that Coolidge, known for relentless reticence, should emerge as a formidable political figure on the basis of a mere 24 syllables. Nine months later, Coolidge would become the Republican vice-presidential nominee and then, in 1923, would ascend to the White House when Warren G. Harding died.
This was a conflict with context. World War I had ended a year earlier, wages were static, slogans of socialism and communism circulated with ease and with growing appeal. In a 1966 article in the journal Labor History, University of Toledo professor Joseph Slater argued that the strike was "intimately connected to nationwide battles" over the issue of police unions.
In Boston, telephone workers and elevator carmen already had struck, and police officers saw that the strikers had won higher wages.
"This occurred in a very angry period in American history, with enormous hysteria over radicals," said Michael S. Dukakis, who followed Coolidge in the governor's office on Beacon Hill 55 years later and, though a Democrat, developed a late-life affinity for his Republican predecessor. "But when cops walk off the job, bad things can happen - and I don't think Coolidge had any alternative."
The strike brought violence and looting. Store windows were broken, fights broke out in the streets, mobs formed and reformed. "Freed from the restraining of the law," The New York Times reported, "hundreds of young gangsters and hoodlums in a few districts proceeded at once to break windows, loot stores, and cause disorder."
More than 250 Harvard students and 150 Harvard faculty and alumni heeded the call "to prepare themselves for such service as the Governor of the Commonwealth may call upon them to render." The volunteers included a Harvard alumnus with the evocative Yankee name of Godfrey Lowell Cabot who, with pistols on his belt, reported for duty cloaked in a naval cape.
Eventually the police department fired the strikers and hired replacement officers. The strike was over. Some 18 years later, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who was Coolidge's opponent for vice president in the 1920 national election, essentially sided with Coolidge. So did public officials from coast to coast, though the pain of the strike was felt most severely in Boston.
"The failure of the Boston strike saw the ebb tide for the police, leaving the strikers high and dry," a young witness to the strike, Francis Russell, wrote in a 1975 account titled "A City in Terror."
Some of the police officers were blackballed and never worked again. In one family the children were scattered with various relatives. Many moved. One went to work for the Charlestown State Prison and was shot and killed on Christmas Eve. Another went to work in nearby Newton, Mass., as a plumber, and his two sons became police officers there, both dying on duty.
"For so many of them, the situation was devastating," said Margaret R. Sullivan, the records manager and archivist of the Boston Police Department, where efforts are underway to assemble the stories of the strikers. "The one thing about being a police officer in Boston was security, and even in recessions the police were safe. People knew they would get a paycheck. Then men knew they could afford to get married. What was lost was that security."
The strike raised serious questions about whether workers in one segment of society lacked the labor rights, including the right to strike, of workers in the rest of society - and whether the public's right to safety and security trumps workers' rights to strike.
"The strike was crushed but the issue was not settled," Richard L. Lyons wrote in The New England Quarterly. "It remains unsettled to this day." Lyons, who died in 2011, wrote that assessment in June 1947. It is just as true in 2019, a century after the Boston police strike.

Texto completo: Super Pumped
The Battle for Uber
By Mike Isaac

Norton: 408 pages, $27.95
--
You'd expect a private security firm -- say, the notorious Blackwater -- to employ ex-CIA, Secret Service and FBI operatives to snoop on enemies and conduct espionage, tailing political figures, snapping their photos and communicating through an encrypted app that keeps messages from being traced.
But a San Francisco ride-sharing company?
Yet, indeed it was so, as Mike Isaac reveals in "Super Pumped: The Battle for Uber." The New York Times technology reporter spins a compelling yarn that chronicles the transit company's unruly development, from its two-entrepreneur start-up days in 2009 to its explosive expansion into a publicly traded billion-dollar global behemoth, often aided by spying on competitors and outwitting transportation regulators.
For those unfamiliar with Uber's early days, the pioneering ride-hailing service took off when the invention of the iPhone delivered a seamless path to beating traffic and the entrenched taxi cab industry. An Uber app displays a street map that connects needy riders with passing drivers, all paid for by credit card so no one fumbles for change.
The book's central character is founder Travis Kalanick, whose steady rise and ultimately humiliating downfall has long been in the news. But Isaac goes deeper into how this sometimes mesmerizing, always frenetic product of Northridge and UCLA developed his tireless drive to win, even if it meant burning through billions of dollars in expenses or surveilling the movements of competitors such as Lyft.
"One Lyft executive grew so paranoid about being followed by Uber," Isaac writes, "that he walked out onto his porch, lifted both middle fingers in the air and waved them around, sending a message to the spies he was absolutely sure were watching."
For every round of business success in Uber's early days, Kalanick would keep his workforce "super pumped" by throwing lavish bacchanales in places like Miami and Las Vegas, the latter capped with a special appearance by Beyonce. Misbehavior was common.
Kalanick was so eager to constantly expand that he let his managers run their own far-flung regions, regardless of how inexperienced they were at directing people or spending the hefty budgets Uber provided for advertising or discounts that might spur ridership. It was a "brilliant" move, Isaac writes, even if "giving too much autonomy to a legion of twentysomethings" let some managers go off the rails. The New York office was infamous for its aggressive "bro culture." And one tacky promotion in France offered "free rides from incredibly hot chicks."
Isaac also provides a cogent explanation of what it takes to succeed in the multibillion-dollar tech world of Silicon Valley. If you don't know what the all-important venture capitalist really does, for instance, this book will tell you.
Much of any VC's success depends on finding the right "founder," someone who not only holds the vision but has the stamina to devote every waking hour to building out and scaling up while attracting investors and inspiring employees to work just as hard. Kalanick was all that.
Kalanick viewed Uber as a crusader "battling the under-handed, street-fighting entrenched interests ... who were colluding to keep taxi service bad and overpriced." He would launch Uber into city after city without going through the usual regulatory channels, such as paying medallion fees required of cab drivers.
"There's been so much corruption and so much cronyism in the taxi industry ... that if you ask for permission upfront for something that is already legal, you'll never get it," Kalanick once told a reporter.
Uber strike teams would descend on a region like paratroopers, at first contacting limousine and town car companies and persuading their drivers to fill idle hours by working with Uber. The "guerrilla tactics far outmatched the resources and technical acumen of government workers or taxi operators," Isaac writes.
And inside state capitols and city halls, the company was ready to play hardball: At one point, Uber employed more lobbyists than Amazon, Microsoft and Walmart combined, Isaac reports.
It was the rise of Lyft that caused Uber to shift from hiring only limo and town car drivers, who were already licensed and insured livery vehicle operators. Lyft began letting anyone with a Class C license shuttle passengers using their own personal cars, meaning it had no fleet to lease, insure, keep fueled or service. So Uber did the same.
Lyft was a particular burr under Kalanick's saddle. A la President Trump, he would use Twitter to needle Lyft's founders -- "You've got a lot of catching up to do" -- and he worked to impede their growth by dissuading venture capital firms from providing any money. Uber even bought a billboard in San Francisco, showing a giant razor blade about to take a swipe at a pink mustache, Lyft's trademark.
But like a tenderfoot scout who confidently builds a campfire only to end up burning down the forest, Kalanick's loose management -- of his staff and himself -- paved the way for a cascade of embarrassing scandals by 2014.
Apple executives were outraged when Uber engineers found a way to defeat an iPhone privacy update because it blocked them from tracking accounts created by fraudsters in China. There was a dust-up over whether Uber's self-driving car division was using data swiped from Google. A resulting lawsuit was settled in 2018 when Uber gave Google $245-million worth of stock. (On Aug. 27, a federal grand jury indicted former Uber engineer Anthony Levan-dowski on 33 counts of stealing or trying to steal trade secrets he obtained when he worked at Google.)
And in 2015, an Uber manager was accused of propositioning Susan Fowler, a young site reliability engineer, on her first day on the job. When Fowler reported the harassment, human resource representatives said they would only reprimand the manager since he was a "high performer" who had no other complaints against him. She later found out that other women had also been targeted. After only a year, she left Uber -- and blogged about her experience.
Just as the #MeToo movement was gaining political steam in 2017, the blog details catapulted Fowler onto the cover of Time magazine's Person of the Year issue, alongside actress Ashley Judd (Harvey Weinstein), Taylor Swift (a Denver radio DJ) and more than 30 other sexual harassment "silence breakers."
Former Atty. Gen. Eric Holder was hired by the company to investigate that and other Uber missteps, and the report he delivered was a shocker. According to Isaac, Uber board member Bill Gurley, the venture capitalist closest to Kalanick, felt it "read like a lewd magazine, a racist, sexist Silicon Valley bachelor party."
By then, the board of directors knew Kalanick had to go if Uber was to survive.
This is no dry business profile but a tale that Isaac has deeply reported yet still made accessible. The details about how Kalanick furiously scrambled to fight back would make a darn good Hollywood movie. But kids, don't wait for that: Look up from your phones now and see where all those Uber fares have really been going. It won't take long.

Texto completo: Nearly a month after his death, Jeffrey Epstein continues to haunt some of America's most prestigious institutions.
On Saturday, a prominent figure at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology stepped down after the disclosure of his efforts to conceal his financial connections to Mr. Epstein, the disgraced financier who killed himself in a Manhattan jail cell last month while facing federal sex trafficking charges.
Almost immediately, the M.I.T. official, Joichi Ito, left the boards of three other organizations: the MacArthur Foundation, the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, and The New York Times Company, where he had been a board member since 2012. He also left a visiting professorship at Harvard.
Mr. Ito, the tech evangelist and master networker who led the M.I.T. Media Lab -- a program that prides itself on contrarian thinking -- acknowledged last week that he had received $ 1.7 million from Mr. Epstein, including $ 1.2 million for his own outside investment funds.
"After giving the matter a great deal of thought over the past several days and weeks, I think that it is best that I resign as director of the media lab and as a professor and employee of the Institute, effective immediately," Mr. Ito wrote in an email on Saturday to M.I.T.'s provost, Martin A. Schmidt.
Mr. Ito's resignation came less than a day after an article in The New Yorker described the measures that he and other media lab officials took to conceal its relationship with Mr. Epstein. The internal emails, which a former media lab employee shared with The New York Times, described the handling of donations that Mr. Epstein made and apparently solicited from the rich and powerful over the years, including a $ 2 million gift from the Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates.
In an email in October 2014 -- six years after Mr. Epstein had pleaded guilty to a sex charge involving a minor in Florida -- Mr. Ito wrote that the gift from Mr. Gates had been "directed by Jeffrey Epstein." A development official at the media lab, Peter Cohen, wrote in a subsequent email, "For gift recording purposes, we will not be mentioning Jeffrey's name as the impetus for this gift."
In a statement, a spokesman for Mr. Gates said Mr. Epstein had been introduced to Mr. Gates as a person interested in helping increase philanthropy. "Although Epstein pursued Bill Gates aggressively, any account of a business partnership or personal relationship between the two is simply not true," the statement said. "And any claim that Epstein directed any programmatic or personal grant making for Bill Gates is completely false."
Mr. Gates -- one of the world's richest men and perhaps its most generous philanthropist -- is one of many powerful people to face scrutiny for their connections to Mr. Epstein. President Trump and former President Bill Clinton have been forced to explain their associations with him. So have Britain's Prince Andrew, high-profile scientists and business executives including Leslie Wexner, the chief executive of L Brands, and Leon Black, the founder of Apollo Global Management, one of the world's biggest private equity firms. R. Alexander Acosta, who as a federal prosecutor was involved in the plea agreement with Mr. Epstein in 2008, stepped down as labor secretary after that deal was heavily criticized.
Mr. Ito's resignation from M.I.T. was followed in quick succession by announcements from other organizations.
The MacArthur Foundation said reports about his actions, if true, were not in keeping with its values. "Most importantly, our hearts go out to the girls and women who survived the abuse of Jeffrey Epstein," the foundation said in a statement.
A.G. Sulzberger, the publisher of The Times, and the company's president, Mark Thompson, wrote an email to staff members that Mr. Ito had stepped down, effective immediately. "Our newsroom will continue its aggressive reporting on Mr. Epstein, investigating both the individuals and the broader systems of power that enabled him for so many years," they said.
Signe Swenson, who served as a development associate and alumni relations coordinator at the M.I.T. Media Lab from 2014 to 2016, shared the internal emails concerning Mr. Epstein with The Times. She said she had told supervisors several times of her "disgust" at Mr. Epstein's involvement.
"That was never listened to," Ms. Swenson, who worked under Mr. Cohen, said in an interview on Saturday. Ms. Swenson shared the correspondence after consulting with the organization Whistleblower Aid.
She said she learned of Mr. Epstein's connection with the media lab when she interviewed for a position in March 2014, and told Mr. Cohen that M.I.T. listed Mr. Epstein as "disqualified" as a donor. She said Mr. Cohen replied that Mr. Ito had a relationship with the wealthy financier. In one 2014 email that Ms. Swenson shared, Mr. Ito wrote about a $ 100,000 donation from Mr. Epstein, asking the development staff members to "make sure this gets accounted for as anonymous."
Mr. Ito took over the Media Lab in 2011 following a rapid ascent in the tech world that made him an unorthodox choice to lead an academic program, but not the freewheeling media lab. He was a two-time college dropout who had run a nightclub, then ran a string of internet companies and invested early in Twitter, Kickstarter and Flickr.
He was also a master networker -- one who visited the Obama White House to discuss artificial intelligence and became friends with the respected Harvard lawyer Lawrence Lessig after criticizing Mr. Lessig's book when he gave a talk in Japan. Mr. Lessig later put Mr. Ito on the board of Creative Commons, a nonprofit advocate for public intellectual property rights.
Mr. Ito's ability to connect with both students and wealthy donors had helped him raise at least $ 50 million for the Media Lab, a sort of academic skunkworks. It has contributed to the development of technology related to touchscreens and GPS, is home to a program dedicated to democratizing access to outer space and hands out $ 250,000 awards to those "challenging the norms, rules or laws that sustain society's injustices."
Mr. Ito faced significant criticism from inside the Media Lab. Two scholars said they would leave at the end of the academic year, with one saying he had urged Mr. Ito not to associate with Mr. Epstein. While Mr. Ito did enjoy the support of many within the lab, there were calls for his resignation.
"We have worked literally for years to try to make STEM fields safe and welcoming, attractive fields for women and girls in the face of crushing sexism and gender bias," said Kim Holleman, an artist who was a visiting scholar and a research affiliate at the media lab from 2013 through 2017. "It's humiliating to know that men in these institutions, in 2019, still think so little of women's dignity and safety."
At a meeting on Wednesday night with media lab personnel, Mr. Ito said he had "screwed up" by accepting the money, but that he had done so after a review by the university and consultation with his advisers.
On Saturday, the university's president, L. Rafael Reif, said he had asked M.I.T.'s general counsel to hire an outside law firm to conduct "an immediate, thorough and independent investigation."
"We are actively assessing how best to improve our policies, processes and procedures to fully reflect M.I.T.'s values and prevent such mistakes in the future," he wrote in an email to the university community. "Our internal review process continues, and what we learn from it will inform the path ahead."
The emails provided by Ms. Swenson outlined the informal role that Mr. Epstein played at the media lab. In the correspondence about the donation from Mr. Gates, Mr. Cohen wrote that Mr. Ito "did not talk with Bill Gates" and that the program "did not solicit this money." In another, from May 2014, Mr. Cohen and Mr. Ito discussed Mr. Epstein helping connect the media lab to Mr. Black, the Apollo Global Management founder, who Mr. Epstein had advised on issues including philanthropy.
Mr. Cohen wrote that Mr. Black wanted to make a large donation "in honor of a friend, who wishes to remain anonymous," and later asked Mr. Ito to find out from Mr. Epstein whether Mr. Black himself wanted to remain anonymous. One email indicated that Mr. Black had given the media lab a gift of $ 4 million by wire transfer.
Mr. Cohen also asked Mr. Ito whether Mr. Black would like a thank-you note from M.I.T.'s president. Mr. Black's preference would be something "you or Jeffrey knows best," he wrote.
A spokeswoman for Mr. Black did not comment on Saturday. Mr. Black has sought to distance himself from Mr. Epstein, describing his interactions with him as limited to tax strategy, estate planning and philanthropic advice. He has also said Apollo had never done business with Mr. Epstein.
Mr. Cohen, now the director of development for computer and data science initiatives at Brown University, did not respond to messages seeking comment on Saturday.
The departure of Mr. Ito from the media lab came after he spent days trying to make amends. At Wednesday's meeting, which was organized by professors at the program, he reiterated his apology. He described for the first time the amount of money he had received from Mr. Epstein, and said he had twice traveled to Mr. Epstein's island home in the Caribbean to seek donations. He also told the crowd he had returned one check that Mr. Epstein had sent him earlier this year, after an article in the Miami Herald prompted heavy criticism of Mr. Epstein's plea agreement in Florida in 2008.
But near the end, one of Mr. Ito's staunchest supporters, Nicholas Negroponte, a founder of the media lab, said he had told Mr. Ito to take the money and would do it again. That prompted Mr. Ito to send an email to Mr. Negroponte in the middle of the night, complaining that he was undercutting his ability to make amends.
The situation worsened with the disclosure of the lab's internal emails. An online petition established in support of Mr. Ito put a disclaimer at the top that it had been set up before news of the emails circulated. A few hours later, Mr. Ito tendered the first of several resignations he offered on Saturday afternoon.
By Saturday night, the petition site was no longer online.

Texto completo: Two months after President Trump shook hands with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un at the Korean demilitarized zone, his administration remains stymied in its efforts to coax Pyongyang back to the negotiating table, leading to mounting frustrations that time is running out while Kim has strengthened his position.
In a new letter to Trump on Friday, leading Senate Democrats are calling the North's recent short-range missile tests "a significant step backwards" and demanding that the United States hold Kim's regime accountable for actions that "clearly contravene" U.N. Security Council resolutions, according to a copy obtained by The Washington Post.
A leading Washington think tank concluded in a public assessment published Friday that an undisclosed North Korean operating base in Kumchon-ni houses medium-range ballistic missiles capable of striking southern Japan as well as the outskirts of Tokyo.
And the State Department, whose efforts to engage North Korean diplomats have floundered, is weighing new steps to publicly pressure the Kim regime during the U.N. General Assembly in New York this month, said officials with knowledge of the internal deliberations.
The developments stand in sharp contrast to Trump's efforts in recent weeks to play down friction with the North in an effort to maintain a personal relationship with Kim that has driven his unorthodox strategy to force one of the world's most brutal and dangerous regimes to relinquish its nuclear arsenal.
"The president is increasingly isolated within his own government on this policy," said Victor Cha, Korea chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), whose program published the assessment of the Kumchon-ni facility.
Cha noted that Trump said last month that he had received a letter from Kim suggesting talks would resume after the completion of annual joint military exercises between the United States and South Korea, which ended two weeks ago.
"I sense a lot of frustration that nothing is going on," Cha said of the president's aides. "They promised in August that these things would happen."
White House officials declined to comment.
Kim has unsettled East Asia this summer with tests of short-range missiles that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called a clear violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions. But Trump has consistently maintained that the tests do not violate a personal pledge Kim made during their first summit in Singapore last year to refrain from testing intercontinental ballistic missiles or nuclear weapons.
Despite Trump's unwillingness to criticize Kim, U.S. officials have been rebuffed time and again in their overtures to Kim's underlings since the two leaders met at the Korean DMZ in late June, according to people briefed on the matter.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's hopes for a meeting with Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho at the U.N. General Assembly were dashed when the North announced this week it would not participate in the international gathering, a shift from the past three years, when high-level delegations attended.
Two weeks ago, Ri insulted Pompeo, whom Pyongyang views as a hard-liner, by calling him "poisonous" to diplomacy.
During a private briefing on Capitol Hill last week, a senior Trump administration official told congressional staffers that U.S. officials were continuing to reach out to Pyongyang but had heard nothing back, according to a person familiar with the discussion.
"As we have indicated, we are prepared to engage in negotiations as soon as we hear from our counterparts in North Korea," a State Department official told The Post, when asked for a response regarding Ri's criticism of Pompeo. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation.
Jean H. Lee, a Korea expert at the Wilson Center who spent five years as the Associated Press bureau chief in Pyongyang, said the North Koreans have signaled uncertainty over how to proceed ahead of an end-of-the-year deadline, set by Kim, to walk away from bilateral engagement if there is no deal.
Kim tested Trump in launching the short-range missiles. Now, Lee said, the North Korean leader could be contemplating whether to ratchet up the stakes by "doing something more provocative."
Trump has consistently framed his North Korea diplomacy as a success, touting Pyongyang's nuclear test moratorium and emphasizing that his administration has maintained tough economic sanctions on the Kim regime.
But experts said Kim has used the period of engagement to accelerate development on other aspects of his missile programs. The New York Times reported this week that Kim's regime has greatly improved the "range and maneuverability" of its weapons systems.
The new assessment from CSIS's "Beyond Parallel" program provides significant insights into one of the North's estimated 20 ballistic missile operations that the Kim regime has not disclosed to the public.
The facility at Kumchon-ni is located less than 50 miles north of the DMZ and is equipped with Hwasong-9 medium-range ballistic missiles capable of striking throughout South Korea in addition to southern Japan, according to the report.
The findings come as Japan and South Korea have ended an intelligence-sharing agreement amid a worsening diplomatic row that has roots in historical grievances dating to Japan's wartime occupation of the Korean Peninsula.
"North Korea's ballistic threat is significant," said Joseph S. Bermudez Jr., a CSIS analyst who compiled the report based on commercial satellite imagery, declassified government reports and interviews. "It is growing, and it is something that needs to be addressed not only for the United States but for allies in Japan and South Korea."
In their letter to Trump, eight Democratic senators, including Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.), Richard J. Durbin (Ill.) and Robert Menendez (N.J.), call on him to use the U.N. General Assembly to push for accountability measures on the North's missile activities while also seeking to "establish the sort of regular working-level negotiations necessary for diplomacy to succeed."
Yet it's not clear how such talks would resume. Trump's second summit with Kim in Hanoi in February collapsed after Kim offered to close a major nuclear processing facility in exchange for relief from economic sanctions, but Trump demanded that the North agree to relinquish its entire nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Since then, neither side has signaled a willingness to offer concessions. The standoff comes amid reports that Stephen Biegun, the lead U.S. negotiator with North Korea, would be in the running for a promotion to deputy secretary of state if Trump taps John Sullivan as the new ambassador to Russia. In that event, Biegun probably would stay involved in the talks but appoint a deputy to manage the negotiations on a day-to-day basis.
U.S. officials have cautioned that nothing has been decided.
Michael Green, who served as a top Asia policy official in the George W. Bush administration, said Japanese and South Korean diplomats have grown increasingly pessimistic about the future of the negotiations.
North Korea's success in developing its weapons capabilities could provide Kim with increased leverage in the negotiations and the ability to "escalate the situation when the time is right to test again," Green said. "Everyone I talk to on both sides think that's where it's headed - toward another crisis."

Texto completo: No. 15 Penn State (1-0) vs. Buffalo (1-0)
7:30 p.m. at Beaver Stadium
* TV: Fox Sports
* Series history: Penn State leads 2-1
*Last meeting: Penn State 27-14 in 2015

FIVE THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW
1. Penn State seeks its ninth consecutive win over a non-conference opponent dating to the 2016 loss to Pitt.
2. Buffalo has beaten Penn State once: 10-0 in 1900.
3. Penn State's 673 yards of offense against Idaho were the third-most in program history.
4. Buffalo is playing a nationally televised network game for the first time.
5. This is the only game Buffalo will play on grass during the regular season.
THE STORY LINE
The best moment of Penn State's first night game might come at halftime. Members of the 1994 team will be in town to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Penn State's last undefeated season, when they went 12-0, won the Rose Bowl and lost out on a national title to Nebraska.
(But there was that New York Times national championship).
In 1994, Penn State coach James Franklin was a senior quarterback at East Stroudsburg, where he threw for a then-record 2,586 yards and 14 touchdowns. Franklin said this week that he was aware of Penn State's 1994 team then but is more impressed with its achievements now.
"After being a head coach in the SEC and being a head coach in the Big Ten, I think what they did is very impressive," Franklin said. "It's also interesting because there's a lot of discussions about national championships, and I think we've got some pretty good arguments over our history about national championships. I'm not sure how that necessarily works. Some people can decide their national championships and put it up and others can't, but I think we've got some pretty good arguments."
Franklin invited the returning players to practice, hoping they might share some of the program's legacy with current members of the team. Time certainly strains the ties; no one on Penn State's roster even was born when the 1994 team went undefeated. Last December, former quarterbacks Trace McSorley and Kerry Collins met in New York, bridging past and present.
Franklin wants to do more of that this weekend.
"The '90s does not seem that long ago to me, but to our players it does," Franklin said. "And I think also for our players, part of their education is not only what they learn in the classroom at Penn State and this community and through their football experience, but also the historical impact of Penn State football. They're a part of that now."
KEEP AN EYE ON...
PENN STATE
Running back Ricky Slade: The redshirt freshman didn't have the rushing success of his fellow backs (5 carries, 9 yards) last week and will want to assert himself.
Linebacker Cam Brown: Returns to the starting lineup after serving his bowl suspension for targeting last week. Could be busy against a run-happy offense.
Receiver Weston Carr: Having transferred from Division II Azusa Pacific, Carr made a quick impact with 3 catches for 27 yards. Look for him to grow more into a role behind Jahan Dotson.
BUFFALO
Linebacker James Patterson: Jaret's twin brother led the team in tackles last season (77).
Left tackle Evin Ksiezarczyk: Combines with guard Paul Nosworthy to give the Bulls a strong left-side to their line.
Tight end Zac Lefebvre: Caught 2 touchdown passes against Robert Morris.
PICK: PSU 48, BUFFALO 7
Mark Wogenrich: Penn State's gradual incline of a schedule continues. Buffalo's coming off a great season (10-4, MAC championship-game appearance) and would have challenged the Lions last year.
But Penn State will constrict Buffalo's one-note offense, holding the Bulls to under 100 yards rushing. Meanwhile, quarterback Sean Clifford grows more into his role with 3 touchdown passes.

Texto completo: Russia and Ukraine swapped dozens of prisoners in a deal many see as a diplomatic victory for both nations and a step to deescalating tensions.
Planes carrying prisoners took off from each nation's capital about the same time on Saturday, according to the New York Times. The gesture is seen as a significant step toward repairing relations between the two countries since Russia took over Crimea in 2014 and armed separatists in Eastern Ukraine, driving a conflict that has resulted in roughly 13,000 deaths.
World leaders celebrated the deal struck between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, who took office in May.
"Russia and Ukraine just swapped large numbers of prisoners. Very good news, perhaps a first giant step to peace. Congratulations to both countries!" President Trump said on Twitter.
Tweet
German Chancellor Angela Merkel called the prisoner swap "a hopeful sign." European Council President Donald Tusk also celebrated the trade.
"Finally! The release of Oleg #Sentsov and the Ukrainian sailors fills me with relief. I continue my call on Russia to release all political prisoners and respect Ukraine’s territorial integrity," Tusk said on Twitter.
Tweet
Ukraine is receiving 24 sailors who were detained by Russia in the Kerch Strait last year, as well as 11 other prisoners, including the Ukrainian filmmaker Sentsov. The filmmaker had been sentenced to two decades in prison on terrorism charges.
Russia received dozens from Ukraine, including Kirill Vyshinsky, a journalist accused of treason in Ukraine. Ukraine also returned Volodymyr Tsemakh, a suspect in the downing of a Malaysia Airlines flight over Eastern Ukraine in 2015. The crash killed 298 people.
NATO spokesperson Oana Lungescu called the exchange a "step in the right direction" but asked that Russia continues to fulfill "all its obligations under the Minsk Agreements, including the release of all prisoners."
"At the same time, it remains important to establish the truth and accountability for the downing of flight MH17, in line with United Nations Security Council Resolution 2166," the spokesperson added.

Texto completo: El presidente Donald Trump dijo el sábado que canceló las reuniones secretas con los líderes talibanes y el presidente de Afganistán Ashraf Ghani, que se realizarían el domingo en Camp David y suspendió las negociaciones de paz en curso, después de que los talibanes admitieran la responsabilidad de un reciente ataque en el que murió un soldado estadounidense.
Trump dijo enojado que “para construir una influencia falsa”, los talibanes habían admitido un ataque suicida con coche bomba que había matado a un soldado estadounidense y a otras 11 personas en la capital de Kabul.
En una serie de tuits, Trump dijo que tenía previsto reunirse con líderes talibanes en Camp David este domingo.
Sin embargo , canceló la reunión y suspendió las negociaciones. El negociador estadounidense Zalmay Khalilzad había anunciado un acuerdo de paz “en principio” con los talibanes el lunes.
“Sin que lo supieran casi todos, los principales líderes talibanes y, por separado, el presidente de Afganistán, se reunirían conmigo en secreto en Camp David el domingo. Iban a estar en Estados Unidos esta noche”, tuiteó Trump.
“Desafortunadamente, para construir una influencia falsa, admitieron un ataque en Kabul que mató a uno de nuestros grandes grandes soldados y a otras 11 personas. Inmediatamente cancelé la reunión y suspendí las negociaciones de paz. ¿Qué tipo de gente mataría a tantos con el fin de fortalecer aparentemente su posición de negociación?”
Trump continuó: “¡No lo hicieron, solo lo empeoraron! Si no pueden aceptar un alto el fuego durante estas conversaciones de paz muy importantes, e incluso matarían a 12 personas inocentes, entonces probablemente no tengan el poder de negociar un acuerdo significativo de todos modos. ¿Cuántas décadas más están dispuestos a luchar?”
Unbeknownst to almost everyone, the major Taliban leaders and, separately, the President of Afghanistan, were going to secretly meet with me at Camp David on Sunday. They were coming to the United States tonight. Unfortunately, in order to build false leverage, they admitted to..
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 7, 2019
….only made it worse! If they cannot agree to a ceasefire during these very important peace talks, and would even kill 12 innocent people, then they probably don’t have the power to negotiate a meaningful agreement anyway. How many more decades are they willing to fight?
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 7, 2019
Un ataque con coche bomba en Kabul el jueves mató al sargento de Primera Clase Elis A. Barreto Ortiz, de 34 años, de Puerto Rico.
Un miembro del servicio rumano también murió en el ataque, al igual que al menos 10 ciudadanos afganos. Fue el segundo ataque talibán en Kabul en menos de una semana. Los talibanes lanzaron delitos militares en tres provincias la semana pasada.
Los talibanes afirmaron que el aumento en los ataques está justificado para darles una posición más fuerte en las negociaciones , informó el viernes Charlie D’Agata de CBS News.
Al menos 16 miembros del ejército de EEUU han muerto en Afganistán este año, según el Departamento de Defensa.
Estados Unidos espera que su acuerdo con los talibanes lleve al grupo militante a la mesa para que comiencen las conversaciones dentro de Afganistán, antes de las elecciones presidenciales del 28 de septiembre, una reunión que el presidente Ghani insistió en que debe celebrarse a tiempo, y no ser modificada después por un gobierno interino.
Un alto funcionario de la administración dijo a The New York Times que la reunión se había planeado para el lunes, solo dos días antes del aniversario de los ataques del 11 de septiembre de 2001, que fueron planeados desde Afganistán y condujeron a la invasión de Estados Unidos al país.
Pocos detalles han surgido de las nueve rondas de conversaciones entre Estados Unidos y los talibanes durante casi un año.
Zalmay Khalilzad, el enviado de Trump a Afganistán, dijo que los primeros 5,000 soldados estadounidenses se retirarían de cinco bases en Afganistán dentro de los primeros 135 días de un acuerdo final. Entre 14,000 y 13,000 tropas están actualmente en el país.

Texto completo: El actor Brad Pitt reveló en una entrevista con el New York Times que tras su separación de la actriz Angelina Jolie acudió a reuniones de Alcohólicos Anónimos.
"Tenías a todos estos hombres sentados, abiertos y honestos de una manera que nunca había escuchado. Era este espacio seguro donde había poco juicio hacia ti mismo", comentó.
"Fue realmente liberador sólo exponer los lados feos de uno mismo. Hay un gran valor en ello".
La estrella de Había Una Vez en... Hollywood dijo que asistió a los encuentros durante un año y medio, y añadió que, tras haber llevado lejos su problema de consumo, quería eliminar sus privilegios de beber.
También contó que el escrutinio de Hollywood y de los medios desde los años 90 creó discrepancias en sus relaciones con Jolie y Jennifer Aniston, y que nunca se sintió bien con ello.
"Fue realmente incómodo para mí, la cacofonía de las expectativas y los juicios. Realmente me convertí en una especie de ermitaño y simplemente me uní al olvido", reconoció.
Tras su divorcio de la protagonista de Maléfica, el famoso comenzó a trabajar en varios proyectos, como Ad Astra: Hacia las Estrellas, que basó en su situación actual para desempeñar su papel.
"Definitivamente utilizó los estímulos de su vida. No me volví personal con él al respecto, no creo que sea asunto mío, ni siquiera mi trabajo, pero él investigó la esencia del personaje a través de sí mismo", señaló James Gray, director del filme.
Ad Astra: Hacia las Estrellas se estrenará en México el 20 de septiembre.

Iowa Republicans plan to go ahead with caucuses in 2020

Texto completo: The Republican Party of Iowa will hold its traditional straw poll at caucus meetings in February 2020, a spokesman said Friday, even as other states reportedly are planning to cancel their primaries and caucuses in a show of solidarity with Republican President Donald Trump.
Politico reported Friday morning that Republican parties in South Carolina, Nevada, Arizona and Kansas are expected to formally cancel their primaries and caucuses in an effort to stem any potential momentum for Republican challengers to the president.
"Our 2020 caucus plans remain unchanged," Republican Party of Iowa Chairman Jeff Kaufmann said in a statement Friday.
So far, former U.S. Rep. Joe Walsh of Illinois and former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld, both Republicans, have launched primary bids challenging Trump. Former South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford is also considering a bid. In a March Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacomm Iowa Poll, Republicans said they liked Trump, but many also said they would welcome challengers.
Kaufmann previously told the Des Moines Register that Iowa Republicans would hold their straw poll in 2020. He said he planned not to formally endorse any candidates or encourage Iowans to support one candidate. But, in most ways, he said, he'll be backing the president.
"I should be fired on the spot if I am not supporting the sitting president," he said at the time. "That is one of the fundamental duties (of my job)."
Iowa's first-in-the-nation presidential caucuses are typically quieter affairs for the party that controls the White House. In some cases, the party has chosen not to cast ballots in its caucus straw poll when a Republican incumbent is running, most recently in 1992.
The New York Times reported in February of that year: "Republicans have decided not to hold a straw poll at the start of their caucuses, apparently fearing that such a tally could diminish President (George H.W.) Bush's showing. Neither of the two Republican insurgents, Patrick J. Buchanan and David Duke, have mounted challenges here."

As Trump touts N. Korea talks as a success, signs of progress are hard to find

Texto completo: Two months after President Trump shook hands with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un at the Korean demilitarized zone, his administration remains stymied in its efforts to coax Pyongyang back to the negotiating table, leading to mounting frustrations that time is running out while Kim has strengthened his position.
In a new letter to Trump on Friday, leading Senate Democrats are calling the North's recent short-range missile tests "a significant step backwards" and demanding that the United States hold Kim's regime accountable for actions that "clearly contravene" U.N. Security Council resolutions, according to a copy obtained by The Washington Post.
A leading Washington think tank concluded in a public assessment published Friday that an undisclosed North Korean operating base in Kumchon-ni houses medium-range ballistic missiles capable of striking southern Japan as well as the outskirts of Tokyo.
And the State Department, whose efforts to engage North Korean diplomats have floundered, is weighing new steps to publicly pressure the Kim regime during the U.N. General Assembly in New York this month, said officials with knowledge of the internal deliberations.
The developments stand in sharp contrast to Trump's efforts in recent weeks to play down friction with the North in an effort to maintain a personal relationship with Kim that has driven his unorthodox strategy to force one of the world's most brutal and dangerous regimes to relinquish its nuclear arsenal.
"The president is increasingly isolated within his own government on this policy," said Victor Cha, Korea chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), whose program published the assessment of the Kumchon-ni facility.
Cha noted that Trump said last month that he had received a letter from Kim suggesting talks would resume after the completion of annual joint military exercises between the United States and South Korea, which ended two weeks ago.
"I sense a lot of frustration that nothing is going on," Cha said of the president's aides. "They promised in August that these things would happen."
White House officials declined to comment.
Kim has unsettled East Asia this summer with tests of short-range missiles that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called a clear violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions. But Trump has consistently maintained that the tests do not violate a personal pledge Kim made during their first summit in Singapore last year to refrain from testing intercontinental ballistic missiles or nuclear weapons.
Despite Trump's unwillingness to criticize Kim, U.S. officials have been rebuffed time and again in their overtures to Kim's underlings since the two leaders met at the Korean DMZ in late June, according to people briefed on the matter.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's hopes for a meeting with Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho at the U.N. General Assembly were dashed when the North announced this week it would not participate in the international gathering, a shift from the past three years, when high-level delegations attended.
Two weeks ago, Ri insulted Pompeo, whom Pyongyang views as a hard-liner, by calling him "poisonous" to diplomacy.
During a private briefing on Capitol Hill last week, a senior Trump administration official told congressional staffers that U.S. officials were continuing to reach out to Pyongyang but had heard nothing back, according to a person familiar with the discussion.
"As we have indicated, we are prepared to engage in negotiations as soon as we hear from our counterparts in North Korea," a State Department official told The Post, when asked for a response regarding Ri's criticism of Pompeo. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation.
Jean H. Lee, a Korea expert at the Wilson Center who spent five years as the Associated Press bureau chief in Pyongyang, said the North Koreans have signaled uncertainty over how to proceed ahead of an end-of-the-year deadline, set by Kim, to walk away from bilateral engagement if there is no deal.
Kim tested Trump in launching the short-range missiles. Now, Lee said, the North Korean leader could be contemplating whether to ratchet up the stakes by "doing something more provocative."
Trump has consistently framed his North Korea diplomacy as a success, touting Pyongyang's nuclear test moratorium and emphasizing that his administration has maintained tough economic sanctions on the Kim regime.
But experts said Kim has used the period of engagement to accelerate development on other aspects of his missile programs. The New York Times reported this week that Kim's regime has greatly improved the "range and maneuverability" of its weapons systems.
The new assessment from CSIS's "Beyond Parallel" program provides significant insights into one of the North's estimated 20 ballistic missile operations that the Kim regime has not disclosed to the public.
The facility at Kumchon-ni is located less than 50 miles north of the DMZ and is equipped with Hwasong-9 medium-range ballistic missiles capable of striking throughout South Korea in addition to southern Japan, according to the report.
The findings come as Japan and South Korea have ended an intelligence-sharing agreement amid a worsening diplomatic row that has roots in historical grievances dating to Japan's wartime occupation of the Korean Peninsula.
"North Korea's ballistic threat is significant," said Joseph S. Bermudez Jr., a CSIS analyst who compiled the report based on commercial satellite imagery, declassified government reports and interviews. "It is growing, and it is something that needs to be addressed not only for the United States but for allies in Japan and South Korea."
In their letter to Trump, eight Democratic senators, including Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.), Richard J. Durbin (Ill.) and Robert Menendez (N.J.), call on him to use the U.N. General Assembly to push for accountability measures on the North's missile activities while also seeking to "establish the sort of regular working-level negotiations necessary for diplomacy to succeed."
Yet it's not clear how such talks would resume. Trump's second summit with Kim in Hanoi in February collapsed after Kim offered to close a major nuclear processing facility in exchange for relief from economic sanctions, but Trump demanded that the North agree to relinquish its entire nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Since then, neither side has signaled a willingness to offer concessions. The standoff comes amid reports that Stephen Biegun, the lead U.S. negotiator with North Korea, would be in the running for a promotion to deputy secretary of state if Trump taps John Sullivan as the new ambassador to Russia. In that event, Biegun probably would stay involved in the talks but appoint a deputy to manage the negotiations on a day-to-day basis.
U.S. officials have cautioned that nothing has been decided.
Michael Green, who served as a top Asia policy official in the George W. Bush administration, said Japanese and South Korean diplomats have grown increasingly pessimistic about the future of the negotiations.
North Korea's success in developing its weapons capabilities could provide Kim with increased leverage in the negotiations and the ability to "escalate the situation when the time is right to test again," Green said. "Everyone I talk to on both sides think that's where it's headed - toward another crisis."

Texto completo: The world according to Jim (aka the ultimate Twitter thread, with everything in 280 characters or less):
• Going into Friday, the Dodgers had slugged an NL-record 250 home runs. The jewelers sponsoring the radio broadcasts give out a free bracelet for each homer. Have they run out of precious metals yet?
• So, when will they install the Dodger Stadium humidor?
• Sad to report that the Giants make their final visit to The Ravine this weekend and Madison Bumgarner isn’t scheduled to pitch. Like him or dislike him, the electricity when he faces the Dodgers is always fun.
• Then again, his favorite foils aren’t there. Max Muncy is hurt and Yasiel Puig is in Cleveland. But trust me: He’d find somebody else to annoy, or more accurately be annoyed by.
• It’s also the final visit to L.A. for Bruce Bochy as Giants manager. He may represent the enemy, Dodger fans, but he deserves your respect as the last of a managerial breed.
• There was angst here in 2017 when the Dodgers lost 11 straight and 16 of 17 and had their division lead shrink from 21 games to 9 in early September. Yet they reached Game 7 of the World Series. Are Dodger fans even more touchy now, fearful of more postseason doom?
• The boos Kenley Jansen hears from the home crowd every time he gives up a hit or walk should be a clue.
• But here’s another reminder: Every fan base in baseball hates its bullpen. (As this week’s Exhibit A, I give you the Mets.)
• Before Dave Roberts opted to skip Hyun-Jin Ryu’s turn next week, I suggested Ryu should come down with another convenient neck inflammation, the Dodgers’ all purpose injured list malady. His fatigue was that evident.
• Come to think of it, isn’t Kenley’s neck a little sore, too? (You know, whiplash from watching the ball fly over the fence.)
• Suggested reading, if you haven’t gotten to it already: “K: A History of Baseball in Ten Pitches,” by New York Times national baseball writer Tyler Kepner (who was, incidentally, a former Angels beat writer for The Press-Enterprise way back in the day).
• And a tip: When reading it, have a baseball nearby so you can fiddle with the grips he describes.
• Last week’s close USC victory over Fresno State shouldn’t have been that much of a surprise. Fresno State under Jeff Tedford is one of those Group of Five teams that deserves more recognition than it gets.
• They are the kind of program, in other words, that I’ve ranked above name schools as an AP Top 25 voter. (Which is part of why I’m no longer an AP Top 25 voter. I got tired of the weekly whining from fans of Power Five conference schools.)
• But this week it’s serious for the Trojans, and against Stanford we will discover a whole lot more about freshman Kedon Slovis. (It may be a little bit fairer fight with the Cardinal’s KJ Costello out, though replacement Davis Mills is a 20-year-old junior.)
• What was worse last week? The USC students with chests painted to spell “Fight On,” only the “G” was missing when the cameras found them? Or ESPN’s Rod Gilmore using the telestrator to illustrate where the “G” was supposed to go and botching it?
• FIHGT ON, indeed.
• UCLA has enough trouble selling football tickets. I’m not sure it helped that Saturday’s opponent at the Rose Bowl, San Diego State, beat Weber State 6-0 last week. Large multitudes may have decided to skip this one.
• Crowd counts aren’t always an accurate reflection, since college football attendance is down almost everywhere (even the SEC). But with UCLA, a continued lag in wins and customers might call the whole Chip Kelly Experiment into question.
• It was apparent all summer that Melvin Gordon had no leverage in his quest for a contract extension with the Chargers. Does he realize yet he’s tangling with the wrong organization when it comes to stubbornness?
• This, from the Rams’ Eric Weddle the other day about the Jared Goff extension: “It sets the standard that if you do things right on and off the field and you play at a high level, they’re gonna reward you.”
• He didn’t specifically reference Dean Spanos. But to anyone who remembers the events leading to Weddle leaving the Chargers after the 2015 season, the linkage was obvious.
• Remember when Southern California had its own wing of the Broadcasting Hall of Fame? Vin Scully, Chick Hearn, Dick Enberg and Bob Miller were quite a Mt. Rushmore, and Ralph Lawler made it a starting five.
• We could have four from the next generation, too: Joe Davis (Dodgers TV), Alex Faust (Kings TV), J.B. Long (Rams radio) and Brian Sieman (Clippers TV). (Sieman, the Clippers’ radio voice since ’07, would be the elder statesman of the group.)
• Davis and Orel Hershiser are really fun to listen to – but when Orel says “we,” “our,” and “us,” This Space cringes. Even on a (limited distribution) team-controlled channel, homer broadcasts just don’t go over well in the nation’s No. 2 market.
• Bottom line: What would Vin do?
• If you missed it, and you probably did, the Sparks clinched the third seed and a first-round playoff bye Thursday night. There are a lot of things with the WNBA that need fixing, but the quality of basketball absolutely is not one of them.

Paul Krugman: Under Trump it’s springtime for grifters

Texto completo: With each passing week it becomes ever clearer that President Donald Trump’s trade war, far from being “good, and easy to win,” is damaging large parts of the U.S. economy. Farmers are facing financial disaster; manufacturing, which Trump’s policies were supposed to revive, is contracting; consumer confidence is plunging, largely because the public (rightly) fears that tariffs will raise prices.
But Trump has an answer to his critics: It’s not me, it’s you. Last week he declared that businesses claiming to have been hurt by his tariffs should blame themselves, because they’re “badly run and weak.”
As with many Trump statements, one immediate thought that comes to mind is, how would Republicans have reacted if a Democratic president said something like that? In this case, however, we don’t have to speculate.
As some readers may recall, back in 2012 Barack Obama made the obvious and true point that businesses depend on public investments in things like roads and education as well as on their own efforts. Referring to those public investments, he said, “You didn’t build that.” The usual suspects pounced, taking the line out of context and claiming that he was disrespecting entrepreneurs; Mitt Romney made this claim a centerpiece of his presidential campaign.
Attacks on Obama as being anti-business were, of course, made in bad faith. Trump, however, really is denouncing businesses and blaming them for the problems his policies have created. And tariffs aren’t the only policy area where Trump and American business are now at odds.
Some of Trump’s most consequential actions involve his frantic efforts to dismantle environmental regulation. Unlike tariffs, this may at first sound like something business would want.
It turns out, however, that many businesses want to keep those regulations in place. Major oil and gas producers oppose Trump’s relaxation of rules on emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Major auto producers have come out against Trump’s attempt to roll back fuel efficiency standards. In fact, in a move that has reportedly enraged Trump, several companies have reached an agreement with the state of California to stick with Obama-era rules despite the change in federal policy.
When Trump won his upset victory in 2016, many investors assumed that his rule would be good for business. And he did indeed give corporations a huge tax cut — which has almost entirely been used for higher dividends and stock buybacks, with workers getting essentially nothing.
Aside from the tax cut, however, it’s becoming increasingly clear that Trumpism is bad for business. Or more precisely, it’s bad for productive business.
Imagine yourself as the head of a business that plans and expects to be around for a long time. Sure, you’d like to pay less in taxes and not have to comply with costly regulations. But you also want to invest in your company’s future. And to do that, you need some assurance that the rules of the game will be stable, so that whatever investments you make now aren’t suddenly made worthless by future shifts in policy.
The big complaint business has about Trump’s trade war isn’t just that tariffs raise costs and prices, while foreign retaliation is cutting off access to important markets. It is that businesses can’t make plans when policy zigzags in response to the president’s whims. They don’t want to invest in anything that relies on a global supply chain, because that supply chain might unravel with Trump’s next tweet. But they can’t invest on the assumption that Trump’s tariffs will be permanent, either; you never know when or whether he’ll declare victory and surrender.
Environmental policy, it turns out, is similar. Business leaders aren’t do-gooders, but they are realists. Most of them understand that climate change is happening, that it’s dangerous, and that we’ll eventually have to transition to a low-emissions economy. They want to spend now to secure their place in that future economy; they know that investments that worsen climate change are bound to be long-run losers. But they’ll hold off on investing in our energy future as long as conspiracy theorists who consider global warming a gigantic hoax — and/or vindictive politicians determined to erase Obama’s achievements — keep rewriting the rules.
To be fair, however, some kinds of business do thrive under Trumpism — namely, businesses that aren’t in it for the long run, operations whose strategy is to take the money and run. These are good times for mining companies that rush in to extract whatever they can, leaving a poisoned landscape behind; for real estate speculators sponsoring dubious ventures that take advantage of newly created tax loopholes; for for-profit colleges that leave their students with worthless degrees and crippling debt.
In other words, under Trump it’s springtime for grifters.

Texto completo: Remember when trade wars were “good, and easy to win”? President Donald Trump’s glib declaration has now been replaced by a new one, from his Senate surrogate, Lindsey Graham: Americans should “accept the pain” of Trump’s trade war with China.
That pain is felt largely (though not solely) by farmers – many of whom count themselves among Trump’s base. This president’s arrogance and incompetent handling of trade negotiations has put farmers in a lurch, while threatening the strong economy Trump likes to brag so much about. At this rate, Democrats could discover the 2020 election is “easy to win.”
Contrary to his claims, Trump’s decision to blow up America’s trade relationship with the world’s most populous country wasn’t forced by China’s trade practices. While those practices have been unfair, that’s an issue for the bargaining table, not the front lines of a trade war. Trump made a unilateral decision to start that war, based on his belligerent worldview that life is a zero-sum endeavor: For someone to win, someone else has to lose.
In fact, free trade at its best is a positive for all sides. That was certainly true for America’s farmers, who for years have supplied China with the soybeans and other crops it needs. It’s been a huge, stable market. But stability doesn’t impress this president. He prefers chaos. And now he has it.
Trump last year began imposing tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum, falsely declaring that China would have to “pay” those costs. But tariffs are paid by the importers – generally, American companies, who pass the cost onto American consumers – a fact Trump either didn’t understand or hoped Americans didn’t.
In any case, even as prices of manufactured goods in the U.S. are rising as a result, China’s utterly predictable retaliatory tariffs are devastating American farmers. Total U.S. agricultural exports to China, which stood at $24 billion in 2014, fell to just over $9 billion last year, as those buyers turn to other countries for their crops. There’s a real danger that, once Trump’s trade war is finally over, those new trade relationships will have gelled, leaving U.S. farmers permanently frozen out.
As if to admit how damaging this policy has been, the administration has thrown $28 billion in financial aid at farmers – money American taxpayers also have to foot instead of Chinese markets. Even so, farm bankruptcies are sharply up. No won- der, as The New York Times reports, that farmers at a Minnesota gathering last month roundly booed Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue.
Trade wars aren’t good and, as America’s farmers and consumers are learning, there are generally no winners. Trump’s reelection strategy has been to take credit for economic growth he inherited; voters next year should make sure he also gets “credit” for the trade chaos created entirely on his watch.

Breaking Barriers in Ballet: Misty Copeland Set to Receive Trailblazer Award

Texto completo: Misty Copeland had the world of ballet standing still when she made history as the first Black female principal dancer to the prestigious American Ballet Theatre (ABT) in 2015, just months after becoming the first Black woman to perform the lead role of "Odette/Odile" in ABT's coveted "Swan Lake" in the winter of 2014.
Determined to shatter the glass ceiling of the ballet world, on Sep. 11, the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) will honor Misty Copeland with their esteemed Trailblazer Award during the CBC's annual "Celebration of the Arts" event-an award that Copeland deemed as not only an honor but also a necessity.
"It's so important for other Black dancers to see a possibility, a future for themselves in a world that still doesn't include many other Black ballerinas," Copeland said.
"There's definitely still a glass ceiling in the ballet world," Copeland continued. "There's only one Black principal ballerina in the American Ballet Theatre's almost 80-year history, and a lot of people don't have the understanding that, just because it's been done once, doesn't mean that that problem goes away ... having had a Black president doesn't mean that racism doesn't exist."
"If I didn't have art in my life, I wouldn't be the articulate, confident person I am today. Fields in STEM and the arts are so important and vital ... not every child learns in the same way, and sometimes that missing link is art."
Growing up as the fourth child of six, in underserved areas of Southern California, ending up in San Pedro, California, Copeland spoke to a time when she, her mother and five siblings found themselves all living in a small motel after her mother's marriage to her fourth husband became abusive - both emotionally and physically - to Copeland's mother and all of her children.
Despite the economic and social hardships, Copeland said that she was able to find solace and her voice through the world of dance. At the age of 13, the ballet lessons that she began taking at the local Boys and Girls Club, would eventually allow her to move in with her ballet teacher and her family and eventually prepare her to make history.
"It's been 25 years now that I've been a part of the classical ballet world, and I still have that same fire," Copeland said. "I think, for me, it was initially out of my own need as a 13-year old girl growing up in underprivileged communities, to find structure, something I never had, and dance provided exactly what I needed for that time in my life."
"I represent ballet and every child who needs to see representation, hard work and perseverance," Copeland continued. "What it means to be an underdog and to be mentored, have an amazing support system and represent the American dream."
Since joining American Ballet Theatre in 2001, Copeland has gone on to be inducted into the Boys & Girls Club National Hall of Fame; serve on the President's Council on Fitness, Sports, and Nutrition, under the Obama administration; published three books, including the New York Times Bestselling memoir, "Life in Motion: An Unlikely Ballerina;" secured her own Misty Copeland Signature Collection with Under Armour; and received an honorary doctorate from the University of Hartford. All the while, Copeland has been an ardent believer in reminding others that "representation is important."
"I'm still a Black ballerina and a Black woman in this world and that doesn't just disappear with titles," Copeland said. "The more I use my visibility, my platform, my voice, to continue to speak about diversity, both in front of the scenes and behind them, the more I'll be able to help change the trajectory of dance."
"A lot of underserved areas and youth either don't have the access to dance at all or don't receive quality training, which limits their chances of going further when that time comes," Copeland continued. "My hope is that with my platform, I can continue this conversation to bring about change, to show younger people how to own their power, to embrace who they are, to walk on their own path and to help to be the next generation of representation."

Texto completo: A blind man carried his disabled adult son to safety as Hurricane Dorian tore apart his home in the Bahamas.
Eight people were taking refuge in Brent Lowe's cement home in the Abaco Islands on Sunday when Dorian made landfall, boasting maximum sustained winds of 185 mph and wind gusts up to 220 mph.
As conditions worsened, the group moved to a bathroom and Lowe's son curled up in a bathtub, Lowe told the New York Times.
The situation got dire when the roof tore off and the group decided to take a chance and wade through rough current to the closest home still standing.
Lowe, 49, put his 24-year-old son, who has cerebral palsy and is unable to walk, onto his shoulders and, while holding his neighbor's hand, felt his way to shelter five minutes away.
“It was scary, so scary,” Lowe said.
Lowe and his son stayed at the neighbor's house for a day until a rescue bus picked them up and took to a shelter. Lowe, who worked as a butcher in a fish house until he lost his vision because of diabetes, was evacuated to Nassau on Tuesday night, where he can get the dialysis treatment he requires. He left his son with his sister-in-law in Abaco.
Although the storm has since moved on to the East Coast, Lowe has been unable to find out if his eldest daughter is safe, because of communications getting disrupted by Dorian.
“Right before we had the wind, I spoke with her,” Lowe said. “I wish I could have been able to call and ask somebody, you know, because I really was worried about them. I was worried about everybody.”
As many as 30 people have been reported dead in the Bahamas because of Dorian, and the number is expected to rise. Harrowing stories have begun to emerge, including one from a fisherman named Howard Armstrong, who told CNN that he witnessed his wife drown when storm surge flooded their house.
Even though his home is destroyed, like so many others on some of the northern islands of the Bahamas, Lowe said he wants to remain living in Abaco.
“That’s where my family is. My kids are there, my brothers, my sisters, they’re all there," he said, adding that he is "just wondering where we’re going to live when I go back home, what I’m going to do."

Bret Stephens: What was Iran hiding in Turquz Abad?

Texto completo: Reports from the International Atomic Energy Agency don’t usually make for riveting reading, so you may have missed last Friday’s latest, soporifically headlined “Verification and monitoring in the Islamic Republic of Iran in light of United Nations Security Council resolution 2231 (2015).”
Don’t be fooled. Buried in the report are two oblique sentences hinting at a mystery about which you may soon hear a great deal.
“Ongoing interactions between the Agency and Iran relating to Iran’s implementation of its Safeguards Agreement and Additional Protocol require full and timely cooperation by Iran,” the report says. “The Agency continues to pursue this objective with Iran.”
That’s an exquisite way of saying that Iran is stonewalling the agency. The question is, over what?
Last September, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claimed in his speech to the U.N. General Assembly that Iran had a “secret atomic warehouse for storing massive amounts of equipment and material from Iran’s secret nuclear weapons program.” Those amounts added up to an estimated 300 tons of stuff, including about 30 pounds of radioactive material. He then urged IAEA chief Yukiya Amano to “inspect this atomic warehouse immediately.”
The warehouse, which Iran said was a carpet-cleaning facility, is on the outskirts of Tehran in a village called Turquz Abad. Commercial satellite photography purchased by the Washington-based, nonpartisan Institute for Science and International Security shows the site being gradually emptied of multiple large containers between July and September of 2018, following Israel’s heist earlier that year of a huge cache of Iranian nuclear documents.
As for the IAEA, the agency only got around to inspecting the site earlier this year, long after the suspicious materials had vanished, and Amano died in July. But nuclear inspectors were nonetheless able to detect radioactive particles, corroborating Israeli claims about the purpose of the warehouse. On Monday, The Wall Street Journal reported that Iran is now refusing to answer the agency’s questions about just what material was stored at the warehouse — and, more importantly, where it might be now.
So what’s new?
Some defenders of the 2015 nuclear deal are prone to answer: Not a lot. Traces of radioactive material may be the residue of Iran’s old nuclear-weapons program, which is generally thought to have been shuttered around 2003. Tehran has always been notoriously recalcitrant when it comes to responding to the IAEA. And after the Iraq WMD debacle, it’s wise to avoid drawing stark conclusions from incomplete and possibly false nuclear evidence.
Then again, the history of nuclear inspections has more false negatives than it does false positives, including the agency’s past failures to find Iran’s secret nuclear facilities in Natanz and Arak. Its unwillingness to follow up promptly and effectively on Israel’s allegations about Turquz Abad, along with its reluctance to disclose what it found, inspire little confidence in the quality of its inspections and even less in its willingness to call out cheating.
As for Iran, hiding nuclear materials is a violation of its basic reporting obligations to the IAEA. It’s also further evidence that Tehran was in violation of the nuclear deal from the moment it was signed. “If Iranians aren’t cooperating, it tells you that potentially they are hiding more,” notes the Institute for Science and International Security president, David Albright, adding that the Turquz Abad findings are “a big deal.”
Especially this week. On Wednesday, Iran indicated that it would take further incremental steps to openly breach the nuclear deal, partly as an effort to get Europe to extend an economic lifeline, and partly as an opening gambit in a new round of negotiations with the United States — something Donald Trump keeps saying he’s open to.
That is bound to spark fears in Jerusalem that the administration will pull the same 180-degree policy turn with Iran as it did with North Korea, sharply constraining Israel’s potential military options while negotiations take place. So it’s notable that Netanyahu made a snap decision to meet Thursday with new the U.S. defense secretary, Mark Esper, in London to discuss “Israel’s security needs.”
That could be a political stunt connected to Israel’s upcoming elections. Or it might concern Israel’s expanding bombing campaign against Iranian military targets in Lebanon, Syria and Iraq. Or, more likely, both.
But the question of what Iran might have been storing in that warehouse, where it is now, what else it might be hiding, and what that all suggests about Iran’s “breakout time” — that is, the speed with which it could race to a bomb — is sure to be under discussion. Netanyahu has been thwarted before, both by his own generals and the Obama administration, from conducting a strike on Iran’s nuclear sites. Yet the desire on his part is clearly there, the diplomatic window is still open, and Israel’s air force is more capable now than it was in 2012. Nobody should rule out the possibility of an Israeli surprise.
Many readers of this column, Iran watchers and proliferation experts especially, no doubt fear the possibility. If they’re serious about averting it, they could play a helpful part by demanding more credible inspections and honest reporting from the IAEA, starting with a thorough accounting for what went mysteriously missing from Turquz Abad.

Texto completo: Today is Thursday,
Sept. 5, the 248th day of 2019. There are 117 days left in the year.
On this date:
In 1774, the first Continental Congress assembled in Philadelphia.
In 1882, the nation's first Labor Day was celebrated with a parade in New York.
In 1939, four days after war had broken out in Europe, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued a proclamation declaring U.S. neutrality in the conflict.
In 1972, the Palestinian group Black September attacked the Israeli Olympic delegation at the Munich Games; 11 Israelis, five guerrillas and a police officer were killed in the resulting siege.
In 1975, President Gerald R. Ford escaped an attempt on his life by Lynette "Squeaky" Fromme, a disciple of Charles Manson, in Sacramento, Calif.
In 1984, the space shuttle Discovery ended its inaugural flight as it landed at Edwards Air Force Base in California.
In 1986, four hijackers who had seized a Pan Am jumbo jet on the ground in Karachi, Pakistan, opened fire when the lights inside the plane failed; a total of 20 people were killed before Pakistani commandos stormed the jetliner.
In 1991, the 35th annual Naval Aviation Symposium held by the Tailhook Association opened in Las Vegas. (The gathering was marred by reports that dozens of people, most of them women, were sexually assaulted or otherwise harassed during the meeting.)
In 1997, breaking the royal reticence over the death of Princess Diana, Britain's Queen Elizabeth II delivered a televised address in which she called her former daughter-in-law "a remarkable person." Mother Teresa died in Calcutta, India, at age 87; conductor Sir Georg Solti (johrj SHOL'-tee) died in France at age 84.
In 2017, President Donald Trump announced that he was phasing out the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program protecting young immigrants who were brought to the country illegally, but said he was giving Congress six months to come up with an alternative. (The Supreme Court is expected to decide by June 2020 whether Trump can terminate the program.) Hurricane Irma strengthened to a Category 5 storm as it approached the northeast Caribbean on a path toward the United States.
Ten years ago: Top finance officials from rich and developing countries agreed during a meeting in London to curb hefty bankers' bonuses and maintain stimulus measures such as extra government spending and low interest rates to boost the global economy.
Five years ago: The U.S. and 10 of its key allies, meeting in Wales, agreed that the Islamic State group was a significant threat to NATO countries and that they would take on the militants by squeezing their financial resources and going after them with military might. Ukraine, Russia and Kremlin-backed separatists signed a cease-fire after five months of bloodshed. Former CBS News and CNN correspondent Bruce Morton, 83, died in Washington.
One year ago: The New York Times published an opinion piece from an anonymous senior administration official claiming to be part of an internal "resistance" working to thwart President Donald Trump's "worst inclinations;" Trump responded that if such a "gutless" person exists, "the Times must, for National Security purposes, turn him/her over to the government at once!" At the second day of his confirmation hearing, Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh rejected repeated efforts by Democrats to get him to reveal his views about a president pardoning himself or being forced to testify in a criminal case. Britain charged two men it identified as Russian military intelligence officers with the nerve-agent poisoning of double agent Sergei Skripal. Republican Jon Kyl of Arizona was sworn in to fill the Senate seat left open by the death of John McCain.
Today's Birthdays: Former Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul A. Volcker is 92. Comedian-actor Bob Newhart is 90. Actress-singer Carol Lawrence is 87. Actress Lucille Soong is 84. Former NFL All-Pro quarterback and college football Hall of Famer Billy Kilmer is 80. Actor William Devane is 80. Actor George Lazenby is 80. Actress Raquel Welch is 79.

Texto completo: "These mountains have a particular enchantment for me."
Jan Karon, best-selling author on why she's working in Black Mountain
"The human mind is in itself a world with huge mountains, deep valleys and forests of the unknown," writes John O'Donohue, in his book, "Beauty." It is fitting, then, that a popular novelist would come to roost in Black Mountain, where the terrain matches that of O'Donohue's imagination of the mind.
In fact, it is among the first reasons best-selling author Jan Karon mentions when asked why she is spending more time here.
A Particular Enchantment
"These mountains have a particular enchantment for me," Karon said, from her Black Mountain cottage. "While some mountains further north roll and are low and serene, our mountains stand right up in our faces and you can have conversations with them."
The beloved author, with her undeniable charm, is most famous for a series of 14 novels set in the fictional town of Mitford, now one of the most memorable towns in contemporary fiction. The 1994 inaugural book, "At Home in Mitford," has been reprinted more than 80 times and was nominated three times for an American Booksellers Book of the Year Award.
The Mitford series quickly garnered millions of fans across the globe. In 2014, Mitford fans packed the Ridgecrest auditorium at Karon's first public appearance in Black Mountain for the First International Mitford Homecoming. In addition to the Mitford novels, which have topped the best-seller lists of The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, Karon has authored 12 other books, including some for children and a cookbook spun from dishes served in Mitford.
The small-town girl born on a humble farm outside Hudson, has quietly bought, renovated and meticulously decorated a small home in Black Mountain. But she has strong ties to Virginia, particularly the Charlottesville area.
Virginia bestowed upon her one of its most prestigious literary honors, a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Library of Virginia. Other authors receiving the award have been Tom Wolfe, Rita Dove, and Edgar Allan Poe. Hundreds of boxes of Karon's business and personal papers, videocassettes and audiocassettes are archived at the University of Virginia in its Special Collections.
More Mitford Than Mitford?
The primary reason Karon landed here is to enjoy time with her daughter and only child, Candace Freeland, who relocated from Hawaii to Black Mountain several years ago. Freeland is a musician, composer and award-winning photographer who took the cover photos for three of her mother's novels, "Somewhere Safe With Somebody Good," "Come Rain or Come Shine," and "To Be Where You Are."
It wasn't long before Karon began to experience the small town charm that Black Mountain is known for. One of the defining characteristics of a community is a sense of connection, and that is precisely what the novelist-at-rest finds nourishing about her new neighborhood.
Neighbors who will let you know when a bear is loping down the street, who smile and wave as they stroll by, this is Black Mountain.
Initially, some of the New York City literary critics complained that the town Karon created was unrealistic, that the people were too good, too nice. But she stood firm and kept writing about the people of Mitford. Her answer to naysayers is simply: "That's because you haven't lived in small town."
"In many ways, Black Mountain exceeds some of the ambitions I had for Mitford," Karon said. "I have been welcomed with affection, love and the kind of friendliness that I wasn't sure still existed."
Karon Event to Benefit the Library
She learned to read when she was 5, and although the local library was too far to walk to, Karon later developed a healthy dependency on libraries. We can thank one of our nation's founders, Ben Franklin, for our library system, initiated in concept when he proposed to his friends that they pool their books all in the same place and come together to read them "which would be nearly as beneficial as if each owned the whole."
When Karon was approached by folks at the Black Mountain Library to give a talk as a fundraiser, she accepted enthusiastically.
Tickets are sold out for her upcoming event in Blue Ridge Assembly, fittingly called "At Home in Black Mountain." Proceeds from the Sunday, Oct. 6 event will help the library achieve a larger vision, said Gwyn Ridenhour, the head of Friends of The Library.
"We are in a new era with the library, which is such a literary and cultural cornerstone of our town," Ridenhour said. She credits branch manager Melisa Pressley with expanding programming, improving the collection, and enhancing the facility. "The October event not only raises supplemental funds for our branch, it also ties the library to a unique and meaningful community program," Ridenhour said.
Aging with Balance and Grace
Now in her 80s, relaxing in Black Mountain is part of a well-deserved break in Karon's constant production of novels. She still travels frequently, for business and pleasure, but is increasingly spending more time here.
Karon's millions of fans pay rapt attention to her Facebook page, where recent posts from her iPad include photos of her office and a musing about being "raised on livermush."
She is an unapologetic Southerner and woman of great faith. Online, and in public speaking events here and there, Karon remains a font of unbounded encouragement and a wisdom borne from a lifetime of keenly observing the people and places around her.
Time will tell if the village-like nature of Black Mountain can romance the mind of this novelist for the long term.
"I am exploring how to live out my life with balance and grace," Karon said.
"These mountains have a particular enchantment for me."

Texto completo: LONDON -- In July, the author Xiaolu Guo was expecting the delivery of a book that would not be published until September: Margaret Atwood's "The Testaments," the highly anticipated follow-up to "The Handmaid's Tale."
Guo was getting her copy so early because she is a judge for this year's Booker Prize, Britain's most prestigious literary award. There was just one problem, Guo said in an interview on Tuesday: When the courier turned up, she was late getting home from the airport. The courier refused to give the book to her brother and sister-in-law, who were visiting from China.
[ Read our review of "The Testaments." ]
Guo missed the courier's visit the next day, too, as she was out running errands. By the time she finally got the book, she was furious, she said.
"For me, it was quite over the top, the whole security issue," Guo added, laughing.
The secrecy around Atwood's new novel, which is on the Booker Prize shortlist that was announced this week, has complicated the judging process this year. The prize's organizer had to sign a nondisclosure agreement on behalf of all the judges, said Peter Florence, the chairman of the judging panel.
Secrecy agreements were not required for the 150 other novels that judges read to create an initial list of books in the running that was announced at the end of July. They then reread and argued over those thirteen titles to choose the final six.
At the shortlist announcement on Tuesday, all six books were piled on a table in front of the judges, among them Salman Rushdie's "Quichotte" and Lucy Ellmann's "Ducks, Newburyport." But the copy of "The Testaments" was actually a dummy.
"That's not the real Atwood, by the way, in case anyone's thinking of stealing it," Gaby Wood, the prize's literary director, told reporters.
The judges must reread the shortlisted novels one more time before choosing the winner that is to be announced Oct. 14.
Joanna MacGregor, a pianist who is on the judging panel, said the prize's organizers had sent "endless emails" about "The Testaments," "telling us what not to do."
Each judge was hand delivered a watermarked copy. Florence said he had received his at his home "way up in the Welsh mountains."
"It took a courier about a day to get there," he added.
MacGregor said a courier had arrived at her hotel in Melbourne, Australia, when she out playing a concert. "He waited for me for hours in the lobby," she added.
When the judges opened their packages, each found a stack of unbound copy paper. Each judge's name had been printed across every page in large gray letters. It made the book slightly difficult to read, Guo said.
"I think we all felt, 'This is such a rigmarole, it better be worth it,"' MacGregor said. "And then of course when we opened it: 'Oh, yeah, it was worth it."'
Not everyone went to such lengths to maintain the book's strict embargo. On Wednesday, some readers in Australia who had pre-ordered "The Testaments" on Amazon said on social media that they had received it early. With the cat out of the bag, The Sydney Morning Herald and other newspapers decided to publish extracts from the book earlier than originally agreed.
"The Testaments" is set 15 years after the events of "The Handmaid's Tale" and in the same place: Gilead, the religious autocracy where women are stripped of their rights and many are kept in sexual slavery.
The sequel "is a kind of spy thriller about a mole inside Gilead" working to bring down the evil empire, Michiko Kakutani wrote in her review of the novel for The New York Times. "Atwood's sheer assurance as a storyteller makes for a fast, immersive narrative that's as propulsive as it is melodramatic," she added.
Afua Hirsch, a broadcaster and another Booker judge, said in a telephone interview that the hardest thing about judging "The Testaments" was not the secrecy, but the fact that it's a sequel. "What I find quite difficult is Atwood created a world -- this incredibly brilliant, original dystopia -- and she did that in the first book," Hirsch said. "How much does this book stand alone in terms of what it offers that's new?"
She said she didn't know the answer yet, only that it was a "brilliant book" that spoke to today's political climate.
Hirsch said that she had considered shredding her copy after the judging was complete, but came to realize that doing so would be a mistake. She said she had heard that Atwood changed the book after the judges received it, so those copies would be "very valuable."
She joked that it was her retirement plan. "It's actually quite crumpled, but it's all there," she said.
Two other people who had a brush with the manuscript were less convinced it was a gold mine: Guo's brother and sister-in-law. When she finally received the book in July, she jokingly told them not to try to sell it. "If I ever see this in China ..." she said, in a reference to pirated copies.
Who was this author everyone was making such a fuss about, they asked? Guo told them.
They said they had never heard of her.

Under Pressure From China, Cathay Pacific Chief Resigns

Texto completo: HONG KONG -- The chairman of Cathay Pacific Airways said on Wednesday that he would resign, making him the second top executive of the embattled Hong Kong carrier to step down since protests began roiling the city.
In a filing Wednesday afternoon with Hong Kong's stock exchange, the airline said that the executive, John Slosar, would resign as chairman and as an executive director in November. He will be replaced by Patrick Healy, 53, a longtime executive at John Swire & Sons (H.K.) Limited, the holding company that controls the airline.
Cathay characterized the planned resignation of Mr. Slosar, 63, as a retirement. Less than three weeks earlier, Rupert Hogg departed as the airline's chief executive.
Mr. Slosar could not be reached for comment. In a memo to employees viewed by The New York Times, he described the recent weeks as the "most extraordinary and challenging times" the airline had experienced.
"I can well appreciate that such volatility can cause concern over what the future may hold," he wrote, but added that the airline had always been subject to business and geopolitical pressures.
"Each time we have faced challenging times, we have emerged stronger than ever before," the memo read. "And I do believe this will be the case once again, so have confidence."
The company's difficulties stem from the demonstrations that have shaken Hong Kong since June. Beijing is seeking to bring Hong Kong's business community to its side, with intense criticism of companies by state media and the suggestion that they could lose access to China's dynamic economy if they do not fall in line.
Cathay Pacific is particularly vulnerable to pressure from the mainland. Chinese destinations account for a significant amount of its revenue. It also counts Air China, a state-run airline, as a minority shareholder.
The demonstrations began in opposition to a proposed law that would allow Hong Kong, which has its own judicial system, to extradite people accused of crimes to mainland China, where the Communist Party controls the courts. Clashes between demonstrators and the police have grown increasingly violent has the protests have dragged on.
Cathay has come under intense scrutiny by Chinese officials, who want to bring the protests to a halt. One of its pilots was arrested during a demonstration, and the airline began an investigation after the flight information for a Hong Kong police soccer team was leaked.
Previously, Mr. Slosar had said the political views of employees were not the airline's business. "We certainly wouldn't dream of telling them what they have to think about something," he said at a news conference. "They're all adults. They're all service professionals. We respect them greatly."
In response, Chinese regulators demanded last month that Cathay workers who participated in the demonstrations be barred from flying to mainland China. It has also demanded lists of employees who fly to China or through its airspace.
Cathay since forbade its employees to engage in protests that the Hong Kong authorities consider illegal. Unions have accused the airline's management of being too tough with its workers, including with its firing of the chairwoman of a flight attendants' union after she shared pro-demonstration material on her Facebook account.
Cathay has declined to comment on individual employees but said that "it takes into account all relevant factors" when dismissing employees and stays within the limits of both the law and employment contracts.
It is not clear how long the scrutiny will last. On Wednesday, Carrie Lam, Hong Kong's top leader, said she would withdraw the extradition bill. Cathay's shares jumped by more than 5 percent on Wednesday after media reports that the withdrawal was coming.
But the protests have broadened to include demands for universal suffrage and an independent inquiry into police conduct, and opposition lawmakers and others involved with the protests said Ms. Lam would have to meet their other demands to stop the unrest.
That unrest is beginning to take a toll on Cathay's traffic. The company has said it expects a hit to its revenue in August and later.
Mr. Slosar, who has worked for Swire and its related companies for 39 years, has been a top executive at Cathay Pacific for more than a decade. He became its chief executive in 2011, then its chairman in 2014. The airline prospered initially under his leadership as Asia's economic growth took off, but the airline has been pressured in recent years by the rise of budget carriers.
Mr. Healy, the new chairman, has worked at Swire for 31 years and is currently managing director of Swire Coca-Cola, its beverage distribution arm.

Elites abandon norms and show contempt for voters on both sides of the Atlantic

Texto completo: Wars by the elites on the people are flaring in English-speaking nations on both sides of the Atlantic. It’s being waged fiercely in Westminster Palace’s House of Commons and also in the House of Lords — and in the newsrooms and green rooms of American journalism as well.
You could argue it’s the subject, open or veiled, of almost all recent British and American opinion journalism. But what I find most interesting is that the same elites who proclaim themselves the guardians of accepted mores and norms of civility have been freely, and self-righteously, abandoning those very mores and norms without a hint of embarrassment.
Consider what’s been happening in Westminster. Some 21 MPs elected as Conservatives voted against Prime Minister Boris Johnson and effectively placed control of the agenda in the hands of the leftist anti-Semitic Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. That goes against the long-established norm of voting with your party.
They were able to do so only because the House Speaker, John Bercow, abandoned longstanding precedent to allow such a vote, making it clear he did so to undermine Johnson’s policy on Brexit. That goes against the long-established norm that the British speaker (unlike the speaker here) is politically neutral and follows precedent, whatever the political effect.
The issue that divides Johnson and the large majority of Conservative MPs from the party rebels and the speaker (who was originally elected to Parliament as a Conservative himself) is, of course, Brexit.
British voters in June 2016, more than three years ago, voted to leave rather than remain in the European Union. Turnout was huge; discussion was thorough, and dominated by the pro-"Remain" leaders of all parties and the pro-"Remain" BBC. Nonetheless, some 52% of British voters voted for leave — a larger number than have ever voted for any party in the nation’s history.
Yet, Britain hasn’t left yet, for reasons set out by Christopher Caldwell in the Claremont Review of Books. Johnson’s feckless predecessor, Theresa May, made unilateral concessions to EU negotiators, guided by pro-remain career civil servants. The Commons rejected her agreements three times by nearly 2-to-1. She effectively abandoned the alternative that Britain would leave without a deal, reverting to WTO trade rules.
Johnson has said he’ll negotiate with the EU but, absent an agreement, will leave on the Oct. 31 date which Parliament voted and revised the parliamentary schedule to facilitate that.
Remainers in Parliament and the press attacked his determination to carry out voters’ solemn verdict as “undemocratic.” Some called for a “unity” government, as if a position rejected by voters could forge unity. They routinely dismissed "Leave" voters as ignorant, bigoted, or manipulated by campaign trickery. The two lead editorials in the pro-"Remain" Economist incongruously lament voters’ cynicism and yet urge overturning voters’ Brexit verdict.
Contempt for voters as ignorant and bigoted unites English-speaking elites on both sides of the Atlantic. Here it is apparent, or lightly disguised, in New York Times Executive Editor Dean Baquet’s remarks at a newsroom meeting of reporters and editors last month.
The precipitating event seems to have been a Times headline reading “Trump urges unity vs. racism.” This accurate description of a presidential speech inspired Twitter rage from readers and Democratic politicians and was dropped for one with an anti-Trump hit, “Assailing hate but not guns.” So much for the norm of journalistic objectivity.
Baquet also reflected on the Times’ coverage of the Trump presidency. “Chapter One of the story of Donald Trump, not only for our newsroom but, frankly, for our readers was: Did Donald Trump have untoward relationships with the Russians, and was there obstruction of justice?” But then, “the day Bob Mueller walked off that witness stand,” he went on, “our readers who want Donald Trump to go away suddenly thought, ‘Holy [expletive], Bob Mueller is not going to do it.”
One of the hallmarks of a great journalist is an instinct for stories that are going to pan out; by his own account, Baquet and the Times lacked it utterly for two years. So, what’s the paper’s new number one story? “[t]o write more deeply about the country, race and other divisions.” Hence the Times’ 1619 Project. The news hook is the arrival of slaves in Virginia 400 years ago, with articles repeatedly asserting the centrality of racism in America ever since, in everything from the lack of universal healthcare to the routes of the freeways in Atlanta.
In other words, having failed to oust Trump on Russia, the Times will try to discredit the elected president, his policies, and his voters as racists. Contempt.

Bill de Blasio puts potential end date on his 2020 campaign

Texto completo: New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio could end his 2020 presidential campaign by Oct. 1.
The candidate said Wednesday there would be little reason to continue his long shot bid for the White House if he failed to qualify for the fourth Democratic debate in October.
“I think the logical thing to say is I’m going to go and try and make the October debates and if I can, that’s a good reason to keep going forward, and if I can’t, I think it’s really tough to conceive of continuing,” de Blasio said, according to the New York Times.
De Blasio did not make the third debate, happening next week, after qualifying for the first two this summer.
Candidates need to meet polling and campaign contribution thresholds determined by the Democratic National Committee by Oct. 1 to make that month’s debate. The criteria are: 130,000 unique donors, with 400 donors per state in at least 20 states, and at least 2% support in four national polls or in the first four states to hold their primaries or caucuses.
The Sept. 12 debate had the same requirements.
De Blasio, 58, has struggled to gain traction in the polls, having less than 1% support, according to a RealClearPolitics average of national data.

Texto completo: The American right in the Trump era has a racism problem. It’s fed by a Republican president who race-baits, a media ecosystem whose guardrails have collapsed, the lure of far-right ideas after various center-right failures and the influence of toxic forms of internet community on impressionable minds.
At the same time, the American right in the Trump era faces a liberalism that’s eager to discover and condemn racism where it does not actually exist. Positions that any de-Trumpified conservatism would necessarily hold are conflated with white nationalism, figures who opposed Donald Trump are hammered as enablers of racism, and progressives indulge a political fantasy in which the racist infiltration of the mainstream right is an opportunity to delegitimize conservatism entirely.
The coexistence of these two realities was usefully illustrated in the last two weeks. If you want evidence that bigotry on the right is a bottom-up problem as well as a feature of the president’s birtherism and Twitter wars, just read last week’s SplinterNews exposé on the email group where a cluster of youthful and not-so-youthful right-wingers gathered to play at white nationalism while holding down normal jobs for conservative publications and institutions. What was reported in the piece I can confirm anecdotally: Every extended conversation I have with 20-something conservatives includes a discussion of how to deal with racist flirtations in their peer group.
But if you want evidence that unjust delegimitization is happening as well, consider that in the very same period that the email exposé appeared, a succession of mainstream media outlets served up bogus accusations of racism against prominent and not-so-prominent conservatives.
First Rachel Maddow’s show ran a segment accusing a judicial nominee for the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Steven Menashi (an old friend, full disclosure), of highbrow white supremacy for a 2010 law review essay arguing that Israel’s status as a Jewish homeland is normal rather than dangerously illiberal, because liberal democracies the world over often have similar ethnic identities and foundations. (The Maddow segment neither mentioned that Menashi is Jewish nor that Israel was his primary subject.)
Then The Washington Post published an op-ed attacking J.D. Vance, the author of “Hillbilly Elegy” (also my friend, full disclosure), as a racist for a speech in which he worried about America’s plunging birthrate. In that case The Post had to run a correction, not least because one of the Vance speeches cited in the essay specifically attacked Republicans for being insufficiently sympathetic to ... African-American single mothers.
Then a couple of days later The Post published a peculiar essay by Eve Fairbanks, a usually judicious liberal writer, accusing a group of mostly anti-Trump conservatives and centrists (including, full disclosure, my colleague Bari Weiss) of somehow adopting the rhetoric of Confederates and slaveholders when they argue that left-wing orthodoxies in the intelligentsia are oppressively stifling debate.
And then, just Tuesday morning, Bloomberg Law published a hit piece on an obscure Labor Department appointee, Leif Olson (fullest disclosure: I had never heard of him before), which alleged that he had posted anti-Semitic conspiracy theories on Facebook. Olson was forced to resign before it became apparent that the post in question was mocking white supremacists and anti-Semites, the reporter having apparently failed to recognize crushingly obvious sarcasm in his haste to criticize.

Texto completo: Islamabad, Pakistan • After I was elected prime minister of Pakistan last August, one of my foremost priorities was to work for lasting and just peace in South Asia. India and Pakistan, despite our difficult history, confront similar challenges of poverty, unemployment and climate change, especially the threat of melting glaciers and scarcity of water for hundreds of millions of our citizens.
I wanted to normalize relations with India through trade and by settling the Kashmir dispute, the foremost impediment to the normalization of relations between us.
On July 26, 2018, in my first televised address to Pakistan after winning the elections, I stated we wanted peace with India and if it took one step forward, we would take two steps. After that, a meeting between our two foreign ministers was arranged on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly session in September 2018, but India canceled the meeting. That September I also wrote my first of three letters to Prime Minister Narendra Modi calling for dialogue and peace.
Unfortunately, all my efforts to start a dialogue for peace were rebuffed by India. Initially, we assumed that Mr. Modi’s increasingly hard-line positions and his rhetoric against Pakistan were aimed to whip up a nationalist frenzy among the Indian voters with an eye on the Indian elections in May.
On Feb. 14, a few months before those elections, a young Kashmiri man carried out a suicide attack against Indian troops in Indian-occupied Kashmir. The Indian government promptly blamed Pakistan.
We asked for evidence, but Mr. Modi sent Indian Air Force fighter planes across the border to Pakistan. Our Air Force brought down an Indian plane and captured the pilot. We struck back to signal we could defend ourselves but chose not to strike a target that would cause loss of life. I made a conscious decision to show that Pakistan had no intent of aggravating the conflict between two nuclear-armed states. We returned the captured Indian pilot, with no preconditions.
On May 23, after Mr. Modi’s re-election, I congratulated him and hoped we could work for “peace, progress and prosperity in South Asia.” In June, I sent another letter to Mr. Modi offering dialogue to work toward peace. Again, India chose not to respond. And we found out that while I was making peace overtures, India had been lobbying to get Pakistan placed on the “blacklist” at the intergovernmental Financial Action Task Force, which could lead to severe economic sanctions and push us toward bankruptcy.
Evidently Mr. Modi had mistaken our desire for peace in a nuclear neighborhood as appeasement. We were not simply up against a hostile government. We were up against a “New India,” which is governed by leaders and a party that are the products of the Hindu supremacist mother ship, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, or the R.S.S.
The Indian prime minister and several ministers of his government continue to be members of the R.S.S., whose founding fathers expressed their admiration for Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler. Mr. Modi has writtenwith great love and reverence about M.S. Golwalkar, the second supreme leader of the R.S.S., and has referred to Mr. Golwakar as “Pujiniya Shri Guruji (Guru Worthy of Worship).”
Mr. Modi’s guru wrote admiringly about the Final Solution in “We, Our Nationhood Defined,” his 1939 book: “To keep up the purity of the race and its culture, Germany shocked the world by her purging the country of the Semitic Races — the Jews. National pride at its highest has been manifested here. Germany has also shown how well-nigh impossible it is for races and cultures, having differences going to the root, to be assimilated into one united whole, a good lesson for us in Hindustan for us to learn and profit by.”
I had hoped that being elected prime minister might lead Mr. Modi to cast aside his old ways as the chief minister of the Indian state of Gujarat, when he gained global notoriety for the 2002 pogrom against local Muslims on his watch and was denied a visa to travel to the United States under its International Religious Freedom Act — a list of visa denials that included associates of Slobodan Milosevic.
Mr. Modi’s first term as prime minister had been marked by lynching of Muslims, Christians and Dalits by extremist Hindu mobs. In Indian-occupied Kashmir, we have witnessed increased state violence against defiant Kashmiris. Pellet-firing shotguns were introduced and aimed at the eyes of young Kashmiri protesters, blinding hundreds.
On Aug. 5, in its most brazen and egregious move, Mr. Modi’s government altered the status of Indian-occupied Kashmir through the revocation of Article 370 and 35A of the Indian Constitution. The move is illegal under the Constitution of India, but more important, it is a violation of the United Nations Security Council resolutions on Kashmir and the Shimla Agreement between India and Pakistan.
And Mr. Modi’s “New India” chose to do this by imposing a military curfew in Kashmir, imprisoning its population in their homes and cutting off their phone, internet and television connections, rendering them without news of the world or their loved ones. The siege was followed by a purge: Thousands of Kashmiris have been arrested and thrown into prisons across India. A blood bath is feared in Kashmir when the curfew is lifted. Already, Kashmiris coming out in defiance of the curfew are being shot and killed.

From Madison Square Garden to Jack London Park, dancer steps past disability

Texto completo: Evan Ruggiero can’t wait to perform in this weekend’s “Gala Celebration” on the outdoor stage at Jack London State Historic Park, and he’s not shy about the one thing that people tend to notice about him first.
“You’ll hear me sing. You’ll see me dance. And you can’t miss me. I’m the guy with one leg,” he said.
This man was born to dance and nothing will stop him.
Ruggiero, 28, now a New Yorker, began dancing at the age 5, and at 10, he was accepted into the famed New Jersey Tap Ensemble, but at age 19, during his sophomore year at Montclair State University, he was diagnosed with osteosarcoma, a rare bone cancer, in his right leg. After nine surgeries attempting to save the leg, it was finally amputated. He underwent 16 months of chemotherapy, and ultimately, 18 months after the surgery, and just two days after being fitted with the prosthetic he calls his “peg leg,” he was tap dancing again.
And not just dancing, but progressing and performing professionally. In 2013, he got his bachelor of fine arts degree in musicalW theater from Montclair in New Jersey.
“I didn’t feel like the door was closed,” he recalled. “I always thought I’d keep going to auditions and trying out for shows.”
In 2014, he was cast in his first professional theater job with Transcendence Theatre Company, presenter of the “Broadway Under the Stars” concert series at Jack London State Historic Park in Glen Ellen, and he has returned to perform there several times since then.
In 2018 in New York, Ruggiero received a Drama Desk nomination for best actor in a musical, another nomination for the Chita Rivera Award for best dancer in a musical, and was awarded a Clive Barnes Award in Theatre, all for his portrayal of Tom Jones in the 2017 Off-Broadway production of “Bastard Jones,” based on the 1749 Henry Fielding novel “Tom Jones.”
“We had total inclusion and diversity in the cast and company for that show — black, white, Asian, Hispanic, disabled and transgender, and we put all of that into a cast of 10,” Ruggiero said. “We got a lot of press, and a good review from the New York Times.”
And earlier this year, the dancer performed alongside Grammy Award-winning singer, songwriter and actor Jason Mraz at a special VIP event preceding the singer’s Madison Square Garden show in New York.
During one of his visits to Transcendence in Sonoma two years ago, Ruggiero participated in the company’s after-school program at the Boys & Girls clubs in Sonoma Valley.
“I always love working with kids because they’re so open and honest,” he said. “They ask me, ‘What happened to your leg?’ They call me Iron Man and Robotman.”
A one-legged tap dancer is bound to attract attention, and Ruggiero accepts that gracefully, but makes it clear in all show business relationships that he’s a professional artist, not an oddity.
“I don’t want to be treated as a novelty,” he explained. “If I feel like I’m getting those vibes, I’d probably decide to put my time and energy elsewhere. As an actor in the disabled community, I try to talk about inclusion with producers and directors.”
If You Go
What: “Gala Celebration”
When: preshow picnicking at 5 p.m., show at 7:30 p.m. Friday through Saturday, Sept. 6-8
Where: Jack London State Historic Park, 2400 London Ranch Road, Glen Ellen
Admission: $49-$144
Information: 877-424-1414, extension 1; transcendencetheatre.org
Never confining himself solely to tap, Ruggiero has a broad training in dance, but some styles work better for him now than others.
“I did tap, jazz, ballet and modern. I was a dance competition kid growing up, and I was well-rounded,” he said. “I didn’t do hip hop, and I probably wouldn’t want to do that now. I was called for a ballet audition, and it wasn’t great, so I probably won’t be doing that.”
Like athletes, dancers strive to keep their bodies fit and young, and in Ruggiero’s case, the process is complicated.
“I feel a little weathered,” he said. “The chemo knocked me out for a while at first. Some days, I feel closer to 40. So, I got into physical therapy, chiropractic and massage, to try to focus on my overall health.”
When he dances, Ruggiero uses his “peg leg,” a fairly simple metal prosthetic, but for everyday life, including such tasks as climbing stairs, he wears a more complicated model, outfitted with microcomputers and sensors, he said.
He can do some things that most dancers can’t: “I can spin my leg in circles.”
Ruggiero reports that audiences are on his side wherever he goes.
“The audiences always really life me up, and the responses are different around the world,” he said. “In Egypt, I got to perform for the president of Egypt and he was serious and dignified, but everyone else was losing their minds. In Germany, the audience was more reserved, but in Mexico, they went wild.”
Having come this far, the dancer sees no reason to stop now.
“I have the kind of personality and desire to try everything,” he said. “My goal would be to perform on Broadway. That would be the ultimate.”

Texto completo: The College of DuPage Fine Arts program, in collaboration with the Cleve Carney Museum of Art, welcomes six artists to campus for lectures and workshops as part of the 2019-2020 Visiting Artist Series.
All lectures are free and open to the public and take place in either the Playhouse Theatre or Belushi Performance Hall of the McAninch Arts Center, located on the Glen Ellyn campus, 425 Fawell Blvd.
In its fifth year, the Visiting Artist Series provides opportunities for the community to engage with leaders in the fields of contemporary art, design and culture.
This year’s series highlights artists who are committed to engaging with materiality through diverse mediums and practices.
The Visiting Artists Series begins at 1 p.m. Thursday, Sept. 18, with a lecture by messenger, artist and educator Nick Cave in Belushi Performance Hall.
Cave, described as a Renaissance artist, works between the visual and performing arts through a wide range of mediums, including sculpture, installation, video, sound and performance. His solo exhibitions have expanded globally from the United States through France, Africa, Denmark, Asia, South America and the Caribbean.
Cave is most famous for creating "Soundsuits," sculptural costumes enveloping the wearer’s body in everyday objects. "Soundsuits" camouflage the body, masking and creating a second skin that conceals race, gender and class, forcing the viewer to look without judgment.
Cave also works as a professor at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.
Multidisciplinary artist Mie Kongo discusses how her work is driven by a sense of curiosity, discovery, realization and learning through everyday life at 11 a.m. Tuesday, Oct. 22, in Belushi Performance Hall.
Kongo creates multidisciplinary work with diverse materials, including ceramic sculptures, installations and porcelain designed objects. Her work has been exhibited nationally and internationally, including recent exhibitions at the Arts and Literature Laboratory in Madison, Wis., 4th Ward Project Space in Chicago, Grunwald Gallery of Art at Indiana University Bloomington and the Hyde Park Art Center in Chicago.
Her residencies include Shigaraki Ceramics Cultural Center in Japan, the European Ceramic Work Centre in the Netherlands and Intonation Deidesheim in Germany. She is an adjunct associate professor in the ceramics department at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.
Artist Aden Kumler shares her extensive knowledge of medieval art history at 11 a.m. Wednesday, Nov. 20, in Belushi Performance Hall. Kumler is an associate professor in the departments of Art History and Romance Languages and Literatures at the University of Chicago and an affiliated faculty member of the University of Chicago’s Medieval Studies program, Center for the Study of Gender & Sexuality and Divinity School. She is the co-editor of the International Center of Medieval Art’s "Viewpoints" book series, a new forum for experimental books on medieval art history, co-published by the International Center of Medieval Art and Penn State University Press.
Installation artist Paola Cabal discusses the intersection between physics and perception at 11 a.m. Thursday, Feb. 20, in the Playhouse Theatre. Cabal is best known for her rigorous observational studies of daylight over time—movements the artist photographs on-site, then paints directly into spaces trompe l’oeil-style using spray paint. As an artist and educator, Cabal co-teaches a course called "Articulating Time and Space" alongside astrophysicist Kathryn Schaffer at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Cabal has received a fellowship from the Illinois Arts Council, an Individual Artist award from the Richard H. Driehaus Foundation, a joint commission for the Chicago Transit Authority and the Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events, and a residency at the Chicago Cultural Center.
Visual artist Mary Mattingly discusses her work that explores issues of sustainability, climate change and displacement at 1 p.m. Wednesday, March 18, in Belushi Performance Hall. Based in New York, Mattingly creates photographs, sculptures and large-scale public art projects addressing climate change by drawing connections between the social and economic forces that make up the current political ecology impacting our environment. In 2016, she launched a floating food forest on a barge called "Swale," a social sculpture where people are invited to pick food from an edible landscape in order to circumvent public land laws in New York City that disallow public foraging. Mattingly recently transplanted a group of edible palm trees to upstate New York to show that the introduced vegetation accounts for predictions in climatological shifts. Mattingly’s artwork has been featured in The New York Times, Le Monde, New Yorker and The Wall Street Journal as well as on CBS, BBC, NBC and PBS’s Art21.
Chicago-based architect, Vladimir Radutny closes out the series with a discussion about his architecture studio’s belief that architecture is an art form at 11 a.m. Wednesday, April 8, in the Playhouse Theatre. In 2008, Radutny founded his Chicago-based architecture and design studio. Radutny’s multi-disciplinary architecture practice focuses on innovative design solutions that challenge the conventional interpretations of space, function and material use. His studio’s approach is ideas-driven, relying on imagination and experience to identify the creative nuances within each project. He believes in architecture as an art form with capacity to not just alter space, but to change perceptions, feelings and habits, transcending the workplace, home or in-between. His practice has been recognized with numerous AIA design awards and, in 2017, Radutny was awarded the Dubin Family Young Architect Award. In addition, he teaches at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and the Illinois Institute of Technology College of Architecture.

Texto completo: The woman who was dubbed “Emily Doe" in the sexual assault case involving Stanford University swimmer Brock Turner has revealed her full identity in a forthcoming memoir that will be released this month.
Chanel Miller, who was in her early 20s at the time of the January 2015 assault, has come forward to share her story in a new 368-page book, titled “Know My Name," which will be released Sept. 24. She also sat for an interview with CBS's “60 Minutes," which will air on Sept. 22.
According to her author profile on Penguin Random House's website, Miller “is a writer and artist who received her BA in Literature from the College of Creative Studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara." She lives in San Francisco, according to her profile.
Miller's case gained national attention after she read a heart-wrenching 7,200-word victim impact statement in court during Turner's trial in 2016. She began the statement by saying, “You don't know me, but you've been inside me, and that's why we're here today."
She continued to explain her ordeal in the statement, adding, "You took away my worth, my privacy, my energy, my time, my intimacy, my confidence, my own voice, until today."
Prosecutors said that Turner assaulted Miller while she was unconscious behind a dumpster on campus. Turner was caught by two passersby, described by Miller in her statement as Swedish graduate students.
“When the policeman arrived and interviewed the evil Swede who tackled you, he was crying so hard he couldn't speak because of what he'd seen," she wrote in her statement.

Turner was convicted in 2016 on three felony charges: sexual assault of an unconscious person, sexual assault of an intoxicated person, and sexual assault with intent to commit rape. He was sentenced to six months in jail — a sentence that was widely criticized as too lenient. He served three months of that sentence, according to The New York Times.
The judge in the case, Aaron Persky, was recalled as a result of the ensuing uproar.
It has been known that “Emily Doe" was writing a memoir, but it wasn't previously clear if she would reveal her identity.
Miller — then known only as “Emily Doe" — was named Glamour's “Woman of the Year" in 2016, as her statement, the magazine said, was a "take-no-prisoners" account that "changed the conversation about sexual assault forever."
Then-Vice President Joe Biden also penned an open letter to her published online, calling her a “warrior" and saying he was “in awe of your courage for speaking out."
"I do not know your name — but your words are forever seared on my soul." Biden also wrote that her statement should be required reading.
“The millions who have been touched by your story will never forget you," he wrote.

Texto completo: The dishonest fakers at the Amazon Washington Post and the failing New York Times are again attacking your favorite president, this time for playing golf while a Category 5 hurricane took aim at the United States.
Bad people! Everybody knows the best way to prepare for a hurricane is by playing golf.
Beating a Category 5 is nothing if you can birdie a par five (the 590-yard 12th hole on Trump National Golf Club's Championship Course is "monstrous"). Though recent hurricanes have been some of "the wettest we've ever seen, from the standpoint of water," they are less intimidating after you've survived the eighth hole of the Riverview Course: not one but two merciless water hazards blocking your approach.
Hurricanes are best weathered from bunkers, and you can bet Trump spent time in those this weekend with his sand wedge. Think high winds are a threat during hurricanes? They're even more hazardous to your handicap; it wouldn't surprise me if, in true emergencies, Trump has resorted to a 2-iron to reduce loft. And not even a meteorologist studies rotation as closely as a golfer; just one slice and all models project you'll make landfall in the deep rough.
Essentially, Trump was on the fairways doing exactly what we'd want our president to be do during a natural disaster - with a few minor revisions:
The president canceled a trip to Poland for the 80th anniversary of the start of World War II, allowing him to give his undivided attention to Hurricane Dorian play rounds of golf both Saturday and Monday at Trump National Golf Club in Virginia.
In his place, he sent the vice president to Europe to renew the enduring transatlantic bond stay at the Trump International Golf Links and Hotel in Doonbeg, Ireland. The president also delivered a somber message chipper greeting to Poles on the anniversary of the Nazi invasion, recalling the death and suffering of millions of Poles saying: "I just want to congratulate Poland."
At a briefing before last year's hurricane season, the president honed a sophisticated knowledge of tropical storms spoke aimlessly about catapults on aircraft carriers. Three other Category 5 storms had already occurred during his presidency, which meant that he was well-prepared to respond to such a storm didn't stop him on Sunday from declaring, again, that "I'm not sure I've ever even heard of a Category 5."
His director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency and his secretary of homeland security were both seasoned veterans serving in temporary, "acting" capacities, and his head of the Coast Guard provided him storm updates packed with sophisticated government data that "you can pretty much get . . . on television."
On Friday, when the National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane watch for the Bahamas, the president announced that he would spare no expense in aiding relief efforts "the top shows on @FoxNews and cable ratings are those that are Fair (or great) to your favorite President, me!" He expressed confidence that Florida Mar-a-Lago could withstand the storm. After learning during an intelligence briefing Friday that Iran had an unsuccessful rocket launch, the president coordinated a response with allies trolled Iran by including in a tweet an image that may have revealed covert U.S. activities.
On Saturday, when the hurricane center warned of Dorian's "life-threatening storm surge and devastating winds," the president spent the day overseeing emergency preparations attacking former FBI director James Comey, celebrating his success on "The Apprentice," responding to a now-former aide's claim that he disapproves of his daughter's weight ("I love Tiffany, doing great!") and playing golf. The president had said he would "not have time to play golf in office" has played 213 rounds of golf while in office.
On Sunday, the president, asked about the deteriorating situation in Colombia, appealed for restraint by leftist FARC guerrillas replied: "You're talking about the country of Colombia?" Following a FEMA briefing on the now "catastrophic" and intensifying Dorian, the president reinforced official warnings unilaterally declared that Alabama, where no storm damage was forecast, would also "most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated."
On Monday, as storm warnings widened, the president spent hours on the phone with emergency management officials playing golf again and checking on pre-positioning of relief supplies attacking the AFL-CIO chief, economist Paul Krugman, the "Fake News Media" and four nonwhite congresswomen.
On Tuesday, the hurricane center said Dorian would soon "move dangerously close" to Florida, then Georgia and the Carolinas; the president prayerfully summoned the nation's resolve attacked the Federal Reserve, the mayor of London, former president Barack Obama and "the whole Witch Hunt against me."
And, all across this great land, Americans rallied to the cause wondered: Do hurricanes give mulligans?

Prosecutors hammer Democratic lawyer Craig on Ukraine work

Texto completo: Prominent Democratic attorney Gregory B. Craig blackened his own reputation by scheming with Paul Manafort to work for the Ukrainian government without registering with the Justice Department as a foreign agent and lied to investigators to conceal contacts with the New York Times meant to benefit their client, federal prosecutors said Tuesday.
In closing arguments at Craig's federal trial in Washington, prosecutors hammered the former White House counsel as motivated by greed and self-protection, spurred by Manafort's promise of seven-figure annual billings.
Ukraine hired Craig for his "sterling reputation" to bolster its battered image in the West, and Craig lied to Justice officials about the nature of his work because "his reputation would have been tarnished if the truth that had come out," Assistant U.S. Attorney Fernando Campoamor-Sanchez told jurors. "But now the truth has come out."
"No matter how many great things he has done in this country, no one is above the law in this country," he went on. "The truth matters. Facts matter. And now that you have heard the evidence, it is time for you to hold this man accountable for that scheme, and that truth, and find him guilty as charged."
Craig, 74, has pleaded not guilty to a felony count of making false statements to officials investigating whether he and his law firm, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, should have registered as foreign lobbyists for writing a 2012 report reviewing the jailing of Yulia Tymoshenko, a political rival to Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych. Manafort was a political adviser to Yanukovych.
Craig, who advised Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, was indicted in April. Before his trial, U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson dropped what had been a second count against him of submitting a false or misleading report under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, saying it was unclear whether the act applied in the circumstances.
In the defense's closing, Craig attorney William J. Murphy implored jurors to scrutinize the law and a 2013 letter from Craig to the Justice Department explaining to investigators that Craig had his own reasons to speak to the Times, namely to defend himself, his firm's and his colleagues' work, and that he was not paid for his media outreach.
Government allegations that Craig was part of Ukraine's media rollout of the report relied on the words of a "congenital liar," Murphy said, naming Manafort deputy Rick Gates, who testified and awaits sentencing after cooperating in Mueller's probe and as a witness against Craig and Manafort.
Murphy said Craig was truthful in saying that in responding to the Times, Craig did not inform or consult with Ukraine or act as its agent. Murphy spoke of the reputation Craig had built over 50 years and urged jurors to "salvage" it for him, saying, "We ask you to apply the evidence with the law and find him not guilty and prevent this prosecution from sounding a horrible, false note at the end of an incredible career of honor, service and integrity."
The three-week trial has turned on why Craig communicated with the Times journalist David Sanger on Dec. 11, 2012.
Craig's position, as laid out in trial, is that he made contact only to correct mischaracterizations being promoted by Ukraine that Skadden's report exonerated its treatment of Tymoshenko. Prosecutors contend that Craig hand-delivered the report to the journalist's home two days before it was released because, Craig wrote Sanger in an email, Ukraine had determined it wanted the Times to have it first as part of a planned media campaign.
The charge of making false statements carries up to a five-year prison sentence, but federal guidelines for a first offender include probation.
The case involving Craig, the first prominent Democrat charged in an investigation spun off from special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's Russia probe, is set to go to a jury Wednesday.
Craig's prosecution has placed an exclamation point on Washington's crackdown on foreign lobbyists under FARA, a long-dormant law that requires Americans to disclose when they are paid to influence U.S. policy for foreign governments, political parties or politicians.
The law was the basis of charges against nearly two dozen defendants investigated by Mueller, compared with seven federal prosecutions in the previous five decades.
A conviction in the case would tarnish the career of Craig, who retired last year from Skadden as one of the most respected Democratic lawyers in Washington.
An acquittal could raise anew questions about the adequacy of U.S. laws meant to bring transparency to the work of American lawyers, lobbyists and publicists employed by foreign governments to influence U.S. policy and public opinion.
"Ladies and gentlemen, this is why FARA matters," Campoamor-Sanchez told jurors, saying that if Craig had been required to register, "the facts would have come out" sooner of Manafort's decade-long undisclosed work for Ukraine, including $4.15 million that he had Ukrainian oligarch Viktor Pinchuk secretly pay Skadden to represent Ukraine.
Prosecutors have alleged that at Manafort's request, Craig backdated a $1.25 million invoice to the Ukrainian government to conceal Pinchuk's payments and to further a cover story that the Ukraine government was spending only $12,000 for Skadden's services. "That tells you a lot about his honesty, integrity and his willingness to do what Ukraine wanted done," Campoamor-Sanchez said.
Skadden in January reached a settlement with the Justice Department, admitting it should have registered for its work in 2012 and 2013, and agreed to turn over $4.6 million it made for the report in exchange for facing no criminal charges. In its settlement, Skadden agreed that an initial finding by the Justice Department in 2014 that the firm did not need to register came after the agency relied on "false and misleading oral and written statements" made by Craig.

Trump is ramping up anti-media campaign

Texto completo: President Trump requires no translation or interpretation when it comes to his plan for going after national news outlets as Campaign 2020 kicks into high gear.
On Monday, he made his intentions clear in a couple of rambling, overcapitalized tweets: "Our real opponent is not the Democrats, or the dwindling number of Republicans that lost their way and got left behind."
No, he wrote, "our primary opponent is the Fake News Media." This was attached to a rant about what he calls the "LameStream Media" and its supposed lack of sources and fact-checking: "They are now beyond Fake, they are Corrupt."
Attacking the reality-based media is nothing new for Trump. That strategy was a mainstay of his 2016 campaign and has endured, like a chronic disease, throughout his presidency.
But now that his reelection bid is, arguably, in trouble, he is ramping it up.
In recent weeks, he has called the media "crazed," charged that it is in a "sick partnership" with the radical left and said journalists are trying to create an economic recession. And a group of conservative operatives tied to the White House is digging up dirt about journalists to discredit news organizations.
As New York Times White House correspondent Maggie Haberman noted in response to the Labor Day tweets: "A Trump adviser . . . said weeks ago that the president, whose own approval ratings have stayed upside down, needs voters to feel negatively not just about his opponents but about longstanding institutions."
Should journalists quake? Should truth-minded citizens cower?
With a little help from some recent Gallup poll numbers on trust in the media, I'll make a few predictions:
First, Trump's tactic will work - but almost exclusively with the people who are already convinced that the national news media shouldn't be trusted, namely Republicans.
Here are the five news sources that Republicans trust most: local TV news, discussions with family and friends, Fox News Channel, local radio news and local newspapers.
By contrast, these Republicans deeply distrusted national newspapers, CNN and the nightly broadcast news - Trump's major targets.
So, in general, Republicans already have crossed over to the no-trust zone - with one predictable exception.
Nearly 7 in 10 of them trust Fox News - whose opinion and talk shows, at least, often amount to state TV for the Trump administration.
For Democrats and independent respondents, those low-ranked news sources soar much higher.
Independents favor public television news, and show far more trust than Republicans in other national news sources. Democrats generally show trust in national newspapers and the nightly news on ABC, CBS and NBC.
And both independents and Democrats look askance at Fox News, with fewer than 2 in 5 respondents finding it trustworthy.
The split, in other words, couldn't be much sharper. And I would wager that there's little that Trump can do over the next weeks and months to widen that gaping divide.
Gallup examines results over a 20-year period. These trends didn't appear with Trump, and they won't go away with him.
Second, there is a significant loser in the trust battle over that long time period: CNN. Trust in the network decreased sharply - from 64 percent to 48 percent who consider it trustworthy. (Despite this, CNN remains, overall, more trustworthy than Fox News among all groups.)
Republicans diss CNN with a 20 percent trust rating. Independents give it 48 percent. Only Democrats give it a high trust rating, at 72 percent.
Again, this is not merely the Trump effect.
The changing view of CNN since the late 1990s surely reflects the growing partisanship of American politics overall. And is partly a result of the increasing dominance on cable of Fox News, which moguls Rupert Murdoch and Roger Ailes set up for the very purpose of fostering mistrust in the mainstream media - and taking financial advantage of the resulting divide.
A milder version of this same trend is true for the network news and probably for much the same reason.
Still, Trump's attacks on the news media are ugly and destructive. They deepen partisanship. They erode the bedrock democratic idea that there is a common set of facts underlying our politics.
Granted, media outlets are far from perfect. Mainstream journalists make mistakes, and need to do a better job of owning them and improving their record of fairness and accuracy.
But for the most part, they get the facts right and strive - sometimes to a fault - for neutrality and balance. We need journalists and news organizations to continue to do their jobs, and do them better than ever.
And so, my third takeaway: Trump's attacks on news outlets won't make much difference to the media industry itself or individual journalists.
The trends are already firmly in place. The choir has already been thoroughly preached to, and is ready to sing.
But the president's ramped-up rhetoric will do damage nonetheless by further dividing a torn-apart nation.
It's going to be a long 14 months.

Texto completo: Headnote ESSAY
Daughter loves the
Dollar Store.
Last spring, we camped in the Sonoran Desert for our kids' spring break, bathing in the sunshine after record winter snowfall in our Colorado hometown and savoring the "superbloom," a fireworks display of wildly abundant spring flowers. Waterfalls of silky orange poppies cascaded down hillsides. Purple lupine lined the roads. By dusk, the intense heat slipped away along with the daylight. Bats swooped over our campsite as the sky became a starry darkness. It was my kind of vacation.
My children felt differently. One afternoon, we drove on the outskirts of Tucson through a promenade of big-box stores. My 12-year-old daughter, Rosie, funneled all her energy into spotting the Dollar Tree amid the squared hulking buildings with their distinctive logos, more recognizable to most Americans than their regional flora and fauna. This was my daughter's kind of vacation.
As we blurred past storefronts, a familiar despair washed over me. I long for my children to find value and intrigue in the natural world rather than in unrestrained consumerism. It's hard for me to separate their lust for the next landfill-bound fad from my failure to imprint my conservation values on their developing minds. When this mixes with my worry about the demise of the planet, it can make for troubling parent-child relations. "Do you think everything at the Dollar Tree actually costs a dollar?" Rosie asked, concern tightening her voice. "Because if not, maybe we should look for Dollar General or Family Dollar." Like my own captivation with desert plants - spiny and waxy and extravagantly orange - Rosie was taking note of the subtle variations on a theme "Hey - what about the 98 cent store?" she asked, a new species calling to her.
I swallowed my sermon on how clever, well-funded marketers have sold her a lie that the next new shiny thing will bring her happiness and how the longing for pleasure delivered through single-serving stuff is actually killing our planet. These are not popular messages among the backseat contingent. We had spent the morning hiking in Romero Canyon, northwest of Tucson, gossiping about saguaros: which had the most arms, the tallest trunk, the most classic storybook look. We delighted in bright cardinals and their cartoonishly chunky red beaks. The sun cranked up the heat. Lizards darted. My 14-year-old son challenged us with logic riddles.
I announced how much fun we were all having, like a salesperson trying to sell the kids on something - the wonders of quick-moving birds and slow-moving cacti. They could smell my fear: If this blooming desert won't stand up to their world, beckoning them with unlimited entertainment and the lure of perky YouTubers peddling merch, we were, as a species, in very big trouble.
A friend recently said to me, speaking about adolescents: "They're questioning everything. That's their job." I get it: If it is my voice railing against retail therapy, that will become the easy target against which they will necessarily rebel. As when Rosie says, "Hey, World Market looks interesting!" and her father replies, "How about the actual world; that could be interesting, too." Now the mental space available for outrage is directed toward her father, rather than the corporations that convince us we are hopelessly deficient without their products.
I would like nature to be a salve, a refuge, a teacher for my kids, as it was for me as a young adult investigating my own cultural conditioning. At the same time, I don't want to shame my children for wanting what they want. I believe that if they get to taste all the flavors of consumerism - the joy and heartache - they will find their own wisdom.
We located the Dollar Tree, and Rosie exploded from the car, clutching $16.1 found her in line behind a man gathering 100 toiletries. "For the homeless," he explained. He returned multiple times, arms loaded with toothbrushes, shampoo and other items that help confer human dignity. The part of me that wanted to point fingers at some villain had to lower my hand and reconsider. Rosie and I were stilled by his kindness but also by his cheery resolve. I detected no inner tension, not about the copious plastic bags, nor the dubious "scents" in the scented deodorant. Life was more complex than I'd made it out to be.
Rosie paid for her 16 items; I covered the tax. "Just one bag, please," she requested.
Back at camp, we set off in the waning light for Romero Creek. A rabbit paused in the shadows. The saguaros were, inexplicably, just as we left them; I had crossed through 10 emotions and back again.
At the creek, Dan and the kids conducted a stick race downstream. A Gila woodpecker called from the top story of a saguaro. The kids were barefoot and laughing, cheering on their stick-boats as the sun cashed out on another day. "This is so fun!" Rosie shrieked. I felt the utter relief of not having to sell them on anything, of simply letting the experience of unstructured joy in nature imprint its hopeful message on them. If the kids are in the business of questioning everything, I hope they found one small answer in this moment.?

Texto completo: THE WEST
"A patrol car was struck by a falling bear in Northern California ... causing the vehicle to crash and explode." News stories rarely begin this way, but it certainly is an opening guaranteed to catch the reader's attention. The Associated Press explained that the bear apparently either jumped" or fell onto the car from a steep embankment. No doubt this was a bear of considerable girth, because it smashed the hood and windshield, causing the patrol car to crash into the embankment, roll onto its side and "burst into flames." Somehow the Humboldt County deputy escaped without serious injury, but the car was gutted and about half an acre of hillside caught fire and burned. As for the bear? "Don't worry," a spokesperson for the California Transportation Department; it "fled the scene."
THE WEST
Pop quiz: What part of a bison can you safely touch in Yellowstone National Park, or in any other park, for that matter? "No part, and don't even think it!" has been the Park Service's answer for decades, yet tourists can't seem to resist a fortuitous fondle. Thanks to a widely circulated video of a bison flinging a young girl into the air after a group of kids got too close, we know that the animals have little patience with rude humans. Yet a man who left the boardwalk at Yellowstone this August to pet a bison on the head managed to escape without being gored. So how does the Park Service get its safety message across? The agency recently distributed a schematic drawing of a bison, carefully but humorously delineating the consequences should you venture too close. What happens if you touch a bison's nether regions, for example? The Park Service simply replies: "Do you have insurance?" Poking the chest of a bison leads to a blunt "Vacation over." Yet given human nature, we fear one warning might prove counterproductive. Asking people "How fast are you?" before they touch a bison's head might just tempt competitive types, dying to find out.
WASHINGTON
If you read the Seattle Times, you've probably noticed that real estate dominates the news, as young people are priced out of a drum-tight market, and ho-hum houses sell for a million or more. Meanwhile, Seattle struggles with what the paper calls the "surreptitious and unregulated universe" of rundown recreational vehicles lining some city streets. The RVs, which rent cheaply but are in sorry shape, will soon be towed away, said Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan, who called their owners "the worst of slumlords." Yet the tent colonies set up by the homeless in front of buildings are no solution either. Some "authorized encampment areas" have been turned into tiny-house villages, but until Seattle has enough services and housing, Durkan said, "I can't guarantee that we'll ever have a place where there are no tents."
THE BORDER
It lasted for half an hour, but it was a lovely sight: Three pink seesaws were inserted between the steel slats of the border wall that divides Mexico from the United States, and as U.S. Border Patrol agents and Mexican soldiers watched, children on both sides bobbed up and down, united in fun. On the U.S. side, the happy event was held in Sunland Park, New Mexico, population 14,500. The "Teeter-Totter Wall" was created
by Ronald Rael, an architecture professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and Virginia San Fratello, an associate professor of architecture at San Jose State University. Their earlier works include a "Burrito Wall" that allows a food cart to be inserted between the slats, as well as a "Wildlife Wall" with gaps permitting wildlife to pass freely between the two countries. Only a few months ago, though, Sunland Park's wall made darker news. In April, members of a right-wing militia took it upon themselves to forcibly detain migrants there. Then, in May, a group collecting private donations for a border wall erected its first section of fencing on private land in the city, reported The New York Times. Sunland Park Mayor Javier Perea praised the shared playground, saying that it showed that "people live along the border and get along pretty well with each other despite the wall."
WYOMING
Paul Beau pre, a doctor and CEO of St. John's Medical Center in Jackson, Wyoming, wasn't climbing a mountain or even out golfing when lightning struck him this July: He was walking toward his car across a parking lot at the Jackson Hole Airport. Waking up after being "face-planted on the asphalt," Beaupre said later that he simply went on home, figuring that the lightning hadn't killed him, "and I would see how it went." The answer was "not well." At the hospital where he works, Beaupre later learned he had a broken nose and jaw and three broken ribs. But at least he hadn't suffered a heart attack, reports the Jackson Hole News&Guide, "which is a common occurrence after being struck by lightning." The National Weather Service recommends taking shelter if a storm is within 3 miles, adding ominously that even on a clear day, lightning "can travel up to 15 miles from a storm."

Texto completo: Albuquerque has been selected to be part of the “United for the Future” national tour by Peter Buffett, Emmy Award-winning musician, composer, author and youngest son of investor Warren Buffett.
He will perform in Albuquerque on Sept. 26 as part of the tour of United Ways and their communities.
Hosted by United Way of Central New Mexico, the event will provide an opportunity for business, community and young leaders in attendance to discuss how to best build communities that come together around their most challenging issues.
Buffett will offer his perspective in a live musical setting while using his own life story and experiences as illustration.
The “Concert & Conversation,” held at the University of New Mexico's Keller Hall, is by invitation only.
Sponsorships with tickets attached are also being sold as a fundraiser for the United Way of Central New Mexico. Supporting sponsorships cost $2 500 and include two tickets; contributing sponsorships are $5,000 and include four tickets; and presenting sponsorships cost $10,000 and include 6 tickets. All sponsors get their name published in the program. To purchase sponsorships, call United Way of Central New Mexico at 505-247-3671.
As part of his visit, Buffett will learn about the local United Way's Mission: Graduate and Mission: Families initiatives.
“We are honored that Peter will lead a discussion in our community about what it means to Live United,” said Rodney Prunty, president and CEO of United Way of Central New Mexico. “This will inspire us to consider how our commitment to inclusion and equity informs the many paths that will move our communities forward.”
Buffett, who like his father is a philanthropist, runs the NoVo Foundation in partnership with his wife, Jennifer Buffett. The mission statement of NoVo is “to foster a transformation from a world of domination and exploitation to one of collaboration and partnership.”
According to Buffett, “it is one's values and what we are able to give back to society that shape and define us as individuals.”
Among NoVo's initiatives are advancing adolescent girls' rights; ending violence against girls and women; advancing social and emotional learning; supporting thriving local communities; and supporting indigenous communities in North America.
Buffett is the author of “Life is What You Make It,” originally published in 2010 and debuted on the New York Times Best Seller Hardcover Advice list. The book is a companion to his live “Concert & Conversations” performances.

Texto completo: A commercial dive boat with 39 passengers and crew members aboard was engulfed in flames early Monday and sunk hours later near the Santa Cruz Island shoreline off the Ventura County coast. By late Monday, authorities confirmed that 25 people died in the ordeal, with several others still unaccounted for, the Associated Press reported.
FIve of the boat’s six crew members were rescued.
By midday Monday, authorities had confirmed that four victims were found dead near the 75-foot vessel Conception, which departed Saturday from Santa Barbara Harbor for a Labor Day holiday weekend excursion. Later in the day, crews discovered four more bodies on the ocean floor near the wreckage of the vessel, Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said.
The AP reported that, by late Monday, the Coast Guard had confirmed that at least 25 people had died.
Torrance resident says ‘divine intervention’ kept him off deadly dive boat
What sparked the horrific fire, which was first reported to the Coast Guard via a frantic mayday call around 3:30 a.m., wasn’t immediately known.
“Our hearts go out to the families of the victims of this terrible tragedy,” Brown said at a somber news conference. “We understand the tremendous burden they are under right now as they wait to determine exactly what happened. We will be working diligently to get them as much information as possible as soon as possible.”
Authorities were continuing to search into the evening for more of the 33 passengers unaccounted for after flames tore through boat. The Conception also carried six crew members, five of whom were rescued after fleeing the burning craft, officials said.
“We will continue to search but we should be prepared for the worst outcome,” U.S. Coast Guard Capt. Monica Rochester said.
Firefighters responded to the blaze shortly before 3:30 a.m., about 90 miles from Los Angeles. Coast Guard Sector Los Angeles-Long Beach overheard a mayday call about 15 minutes earlier of a commercial vessel with 39 people aboard.
By the time crews arrived shortly after the mayday call, the boat was fully engulfed in flames with little anyone could do to save it, said Mark Hartwig, Santa Barbara County’s fire chief.
Crews from the Coast Guard, Santa Barbara Fire Department, Ventura County Fire Department and Vessel Assist responded. The fire crews were fighting the blaze when the vessel sank 20 yards off shore in 64 feet of water, officials said.
Authorities said that initial four recovered bodies had injuries consistent with drowning, according to The Associated Press.
Five of the boat’s crew members were rescued by a nearby boat.
“The crew was actually already awake and on the bridge and they jumped off,” Rochester told reporters at a news conference at the Channel Islands Harbor.
They were evacuated on to a good Samaritan’s boat, Grape Escape, the Coast Guard said. Two of the crew members had minor injuries, said Coast Guard Petty Officer Mark Barney.
“When we looked out, the other boat was totally engulfed in flames, from stem to stern,” Grape Escape owner Bob Hansen told The New York Times. “I could see the fire coming through holes on the side of the boat. There were these explosions every few beats. You can’t prepare yourself for that. It was horrendous.”
As the morning turned to afternoon, family members of the missing passengers trickled in to the Coast Guard station in Oxnard in search of answers.
Sheriff Brown told reporters that the passengers would have be identified through DNA, depending on the condition of their remains.
A woman who came to the harbor early Monday said, “My son was on that boat.” She was led away by a Ventura County firefighter.
At around 8:30 a.m. the vessel had a portion of the bow sticking out of the water, authorities said.
Rochester said that the missing passengers were sleeping below deck at the time of the fire. She said authorities were working with the owners of the boat which had been in “full compliance” prior to its trip departure.
Rochester said rescuers would continue searching through the night.
“This isn’t a day that we wanted to wake up to,” she said at the afternoon news conference.
Several photos on social media posted by the fire agencies showed the Santa Barbara Harbor-based vessel completely overtaken by flames.
According to the Worldwide Diving Adventures website, the boat was on its last day of a three-day diving excursion that started in Santa Barbara Harbor. The Labor Day weekend trip, which started Aug. 31, gave passengers the opportunity to see marine life and explore San Miguel Island, according to the website.
The Conception had departed at 4 a.m. Saturday with plans to return Monday.
The boat was launched in 1981 and had a 46-person capacity, according to its profile on the website of Truth Aquatics, the Santa Barbara company that owns the ship. It had rafts and life jackets for 110 passengers and a fixed CO2 engine room for fire suppression.
Divers sleep in a single room of bunk beds, according to a diagram of the Conception posted on the website.
Thomas Kruger, director of scuba operations at Dive N’ Surf in Redondo Beach, said the boat and the operator had a good reputation.
Dive N’ Surf has booked charters on the Conception and other dive boats operated by Truth Aquatics, but not for at least a year mainly because of the distance, he said.
“This has been way out of left field,” Kruger said in an interview Monday. “The boat has been a phenomenally good boat that was meticulously kept. There was nothing anytime they were diving that would have indicated an event like this.”
Dive boats of that size are typically inspected by the U.S. Coast Guard about once per year, Kruger said. Operators also generally perform regular checks of fire extinguishers and other safety devices whenever the boat goes out, he said.
“Having a boat of that caliber there is a lot that goes into maintaining those boats and the systems on them,” Kruger said.
The event had a major effect on the close-knit diving community. Calls have been coming in inquiring whether anyone local was on board, Kruger said. As of Monday afternoon, the identities of the victims had not been released and Kruger did not know if any local divers were on board.
“We are sending out our prayers and our hopes that we get some better news by the end of the day,” he said.
Dale Sheckler, a Torrance man who is an experienced diver, had planned on spending Labor Day weekend aboard the Conception, but a hip surgery sidelined those plans.
“I feel frightened and relieved at the same time,” Sheckler said. “I’m also sick about the lives that were lost. I’m upset about it. My heart goes out to them.”
Sheckler said he’s been on the Conception several times before, but hasn’t been on the vessel in well over a year.
“I think considering the fact that the crew lost one of their members, I think that people need to understand that the crew was probably unable to assist those in distress,” he said.
Members of the diving community also expressed their grief on social media. Many shared their thoughts on the Truth Aquatics Facebook page, some recounting their own diving experiences.

Others showed photos of the vessel’s sleeping area, pondering if passengers could have escaped.
Most, like Kruger, offered their condolences and prayers.
Sprinkled into the comments were those who questioned why members of the crew may have been the only ones to survive. That sentiment was addressed by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who Monday afternoon called for an “immediate and robust” investigation.
“It’s inconceivable that with all the safety regulations we have in place today, a fire on a boat can lead to the loss of life we saw this morning near Santa Cruz Island,” Feinstein said in a statement.
“We must know what fire-suppression systems and other emergency equipment are in place on these boats and whether they were in working order on the Conception. And we need to understand exactly how the crew was trained and, if they were awake and above-deck, why they were unable to alert or help rescue passengers.”
The Channel Islands National Park Service said that the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Department, Santa Barbara County Fire Department, United States Coast Guard are working with it as a unified command.
A one-mile safety zone was established around the perimeter of the incident while search-and-rescue efforts continue, officials said. A 3,000-foot flight restriction was also temporarily placed around the ship.
Authorities have established a Family Assistance Center at the Earl Warren Showgrounds, 3400 Calle Real, Santa Barbara, which is expected to remain open through Thursday. Information via phone is available from the Santa Barbara County Office of Emergency Management at 833-688-5551.

Texto completo: AUSTIN, Tex. -- In 2018, two weeks before Lara Prescott's agents sent publishers the manuscript of her first novel -- about the C.I.A. plot to influence Cold War Russia with the banned love story "Doctor Zhivago" -- a famous male writer warned her, "You're not going to get anything for this. You need to edit it like Hemingway. We can talk about it over beers."
"The Secrets We Kept," a gorgeous and romantic feast of a novel anchored by a cast of indelible secretaries -- some groomed to be secret agents, and all clacking away at covert C.I.A. documents on mint-green typewriters -- promptly sold to Knopf at auction for $ 2 million.
"I'd say that was the most man-splainy thing that's happened to me in the writing world!" says Prescott, 37, with a laugh over coffee at the Austin cafe where she finished her first draft in 2016. Such a display of masculine bombast reminded her of her former career in politics, where she worked as a consultant on K Street for progressive Democratic campaigns. Her experience in a world fueled by propaganda and lorded over by big personalities -- "What would make a 60-year-old man think it O.K. to ask a young woman why I didn't wear heels more?" -- informed her book.
[ "The Secrets We Kept" is one of our most anticipated September titles. ]
The years of embedding in campaigns, writing candidates' social media and stump speeches, left Prescott drained and disillusioned. She'd forever wanted to write fiction, dating back to a child when she submitted a 10-page story to Highlights magazine, the pediatrician-office staple. ("My first literary rejection!") You could say she was born to write this historical novel: Prescott's mother named her after the doomed heroine from her favorite movie, the 1965 adaptation of Boris Pasternak's epic.
Prescott was turned down the first year she applied to graduate schools. "I just thought, I don't have it," she says. But the following year she was accepted at the Michener Center for Writers at the University of Texas. There, early in her tenure, the fellows were treated to a day of mini-pitch sessions with literary agents. After reading a short-story version of what Prescott would eventually expand into her novel, a high-profile agent warned her, "No one is interested in Russia anymore." Prescott left the room flattened, wondering, "Do I keep going?"
She dug in for four private drafts, done with sharing work until she was sure of its sturdiness. In early 2017, she finally presented the novel to her Michener thesis adviser, the author Elizabeth McCracken, who remembers thinking, "Oh my God, this book is going to do amazing things in the world."
A year of revisions later, Prescott's agent, Jeff Kleinman at Folio, sent the manuscript out to publishers packaged with advance praise from McCracken, Bret Anthony Johnston and Ben Fountain. Kleinman asked Prescott what would be a satisfying deal. She told him $ 100,000, figuring that would give her three years to write full-time at the roughly $ 27,000 a year she'd been granted while at Michener. By the end of the week she'd spoken with 20 editors, her novel had gone to auction and she went with Knopf, which wasn't even the highest bidder. She walked away from a two-book option, unwilling to work in the future with a gun to her head.
A deal that sweet can set a young writer up to fail. The money and expectations, the paranoia of peer envy or eye rolling. "I've had students that I thought were great writers before where I would go, 'Is this success going to destroy this person's life?"' says McCracken. "I'm not worried about Lara."
She praises Prescott's work ethic and devotion to the craft. "But also, frankly, I think she's going to earn out her advance. She's not going to be somebody who sold her book for a ton of money and then is going to be a commercial failure and wreck the rest of her career." Rights to the novel have sold in 30 countries, and it was optioned in a major movie sale by Marc Platt Productions and The Ink Factory.
[ Read: "The 'Doctor Zhivago' Nobel Dust-up." ]
Prescott has the slightly worried personality of a woman who went to 12 years of Catholic school and was raised by Pennsylvania parents who cautioned against taking oneself too seriously. She's game to indulge in casting ideas with a reporter -- what about Saoirse Ronan for the unlikely spy Irina or Michelle Williams for Pasternak's long-suffering muse, Olga -- without sounding invested in Hollywood machinations. She pokes fun at her self-serious expression in her author photo, explaining that when she fake-smiles for pictures she looks insane. She tears up a few times, like when she describes calling her parents with news of the Knopf deal. "I had this great career in politics and then I took this huge pay cut to go back to school," she says. "And my poor dad said, 'I'm just happy you're going to be O.K."'
With the sale of the book, Prescott seems to have built sensibly upon an already cheerful life. She and her husband Matt -- who works for the Humane Society of the United States and recently published his own book, "Food Is the Solution" -- bought their first home, a three-bedroom midcentury ranch with a pink and turquoise tiled bathroom and a writing shed in the backyard. They have two cats and a rescue puppy named Mo, and their close friends live down the block with a new baby they like to snuggle. Prescott is in a book club (they last discussed Toni Morrison's "Sula"). There is comfort in living far from the publishing industry.
"I'm not going out to cocktail parties every night," she says of her somewhat anonymous Texas existence. "There's no sense of competition."
Prescott is eager to pick the right rabbit hole to fall into for her next project. She's already started researching the Federal Writers' Project, the Depression-era program that paid literary greats like Zora Neale Hurston and John Cheever to go out looking for American tales. She's fascinated by the world of fake news -- who writes it, and why and how it spreads. She'd love to chronicle her dream candidate Elizabeth Warren on the campaign trail if she were to get the nomination.
There's also the reality that she's now being sent advance copies of books hopeful for a blurb from a famous writer. Her! It'd be easy to let this flush of a time go to one's head. But there's a difference between ego and self-possession. When asked what she's proudest of in all this, Prescott says, "I wrote a book that I would love to read. And that my sister and mom would want to read. What more can you do?"

Texto completo: Almost a year later, we still don't know.
Outside of a tiny circle of insiders, no one knows who wrote the instantly viral op-ed column about President Trump that appeared in the New York Times last Sept. 5. Despite an informal White House investigation, plenty of outside sleuthing and a whole Internet's worth of guessing, his or her identity remains unknown.
The column - "I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration" - set social media aflame and cable chat shows ablabber with speculation about who the "senior official" behind it could be.
Kellyanne Conway? Mike Pompeo? Nikki Haley? Mike Pence? In the year since publication, dozens of names have been floated. All have denied it, sometimes ostentatiously. No one has stepped forward or conclusively been shown to be the author.
History suggests this cannot last. Others who started out as anonymous in high-profile cases have eventually been revealed.
The sensation surrounding the Times op-ed writer began almost instantly upon publication of the 900-word column. The article described in general terms efforts by White House staffers, including the author, to thwart Trump's "amorality" and "impulsiveness," which had resulted, according to the writer, "in half-baked, ill-informed and occasionally reckless decisions that have to be walked back."
The most outraged reaction came, perhaps predictably, from Trump himself. "If the GUTLESS anonymous person does indeed exist, the Times must, for National Security purposes, turn him/her over to government at once!" he demanded in a tweet a few hours after the column was published. Trump never explained what aspect of national security was imperiled by the unflattering column. Nevertheless, he thundered: "TREASON?"
Prompted by the president's pique, the White House conducted a brief hunt for the writer. Aides reportedly compiled a list of suspects. There was talk of administering lie-detector tests or seeking sworn statements, though nothing seems to have come of it.
Then-White House press secretary Sarah Sanders tried a novel approach: She posted the Times's main phone number on Twitter, and she urged people who "want to know" the identity of "this gutless loser" to call and ask the paper's editors for his or her name. The phone campaign did not work, either; some people called the Times to praise it for running the column.
The Times's editors said they took the rare step of shielding the writer's identity to protect him or her from "reprisals" - which, judging by Trump's explosion, seemed like a possibility. They said they verified the person's identity through direct contact with the author and the "testimony" of an equally anonymous "trusted intermediary" who brokered the article to the newspaper.
In the year since, the op-ed itself has largely been forgotten, new sensations and scandals burying it daily like the sediment of successive civilizations. But questions remain: Is the author still working in the administration? What policies or initiatives did she or he actually thwart, if any?
And, of course, the big one: Whodunnit?
The fact that Anonymous remains anonymous seems like more than just a loose end. In an age of oversharing and TMI, it is tantamount to a small miracle of restraint and discretion.
To date, only five people know - or are known to know - the identity of the author. They are Times publisher A.G. Sulzberger; editorial page editor James Bennet; op-ed editor James Dao; the "intermediary;" and the author him/herself. (The list of those who presumably don't know includes the journalists in the Times's newsroom, among whom are some of the finest investigative reporters in the world.)
It is possible that someone inside the administration knows, too, thanks to a clue the author dropped in the op-ed. The writer quoted "a top official" who complained to him or her about a meeting in the Oval Office in which Trump changed his mind about "a major policy decision." The author quoted this official as saying, "There is literally no telling whether he might change his mind from one minute to the next."
Bennet and Dao declined requests for an interview for this story. In a statement, however, Bennet wrote: "As we said a year ago, this op-ed offered a significant first-person perspective that had not yet been presented to Times readers, describing the efforts made by some inside to carry out policies they believed in while containing what they saw as the president's troubling impulses. The substance of that piece has been borne out by reporting at The Times and elsewhere over the past year."
Journalists protect sources regularly, but Anonymous isn't just any old source. In the few instances in which there was public curiosity about an anonymous source or writer, the person's identity eventually became known.
Watergate's Deep Throat, for example, outed himself after more than 30 years. The anonymous terrorist known as the Unabomber provided one clue too many and was unmasked in 1996. The unidentified author of the best-selling political novel "Primary Colors" was eventually exposed, too.
The Unabomber anonymously sent 16 mail bombs to various targets between 1978 and 1995, killing three people and injuring 23. Despite a massive FBI manhunt, the man later arrested and convicted of the crimes, Ted Kaczynski, was not identified until he wrote, and The Washington Post published, a lengthy and rambling environmental "manifesto" in 1995. Kaczynski's brother recognized his writing style and tipped off authorities, who traced the former math prodigy to a shabby cabin in Montana seven months later.
"Primary Colors" was a bestseller in 1996, largely because of an ingenious marketing gimmick: Its author was "Anonymous." As a result, the roman à clef about Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign fueled a grand guessing game about who wrote it, hyping its sales. Time magazine columnist Joe Klein, then at Newsweek, repeatedly denied that he was the author, but eventually admitted it.
Klein said in an interview that his authorship was very closely held; only his family and his agent knew he had written the book. Even his editor, Dan Menaker, thought the author was a woman, a bit of mistaken identity that Klein said he considered "high praise."
In the end, Klein said, he was done in by "a mistake": He wrote a few words in the margins of a manuscript that somehow wound up in the hands of a Washington Post reporter, David Streitfeld (now at the New York Times). Streitfeld compared it with another sample of Klein's handwriting and consulted an expert analyst. Game over.
Deep Throat was the legendary anonymous source for Post reporter Bob Woodward when he was reporting on President Richard Nixon in 1972 and 1973, who was made even more famous by Hal Holbrook's portrayal of him as a shadowy underground parking-lot denizen in the movie version of Woodward and Carl Bernstein's book, "All the President's Men."
Woodward never publicly revealed who Deep Throat was. The secret held despite extravagant third-party investigations (former Nixon aide Leonard Garment wrote an entire book about it in 2000, "In Search of Deep Throat," fingering the wrong guy).
It wasn't until 2005, as he neared death, that Mark Felt, a high-ranking FBI official during the Nixon years, stepped out of the metaphoric shadows and declared that he was Woodward's source.
During all the decades of Deep Throat's anonymity, Woodward said he revealed Felt's name to only three people: Bernstein; his Post editor, the late Ben Bradlee; and his wife, Elsa Walsh.
"I always used to joke with Ben Bradlee that the only way three people could keep a secret is if two of them are dead," said Woodward, citing a quip attributed to Benjamin Franklin. "There's some truth to that, but people really are capable of keeping secrets if they want to."
In an odd intertwining of history, Woodward played an indirect role in boosting the profile of the Times's anonymous op-ed writer. During the week the article was published, Woodward had begun promoting his book about Trump, "Fear," which documented infighting and chaos within his administration. The book and the op-ed told a consistent story, and the attention paid to one reinforced the other.
But Woodward is dismissive of the op-ed column now.
"What's lacking in the op-ed piece are specifics," he said. "If the person [who wrote it] had come to me when I was writing the book, I would have said, 'What are the specifics? What did you see? What did you participate in?'
"If they couldn't offer those details, I wouldn't have put it in the book. I would have said, 'Take it to the New York Times.' "
The author of the Times op-ed could not be reached for comment.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump's personal a ssistant, who's been with him since the start of his administration, has a bruptly left the White House after sharing intimate details about the President's family with reporters, multiple people tell CNN.
Madeleine Westerhout was forced to resign as executive assistant to the President on Thursday after Trump learned she had shared information with reporters at a recent off-the-record meeting, during which she didn't say her comments were off the record, according to sources familiar with her departure. A reporter divulged details about the dinner to White House staff, the people said.
A former White House official told CNN that Trump was close with Westerhout - whose office was directly in front of the Oval Office - but discussing personal information about his family was a red line.
Her ouster marks yet another departure from an administration beset by a series of exits by high-ranking officials, and it underlines the President's battle against the extensive leaks out of the White House and his greater campaign against the press.
The New York Times was the first to report Westerhout's exit. Citing a source with knowledge of her departure, The Times reported that Westerhout was considered a "separated employee" Thursday and would not be allowed to return to the White House on Friday.
A person familiar with the dinner at the Embassy Suites hotel in Berkeley Heights, New Jersey - where reporters stay during Trump's visits - said Westerhout and deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley attended a dinner alongside several reporters during his most recent trip.
These dinners are common during the President's trips and are typically treated as off the record, as was this one.
Westerhout's abrupt departure came as a surprise to her colleagues who had no idea about the matter, several people told CNN. She was seen as someone loyal to Trump and a true believer in his policies, sources said, though it has been reported in two books she was in tears when he won on Election Night.
Before joining the Trump administration, Westerhout served as the assistant to Republican National Committee Chief of Staff Katie Walsh, who later became a senior adviser to the Trump transition team.
In this role, Westerhout was frequently seen escorting key members of the Trump's transition team through the Trump Tower lobby.
"The President-elect wanted to make sure all of his meetings were very transparent, so it became a little bit more public than I originally thought it was going to be," she told CNN in 2016.
Westerhout was also one of six White House officials found to have violated the Hatch Act in 2018. - (CNN)

Marc Thiessen: Biden, Trump give voters an ultimatum but no inspiration

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — During a recent speech in New Hampshire, President Trump unveiled a new campaign line: “Whether you love me or hate me, you have got to vote for me.” Citing the strong economy, Trump told voters that if he loses, “your 401(k), everything is going to be down the tubes,” so “you have no choice!” To underscore the point, when he finished speaking the music that came on was the Rolling Stones singing, “You can’t always get what you want. But if you try sometimes, well, you might find, you get what you need.”
<img class="size-medium wp-image-2657222" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/Marc-Thiessen-color-2018-300x235.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="235" />
Not far away, in Nashua, the Biden campaign rolled out the very same message about its candidate. “I know that not all of you are committed to my husband, and I respect that,” Jill Biden told Democratic primary voters. “Your candidate might be better on, I don’t know, health care, than Joe is. But you’ve got to look at who’s going to win this election. And maybe you have to swallow a little bit and say, ‘Okay, I personally like so and so better,’ but your bottom line has to be that we have to beat Trump.”
To put it another way: “Whether you love Joe or hate him, you have got to vote for him.”
Trump and Biden are both running on the same message, but with one crucial difference: Trump is directing his at independent swing voters; Biden is directing that message at his base.
The New York Times reports that, despite his commanding lead in the polls, Biden faces a problem of low enthusiasm. While Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., “have followings rooted in zealous support for their ideas,” Biden’s support is rooted in a belief that he is the candidate best positioned to beat Trump. Patrick Murray, director of Monmouth University’s Polling Institute, told the paper that while spending time recently in Iowa “I did not meet one Biden voter who was in any way, shape or form excited about voting for Biden. They feel that they have to vote for Joe Biden as the centrist candidate, to keep somebody from the left who they feel is unelectable from getting the nomination.”
The danger of running on electability is that all it takes is one catastrophic gaffe or debate stumble for Biden’s support to collapse. And even if Biden manages to secure the Democratic nomination, running a campaign built exclusively on ousting the sitting president, rather than enthusiasm for your own ideas, is not a winning strategy. Just ask President Mitt Romney.
Trump, by contrast, has his base wrapped up and energized. The president consistently enjoys nearly 90% support among Republicans (in contrast with Barack Obama, who had just 75% support among Democrats at this stage in 2011, according to Gallup). For Trump, the risk of this strategy is not with his base, but with the swing voters who put him over the top in 2016.
According to Axios, in 2016 “20% of Trump’s voters told exit pollsters they didn’t like him.” These reluctant Trump voters put Trump in the White House and are critical to his keeping it in 2020. Like many Americans, they are exhausted by the chaos of the Trump presidency. Biden is targeting his message directly at these voters, echoing George W. Bush’s 2000 campaign pledge to restore “honor and dignity” to the Oval Office in the wake of the tumultuous Clinton presidency.
Yet, despite their exhaustion with Trump, many of these voters approve of his economic performance in office. Despite recent market turbulence, the U.S. economy remains strong. On Trump’s watch, unemployment has reached a five-decade low, and our biggest economic problem is that we have 1.6 million more job openings than we have unemployed workers to fill them. And a decade after the Great Recession, wages are finally rising, with those at the bottom of the economic ladder benefiting the most.
The problem is that Trump has made virtually no effort to win over these reluctant Trump voters again, much less expand his base by appealing to Americans who did not vote for him but are benefiting from his policies. He is betting that presidents seeking reelection in a full-employment economy don’t tend to lose. The danger is that, if the economy takes a nose dive, his argument for reelection with these voters does as well.
Biden and Trump are giving voters an ultimatum rather than inspiration. They both may find that running on your unlikability is a risky strategy.

Texto completo: LaToya Ruby Frazier has been teaching and working out of Chicago, the city she felt destined to live in, for almost six years now. Since 2013, the photographer focused on delivering social justice through her images has won a MacArthur Foundation "genius grant," had solo exhibitions at museums in cities including Brooklyn, Boston and Seattle, and seen her work collected by many of the nation's top museums.
But not until now has she had a solo show in Chicago.
"I've been embraced really well here," said Frazier, who's 37 and an associate professor of photography at the School of the Art Institute. "And so I am excited that it is the first show and that it's a show that I think this region can really relate to."
"The Last Cruze," opening at the Renaissance Society at the University of Chicago Sept. 14, continues Frazier's tradition, developed in her hometown of Braddock, Pennsylvania, outside Pittsburgh, of examining the Rust Belt and its resonances.
Judging by the selection of black-and-white photographs that have already been published in the New York Times Magazine, it promises to be an achingly close look at workers who rolled the final Chevrolet Cruze off the Lordstown, Ohio, assembly line before General Motors quit producing the compact car, closed Lordstown and relocated those workers who wanted to move to other factories.
"I'm very excited but also very somber," Frazier said in a late August interview in a conference room at the Ren. "Yesterday I spent a few hours on the phone with the secretary of Local 1112. They moved everybody as of yesterday. So, you know, it's sad, but at the same time I'm really proud because I know that I'm honoring really dignified, incredible working people."
To say that Frazier gets close to her work, and to the people in it, is an understatement. She describes a spring spent teaching three days at SAIC, then spending the next four, hour after hour, week after week, in and around Lordstown.
"The last Cruze came off on March 6th," she said. "The last gathering of the United Auto Workers was March 8th. After that, media ceased. No one was coming. And so here's where my practice is the most significant. What I'm doing in my work is asking the question, What does it look like when the media is gone and it's no longer headline news? What does it look like to see a worker idle, their life idle, not just the plant? That's the most important part of this whole story."
And it's not a story that ends, in Frazier's mind. "These aren't projects, right? This is my mission, my purpose, my life's work. And once I'm involved in someone's life photographically, these are relationships that go on forever. You keep going back. I keep going back."
Kasey King was the editor and photographer for the UAW Local 1112 newspaper, and she and Frazier became "photo buddies," said the artist, who also interviews and often includes quotes from the people she's shooting alongside their images.
King, who has now relocated to work for GM in Bowling Green, Kentucky, came away impressed by Frazier's dedication to the task. "You don't ever see her sidetracked with something else," said King. "She is focused on just getting your story and hearing it and really comprehending it. .... She's not just doing a sound bite or doing a quick story and moving on."
Frazier grew up in Braddock "next to Andrew Carnegie's steel mill," she said, in a town hard hit by industrial decline, racism and classism. Painting and drawing and possibly becoming a graphic designer changed in college, at Edinboro University in northwest Pennsylvania, thanks to an inspirational professor, Kathe Kowalski, who taught her that "social commentary through visual art was a possible life to have."
She learned to revere the work of Gordon Parks and other great photographers, to want to emulate Parks' practice wherein, she said, "the camera became a weapon."
Even before coming under Kowalski's wing, in her first photography class at the school, "we had a portrait assignment, and I remember I did a portrait of my cousin on the side of our house, and I put it up in class and (the professor) just said, "Look, you've raised the bar here in terms of portraiture, and I really think you should reconsider your major.' "
Her widely acclaimed first book, 2014's "The Notion of Family," showcases a long-running series of family photographs in Braddock that aim to make that tightly focused story a universal one of government and corporate abandonment.
"The whole Braddock project with especially the more autobiographical part was the thing that really got our attention first," said Michael Darling, chief curator of the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago, which has Frazier photos in its collection. "And I suppose that's where most of the art world kind of found out about her. It was that mix of making a social commentary about this economic problem, societal problem, but then also her interweaving her own personal story into it that felt really just so authentic and relatable and powerful."
Frazier went on to earn a masters in fine art photography at Syracuse University, then held academic and curatorial jobs at Yale and Rutgers before the SAIC opportunity came. "I knew since I was a little girl that I was going to live in Chicago one day. I knew it," she said.
She feels the Rust Belt connection between Pittsburgh and Chicago, she said, and a special affinity for the work of Studs Terkel, the Chicago oral historian similarly focused on advocating for working class people by documenting their lives.
"She is someone who both takes amazing photographs and has this really large, overarching vision," said Karsten Lund of the Renaissance Society, who co-curated the Frazier show. "I think it's really exceptional to find someone who's working at all those different levels."
But the more time you spend talking to Frazier, the more clear it becomes that this is something beyond work.
"I've made a commitment, right?" she said. "My life isn't my own. My work is in service to making sure that working class people in this country are seen and heard. I think that their lives are much more valuable and precious than CEOs' and politicians'. And it's about time that kind of power dynamic changes."

Texto completo: I have racked up more than my share of omelette memories from the past decade. Dozens of brown-skinned, overbeaten, five-egg monstrosities at greasy spoons up and down the East Coast; toothpick-skewered eggy spirals of tortilla, chunky with red pepper and potato at a pintxos bar in Barcelona; even a jiggly, ketchup-dabbed omu-rice in Tokyo that -- when I nicked it with the tip of my knife - hastily unzipped to expose its runny, golden interior.
But I had not tasted my favorite omelette of the last 10 years until I ate lunch last weekend at the Other Side Diner.
What makes this $12, spinach-and-Cabot-white-cheddar omelette so good is the same set of virtues that put the Other Side Diner into the same category as many of Portland's top restaurants, as well as that of its kissing cousin, the nationally celebrated Palace Diner in Biddeford.
Technique.
In much of the world, if you want to test a chef's skill, you ask her to prepare a classic, three-egg omelette. Sounds easy, right? But so much can go wrong, and with few ingredients, mistakes are nearly impossible to hide.
Temperature is key. But then again, so is salt. And now that you mention it, so is fat...and timing.
"We make ours in the traditional French style, so that it's soft and delicate," owner/general manager Jessica Sueltenfuss said. "It's three eggs, herbs, cheese. Not a lot else."
When folded over a wilted handful of fresh spinach, Other Side Diner's omelette is pale, silently disavowing any prior contact with a heat source -- certainly nothing as vulgar as a pan. Hold the plate up to the light from the restaurant's wall-spanning picture windows, and if you angle it just right, you might catch a single glint from melted butter on the omelette's surface. Perhaps.
That same attention to superb execution is applied across Other Side's menu, from the egg-salad sandwich that borrows a Japanese convenience-store trick of tiling crescents of still-drooling hard-boiled egg between slices of crisp white toast ($12), to a grilled chicken club that cleverly layers its fats (thick-cut, local peameal bacon and lemon-garlic mayonnaise) on opposite sides of the sandwich to prevent juices from the brined, butterflied chicken breast soaking into the toast ($13).
Even the hash browns, which Other Side serves plain ($5) or stuffed with a nugget of confit pork shoulder ($6) reveal head chef/owner/butcher Pete Sueltenfuess's comprehension of how a straightforward dish can be elevated with a playful technical tweak.
Combining shredded Maine potatoes with beaten egg and a little potato starch, he creates a starchy matrix that gets portioned directly into the deep-fryer with an unusual tool: an ice cream scoop. After a quick bath in hot oil, the result is a crunchy, flat-bottomed sphere that trails tentacles of caramelized potato. Break one apart with your fork, and you'll find tender, savory shreds steaming inside. I may never look at a hash brown the same way again.
Balance.
Still, an understanding of process only takes you so far as a chef. You also have to know what makes a dish taste good.
Ingredients that sparkle on their own might overwhelm or lose their luster when combined with others. Among these, herbs are notoriously tricky to get right -- especially tarragon.
Add too little, and it disappears into a nanoscale flash of green on your tongue. Add too much, and you wonder if someone snuck a Good N' Plenty into your food.
Other Side finds the ideal ratio of chopped parsley and tarragon to brighten the glutamic tang and nuttiness of the Cabot white cheddar in its omelette, while still leaving the focus firmly on the barely set Maine eggs.
Almost as an extra-credit homework assignment, the kitchen takes those very same herbs and reapportions them to enliven another, very different dish, the shrimp salad BLT ($13). Here, the saltiness of smoked, wet-cured bacon and sweetness of quick-poached Costa Rican shrimp from Laughing Bird Farm are offset by lemon-garlic mayonnaise and a judiciously generous dose of parsley and tarragon.
Simplicity.
Watch television cooking competitions and you can almost always identify the person who'll be sent home next. As soon as you spot someone in a pinch thinking they can get out of trouble by using one of the Three Horsemen of the Culinary Apocalypse -- caviar, truffles or foie gras -- you can practically hear the clock ticking.
Restaurants frequently tart up dishes with these same ingredients, thinking they add a veneer of sophistication. Worse, you'll sometimes see pyrotechnic extras like ghost pepper or edible gold leaf tossed in to disguise still-visible problems under an unnecessary (and expensive) scrim.
When you're making an excellent omelette from five or six components, every one of them counts. Each element has to be at least as good as the final product. Pete and Jessica Sueltenfuss, both trained at ingredient-focused restaurants like Fore Street and Boston's famed Eastern Standard, understand this well.
And because the couple has spent the past five years producing house-made charcuterie and selling sandwiches and deli meats made from local ingredients at their first business, the Other Side Delicatessen, they also understand sourcing.
"The concept at both the deli and the diner is really the same," Jessica Sueltenfuss said. "It's about simple cuisine with a little Greek influence to reflect Pete's family background (his mother's side is Greek) and being able to support local Maine farmers and producers and still be able to make breakfast at an affordable price."
I'd like to see them take things a step further, jettisoning their corporate bread supplier and shifting to some of the area's fantastic baked goods. I can imagine that their already-wonderful French toast ($11) would only improve if the thick slices of brioche were baked nearby.
Other Side takes simplicity a step further in its pared-down perspective on the traditionally turgid Greek diner menu. "When I think about those, I think about menus that are 8 pages long, and that's so overwhelming to me," Jessica Sueltenfuss said.
At Other Side, you'll find a concise list of eight lunch options, seven breakfast choices (served all day), and a few daily specials. Everything, including a kids' menu and a short list of beers and wine, fits on one side of a sheet of printer paper.
Brevity suits the 35-seat restaurant. As does a new paint-job that softens the eye-watering orange-and-red color scheme left behind by previous tenant Hella Good Tacos into a desaturated, 1950s-noir. DÃ©cor is no longer a distraction.
Today, the room's simple aesthetics gently guide your focus back to where it belongs: the invisible upgrades on your plate. So when you cut into a triple-decker stack of lemon-zest-infused pancakes ($11), you'll notice how they stand up taller than most do. A little Greek yogurt (naturally) gives them their fluffy structure and also helps them retain moisture.
Don't cheap out: spring for the house-made lowbush Maine blueberry compote ($2). It adds a pleasing layer of mineral sweetness and - no surprise - clocks in at only three ingredients: sugar, blueberries and lemon zest.

The truth about James Comey

Texto completo: On Jan. 28, 2017, a day after having dinner with President Trump at the White House, James Comey wrote a memo recording his recollection of the evening and the conversation.
“I felt comfortable throughout,” he wrote, “although never relaxed, given the focus the conversation required.”
Comey noted that the president had asked him, “So what do you want to do?” in the context of a discussion of whether the then-FBI director would stay in that job or move on.
“I responded by saying that he could fire me any time he wished, but that I wanted to stay,” Comey wrote. “I added that I was ‘reliable’ in one way but not in the way political people sometimes use the term. I explained that he could count on me to always tell him the truth. I said I don’t do sneaky things, I don’t leak, I don’t do weasel moves.”
Then the president asked “whether the FBI leaks.” Comey wrote that he told Trump the whole government leaks like crazy, and “he replied that he needed loyalty and expected loyalty.”
If that phrase sounds familiar, it may be because it was one of the leaks that was splashed all over newspaper front pages and TV news shows from Comey’s memos of his conversations with Trump, which he had secretly stored in his personal safe at his home and retrieved after the FBI locked him out of his office a few months later, on the day the president fired him.
It might have saved the country a lot of time and stress if Comey had leaked the quotation that the president “could fire me any time he wished.” But that might have inhibited calls for an investigation into potential obstruction of justice.
That’s not what Comey wanted. He wanted a special counsel to investigate the president.
According to the new report from the Justice Department’s Office of Inspector General, Comey improperly stashed private copies of four of seven memos he wrote to document his official meetings with Trump. One of them memorialized the conversation in a one-on-one meeting on February 14, 2017, in which Trump had said he hoped Comey could “see [his] way clear … to letting [Michael] Flynn go.”
Days after he was fired on May 9, 2017, Comey texted photos of “Memo 4” to his personal attorney and friend, Daniel Richman, with specific instructions to share the contents, but not the document, with a New York Times reporter.
The newspaper ran the story the same day under the headline, “Comey memo says Trump asked him to end Flynn investigation.” It related all the details that Comey had noted about the Oval Office meeting, including the notation about “letting Flynn go.”
The inspector general’s report says Comey did not mark Memo 4 as classified, even though Flynn was the subject of a non-public FBI investigation at the time. Instead, he gave one copy to his chief of staff to keep at the FBI and he secretly kept a copy in his personal safe at home.
We didn’t need the IG report to know why Comey arranged the leak. He told us himself, in testimony before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in June 2017 that he did it to “prompt the appointment of a special counsel.” He said he was concerned that Trump might destroy tapes of their conversations: “My judgment was, I need to get that out into the public square. I asked a friend of mine to share the content of the memo with a reporter.”
The inspector general thought that explanation was unacceptable. “Comey had several other lawful options available to him to advocate for the appointment of a special counsel, which he told us was his goal in making the disclosure,” the IG wrote. “What was not permitted was the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive investigative information, obtained during the course of FBI employment, in order to achieve a personally desired outcome.”
What was the outcome that Comey personally desired? Was it really the appointment of a special counsel in order to force the preservation of supposed tapes in the White House? Or did he reveal his true goal with his own words?
In the same testimony before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in June 2017, Comey was asked by Sen. John Cornyn about the Hillary Clinton email investigation and former President Bill Clinton’s tarmac meeting with Attorney General Loretta Lynch just as the investigation was wrapping up.
“After former President Clinton met on the plane with the attorney general, I considered whether I should call for the appointment of a special counsel and decided that would be an unfair thing to do because I knew there was no case there,” Comey testified, speaking of the Clinton email investigation. “And calling for the appointment of a special counsel would be brutally unfair because it would send the message, ‘Uh-huh, there’s something here.’ ”
Cornyn asked, “If a special counsel had been appointed, they could have made that determination there was nothing there and declined to pursue it, right?”
“Sure,” Comey answered, “but it would have been many months later or a year later.”
If that isn’t enough to prove that Comey intended and knowingly acted to smear the president with an endless investigation based on no wrongdoing, consider Comey’s notes from the Jan. 27 dinner meeting, the one in which he said he doesn’t do sneaky things, doesn’t leak, doesn’t do weasel moves.
Comey wrote that Trump said the salacious story about prostitutes in a Russian hotel was “a complete fabrication and ‘fake news,’” and the president “said he thought maybe he should ask me to investigate the whole thing to prove it was a lie.”
“I replied that it was up to him,” Comey wrote, “but I wouldn’t want to create a narrative that we were investigating him, because we are not and I worried such a thing would be misconstrued. I also said that it is very difficult to disprove a lie.”
It sure is. It’s even more difficult when the liar hides behind the fine reputation of federal law enforcement agents, people who did their greatest work for the country on the day they locked James Comey out of the building.

Media role is to draw out candidates

Texto completo: The media are poised to deliver another election victory to President Donald Trump, because their constant bashing of the president turns off many Americans who are middle-of-the-road voters.
The problem with beating Trump relentlessly is that the excess involved makes even the most serious and legitimate criticism of the president and his policies seem like sport — something to indulge in for the mere enjoyment of it, but without any power to bring perspicacity and persuasion to the debate.
Consider the president's visit to Dayton, Ohio, and El Paso following the mass shootings that happened in those cities.
I was pleased to see the New York Times carry the headline that read "Trump urges unity vs racism."
I thought that it was decent of the newspaper to put politics aside and focus instead on the unifying aspects of the presidential visit.
My approbation, however, was short-lived. Possibly owing to the intense backlash it received for the headline, the newspaper saw fit to change it to "Assailing hate but not guns."
This, I thought to myself, is not reflective of responsible journalism. Tergiversation is the art form of politicians, not newspapers.
A newspaper shouldn't change a headline because it comes under pressure. Instead, it should explicate the reasons for the headline.
In many instances, the idea of fake news itself is fake, but try telling that to the people who are nonbelievers in the media's honesty.
If Hillary Clinton ever had the chance of winning the presidency, the media spoiled it for her by being less than tough with her on issues and shielding her from proper criticism.
It is good for a candidate to get a thorough cleansing, to have all the issues aired out so that the defining ones become fully framed and do not suffer from distraction and devolution.
I watched the two recent Democratic debates with a fair degree of dismay.
For the most part, the candidates sailed through it without bruising, but that is not what independent voters want.
Immigration, border security, law enforcement, health care, violence in society, and trade cannot be wrapped in gratuitous, sentimental sound bites. However, that is precisely what the candidates seemed to bring to the debate.
I do not bend my feelings toward candidates because they speak of grand schemes like "free tuition for all" and "Medicare for all."
I want to know what mechanism will pay for these programs, and what class of citizens will form the axle and wheels of that mechanism.
I am not interested in any dialog that skirts the real issues and feeds instead on fancies and utopias.
It is the job of debate moderators to pull the candidates away from their comfort zones and talking points with tough and incisive questioning.
Except for two or three sharp exchanges, the debates were boring because the candidates were allowed to walk their political positions with insouciance, and without challenge or contradiction.
A man must have all his weaknesses exposed before he can recognize his strengths. To stand in the soft light of perfection is not to acknowledge the harsh light that falls naturally on all aspects of life and the world.
The man who stumbles and then regains his composure is more attractive politically than another who carefully avoids pitfalls with an unnatural and choreographed walk.
In politics, as in life, the facade of invincibility and flawlessness is easily penetrated by incipient truth and then quickly shattered by it.
Therefore, truth with blemish is a far better accoutrement of politics than disguise and dissimulation.

Texto completo: ALBANY – Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand dropped her bid for president Wednesday after she failed to qualify for the next Democratic debate.
Gillibrand, a New York Democrat, posted a video message to her supporters confirming her decision, making her the latest Democrat to drop out of the crowded field looking to challenge Republican President Donald Trump next year.
A 10-year veteran of the Senate, Gillibrand campaigned heavily throughout Iowa and New Hampshire in the months after launching her campaign in January.
But she struggled to raise campaign funds and generate support in the key public-opinion polls used to determine the field for the primary debates, leaving her out of next month's ABC News/Univision debate in Houston.
In a video posted to her social media accounts, Gillibrand vowed to continue to work to defeat Trump and flip the Senate into Democratic hands.
"I know this isn't the result we wanted," Gillibrand said. "We wanted to win this race. But it's important to know when it's not your time and to know how you can best serve your community and country."
Gillibrand, of Brunswick, Rensselaer County, made family-related issues a centerpiece of her campaign, often highlighting her experiences as a mother as she pushed for a national paid family leave policy.
She was also outspoken on abortion issues, vowing only to appoint Supreme Court justices who support Roe v. Wade abortion rights.
Gillibrand, 52, was re-elected to a six-year term in the Senate last November. Within days of her re-election, she confirmed interest in a 2020 presidential bid despite previously vowing to serve a full Senate term.
She has been in the Senate since 2009, when she was appointed to succeed Hillary Clinton, who had gone on to become secretary of state.
Prior to that, Gillibrand served in the House of Representatives, representing a conservative-leaning district north of Albany.
Gillibrand based her presidential campaign in Troy, not far from her upstate New York home.
Officially eliminated from debate This week, she was officially eliminated from the upcoming Sept. 12 debate when she failed to meet the Democratic National Committee's polling threshold, which required candidates to garner 2% support in at least four qualified polls and have at least 130,000 individual donors to make the debate stage.
In an interview with The New York Times, Gillibrand said she would endorse a Democratic candidate in the race but has not yet decided who.
She also vowed to support the eventual Democratic nominee.
Gillibrand did qualify for the first two Democratic primary debates, enjoying a viral moment in the second one when asked what her first act as president would be.
"The first thing that I'm going to do when I'm president is I'm going to Clorox the Oval Office," Gillibrand said to big applause.
In a tweet, Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, called Gillibrand a "great talent, a rising star in the Democratic Party & a good friend."
"The people of NY are fortunate to have her back full time," Cuomo tweeted.
Gillibrand's exit leaves two New York Democrats vying for their party's presidential nomination: New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and Andrew Yang, a New York City entrepreneur who was born in Schenectady.
Yang qualified for the next debate; de Blasio did not.

Texto completo: If you’re in downtown Lancaster prior to the Flogging Molly concert at the Lancaster County Convention Center on Sunday, there’s a good chance you’ll catch guitarist Dennis Casey riding his bike around town.
“I just read that New York Times story on the cuisine in Lancaster, so I’ll definitely be checking out Central Market and maybe Issei Noodle if I have time,” Casey says via telephone.
Casey and Flogging Molly are currently on a co-headlining tour with fellow longstanding punk institution Social Distortion, bringing the band to Lancaster for the first time. Despite both bands’ combined 63 years of experience, this will be the first tour uniting them. Rounding out the bill on Sunday are The Devil Makes Three from Santa Cruz, California, and Le Butcherettes of Guadalajara, Mexico.
Flogging Molly has brought its particular brand of fast, Irish-influenced punk rock all around the world since 1997, with Casey joining the band two years later in time for the debut album, “Swagger,” in 2000.
Since then, the band has played hundreds of shows, created its own seafaring voyage in the form of the yearly Salty Dog Cruise and inspired the raising of countless beers for toasting the world over.
“It really just never ceases to amaze me to look out into an audience in a place like Japan or Colombia, which we played earlier this year, where English is not the first language, and they’re still loving it,” Casey explains. “I know the world has changed, but still, seeing these people who know the band and bought a ticket to see us play is so interesting and humbling to me. I’m very grateful for that.”
Flogging Molly’s fervent fan base helped bring the band’s most recent studio album, 2017’s “Life is Good,” into the upper half of the Billboard Top 200 Albums chart. In 2018, the band dropped two songs, held over from the “Life is Good” sessions, “Going Home” and “There’s Nothing Left Pt. 2.” Casey says that the band is taking stock of the ways the music has changed in the two decades the band has been together.
“After the cruise (in November), we’re going to take some time off and start writing again,” Casey says. “Ideally, I’d like to do both release albums and standalone singles. I think we have a fan base that is still into the idea of full records. Having said that, I’m somebody who buys records still and streams music, it really changes the way you listen to music.”
For a band that tours as frequently as Flogging Molly does — with nearly 100 shows played in 2018 and 79 already this year, according to set list tracking website setlist.fm — it helps to shake the set list up on a regular basis. Fans of bands playing lesser-known songs and album cuts, fear not — Casey is firmly on your side.
“I’ve been asking Dave (King, lead singer and songwriter) to the point of bugging him, like, ‘Let’s do this song or that song,’ ” Casey says. “I’m a big fan of deep cuts. Not necessarily doing a full set of them or anything, but it’s always good to bring some back now and then. With this tour, we’re definitely pulling them out.”
In November, the band departs for the fifth annual Salty Dog Cruise, which sets sail from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, to the Bahamas. This year, luminaries such as Frank Turner, Pennywise and Stiff Little Fingers will join the band aboard the Serenade of the Seas. In previous years, the band has used the cruise to test out new material and, on one occasion, play its debut album, “Swagger,” from start to finish. Coincidentally, that album celebrates a 20th anniversary in 2020, which Casey admits might be a clue to one of the bands’ many plans heading into the new year.
It’s been a long journey for Casey, who quit his job as a house painter to join Flogging Molly 20 years ago.
“The last house I had, I said to myself, ‘I’m going to paint this thing myself,’ ” Casey says with a laugh. “By the end three weeks later, I told my wife to never let me do that again. But I can still do it!”
Flogging Molly and Social Distortion perform at Freedom Hall on Sunday, September 1. Tickets can be found online here and will be available at the door.

DOJ watchdog struggled to track down mystery source for New York Times 'loyalty' pledge report

Texto completo: The second source mentioned in a New York Times article from May 2017 about a dinner former FBI Director James Comey had with President Trump remains a mystery after the Justice Department inspector general released a report on Comey's notes memorializing his conversations with Trump.
The 83-page report, released on Thursday, shows Inspector General Michael Horowitz tried to track down the second source, asking former top officials at the FBI to no avail.
The Times article, published on May 11, 2017, described a Jan. 27 dinner at the White House in which Trump asked for Comey’s “loyalty.” “Two people who have heard [Comey’s] account of the dinner” were cited sources. The White House has denied its validity.
Daniel Richman, a friend and attorney to Comey, admitted to Horowitz that he was one of the sources — something which has already been publicly known. Comey claims he gave some of his memos to Richman after Trump fired him on May 9 to leak to the media, hoping this would spark a special counsel investigation.
The watchdog report shows Richman said he knew about the dinner because Comey told him about it while discussing the challenges of his job. Richman said he was called by a Times reporter, with whom he was friends, on May 9 after Comey was fired. Richman told the reporter what he had remembered about the dinner.
At the time of their conversation, Richman said he had not yet seen the memo in which Comey described the meeting. Richman said he did not receive copies of Comey’s memos about his conversations with Trump until days later.
In attempting to track down both sources for that report, the inspector general asked former FBI General Counsel James Baker, former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, and McCabe’s special counsel Lisa Page if they knew the identities of the two sources.
“They each told us that they did not,” the report said.
Comey’s chief of staff James Rybicki told investigators he had not provided the contents of any of Comey’s memos to “anyone outside the FBI.”
The inspector general interviewed 17 witnesses as part of its investigation into Comey’s handling of his memos about Trump.
Comey wrote the memo on his personal laptop after he arrived home from the dinner. He said he dated it Jan. 28 because he woke up the next morning and made “minor corrections.” He placed a printout of the memo in his personal safe at home and gave a second copy to Rybicki to keep at the FBI. He then said he deleted the file from his laptop. The FBI later determined that six words in the memo qualified as classified information.
Comey instructed Rybicki to show the memo to McCabe and Baker, and then keep it in his possession at FBI headquarters.
Comey also allowed his former chief of staff Chuck Rosenberg to review the memo.
“At that time, Rosenberg was serving as Acting Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration and held an active TS/SCI security clearance, but had no official need to know about Comey's interactions with President Trump,” the report said. Rosenberg told the inspector general he was at Comey’s house during the weekend following Comey’s dinner with Trump.
“According to Rosenberg, Comey handed him a laptop, Rosenberg read the Memo on the laptop screen, and then handed the laptop back to Comey. Comey told the OIG that it was ‘possible’ he allowed Rosenberg to review Memo 2, but stated that he did not remember sharing it with him,” the report said.
Horowitz's investigation of Comey found that he "violated" FBI policy in his handling of sensitive information, but determined he did not leak classified information to the media. The watchdog criminally referred Comey to the Justice Department for his conduct, but the agency declined to prosecute.

Marvel Revises a Page With Captain America

Texto completo: Marvel Comics No. 1000, a special issue in honor of 80 years of storytelling, was supposed to be a cause for celebration. But revisions to one page of the comic, which came out Wednesday, are casting a pall over the festivities.
The page, written by Mark Waid and drawn by John Cassady, is narrated by Captain America. In earlier versions of the page that comic-book retailers received in July, the star-spangled hero opened with: "I'm asked how it is possible to love a country that's deeply flawed. It's hard sometimes. The system isn't just. We've treated some of our own abominably."
He went on to say that fixing America's system is "hard and bloody work" but that it could be done when enough people take to the streets, call for revolution and say, "Injustice will not stand."
Captain America concludes: "That's what you can love about America."
The version that arrived in stores and online, however, has new text, also written by Waid, in which Captain America ruminates on his own image, not the United States: "Captain America isn't a man. It's an idea. It's a commitment to fight every day for justice, for acceptance and equality, for the rights of everyone in this nation." The hero says that those qualities -- "not hatred, not bigotry, not exclusion" -- are the values of true patriotism.
Marvel and Waid declined to say why the page was changed. But in an email message, Waid expressed frustration at how his original text was being presented. "I'm disappointed that the cherry-picked quotes circulated by the media severely mischaracterize what was actually written," he wrote. While the essay was critical, he added, "As written, Cap is supportive of America as a whole."
The change to the Captain America text comes nearly two weeks after The Guardian reported that the cartoonist Art Spiegelman said he was asked to remove criticism of President Trump from a foreword for the upcoming book "Marvel: The Golden Age 1939-1949," published by the Folio Society. The essay, which The Guardian published, included the line, "In today's all too real world, Captain America's most nefarious villain, the Red Skull, is alive on screen and an Orange Skull haunts America." Spiegelman said he was told by the Folio Society that Marvel was trying to stay apolitical. Folio and Marvel didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on the change.
Captain America, who made his debut in 1940 (though the comic had a cover date of 1941), has a long and tangled relationship with American politics. In the issue of his own title that came out Wednesday, written by Ta-Nehisi Coates and drawn by Jason Masters and Sean Izaakse, he finds himself at the Southern border of the United States, helping to guarantee safe passage for a group of migrants. When one of them asks why they were being hunted, Cap answers: "Ignorance. Ignorance and hate."
In 2016, a story twist made the hero an operative of Hydra, a Nazi-like organization that was out for world domination. Fans of the character did not like seeing the patriotic champion in such a light, prompting Marvel to issue a statement asking readers "to allow the story to unfold before coming to any conclusion."
The character eventually returned to the side of the good guys but not without damage to his reputation. That is one of the themes Coates explores in the current Captain America series. "This is a game of public relations," an ally tells him. "If that doesn't suit you, I've got a better word: redemption."

Democrats express concern about president's alleged pardon guarantees

Texto completo: Through his pardons of political allies, conservative defenders and others convicted of federal crimes, President Trump throughout his term has sent indirect signals of his willingness to help those close to him escape punishment.
And now, the president has entwined that message with his chief campaign promise - by privately assuring aides that he would pardon them of any potential illegality as the administration rushes to build his border wall before he returns to the ballot next November.
The notion has alarmed congressional Democrats, who had been investigating potential obstruction of justice on Trump's part as the House continues to weigh whether to launch impeachment proceedings once lawmakers return to Washington next month.
Rep. David N. Cicilline (R.I.), a member of the House Democratic leadership and the House Judiciary Committee, said any suggestion that Trump would encourage subordinates to break the law by promising pardons is "appalling" and worthy of further investigation by the panel.
"Sadly, this is just one more instance of a president who undermines the rule of law and behaves as if he's a king and not governed by the laws of this country," Cicilline said in an interview Wednesday. "He is not a king, he is accountable . . . I think it just adds to the ongoing proceeding before the Judiciary Committee as we consider whether to recommend articles of impeachment against the president."
Trump on Wednesday denied that he had made those private assurances, first reported Tuesday evening by The Washington Post. Yet a White House official who spoke on the condition of anonymity in advance of the report did not deny it and said Trump is joking when he makes such statements about pardons.
"Another totally Fake story in the Amazon Washington Post (lobbyist) which states that if my Aides broke the law to build the Wall (which is going up rapidly), I would give them a Pardon," Trump tweeted Wednesday afternoon. "This was made up by The Washington Post only in order to demean and disparage - FAKE NEWS!"
The Post is owned by Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, although it is run independently from the online retail enterprise.
The wall discussions are not the first time that Trump has reportedly promised a pardon to a subordinate for doing something potentially illegal.
In April, the New York Times reported that Trump told acting Homeland Security secretary Kevin McAleenan that he would pardon him if he directed his employees to illegally deny asylum to migrants who request it at the southern border. Trump later denied doing so in a tweet, calling it "Another Fake Story."
Members of the House Judiciary Committee sent a letter to McAleenan requesting information and documents on the incident; a panel spokesman did not respond to a question about whether McAleenan ever responded. The committee said in a statement at the time that "offering a pardon to encourage an officer of the U.S. government to undertake an illegal action appears on its face to be an unconstitutional abuse of power."
Several Democrats said Trump's pardon comments were fair game for investigation as they continue to delve into details of potential obstruction of justice on the part of Trump that emerged from former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's investigation.
"The fall is a period is when we are expanding the scope of our investigation beyond the Mueller report," said Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), who like Cicilline is a member of the Judiciary Committee. "The abuse of the pardon power fits in with our broader investigation into the abuse of the powers of the presidency."
Raskin added: "It's similar to the president ordering the executive branch not to cooperate with congressional investigations. That is an abuse of power and an assault on the separation of powers."
Cicilline said it did not matter whether Trump's subordinates ultimately carried out his illegal directives.
"It's an abuse of the pardon power, it's an abuse of the president's authority, and it's very likely illegal," he said. "So whether anyone actually does it or not - that idea that the president of the United States, responsible for enforcing and upholding the rule of law in this country, is making a statement like that is just appalling."
Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), chairman of the House Judiciary panel, did not comment on the issue Wednesday.
Several of the 15 pardons that Trump has issued during his presidency - a power that is nearly unchecked and that Trump has relished - have carried with them an overtly political tone.
The first pardon Trump issued as president went to Joe Arpaio, the former sheriff of Maricopa County, Ariz., whose controversial tactics on immigration enforcement garnered legal challenges and a conviction on a criminal contempt of court charge. Trump pardoned him of that crime in August 2017 - less than a month after the conviction and weeks before he was set to be sentenced.
In April 2018, Trump pardoned I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby, the former chief of staff to former vice president Richard B. Cheney, who had been convicted on perjury and obstruction of justice charges. Trump suggested Libby had been treated unfairly by the prosecution as it probed the leak of the identity of Valerie Plame, a CIA officer.
Trump said at the time that he did not personally know Libby, but the pardon came as several former Trump associates had pleaded guilty to similar charges amid Mueller's Russia probe.
The following month, Trump gave a full pardon to Dinesh D'Souza, a conservative commentator who had pleaded guilty to illegally using straw donors for a Republican Senate candidate in New York.
As with Libby, Trump concluded that D'Souza had been mistreated and said at the time that he was also considering clemency for former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich (D) and lifestyle guru Martha Stewart. The three had been convicted of crimes similar to charges faced by former Trump associates as part of the Mueller probe.
In May of this year, Trump pardoned Conrad Black, who in 2007 was convicted on fraud and obstruction of justice charges. The billionaire last year penned a flattering biography of the president, "Donald J. Trump: A president like no other," that defended him against accusations of racism and praised him for the "optimism to persevere and succeed, the confidence to affront tradition and convention, a genius for spectacle, and a firm belief in common sense and the common man."
Trump has even pondered pardoning himself - tweeting in June 2018 amid the Mueller probe that he has the "absolute right" to do so and that his argument was bolstered by "numerous legal scholars." (Whether Trump can actually do so is up for debate.)
"More than one isolated remark, it's the pattern that's concerning," Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said of Trump's pardon tendencies. "As much as what he may do, or not, is the message that it sends to the American people about his view of the importance of law and law enforcement."

Texto completo: El presidente Donald Trump afirmó que la Agencia Federal de Manejo de Emergencias (FEMA) y otras dependencias están monitoreando el avance de la tormenta tropical Dorian, un fenómeno meteorológico que, dijo, “como siempre”, impactará a Puerto Rico, además de criticar los señalamientos hacia su administración por las acciones en la isla tras el paso del huracán María en 2017.
“FEMA y otros están listos, y harán un gran trabajo. Cuando lo hagan, háganles saber que lo hicieron y denles una grandes Gracias – No como la última vez”, criticó el mandatario. “¡Eso incluye a lo que proviene de la incompetente alcaldesa de San Juan!”.
El mandatario se refiere a Carmen Yulín , quien ha sido una de las principales críticas a su gobierno por falta de acciones para recuperar a Puerto Rico de las devastaciones por el huracán María, las cuales habrían dejado más de 4,000 muertos indirectos, debido a problemas de servicios en hospitales, según un reporte de The New York Times.
We are tracking closely tropical storm Dorian as it heads, as usual, to Puerto Rico. FEMA and all others are ready, and will do a great job. When they do, let them know it, and give them a big Thank You – Not like last time. That includes from the incompetent Mayor of San Juan!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 28, 2019
El mandatario continuó con sus comentarios negativos hacia la isla, que recientemente enfrentó la renuncia del gobernador Ricardo Roselló , luego de revelarse una serie de mensajes racistas y sexistas entre sus colaboradores, además de serios problemas de corrupción que llevaron a la detención de Julia Keleher , exsecretaria de Educación, acusada de dirigir ilícitamente cientos de miles de dólares en contratos para colaboradores cercanos en 2017.
“Puerto Rico esuno de los lugares más corruptos en la tierra”, consideró el presidente Trump. “Su sistema político está roto y sus políticos son incompetentes o corruptos. El Congreso aprobó miles de millones de dólares la última vez, más de lo que ningún lugar ha recibido, y fue enviado a los Corruptos Amigos. ¡No está bien!”, expresó el presidente. Agregó que él es lo mejor que le ha pasado a la isla.
“¡Y, por cierto, soy la mejor cosa que le haya pasado a Puerto Rico!” , expresó.
….And by the way, I’m the best thing that’s ever happened to Puerto Rico!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 28, 2019
Se espera que el la tormentan tropital Dorian toque tierra este miércoles y podría convertirse en huracán Categoría 3, indicó Associated Press. Incluso en su actual nivel, los daños a la isla serían catastróficos, considerando los problemas que el huracán María ocasionó y servicios e infraestructura y no han sido repuestos al cien por ciento.

Securing the blessings of capitalism

Texto completo: Is big business rediscovering a social conscience? Time will tell, but the manifesto issued last week by the Business Roundtable is at least an encouraging word in that direction. It sharply departs from 50 years of economic orthodoxy, which held that the only duty of corporations was to maximize profits for shareholders.
The Business Roundtable, a lobbying group that represents many of America’s biggest companies, now says that besides serving investors, corporations must also compensate their employees fairly and invest in training and education to help them develop new skills; protect the environment by embracing sustainable practices; support the communities in which they are located; and treat suppliers fairly.
This is a long way from the “greed is good” credo that big business and Wall Street have embraced since the 1970s under the influence of the University of Chicago school of economics. But as critics such as Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren were quick to point out, the statement lacked specifics as to how this new mission statement will be put into effect.
There’s little doubt that the impetus for the statement was the intense social and political pressure corporate America is feeling to do good in addition to doing well. The doctrine of maximizing shareholder value to the exclusion of other values is heavily implicated in the rise of income inequality, and corporations are being pressed to address that issue as well as climate change, diversity, gun policy, immigration reform and public health.
“They’re responding to something in the zeitgeist,” Nancy Koehn, a historian at Harvard Business School, told The New York Times. “They perceive that business as usual is no longer acceptable. It’s an open question whether any of these companies will change the way they do business.”
What kind of actions would show proof of sincerity on the part of these corporate giants? Here are few:
Support legislation that passed the House last month that would raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2025. It has languished at $7.25 an hour since 2009, the longest period without an increase since it was established in 1938. An analysis by the Congressional Budget Office concluded that the increase would lift 1.3 million people out of poverty and could lead to wage increases for up to 27 million working people, although it would also reduce employment by 0.8 percent, or 1.3 million jobs.
Develop guidelines for the compensation of CEOs that reward them for pursuing socially responsible policies as well as for turning profits for investors. Those guidelines should also address the proper relationship between the compensation of chief executives and the pay of their employees. According to one recent analysis of federal data, the average chief executive of an S&P 500 company earned 287 times more than the median employee at their company in 2018. That is not healthy, for workers, for companies or for CEOs.
Refrain from discouraging efforts by employees to unionize. Unions provide a countervailing force to corporate power, and their demise in recent decades has left rank-and-file employees with little leverage to gain better pay, benefits and working conditions. When unions were healthy during the postwar era, prosperity was much more widely shared. If the Business Roundtable is serious about fostering “diversity and inclusion, dignity and respect” among workers, it must recognize that unions have a role to play in securing those ends.
Embrace Sen. Warren’s proposal to transform big American companies by letting workers elect at least 40% of board members. That would give workers significant say in the management of their working lives and put other board members in close touch with the issues that mean the most to employees.
It is an article of faith among corporate executives that capitalism is the best economic system ever devised. They can prove it by taking steps to secure its blessings for all, not just investors.

Galaxy’s Edge: You’ve landed on another planet now

Texto completo: Disney is so into Star Wars that there’s even a hotel coming up, called Halcyon, that will immerse guests in a Jedi world.
But first...get immersed at Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge, the themed land that opens Thursday at Disney’s Hollywood Studios.
This 14-acre land is expected to be so popular that Disney resort guests get “extra extra magic hours” and can get in as early as 6 a.m. from Sept. 1 through Nov. 2.
The land is supposed to look like “the Black Spire Outpost on the planet of Batuu.” This once-thriving outpost is now home to droids, smugglers, rogue traders and other creatures trying to stay out of sight of the First Order.
If this means nothing to you, as it does to this writer, just go to the Epcot International Food & Wine Festival and have a Key Lime mimosa at Shimmering Sips.
But...if you are a Star Wars fanatic, expect to be wowed.
One ride is open — Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run, where you fly Han Solo’s junker-looking starship. Fans online have described this ride as “life changing.” (Look for Post staffer and Star Wars junkie Dan Scapusio’s live report from Galaxy’s edge at PalmBeachPost.com today.)
The ride uses technology that responds to how you use the cockpit controls, so you have to work with your co-pilot.
Disney’s Scott Trowbridge told The New York Times: “It’s a personalized intergalactic ride — live your own ‘Star Wars’ story. If you crash into a wall, that’s what you’ll see out the cockpit window.”
On Dec. 5, a second ride opens: Rise of the Resistance, a ride Disney is billing as the most immersive Disney attraction ever built.
It’s a trackless dark ride that puts you in the middle of a battle between the First Order and the Resistance. Fifty animatronic stormtroopers are involved, so you’ll have to hope the Force is with you.
In the meantime, what brings Galaxy’s Edge to life are the Batuu “residents,” basically, cast members dressed to look like villagers, First Order soldiers or Resistance members.
Chewbacca might be walking around, too.
The characters interact with guests, and if you’re into that, great.
If not, go to Epcot and chase your mimosa with a Guinness and Bailey’s shake at the Ireland marketplace.
If you tire of droids and smugglers while inside Galaxy’s Edge, there are a few places to get food, including Olga’s Cantina.
This place looks like a watering hole right out of the original Star Wars.
So, here’s the deal: Stay at a Disney resort and get in early, because Galaxy’s Edge might get to capacity fast.
Extra extra magic hours are also happening at Disney’s other theme parks through Nov. 2, but they are only available if you stay at a Disney resort.
From Thursday to Nov. 2, guests at Disney resorts can get into the Animal Kingdom and Magic Kingdom at 7 a.m. and Hollywood Studios, including Galaxy’s Edge and Toy Story Land, at 6 a.m.
When Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge opened in Disneyland a few months ago, it was at capacity within an hour of opening, with waits for Millennium Falcon at three hours. Crowds eased up later in the day.
If you can’t stand to wait, just remember: You can go right over to the Epcot Food & Wine Festival and slug down some Apple Pie beer.
And check out the Food & Wine merchandise, including a Tervis wine glass that you can wear in a special sling around your neck. Now that’s an out-of-this-world way to drink your way around the world!

Texto completo: Former CIA Director John Brennan says world leaders view President Trump as not only "incompetent," but also "delusional."
Harping on Trump's deference to Russian President Vladimir Putin, Brennan said the president "still does not grasp the seriousness of what it is that Putin has done."
"Not only to Ukraine, but also the fact that he interfered in our election, continues to support the genocide of President Assad in Syria. All of these transgressions that have come from the Russians," Brennan said on MSNBC, where he is a contributor.
Brennan, a vocal critic of the president who was CIA director during the Obama administration, slammed Trump's suggestion to readmit Russia to the group of the world’s seven largest economies just before a G-7 summit in France. Russia was expelled from the then-G-8 in 2014 after it seized Crimea from Ukraine.
"For him then to say blithely that he believes that they should get back into what would be the G-8 despite the unanimous view of those countries previously that because of the annexation of Crimea, because of what they’ve been doing in Eastern Ukraine, that Russia does not deserve a seat at the table. So, it’s still rather puzzling as to why Donald Trump continues to give Putin the benefit of the doubt when, in fact, he should be coming down pretty hard on the Russian leader," Brennan said.

Trump announced Monday he intends to invite Putin to the G-7 summit in 2020, which the U.S. will host. “I think it would be better to have Russia inside the tent than outside the tent,” Trump said. Trump's push to make amends with Putin comes after former special counsel Robert Mueller warned Russia is still trying to meddle in U.S. elections.
Host Chris Hayes asked Brennan if he believes world leaders and intelligence services have changed the way they act toward Trump because of his propensity to be unprepared and unpredictable.
“Absolutely. I think a lot of the leaders have written off what he says certainly publicly," Brennan said. "But also, I’m very concerned given his public dishonesty, what dishonesty is he engaged in the private meetings with these world leaders, with those allies of countries that we have worked with so hard for so long. What is he telling them? But I think they realize that he is way, way out of his depth, that he is incompetent, but also he is somewhat delusional as far as how he views the world and his inability to grasp the reality of the geostrategic situation around the globe today.”
The interview took place as Russia barred entry to at least two U.S. senators planning to participate in a congressional delegation visit next month.
Although Trump announced in August 2018 that Brennan's security clearance was being stripped because of "erratic behavior" that disqualified him from having access to sensitive information, a source told the New York Times in May that the White House never followed through with the complicated bureaucratic process of revocation.

Texto completo: One man wore a white shirt and black trousers, and carried two shopping bags. He stared down a tank.
The other wore shorts and a tank top, and carried a furled umbrella. He stared down a police officer who had a weapon drawn.
The two photos are drawing comparisons as compelling images of outmatched citizens standing up to Chinese authority.
The first photo was taken in Beijing in 1989 during the Tiananmen Square protests, which were brutally quashed by the government. The protester, who quickly became known as Tank Man, captured the world's attention. And the iconic photo has endured 30 years after the Tiananmen crackdown.
The second was taken on Sunday in Hong Kong by a photographer for The New York Times, Lam Yik Fei, as the local police clashed again with protesters in the semiautonomous Chinese territory. The photograph of the protests, now in their third month, has resonated on social media and been shared thousands of times. To many people, the image evokes memories of Tiananmen.
Mr. Lam is one of the few photographers for a Western news outlet who has been covering the protests in Hong Kong from the beginning. He was there when protesters stormed the airport and the train stations, and when they were attacked by mysterious masked men.
David Furst, The Times's international picture editor, said Mr. Lam has deep sources among the protesters, and has followed their movements closely. That shows, he said, in the comprehensive nature of his coverage.
On Sunday, Mr. Lam said, he was just trying to to stay on top of events.
Violence had broken out after a peaceful march, where many protesters carried umbrellas, a symbol of the resistance movement. Hong Kong police officers drew pistols on protesters who were charging them with sticks, and one officer fired a warning shot into the air after another officer fell.
As Mr. Lam looked on, the protester in shorts and a tank top approached one officer and dropped to his knees.
"He said, 'Don't shoot,"' the photographer said.
The officer did not shoot -- but did kick the man in the torso, knocking him over.
The photograph Mr. Lam took was made a moment later, after the protester stood back up and backed away, umbrella in hand.
Mak Chin-ho, the assistant commissioner for police operations, said the officers on the scene "demonstrated great restraint," calling their response necessary and reasonable during a volatile situation in which their lives "were in great danger."
"During that critical moment, this man suddenly appeared in front," he said, referring specifically to the episode in which the officer pointed his weapon at the man with the umbrella. "Understandably, he appeared as a threat."
No one knows what happened to the man who confronted the tank in Tiananmen in 1989. Even his name has remained a mystery, at least to the general public. Some believe that he must have been executed, others that he might have been spared.
The name of the Hong Kong protester is not known, either. But it appears he is still safe. Mr. Lam saw him slip away after the crowd dispersed.
Mr. Lam, a 33-year-old Hong Kong native, said he has photographed worse conflicts elsewhere. But it feels different when it is in one's own home.
"I covered protests in other countries before," he said, "but I never imagined it would happen in Hong Kong."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

After a boy's painful death, she made a comic-book-style funeral program

Texto completo: As soon as she heard that a 4-year-old Baltimore boy had been found in a dumpster, Shawnie O'Neal knew she had to do something.
The West Baltimore native makes her living designing memorial programs, particularly for the untimely deaths wrought by Baltimore's violence. She decided to create a program for Malachi Lawson, a boy who had loved "Paw Patrol" and Mickey Mouse. She would waive the fee she typically charged for her design and printing services, which in this case would be nearly $500. And she definitely was going to have it laminated.
"I didn't want people to throw this away, like they threw him away," she said.
Malachi was burned in a bath and left untreated for nine days before dying in his bed, according to charging documents. His body was found in a dumpster more than 10 miles from home. His mother, Alicia Lawson, and her wife, Shatika Lawson, have been charged with several crimes including involuntary manslaughter and child abuse.
"He had so much courage to even survive all that time," O'Neal, 46, said of Malachi. "I couldn't help him that day, but I could let him know he was appreciated."
At her business, Memorial Programs by Shawnie O. in Franklin Square, the programs don't resemble the templates at most funeral homes. The deceased are depicted on red carpets, surrounded by stars, nestled among twinkling diamonds, or ensconced among pink roses and doves. The custom designs are aimed at creating a lasting memory of the deceased and helping grieving families, O'Neal said.
Personalized funeral touches are a nationwide trend, according to Jack Mitchell, secretary of the National Funeral Directors Association. The Baltimore funeral home owner said the development began with baby boomers and has expanded with millennials.
"We've been seeing a trend of defying what we term as the traditional funeral," Mitchell said. "People want to make it something that's going to be more personal."
With interest in social media and snapping photos continuing to grow, it's no surprise to Mitchell that families are using O'Neal's services.
O'Neal estimates that most programs she creates honor homicide victims - often young men. Baltimore's annual homicide count hasn't dropped below 300 since 2015. The city has already surpassed 215 victims this year.
"It's imperative that people's last thing on Earth be memorable," O'Neal said. "And that's what we're here to do. I want you to dig into a program like it's a New York Times bestseller."
For Malachi's program, O'Neal's vision was a comic book, so mourners could remember the child as powerful and heroic.
Malachi's relatives let O'Neal almost single-handedly design the program, which took eight hours to create and six more to laminate. The more than 100 mourners at the funeral Aug. 13 received a colorful, six-page booklet splashed with photo collages of Malachi, an obituary in "his" words, and comforting lines like "remember an angel never dies" and "heaven is cool."
It included photos of the boy with Alicia and Shatika Lawson, accused in his death. A quotation was attributed to them - taken from a poem O'Neal found that was suggested for children's funerals.
Malachi's relatives provided the photographs. O'Neal said she didn't feel it was her place to exclude Alicia and Shatika.
A member of Malachi's extended family did not immediately respond to a request for comment last week.
In other instances, the bereaved are more specific about what they'd like to see. Regardless, customers always see and approve the final creation before it's printed, O'Neal said.
Nearly 20 years ago, O'Neal was a Baltimore City schoolteacher when her oldest son started playing basketball. She couldn't stand the uniforms, and her son's coach challenged her to improve them. She did - and in the process began to find herself.
The Coppin State graduate quit teaching and started her own business full time in 2004. Originally, she focused on T-shirts. But after she created a funeral program for her grandmother - depicted among flowers - she changed direction.
Since then, she's made thousands of programs. Some showcase photos of the recently deceased on replica covers of a Ravens football program, or Essence, GQ or PlayStation magazines.
O'Neal has three employees. Typically, they'll meet with loved ones, learn about the deceased and gather photos. O'Neal analyzes images and contemplates who the person was. How did they pose? Was there a pattern to what they wore?
While a colleague works on collages and inside pages, O'Neal focuses on the front and back covers. As she searches for the perfect font, her Shih Tzu, August, sits at her feet.
The Sade station on Pandora radio gets O'Neal in the zone. On really hard days, when the grieving families and Baltimore's violence can't escape her thoughts, she listens to gospel.
"Sometimes, I just need to know it's going to be okay," she said.
For Malachi's program, she said, she worked in silence.
Though O'Neal partners with some funeral homes, most of her business is word of mouth.
Rosalind Jones heard about O'Neal in 2012 and asked her to create a program for her father's funeral. Since then, Jones has enlisted O'Neal for four more funeral programs, graduation announcements and party decorations.
"You never get the same thing," Jones said. "It's something that fits the circumstances and fits the person. And it's something that you'll always remember."
Jones, a lifelong West Baltimore resident, has become a friend.
A mother of two sons, 17 and 28, O'Neal can't help but dwell on Baltimore's violence. Sometimes, in her dreams, she envisions losing them.
"I know the death rate has increased because I don't get my days off," she said. Her business averages about 45 programs a month, O'Neal said.
O'Neal's aunt, Serrina Boone, works with her niece and can remember more than once dropping off programs at 1 or 2 in the morning.
"We honor their needs and make sure they're fulfilled," Boone said about the business. "The need is there, and we picked up on that need."
Recently, O'Neal invested in a van for Memorial Programs by Shawnie O. If a family member can't get downtown for a consultation, her team can still provide services.
"You have to meet people where they are," she said. "It's hard to put a price tag on death. But I have the spirit for this."

Texto completo: Dawn Jones has been playing polo for 25 years and wants the world to know what she and the U.S. Polo Association are absolutely certain of: “Women’s polo is ready to explode.”
Jones, a champion polo player and part-time Wellington resident who’s been married since 2001 to actor and avid polo player Tommy Lee Jones, is among the prominent advocates of the sport who are thrilled with the growth of the women’s game.
“A decade ago, female membership in the USPA was 22%. Now it’s 40%,” says Jones.
“Women are the fastest-growing segment of the USPA and really are the future of the sport,” says Brenda Lynn, development director of Museum of Polo & Hall of Fame in Lake Worth.
Jones — who says she learned the game from polo pioneer Sue Sally Hale (mother of the late Sunny Hale — universally regarded as the Babe Ruth of women’s polo) — notes that the quality of women’s play has never been higher.
“The level of horses and horsemanship, the strategies being employed — the female game has evolved to the point where it’s drawing in fans of all ages and backgrounds. It’s become so popular that the best female players are starting to make good livings as professionals.”
That’s a far cry from how women were forced to play the game when it arrived in America in the late 19th century. Back then, when men even deigned to allow women to play the game,
they were forced to ride their horses sidesaddle, lest their delicate lady parts be subjected to undo jostling. Of course, for creating degree of difficulty for female players, this was essentially the polo equivalent of what Ginger Rogers had to do with Fred Astaire: dance backwards and in high heels.
The aforementioned Sue Sally Hale was the one who changed everything. In the 1950s and ’60s, she famously donned a fake mustache and other disguises in order to compete alongside men.
Sally’s daughter Sunny carried a similar polo passion — and even more natural talent. In 2000, Sunny broke the gender barrier, competing alongside the best professional male players on one of the sport’s top professional teams.
Sunny’s stardom set the stage for the 21st century growth of the women’s game.
The contemporary women’s game also has benefited from digital innovation, some of which was spearheaded by Jones. Last year, she helped create and launch the Women’s International Polo Network (wipnpolo.com).
Think of it as a LinkedIn for women’s polo.
“We want it to be the one-stop shop for all things women’s polo: player profiles, tournament information, a calendar of upcoming events and lots of other resources,” Jones explains.
While the polo season in Palm Beach County runs from January to April, the USPA is getting a head start on promoting the 2020 season — and the sport in general.
To coincide with today being Women’s Equality Day — and to celebrate the sport in the epicenter of women’s polo — the USPA, in partnership with the Palm Beach County Tourist Development Council, is debuting a 30-minute documentary called Women in Polo: The Palm Beaches. The informative and inspiring film features both past female polo legends and current and future stars. It will air on the TVG Network over Labor Day weekend, and be available in Palm Beach County hotels and resorts, as well as on ThePalmBeaches.tv and via Roku.
And speaking of Women’s Equality Day...
Women’s Equality Day: The fight continues
Established by the U.S. Congress in 1973 — two years after U.S. Rep. Bella Abzug (D-New York) requested it — Women’s Equality Day commemorates the Aug. 26, 1920 certification of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, which gave women the right to vote.
Ironically — but perhaps not surprisingly — no female leaders of the suffrage movement were permitted to witness U.S. Secretary of State Bainbridge Colby’s signing of the historic proclamation, which he did at 8 a.m. inside his private Washington, D.C. residence. There were no photos taken either.
However, in a New York Times front page story, Colby was quoted: “To the leaders of this great movement I tender my sincere congratulations. To every one, from the president, who uttered the call to duty, whenever the cause seemed to falter, to the humblest worker in this great reform, the praise not only of this generation but of posterity will be freely given.”
How sincere Colby was in his congratulations has been debated by historians.
But one thing that isn’t debatable: Be it suffragettes in the early 20th century or mallet-wielding female polo players competing astride galloping horses — throughout the ages, courageous women have been willing to risk it all to achieve what they value most.

Lisa Page could save Andrew McCabe from DOJ criminal charges

Texto completo: Former FBI lawyer Lisa Page could hinder a criminal case against former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe if the Justice Department decides to bring charges against him.
Federal prosecutors are close to making a final decision on whether to indict McCabe, who is accused of lying to federal agents, the New York Times reported Monday.
McCabe’s lawyers met with Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, who will help make the call on whether to prosecute, and U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia Jessie Liu in two separate meetings last week. This signals McCabe’s lawyers could be making a last-ditch effort to convince the top law enforcement officials not to prosecute the case.
If they were to bring charges against McCabe, prosecutors would have to prove he knowingly and intentionally lied to investigators when he told them on two occasions that he did not remember authorizing Page to speak to a Wall Street Journal reporter. McCabe corrected himself at a later time.
Page, who worked as a special counsel to McCabe, told a grand jury in Washington, D.C., that McCabe was authorized in his position as deputy director to give information to the media and had no motive to lie. Page resigned from the bureau last year after it was discovered she had exchanged anti-Trump text messages with former FBI agent Peter Strzok, with whom she had an affair.
Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired McCabe in March 2018, less than two days before he was set to retire. This followed Michael Horowitz, DOJ’s inspector general, releasing a report in February 2018 detailing instances where McCabe “lacked candor” with then-FBI Director James Comey and investigators and concluded McCabe greenlit disclosures to the media of sensitive information on an FBI investigation into the Clinton Foundation “to make himself look good.”
McCabe's lawyers called the inspector general's report "deeply flawed."
Comey has said he did not give McCabe permission to leak, and when Sessions fired McCabe he stated the deputy director “made an unauthorized disclosure to the news media and lacked candor — including under oath — on multiple occasions.”
McCabe, who was hired by CNN last week, sued in August, accusing Trump of forcing his subordinates at the Justice Department to participate in an “unconstitutional plan and scheme” to have him fired, and is demanding back pay, his full pension, and for his record to be expunged. Trump has accused McCabe, who authorized the investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia, of being involved in an "illegal and treasonous" plot against him.
Neither DOJ nor McCabe’s attorney immediately responded to the Washington Examiner’s requests for comment.
The investigation into McCabe has been lengthy — so long, in fact, the Times reported the term expired for grand jury hearing evidence. It began last year after Horowitz referred his findings to the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington for possible criminal charges. Frustrated with the prolonged process, DOJ prosecutor Kamil Shields left the case and joined a private practice. Another assistant U.S. attorney, David Kent, is also no longer on the case.
McCabe is also likely still being scrutinized in Horowitz’s inquiry into allegations of abuse of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The surveillance warrant applications targeting Trump associate Carter Page required the approval of top members of the FBI and DOJ, and McCabe was involved in the FISA approval process.
Horowitz’s report is expected to be released to the public in late September or early October.

Texto completo: Two years after Hurricane Irma slammed through South Florida, killing scores of people and knocking out power to three-quarters of the state, four nursing home workers are facing aggravated manslaughter and other charges in the deaths of 12 residents felled by the searing heat the storm left behind.
Arrest warrants were issued Monday for three nurses and an administrator at the since-shuttered Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hills, about 20 miles north of Miami.
Operators of the center failed to evacuate for three days despite a lack of air conditioning that caused temperatures in the building to soar, authorities say.

"I'm glad these individuals are being held accountable after their inexplicable failure to call 911 when people were in need," said Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla. , who was the governor at the time. "The individuals responsible for these senseless deaths must be brought to justice. "
Defense lawyers said two nurses and the administrator who worked at the center when the storm roared through south Florida turned themselves in. The status of a third nurse linked to the case was not immediately clear, the lawyers said.
Lawrence Hashish, a lawyer for one of the nurses, told the South Florida Sun Sentinel that those facing charges are scapegoats.
“They weren’t the decision-makers,” Hashish said. “For the police, they were the low-hanging fruit. ”
Jim Cobb, who represents former administrator Jorge Caballo, said Caballo was told before the storm that administrators could call Scott's cellphone for help if needed. They called five times, Cobb said.
The administrators “sat there languishing waiting for the cavalry to come," Cobb said. "They never, ever came. ”
It was not immediately clear what the charges were. David Frankel, a lawyer for one of the nurses, told The New York Times he expected his client would face 12 counts of manslaughter.

Hurricane Irma devastated parts of the Caribbean and Florida during a brutal, two-week march directly blamed for more than 80 deaths across Florida. Irma slammed into Florida Sept. 10, 2017, as a Category 4 hurricane with 130-mph winds and driving rain. Some areas of the state remained without power for weeks.
Three days after the outage, following numerous 911 calls, the nursing home was finally evacuated. The home's license was suspended a short time later. Attorney David Frankel, who represents the lead nurse, said the defendants did everything to keep the patients cool and hydrated.
Still, 12 of 14 deaths at the center were ruled homicides. Federal, state and local authorities opened investigations in the days after the deaths, but no charges had been filed.

More than 115 people were evacuated from the nursing home, some in critical condition. Three people were found dead at the scene, one died during the evacuation, four were pronounced dead at a hospital. The others succumbed in the days and weeks that followed.
Paramedics from Hollywood Fire Rescue, during an ill-fated effort by the facility to regain licensing in February 2018, testified to stifling heat at the nursing home in the days following the storm. Investigators said the center delayed the evacuation decision even though a fully functional hospital was across the street.
Hashish said his client works as a full-time nurse at another facility and was picking up a shift that day in September 2017.
"They called her. They said, 'can you come and help? We're short-handed,' and look what she walked into," he said.
The tragedy made national headlines, and lawmakers ultimately passed a bill requiring backup power sources in Florida nursing homes and assisted living facilities. The legislation requires such facilities to have a generator capable of keeping nursing homes and assisted living facilities at 81 degrees Fahrenheit or lower for at least four days.
"We took steps in Florida to protect our most vulnerable," Scott said. "To ensure a tragedy like this never happens again. "

Forest Elephants Defend Against Climate Change, But They’re Almost Gone

Texto completo: Poaching destabilizes nations, disrupts ecosystems and threatens biodiversity. A recent study suggests still another consequence: Some types of poaching may also accelerate climate change.
Forest elephants - the smaller, endangered relatives of African savanna elephants - promote the growth of large trees that excel at storing carbon, according to research published in the journal Nature Geoscience.
Should forest elephants disappear, scientists estimated, Central Africa’s rainforest will lose about 3 billion tons of carbon - the equivalent of France’s total CO2 emissions for 27 years.
“This new paper points to something that we in Central Africa have suspected for a long time, but now this group has thrown some serious science at the issue,” said Fiona Maisels, a conservation scientist at the Wildlife Conservation Society and at the University of Stirling in Scotland.
“With the loss of forest elephants,” she added, “loss of carbon stocks can be added to the list of ecosystem services that are no longer provided by these animals.”
Over recent years, researchers have gained a more detailed understanding of the links between animals and climate. Wild grazers, for instance, can reduce the intensity and frequency of fires that emit greenhouse gases. Methane emissions from livestock significantly contribute to global warming.
Big difference
Scientists have also known for decades that large herbivores such as elephants play important short-term roles in ecosystems by promoting biodiversity, recycling nutrients and dispersing seeds.
Fabio Berzaghi, an ecologist at the Laboratory of Climate and Environmental Sciences in France and the lead author of the new study, suspected that elephants might also play a profound long-term role in shaping Africa’s rainforest, second in size only to the Amazon’s.
The Amazon lost its large herbivores 12,000 years ago, among them ground sloths that weighed over 3 tons, elephantlike creatures called gomphotheres and armadillolike glyptodonts that were the size of small cars.
The loss of these and other large herbivores likely contributed to the Amazon’s higher density of smaller trees, with a lower overall amount of vegetation compared with Africa’s rainforest.
“We were thinking elephants may play a role in the differences between these two continents’ forests,” Berzaghi said. “We also really wanted to know what the long-term consequences of losing this species would be.”
Berzaghi and his colleagues selected two field sites. One lies in the Democratic Republic of Congo, from which elephants disappeared 30 years ago because of poaching; the other is the Republic of Congo, where elephants lived at high numbers until recently.
Both sites were relatively pristine and differed only in the presence or absence of elephants. The researchers measured the trunk size of all the trees in the study areas and noted the species, giving them an idea of the short-term effects of elephant loss.
To determine the long-term effects, they created a computer model that simulated the basic functions of the African rainforest, including tree growth and death, competition, photosynthesis and reproduction. The model allowed them to include or exclude elephants.
Forest elephants almost exclusively stomp down trees with a diameter of 12 inches or less, and they prefer to eat fast-growing softwood trees. By clearing the understory of vegetation, the researchers found, elephants not only alter plant composition but also affect light penetration and water availability.
This results in an ecosystem that favors large, slow-growing hardwood trees. Such species store significantly more carbon than the equivalent volume of smaller softwood trees.
“As a tree, there’s a trade-off - you can’t have it all,” Berzaghi said. “You either invest in growing fast or in building a lot of structure with carbon to be more resistant.”
Valuable service
Extrapolating their findings to the whole of Africa’s rainforest, Berzaghi and his colleagues found that the disappearance of elephants would result in a 7% loss of vegetation - the equivalent of 3 billion tons of carbon storage.
Put another way, elephants provide a carbon storage service valued at $43 billion.
“This is the first study I have seen attributing large, multimegaton changes in carbon to a particular species,” said Rosie Fisher, a scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado, who was not involved in the research. “It really opens a new frontier in how we think about interactions between large animals and carbon storage.”
Save for a few surviving populations, forest elephants are functionally extinct in almost all of their former 850,000-square-mile habitat. The species declined by 62% from 2002 to 2011, Maisels and her colleagues found, and poaching has largely continued unchecked since then.
According to Iain Douglas-Hamilton, founder of Save the Elephants, a conservation organization based in Kenya, the killing has most recently spread to Gabon, which holds half of the world’s remaining forest elephants and was previously protected from poaching by its relative isolation.
“This study comes at a time when forest elephants are threatened as never before,” Douglas-Hamilton said. “It is appalling that just as we are beginning to understand how elephants might have a key role in Africa in sequestering carbon, they are under real threat of eradication.”
One limitation of the study, Berzaghi said, is that we do not know how much carbon has already been lost because of the elephants’ decline. But it does seem certain, he added, that putting a stop to poaching and restoring forest elephant populations would bring climate benefits.

Dems turn to their comfort zone: race

Texto completo: What was the embittered left - Democratic presidential candidates and their media allies - supposed to do when their hopes of Russia-Trump collusion crashed on the boulevard of broken dreams?
Pivot.
They had invested so much in their fantasy that President Donald Trump was a treasonous agent of Russian boss Vladimir Putin. But when special counsel Robert Mueller's report came out, and there was no collusion, no crime charged, their fantasy collapsed.
And so, after a brief spasm of despair, the left pivoted to their default position: race.
With Americans working and with money in their pockets again, with the 2020 election approaching, Democrats are reaching for the race card the way a sick man reaches for the waters of Lourdes. Desperately. Their allies in media followed suit, with President Trump called everything from a white supremacist to a Nazi, and on and on.
Meanwhile, the New York Times embarks on an ambitious new series, the 1619 Project - marking the 400th anniversary of the first slave ships to our shores.
The newspaper said it hopes "to reframe the country's history, understanding 1619 as our true founding, and placing the consequences of slavery and the contributions of black Americans at the very center of the story we tell ourselves about who we are."
NYT editor Dean Baquet, a former colleague of mine at the Chicago Tribune, a thoughtful man now with his newsroom in turmoil, expressed the pivot in a different way. In terms of Mr. Mueller.
In a transcript of a newsroom meeting with his liberal staff that made its way to Slate, Mr. Baquet said this:
"The day Bob Mueller walked off that witness stand, two things happened. Our readers who want Donald Trump to go away suddenly thought, 'Holy s--, Bob Mueller is not going to do it.' And Donald Trump got a little emboldened politically, I think. Because, you know, for obvious reasons. And I think that the story changed. A lot of the stuff we're talking about started to emerge like six or seven weeks ago. We're a little tiny bit flat-footed. I mean, that's what happens when a story looks a certain way for two years. Right?" So the Times pivoted.
The story of slavery in America is compelling and worthy of such attention. But reducing the whole of America to the sin of slavery and racism that America has tried so hard to reject - by shedding blood in the Civil War, by passing the Civil Rights Act, by twice electing Barack Obama to the White House - is absurd. But revealing.
The short-term benefits of defining America by race may help Democrats and soothe subscribers at the New York Times. But what it does long term, to journalism, to the republic, doesn't concern the left, just as it doesn't concern Mr. Trump. He's not introspective. An introspective man couldn't, wouldn't have said some of the things he's said. He's a purely transactional politician, as cynical as his opponents.
In the short term, Democrats and their media allies are using race and charges of "white supremacy" to herd those 60 million or so Trump voters back into Hillary Clinton's basket of deplorables. But once you brand 60 million people as "white supremacists" and "Nazis," what can you do with them? If Democrats win in 2020, will Trump voters be welcomed back into some brave new Trumpless America? Will the left open its arms and call them brothers and sisters on the condition they agree to kneel like penitent sinners and burn their MAGA hats in ceremonies of public redemption? No. It doesn't work like that.
Recently, two presidential candidates, Sens. Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren, reminded their faithful that Michael Brown, a black man of Ferguson, Mo., was "murdered" by a white cop. Ferguson erupted in riots after Brown's death.
Senators Warren and Harris are both lawyers. They know that the Obama Justice Department tried mightily, but did not, could not find that Brown had been murdered. But they incite anyway. Because they want to win.
The American political media, relentless in ferreting out even a whiff of suspected racism among conservatives, largely gave them a pass. According to PolitiFact, a liberal standard of truth, their use of "murder" was problematic, but not a lie. PolitiFact said that because "the significance of Harris' and Warren's use of the word (murder) is open to some dispute, we won't be rating their tweets on the Truth-O-Meter."
Of course not.

Honolulu Museum of Art exhibit displays painter Li Huayi’s unique vision

Texto completo: When Shawn Eichman, curator of Asian art at the Hono­lulu Museum of Art, would talk to his board and benefactors about his plans to bring the work of painter Li Huayi here, he would often get comments and questions like: What is his art like? Can you tell us about it?
His response: “Just look at it.”
That is by far the best advice to follow when entering the exhibition, “Contemporary Landscapes: Li Huayi,” which opened this weekend. No matter one’s taste in art, it is certain to be one of the most gratifying and exhilarating experiences one can get from the simple act of looking at paintings.
The exhibition comprises 33 works, dating from 1993 to 2017, by Li, a Chinese-born painter now based in San Francisco and Beijing who has been called a “towering genius” of contemporary art. “That’s not just Chinese art, just a towering genius of the art world,” Eichman said.
The exhibition took Eichman eight years to organize, with works coming from private collectors in Taiwan, Hong Kong, China and several U.S. mainland cities. The Honolulu museum also has one Li work, a landscape portraying a murmuring river flowing through a shadowy canyon. Otherwise, “a lot of this has never been seen in public before,” Eichman said.
Most of the paintings are mysterious, somewhat brooding landscapes, reminiscent of traditional Chinese landscape painting but in other ways fantastical and otherworldly, as if they were scenes from a Gothic “Dungeons & Dragons” movie. A few others are still lifes of gnarled pine trees, bamboo and rock, providing a more intimate look at Li’s work.
The images amaze and startle on many levels. From a technical standpoint, the brushwork, akin to the finely controlled strokes derived from Chinese calligraphy, combined with broad washes, splatters and pours in the style of Jackson Pollock, seems incredibly detailed and painstakingly labor-intensive. Eichman said Li often takes a year to create a work.
The size and impact of his paintings are similarly impressive, of such majestic scale that Eichman decided to display them individually, one per wall, to avoid visual clutter. One piece, “Fuchun Mountain,” an homage to a famous Chinese landscape painting, stretches nearly 24 feet in length.
Many observers consider Li’s work to be a fusion of Eastern and Western styles, as seen in his use of Chinese brush painting, yet with a creative use of shadow and light to create a sense of perspective unusual in Asian painting but commonplace in Western painting.
As is common in traditional Chinese brush painting, Li will also leave some of the canvas unpainted, leaving white space to depict water or sky, but with remarkable effect. Eichman said an acquaintance of his, upon seeing Li’s “Sound of Waterfalls,” commented: “This is the first painting where I’ve actually heard the water.”
“There is something very musical about (Li’s paintings),” Eichman said. “When he paints he actually listens to classical music, particularly romantic music like Beethoven and Schubert.”
Li’s life story reflects the melding and mashing of cultures revealed in his art. Born into a well-to-do family in Shanghai in 1948, just before the Communist takeover of China, he was trained in traditional Chinese culture as a youth, which included painting. With Shanghai being the most cosmopolitan city in China, he was exposed to Western art and culture as well.
As his talent emerged and the politics of China became more and more ideological, Li was chosen to serve as a propaganda artist, painting images extolling the Communist Party during China’s Cultural Revolution. At the same time, his privileges as an artist enabled him to sequester himself away in libraries full of foreign books, ostensibly to learn about the dangers of “decadent” Western art and culture.
Instead, from reading works like “The Catcher in the Rye” and “On the Road,” Li learned about freedom and independent thought, which would have been taboo for the proletariat masses of China.
“He had this self-taught exposure that was all very dangerous and had to be kept very private and very quiet, and throughout this entire time he was trying to develop his own voice as an artist,” Eichman said.
Li emigrated to the West with his wife’s family in 1981 and studied abstract expressionism at the Academy of Art University in San Francisco. Amid a bevy of Chinese artists trying to take advantage of China’s opening to the West and cater to Western tastes, he initially struggled to make a name for himself.
“When he first came to the United States he was working as a stock boy in a grocery store doing paintings in the middle of the night,” Eichman said. “One of the things that makes him so remarkable is that he had such a powerful vision for what he was doing that he didn’t bend to market influences at a time when everyone that was coming out of China was very much targeting the kind of art that would sell in the auctions and galleries in New York.”
Li’s first solo exhibition was in Southern California in 1984, and since then he’s been exhibited around the world. A 2007 exhibition in London heralded his arrival as a major artistic figure when New York Times art critic Souren Melikian described him as a “towering genius of 21st century art” and called the show “one of those miracles one hopes for without really believing that they can happen.”
Eichman feared that as Li grew in acclaim, the possibility of bringing his work to Honolulu was becoming more and more remote. Fortunately, Li was familiar with the museum’s Chinese art catalogue and lent his support to the exhibition, which opened this weekend and runs through Jan. 5.
Eichman sees the show as a continuation of the Honolulu museum’s tradition of showcasing Asian art, but added that Li’s work is so uniquely his own that it transcends the notion of representing a particular culture or historical perspective.
“We were looking for a style of contemporary art that could not just come out of a vacuum but could speak to our traditional strengths,” Eichman said. “At the same time it provided a new perspective on those strengths that would lead us into contemporary art.”

Texto completo: I don't watch much TV but on vacation, I had the opportunity to see Maury ("The Maury Povich Show"), several confrontational "court" shows, and Dr. Phil.
Do you wonder why so many people are comfortable with the confrontational, often insulting, belittling, uncivil, and bullying political behavior coming out of Washington, FOX, many members of Congress and other politicians?
I also wonder about violence, to me the ultimate incivility. "The Walking Dead" offers some sobering thoughts, namely the acceptability of unprecedented gore and gratuitous violence against the living dead. By dehumanizing people into zombies, this brutality is OK. I'm thinking, "These people have a serious health problem and need some major medical attention!"
Rudeness and total incivility are entertainment with very high ratings. I watched a brother insulting his sister and screaming that her "husband" is not the father of her child and coming to near blows (Maury) or a daughter who bullies to tears, insults, and dominates her desperate mother (Dr. Phil). It was gripping. If instead you had a show where a brother says nice things about his sibs and a daughter who is a model of affection, respect, and love, what would the ratings be?
Maury has had 6,000 episodes at one count. Dr. Phil topped the talk-show ratings for 150 weeks in a row.
Maury, Doc Phil and others of the genre make the vile politics of Washington and many state capitals seem mild.
I assume that the millions of viewers of these pop culture icons of yuck are grateful that no "guests" on these shows are running for and winning office!
By the way, the Showtime series "Shameless" may be entertaining if you like a program that, "... finds new ways of crossing the boundaries of human decency ... Used tampons, human feces, expletives, incest and even a toddler snorting cocaine ... are common scenes," according to TheMediaOnline.
As we hope for civility in America, we must accept the fact that cage fighting is much more entertaining than cricket.
When politicians are discovered to have sexual preferences that are not widely sanctioned, we may recall we were being told back in 2008 (New York Times, "Hopelessly Devoted to You, You, and You") that pansexuality, omnisexuality, polysexuality, bicurious, polyamorous, and other sexualities were part of the acceptable choices. It's a whole new world for the millions of Americans who are "traditional" and may not understand any of these terms or know how to place them in a political context.
One student asked me if maybe President Trump was polyamorous and having relationships with other women, in which case, she said, he's pretty much a "modern man." Polyamorous people "... talk openly with their partners about having or having the desire to have sexual and/or emotional relationships with multiple people and often set ground rules for their relationships. Polyamorous people can be in relationships with monogamous people," as stated on the definitive site on these matters, REFINERY29.
Many of the pop culture manifestations described above inevitably slid from the entertainment column of media to the news and actual behavior ledger. So, in 2019, it is said that we are becoming immune to the shenanigans of politicians and disregarding much of the non-civil behavior as long as they deliver what we most want. That can be a better economy, an end to abortions, border control and a stop to the watering-down of American "culture," wide-open immigration and diversity, free health care and college tuition, no restrictions or sharp controls on guns, less regulation or much more climate change-prevention restrictions, among other things.
Sadly it seems that "civility" however defined, is not the most valuable coin in the political realm. A crude and often "shock-style" popular culture may be contributing a lot to the "cheapening" of our political expectations. "Are there no taboos left on TV anymore?" asks Nikki Temkin of TheMediaOnline.
We can ask: "Are there no taboos left in politics?"

A Backlash Over 1,800 Rounds of Tear Gas

Texto completo: The Hong Kong police have fired more than 1,800 rounds of tear gas as the mass protests gripping the city have become increasingly fraught.
Experts who reviewed videos for The New York Times said the police had repeatedly violated standards for safely dispersing crowds, putting protesters and bystanders in serious danger.
The Hong Kong police have defended their use of tear gas, saying the protests have become more violent in recent weeks, with demonstrators embracing more aggressive tactics. Activists have thrown bricks, blocked streets and set fires.
The police say they have acted with restraint. Often, they hold up large banners warning the crowds about tear gas before they fire. But a Times review of dozens of episodes involving tear gas show the police, at times, have used methods that experts describe as indiscriminate and excessive. Many recordings show officers deploying tear gas against crowds that appeared nonviolent and that were not attacking the police.
"This is ridiculous," said Jim Bueermann, former president of the Police Foundation in Washington, referring to a video that appeared to show tear gas being fired off an office tower.
"I would find this to be completely unacceptable under American standards," added Mr. Bueermann, a former police chief who advises law enforcement agencies. "You are now taking a less-lethal tool, the tear gas, and making it a potentially lethal object."
Around the world, tear gas has long been a means to control riots and civilian protests. If used appropriately, it drives people to flee the gas, which irritates their eyes, skin and lungs without causing serious, long-term injuries in most people. Experts say officers should fire tear-gas canisters a short distance toward the edges of a crowd.
But law enforcement officers at times ignore those guidelines, leading to debilitating injuries, as has happened at protests in South Korea, Bahrain and Turkey.
Most injuries from the use of tear gas in Hong Kong have been minor. Groups have begun documenting health issues like prolonged coughing, skin blisters and diarrhea. Bystanders with no protective gear, including children, have been seen getting caught in tear gas.
Experts reviewing the videos of episodes in various neighborhoods described several ways in which the officers' methods could have been dangerous.
Using Tear Gas Indoors
Tear gas is a nonlethal chemical when used appropriately. It spreads quickly over a wide area, limiting exposure to individuals. Experts and tear-gas manufacturers warn against using it indoors, where higher concentrations of the chemical can become trapped, and people may not be able to escape.
Two weeks ago, after an hourslong standoff with the police in the Kwai Fong area of Hong Kong, antigovernment protesters retreated to a subway station.
Using tear gas inside is dangerous, whatever the reason, experts said.
"Discharging indoors leads to panic, can lead to stampede, and at its worst it can lead to dire health consequences, including death, if people cannot escape the suffocating effects of the gas," said Michael Power, a civil rights lawyer based in South Africa who specializes in protests and policing.
Mr. Bueermann, the former police chief, said it was dangerous to fire tear gas into an area with limited visibility because people could be hit.
"In this case, it's very clear they can't see very well in that area because of the concentration of tear gas," he said. "You don't fire any kind of a weapon into an area that you cannot see what your target is."
The police initially denied using tear gas in the train station, according to I-Cable News, a local TV station. But later, the police acknowledged that they had fired tear gas.
Firing From High Above
In several cases, the Hong Kong police have shot tear gas from their perches above the crowds.
Earlier this month, thousands of protesters gathered outside the government headquarters as part of a general strike across Hong Kong. The demonstration was considered an unlawful assembly because it expanded beyond what was authorized by the city.
Multiple videos from that day showed tear gas falling from the sky into crowds of protesters. The officers' exact position was unclear, but the rounds' trajectories suggest that the police were stationed on a building high above.
Shooting from such a position is reckless, Mr. Bueermann said, because the tear-gas canisters fall to the ground at a high speed. Most of the canisters collected by protesters have been six-inch-round metal shells.
"I have never seen that before," he said. "I think that is hugely problematic. If it hits someone in the head, you could kill them."
From a distance, the police also lack a complete understanding of the protesters' actions, said Dr. Rohini J. Haar, an adviser at Physicians for Human Rights, an advocacy group. "At such a height, they may not be able to discern whether protesters have become threatening."
Firing at People
Experts say that most injuries from tear gas are blunt-force trauma caused by a canister. A freelance filmmaker, Ryan Lai, was filming protests outside a police station in Sham Shui Po.
Gijsbert Heikamp was filming with his cellphone at a protest outside a police station in Tsim Sha Tsui. He was standing behind a barrier when officers began firing tear gas from behind a fence.
Indiscriminate Use
The police have fired tear gas at crowds from far away and from partly hidden positions. The tactic is considered inappropriate, because the crowds are not given sufficient warning and the police do not have a full view of the environment.
As a large number of protesters gathered outside a police station in Sham Shui Po one night, the police fired tear gas from inside the station's gates. The use of tear gas caught many by surprise.
When the tear gas was lobbed over the outer wall of the police station, the police did not appear to have a specific target or purpose, and it haphazardly hit the crowd.
"Why is it that the police, who seem to be comfortably protected in the police station, are seeking to call for dispersal?" Mr. Power said.
A second and third round of tear gas also seemed to go too far, the experts said. "If people are leaving, and that was your intent, then stop using it," Mr. Bueermann said.
The more tear gas is used, the harder it can be for people to leave.
"If you don't give them enough warning, if you don't give them a place to go, if you use too much gas, if you charge them too soon, all of those things can be counterproductive of the primary goal of dispersing the crowd," said Mr. Bueermann.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: Headnote Western Journal amplifies claims of bias from Big Tech
It may not be a household name, but few publications have had the reach, and potentially the influence, in U.S. politics as The Western Journal.
Even the right-wing web publication's audience of more than 36 million people, eclipsing many of the nation's largest news organizations, doesn't know much about the company or who's behind it.
In a New York Times investigation, Nicholas Confessore and Justin Bank found that the site, which stokes outrage and curates a narrative in which conservatives and their values ' are under constant assault, is caught in a high-stakes clash between Silicon Valley and Washington.
The site has struggled to maintain its audience through Facebook's and Google's algorithmic changes aimed at reducing disinformation - actions the site's leaders see as evidence of political bias.
Here's what the Times reporters learned.
Western Journal's audience is huge but precarious
The publication does almost no original reporting, instead repackaging stories found elsewhere that fit into right-wing narratives chosen by the site's editors. After an editor finds a worthy story, it is handed off to a pool of contract writers who typically have 30 minutes to write a story. Most work remotely.
It was a model that worked strikingly well - for a while. In the three years ending in March, Western Journal posts on Facebook earned three-quarters of a billion shares, likes and comments, nearly as many as the combined tally of 10 leading U.S. news organizations.
But each of the tech giants began limiting its reach. Google News blacklisted it for what it considered deceptive business practices, Apple News followed after saying it produced stories that promoted "views overwhelmingly rejected by the scientific community," and Facebook downgraded The Western Journal after it was repeatedly dinged on fact-checking sites.
Its founder has a history of divisive politics
Floyd G. Brown, who founded the site, is a political activist who has chosen writing as his weapon. He began his career with the race-baiting "Willie Horton" ad during the 1988 presidential campaign, which used mug shots of a Black convicted murderer to stoke fears that the Democratic candidate, Michael Dukakis, was soft on crime.
In the 1990s, he peddled opposition research and conspiracy theories about Bill Clinton. In the 2000s, he helped form a network of political action committees that made ads attacking Barack Obama, including one that questioned whether Obama was a secret Muslim.
The company also has unusually close ties with a pro-Trump PAC, America Fighting Back. Brown is the PAC's chairman.
Brown's son Patrick served as chief executive of the site until he stepped down in August to take a medical leave. Early in his publishing career, Patrick Brown initially focused on uplifting and nonpolitical stories but eventually adopted a right-wing focus.
The site has amplified claims of political bias in Big Tech
The Western Journal's leaders didn't buy explanations from the technology companies on why the publication had been downgraded or suspended, echoing the common complaint in conservative media that Big Tech was biased against them.
To cope with the changes, it began, in the words of Patrick Brown, "backing into something that looks more like a traditional media company." It launched a corrections page and hired copy editors with traditional journalism training. It removed thousands of old stories, published editorial standards and renamed its army of related Face-book pages to tie them to a single brand.
It has now rebounded but is about half its prior size. Later this year, the Browns will release a smartphone app intended to sidestep the gatekeeping of Big Tech.

"While I believe that I did what was necessary for the good of the country, for the good of the firm, I am in the sad position of having to sever ties with Overstock. com, both as CEO and board member," wrote Byrne in a statement.
In 1999, Byrne founded Overstock. com, which has since grown into a $2 billion business, according to a bio on the company's website.
Here's what we know so far about Byrne's resignation:
Why is he resigning?
In his statement, Byrne cites his involvement in "certain government matters" for his resignation. The company statement did not elaborate on details of the government matters Byrne referenced.
What's this about the 'deep state'?
On August 12, Overstock. com issued a press release titled "Overstock. com CEO Comments on Deep State, Withholds Further Comment," during which Byrne said he somehow became involved in the "Clinton investigation" and the "Russian investigation" starting in 2015. He also discusses helping "the Men in Black," which he says he had done previously to help in the case of a friend who was murdered and to "shake up Wall Street" a decade ago.
"Unfortunately, this third time turned out to be less about law enforcement and more about political espionage conducted against Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump (and to a lesser degree, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz)," Byrne said.
Overstock. com’s shares fell 36% in the two days after the statement was made public.
Overstock CEO steps down: Resignation comes after statement about 'Deep State,' and investigations of Trump, Clinton
How is Maria Butina involved?
According to The New York Times, which interviewed Byrne, the Overstock. com CEO had become romantically involved with Butina, who was sentenced in April to 18 months in prison for participating in a Russian effort to infiltrate U. S. political organizations. Robert Driscoll, Butina's lawyer, confirmed to the Times the two were romantically involved.
In an interview with CNN, Byrne claims he was directed by the FBI to pursue a romantic relationship with Butina ahead of the 2016 election.
CNN reports no agencies have verified his claims, and neither the FBI nor Justice Department would comment. In his August 12 statement, Byrne mentions presenting information to the Justice Department in April.
What's next for Overstock. com?
Jonathan Johnson, who has worked with Overstock. com for nearly 17 years and serves on its board, was appointed interim CEO. "It will be my mission as I take the helm to continue and build on Overstock’s achievements and success," said Johnson in a statement. Overstock. com did not provide information on a search for a permanent CEO.

Texto completo: A previously unknown outbreak of the Zika virus swept across Cuba in 2017, a year after the global health emergency was declared over, scientists reported on Thursday.
Until now, the Pan American Health Organization had no record of any Zika infection in Cuba in 2017, much less an outbreak. Following inquiries by The New York Times about the new study, published in the journal Cell, officials acknowledged that they had failed to tally 1,384 cases reported by Cuban officials that year.
That figure is a sharp increase over the 187 cases confirmed in 2016 and is "in line with the estimates for 2017 from our own study," said Kristian Andersen, an infectious disease researcher at Scripps Research Translational Institute in La Jolla, Calif., and a co-author of the new study.
Because most cases of Zika go unconfirmed, Dr. Andersen added, the outbreak actually may have comprised tens of thousands of infections.
Cuba saw record tourism in 2017, raising the possibility that many travelers were unknowingly exposed. Some 4.7 million foreign visitors arrived that year, an increase of 16 percent over 2016. More than one million were Canadians.
"If we want to stay ahead of communicable diseases, we need to know where they are and how many cases are occurring," said Jennifer Gardy of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in Seattle. "For some diseases in some settings, this is pretty straightforward. For others, like Zika, it isn't."
Officials at P.A.H.O., an arm of the World Health Organization, blamed the failure to publish timely data on the Cuba outbreak on a "technical glitch." The information was held in a database, they said, but not visible on the website. By Thursday afternoon, the website had been updated.
Dr. Andersen and his colleagues began tracking Zika's spread when the mosquito-borne virus first appeared in the Americas in 2015. The epidemic first came to light in Brazil, where babies of some infected mothers were born with severe brain damage. The virus spread swiftly to neighboring countries.
Dr. Andersen and his colleagues collected blood from people infected with the virus. The researchers plucked the virus's genetic material from the samples and used mutations in the DNA to estimate the timing of Zika's spread.
Before Zika was identified in Brazil, the scientists discovered, it had been quietly circulating in the country for over a year. "And by that time, it had spread across all the Americas," Dr. Andersen said.
Even in Florida, where the state government keeps careful tabs on new outbreaks, Zika arrived three months before it was detected, the scientists learned.
In November 2016, the World Health Organization announced that the epidemic was no longer a global public health emergency. "But we sat here with this question," Dr. Andersen recalled. "Is it really over?"

The scientists continued tracking the Zika virus across the Americas. They reviewed data on local outbreaks that countries reported to P.A.H.O. They also tallied confirmed cases of Zika in travelers coming home to Florida.
Across the Americas, both sets of statistics told the same story: The number of Zika cases crashed toward the end of 2016 and remained low afterward. But there was one glaring exception in the data.
In 2016, only a few people returning to Florida from Cuba were infected with Zika. In 2017, however, Cuba accounted for 98 percent of the travel-associated Zika cases in Florida.
This was an unexpected finding. Cuba has a sophisticated public health system, and it had seemed to be winning the war against Zika, apparently avoiding the outbreaks seen on other Caribbean islands.
To see if the initial results held up, Dr. Andersen and his colleagues turned to public health data in Europe and discovered a similar pattern among visitors to Cuba. The team developed a statistical model to predict the size of a Zika outbreak in a country, based on the number of travelers who went to Cuba and came back sick.
They concluded that Cuba's outbreak in 2017 was "the same size as on other Caribbean islands, meaning thousands of reported cases," Dr. Andersen said. But because reported cases typically comprise about 10 percent of a given outbreak, "we're actually talking about tens of thousands of cases."
The researchers also examined blood samples from travelers to Cuba to learn the history of the outbreak and determined that the virus appeared in Cuba in the summer of 2016. There was no Patient Zero; instead, Zika arrived several times from other islands. Then it smoldered, as it had elsewhere, for a year.
Dr. Andersen suspects that Cuba's aggressive mosquito control and disease surveillance held back the virus while it raged elsewhere in 2016. Other mosquito-borne viruses, such as dengue, were also surging through the Caribbean, but Cuba didn't see many cases of those, either.
But after the global emergency was called off, Zika gained momentum in Cuba in 2017, the researchers speculated.
"It is easy to miss an outbreak," said Dr. Ester Sabino, the director of the Institute of Tropical Medicine at the University of São Paulo in Brazil, who was not involved in the new study. Many people infected with Zika don't feel any symptoms, while some suffer only a mild fever for a few days.
It is rare in many Latin American countries for an infection to be confirmed with a sophisticated genetic test, Dr. Sabino said. The methods used by Dr. Andersen's team were "a smart way to do world surveillance" for diseases like Zika, she added.
Dr. Andersen said that the new study adds to the evidence that public health workers should look for signs of outbreaks earlier.
"In many of these cases, we wait until we see weird symptoms and diseases in patients, and then we realize we have an outbreak," he said. "If we look at the mosquitoes, we could detect it much earlier."

This Pop Classic Is Still Smoking

Texto completo: A brash bumpkin from the countryside comes to the city, dreaming of stardom. He cuts a record, gets ripped off, turns to trafficking drugs, is betrayed, and dies a folk hero at the hands of the police as his song becomes an anthem.
"The Harder They Come," currently being revived at BAM Rose Cinemas and Metrograph, is a universal story set in a highly specific milieu. Powered by one of the most infectious scores in the history of cinema, it is also a pop classic -- the movie that brought reggae to America and "launched a thousand spliffs," as the New York Times critic Ben Brantley joked in a 2008 review of a theatrical version in London.
Inspired by the life of the Jamaican outlaw Ivanhoe "Rhygin" Martin, credited with the line that gives the movie its title, "The Harder They Come" was a vehicle for the reggae star Jimmy Cliff. It was independent Jamaica's first homemade feature, as well as the first film directed by Perry Henzell, a scion of that nation's white planter class. The distinguished black playwright Trevor Rhone co-wrote the script. ("The Harder They Come" is being shown in conjunction with the theatrical release of Henzell's long-delayed follow-up, "No Place Like Home," which is also at BAM.)
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Beginner's luck -- or lack of same -- might almost be the movie's subject. Robbed upon arrival in Kingston, Ivan Martin (Cliff) founders at first in the urban maelstrom. Social conditions are manifest in documentary-type shots, filmed in 16 millimeter, of poverty and desperation. Ivan finds his footing only to mix it up with an assortment of predatory preachers, mercenary record producers, corrupt cops and miscellaneous hustlers. In the background, Toots & the Maytals, Desmond Dekker, Cliff and others sing a collective siren song of fame. Chased by the police, Ivan creates his own legend, leaving graffiti ("I am here -- I am everywhere") and imagining an audience for his last stand.
A movie of abrupt transitions, "The Harder They Come" appears to have been assembled piecemeal and shot off the cuff. Cliff, who wrote the title song, has described the film changing direction while in production. In an article published in The Caribbean Quarterly in 2015, the cinematographer Franklyn St. Juste said he never saw a script: "I really didn't know what was happening -- and what was going to happen from one scene to the next or from one setup to the next." But the spontaneity proved a recipe for what St. Juste termed "happy accidents."
The timing was also fortuitous. The film arrived on the international scene in the wake of "Shaft" (1971) and "Superfly" (1972), with a hero akin to the righteous outlaws in films like the Brazilian director Glauber Rocha's "Antonio das Mortes" (1969), Melvin Van Peebles's "Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song" (1971) and numerous Italian westerns. (It's hardly coincidental that Ivan goes to see "Django," Sergio Corbucci's 1966 evergreen.) For early audiences, Ivan's willingness to defy authority at the cost of his life evoked Bonnie and Clyde, the Black Panthers and Che Guevara.
After making a splash at the 1972 Venice Film Festival, "The Harder They Come" was picked up by Roger Corman's New World Pictures; it opened (with English subtitles, because of the particularly thick Jamaican patois) to some success at a Broadway theater in February 1973 and enjoyed a second run as an exploitation film. (I saw it that summer in Florida on a double bill with the Pam Grier prison movie "Black Mama, White Mama.") It would soon have a third life. In a 1974 piece titled "Films That Refuse to Fade Away," the New York Times critic Vincent Canby noted the movie's popularity as a midnight attraction.
As reported by Canby, "The Harder They Come" ran for 26 weeks at the Orson Welles Cinema in Cambridge, Mass., in 1973. A true cult film, it was brought back in 1974, where, as Jonathan Rosenbaum and I wrote in our book "Midnight Movies," it remained another seven years. In April 1976, The Times ran an article, noting that "The Harder They Come" had played 80 consecutive weekends at the Elgin Theater in Chelsea. (The run would continue there for months.)
In his enthusiasm, Canby called "The Harder They Come" "a more revolutionary black film than any number of American efforts, including 'Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song."' In any case, "The Harder They Come" provided a model for later movies, most notably the 1980 British film "Babylon," which belatedly opened in New York this spring and itself became a cult film. (It is on the Criterion Channel and can be streamed elsewhere.)
That film's director, Franco Rosso, named "The Harder They Come" as his inspiration. "Babylon" (1980) might be a sequel, focusing on West Indian life in London. An immersive, verité-style movie following a disaffected young singer of a homegrown reggae group, it uses a constant flow of music to animate the struggle for survival in a hostile white world. "The movie is more interested in what feels right than what seems right," the critic Wesley Morris wrote in his review for The Times.
See one and stream the other. Even more than the program I caught in Florida, they make a sensational double bill.

Texto completo: Rudy Giuliani revived an effort to convince the Ukrainian government to investigate a matter related to Joe Biden, the front-runner in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary.
Giuliani, who is President Trump's personal attorney, encouraged a top representative of the new Ukrainian President Volodymy Zelensky to look into whether there was any improper overlap between the former vice president's diplomatic overtures in Ukraine, and his son Hunter Biden's ties to an energy company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch, according to the New York Times.
He also asked Andriy Yermak, a close ally of Zelensky, to look into whether Ukrainian officials tried to undermine Trump's 2016 campaign.
Giuliani has called for Biden to be investigated for a trip he made in 2016 when he threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees if Ukraine did not dismiss Viktor Shokin, the country’s then-prosecutor general. Biden’s son, Hunter, stood to gain financially from having Shokin removed.
Giuliani said he "strongly urged" Yermak to “just investigate the darn things." These discussions included a recent in person meeting in Madrid.
In May, Giuliani was subject to intense criticism for a planned trip to Ukraine to meet with then-elect Zelensky to ask that Ukraine pursue these investigations. He called it off after facing pushback from the State Department and concerns about 2020 election meddling, complaining that he was the victim of a "setup."
This time around, Giuliani claims he was not acting on Trump's behalf, but rather as a private citizen, and arranged the correspondence with the help of the State Department. Yermak, whose government wants a Trump-Zelensky meeting, said it was unclear whether Giuliani was acting on his own.
During a visit to Washington last month, an aide to House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, a Democrat from Maryland, urged Yermak not to work with Giuliani.
Yermak said he did not interpret that conversation as a warning and told Giuliani and congressional staff that the Ukrainian government is committed to fair investigations into possible crimes once a new top prosecutor is confirmed by parliament.

Texto completo: "We're rebuild-ing the awesome might of the United States military. We make the best planes, we make the best missiles, we make the best ships, we make the best every-thing."
President Donald Trump
During his visit to Louisville
President Donald Trump signed a memo to automatically discharge federal student loan debt for permanently and totally disabled veterans during his visit to Louisville Wednesday, where he addressed more than 1,000 veterans.
"I have taken executive action to make sure our wounded warriors are not saddled with mountains of student debt," Trump told a crowd the Galt House, vowing to eliminate "every penny" of an average of $30,000 of student loan debt for about 25,000 disabled veterans.
Such veterans were already entitled to such debt forgiveness by law. But about half of the roughly 50,000 disabled veterans who are qualified to have their federal student loan debt forgiven have not received the benefit because of an application process that has proven burdensome, the administration said.
The memo directs the government to develop an "expedited" process, which the Department of Education said would mean loans are forgiven unless veterans opt out.
Trump's speech at the 75th national convention of AMVETS, a major U.S. veterans' organization, was part of a daylong visit to Louisville that also included a fundraiser for Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin's reelection bid.
Members of AMVETS, a congressionally chartered veterans service organization representing more than 250,000 veterans nationwide, cheered his speech.
Joe Chenelly, executive director of AMVETS, was glad the president, for the most part, stuck with key subjects that are priorities for veterans, including veterans' health services, employment, education and the disturbingly high rate of suicide among vets.
"Suicide prevention is certainly our biggest thing," Chenelly said.
Outside the downtown Galt House Hotel on the Ohio River, Trump's appearance drew vendors selling Trump 2020 flags and shirts. Protesters, including some veterans who opposed Trump's support of a ban on transgender service members, chanted and held signs blasting Trump for "destroying our democracy."
Inside, hundreds of veterans in garrison caps cheered Trump, who praised veterans and his efforts to build up the U.S. military, saying the U.S. had "pulverized" the Islamic State in Syria. He also touted the move to create a sixth branch of the Armed Forces, the "Space Force."
"We're rebuilding the awesome might of the United States military," he said. "We make the best planes, we make the best missiles, we make the best ships, we make the best everything."
Trump said he had worked to improve mental health services for veterans and reduce wait times and improve care at Veterans Affairs hospitals. He said the VA had fired 7,600 workers who weren't providing proper care to veterans.
He also said he'd worked to reduce veteran unemployment, which had reached "the lowest level ever recorded." In July 2019, the veteran unemployment rate was 3.4%, down from a high of 9.9% in 2011, according to the government.
"You are not forgotten," Trump said.
He announced he would "sign a memorandum directing the Department of Education to eliminate every penny of federal student loan debt owed by American veterans who are completely and permanently disabled."
"Incredible. Nobody can complain about that," he said, adding that federal taxes will not be applied to the forgiven debt.
In May, dozens of U.S. attorneys general, including Andy Beshear in Kentucky, urged the U.S. Department of Education to automatically forgive the student loans of veterans who became totally and permanently disabled in connection with their military service. Of more than 42,000 veterans eligible, fewer than 9,000 had applied, while many were defaulting on loans.
Trump, who spoke mostly from a teleprompter in a scripted speech, also gave a nod to Kentucky's political climate by shouting out Bevin and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, two of his closest allies in the Bluegrass State.
Trump said the event wasn't a campaign speech but still said he would "keep America great." Claiming his administration has solved problems of veterans' access to health care left by the previous administration, Trump said the "fake news" will probably try to undercut his claim.
"They'll find somebody who wasn't treated perfectly, and he'll be on the top of the news tonight," Trump said to laughter and applause from the crowd.
When introducing World War II veteran Woody Williams, who won the Medal of Honor, Trump — who received five deferments from the draft for military service during the Vietnam War — said of the medal: "I wanted one, but they told me I don't qualify," he said. "I said, 'Can I give it to myself anyway?' They said, 'I don't think that's a good idea.'"
Trump also mentioned a drug that could help reduce suicide, apparently referring to Spravato, an anti-depressant made by Johnson & Johnson, saying his administration was seeking to buy as much of it as possible. The VA in June approved the use of the costly drug despite reported concerns among some experts about its effectiveness, the New York Times has reported.
After the speech, Trump drove past protesters to the nearby Seelbach Hotel to meet with a group of supporters and headline the private fundraiser hosted by Bevin's campaign, where attendees could get a photo with Trump for $21,000. Bevin is being challenged by Democrat Beshear in what could be a close election.
To enter the Seelbach ballroom, attendees were required to hand over their phones, said C. Michael Davenport, a Frankfort real estate developer who attended the fundraiser. The president talked about the economy's strength, praised the governor and "revved up" the crowded ballroom, he said.
"The president did what the president does best: He talked about how great everything is," said Davenport, sporting a blue "Keep America Great" cap.
U.S. Rep. Andy Barr told the Courier Journal that Trump addressed the economy but did not talk taxes. On Tuesday, Trump had raised the possibility of another round of tax breaks, but quickly reversed that stance before boarding Air Force One to Louisville Wednesday morning.
Other Republicans spotted leaving the fundraiser at the Seelbach included U.S. Rep. Hal Rogers, State Auditor Mike Harmon, former Secretary of the Kentucky Cabinet for Economic Development Terry Gill, State Budget Director John Chilton and state attorney general candidate Daniel Cameron.
After Trump's speech Tuesday, Eric Scherer, an Army veteran from Sandusky, Ohio, said the debt forgiveness effort was important and approved of Trump's comments about building up the military. "New equipment for the military is long overdue," he said.
But not everyone came away enthused, including an older veteran who didn't give his name as he left. "I don't support him," he said of the president.
Trump, who arrived on Air Force One at 1:50 p.m., closing a major highway and other streets, departed around 5:30 p.m.

Texto completo: The White House on Wednesday sought to enlist the private sector in its effort to thwart the trafficking of fentanyl and other synthetic opioids, which have become the main drivers of fatal overdoses nationally and locally.
Last year in the 10-county southwestern Pennsylvania region, fentanyl was a factor in at least 72% of the roughly 862 drug deaths, versus 44% for heroin and 38 percent for cocaine. Most fatal overdoses involve a combination of drugs.
The Office of National Drug Control Policy is asking businesses to better protect their supply chains from the possibility that traffickers could sneak packages of deadly fentanyl into otherwise-legitimate shipping.
The office issued advisories on how companies can identify signs of the manufacturing and transportation of synthetic opioids, their marketing online and financial transactions related to their trade.
The office also identified two Chinese nationals and one organization there "as significant foreign narcotics traffickers pursuant to the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act," according to officials.
The Chinese entities have shipped hundreds of packages of opioids into the United States, selling online and using commercial mail carriers, according to the release. The White House said the Kingpin designations will "inhibit" traffickers.
The federal government is using banking data to track the flow of proceeds from illicit drug smuggling into and out of the country, according to the release. Financial institutions can help in this effort, according to officials.
Drug deaths in the region dropped last year from the record 1,427 in 2017, returning to 2015 levels.

Prominent U.S. Skating Coach Is Barred for Sexual Misconduct

Texto completo: Richard Callaghan, a prominent American figure skating coach who was suspended from the sport last year, was barred permanently on Wednesday, 20 years after he was first accused publicly of sexual misconduct involving a minor.
The decision to bar Mr. Callaghan for sexual misconduct was announced by the U.S. Center for SafeSport, a nonprofit organization created to investigate abuse of athletes. U.S. Figure Skating, the sport's national governing body, followed suit and also barred Mr. Callaghan, who is 73, from any skating-related activity in the United States. He has long denied any wrongdoing.
Mr. Callaghan is best known for coaching Tara Lipinski to an Olympic gold medal in 1998 and coaching Todd Eldredge to a world championship and six United States titles.
In 1999, Craig Maurizi, a prominent coach and former student of Mr. Callaghan's, told The New York Times that Mr. Callaghan had begun abusing him when he was 15 years old. Two other skaters also accused Mr. Callaghan of inappropriate behavior in the Times article.
Mr. Maurizi's accusations were dismissed at the time by U.S. Figure Skating because they had not been filed within 60 days of when the abuse was said to have occurred. But the case received renewed scrutiny when SafeSport was formed in 2017, and Mr. Callaghan was suspended from skating in March 2018.
"I feel finally vindicated," Mr. Maurizi said Wednesday. "This guy's a monster. This man has ruined the lives and careers of many people. I believe he should be punished to whatever extent is possible."
Wednesday's permanent ban came days after another former skater, Adam Schmidt, 34, filed a lawsuit against Mr. Callaghan, saying he had been abused by the coach starting at age 14. U.S. Figure Skating was also named as a defendant in the suit.
Mr. Schmidt said in a statement that the ban was a "major victory" for skaters who had been abused by Mr. Callaghan.
"Now he will be forever known as the predator who delivered medals to a corrupt organization who accepted them in exchange for the safety and protection of children," Mr. Schmidt added, referring to U.S. Figure Skating.
John Manly, Mr. Schmidt's lawyer, said in a statement that the ban was good news but "small comfort" to those hurt by Mr. Callaghan.
"It should have happened in the '90s," Mr. Manly said, adding that U.S. Figure Skating "has been infected by the cancer of child abuse. They need to cut this cancer out before it destroys this beautiful sport."
The ban against Mr. Callaghan followed recent public accusations of sexual assault made by two female skaters against John Coughlin, a two-time national pairs champion, who died by suicide in January after being suspended from the sport.

Fact-Checking Trump's Claim That He Didn't Start Family Separations at Border

Texto completo: What President Trump Said
"President Obama had separation. I'm the one that brought them together."
-- in remarks to reporters on Wednesday
False.
Mr. Trump's immigration policies were in the news again on Wednesday with the administration's release of a regulation that would allow it to detain indefinitely migrant families who cross the border illegally.
Questioned about the new policy, which is sure to be challenged in court, Mr. Trump continued his pattern of blaming "loopholes," nonexistent laws and former presidents for his own administration's practice of separating migrant families who cross illegally. President Barack Obama, in particular, has been wrongly cast as the instigator of the practice by Mr. Trump at least two dozen other times.
Under Mr. Trump, the Justice Department announced its "zero-tolerance policy" for illegally entering the United States in April 2018, describing it as "new" and in response to an increase in unauthorized border crossings that spring.
The policy called for the criminal prosecution of everyone who enters the country illegally. As a result, nearly 3,000 children were forcibly separated from adult family members who were detained under the new policy, which multiple top Trump officials have characterized as a deterrent.
Mr. Trump signed an executive order in June 2018 that was meant to end the practice of family separation.
While previous administrations did break up families, it was rare -- for example, in cases in which there was doubt about the familial relationship between a child and an accompanying adult, according to former officials and immigration experts.
"Nothing like what the Trump administration is doing has occurred before," Sarah Pierce of the Migration Policy Institute told The New York Times last year.
Mr. Trump's aides and political allies have misleadingly claimed a 1997 consent decree known as the Flores settlement necessitated family separation. That court agreement limited how long the government could hold migrant children and set standards for their care.
After a surge of families from Central America began arriving at the United States' southwestern border in 2014, the Obama administration opened family detention centers. That prompted criticism and more lawsuits, which argued that the move had breached the Flores settlement by not releasing children swiftly.
In 2016, the Ninth Circuit of Appeals ruled that the Flores settlement "unambiguously applies both to minors who are accompanied and unaccompanied by their parents." It also overturned a Federal District Court's decision that the government must also release the parents.
The new rule unveiled by the Trump administration on Wednesday, if carried out, would replace the standards set by Flores and allow for the indefinite detention of families.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Months after backing out of a trip to Ukraine amid criticism that he was mixing partisan politics with foreign policy, Rudolph W. Giuliani, President Trump's personal lawyer, has renewed his push for the Ukrainian government to pursue investigations into political opponents of Mr. Trump.
Over the last few weeks, Mr. Giuliani has spoken on the phone and held an in-person meeting, in Madrid, with a top representative of the new Ukrainian president, encouraging his government to ramp up investigations into two matters of intense interest to Mr. Trump.
One is whether Ukrainian officials took steps during the 2016 election to damage Mr. Trump's campaign. The other is whether there was anything improper about the overlap between former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s diplomatic efforts in Ukraine and his son's role with a gas company there.
Mr. Giuliani said he was acting on his own as a private citizen, with the knowledge and assistance of the State Department. He would not say whether Mr. Trump approved -- or is aware of -- the effort.
But his outreach is the latest chapter in a remarkable effort by Mr. Giuliani, who conducts private business around the world, to use his status as Mr. Trump's lawyer to try to influence another country's affairs to help his client politically.
His previous efforts to pressure the Ukrainians had drawn condemnation from Democrats. And during a trip to Washington last month, Mr. Giuliani's Ukrainian contact was urged by an aide to Representative Steny H. Hoyer, the Democratic majority leader, not to work with Mr. Giuliani on the issues, according to people familiar with the meeting.
The conflicting directives from the two parties in the United States highlight the tricky calculus facing Volodymyr Zelensky, a comedian who was elected president of Ukraine in April by a wide margin after campaigning on promises to root out corruption and to seek a settlement to the war with Russian-backed separatists that has killed 13,000 Ukrainians.
The situation in Washington poses an early -- and potentially significant -- test for Mr. Zelensky and his fledgling government. Relations with the United States are pivotal for Ukraine. Its army has been fortified by American military aid, including soldiers deployed as trainers, and Ukrainian officials want that to continue. Mr. Zelensky is also appealing for greater American diplomatic backing in peace talks.
Mr. Zelensky's handling of the requests to investigate the two politically charged matters is likely to upset either Mr. Trump and his Republican supporters, or top Democrats, including allies of Mr. Biden, a leading candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination.
A Ukrainian news site asserted that "if Ukraine supports the current president and sells out Biden, it would become a cause of deep and irreversible processes which later will circle back on Ukraine in a very unpleasant manner."
Mr. Giuliani's efforts have inflamed the situation, said several government officials who handle foreign policy in the United States and Ukraine. Speaking anonymously to avoid running afoul of Mr. Trump or his allies, they blamed Mr. Giuliani for complicating efforts to arrange a visit by Mr. Zelensky to the White House, and for creating a perception that such a meeting would be contingent upon the new Ukrainian government demonstrating support for the investigations.
While Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky have spoken on the phone, they have yet to meet in person. Meetings are possible next month, either on the sidelines of the United Nations meeting in New York or when Mr. Trump attends a World War II commemoration in Poland.
But the Ukrainians covet a White House meeting as a symbolic show of support from a president who has often passed up opportunities to aggressively condemn Russia for its aggression.
In an interview on Tuesday, Mr. Giuliani cast his efforts as intended to help Ukraine advance its long fight to root out corruption across its government, including among prosecutors. But he did not totally reject the suggestion that he was complicating relations between the two governments.
"I can't really evaluate that -- whether my involvement in it makes it worse or better," he said. "I can't see how advocating for an investigation of two alleged crimes puts too much pressure on them, other than to do the right thing."
He acknowledged that he had "strongly urged" the Ukrainian official, Andriy Yermak, a close ally of Mr. Zelensky, to "just investigate the darn things."
A former mayor of New York and federal prosecutor, Mr. Giuliani conceded that Mr. Zelensky is in a difficult position, but, he said, "When you have a decision like that, you're going to piss off somebody, so you might as well make the right decision, right?"
He said he came away from his interactions with Mr. Yermak "pretty confident they're going to investigate it."
In interviews this month, Mr. Yermak, a lawyer and former television producer who has known Mr. Zelensky for years, said he discussed with Mr. Giuliani both the possible heads of state meeting and the investigations. But he said they did not discuss a link between the two.
"He said he's very interested in seeing the new Ukrainian government being open and openly investigating all these cases," said Mr. Yermak.
He said he told Mr. Giuliani and, separately, congressional staff with whom he met last month in Washington that the new government was committed to fairly investigating possible crimes, but all decisions would have to wait until the Ukrainian parliament confirmed a new top prosecutor, no earlier than next month. Mr. Yermak said he did not interpret his conversation with Mr. Hoyer's staff as a warning to avoid investigating the Biden matter.
Mr. Yermak was dispatched to Washington by Mr. Zelensky last month to build relationships with American officials, discuss possible American sanctions on a Russian oil pipeline and set the stage for a Trump-Zelensky meeting, for which Mr. Yermak said "we are waiting impatiently."
Mr. Yermak said it was not clear to him whether Mr. Giuliani was representing Mr. Trump in their talks.
Mr. Giuliani said he explicitly stated that he was not.
The White House referred questions about Mr. Giuliani's role to the State Department, which did not respond to a request for comment.
Mr. Giuliani said he briefed State Department officials on the back-channel communications. They were arranged with assistance from the State Department, including Kurt D. Volker, the United States envoy to settlement talks in Ukraine's war with Russia, who met at the White House last month with Mr. Yermak, another Ukrainian official and top Trump administration officials.
Mr. Volker declined to comment on the Giuliani-Yermak talks.
Mr. Yermak said he asked Mr. Volker to arrange the talks, and people familiar with the effort said it was intended at least partly to turn down the temperature around the issue.
Mr. Giuliani was widely criticized after it was reported that he and his associates had been working to advance the investigations with Ukrainian prosecutors who had been appointed under Mr. Zelensky's predecessors and who had been accused of corruption.
The prosecutors had been pushing investigations into the gas company for which Mr. Biden's son Hunter worked and the oligarch who owned it. The prosecutors had also been pushing investigations into Ukrainian officials accused of improperly trying to damage Mr. Trump's 2016 campaign.
The criticism of Mr. Giuliani escalated after The New York Times revealed that he planned to travel to Kiev in May to encourage Mr. Zelensky, who had yet to take office at that point, to press ahead with the investigations.
Amid the uproar, Mr. Giuliani, who has done business in Ukraine, canceled the trip, accusing Democrats of misrepresenting his efforts and suggesting that some members of Mr. Zelensky's team never intended to give him a fair hearing and were in fact trying to lure him into a "set up."

Pakistan's Prime Minister Says He's Done Trying to Talk to India

Texto completo: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan -- Prime Minister Imran Khan of Pakistan intensified his criticism of India on Wednesday over its Kashmir crackdown, saying he would no longer seek dialogue with Indian officials and raising the threat of a military escalation between the nuclear-armed neighbors.
In an interview with The New York Times, Mr. Khan complained bitterly about what he described as repeated rebuffs from Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India at his entreaties for communication, both before and after the Aug. 5 crackdown on the disputed territory of Kashmir.
"There is no point in talking to them. I mean, I have done all the talking. Unfortunately, now when I look back, all the overtures that I was making for peace and dialogue, I think they took it for appeasement," Mr. Khan said during the interview, at the prime minister's office in Islamabad. "There is nothing more that we can do."
Mr. Khan has repeatedly denounced India's Hindu nationalist government for terminating the autonomy of the India-controlled part of Kashmir in an abrupt move more than two weeks ago. India deployed thousands of troops to quell any possible unrest and severed nearly all communications in the poor Himalayan region, the flash point for two wars between India and Pakistan.
Indian soldiers and police officers have been accused of using excessive force on Kashmiri civilians, and have detained the territory's political leadership, drawing strong criticism from rights groups and the United Nations.
It has been difficult to ascertain the full extent of the crackdown because of the Indian measures, which officials say they are slowly lifting. Thousands of Kashmiris, however, have been unable to attend funerals, births or call and check in on their loved ones because of the curfews, myriad checkpoints and a communications blockade on the region.
There was no immediate comment from the Indian government in New Delhi on Mr. Khan's remarks. But India's ambassador to the United States, Harsh Vardhan Shringla, who was visiting The New York Times editorial board, rejected the criticism.
"Our experience has been that every time we have taken an initiative toward peace, it has turned out badly for us," the ambassador said. "We expect Pakistan to take credible, irreversible and verifiable action against terrorism."
He also disputed the severity of India's actions in Kashmir. "We are looking at things going back to normal," he said. "Restrictions are being eased based on the ground situation."
"Public utility services, banks and hospitals are functioning normally," the Indian ambassador added. "There are adequate food stocks. Some restrictions on communication are in the interests of safety and security of the citizenry."
International rights groups and Kashmiris say ordinary citizens are unable to reach hospitals because of Indian security checkpoints, and medical and food stocks ran low shortly after India stripped the region of its autonomy this month.
Most of Kashmir's political leadership has been detained by Indian forces, many of them locked up in a hotel for the past few weeks, unable to communicate with their constituents or the outside world. Indian officials have said these politicians were detained over concerns they were inciting violence, although there is little evidence of that.
In their litany of accusations, Mr. Khan and his cabinet ministers have likened the New Delhi government to Nazi Germany and claimed that a genocide is unfolding in the territory.
Although Mr. Khan's assertions have been criticized for their hyperbole, many Indian Muslims do feel discriminated against by the central government, which has often watched on as Hindu citizens have violently targeted them.
Mr. Khan's interview with The Times was his first with an international news organization aimed at publicizing his anger over what is happening in Kashmir -- and it appeared to reflect his frustration at what he views as India's intransigence.
Indian officials have described their new policy on Kashmir as a legal and internal matter that was part of an effort to improve the region's economic prospects. They have said the deployment of armed forces was precautionary, preventive and temporary.
Echoing what he and his subordinates have said on social media and in Pakistani news outlets, Mr. Khan described Mr. Modi as a fascist and Hindu supremacist who intends to eradicate Kashmir's mostly Muslim population and populate the region with Hindus.
"The most important thing is that eight million people's lives are at risk. We are all worried that there is ethnic cleansing and genocide about to happen," Mr. Khan said.
Such accusations have been dismissed as absurd by Mr. Modi's government.
Mr. Khan spoke to The Times a day after he said he had spoken by phone with President Trump and told him of a "potentially very explosive situation" between his country and India.
Last month, Mr. Khan visited Washington and met with Mr. Trump, who said he would be willing to mediate the conflict. His offer was welcomed by Mr. Khan but has not been accepted by India.
Mr. Trump reiterated his offer on Tuesday, telling NBC News: "I'll do the best I can to mediate or do something."
Mr. Khan expressed concern that India might undertake a deceptive "false-flag operation" in Kashmir to try to justify military action against Pakistan. And Pakistan, he said, would be forced to respond.
"And then you are looking at two nuclear-armed countries eyeball to eyeball, and anything can happen," he said.
"My worry is that this can escalate and for two nuclear-armed countries, it should be alarming for the world what we are facing now."
Mr. Khan's warnings of a wider nuclear conflagration reprised comments from Islamabad shortly after Indian warplanes infiltrated Pakistani airspace in March. Indian government officials have dismissed such warnings, claiming that Pakistan is using the threat of nuclear war to push the international community to mediate and force India into talks.
India's nuclear weapons policy is known as "no first use," meaning the country will not initiate the use of its arsenal in any conflict.
But last Friday, India's defense minister, Rajnath Singh, seemed to loosen the cautious restraint that has made up the country's nuclear weapons policy for decades, saying on Twitter that future use of its arsenal "depends on the circumstances."
Shortly after taking office last summer, Mr. Khan reached out to India in an attempt to revive talks between the countries on a wide range of issues, including Kashmir. But Indian officials rejected Mr. Khan's efforts with a longstanding response that they will negotiate only after Pakistan cuts ties to militant groups. Pakistan denies it has links to such groups.
With Pakistani-Indian relations in crisis, it is difficult to see how, in the foreseeable future, the countries can resume the on-again, off-again talks that have punctuated their relationship since they were partitioned in 1947.
The relationship hit a low point this year, when a Kashmiri militant crammed his car full of explosives and detonated it as he charged into an Indian paramilitary convey, killing dozens. It was the worst attack in the region in 30 years. In response, the Indian Air Force breached Pakistani airspace to launch a strike on what it said was a militant training camp operating openly on its neighbor's soil.
Mr. Khan demanded that United Nations peacekeepers and observers be allowed in Indian-controlled Kashmir, and he repeatedly insisted that Mr. Modi intended to carry out a genocide of Kashmiri Muslims.

NYT reporter Maggie Haberman: Trump's Greenland fit may be a distraction

Texto completo: Canceling a trip to Denmark may be a distraction tactic, according to the New York Times' Maggie Haberman.
On the morning after Trump abruptly announced he was postponing a meeting with Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen in two weeks because of her refusal to entertain his interest in buying Greenland, the White House correspondent told CNN she does not know Trump's true motive. But she offered a few ideas, including that the president simply did not want to make the trip.
"The president was already getting disinterested in this trip before the Wall Street Journal broke that story about him having conversations about purchasing Greenland. He has been talking about the idea of seeing if they could acquire Greenland for many, many, many months. This was not something that came up recently," she said.
She said Trump's staff "mocking him" for the idea of purchasing Greenland "sets the tone."
Haberman also said the timing of canceling the visit, which was set for early September, is suggestive.
"There’s also been a change of leadership in Denmark since this trip was initially discussed. But look, regardless of why it is he doesn’t want to do it, the way that he did this is hugely disrespectful to a NATO ally. This is not how you handle diplomatic relations," she said. "You don’t do it by tweet after there have been weeks and weeks of preparations. You don’t do it necessarily the same day that you have suggested Russia should be admitted into the G-7. And I don't think that's unrelated."

Trump renewed his call for Russia to be readmitted into the Group of Seven on Tuesday, saying it would be an "appropriate" move. Russia was kicked out in 2014 after it annexed Crimea.
Haberman said she thinks Trump might even be distracting from multiple issues, sticking to a 2016 campaign strategy by "throwing out so many pieces of chum that he's hoping nothing in particular sticks."
Haberman said Trump's tweets about American Jews who favor Democrats being disloyal was another diversion.
"He could be distracting from any number of things," she said, adding that it may also just be an "easy way out" from a trip he did not want to do.

'In a word, gross': Modern DNA tests reveal doctors used their own sperm in artificial insemination procedures

Texto completo: A number of doctors and fertility specialists have reportedly used their own sperm to impregnate women undergoing artificial insemination in past decades.
A New York Times investigation found that multiple children have been born whose DNA doesn’t match that of an anonymous or selected donor, but rather that of the doctor who helped their parents perform the procedure.
Eve Wiley was 16 when her mother, Margo Williams, told her that she had been conceived through artificial insemination because her father was infertile. Years later, Wiley, who is now 32, took a consumer DNA test and found her biological father was actually Dr. Kim McMorries, the man whom Williams had asked to help find a donor.
McMorries reportedly told Williams that the sperm came from a sperm bank in California.
“You build your whole life on your genetic identity, and that’s the foundation,” Wiley said. “But when those bottom bricks have been removed or altered, it can be devastating.”
In another case, Dr. Donald Cline used his own sperm to artificially inseminate at least three dozen women throughout the 1970s and 1980s, prosecutors allege. Cline pleaded guilty to two felony obstruction of justice charges and surrendered his medical license.
In Canada, 80-year-old Dr. Norman Barwin’s fertility specialist license was revoked in June by the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario after he allegedly impregnated at least 11 women using his own sperm. A number of other donor children also claim that Barwin used the wrong sperm, though not his, to conceive them.
“[Barwin’s] actions will continue to have repercussions for his patients and their families in perpetuity,” said Carolyn Silver, a lawyer with the college.
Law professor Dr. Jody Madeira is following instances of the practice in the U.S. and overseas. She said she has tracked more than 20 cases in a dozen different states, as well as England, Germany, the Netherlands, and South Africa.
In the Netherlands, the Dutch Donor Child Foundation said that one fertility specialist, Dr. Jan Karbaat, fathered at least 56 children. Karbaat closed his clinic in 2009 and died at the age of 89 in 2017.
Dov Fox, a bioethicist at the University of San Diego, explained that in the past, those who were attempting to get pregnant would likely not have expected their doctors to end up being the father of their children.
“In a word, gross,” Fox said of the multiple cases. “In a couple more: shocking, shameful. The number of doctors sounds less like a few bad apples and more like a generalized practice of deception, largely hidden until recently by a mix of low-tech and high stigma.”
Indiana and California have passed laws that criminalize using wrong sperm, with Texas going a step further and defining it as a form of sexual assault. Those found guilty under Texas law, which passed unanimously, must register as sex offenders.

Texto completo: The president of the United States pouting over his imaginary plan to buy Greenland — something that will never, ever happen, as Denmark's prime minister just made clear — is getting far more attention than how his policies are helping to melt the Danish territory’s ice at a worst-case-scenario rate scientists didn’t think would happen until 2070.
Donald Trump giving a thumbs-up as if congratulating a baby orphaned during the mass shooting in El Paso, Texas, stirred some condemnation. But Trump spending the weeks after the slaughter enacting anti-immigration policies that could have been lifted directly from the murderer’s manifesto has barely yielded the wearied shrug many Americans have mastered since 2015.
Trump is also preparing to contest a possible loss in 2020 by resuscitating his aging voter fraud lies that even his own “Election Integrity” commission debunked as Republicans, led by “Moscow” Mitch McConnell, keep blocking any legislation that might prevent the sort of Russian interference in our elections that FBI Director Christopher Wray says is “absolutely” happening.
All of this nonsense just keeps flowing through our brains as it’s sucked into our collective memory wormhole. Why?
If only we could ignore the optics
Blame “the optics. ”
Pundits have been worried about “the optics” of politics since the 1970s, when The Wall Street Journal warned President Jimmy Carter that “optics will not cure inflation. ” More recently, NBC News’ Chuck Todd declared Robert Mueller’s testimony on Capitol Hill a “disaster” because of the “optics. ”
Pretty much the only person rushing to Todd’s defense was Frank Luntz — the Republican “wordsmith” who helped popularize the term “illegal immigrant” to help kill immigration reform during George W. Bush’s presidency. Luntz tweeted that because so few Americans had read the Mueller report, “optics matter more than substance in deciding public opinion. ”
Forget that Mueller demolished Trump’s key claims that the report exonerated him of collusion and obstruction — the report didn’t even consider collusion and laid out multiple possible obstruction crimes. But the former special counsel didn’t sound as livid as Sean Hannity. So, disaster.
Ignore the optics and you’ll see that since Mueller’s testimony, three dozen House Democrats, including the assistant speaker of the House, have joined the 90 House Democrats and independent Justin Amash who already supported opening an impeachment inquiry.
You also have to look beyond the optics of Trump’s 12,000 false and misleading claims and more than 2,300 conflicts of interest to see a man who spends most of his presidency watching cable and the rest golfing and promoting his businesses at a cost of at least $105 million, or more than 262 times his presidential salary.
Melting into a pond of self-tanner
In optics world, amnesia must be feigned when Trump reads comforting words off a teleprompter that he’ll certainly contradict as soon as he finds the guy who carries his Twitter phone. We have to pretend there is some possibility he might pursue some gun safety legislation, though we’ve already been through the exact charade where he pretends to stand up to the National Rifle Association and then melts into a pond of self-tanner.
While Trump opposes universal background checks for guns, a position shared by barely double digits of the American public, many in the news media are following the lead of the questioners at all four of the Democratic debates — fixating on whether the opposition party is going "too far left," a practically verbatim echo of Republican talking points.
Meanwhile, stories about Trump trying to cut 500,000 kids off school lunches flare and disappear faster than a Trump retweet of a conspiracy theorist of exactly the sort the FBI recently warned about.
Then faint concerns about the “optics” of the president of the United States encouraging a domestic terror threat quickly fade away, even though ABC News found “at least 36 criminal cases where Trump was invoked in direct connection with violent acts, threats of violence or allegations of assault. ” That’s 36 more than Barack Obama and George W. Bush combined.
Trump 'rivals' are always fake threats
Trump may understand the media's dependence on optics better than any person alive. "Before taking office, Mr. Trump told top aides to think of each presidential day as an episode in a television show in which he vanquishes rivals,” The New York Times reported.
His “rivals” may include the “invaders” the El Paso killer ranted about, or the former employees he hired and now insists were never employable in the first place, or even Fox News, if his poll numbers are bad enough, or all of them. But they are never climate change, or whatever is causing life expectancy in America to decline, or the country that attacked our elections once and plans to do it again.
To be fair, the news media lack a basic literacy to cover the Trump presidency because there was never supposed to be a president this good at manipulating them.
Trump’s constant betrayals of decency and American values should be the only way to look at this deplorable presidency. But could you imagine the optics of that?

Texto completo: The rankings and lists that Greenville has made by this time are part of the tagline for describing what it has become — and there are so many now that things have begun to get more specific.
In the case of the New York Times, the focus is the Village of West Greenville.
In a feature today, the NYT establishes that Greenville is already a "buzzy destination for the culinary and creative arts after years of economic growth and urban revitalization.
But it highlights The Village, once its own population center to support the production of textiles, followed by a decline as the plants closed, then brought back to life more than a decade ago by artists, who saw opportunity outside of downtown Greenville.
"In recent years, the enclave known as "The Village" of West Greenville has been transformed into an artistic and entrepreneurial district with an eclectic mix of small businesses," the feature reads.
Five aspects are highlighted: The Greenville Center for the Creative Arts, which was created in 2015 through the renovation of a former cotton factory.
It's a hub for The Village that features in-house artists and a gallery for talent ranging from local to international.
Art school is offered, and the center is a focal point of the village's "First Friday" open-house monthly event.
The Anchorage restaurant, which chef Greg McPhee opened in 2017 in a former mill infirmary.
Last year, the restaurant, visually stunning with a fully encompassing mural, was a semifinalist for best new restaurant in the prestigious James Beard awards.
The Village Grind coffee shop. Like the cultural center, it was opened in 2015.
The cafe uses locally sourced coffee beans from Methodical and Due South Coffee, along with pastries and other cafe items prepared by neighborhood bakers.
The Flatiron Building on a Pendleton Street corner, one of the more-noticeable buildings in The Village for its triangular shape.
The NYT highlights the paintings of Joseph Bradley as the "most well-known outside of Greenville."
Indigo Flow & Art, a hybrid yoga studio and art gallery on Pendleton Street run by a mother-daughter duo — Katie (yoga instructor) and Julie (artist) Hughes.
The two allocate 10% of profits to an outreach program for local at-risk youth.

Texto completo: A Canadian newspaper that ran a cartoon seen as anti-Semitic has apologized following backlash from the local Jewish community.
The Edmonton Journal cartoon by Malcolm Mayes was about a data breach that exposed personal information belonging to millions of Capital One customers featuring a "data hacker" sitting with a laptop inside a wallet. The hacker had a black beard and a large nose reminiscent of anti-Semitic caricatures of Jews.
"We are disgusted with Mr. Mayes's cartoon, with your tacit approval of it in your willingness to publish it, or, alternatively, we are astonished by your willful blindness if you did not see the harm that this cartoon would cause," Jewish Federation of Edmonton President Steven Shafir wrote to the paper's editorial staff, according to the Canadian Jewish News.
According to Honest Reporting Canada, a pro-Israel advocacy group, "Mayes has a history of anti-Israel caricatures," including one in which hands labeled Israel and Hamas are illustrated as pushing Palestinians into a meat grinder.
The Journal apologized, saying in a statement on its website that it has "been pointed out that the image of the person bears resemblance to anti-Semitic tropes prevalent in some anti-Jewish propaganda. This resemblance was entirely unintentional, but given that association, the Edmonton Journal apologizes for the publication of the cartoon. We are re-examining the procedures we have in place to vet editorial content to avoid future such occurrences."
Earlier this year, The New York Times apologized for running what it called an "anti-Semitic political cartoon."

End Russia's Pariah Status by Readmitting It to Group of 7, Trump Says

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- President Trump said on Tuesday that Russia should be readmitted to the Group of 7 industrialized nations, a call for ending Moscow's pariah status on the world stage that is likely to earn a cool reception when the group's annual summit opens this weekend.
Speaking a few days before his planned departure for the summit, in Biarritz, France, Mr. Trump said that Moscow's exclusion since 2014 from the group of leading economic powers should be reversed and, ignoring Russia's aggression in Ukraine, contended that the true reason for it was President Barack Obama's wounded pride.
"I think it's much more appropriate to have Russia in," Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office before a meeting with President Klaus Iohannis of Romania. "I could certainly see it being the G8 again."
One reason, Mr. Trump said, was "because a lot of the things we talk about have to do with Russia."
Russia was disinvited from gatherings of the former Group of 8 after the country's annexation of Crimea, which in a joint statement the remaining group members called a violation of international law that could have "grave implications for the legal order that protects the unity and sovereignty of all states."
Mr. Trump, who made similar comments before last year's Group of 7 meeting in Canada, did not attach any conditions to his proposal, which could signal that the international community has moved on from Russia's aggression toward Ukraine. It was the latest of several suggestions by Mr. Trump -- whose 2016 campaign's contacts with Kremlin-affiliated Russians were the subject of a long federal investigation, and who has personally courted the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin -- that Russia has been unfairly treated by the United States and its allies.
That was in contrast to the view of France's president, Emmanuel Macron, who a day earlier told a visiting Mr. Putin that Russia could rejoin the elite gathering if it helped end the continuing conflict in Ukraine. Moscow has supported a bloody rebellion by pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine that the United Nations estimates has claimed more than 13,000 lives since it began five years ago.
In a news conference with Mr. Putin, Mr. Macron called resolving the international "dispute" over Russia's policy toward Ukraine "the key" to Russian readmission into a reconstituted Group of 8.
Steven Pifer, a former United States ambassador to Ukraine, said he could envision a Russian return to the annual meetings, which aim for consensus action on issues like trade, terrorism, energy and the environment. But that should happen only if Russia earns its readmission by helping bring peace to Ukraine, he said.
"On one level, I agree with President Trump that it would be nice to get to a new U.S.-Russia relationship," said Mr. Pifer, now a William Perry fellow at Stanford University. "But he never seems to suggest that Russia has to make some changes to its policies to get to that point."
Mr. Pifer allowed that demanding the return of Crimea to Ukraine seemed much less realistic than an end to the conflict in eastern Ukraine. "It's hard to see how Ukraine gets the leverage to get Crimea back," he said.
In his remarks on Tuesday, Mr. Trump made no reference to Russia's annexation of the strategically valuable Crimean Peninsula, which began with a military intervention after Ukraine's 2014 revolution ousted a pro-Russia leader and was consummated in a referendum widely condemned as illegitimate.
Instead, Mr. Trump, who has shown little concern about the fate of Crimea and has even suggested that it may rightfully belong to Russia, implied that Moscow's real offense had been to embarrass his predecessor, Mr. Obama, who had unsuccessfully warned Russia against seizing the region.
"I guess President Obama, because Putin outsmarted him, President Obama thought it wasn't a good thing to have Russia in," Mr. Trump said. "So he wanted Russia out."
"Well, that's not the way it really should work," he added.
The president addressed the issue on Tuesday in response to a question from a reporter, who noted that the United States will host next year's Group of 7 summit. Mr. Trump hinted that he would not press the issue himself, however.
"If somebody would make that motion," the president said, "I would certainly be disposed to think about it very favorably."
Those remarks echoed Mr. Trump's words from June of last year when, before departing for the Group of 7 summit in Canada, he declared that "Russia should be in this meeting."
"Whether you like it or not -- and it may not be politically correct -- but we have a world to run," he added.
But that scenario appears highly unlikely for now. No other Group of 7 leaders echoed Mr. Trump's call last year. Nor does Russia seem to be clamoring for readmission.
Appearing Monday with Mr. Macron, Mr. Putin did not reject the idea but asked: "How can I come back into an organization that doesn't exist? It is called the G7 today."
Responding to a New York Times article that he is likely to tap his deputy secretary of state, John Sullivan, as his next ambassador to Moscow, Mr. Trump said that Mr. Sullivan was "very respected" and "could very well" be his nominee.

Trump says Jewish people who vote for Democrats show 'great disloyalty' or 'lack of knowledge'

Texto completo: President Trump on Tuesday said that Jewish people who vote for Democrats are showing "either a total lack of knowledge or great disloyalty," prompting an outcry from critics who said the president's remarks were promoting anti-Semitic stereotypes.
Trump made the comment in an exchange with reporters in the Oval Office ahead of a meeting with Romanian President Klaus Iohannis.
Trump began by lashing out at Democratic Representative Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, questioning the sincerity of her tears at a news conference where she talked about her decision not to travel to Israel to see her elderly grandmother, who lives in the occupied West Bank.
"Yesterday, I noticed for the first time, Tlaib with the tears," Trump said. "All of the sudden, she starts with tears, tears. . . . I don't buy it for a second, because I've seen her in a very vicious mood at campaign rallies, my campaign rallies, before she was a congresswoman."
He then went on to attack Democrats more generally over the views of Tlaib and Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota. Both women have long been critics of Israel and its treatment of Palestinians. They support the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, a global protest of Israel known as BDS.
"Where has the Democratic Party gone?" Trump asked. "Where have they gone, where they're defending these two people over the state of Israel? And I think any Jewish people that vote for a Democrat, I think it shows either a total lack of knowledge or great disloyalty."
Critics on both sides of the aisle immediately pointed out that Trump's use of the word "disloyalty" had echoes of anti-Semitic tropes accusing Jews of dual allegiance.
Omar responded to the president's remark with a two-word tweet. "Oh my," she said, followed by a facepalm emoji.
Some on Tuesday also noted that the overwhelming majority of American Jews have long voted Democratic. In 2016, for instance, 71 percent of Jewish voters voted for the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, while 23 percent voted for Trump, according to exit polls.

Pompeo, GOP heavyweights meet amid Senate rumors
Secretary of State Michael Pompeo attended a private briefing over lunch on Tuesday with Republican stalwarts including Arthur Laffer, Steve Forbes, and billionaires John and Margo Catsimatidis, amid rising speculation that the top US diplomat may run for the Senate next year.
The attendees at the lunch hosted by the Committee to Unleash Prosperity were confirmed by two people familiar with the event. The luncheon, though not the names of the guests, was also on Pompeo's public schedule for his trip to New York, where he arrived Monday evening.
The move comes amid rising speculation that Pompeo, a former House member from Kansas, may step down from President Trump's administration to run for a Senate seat opening up following the retirement next year of Pat Roberts. Bloomberg reported this month that Republican political donors have been told to hold off contributing to that race in expectation that Pompeo will run.
Pompeo, one of Trump's most trusted Cabinet members, has given mixed signals about his political future.
The Committee to Unleash Prosperity was founded by Laffer, Forbes, and Stephen Moore, who withdrew from consideration for a spot on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors earlier this year following criticism from Republican lawmakers.

Billboard in Baltimore calls Jared Kushner a 'rich pest'
A billboard in Baltimore, supported by the group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, draws a comparison between the president's son-in-law and a rat, playing off President Trump's recent comments in which he called the Maryland city a "rat and rodent infested mess."
The billboard went up Monday near City Hall, the city's central police district office, and other municipal buildings.
It shows a cartoon of Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who is an owner of rodent-infested apartment buildings in the Baltimore area.
On the billboard, Kushner is called a "rich pest" as he sits on a pile of money on the billboard; across from him is a cartoon rat holding a piece of cheese. The billboard calls it "poor guy just trying to survive."
In late July, Trump sent tweets disparaging Baltimore, calling it a "disgusting" place "no human" would want to live.
Kushner owns more than a dozen apartment buildings that were cited for more than 200 code violations in 2017. The problems included reports of maggots, mold, and mice invasions. One private investigator who looked into Kushner's properties called the managers "slumlords."

Ryan moving to Maryland, not selling Wisconsin home
Former House speaker Paul Ryan is moving his family from his hometown of Janesville, Wis., to a house in a Washington, D.C., suburb less than a year after he retired from Congress saying he wanted to spend more time with his children.
Ryan spokesman Kevin Seifert said Tuesday that Ryan and his family will be "temporarily" renting a house in Maryland and splitting their time between there and their longtime home in Janesville. He is not selling the Janesville house, where he lived throughout his 20 years in Congress.
The move will put Ryan and his family closer to the sisters of Ryan's wife, Janna Ryan, who live in the area.
Since leaving Congress at the end of 2018, Ryan started the nonprofit American Idea Foundation. That will still be based in Janesville.

Castro qualifies for the next Democratic debate
Julián Castro, the former housing secretary, on Tuesday became the 10th Democratic presidential candidate to qualify for the next round of debates, after a new national poll showed him earning 2 percent support.
The poll, conducted for CNN by SSRS, a research firm, was the fourth qualifying poll to show Castro having cleared that hurdle. He had already met the other qualifying standard set by the Democratic National Committee by receiving donations from more than 130,000 people.
Castro joins former vice president Joe Biden; Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey; Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind.; Senator Kamala Harris of California; Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; former representative Beto O'Rourke of Texas; Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont; Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts; and entrepreneur Andrew Yang.
All of the candidates who qualify for the debate stage in September will also make the cut for the following round of debates, in October.

Texto completo: A Russian-born British citizen claims in a lawsuit that FBI informant Stefan Halper “embroiled an innocent woman” — her — “in a conspiracy to undo the 2016 presidential election and topple the president of the United States of America.”
Halper, 75, a Cambridge professor and an FBI informant against Trump’s campaign, demanded the claims in the U.S. District Court of Eastern Virginia filed in May by Svetlana Lokhova in a complaint that labels him a “spy” and “rat f---er” be dismissed and his accuser be sanctioned by the judge.

The Great Falls, Virginia, resident worked as an FBI informant in 2016 and had discussions with at least three Trump campaign members: foreign policy aides George Papadopoulos and Carter Page and Trump campaign co-chairman Sam Clovis. The New York Times reported in April that the Justice Department inspector general was looking into his actions to see if he exceeded the scope of his assignment.

Halper and Lokhova know each other through Cambridge University and the Cambridge Intelligence Seminars, which involved gatherings of academics and intelligence officials and were put together by Halper and Sir Richard Dearlove, a former director of MI6 who spent decades with the British spy agency. Christopher Steele, hired by Fusion GPS through the Clinton campaign and the author of the unverified dossier used in Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act applications to target Trump associates, was in MI6 from 1987 until 2009. Dearlove, who left in 2004, called Steele the “go-to person on Russia in the commercial sector” and said his reputation is “superb.”

One 2014 seminar was attended by then-President Barack Obama’s Defense Intelligence Agency Director Mike Flynn, who played a prominent role in Donald Trump’s campaign and was swept up in special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. Lokhova attended as a graduate student and claims Halper used this dinner as a pretext spread rumors to professors and reporters about her.
Lokhova claimed Halper was paid $500,000 by the U.S. government to carry out a variety of actions, including harming her academic career, and asked the court for damages totaling $25.4 million from Halper as well as from the Wall Street Journal, New York Times, Washington Post, and MSNBC, whom she claimed published Halper’s alleged lies she was a “Russian spy” and “traitor” and had an affair with Flynn following their interaction at the 2014 dinner.
Halper responded in August that Lokhova’s accusations were “spurious,” saying she was trying to use the court to grift people through an online crowdfunding effort. He noted the articles cited in her complaint did not allege a Flynn affair or that she was a Russian spy or traitor. He referred to her accusations about a coup against Trump as “implausible conspiracy theories.” He called the lawsuit against him “meritless and profane” and “bad faith litigation,” so he asked the court to dismiss the case and to impose sanctions against Lokhova as punishment.

Though Halper denied colluding with the FBI to overthrow Trump, he neither confirmed nor denied being a bureau informant. He argued in his motion to dismiss the case that if he was a paid informant for the government or was working as a government contractor, he was immune from a lawsuit like hers.
Halper and Dearlove stepped down from the seminars in 2016 amid reports Russian operatives were attempting to compromise the organization. Halper said he left because of “unacceptable Russian influence on the group.” Today, Dearlove is listed as the chairman and Halper is listed as a partner at the Cambridge Security Initiative, which “provides a unique link between the worlds of business, government, and academia with unrivaled expertise in security and intelligence issues.”
When Halper’s role as an FBI informant was leaked to the media in May 2018, it led to accusations from Trump and Republicans in Congress that the Obama administration used Halper as part of an illegal effort to spy on the Trump campaign, dubbed “Spygate” by allies of the president.
A Defense Department audit earlier this year revealed more than $1 million in contracts awarded to Halper between 2012 and 2018, with the Pentagon’s Office of Net Assessment unable to provide “sufficient” documentation of whether Halper was doing the research work he’d been hired to do. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, is continuing to push for answers.

As wildfires get worse, insurers pull back from riskiest areas

Texto completo: Washington • Insurers are quietly reducing their exposure to fire-prone regions across the Western United States, putting new pressure on homeowners and raising concerns that climate change could eventually make insurance unaffordable in some areas.
Officials in California, Washington, Montana and Colorado are getting more complaints from people whose insurance companies have refused to renew their coverage. The complaints follow years of record-setting wildfires in both size and cost, a trend that scientists expect to continue as global warming accelerates.
“I think that we are not far away from a lot of weather-related events being too expensive for most people to purchase comprehensive coverage,” said Carolyn Kousky, executive director of the Wharton Risk Center at the University of Pennsylvania. “What happens then is the big question.”
On Tuesday, California’s Department of Insurance issued a report quantifying that pullback. For the ZIP codes most affected by the wildfires in 2015 and 2017, the number of homeowners dropped by their insurance companies jumped 10% between 2017 and 2018.
In the 10 California counties with the most homes in high-risk areas, the number of homeowners’ policies written by major insurers, whose rate increases must be approved by state regulators, fell by 5% between 2015 and 2018, the department said.
Another way of measuring the growing reluctance of insurers is the increase in demand for the state’s FAIR plan, which is effectively prohibited from turning away customers but typically charges higher premiums as a result. In those same 10 highest-risk counties, the number of homeowners getting coverage through that plan increased 177% while staying flat statewide.
“By not being able to find insurance, you then in turn can’t sell your home. If you can’t sell your home, then it affects the local property taxes,” said Ricardo Lara, California’s insurance commissioner. “This is really creating chaos.”
The trade group representing insurers said the fires of the past two years had compelled companies to reduce their exposure. Whether that pullback is temporary or permanent depends on what the state does next, according to Rex Frazier, president of the Personal Insurance Federation of California.
Frazier said the state should allow insurers to raise rates to better reflect the full cost of wildfire risk. He also called for more aggressive forest management, such as controlled burns to remove trees, brush and other fuel for wildfires, as well as requiring homeowners to keep more space between their houses and the vegetation around them.
The alternative — continuing to build homes in dangerous areas, combined with worsening fire conditions and premiums that do not reflect the true risk of wildfires — is “not the recipe for a healthy market,” Frazier said.
Versions of that trend are playing out across the West. In Washington state, officials have been receiving more complaints from people in wildfire-prone areas about insurance companies, according to Mike Kreidler, the state’s insurance commissioner.
“Some companies are starting to reevaluate their position in certain geographic areas, largely driven by eastern Washington right now, or at least we think so,” Kreidler said.
In response to that concern, his office sent a request to insurers in July, asking for information about whether and how those companies have reduced their coverage in fire-prone areas. He gave companies until early September to report back.
“Are they continuing to insure at the same levels?” Kreidler asked. “Are they backing off on the number of policies they’ll write?”
In Montana, insurers have changed the way they evaluate wildfire risk, according to Bob Biskupiak, the state’s deputy insurance commissioner.
Decisions that were once made based largely on how quickly a fire department could reach the property now involve third-party analytics companies, Biskupiak said. Those companies examine everything from the surrounding timber and grass conditions, the slope of the ground, where the prevailing winds come from and the conditions on nearby land.
“It’s not necessarily the property that’s being evaluated,” Biskupiak said. “It’s about where the fire could potentially start.”
Insurers have used that information to be more discriminating about what they choose to cover. “Company A, B or C has insured me for 10 years — I’ve never had a loss,” Biskupiak said, recounting the type of complaint he’s heard. “And then all of a sudden this year they’re nonrenewing me.”
This month his office issued a public notice warning companies against refusing coverage just because of a wildfire elsewhere in the same ZIP code or county.
“The state auditor’s office has recently received several phone calls and heard from local officials in Lewis and Clark County that some insurance companies are denying coverage for homes, cars, and boats due to the North Hills wildfire, even though the properties weren’t located anywhere near that fire,” the department wrote.
Colorado has also seen an uptick in complaints, according to Peg Brown, the state’s deputy insurance commissioner. She said her office was considering instructing insurers to provide more data on how many people are being dropped so it can measure the change.
“It’s a significant issue,” Brown said. “We’re trying to get a little bit ahead of it.”
The question is whether insurers will move back into those areas if their financial reserves recover and the memory of damage fades, as has sometimes happened after previous large-scale disasters, according to Kousky of the Wharton Risk Center.
She said there’s reason to believe this time is different.
“These perils are changing,” Kousky said. And if the pullback by insurers proves lasting, it would require a greater role for governments in financing reconstruction after disasters, while compelling a shift in where and how we build homes. “There’s not one solution that would nicely solve this,” she said.

“I know that reality is much more complex than that, and I wanted to explore this complexity though fiction,” author Rajia Hassib told Observer, referring to the view that religion is the driving force behind terrorism. Frustrated by this simplistic reaction many people have to acts of terrorism committed by Muslims, Hassib wanted to write a novel centered around a terrorist attack to change this narrative. That is how the idea for A Pure Heart, a story about a family torn apart by a suicide bombing, was born.
This is Hassib’s second novel after In the Language of Miracles, which was a New York Times Editors’ Choice and received an honorable mention from the Arab American Book Awards.

The book, published by Penguin Random House and released on August 6, chronicles the story of Rose and Gameela. They are sisters, but family is the only thing they have in common—their lives couldn’t have taken more different paths. Rose pursued a career in Egyptology, Gameela in engineering. Rose married Mark, an American journalist and moved to New York to work at the Metropolitan Museum while Gameela stayed behind in Cairo with their parents. Rose never wore the burqa, but Gameela did. Rose is alive, but Gameela isn’t.
In the aftermath of the revolution in Egypt, Gameela dies in a suicide bombing, her death leaving behind more questions than answers. Rose returns to Egypt to try to piece together the circumstances behind her demise, in the process unearthing secrets that make her realize she barely knew her sister.
A Pure Heart is as much about places as it is about the people living in them. “In the novel, I’m particularly interested in places that can bring about peace: through immersion in nature, through gaining distance from cities and their fast and often-exhausting pace, or simply through being at a new place that one calls home—something that infuses the space with hope for a better future. I think such a place, one that is tied to a positive transition, to a hopeful future, becomes its own character, in a way,” Hassib said.
While the vivid descriptions do transport the reader instantly to the markets of Cairo or to the cafes on 5th Avenue, what makes the book so compelling is that the reader gets to see the same places through different pairs of eyes. Take Cairo for instance. When the narrative is fixed on Gameela, we see an Egypt through rose-tinted glasses—“the feeling of blissful belonging, an anchored identification with all that surrounded her.” Through Rose’s husband, Mark, we get the perspective of an outsider—“That was another thing Mark loved about Egypt; how friends and families merged and intersected, how people never seemed to be lonely. Almost like an exaggerated version of West Virginia.” And, through Rose, we see Egypt through the eyes of someone caught in between—someone who’s made a career about her country, but struggles to fully understand its people’s unique customs and beliefs.
While the mystery in the novel surrounds Gameela, the character of intrigue is Rose. Hassib said that while Rose’s character wasn’t autobiographical, she did shape the immigrant aspect of her life from personal experience. Caught between being seen as an outsider in the U.S. and as an American by her friends and family, Rose struggles to balance these two parts of her identity. “Rose thinks we are all more alike than most of us realize, and I agree.” Hassib said about her protagonist. “I, too, like Rose, often ponder how similar people are, despite the various religious or ethnic labels they embrace or the ones that are forced upon them.” In writing this book, she asks us to consider the question more deeply, too.

China pressuring corporations to crack down on Hong Kong protesters

Texto completo: A major airline company is investigating “rumors circulating online” that employees are drafting a letter supporting the Hong Kong protests as China pressures business leaders to help stifle the political crisis.
“They're actually using these relationships for the interests of the Communist Party,” retired Air Force Gen. Rob Spalding, a China expert at the Hudson Institute, told the Washington Examiner.
Cathay Pacific Airlines has been one of the most prominent targets of Chinese pressure in recent weeks, as the Hong Kong-based company angered Beijing by affirming that their employees have a right to think what they want about the pro-democracy protests that have rocked the semi-autonomous city for months. Two senior executives were forced to resign on Friday, while the airline is on the lookout for employees who express opinions that the mainland Communist regime opposes.
“While we cannot confirm the authenticity of this letter, we are taking the matter very seriously and are conducting an internal investigation,” the airline said Sunday. “Cathay Pacific is deeply concerned by the ongoing violence and disruption impacting Hong Kong.”
That’s a far cry from the company’s position two weeks ago, when Cathay chairman John Slosar said the company “wouldn’t dream of telling [employees] what they have to think about something.” Communist aviation authorities subsequently branded the airline as a “severe risk” and banned Cathay employees that participated in the protests from working on flights between Hong Kong and the mainland.
They’re not the only ones trying to signal compliance with Beijing’s demands. Four major international accounting firms distanced themselves from a local newspaper ad that a group of their employees published in support of the protests on the same day that Cathay Pacific CEO Rupert Hogg and chief customer and commercial officer Paul Loo Kar-pui announced their resignations.
“Most firms in Hong Kong that engage in business with mainland China know that there is always a degree of political risk that needs to be navigated," Duncan Innes-Ker, regional director for Asia at The Economist Intelligence Unit, said Monday. "Companies may find that their employees’ activism turns into a political risk in mainland China, if this campaigning becomes associated with the firm’s brand.”
Cathay Pacific is particularly susceptible to pressure from the mainland regime, because state-owned Air China owns a 22% stake in the airline. “They’re basically saying, ‘Look, if you don't get on our side, no matter how these protests end up, your business is going to be hurt,’ because what they're looking for is to put as much pressure on the protesters as they can,” Spalding told the Washington Examiner.
“And one way to put pressure on them is to make sure they don't have a job.”
Some protesters are prepared to take that risk. “In that case, I’ll look for another job,” Joseph Lai, a 46-year-old Hong Kong resident told the New York Times. “If we don’t come, how can we say we’re Hong Kong people?”
The protests began has a reaction against an extradition bill that would have allowed mainland authorities to take custody of Hong Kong residents on flimsy evidence, but they have continued throughout the summer, fed by anger over police brutality and the Beijing-backed local government’s refusal to scrap the extradition bill permanently.
The protesters endured a public relations defeat last weekend, as clashes in the Hong Kong airport played into mainland Chinese claims that the demonstrators are rioters who need to be punished, but they regrouped to muster an estimated 1.7 million people for peaceful protests on Sunday.
Spalding likened the Cathay controversy issue to the “social credit system” that Communist officials use to influence the behavior of mainland Chinese residents, an authoritarian tactic to “restore morality” by depriving “uncivilized” people of the ability to purchase plane tickets or conduct normal business.
The tactic of pressuring the company to crack down on employees that back the protests could foreshadow Chinese government efforts to affect how companies behave in controversies around the world.
“You're seeing the elements of the way that they seek to influence the world through these Hong Kong protests,” Spalding said.

Texto completo: Last year, after an earlier stock market swoon brought on by headlines about the U.S.-China trade conflict, I laid out three rules for thinking about such events. First, the stock market is not the economy. Second, the stock market is not the economy. Third, the stock market is not the economy.
But maybe I should add a fourth rule: The bond market sorta kinda is the economy.
An old economists’ joke says that the stock market predicted nine of the last five recessions. Well, an “inverted yield curve” — when interest rates on short-term bonds are higher than on long-term bonds — predicted six of the last six recessions. And a plunge in long-term yields, which are now less than half what they were last fall, has inverted the yield curve once again, with the short-versus-long spread down to roughly where it was in early 2007, on the eve of a disastrous financial crisis and the worst recession since the 1930s.
Neither I nor anyone else is predicting a replay of the 2008 crisis. It’s not even clear whether we’re heading for recession. But the bond market is telling us that the smart money has become very gloomy about the economy’s prospects. Why? The Federal Reserve basically controls short-term rates, but not long-term rates; low long-term yields mean that investors expect a weak economy, which will force the Fed into repeated rate cuts.
So what accounts for this wave of gloom? Much though not all of it is a vote of no confidence in Donald Trump’s economic policies.
You may recall that last year, after a couple of quarters of good economic news, Trump officials were boasting that the 2017 tax cut had laid the foundation for many years of high economic growth.
Since then, however, the data have pretty much confirmed what critics had been saying all along. Yes, the tax cut gave the economy a boost — a “sugar high.” Running trillion-dollar deficits will do that. But the boost was temporary. In particular, the promised boom in business investment never materialized. And now the economy has reverted, at best, to its pre-stimulus growth rate.
At the same time, it has become increasingly clear that Trump’s belligerence about foreign trade isn’t a pose; it reflects real conviction. Protectionism seems to be up there with racism as part of the essential Trump. And the realization that he really is a Tariff Man is having a serious dampening effect on business spending, partly because nobody knows just how far he’ll go.

Utah’s Planned Parenthood says it will remain open despite loss of federal family planning funds

Texto completo: The Planned Parenthood Association of Utah on Monday said its clinic doors will remain open, despite its decision to decline federal Title X funding that would come attached to new restrictions on abortion referrals.
“I am heartbroken that we have to withdraw today from Title X, but we refuse to let the Trump administration bully us into withholding abortion information from our patients in Utah," Karrie Galloway, president and CEO for the Planned Parenthood Association of Utah, said in a prepared statement.
News broke Monday that national Planned Parenthood had decided to exit the federal reproductive health program in light of the rule, rolled out in February by the Department of Health and Human Services. That funding currently accounts for some $60 million of the $286 million distributed through Title X.
Planned Parenthood groups in Utah and elsewhere, which serve more than 1.5 million women annually, have called the measure a “gag rule” designed to silence them on abortions.
While the Trump administration rule doesn’t prohibit conversations about abortion, it does restrict Title X funding recipients from making referrals or telling a patient where to obtain the procedure. Planned Parenthood said this is the first time it has been out of Title X since the program was enacted in 1970 during the Nixon administration.
Planned Parenthood says no taxpayer money goes toward abortions, but its providers do discuss abortions with patients and sometimes refer them for the procedure.
The Planned Parenthood Association of Utah (PPAU) uses Title X funds to care for about 37,000 Utahns each year, providing birth control and other preventive care, and it has been the state’s lone recipient of these federal grants since the 1980s. The federal funding — which was to total $2 million for the coming year — represents about a fifth of the PPAU budget, the organization has said.
“Our doors are still open today, and they will be open tomorrow. We will do everything we can to make sure our patients don’t lose care,” Galloway said in the prepared statement.
Interviewed Monday, Galloway said the loss of funding will force PPAU to do some “belt-tightening,” but that the organization isn’t making any knee-jerk decisions and doesn’t expect to discontinue any services. PPAU will probably have to lean more heavily on its donors and seek insurance reimbursement from clients who have health coverage, she said.
In any case, PPAU will find a way to survive financially, Galloway said. The more upsetting thing, she said, is that the Trump administration injected politics into a health care program that serves more than 4 million patients each year, about 1.5 million of them through Planned Parenthood.
“Private political messaging on the backs of the most vulnerable women and families is reprehensible,” she said.
Gayle Ruzicka, an organizer of the Abortion-Free Utah campaign, said while PPAU is the only Title X recipient in Utah, she’s not worried that women will lose access to health services, arguing that other clinics provide similar reproductive health care without making abortion referrals.
The Trump administration’s rule change was not a political decision, Ruzicka contends.
“Trying to protect unborn babies and protect the mothers of those unborn babies from a terrible decision like abortion," she said, “I don’t call that political, I call that good health care.”
Planned Parenthood and the American Medical Association have sued the Trump administration over the Title X rule, with oral arguments in those cases slated for September, according to a news release. These groups say the restriction would force physicians and clinics to withhold medical information from patients and possibly deny women the ability to choose from a range of options available. They also say it would interfere with the doctor-patient relationship.

Texto completo: As a freshman in college, after the Las Vegas shooting in 2017, I wrote a poem titled "Please Mr. President" that was published in The New York Times and then the Daily Herald.
I clung to an idealism meant for storybooks, addressing an envelope with my poem to the White House, half-believing that our president would read and share my words.
He didn’t. I’m still not sure why I was surprised.
I’d directed my hope and plea for change at our president. Two years later, I’ve come to realize that my hopes and pleas mean nothing to the people in power.
When I was 14 years old, standing in my kitchen, my parents told me about the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School. We reached the absolute worst — a massacre of children — in 2012, and then because the leaders of our country placed priority on other matters, we watched Las Vegas happen.
We watched Parkland happen. And then Sante Fe. And then Pittsburgh. And then Virginia Beach.
Most recently, we learned that 22 people were gunned down in El Paso, Texas, and another nine in Dayton, Ohio.
I have friends in Dayton and in Texas. I was scared for them.
I was scared for all of us.
Each time a tragic event occurs, we follow a script that begins with well-meaning words from people in power and ends without action. During a vigil in Dayton, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine’s words were overshadowed by people shouting, "Do something."
This discussion has been under way for a long time, but it’s difficult to move forward when progress is stalled by one excuse or another. It’s difficult to prioritize empathy, integrity and a sense of moral responsibility in a dialogue where money seems to supersede everything else.
Lately, politicians and civilians alike have resorted to blaming particular groups of people, hoping to pinpoint the problem and shift blame. We don’t have time for that. We have allowed the analysis, blaming and media coverage of mass shootings to become a partisan issue.
Yet it always has been, and will remain, a moral issue in which politics has no place. Set aside the right and left for a moment and realize that our own people are dying because of these divisions.
America, we must bind together and demand that this violence ends. We are blessed to look at that flag of red, white and blue fluttering in the breeze and remember the strength and power it represents.
America, we have so much potential for good, but we each have to want it.
A little over a week ago at Wrigley Field, I rose for the national anthem, feeling hopeful and hopeless at the same time. I watched our American flag fly at half-staff in light of the Ohio and Texas shootings.
In a moment void of partisan politics, I listened to acoustic guitar notes and patriotic lyrics waft over the baseball diamond. I watched 40,000 baseball fans rise together, bound by a pride and love for our nation.
It was one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen.
It was during those few moments that I realized we each owe it to ourselves and our country to start demanding changes immediately.
The time for politicians’ well-meaning words is over. People are tired of well-meaning words because well-meaning words represent a fear to do something more.
America, I don’t want to appeal to the emotions of Congress or the president. I want to appeal to you. To your emotions and your hearts.
To the parents who send their kids on buses to school, trusting each day that their children’s education will not be compromised because of gun violence. To the families taking their kids to the movies, to concerts, to shopping malls, praying that their city won’t be in the headlines the next day because of gun violence.
I don’t think it wise for any of us to wait for Congress to change its predictable pattern. It has been given ample chances to step forward and make concrete changes to prevent gun violence. It won’t bring changes to the table on its own.
And if it won’t, then America, we must.
The movement for change starts from the ground up, and it starts with the people. And not just the people or towns affected by gun violence but every person in every city. So let’s start with the small steps.
We can fill the inboxes of congressmen and women with requests for new laws. We can write letters to senators asking for sessions on gun regulation. We can speak peacefully and directly to our governors about taking action to solve this problem instead of talking about it, just as a group of people did during Gov. DeWine’s speech.
Countless gun reform groups are already advocating for change. Everytown for Gun Safety, started in 2006, has nearly 6 million supporters. America, we can join them.
For the safety and protection of our citizens, we each must step forward and speak until the people in power cannot ignore us.

A system of exploitation, despair and hope

Texto completo: Special to the Star Tribune
This ambitious and successful book profiles an extended Filipino family inching toward prosperity by laboring out of country for years, migrating to do arduous work in harsh places. It's the opposite of an instant book; it has been cooking for three decades. The chef has combined, in considered proportion, ingredients gathered around the world -- revealing family and work scenes set in the Philippines, Oman and Saudi Arabia, aboard wandering cruise ships and deep in the heart of Texas. And right when we're hungry for them, he serves up telling social and economic digressions that place the family's struggles in a political and economic context of global migration.
Author Jason DeParle, a New York Times reporter, writes in the prologue to "A Good Provider Is One Who Leaves": "My own light bulb moment came in learning that remittances -- the sums migrants send home -- are three times the world's foreign aid budgets combined. Migration is the world's largest antipoverty program, a homegrown version of foreign aid."
This is a huge topic that looms in the lives of his subjects, but it is out of sight for many American readers, some of whom these days are systematically fed disinformation about migrants. DeParle has found a way to humanize and clarify this vast and complicated subject.
In 1987, as a young reporter covering poverty, DeParle sought to stay in a shanty in the muddy Manila neighborhood called Leveriza. A local leader, Tita Portagana Comodas, who scrubbed and cooked all day for her sprawling family, took him in. She also bought a few thousand eggs every week to resell in the neighborhood food co-op, and "stacked them under a kitchen light to protect them from the rats," DeParle writes. "In the post-Marcos Philippines, her hopes and the country's were equally fragile."
Tita's husband and many other relatives had gone off, working abroad for years at a stretch and sending sustaining checks home.
The remittance checks got members of the Portagana family by -- and in the course of the book, staked some members' successful struggles toward solvency. Nationally, these remittance funds kept the poor from hunger and exported potential activists, blunting political trouble, aiding a dictatorship in Manila that fiercely protected the export of labor. Far across the Pacific, the jobs that paid poorly by our standards drew often undocumented workers, suppressing American wages. Solving the equations for who gains and who pays a price is complicated. DeParle is our Virgil on a tour of this harsh, globally interdependent, paradox-filled system of exploitation and hope.
Readers will likely be pleased when DeParle's main character, Rosalie (Tita's youngest child), by dint of her dogged responsibility, blindered determination and deep kindness, finally, after decades of exhausting struggle, trailed by kids and a pokey husband, and all the while ceaselessly sending check after check back home, finally passes nursing and English exams and immigrates to work as a nurse in Texas.
While we enjoy Rosalie's success, we are likely also to feel the frustration and despair that come with comprehending systemic problems that seem intractable and almost too diffuse to reform.
DeParle has a frank, amiable and plain-spoken virtuosity as a writer, twice has almost won the Pulitzer and has won Polk and Livingston awards. "A Good Provider Is One Who Leaves" deserves a place on the same high shelf as Kate Boo's "Behind the Beautiful Forevers" and David Finkel's "The Good Soldiers" -- recent books that enrapture readers with moving narrative while elegantly elucidating deep, humane and informed understandings of poverty and conflict. These books represent the highest and most powerful use of the oft-read but rarely identified genre of narrative journalism.
Mark Kramer has been writer-in-residence at Smith College, Boston University and the Nieman Program on Narrative Journalism at Harvard. He has helped found ongoing narrative journalism conferences in Boston, London, Amsterdam and Bergen, Norway.

Longtime foreign correspondent for NPR looks to home when she writes her own stories

Texto completo: During her more than three decades as a journalist for National Public Radio, Jacki Lyden told a lot of people’s stories.
As a foreign correspondent, she covered the unrest in Northern Ireland and she reported on the Gulf War in the Middle East, spending time in Iraq, Iran, Kuwait, Syria and Afghanistan, among other countries.
Much of her work revolved around deadline reporting that delivered the news of the day to NPR listeners. But the kind of stories she especially enjoyed telling were about the people caught up in the day-to-day turmoil of history-making events.
“I wanted to do stories on women’s lives,” says Lyden, who will visit Lancaster Saturday to deliver the opening keynote at HippoCamp: A Conference for Creative Nonfiction Writers. “I wanted to do stories on civil society; that was a strong one for me for many years. I did eight pieces in Iran ... We called it ‘Iran at the Crossroads,’ and it was really all about their attempts to build a civil society.”
She remembers encountering a Palestinian man in 1991 at the border of Iraq and Kuwait who told her he was “losing his life story, losing all his family stories.”
That encounter resonated with her, and though she continued to tell other people’s stories, Lyden decided she had to write her own.
Her story revolved around a bipolar mother whose mental illness defined Lyden’s childhood.
“I realized if I don’t do something with that, it’ll be lost,” she says. “And here I spend all this time and I’m a world away. I’ve gone through a lot of dangers telling other people’s stories, and I’m glad I did. But gosh, I’ve got to hit pause and tell my own.”
She spent seven years writing “Daughter of the Queen of Sheba,” which was published in 1997. A reviewer for the New York Times wrote that the memoir “is about madness both clinical and familial, and the author captures her mother’s insanity and her own response to it in exquisite detail. The writing — vivid, original, lyrical — shines at its most haunting.”
------------
Hippocamp
For her talk at HippoCamp at the Lancaster County Convention Center, Lyden says she plans to focus on “what journalism can learn from nonfiction and what nonfiction can learn from journalism.”
Lyden, who grew up in Wisconsin and now lives in Washington, D.C. with her husband, Bill O’Leary, a photographer for the Washington Post, says she believes the importance of journalism and nonfiction writing is especially urgent today.
“We are seeing the very notion of truth undermined,” she says. “And if you undermine truth, then you really haven’t got the lifeblood of storytelling — unless you’re telling fiction and everybody agrees it is.”
HippoCamp is sponsored by Hippocampus Magazine, an online magazine dedicated to creative nonfiction that was founded in 2010 by Lancaster writer Donna Talarico.
Hippocamp is a three-day extravaganza for nonfiction writers that includes the keynote talks and numerous sessions aimed at equipping conference participants with all they need to improve their writing and navigate the publishing world. The first HippoCamp was held in 2015.

Second memoir
Lyden says she was apprehensive about publishing “Daughter of the Queen of Sheba” because she didn’t know what to expect. Memoirs were not as abundant in the late 1990s as they are now, and she felt like she had “peeled off my skin in front of my work peers.”
She says, however, that she could not have been more pleased with the response to the book.
“What I was surprised by was it was of use to other people,” she says. “If 100 people had read “Daughter of the Queen of Sheba, I would have been happy. I would have been perfectly happy. I wrote a lot of it in notebooks. I wrote in Baghdad. I wrote in London. Sometimes I wouldn’t have a chance to write for months. It took me seven years to write that book.”
Lyden, who worked for NPR from 1979 to 2014 and still contributes on an occasional basis, conducts writers workshops but spends the bulk of her time writing.
She says she is in the “homestretch” of a second memoir, titled “Tell Me Something Good.” She is in the process of finding a publisher.
This book also revolves around her mother, who is 89 and has Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus, which produces too much spinal fluid in the brain and causes physical and mental impairments, including thinking and reasoning problems.
“It’s about the challenges and the redemptions of pulling a family through its last chapters of life, especially when you’re the chief narrator and storyteller, and maybe your younger sisters think they have a point of view, too, and that you’re not the only narrator.
“My mom has fabulous days and poor ones, and it’s not necessarily because of her physical health. She survived as a person with a severe mental illness. ... Just like when I was younger, the great days are great and the bad days are full of these black angers that we just don’t seem to be able to soothe.”
As with the first book, Lyden says she’s apprehensive about what people will think of the second one.
“I worry about how my family will react to some degree,” she says. “I worry about people who might have a different view of caregiving than I do. I worry about people who think I’m going to look like I’m aggrandizing myself.
“It’s constantly in my mind.”
Lyden says her next book will be a novel.

Texto completo: Cambridge author Karen M. McManus describes “One of Us Is Lying," her best-selling mystery novel, as “'The Breakfast Club' with murder."
It's an intriguing pitch, one that originally sold Delacorte Press, which published the book back in May 2017. It proceeded to spend more than a year on The New York Times bestseller list.
Now, McManus's novel is shaping up to become the next “Pretty Little Liars"-size TV hit, with news that NBCUniversal is ordering a pilot episode of “One of Us Is Lying" as it weighs possible series to premiere on its upcoming streaming service (set to arrive in April).
The story centers on five students who walk into detention, only for one of them to wind up dead. The remaining students, all with something to hide, become suspects in his murder, especially once it's learned the victim — the creator of a notorious school gossip app — had planned to distribute dirt on all four the following day.
“It's really exciting to be taking this next step," said McManus by phone Friday. “The tricky thing about [having a series] in development is that there are lots of things you can't talk about. So, for readers, it can feel like nothing's happening, even when it is."
Once her book reached bestseller status, McManus — who's lived in Cambridge for more than 20 years — found herself courted by multiple teams with an interest in adapting the story. She ultimately went with Universal Content Productions (UCP), in part because of its interest in working with McManus to preserve the story's tone and heart.
“They're really committed to a collaborative process," she said. “Everyone involved really cares about these characters the way I do." With what she calls “four really distinct personalities driving the plot," that was essential.
McManus, who graduated from Northeastern University with a journalism degree, feels it's best to ground stories, especially whodunits, in realistically drawn characters.
“I find [journalism] to be such a good background for writers," she said. “It also teaches you to look for holes in your story, which is really important when you're writing a mystery."
NBCUniversal's streaming service is entering a crowded marketplace, competing directly with Net­flix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime along with forthcoming services by Disney, Apple, and HBO. As it attempts to stand out, bingeworthy shows will be essential.
“I think it's a really good fit [for streaming]," she said. “When I wrote the book, one of the things I tried to do at the end of every chapter was make a mini-cliffhanger that would make it hard for people to stop reading."
Should NBCUniversal order a full season of the series, McManus expects it to air sometime next year — though she'd be surprised if its premiere coincided with the streaming service's launch in April.
McManus has other irons in the fire, too. PictureStart — a media company started this past May by ex-Lionsgate president Erik Feig — has acquired the rights to adapt “Two Can Keep a Secret," a standalone suspense novel she published in January.
And to ring in next year, she'll publish a direct sequel, “One of Us Is Next," which picks up a year after “Lying" with a new cast of characters. “It's not necessarily a season two," she warned. All the same, discussions are underway with UCP that could lead to it being adapted in some form.
“You look at something like [Netflix's] “To All the Boys I Loved Before,"' said McManus. “It started as a movie, but now there will be two more [films], because people loved it. Or [Netflix's] '13 Reasons Why,' you weren't sure there was going to be more, and it got three seasons."
Whatever happens, McManus is content for the time being to enjoy her success as a best-selling — and now full-time — novelist. After “One of Us Is Lying" broke big, Delacorte offered her a two-book contract, and with Hollywood calling, McManus left her previous job, at Monotype in Woburn.
“There was too much work, and something had to give," she said. “It wasn't going to be the dream job."

Texto completo: What's on TV
CITY ON A HILL 9 p.m. on Showtime. A slew of heavyweight actors and the robust backdrop of Boston have shaped an ambitious first season for "City on a Hill," which is airing its finale tonight. The drama follows Decourcy Ward (Aldis Hodge), an assistant district attorney, and Jackie Rohr (Kevin Bacon), a veteran F.B.I. agent, as they each find their own way to navigate the city's criminal justice system, which is rife with corruption. Mike Hale writes in a review for The New York Times that the show "keeps threatening to be interesting and exciting, but so far it hasn't pulled off the job."
THE ROOK 8 p.m. on Starz. The first season of this fantasy spy thriller starring Emma Greenwell is coming to an end. Greenwell plays Myfanwy Thomas, a woman with supernatural powers who is trying to regain her memory. She shares the screen with the sci-fi favorite Olivia Munn as Monica Reed, an agent from the American sister agency to the Checquy, the British secret service that protects the country from sinister magic. In the finale, Myfawny is still searching for clues to her past, even as her powerful enemies at the Checquy get closer to capturing her.
SWEETBITTER 9:30 p.m. on Starz. As the final two episodes of Season 2 premiere, Tess (Ella Purnell) is still feeling lost, unsure of her future at the trendy New York restaurant where she works and indecisive about her love life. She is determined to keep the chaos of working in food at bay -- but that may require some serious sacrifice.
What's Streaming
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
MINDHUNTER Stream on Netflix. Another season of this hit show, which takes a deep-dive into the minds of some of the world's most notorious serial killers, has returned to Netflix. One of the newest subjects this season for Holden Ford (Jonathan Groff) and Bill Tench (Holt McCallany), both F.B.I. agents, and Wendy Carr (Anna Torv), a psychologist, is none other than Charles Manson, played by Damon Herriman. In a review for The Times, James Poniewozik reassures viewers who may want to avoid the typical gore associated with killer-focused shows that "'Mindhunter' thus far is more interested in the process of getting inside skulls than the process of removing them."
FIND ME IN PARIS Stream on Hulu. The first season of this charming show saw Helena Grinsky (Jessica Lord), a Russian princess and ballet dancer at Opéra de Paris, transported from the year 1905 to 2018 thanks to Henri (Christy O'Donnell), her time-traveling boyfriend. While he attempts to get her back to 1905, Helena tries to adapt to the contemporary age, and she also may have found a modern love in Max (Rory J. Saper), a dance student. This season, Helena has to decide if she really wants to return to the past at all.

Chinese Free Camps' Critic But Gag Him

Texto completo: HONG KONG -- An activist who drew attention to the plight of Muslims held in Chinese indoctrination camps has been freed after months of detention in Kazakhstan, but his lawyer refused to sign his plea deal, saying she believed he had been threatened into accepting it.
The activist, Serikzhan Bilash, walked out of a courtroom late Friday in Almaty, Kazakhstan, surrounded by dozens of cheering supporters. He did not respond to messages seeking comment on Saturday. But the news agency Agence France-Presse quoted him as saying that under the terms of his plea agreement, he would have to stop his activism.
"It was that or seven years in jail," he was quoted as saying. "I had no choice."
Mr. Bilash, a naturalized Kazakh citizen who was born in China, had been a prominent advocate for people being held in a vast network of camps in the Xinjiang region in northwestern China. The Chinese authorities initially denied that the camps existed, but they now describe them as job and legal skills training programs meant to steer people away from extremism.
Scholars estimate that as many as one million Uighurs, Kazakhs and members of other predominately Muslim ethnic groups are being held in the camps, where former detainees have said that they were subjected to indoctrination programs meant to replace Islamic piety with devotion to the Chinese Communist Party.
The Chinese government recently said that it had released many of the detainees, but New York Times reporters who recently visited the region found it blanketed with secrecy, and the camps were continuing to operate.
Mr. Bilash and the group he leads, Atajurt Kazakh Human Rights, compiled testimony of former camp inmates and the family members of people still being held in order to put pressure on the Chinese authorities to release them.
The videos -- recorded in Kazakh, with many translated into Russian, Chinese and English -- are some of the most powerful and direct evidence of the camps and the suffering caused by the widespread detentions.
In March, the police in Kazakhstan detained Mr. Bilash and took him to the capital, Nur-Sultan, where he was placed under house arrest. He pleaded guilty on Friday to a charge of inciting ethnic discord.
His lawyer, Aiman Umarova, said Saturday that she had refused to sign Mr. Bilash's plea deal and that it had been arranged without her knowledge. Ms. Umarova said she believed Mr. Bilash had been threatened into accepting it.
"My position was no plea bargain, because he was innocent," Ms. Umarova said by telephone. "But he wanted to be free, and I understand to him to be free is most important. It is his choice, it is not my choice."
Mr. Bilash's calls to wage an information campaign against the Chinese authorities had posed a dilemma for the Kazakh government, which worked quietly to help its citizens get out of China while also avoiding criticism of its more powerful neighbor.
Before his detention, Mr. Bilash said he believed the Chinese government was applying pressure to silence critics of the detention camps and prevent the outside world from knowing what was happening there.
"They just want to close Atajurt," he said in February. "They just want to close Serikzhan's mouth and they just wanted so nobody would stand up against Chinese re-education camps."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

With a divided Congress, reports of the filibuster's demise might be premature

Texto completo: Opponents of the legislative filibuster have made big gains this summer in their effort to abolish the Senate's requirement for supermajorities to approve major legislation.
But any obituary of the filibuster might be premature, because recent history suggests Senate leaders will only pull the trigger on nixing the filibuster's powers when there is a guaranteed big victory to follow. And it's unclear when all the stars will align for such a major win.
The boldest proposals on the right - repealing the Affordable Care Act, creating private investment accounts instead of Social Security - failed to win simple majority support when Republicans controlled all the levers of power in Washington. And the most ambitious proposals among 2020 Democratic presidential aspirants, such as Medicare-for-all, remain well short of majority support in the House and Senate.
Several top Democratic contenders have pledged to at least consider leading the effort to abolish the filibuster, and former Senate majority leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) joined the cause in an op-ed calling for its end.
"If the Senate cannot address the most important issues of our time, then it is time for the chamber itself to change," Reid wrote in the New York Times.
That echoes the themes advanced by the most strident opponents of the filibuster, who are afraid that if Democrats win the White House and the Senate in the 2020 elections Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who would then become minority leader, would still stymie their aggressive agenda with filibusters.
"When Democrats next have power, we should be bold," Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said in April at the Rev. Al Sharpton's National Action Network gathering. Predicting that McConnell would revert to his behavior during the Obama administration, Warren added, "Then we should get rid of the filibuster."
Every majority leader of the last 15 years began his reign praising tradition and touting the Senate's role as the cooling saucer to the House's more partisan impulses but eventually tried to rip apart the rules protecting minority rights to filibuster.
Each of those majority leaders - Bill Frist (R-Tenn.), Reid and McConnell - eventually reached a point where they saw a big victory in front of them if they could only have a 51-vote threshold. Frist wanted to break a blockade of Democratic filibusters of George W. Bush's circuit court nominees, a battle that ended with a negotiated compromise among centrists in May 2005.
By 2013, with Republicans filibustering Barack Obama's nominees to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, Reid initiated the "nuclear option" to lower the threshold to ending debate to just 51 votes on all nominees except those to the Supreme Court. Democrats have now appointed a majority of judges on what is considered the second-most-important federal bench.
And in 2017, faced with a blockade of Neil M. Gorsuch, McConnell rounded up GOP support for eradicating filibuster rights on Supreme Court nominees, clearing the way for Gorsuch and then Brett M. Kavanaugh to win confirmation on narrow, almost party-line votes.
Those moves left the 60-vote filibuster in place for legislation only, what traditionalists in both parties say is the last thing preventing the Senate from just turning into the more partisan-driven House.
Many conservatives, including Trump, pushed McConnell to eliminate the legislative filibuster when Republicans held the majority in both chambers. But, as the 2017 effort to repeal the ACA demonstrated, Republicans did not have 51 votes to pass that legislation under special budget rules, so it became a moot point.
With Democrats now controlling the House, McConnell faces no pressure to eliminate the legislative filibuster. As long as Congress is split, only legislation with broad bipartisan support can pass the House and Senate, making the filibuster pointless.
House Republicans, dealing with a rash of retirements, are not behaving like a group expecting to win back the majority anytime soon.
So that makes Democrats the only party seriously considering going "nuclear" on the legislative filibuster. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) has been coy about his intentions should Democrats win a clean sweep in 2020, but the pressure will be enormous to end the filibuster.
The question will be, for what legislation?
Warren supports the Medicare-for-all proposal from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), but aside from those two high-profile candidates for president, there are just 12 other co-sponsors for the legislation. And worrying about the Senate whip count presumes the legislation would pass in the House. It probably wouldn't.
Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), the House sponsor of Medicare-for-all, has 117 co-sponsors, a bare majority of the Democratic caucus but still 100 votes shy of the minimum needed for passage.
The House and Senate resolutions calling for a "Green New Deal" to combat climate change have 95 and 13 supporters, respectively. Some Senate Democrats are quietly discussing the use of special budget rules to approve portions of climate legislation, such as a tax on carbon, on a simple-majority basis that would not require blowing up the legislative filibuster.
House Democrats, as of now, also are short of the 218 votes needed to pass an assault weapons ban.
The most likely issue that could push Schumer into a nuclear war might be immigration. Back in 2013, a bipartisan majority of 68 senators, including 14 Republicans, supported legislation giving a path to citizenship for about 11 million undocumented immigrants if they spent 10 years meeting a set of requirements.
But only four or five Republicans who supported that bill will be in the Senate in two years, and if Republicans filibustered an immigration bill, Schumer might be left with no other choice but to void that option.
Of course, the biggest thing the filibuster has going for it is divided government. Democrats need a net gain of three seats to get to a 50-50 Senate, in which case the presidential winner would take the majority based on the vice president casting the tie-breaking vote.
That's possible based on the seats currently in play, but there's one ironic possibility: Warren, the biggest advocate for eliminating the filibuster, would resign from the Senate in January 2021 if she were to win the presidency, and a 50-50 Senate would disappear.
Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker (R) would immediately appoint a Republican to replace her. Under state law, a special election would be held about five months later.
That would leave McConnell as majority leader for President Warren's first 100 days and possibly beyond, depending on that special election.

Texto completo: Remember when Jay-Z was a dynamic hip-hop artist whose stark lyrics gave voice to the oppressed and downtrodden?
Well, those days are over.
He may have 99 Problems — but a conscience certainly ain’t one.
Completing his transformation to total sellout, Jay-Z climbed into bed with those racial progressives over at the NFL in what was clearly nothing more than a money grab for one side and a public-relations coup for the other.
Sorry, Kaep.
Social justice has been banished to the sidelines.
“I think we’ve moved past kneeling and I think it’s time to go into actionable items,” Jay-Z said Wednesday in a ludicrously weak attempt to spin his hefty NFL payoff into some sort of profile in courage.
With a totally straight face — and NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell by his side — the rap icon and entrepreneur said his partnership with the league is actually a progressive step to carry on the campaign that npw-banished quarterback Colin Kaepernick courageously began by kneeling during the national anthem to bring attention to police brutality and glaring racial inequities in the U.S. justice system.
“I think everyone knows what the issue is — we’re done with that,” Jay-Z said. “We all know the issue now. OK, next.”
Hmm, where have we heard that before?
Oh, yeah, from opponents of the civil rights movement, who derided those protesting against whites-only lunch counters and seats in the back of the bus as nothing more than rabble-rousers who should have been focused on real issues afflicting the African-American community.
“Now that we all know what’s going on, what are we going to do?” Jay-Z said, putting his foot further in his mouth. “How are we going to stop it? Because the kneeling was not about a job, it was about injustice.”
Hey, maybe the NFL should take its deal with Roc Nation to a whole new level by pairing Jay-Z with Jon Voight, another celebrity who turned in what little was left of his cred card by declaring recently that racism was “solved long ago by our forefathers.”
We can see the ad now:
“Welcome to another season of exciting NFL football! Featuring the social justice stylings of Jay-Z, who’ll show us all how to make a buck off police beating up black people. And the racially harmonious world of Jon Voight, asking the question that’s been on everyone’s mind: Why can’t we all just get along? And finally, we’ll bring you the smiling face of Roger Goodell, reminding everyone for the 847th time that Colin Kaepernick is not in the NFL because he’s just not good enough.”
Now, back to reality.
Safety Eric Reid, who joined Kaepernick in his protest but managed to keep a job in the NFL, took aim at Jay-Z for teaming up with the league without getting some sort of assurance that his former 49ers teammate would get another crack at taking the field.
Jay-Z framed it this way: “So what are we gonna do? ... (Help) millions and millions of people, or we get stuck on Colin not having a job?”
Reid replied on Twitter: “These aren’t mutually exclusive. They can both happen at the same time! It looks like your goal was to make millions and millions of dollars by assisting the NFL in burying Colin’s career.”
Touche.
Maybe we’re being too hard on Jay-Z, who has long pulled off that delicate balancing act between social consciousness (his Trayvon Martin documentary series) and the potential pitfalls of good old capitalism (his 2013 collaboration with Barney’s was widely panned over allegations that the luxury store discriminated against black shoppers).
He has been on the right side of many issues, but never let it stand in the way of making a buck.
Jay-Z was reportedly peeved at rapper Travis Scott for performing with Maroon 5 during the Super Bowl in February, after many black artists bailed on the halftime show over the league’s treatment of Kaepernick. But now that he has all that cash in his pocket, Jay-Z says his stance had nothing to do with the ex-quarterback.
“My problem is (Scott) had the biggest year to me last year, and he’s playing on a stage that had an M on it,” Jay-Z said. “I didn’t see any reason for him to play second fiddle to anyone that year, and that was my argument.”
Jay-Z says he won’t be performing at this season’s Super Bowl, but his company — home to Rihanna, DJ Khaled and other stars — will co-produce the halftime show and serve as a consultant on other entertainment projects with the league, as well as working with its Inspire Change initiative.
“The NFL has a great big platform, and it has to be all-inclusive,” Jay-Z told The New York Times when his deal with the league was announced. “They were willing to do some things, to make some changes, that we can do some good.”
Too bad he won’t be pushing for an NFL that includes Kaepernick.

King tells rapists and survivors that rape's OK

Texto completo: Accused rapists have long defended themselves by claiming it didn't happen, or the victim "asked for it," maybe by dressing too provocatively. But never, to my knowledge, has a defense rested on a claim that rape itself isn't such a bad thing.
Rep. Steve King said as much Wednesday by suggesting that forcible sexual intercourse with women was a necessary means of perpetuating the population. Without those resulting offspring, he wondered out loud, "Would there be any population of the world left?"
The Western Iowa Republican also appeared to defend incest. Of both paths to procreation, he said, "I know I can't certify that I'm not a part of a product of that."
Only King can speak to his family history or what forces in his background may have conspired to make the Fourth District congressman so misogynistic and prejudiced. But with those glib dismissals of violent, traumatic criminal acts, he sends a message to rape survivors, would-be rapists and family members who would sexually abuse a female relative. He tells them it's OK, if it results in pregnancy and childbirth.
King made the comments to justify his support for anti-abortion legislation that would make no exceptions for rape or incest. He was denounced for the remarks by several congressional Republicans along with two of his primary challengers and the Iowa GOP spokesman. Predictably, Republican U.S. Sens. Charles Grassley and Joni Ernst didn't go that far, though both said rape and incest are never justified.
A Republican National Committee official I contacted in Washington, D.C., who asked not to be identified by name, said in an e-mail, "His comments were appalling and wrong. Steve King continues to demonstrate why House Republican leadership was right to remove him from his committee assignments." That happened earlier this year after the New York Times reported King had questioned what was so offensive about the terms white supremacist or white nationalist.
But King has built his career on saying offensive things, whether about gays, nonwhites, Latinos or non-Western civilizations. He has asked how Western societies can perpetuate their European heritage by raising "other people's" babies. He has compared immigrants to hunting dogs.
Democratic presidential candidate and others are now mounting calls for King to resign. But if the past is precedent, such calls just embolden him and fuel King's fundraising efforts, which depict him as a target for being a conservative Donald Trump supporter.
On Jan. 16, after The New York Times reported on his remarks about white supremacy and he was dislodged from House committees, King sent out a fundraising email saying, "the unhinged Left has teamed up with Republican 'NeverTrumpers' and is pulling out all the stops to destroy me. Since they were unable to defeat my campaign in the 2018 Midterm Elections, the rabid Leftist media is currently blasting the airwaves in a pathetic attempt to paint me as a 'racist.'"
An email on Jan. 25 said, "The blatantly biased liberal/fake-news media complex is out of control ... After leveraging their lies to get me stripped of my committee assignments and formally reprimanded — the media is once again at my throat with breaking news about not one but THREE primary challengers!"
Evidently the media showed its vendetta just by reporting King was being challenged.
In a March 9 email, King called out "Swamp-dwelling D.C. lobbyists" for holding a fundraiser for one of his primary challengers. He also slammed "identity politics-kowtowing Republicans in the House" for "joining Democrats to attack me in Congress."
And on March 14, King wrote: "Republican leadership in Congress caved after the fake news New York Times twisted my words and tried to assassinate my character."
So no, King is not going to heed Democrats' calls to resign.
But then what? The House of Representatives could expel him with a two-thirds vote if a House Committee investigation showed King to have violated a congressional standard of conduct. The House's official code of conduct requires members to act in a way that reflects "creditably" on the institution.
It's also possible to impeach a member of Congress. But the easiest way to stop the national nightmare that King has become is for voters in his district to vote him out next year. This time, they have solid Republican and Democratic alternatives.
King repeatedly shows what he's made of. Now it's on the people of the Fourth District to show what they're made of.

Texto completo: Begun by alums of St. Olaf College who missed playing music in a large ensemble – a really good large ensemble – the Metropolitan Symphony Orchestra is now in its 38th year. They perform in various locations in and around the Twin Cities, and all of their concerts are free.
The MSO is an amateur orchestra with a stellar reputation and an adventuresome spirit. Over the years, it has taken on several works by the late Dominic Argento, including the world premiere of his “Ode to the West Wind.” Argento, who was appointed the MSO’s Composer Laureate in 2016, gave them the nickname “One Damned Fine Symphony Orchestra.”
Their 2019-20 season, announced Thursday, includes a work by Argento. Each concert will feature a piece by a living composer. There will be four premieres (two are MSO commissions) and three works by women (two are premieres). All concerts will be led by William Schrickel, the MSO’s music director since 2000.
Oct. 13: Kevin Kling Channels the Brothers Grimm. “The Twelve Dancing Princesses,” the world premiere of an MSO commission by Victor Zupanc and Kevin Kling, narrated by Kling, will be paired with Shostakovich’s First Violin Concerto.
Nov. 24: Music for the Opera, Ballet, Theater & Concert Hall. The world premiere of the large orchestra version of John Orfe’s “Oyster,” plus Argento’s witty ballet score, “Royal Invitation – Homage to the Queen of Tonga” and two suites by Bizet, “Carmen” No. 1 and “L’Arlesienne” No. 2.
Feb. 8 and 16, 2020: The Composer Is Dead! A murder mystery that cleverly (and hilariously) introduces the audience to the instruments of the orchestra, Nathaniel Stookey’s composition, with text by Lemony Snicket, will be narrated by musician, actor, composer and friend to the MSO Jake Endres. The concert will end with John Williams’ “Star Wars” suite, with music from the final scene of the first film.
March 29: Nazaykinskaya Premiere, Mahler 5 . The world premiere of the large orchestra version of Russian composer Polina Nazaykinskaya’s “Fenix” and the massive Mahler 5, together on one mighty program. This will be the fifth Nazayinskaya composition to be performed by the MSO.
May 10: Shakespeare & Chaminade. The world premiere of the MSO-commissioned “Will’s Ladies,” a set of soliloquies by five of Shakespeare’s women (Portia, Juliet, Ophelia, Lady Macbeth and Cleopatra) set to music by Carol Barnett, with soliloquist Christina Baldwin and mezzo-soprano Clara Osowski. The program will also include French composer Cécile Chaminade’s rarely performed Concertstück for Piano and Orchestra and Tchaikovsky’s “Romeo and Juliet.”
Tickets will go on sale never, but donations are requested. FMI.
The picks
Tonight (Friday, Aug. 16) at the Ordway: Los Lobos. The three-time Grammy winners and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame nominees are touring behind their 24th album, “Gates of Gold,” which (to quote NPR) “practically bursts with the spirit of exploration that has marked Los Lobos’ best work over the years. Musically and culturally, the band speaks to its audience in a way few others have or could.” Most of the band members are children of Mexican immigrants. 7:30 p.m. FMI and tickets ($48-79).
On sale today: Gregory Porter at the Fitzgerald. A superstar vocalist with a gorgeous baritone, the big man has a big gift: He can sing to a crowd of thousands and make you believe you’re the only one. A two-time Grammy winner (for “Liquid Spirit” and “Take Me to the Alley”), Porter draws on jazz, soul and gospel to sing about love, relationships, and life. FMI and tickets ($49.50-79.50).
Opens tonight at the Lagoon: “Cold Case Hammarskjöld.” Danish documentarian Mads Brügger won the World Cinema Documentary Directing Award at Sundance for his unconventional investigation into the still-unsolved mystery of Dag Hammarskjöld’s death. The U.N. secretary general’s plane went down in 1961 in what was then Northern Rhodesia; all 16 people on board were killed. More than 50 years later, Denmark’s Michael Moore and Swedish researcher Göran Björkdahl went looking for answers. The New York Times called it “an excavation of international intrigue”; the Wall Street Journal said “gonzo.” FMI including trailer, times and tickets.
Saturday in Mears Park: St. Paul Food Truck Festival. Go for brunch, stay for lunch, dinner, and a late-night snack. With more than 40 food trucks, live music, craft beers, lawn games, and giveaways, this can easily be an all-day affair. (The music schedule: Jacuzzi Puma from noon-3 p.m., Riverside Hitmen from 3:30-6:30, Alex Rossi from 7-10). Proceeds from wristband sales benefit Feed My Starving Children. 12 noon-10 p.m. FMI. Free.
Monday at the Southern: “Good Night at the Southern.” Pay what you can for an evening of local artists sharing new ideas, works in progress and previews of upcoming performances. The latest installment of the monthly series will feature Queen Drea, Jennifer Mack, Brenna Moser Dance Works and Eric Larson/Toot. Just saying we’ve seen Queen Drea a couple of times now – once with Black Label Movement and once at the Cedar, hosting a Sun Ra night – and she’s pretty great. Doors and bar open at 6:30 p.m., show at 7:30. FMI and tickets.

What the Gannett-GateHouse merger means for Minnesota

Texto completo: Gannett Co. Inc. and GateHouse Media — two of the biggest newspaper chains in the U.S. — recently announced plans to merge.
Under the terms of the agreement, GateHouse owner New Media Investment Group plans to acquire Gannett, publisher of USA Today and several smaller papers across the country. The new company would retain the Gannett name.
Both Gannett and GateHouse have a presence in Minnesota, though GateHouse’s market share here is considerably larger. GateHouse publishes eight papers in the state, most of them weekly, while Gannett’s sole presence in Minnesota is the daily St. Cloud Times .
Still, Fargo-based Forum Communications Co. dwarfs both companies’ operations in Minnesota: Forum publishes around 20 newspapers in the state, according to its website. As a result, impacts of the GateHouse-Gannett merger may be limited in Minnesota.
Number of Minnesota papers
GateHouse 8
Gannett 1
Forum 20
“Compared to other parts of the country, GateHouse and Gannett don’t have a huge presence in Minnesota,” says Mark Neuzil, chair of the journalism program at the University of St. Thomas.
In a news release, GateHouse and Gannett say they’ll continue to “invest in newsrooms” even as they eye cost-cutting measures in the range of about $275 million to $300 million each year.
Neuzil says he’s not sure how the two will pull off those savings. And like many other industry observers, he’s concerned about the possibility of more newsroom cuts or slashes to newspaper frequency.
Today, GateHouse publishes just one daily paper in Minnesota: Minneapolis-based Finance & Commerce . (The Crookston Times , also published by GateHouse, switched from daily to twice weekly back in May.)
Neuzil says the companies’ daily papers in Minnesota will likely “feel the pinch” of the merger before the weeklies.
“My advice to them would be to not speed up the death spiral. Cost-cutting turns off readers and discourages advertisers,” Neuzil says.
It’s no secret that the newspaper business has been struggling over the last decade. According to the Poynter Institute, the number of newsroom employees dropped from 71,000 in 2008 to around 39,000 in 2017. The number of newspapers has been on the decline, too. Since 2004, it’s estimated that more than 2,000 newspapers have ceased production.
Minnesota papers haven’t been spared from the industry’s upheaval. A few months ago, for instance, the Warroad Pioneer published its last edition, attracting national media attention.
Meanwhile, the Star Tribune remains the dominant daily paper in the state. In 2016, the newspaper reported a total Sunday circulation of more than 581,000. The Strib also counts more than 1.2 million weekly readers in the Twin Cities metro area.
The Strib , which seems to have weathered the newspaper industry’s seismic changes better than many other publications, likely benefits from having Glen Taylor as its private owner, says Neuzil. Unlike papers owned by publicly traded companies, the Strib isn’t beholden to shareholders’ demands.
“It’s important to have local ownership, and that’s incredibly rare these days,” Neuzil says.
Gayle Golden, senior lecturer at the University of Minnesota’s Hubbard School of Journalism and Mass Communication, notes that private owners may be more willing to hold onto their newspapers “even if revenues dip.”
And, like The New York Times and The Washington Post , the Strib benefits from having a strong established brand.
“It’s able to leverage the brand successfully, not only by selling newspapers and attracting readers to its website, but by doing other ancillary things that take advantage of the brand,” Neuzil says, citing the paper’s sponsorship of local events as an example. “They’re diversifying without really saying they’re diversifying.”
But small papers likely don’t have the same brand recognition, which means they might not be able to attract national advertisers and subscribers.
Golden says she’s frank with students interested in pursuing journalism, though she won’t discourage anyone.
“I talk to them truthfully about the state of the industry,” she says. “Many of them find jobs, but then find it more challenging as they go forward to build their careers.”
She emphasizes that there are other avenues for journalism, too.
“There are many opportunities, and it doesn’t just take place on one platform,” Golden says. “Newspapers aren’t the only place where journalism occurs.”
The GateHouse-Gannett merger still needs to obtain federal approval. In a blog post, news industry analyst Ken Doctor says it’s unlikely the Department of Justice would halt the deal, valued at about $1.4 billion.

Texto completo: The Aug. 3 shooting rampage in El Paso, Texas, took the lives of 22 people and seriously injured more than two dozen others. Reportedly, the alleged shooter wanted to kill as many Mexicans as he could. Armed with safety glasses, ear coverings and an assault-style rifle, the shooter entered a Walmart store during a back-to-school sale.
"Saturdays attack on El Paso was an attack on the Mexican heritage of millions of Americans - and also part of a history of white supremacist and nativist acts in Texas across three centuries," wrote HectorTobarin arecent New York Times op-ed. Tobar, an associate professor at the University of California at Irvine, is also a published author.
Later that day during evening hours and nearly 1,600 miles away in Dayton, Ohio, another gunman's attack left nine people dead and 27 injured in that city's Oregon district Like the Texas shooter, Ohio's shooter was heavily armed but was shot by police before he could enter a nightclub where he could have killed far more. The victims of this shooting reflected the city's diversity and included Blacks, Latinos and whites.
How in a span of only 24 hours, could two cities in different states and regions suffer mass shootings - one in a city only a few miles from the nation's southern border, and the other, a former Midwestern manufacturing hub?
Despite the shock of two unprovoked attacks, family and community members in both cities must somehow cope through their grief while preparing funeral arrangements. These two communities are also challenging governmental officials at both the state and federal levels to take actions to prevent further fatalities.
Nationally, a profusion of prayers and condolences from the nation together signaled that a tragic moment may yet be transformed into a groundswell movement that reckons with the American conscience. The profusion of assault weapons combined with easy access is a gripping issue that confronts us all.
In response to these and other tragedies, a diverse coalition of leaders held a rally Tuesday in the nation's capital. In a joint statement, the Leadership Conference for Civil and Human Rights was joined by key partners including but not limited to the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, Voto Latino, the Center for Community Self-Help and the Center for Responsible Lending.
"None of this is acceptable," said the leaders in a written statement. "None of this is normal. Our organizations are united in saying that Members of Congress can no longer look away as communities of color are murdered with impunity. We must all unite and demand accountability."
The NAACP and the National Urban League additionally called for the passage of the bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019. Passed on a bipartisan House vote of 240-190 on Feb. 27, the bill has yet to be taken up by the Senate. It would address both background check requirements for firearms and firearm transfers between private individuals.
Beyond congressional actions, however, other spheres of influence can also take an active role in curbing violence. For example, corporate leaders could publicly condemn efforts to demonize immigrants, people of color or other groups targeted for hate crimes and violence. In pulpits across the country, pastors should preach about the moral dilemma the nation faces and call upon congregants to live their faith every day. Community-based organizations can call upon state and local officials to also speak out against senseless acts of violence and white supremacists.
Now is also a time to remember that regardless of race or ethnicity, our history chronicles the range of hate crimes that have taken the lives of Latinos as well as Native Americans, Blacks, Jews and the LGBTQ community. The tenor now facing America's Latinos resurrects these horrors, particularly how Blacks encountered racial hatred for more than a century during Jim Crow era and later during the civil rights struggles of the 1950s and 1960s.
Too many times in recent years, our unique Black American experience we remain at risk as a people. In 1998, the body of James Byrd, a 49-year-old Black man from Jasper, Texas, was ripped to pieces as it was dragged over a mile and a half by whites driving a pickup truck Other and more recent heinous hate crimes remind us of Trayvon Martin, Mchael Brown, Eric Garner and Tamir Rice, just to name a few.
According to Rutgers University, Black men today are 2.5 times more likely than white men to be victims of violence. From 2013 to 2017,11,456 fatal encounters with police and members of the public were reported.
At the same time, the emergence of hate groups has been on the rise, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC).
"The total number of hate groups rose to 1,020 in 2018, up about 7 percent from 2017," wrote Heidi Beirich, who leads SPLCs Intelligence Project and its award-winning publication The Intelligence Report.
Its report released this February found that white nationalist groups grew from 100 in 2017 to 148 the following year, 2018 - a 50% growth. Other hate groups - anti-Semitic, anti-LGBTQ and anti-Muslim - also grew during these same years from 233 to 264. While the Ku Klux Klan dominated hate groups in the Jim Crow and civil rights eras, its presence across the country now appears to have been eclipsed by the growth of neo-Nazis, white nationalists and skinhead organizations.
SPLCs Hate Map by State shows that the largest number of statewide hate groups are located in California (83), Florida (75) and Texas (73). At the local level, additional hate organizations currently operate in Dallas, Los Angeles, San Diego and Tallahassee. Beyond these three states, hate groups can also be found in 45 other states and in more metropolitan areas such as Atlanta, Chicago, New %rk City, Sacramento, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.
Just as the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. prompted the enactment of major civil rights legislation, now is another time for our nation to stand up to the many forms of domestic terrorism that plagues it. People of conscience and principle have a duty to stand up, speak out for the fullness of our "inalienable rights."

According to the complaint, California tracks have an agreement with the state thoroughbred trainers group not to discriminate against a trainer "by way of arbitrary or capricious conduct by the track." [...]seeded Naomi Osaka and fourth-seeded Simona Halep had to work harder to advance, both surviving three-set duels.

Texto completo: Hall of Fame trainer Jerry Hollendorfer is asking an Alameda County Superior Court judge to lift a ban stopping him from stabling or racing horses at Golden Gate Fields in Albany, according to a legal complaint.
Hollendorfer requested emergency relief with a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction against the Pacific Racing Association so he can work the fall season that begins today and runs through Sept. 29.
The California Thoroughbred Trainers joined Hollendorfer in the complaint against the association, which is licensed to operate racing at Golden Gate Fields for the Stronach Group, the companty that owns the East Bay track and Santa Anita Park near Los Angeles.
Stronach banned Hollendorfer, 73, on June 22 from their California tracks after the fourth thoroughbred under his care died during the winter season at Santa Anita. Hollendorfer told this news organization that he was never given a reason for the ban. The action came as the racing industry faced increasing pressure to dramatically change the sport in the wake of news of scores of horses dying during races and training.
Hollendorfer's lawyer, Drew Couto, said Wednesday that Pacific Racing Association officials need to give the trainer a fair hearing process before they can ban him from the track. According to the complaint, California tracks have an agreement with the state thoroughbred trainers group not to discriminate against a trainer "by way of arbitrary or capricious conduct by the track."
A hearing is scheduled on Friday before Alameda Superior Court Judge Noel Wise.
David Duggan, general manager and vice president of Golden Gate Fields, declined to comment Wednesday.
Hollendorfer could not be immediately reached for comment.
The complaint, filed Monday, said the California Thoroughbred Trainers recently asked the California Horse Racing Board, the state commission that governs the industry, to intervene in the dispute between Hollendorfer and track owners. An investigation into the matter has not been completed, the complaint said.
Couto used a similar legal tactic to win a temporary restraining order July 26 that has allowed Hollendorfer to return to the stables at the Del Mar Racetrack after an initial ban. In the ruling, a San Diego judge said: "Mr. Hollendorfer will suffer irreparable harm if an injunction is not issued."
Hollendorfer began his career in the Bay Area four decades ago. He ranks third of all-time among trainers, with 7,628 wins. He was inducted into the Racing Hall of Fame in 2011.
Soccer
U.S. women ready to plead their case in court >> The players of the world champion U.S. women's national soccer team are ready to take their pay dispute to court after mediation with the U.S. Soccer Federation broke down Wednesday.
Maintaining that they are paid less than their counterparts on the U.S. men's national team, the USWNT players will proceed with the lawsuit they filed before successfully defending their Women's World Cup title in France this summer.
The players' spokesperson, Molly Levinson, said in the statement, "We entered this week's mediation with representatives of USSF full of hope. Today we must conclude these meetings sorely disappointed in the Federation's determination to perpetuate fundamentally discriminatory workplace conditions and behavior. ... We want all of our fans, sponsors, peers around the world, and women everywhere to know we are undaunted and will eagerly look forward to a jury trial."
The USSF issued its own statement, saying, "... during mediation we had hoped we would be able to address the issues in a respectful manner and reach an agreement. Unfortunately, instead of allowing mediation to proceed in a considerate manner, plaintiffs' counsel took an aggressive and ultimately unproductive approach that follows months of presenting misleading information to the public in an effort to perpetuate confusion. ... Despite inflammatory statements from their spokesperson, which are intended to paint our actions inaccurately and unfairly, we are undaunted in our efforts to continue discussions in good faith."
Last month, the USSF publicly announced it paid more to the women's players than to the men's players from 2010-18. However, the USWNT dismissed the figures as being inaccurate, and the U.S. men's national team players issued a statement also disputing the federation's numbers.
Tennis
Top seeds advance at Western & Southern >> After a slow start, top-seeded Ashleigh Barty made quick work of Maria Sharapova, winning 6-4, 6-1 in 89 minutes to reach the round of 16 at the Western & Southern Open near Cincinnati. Second-seeded Naomi Osaka and fourth-seeded Simona Halep had to work harder to advance, both surviving three-set duels. Third-seeded Karolina Pliskova advanced in two.
Basketball
Lue linked to Clippers >> The Los Angeles Clippers are close to hiring Tyronn Lue, the former Cleveland Cavaliers head coach, as a top assistant to coach Doc Rivers, according to multiple reports. In May, Lue was widely billed as the leading candidate to take over as head coach of the LeBron James-led Los Angeles Lakers before talks abruptly collapsed over contract terms.
Nets deal nears >> Joseph Tsai, a co-founder of Alibaba, the Chinese internet giant, is closing in on a record-breaking deal to gain sole ownership of the Brooklyn Nets. The deal, valuing the team at $2.35 billion, will set a record for the purchase price of a sports franchise.

Texto completo: Fox News anchor Sandra Smith pushed back against the vice president of the National Border Patrol Council during an interview after he described a recent incident at a Colorado ICE facility as an "invasion."
Appearing Thursday on America’s Newsroom to discuss recent attacks on ICE buildings across the country, Art Del Cueto said, "Disgusting. It’s disgusting to see something like that."
"I think it’s been triggered by way too many individuals that have had a platform to speak against the men and women that are trying to defend our nation’s borders, the law enforcement communities," he went on to explain. "That is where it comes from. There was a recent article that attacks various reporters from Fox, attacked Fox News, it named me on there as well, saying that we were responsible for some of these attacks that happened in El Paso."
Del Cueto was referencing a recent New York Times article that pointed out the similarities between the manifesto left behind by the man who killed more than 20 people in El Paso, Texas earlier this month, and the rhetoric of many Fox News personalities.
Fox News anchor stops Border Patrol Council VP after he used the word 'invasion'
"That was based on us talking about actual facts. And the facts we spoke about are simple. When you have individuals in large quantities that enter another country by force or illegally, waving the flag of another country, that is an invasion. I stand by those words," Del Cueto continued.
He was referencing an incident that occurred outside of an ICE facility in Colorado last month. Protesters took down the American flag and replaced it with a Mexican flag and also raised up a vandalized Blue Lives Matter flag, which had "Abolish I.C.E." spray-painted over it.
"Hold on," Smith interrupted, and then they proceeded to talk over one another.
She added, "Obviously, we have to push back on comments like that. People will take issues with you calling at that. It is obviously a sensitive issue right now."
Smith then directed the conversation back to the specific attacks against ICE facilities.

Jeffrey Epstein accuser sues companion Ghislaine Maxwell as alleged enabler

Texto completo: Under New York's new Child Victims Act, a Jeffrey Epstein accuser is suing his estate, a longtime female associate and three unnamed members of his household staff for allegedly aiding Epstein in a sexual abuse and trafficking scheme, according to reports.
Jennifer Araoz, 32, says Epstein, who died of an apparent suicide last week while in jail awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges, raped her at his mansion in Manhattan when she was 15.
She explained her decision to file the lawsuit in an article that appeared Wednesday on the opinion page of The New York Times.
"I used to feel alone, walking into his mansion with the cameras pointing at me, but now I have the power of the law on my side," she wrote. "I will be seen. I will be heard. I will demand justice. "
Araoz said she had felt that "the power structure was stacked against me" and that Epstein's money, influence and connection made her want to hide and stay silent.
"Reliving these experiences is tough, but I’ve learned to be tougher," she wrote.
In July, she said in a "Today" show interview with Savannah Guthrie of NBC News that she planned to sue Epstein. She said at the time that she was recruited outside her high school near Epstein's home.
“I was just a lost kid, you know,“ Araoz told Guthrie.
Araoz alleged in her complaint in New York that socialite and longtime Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell and the other staffers “conspired with each other to make possible and otherwise facilitate the sexual abuse and rape of Plaintiff,” NBC News reports.
The suit alleges that Maxwell “participated with and assisted Epstein in maintaining and protecting Defendant Epstein’s sex trafficking ring” by ensuring a steady stream of young women by identifying and hiring “recruiters,” setting up appointments with Epstein, as well as intimidating potential witnesses, according to NBC News.
The other unnamed targets of the suit are identified only as “the Recruiter,” the “Secretary” and the “Maid,” according to The Daily Beast.
Maxwell, daughter of British media magnate Robert Maxwell, has not been criminally charged and has repeatedly denied accusations that she assisted Epstein in his sexual abuse and alleged trafficking of underage girls.
Maxwell, 57, had been a longtime companion of Epstein and is shown embracing the disgraced financier in a photo next to Donald Trump and then-girlfriend Melania Knauss at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in 2000.
Maxwell's ties to Epstein resurfaced last week when a federal judge unsealed documents in a 2015 defamation suit against Maxwell brought by alleged Epstein victim Virginia Roberts Giuffre. Although the case was settled in 2017, the depositions, phone logs and other documents portray Maxwell as an alleged enabler for Epstein's sexual abuse.
The Araoz lawsuit was filed under New York's new Child Victims Act, which took effect Wednesday. The act gives alleged victims of child sex abuse the right to bring civil cases against alleged abusers for the next 12 months, regardless of when the abuse occurred. After that period, victims will still have until age 55 to file civil suits.
The new act also increases from 23 to 28 the age when an alleged victim of felony sexual abuse can press charges and from 23 to 25 in misdemeanor cases.
On the criminal front, federal prosecutors have vowed to continue pursuing the trafficking case despite Epstein's death. They say they will now focus on anyone who assisted or enabled Epstein in what authorities say was his widespread sexual abuse.

Texto completo: As a physician who has worked with prisoners as well as suicidal patients, I was shocked by the strange circumstances surrounding sexual offender Jeffrey Epstein’s death by apparent hanging in his cell. We may never know for sure all the details of what happened, though I expect further review of the autopsy results to determine once and for all whether this death was self-inflicted.
Earlier in my career, I worked on both a psychiatric ward and a prison ward. In both places, the regular surveillance was sufficient (at least every 15 minutes on the psych ward) so that suicide was almost impossible. For someone who, like Epstein, had apparently made a suicide attempt less than three weeks before, it is almost inconceivable to me that he could possibly be without diligent, frequent observation and without surveillance cameras constantly monitoring him.
How could he be placed in a cell, according to the New York Post's unnamed source, with a bunk bed to hang himself on and a strong enough bed sheet to do it with? If one cellmate was transferred, as sources told The New York Times, why wasn’t he immediately replaced with another?
'Serious irregularities' raise eyebrows
It's true that suicide is the leading cause of death in jails and, in 2014, hit a 15-year high in federal and state prisons, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. But although accused sexual offenders are particularly at risk for both suicides and homicides, the Metropolitan Correctional Center where Epstein was imprisoned has had only one reported suicide over the past 40 years, the gangster Louis Turra, 21 years ago.
Money talks: Harvard drops #MeToo image when donations are at risk
Despite its reputation for squalor and overcrowding, the corrections center is not known for suicide.
What is most disturbing to me, as a physician, is the way Epstein went from being on suicide watch starting July 23 to going for long periods without being observed just six days later, sources told The Times. Having treated depression for many years, I know suicidal ideation doesn’t turn on and off like a switch. A person does not want to end it all one day — staring down news as bleak as Epstein faced — and then six days later you are suddenly stable and out of danger. Whoever took Epstein off this watch made a very poor judgement at the very least. And the latest reports by sources of The Times that guards fell asleep for possibly hours while on watch and then falsified records is simply inexcusable.
I am not a conspiracy theorist, though it is conceivable to me that the “serious irregularities” Attorney General William Barr is concerned about could possibly turn out to reveal that Epstein’s was not a simple suicide, that there were other actors in this tragedy. Time, along with the final autopsy report, will tell. It is clear that there were many victims in Epstein's life who loathed him for legitimate reasons, and many others who stood to lose more by his survival than by his death.
Doctors try to save everyone
But no matter what happened inside Epstein’s cell, both the medical personnel and the prison authorities who were involved had the obligation to bring him to a safer place, whether that meant more enhanced psychiatric observation inside the prison, or transferring him with enhanced security to an inpatient psychiatric facility. There was plenty of warning that this could happen.
Children deserve more than we give them: I lost a student to sex trafficking and murder. We woefully fail to protect our children.
After all, we don’t judge our patients, no matter how repulsive their actions or the allegations against them are. Doctors and nurses are simply assigned to try to keep them alive. I have taken care of a perpetrator of assault chained to a stretcher in the emergency room right next to his victim suffering from a gunshot wound, and I have had to do my best to save both without hesitation.
The prison officials who took Jeffrey Epstein off his suicide watch prematurely, relegating him to almost certain death, did not do the prison system and how it handles mental health emergencies any favors.

Texto completo: Lake County State’s Attorney Mike Nerheim announced a lawsuit Tuesday against e-cigarette manufacturer Juul Labs, contending the company "intentionally created addicted teen customers to continuously come back looking for another fix." The merits of the specific case against Juul will be sorted out in court, but there is a broader reach to the alarm bells that Nerheim is sounding. In short, teen vaping is here, it’s dangerous and it poses the threat of a broad epidemic.
Illinois lawmakers recognized that truth when they included e-cigarettes in a new law that prohibits the sale of tobacco and tobacco-related products to anyone under 21 years old. Juul, it is worth pointing out, has launched major ad campaigns with some of the nation’s largest print and online news organizations declaring its support for such restrictions on the sale of vapor products.
The sincerity of Juul’s appeal may be open to question, but there’s no room for doubt that it and Illinois’ new regulations are running several steps behind the e-cigarette monster that is rampaging through suburban middle and high schools.
At a news conference announcing the lawsuit, Stevenson High School senior Vrushali Thakkar described classrooms in which students use e-cigarettes when teachers leave the room. A New York Times story this week reports the son of an anti-e-cigarette activist describing the flavors he and his friends prefer and the appeal to some kids of products whose higher nicotine content provide "a bigger head rush."
But, evidence isn’t merely anecdotal. The National Institute on Drug Abuse cites studies showing that more than 16% of high school seniors — and nearly 10% of eighth-graders have used e-cigarettes in the past month. Another National Institutes of Health survey found that about 37% of high school seniors reported vaping in 2018. The figure was 28% a year earlier.
While vape companies like to declare that their product is intended only to help people stop smoking, they may be working toward the precise opposite. The NIH report points to studies showing that nearly 31 percent of students who vape graduate to traditional cigarettes and tobacco products within six months.
According to The New York Times, Trump administration health officials recognize the problem and are considering counter measures. The outgoing FDA commissioner proposed isolating e-cigarette products at retailers where they won’t be accessible to teenagers and requiring merchants to demand purchasers show identification.
If adopted, such measures may be a start. But the situation also requires a broader societal response. Nerheim predicted Tuesday that "it will take years" to overcome the impact e-cigarettes have made on the present generation of teenagers. That is not going to happen merely by punishing companies that have made impressionable children think it’s harmless and cool to use their dangerous product. It also requires broad recognition by all of us of the need to make them realize that neither of those things is true.

Texto completo: With the deadline to qualify for the next Democratic presidential debates looming just two weeks away, candidates on the bubble are mounting some of their final offensives, urgently seeking supporters who can help them make the cut.
Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York has poured more than $ 1 million into advertising in Iowa and New Hampshire. Julián Castro, the former housing secretary, bought a local ad in Bedminster, N.J., where President Trump is vacationing this week. And Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii has urged her supporters to try to improve their chances of being selected for online polls.
They and other lower-tier candidates are desperately searching for voters who can propel them to 2 percent support in qualifying polls, one of the Democratic National Committee's requirements for the next set of debates, scheduled for Sept. 12 and 13 in Houston. The threshold for the June and July debates was merely 1 percent.
[ Andrew Yang became the ninth Democrat to qualify for the September debates. ]
Meanwhile, Tom Steyer, the former hedge fund investor turned impeachment activist, has spent millions of dollars flooding the internet with ads that have helped him catch up to his rivals after entering the race in July. On Tuesday his campaign announced that he had crossed the other threshold for qualification by collecting donations from more than 130,000 people.
The collective scramble to earn a spot on the stage next month underscores the importance the campaigns are placing on the next debates. Those who secure a lectern will have another opportunity to speak to a national audience, but those who miss out will face louder calls to withdraw as Democrats grow anxious for the field to narrow.
"This is the brave new world of D.N.C. debate qualification standards," said Jim Hobart, a partner at Public Opinion Strategies, a Republican polling firm. "Democratic presidential candidates are clearly going to do whatever they can to qualify for these debates, whether that's spending millions of dollars on television ads or encouraging donors to sign up for these online polls."
A New York Times analysis of polling and donation data shows that nine of the 24 Democratic candidates have already qualified for the next debates by collecting donations from at least 130,000 people and reaching 2 percent support in four qualifying polls. The deadline to meet those standards is Aug. 28.
Mr. Castro, Ms. Gabbard, Ms. Gillibrand and Mr. Steyer are all within striking distance. Mr. Castro and Mr. Steyer need only one more qualifying poll; Ms. Gabbard needs three more; and Ms. Gillibrand needs about 30,000 more donors as well as three more qualifying polls.
None of the other candidates except former Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado have hit 2 percent in any qualifying polls, and Mr. Hickenlooper had only about 14,000 individual donors as of June 30. The Times reported this week that he was considering dropping out of the race.
[ These three cities are key for 2020 Democrats . They're not in Iowa or New Hampshire.]
The campaigns are not necessarily seeing a return on their investment as they hunt for new donors; many are asking for $ 1 contributions. But the size of the donations does not matter for debate qualification, only the number of individual contributors. That has skewed campaigns' strategies and encouraged them to create advertising they hope will go viral.
Mr. Castro's new advertisement is set to appear Wednesday on Fox News in Bedminster, where Mr. Trump is staying at his golf course. In the ad, Mr. Castro speaks directly to the president, ticking off Mr. Trump's words and actions that he says "stoked the fire of racists" and inspired the mass shooting that killed 22 people in El Paso this month.
"Innocent people were shot down because they look different from you. Because they look like me. They look like my family," Mr. Castro says in the ad. "Words have consequences."
Mr. Castro's campaign said it spent $ 2,775 to run the ad a few times on Wednesday. His team said the ad was meant to send a message to Mr. Trump, who watches Fox News regularly, but campaign officials also expected it would resonate with voters.
Ms. Gillibrand's new 30-second ad, titled "Imagine," paints her as "a leader driven by compassion, brave enough to take on the impossible, who looks beyond herself to do what's best for us." Her campaign said the ad spending was intended in part to "bolster the campaign's efforts to qualify for the fall debates."
Ms. Gillibrand's campaign had more than $ 8 million on hand at the end of June, and her aides have said that the 24 hours after the July debate were her strongest of the campaign in terms of bringing in new online donors and contributions.
She has spent heavily since then. Over the past month, her campaign spent $ 1 million on Facebook ads, according to data from the company, second only to Mr. Steyer's campaign during that period.
Mr. Steyer's team has said he plans to spend at least $ 100 million on the race. His campaign has already spent about $ 3 million advertising on Facebook and $ 820,000 on Google, according to data from those companies.
In the seven-day period ending on Sunday, he spent $ 1.1 million on Facebook, roughly five times as much as the second highest-spending Democratic candidate in that period, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. On Sunday alone, Mr. Steyer spent about $ 140,000 on Facebook -- more than what many candidates, including Senator Kamala Harris of California and former Representative Beto O'Rourke of Texas, spent on the platform in the past month.
Mr. Steyer has also spent about $ 6.5 million on television advertising since he hit the trail, according to Medium Buying, a Republican media buying agency.
A spokesman for Mr. Steyer's campaign declined to comment on its spending and the amount of money it had raised in contributions. But other campaigns took note that Mr. Steyer had reached the donor threshold so quickly.
"The D.N.C. donor requirement may have been added with the right intentions, but there's no doubt that it's created a situation in which billionaires can buy their way onto the debate stage," Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana said in a statement on Tuesday. "We're kidding ourselves if we're calling a $ 10 million purchase of 130,000 donors a demonstration of grass-roots support."
Ms. Gabbard -- who left the campaign trail this week to report for a two-week training exercise with the National Guard -- is in need of better polling results. In an effort to improve those prospects, her team sent an email to supporters this month imploring them to "take the time to answer if you receive a call from a pollster or are presented with an online poll."
The email also listed "ways you can increase your chances of being selected for a debate-qualifying poll." It encouraged supporters to fill out surveys from the online polling firms Survey Monkey and YouGov in an effort to be selected for their presidential primary polls.
Doug Rivers, YouGov's chief scientist, said in an email that he and his team were aware of messages like the one sent by the Gabbard campaign. But he said the company's systems made it extremely unlikely that a newly registered respondent would be surveyed in a qualifying poll. Even then, he said, there would be too few new panelists to skew the results.
A spokeswoman for Survey Monkey said it randomly selects its respondents and prevents those selected from responding multiple times.
Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Trump's value-free approach to China

Texto completo: A concern for human rights and democracy has often been seen as an add-on to our country's foreign policy, an attractive veneer over the usual realpolitik. But President Trump is demonstrating that a supposedly "America First" policy focused entirely on trade and divorced from a commitment to our values is incoherent.
Trump is embarrassing our country - and weakening it, too - by refusing to stand with the people of Hong Kong as they struggle against China's dictatorship.
We have long wondered when the thoughtless chaos of Trump's presidency would finally catch up with him and endanger our country. How long could an administration that replaces policy with impulse and thinking with tweeting stay out of crisis? The disarray around Trump's China policy and the economic turmoil it has unleashed tell us that moment is now.
Somehow, Trump seemed to think he could be tough on China and still express his admiration for President Xi Jinping's brutally authoritarian rule.
"He's now president for life. President for life. No, he's great," Trump told Republican donors at a fundraising event at his Mar-a-Lago estate in early 2018. "And look, he was able to do that. I think it's great. Maybe we'll give that a shot some day."
So it should not surprise us that as Xi tries to put down pro-democracy forces in Hong Kong, Trump was ready to employ "the language used by Communist Party officials," as the New York Times put it, in saying on Aug. 1 that Hong Kong has had "riots for a long period of time."
"Somebody said that at some point they're going to want to stop that," Trump added. "But that's between Hong Kong and that's between China, because Hong Kong is a part of China." Translation: Do what you have to do, China.
Trump underscored his indifference to democracy Tuesday on Twitter. Responding to Chinese troops gathering at the Hong Kong border, he said only: "Everyone should be calm and safe!"
This reaction is scandalous from the leader of a nation whose Constitution begins with the words: "We the People."
When it came to trade negotiations, Trump blustered about imposing new tariffs on Chinese goods, sent the stock market into a tailspin and then backed off from many of the tariffs, "just in case they might have an impact on people."
We count on presidents to consider "just in case" issues before they act. With Trump, it's all a thoughtless, strategy-less blur. Say anything, see how it goes, then say something else.
He charmingly expressed concern about the effect of the tariffs on "the Christmas shopping season," thus effectively contradicting his own false claims that the Chinese, not Americans, would pay the tariffs.
But Trump's correction-on-the-fly may not be able to undo the damage he (and Xi) have done to the world economy. The stock market's dive on Wednesday reflected recession fears gripping investors. Unsurprisingly, Trump's about-face seemed motivated not by any grand strategy but by a purely selfish concern for his own reelection. "Nobody wants to run for president, on either party, in the middle of a recession," Tom Donohue, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce chief executive, told CNBC.
What's maddening about Trump's approach at a practical level is that many nations, including the United States' traditional democratic allies, see China as a bad actor tearing up trade rules not to its liking and regularly violating intellectual property rights. But rather than going about the patient work of building support for what should be a broad and united front against China's abuses, Trump's erratic approach is making it easier for China to cast the United States as the heavy. This does not put the interests of America first.
And Trump's affection for dictatorships is squandering the high ground our country has historically been able to occupy, even in the face of our imperfections and inconsistencies. Championing democracy is not simply the right thing to do. It is a strategic asset. It is also in our national interest at a time when democracy is under challenge from both China and Russia and faces nationalist threats in countries whose free institutions once seemed secure.
Our president has already done grave damage to our nation's domestic fabric by dividing us against one another, provoking both racism and nativism, and seeking to delegitimize all who stand against him. Now, his nihilism is wreaking havoc on our economy and around the world. This is the place where a slapdash, value-free approach to governing was bound to lead us.

FDA FACES DEADLINE ON CIGARETTE PACKS: The Food and Drug Administration faces a court-ordered deadline Thursday to issue a proposal that would require cigarette packets and ads to carry graphic warning labels.
Many other countries already require such labels. The U.S. version would mandate that tobacco companies display color graphics on the upper half of the front and back of packets, and on 20% of the space on print advertisements. The images will depict the health consequences of smoking and are meant to turn off potential smokers and urge people who currently smoke to quit.
The deadline ahead comes after federal Judge Indira Talwani, a Barack Obama appointee, ruled in 2018 that the FDA “unlawfully withheld” and “unreasonably delayed” action on putting out rules about the graphics, and then earlier this year ordered the agency to issue the proposed rule by Aug. 15. The final rule is due March 15, 2020.
The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act passed in 2009 allowed the FDA to regulate tobacco products, and with that also came rules for graphic warning labels. The law said that FDA had until June 22, 2011, to issue a final rule on the warnings, and though the agency had issued them on time, the rules were struck down by federal Judge Richard Leon, who recommended the labels contain “only purely factual and uncontroversial information rather than gruesome images designed to disgust the consumer.” The labels included images of decaying lungs and teeth, and one of them depicted a man smoking through his tracheostomy.
A three-judge panel upheld the ruling, saying the labels violated the First Amendment and telling the FDA to re-draft the labels. It said the agency didn’t provide “a shred of evidence” showing that the warnings would reduce the number of smokers in the U.S.
The ruling was narrowly issued, meaning that it struck down the specific FDA rule and not the overall requirement that cigarette packets contain graphic warning labels.
The court denied the petition for a rehearing, and the government in 2013 decided not to seek further court action. Still, the FDA hasn't yet reissued the labels. As a result, eight public health groups filed suit against the FDA almost three years ago to force the agency to put out the rules, which may come as early as Wednesday but need to arrive no later than Thursday.

PRESCRIPTION DRUG USE HIGHER IN THE US THAN IN CANADA: Data released Wednesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicates that among adults ages 40-79 in the U.S., 69% used one or more prescription drugs in the past 30 days and 22.4% used five or more. In comparison, 65.5% Canadian adults in that same age group used one or more prescription drugs in the past 30 days and 18.8% used five or more.
Antidepressants and cholesterol-lowering drugs were much more common among Americans: The study found that 15.4% of Americans between the ages of 40-59 took antidepressants, while 8.8% of Canadians in that age group took the drugs. Another finding showed 13.9% of Americans in middle age took cholesterol-lowering drugs, while 8.1% of Canadians did.
EMPLOYEES TO TAKE ON $4,500 IN AVERAGE HEALTHCARE COSTS IN 2020: Employers project that the total cost of health benefits will rise 5% in 2020, according to the 2020 Large Employers' Health Care Strategy and Plan Design Survey released Tuesday. When counting both premiums and out-of-pocket costs, healthcare expected to cost $14,642 per employee this year and rise to $15,375 in 2020, with employers paying for 70% of the costs. Just over half of those surveyed said that next year they plan to offer their employees more options for receiving care virtually.
STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL CRITICIZE HHS MOVE TO ROLL BACK OBAMACARE ANTI-DISCRIMINATION RULE: California Attorney General Xavier Becerra and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey led 22 state attorneys general in criticizing Health and Human Services for a proposed rule that would roll back LGBT anti-discrimination provisions in Obamacare.
Roger Severino, director of the Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights, said in May when the rule was proposed that the agency’s tradition of protecting all groups against discrimination and substandard healthcare was “unwavering,” but he didn’t say in the announcement whether the rule would allow providers to deny care to transgender patients.
OVERDOSE DEATHS HAVE INCREASED EVEN AS LEGAL FENTANYL SALES HAVE DECLINED: Legal fentanyl sold and dispensed by pharmacists decreased by almost 30% from 2014 to 2017, but overdose deaths on synthetic opioids like fentanyl increased 414% in that same timeframe, according to a study by Avalere healthcare consulting firm. Kelly Brantley, managing director at Avalere, said: “Public data cannot distinguish between opioid overdose deaths from legitimate pharmaceuticals and illegally manufactured products...Much of the evidence shows that recent increases in fentanyl-related deaths are linked to illicit products.”
FOR THE FIRST TIME, EXPERT PANEL RECOMMENDS SCREENING FOR ADDICTION AND ILLEGAL DRUG USE: For the first time, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, an independent panel of health experts, has issued a draft recommendation that primary care doctors screen their patients for drug use.
Many doctors already check patients for drug use. “We may not be checking boxes on a screen, but we’re mentally checking boxes saying something is wrong,” Dr. Gary LeRoy, president-elect of the American Academy of Family Physicians, told Stat News.
WARREN WANTS TO HAVE GOVERNMENT COVER ‘GENDER-AFFIRMING HEALTH CARE’: Democratic Presidential contender Elizabeth Warren said Tuesday she wants to cover gender-reassignment surgery under her plan for government-funded healthcare. She was criticized in January for saying in 2012 alongside fellow senator Scott Brown, a Republican, that she didn’t favor spending taxpayer dollars on surgery for a transgender inmate in Massachusetts.

Texto completo: Economists have long hated the mortgage interest deduction, but politicians have long considered it untouchable. Then, in 2017 — after much wrangling and over the objections of several suburban members of Congress — Republicans capped the deduction as part of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act.
Now there is new evidence on the effects of that law — and the case for eliminating the mortgage interest deduction just got a little stronger.
After 1986, when Congress eliminated deductibility of interest on personal loans and increased the size of the standard deduction, the mortgage interest deduction was on life support. Add in the factor of declining interest rates, and the deduction was nearly useless for the vast majority of taxpayers.
The National Association of Realtors responded, warning that any effort to cut the deduction would mean the end of the American dream. Congress abandoned the effort.
Even the 2017 effort was a compromise. House Republicans wanted to cap the benefit at the first $500,000 of a mortgage balance. The Senate raised the cap to $750,000 and grandfathered in existing homeowners.
Yet, as The New York Times reports, citing IRS data, only 8% of taxpayers claimed the deduction in 2018, compared with 21% in 2017. The percentage of taxpayers earning $100,000 to $200,000 annually who claimed the deduction declined from 61% to 21%.
Congress should act now to eliminate the mortgage interest deduction before the movement to revive it gains any steam.

Ink-stained Tears Mark End Of Run For Vindicator

Texto completo: YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio -When the press stops rolling at The Vindicator this month, a lingering question once again will taunt the residents of the Mahoning Valley: How much collapse can one region take?
The family-owned newspaper announced in June, just days after celebrating its 150th anniversary, that it is ceasing production Aug. 31. Started in 1869 just months after Ulysses S. Grant was sworn into office, it has been run by the descendants of William F. Maag ever since he purchased it midway through Grover Cleveland’s first term.
The closure will cost 144 employees and 250 carriers their jobs and comes just weeks after the General Motors Lordstown plant down the road turned out the lights, leading to thousands of job losses.
It is one of a series of gut punches that has dented this area’s spirit since the collapse of the steel industry in September 1977. But losing a local newspaper feels like a bigger blow than most.
“Newspapers are the watchdogs who hold our civic institutions accountable and act as a cheerleader for the unique fabrics in our society,” Democratic presidential candidate Rep. Tim Ryan, the congressman who represents this region, told The New York Post.
As a young high school football star, Ryan enjoyed glowing coverage in The Vindicator. And as an elected official, he has felt the sting of its criticism.
“We’ve had our share of tensions, and they certainly have held me accountable, but that is their job - to be that check on government -and I cannot imagine our community without them,” he said.
Closures like The Vindicator’s are sadly more common than ever across the country, as old-school newsrooms struggle to compete with digital operations that aggregate web content but lack editorial oversight or seasoned reporters who have a deep understanding of their local area.
In the past 15 years, the country has lost 1,800 local news organizations, according to a report by the University of North Carolina Center for Innovation and Sustainability in Local Media. Half of the country’s 3,143 counties have just one newspaper to cover sprawling, often isolated territories, while nearly 200 counties have no newspaper at all, the report said.
“A local newspaper is to a community what a central nervous system is to a body,” said Paul Sracic, a political science professor at Youngstown State University. “Like the nerves in our body, the newspaper transmits vital and non-vital information throughout the community.”
And without that, it’s very difficult for a community to maintain its sense of self.
At the local school, Becky Ford has used The Vindicator as a resource for the American history and social studies classes she teaches. She also relies on it to stay connected with her community. “For us, it was like our New York Times,” Ford said. “Sports, features, local social clubs, volunteer activities, class reunions ... you name it, they did it. If you called The Vindicator and asked (them) to be at your event, they were at your event taking pictures.”
High school athletes, in particular, will suffer from a lack of coverage, said Rick Shepas, athletic director of Youngstown city schools.
It will be “devastating for the kids and their families not to have The Vindicator write those daily articles about the student-athlete’s accomplishments both on and off the field,” he said.
After 150 years of chronicling the Ohio Valley, beginning with the Reconstruction and followed by the Industrial Revolution, two World Wars, a Great Depression, civil rights, a moon landing, the Vietnam War, Watergate and 9/11, it is hard to believe that The Vindicator is no more.
Although the internet is a great source of information, the virtual communities that exist on sites like Reddit aren’t local or even identifiable.
Youngstown Mayor Jamael Tito Brown worries that the disruption won’t stop at the city line.
“This is a problem for our whole country,” Brown said. “Communities suffer when local journalism closes up shop, and we lose our vitality and connection to each other when that door closes for the last time. The bigger problem is: How are we going to stop those doors from closing here - or anywhere?”

China Wages a Manipulated Information War Against Demonstrators

Texto completo: BEIJING -- When a projectile struck a Hong Kong woman in the eye this week as protesters clashed with the police, China responded quickly: Its state television network reported that the woman had been injured not by one of the police's bean bag rounds, but by a protester.
The network's website went further: It posted what it said was a photo of the woman counting out cash on a Hong Kong sidewalk -- insinuating, as Chinese reports have claimed before, that the protesters are merely paid provocateurs.
The assertion was more than just spin or fake news. The Communist Party exerts overwhelming control over media content inside China's so-called Great Firewall, and it is now using it as a cudgel in an information war over the protests that have convulsed Hong Kong for months.
In recent days, China has more aggressively stirred up nationalist and anti-Western sentiment using state and social media, and it has manipulated the context of images and videos to undermine the protesters. Chinese officials have begun branding the demonstrations as a prelude to terrorism.
The result, both in mainland China and abroad, has been to create an alternate version of what, seen from Hong Kong, is clearly a popular demonstration movement. In China's version, a small, violent gang of protesters, unsupported by residents and provoked by foreign agents, is running rampant, calling for Hong Kong's independence and tearing China apart.
This narrative almost certainly reflects that of the country's leaders, including Xi Jinping, and it is fueling misunderstanding -- and, increasingly, anger -- among the Chinese public. That could, in turn, raise pressure on the government, increasing the risk of an overreaction or miscalculation based on limited or inaccurate information.
People posting on Weibo, a Chinese social media service similar to Twitter, are increasingly calling for Beijing to act. "Beating them to a pulp is not enough," one person said about protesters on Tuesday, echoing an increasingly common sentiment on Weibo. "They must be beaten to death. Just send a few tanks over to clean them up."
Since China's censors have the ability to quickly remove offending comments, the abundance of them suggests that the government is willing to tolerate the warning they deliver, however ominous it sounds.
China has long curated the content that it allows its citizens to see and read. Its new campaign has echoes of tactics used by other countries, principally Russia, to inundate domestic and international audiences with bursts of information, propaganda and, in some cases, outright disinformation.
"Propagandists observe each other across borders, and they learn from each other," said Peter Pomerantsev, the author of "This is Not Propaganda," a new book that describes how authoritarian governments have weaponized social media that were once hailed as harbingers for democratic ideals.
The disinformation has clearly been aimed at undermining sympathy for the Hong Kong protesters' goals, which now include demands for greater democratic freedoms for the territory's seven million residents.
Propaganda in the traditional sense, Mr. Pomerantsev said, would try to win over an audience, while disinformation is meant simply to sow confusion and fuel conspiracies.
"You have to smother everything with doubt, and conspiracy is very effective in creating that," Mr. Pomerantsev said in a telephone interview.
Though China's disinformation network has received less global attention than Russia's, the country's officials have, over the last decade, built a machinery of online controls that far exceed any other country's.
Many overseas websites are blocked in China. Censors embedded within its internet companies delete anything unacceptable. The police have arrested people who speak out of turn in chat groups, or who share sensitive content online.
The state media -- whose history of propagandizing stretches back to Mao Zedong's era -- have also made powerful inroads in the new media online, filling the mainland's information vacuum with an officially Sinicized worldview.
Hong Kong, which Britain returned to Chinese rule in 1997, remains outside China's firewall, and thus is sitting along one of the world's most profound online divides. Preserving the city's freedom to live without the mainland's controls has become one of the causes now motivating the protests.
"Deep inside, mainlanders and Hong Kong people have very different life experiences and emotions," said Fang Kecheng, an assistant professor of journalism at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. "Without the shared emotions, it's not easy for mainlanders -- even those who can freely access information -- to empathize with Hong Kong people, which is an important explanation for how the government has been able to create a parallel universe of narratives."
China's new aggressiveness in the effort represents a shift in tactics. When large protests erupted in June over the Hong Kong government's proposed law allowing the extradition of criminal suspects to the mainland, China's state media -- and officials -- largely ignored them.
That changed on July 1, when protesters stormed Hong Kong's Legislative Council building after a day of peaceful demonstrations. A flurry of articles and editorials in China's state media followed, condemning the vandalism and violence -- without explaining what the protesters were protesting about.
Since then, the state media have vigorously defended the police in Hong Kong, belittled the protesters and accused Westerners of orchestrating the turmoil. Efforts to contextualize the situation or express sympathy for the protesters were swiftly purged from social media.
The propaganda campaign intensified after July 21, when protesters surrounded the Chinese government's main office in Hong Kong and threw black ink on a government emblem. And when a Chinese flag was thrown into Victoria Harbor on Aug. 3, the reaction in China -- at least online, stoked by state media -- reached a fevered pitch.
"The five-star flag has 1.4 billion guardians," CCTV wrote indignantly to its 87 million followers on Weibo. "Repost! 'I am a guardian of the flag!' "
It was reposted by more than 10 million people, including Jackie Chan, the Hong Kong martial arts film star. On Twitter, which is banned in China, the People's Daily later reposted CCTV's original post, giving it an international audience.
Just across the border from Hong Kong, in the city of Shenzhen, the Chinese security forces have conducted large-scale operations in recent days, in a nationalistic display that got prominent coverage in the state media.
Other media reports have been outright deceptive. A video appeared on Monday showing a protester with a toy weapon used in Airsoft -- a Paintball-like game that is popular in Hong Kong. The China Daily, a newspaper of the Communist Party, circulated it widely as evidence that the protesters had taken up arms, identifying the toy as an M320 grenade launcher used by the United States Army.
"What is the difference between this and the terrorists!" read one reply. "How long must we tolerate this?"
"What Is America Up To?" has become a hashtag promoted by CCTV on social media, according to Manya Koetse, the editor of What's On Weibo, a site that monitors trends on the platform. Other posts celebrate the Hong Kong police as embattled heroes, while Hong Kong residents are regularly portrayed as spoiled.
The yawning power imbalance, from an information-warfare point of view, has frustrated many protesters as they try to outline their demands and clarify what has actually happened in the streets.
During a peaceful sit-in at Hong Kong's airport late last month, protesters sought to explain their demands to arriving passengers, including travelers from the mainland. But the Chinese media promoted a video of a few protesters harassing a white-haired traveler who had ripped a poster out of a demonstrator's hands.
"Witness said the old man refused to take leaflet demonstrators gave out. I think old people don't deserve this no matter what is the reason," the editor of The Global Times, Hu Xijin, wrote on Twitter, with a video that only showed protesters confronting the man.
"These young people have lost all compassion for political frenzy," he added.

Texto completo: Placido Domingo, one of the world's most recognizable and accomplished opera singers, has been accused of sexually inappropriate behavior by multiple women.
Nine women told the Associated Press that they were sexually harassed by the long-married, Spanish-born superstar in encounters that took place over three decades beginning in the late 1980s. A half-dozen other women told the AP that suggestive overtures by Domingo, 78, made them uncomfortable.
Here is what is known about the allegations:
'Every time I would walk off stage, he would be in the wings waiting for me'
Eight singers and a dancer told the AP that Domingo sexually harassed them, and six additional accusers said Domingo's actions made them uncomfortable.
One singer said Domingo repeatedly asked her out on dates after hiring her to sing a series of concerts with him in the 1990s.
"Every time I would walk off stage, he would be in the wings waiting for me," said Patricia Wulf, who performed with Domingo at the Washington Opera. "He would come right up to me, as close as could be, put his face right in my face, lower his voice and say, 'Patricia, do you have to go home tonight?' "
Other accusers' accounts were more graphic.
One woman described how Domingo reached down her skirt, and three reported that Domingo gave them unwanted kisses on the lips.
Several women said Domingo hired them or offered to help their careers before relentlessly pursuing them. When they rejected him, they said, Domingo would decline to give them additional roles within the opera company he was working with at the time.
A 'well-known secret'
Wulf called his behavior a "well-known secret."
Two of the women said they submitted to Domingo's advances, fearing that rejecting him would jeopardize their careers. One woman said she had sex with him twice and described how he left her $10, saying, "I don't want you to feel like a prostitute, but I also don't want you to have to pay to park."
Domingo calls the allegations 'inaccurate,' promises he will 'hold myself to the highest standards'
"The allegations from these unnamed individuals dating back as many as 30 years are deeply troubling, and as presented, inaccurate," Domingo said in a statement.
"Still, it is painful to hear that I may have upset anyone or made them feel uncomfortable – no matter how long ago and despite my best intentions. I believed that all of my interactions and relationships were always welcomed and consensual. People who know me or who have worked with me know that I am not someone who would intentionally harm, offend, or embarrass anyone.
"However, I recognize that the rules and standards by which we are – and should be – measured against today are very different than they were in the past. I am blessed and privileged to have had a more than 50-year career in opera and will hold myself to the highest standards."
The singer has been married for more than 50 years
Domingo first married at age 16 to Ana Maria Guerra Cue, a short union that produced their son Jose, according to U.K. outlets The Independent and The Times.
He married his second wife, Marta Ornelas, on Aug. 1, 1962, when he was 21. Ornelas was a soprano whom Domingo met during conservatory, and after a stint of performing together as a couple, Ornelas retired to take care of their children: Pl cido Domingo Jr., now 54, and Alvaro Maurizio, now 51.
The opera world has been largely silent so far
Officials at the Los Angeles Opera and the Metropolitan Opera, two companies with which Domingo is scheduled to perform this season, declined to comment to The New York Times, as did the Washington National Opera.
USA TODAY has reached out to the opera companies for further comment.

Texto completo: NEW YORK - It was the weekend that shaped the image of a "Woodstock Generation." And that image would echo, appeal and provoke for generations to come.
To many who went or wished they did, the pivotal festival of "peace and music" 50 years ago remains an inspiring moment of counterculture community and youthful freethinking.
"We went for the music and found something so much more, and so much more important - camaraderie," says Karen Breda, who was 17 when she went to Woodstock. She recalls feeling part of "a generation that felt like nothing could stop us. Peace. Love. The whole thing."
Some other Americans saw Woodstock as an outrageous display of indulgence and insouciance in a time of war. And some didn't look to Woodstock to celebrate their own sense of music and identity.
"There was no one baby boomer generation. There was no one approach to what Woodstock meant," says David Farber, a University of Kansas professor of American history. But Woodstock became an "aspirational vision of what countercultural youth thought they could achieve in the United States."
Breda didn't go to Woodstock looking for a societal vision. She was fresh out of high school and liked rock concerts, and the three-day lineup was packed with acts including The Who, Jimi Hendrix, Jefferson Airplane and Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young.
After lying to her parents about her destination, Breda arrived from Boston to find a mind-boggling mass of people, tents, blankets, pot smoke, patchouli and underpreparedness.
Organizers had sold 186,000 tickets; ultimately an estimated 400,000 people showed up for the festival on farmland in Bethel, New York, about 80 miles (130 kilometers) northwest of New York City.
Space, water and toilets were in short supply. Security was thin. Rain and mud abounded. Breda and her friends slept in their car after getting separated from another vehicle carrying their camping supplies. It was a trek to get near the stage.
But what she remembers most was happening in the crowd - concertgoers meeting each other, sharing what they had, playing guitars together.
At a time of bitter protests over the Vietnam War, Woodstock "seemed to transcend the anger that clearly a lot of people were feeling. It was about being together. It was about helping out someone that needed something," says Breda, now a nursing professor at the University of Hartford in Connecticut. "The music spoke for us."
Concertgoers weren't the only ones struck by the fellow-feeling and calm in the crowd - despite scores of drug arrests, medical problems ranging from cut-up bare feet to LSD freakouts, and two deaths, one from a heroin overdose and another when a teen was run over, according to The Associated Press' reporting from the time.
There were no reports of violence, and a local police chief called the crowd "the most courteous, considerate and well-behaved group of kids" he'd encountered in his career. Max Yasgur, the dairy farmer who leased his land to the festival, said meeting them "forced me to open my eyes."
He added: 'I think America has to take notice."
It did. Often with scorn.
Many Americans saw Woodstock as a spectacle of spaced-out, skinny-dipping, promiscuous hippies cavorting in squalor - with "little more sanity than the impulses that drive the lemmings to march to their deaths in the sea," as a New York Times editorial put it (while allowing that "the freakish-looking intruders behaved astonishingly well".
And for some, Woodstock would serve as an enduring symbol of the divides of the Vietnam War - on one side a thong of young people gathered for "peace and music," on the other more than a half-million of their peers fighting in Vietnam.
"I'm sure it was a cultural and pharmaceutical event. I was tied up at the time," the late Sen. John McCain famously said in 2017.
His remark - an allusion to his 5 1/2 years as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam - got a standing ovation from a Republican presidential primary debate audience. The former Navy pilot would later earn the nomination.
Two years later, the Veterans of Foreign Wars' magazine marked Woodstock's 40th anniversary with a cover story spotlighting some 109 service members who died in Vietnam during the festival and "are never lauded by the illustrious spokesmen for the 'Sixties Generation.'"
The Woodstock audience did include at least one Vietnam veteran, snapped in a well-known photo . Performers included Country Joe McDonald, a Navy veteran who served mainly in Japan. His anti-war "I Feel Like I'm Fixin' To Die Rag" became a memorable Woodstock moment.
"Some people alluded to peace and stuff, but I was talking about Vietnam," McDonald said in a phone interview.
The song's profane introductory cheer "is an expression of our anger and frustration over the Vietnam War, which was killing us, literally killing us," said the singer, who helped spearhead the creation of Vietnam veterans' memorial in Berkeley, California, in the 1990s.
On the same day his band, Country Joe & the Fish, played at Woodstock, another audience of thousands was in a Harlem park for a concert with its own sense of community and yearnings to challenge the status quo. Headliner Nina Simone delivered a set infused with songs of black empowerment and a militant poem that asked black people "are you ready" to instigate social change.
The show was part of the Harlem Cultural Festival, a concert series that would later be dubbed a "Black Woodstock."
Over six summer Sundays, an estimated 300,000 people in total gathered to see acts including Stevie Wonder, Gladys Knight & the Pips and - like the upstate Woodstock crowd - Sly and the Family Stone.
"It was like a mini-Woodstock to a lot of people," says Ethel Beatty Barnes, who saw the Sly and the Family Stone concert that July, when she was an 18-year-old New Yorker.
Her mother wouldn't let her go to Woodstock. But Beatty Barnes feels the city-sponsored Harlem festival, which was showcased in two network TV specials, showed people didn't have to go far to come together around music.
"It was embarking onto 'what do we have already here where we can have people gather?'" says Beatty Barnes, who became a Broadway actress and singer. "It was a really great thing."
A half-century later, the Harlem Cultural Festival's anniversary is being marked with events including a concert in the same park, hosted by rapper and activist Talib Kweli. It's part of Future X Sounds, a socially conscious concert series.
Meanwhile, four days of concerts and events are planned at the Woodstock site, now the Bethel Woods Center for the Arts.
The lineup includes 1969 performers Santana and John Fogerty, but the arts center has made clear it isn't hosting a freewheeling festival: Spectators will need tickets and checkpoint travel passes to get to the site. Plans for a sprawling commemorative Woodstock 50 event elsewhere collapsed amid permitting and other problems.
Thinking back, Breda rues that "subsequent generations didn't have the opportunity to experience something that I consider to have been so beautiful."
But, she says: "It feels like something that could never happen again."

Joaquin Castro's Trump donor tweet was blatant intimidation

Texto completo: Democratic Texas Rep. Joaquin Castro, brother of Democratic presidential candidate Julián Castro, tweeted a target list of individuals and businesses in San Antonio who have donated to President Trump. This was not a list of public figures or high-profile mega-donors. It was a collection of private citizens who had donated only $2,800, including 11 retirees and a homemaker.
The individuals on the list are Castro’s own constituents. So much for “representation” in Washington.
Democratic apologists argue this exposure, the malicious publishing of a person’s act of free speech, wasn’t a big deal since the information is already available for those who dig hard enough to find it. They call it “following the money.” But let me tell you something: This simple act did more damage to our republic than a stupid Russian Facebook ad could ever accomplish.
Castro’s intentions were clear. He wanted to scare private citizens away from donating to the Trump presidential reelection campaign. He wanted to funnel the outpour of anger following the string of mass shootings last week in the direction of Trump donors in his own home district.
House Democrats are not unilaterally defending Castro, but they did implicitly endorse the idea of donor exposure back in March when they passed one of the most unconstitutional, anti-speech pieces of legislation in years, the so-called "For the People Act," or H.R. 1.
If signed into law, H.R. 1 would have forced political organizations to reveal their donors, causing a profound chilling effect on political speech. The Supreme Court already shut down this type of donor-doxing in the landmark civil rights case, NAACP v. Alabama, when it ruled the NAACP did not have to disclose its membership lists.
In its wisdom, the court understood that forcing the NAACP to disclose its donors would be unconstitutional and lead to potentially life-threatening intimidation. Democrats like Rep. Castro seemed to have missed this crucial lesson from our nation's history. Or worse, they understand it, but choose to ignore it for their own selfish political impulses.
The radical wing of the Democratic Party operates on two tactics: shut down and shout down. Whether they are campaigning or governing, those tactics never change. Don't like the politics of a small-business owner? Damage her reputation until the doors close.
Don't like a speaker on a college campus? Heckle him until the event gets canceled. Don’t like someone making fun of you on Twitter? Threaten them with your newfound congressional subpoena power.
Don’t like a New York Times print edition headline? Bully them until they change the headline to something else in the digital edition. Don't like your constituents voting for your brother’s political opponent? Release the names and businesses of their individual donors in your district.
There is no acceptable explanation for Castro’s tweet. He wanted private citizens in his own district to wake up to harassment, lost business, or worse, simply because they had the audacity to participate in the democratic process. He published that tweet as a green light of permission for the radical progressive mob to shout those people down and shut them up.
This included several of his own donors, who had also donated to the Trump campaign. Something tells me Castro won’t be able to count on their votes or donations the next time around.
The radical Left doesn't believe in the open exchange of ideas – they believe in a forced consensus around their political agenda. If they can't alleviate your dissent, they will try like hell to make sure nobody hears it.

Texto completo: U.S. Rep. Cheri Bustos, D-East Moline, is leading the Democratic Party's effort to wipe out House Republicans in the 2020 election.

But before she gets her chance to do that, Bustos, who represents the Quad Cities area, is caught up in a civil war waged by her own party's practitioners of identity politics.

Earlier this year, the liberal Bustos, who leads the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, was blasted by uber-liberals, including U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. The high-profile Cortez and her like-minded associates excoriated Bustos over her decision not to allow the DCCC to work with any political consultants or vendors who involve themselves in party primary campaigns aimed at unseating House Democratic incumbents.

She won that battle, at least for the time being.

But just last month, Bustos was again targeted by intra-party critics who charged that she is racially insensitive for not hiring enough Hispanic and black staffers to work for her at the DCCC.

Bustos lost the second fight, ultimately agreeing both to attend racial-sensitivity training sessions as well as fire six top-level DCCC staffers.

Among the casualties was executive director Allison Jaslow, a white female who was sacrificed on the altar of inclusion even though she is a lesbian.

"To my colleagues, who I have the upmost respect for, I hear your concerns, and we can and must do better. ... I will work tirelessly to ensure that our staff is truly inclusive," said Bustos, who represents Illinois' 17th congressional district.

Part of Bustos' dispute with her critics is political. Charged with keeping the House under Democratic control, Bustos sees her job as protecting liberal Democrats elected in 2018 in House districts that President Donald Trump carried in the 2016 election.

These same incumbents plus other establishment Democrats holding House seats across the country have been targeted for defeat by Ocasio-Cortez and her socialist colleagues known as "The Squad."

At the same time, Bustos' critics are animated by issues of skin color and ethnicity.

One of Bustos' big mistakes occurred earlier this year, when she brought in a group of political consultants to talk strategy with the DCCC leadership. All of the consultants were white, enraging blacks and Hispanics who were in attendance.

U.S. Rep. Marcia Fudge, D-Ohio, said she found it "shocking" that there is "not one person of color -- black or brown, that I'm aware of -- at any position of authority or decision-making in the DCCC."

Ironically, some of the people who both have left or been targeted for dismissal are black.

Bustos' chief of staff, Jalisa Washington, a black woman, left the DCCC to work for Sen. Kamala Harris' presidential campaign. Bustos was criticized for failing to retain Washington.

When Bustos promoted another black woman, Tayhlor Coleman, Hispanics were angry because Coleman was linked to a series of 10-year-old tweets construed as critical of Hispanics.

The 57-year-old Bustos has also proved to be a gaffe machine when it comes to her public statements or personal interactions with members of minority groups.

After she was elected to head the DCCC, Bustos promised to "finally" put together an effective campaign organization. That statement was, unsurprisingly, perceived to be a criticism of the outgoing DCCC chairman who led Democratic efforts to win back the House in 2018 -- U.S. Rep. Ben Ray Lujan, D-N.M.

Bustos has also ruffled feathers when defending herself against assertions that she is insensitive to minorities. She has cited her marriage to a Hispanic man and her son's engagement to a black woman as proof of her virtue on that issue.

Those to whom she spoke, however, were offended, considering the citing of family relationships to be condescending.

One of her defenders, U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, D-Mo., called Bustos a "very good person" who made a "very dumb statement" regarding her family.

Bustos, the daughter of prominent Democratic insider Gene Callahan, was tapped for the top job at the DCCC because she is, according to the New York Times, "viewed as a rising Democratic star who had cracked the code on appealing to white working-class voters."

In other words, Bustos knows how to persuade that peculiar species known as "Trump supporters" to vote for liberal Democrats.

As proof, Democrats noted that Bustos easily won re-election in a House district carried by Trump.

That's true, but not totally persuasive.

Trump barely carried the district, while Bustos is considered so politically safe that Republicans have not mounted serious opposition to her in recent elections.

The tumult at the DCCC has calmed considerably since Bustos acquiesced to her critics' demands and purged her staff. But the organization that once was described as "in full-blown turmoil" under her leadership is still rife with discontent and distracted from its 2020 goal of defeating the GOP.

Texto completo: The New York Times said in a statement on Tuesday that Jonathan Weisman, a deputy Washington editor of The Times, had been demoted and would no longer oversee the paper's congressional correspondents because he repeatedly posted messages on social media about race and politics that showed what the paper called "serious lapses in judgment."
Mr. Weisman, 53, will lose the title of deputy editor, a designation for Times editors with wide-ranging duties and significant input into news coverage, a spokeswoman for the paper said.
Mr. Weisman met with Dean Baquet, the executive editor of The Times, on Tuesday and apologized, the Times statement said. He will also no longer be "active on social media," the statement added.
In a brief interview after the meeting with Mr. Baquet, Mr. Weisman, who will stay on at the paper as an editor, said: "I accept Dean's judgment. I think he's right to do what he's doing. I embarrassed the newspaper, and he had to act."
The reprimand came amid a broader discussion in the Times newsroom of how the paper covers race and the Trump administration in a polarized time. On Monday, Mr. Baquet led a staff meeting at which a recent front-page headline that generated heavy public criticism was a main topic.
Mr. Weisman, who joined The Times in 2012, was under scrutiny for messages he posted on Twitter on July 31 and Aug. 7. In the July 31 posts, he implied that it was inaccurate to describe certain politicians from urban areas as being representative of the Midwest and the South. He specifically mentioned four Democrats: Representatives Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Lloyd Doggett of Texas and John Lewis of Georgia. Three of the four are minorities.
"Saying @RashidaTlaib (D-Detroit) and @IlhanMN (D-Minneapolis) are from the Midwest is like saying @RepLloydDoggett (D-Austin) is from Texas or @repjohnlewis (D-Atlanta) is from the Deep South," Mr. Weisman wrote. "C'mon."
Mr. Weisman, who is white, deleted the tweet and a pair of follow-ups after they were criticized as racist on Twitter and in the African-American-focused online publication The Root.
The Times's standards editor, Phil Corbett, advised Mr. Weisman to be more careful on social media, Mr. Weisman said. But on Aug. 7, he ventured into similar territory.
Replying to a Twitter post by the progressive political organization Justice Democrats that included a photograph of Morgan Harper, a candidate the group was backing for a United States House seat in Ohio, Mr. Weisman noted that she would be challenging Representative Joyce Beatty, an African-American Democrat.
Ms. Harper quickly replied to Mr. Weisman's message, telling him, "I am also black."
To that, Mr. Weisman replied, "@justicedems's endorsement included a photo," as if that settled the matter.
Roxane Gay, a contributing opinion writer to The Times since 2015, joined the discussion with a tweet that said, "Any time you think you're unqualified for a job remember that this guy, telling a black woman she isn't black because he looked at a picture and can't see, has one of the most prestigious jobs in America."
According to screenshots posted by Ms. Gay, Mr. Weisman sent messages to her saying she owed him "an enormous apology." Ms. Gay made it clear in a subsequent tweet that she strongly disagreed with Mr. Weisman's demand.
Erica Green, a national education reporter at The Times, said in an interview that she understood why the tweets by Mr. Weisman, who was her editor, had provoked a backlash. She also defended him as a journalist and colleague, based on her experiences working with him on stories about minorities.
"As a black woman, I feel a little bit better that he is in the room," Ms. Green said.
Mr. Weisman, the author of the 2018 book "(((Semitism))): Being Jewish in America in the Age of Trump," stepped away from Twitter for a few months in 2016 after becoming a target of online trolls. Before joining The Times, he worked at newspapers including The Baltimore Sun, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal.
Last week, The Times drew intense criticism -- from readers, some of whom canceled subscriptions; members of its own staff; and prominent politicians -- because of a front-page headline that Mr. Baquet described as "credulous." The headline, "Trump Urges Unity Vs. Racism," was changed for later editions.
In the first edition of the Aug. 6 paper, it sat atop an article that quoted President Trump's prepared remarks on the mass killings in El Paso and Dayton, Ohio, while also noting that Mr. Trump "has himself amplified right-wing voices online with histories of racism and bigotry." Editors changed the headline to "Assailing Hate but Not Guns."
At the staff meeting on Monday, Mr. Baquet acknowledged "a couple of significant missteps" and likened the current political climate to the turbulent 1960s. He asked those in the packed 15th-floor room of The New York Times Building for their help in reporting on a difficult time, an effort that would require the paper's journalists to pay close attention to how they covered race and a divisive administration.
"This is hard stuff," he said, reading from prepared remarks.
Mr. Baquet, who became the first African-American executive editor in the history of The Times in 2014, took responsibility for the much-criticized headline, adding that the paper's print hub, which produces the newspaper's print version, was not given enough space to convey the story fairly.
The other main topic of discussion was the paper's reluctance to describe certain actions and comments by the president and some of his supporters as "racist." Mr. Baquet said that, in general, it was sufficient to describe racist speech and behavior plainly in news articles without necessarily labeling it as such.
"My own view," he said, "is that the best way to capture the kinds of remarks the president makes is to use them, to lay it out in perspective, and that is much more powerful than the use of a word."
Some journalists in attendance expressed disagreement with that view, and Mr. Baquet said he was working with other editors to establish a written standard that would try to clarify when the use of "racist" and similar terms was warranted in news coverage.
Part of the reason for the gathering on Monday, he said, was the online behavior of Mr. Weisman, which seemed emblematic of larger debates inside and outside the newsroom.
"By the way," Mr. Baquet said toward the end of the meeting, "let's catch our breath before tweeting stupid stuff or stuff that hurts the paper."

Texto completo: One of the two people guarding Jeffrey Epstein when he apparently hanged himself in a federal jail cell was not a full-fledged correctional officer, and neither guard had checked on Mr. Epstein for several hours before he was discovered, prison and law-enforcement officials said.
Those details emerged on Monday as Attorney General William P. Barr sharply criticized the management of the federal jail in Manhattan where Mr. Epstein, who was accused of sexually abusing dozens of teenage girls, was found dead on Saturday morning.
"We are now learning of serious irregularities at this facility that are deeply concerning and demand a thorough investigation," said Mr. Barr, who, as the country's top law enforcement official, is responsible for federal prisons.
"We will get to the bottom of what happened," he added. "There will be accountability."
Mr. Barr did not offer additional information about the problems at the jail, but questions have been raised about why Mr. Epstein had been taken off suicide watch just days after apparently trying to kill himself and then was left alone in a cell without close supervision.
Mr. Barr also said Mr. Epstein's suicide would not halt the investigation into other people who might have helped him traffic teenage girls for sex. On Monday, F.B.I. agents and New York detectives raided Mr. Epstein's private, 70-acre island in the United States Virgin Islands, looking for documents, photographs, videos, computers and other materials, people briefed on the matter said.
"Any co-conspirators should not rest easy," Mr. Barr said. "The victims deserve justice and they will get it."
No correctional officer had checked on Mr. Epstein for several hours before he was found, even though guards were supposed to look in on prisoners in the protective unit where he was housed every half-hour, a prison official and two law-enforcement officials with knowledge of the detention said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
In addition, only one of the two people guarding the Special Housing Unit -- known as 9 South -- normally worked as a correctional officer, according to three prison officials with knowledge of the case. The officials did not say what sort of job the other employee usually worked.
A New York Times investigation published last year detailed this practice, under which federal prisons are so strapped for correctional officers that they regularly compel teachers, nurses, secretaries and other support staff members to step in. The practice has grown at some prisons as the Trump administration has curtailed the hiring of correctional officers.
Many of these staff members only receive a few weeks' training in correctional work, and, while required by contract to serve as substitutes, are often uncomfortable in the roles. Even workers who previously held correctional positions have said that the practice was unsettling because fewer colleagues were on hand to provide backup if things turned ugly.
Mr. Epstein's death came just two weeks after he had been taken off suicide watch at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Lower Manhattan, where he apparently had tried to kill himself on July 23, officials said.
He was being held at the detention center awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges. He had been accused of luring dozens of underage girls into giving him erotic massages and engaging in other sexual acts at his mansions in New York City and Palm Beach, Fla.
"I was appalled, and indeed the whole department was, and frankly angry, to learn of the M.C.C.'s failure to adequately secure this prisoner," Mr. Barr said at a conference in New Orleans for the Grand Lodge Fraternal Order of Police.
That Mr. Epstein was taken off suicide watch and left unsupervised long enough to have apparently taken his own life has sparked a public outcry, prompting criticism of the Justice Department and the Bureau of Prisons, which operates the Manhattan jail. Mr. Barr announced Saturday that both the F.B.I. and the Justice Department's inspector general would open respective probes into the circumstances surrounding Mr. Epstein's death.
The Bureau of Prisons declined to comment.
Union officials said that for more than a year officials in Washington had been made aware of a severe staffing shortage at the facility in the wake of a federal hiring freeze. One of the guards on the unit where Mr. Epstein died had been working overtime for five straight days, while the other had been forced to work overtime that day, a union official said.
"The Council of Prison Locals has been sounding the alarm about the hiring freeze," said Eric Young, the president of the union that represents federal prison workers across the country.
An autopsy of Mr. Epstein's body was conducted by the city's medical examiner on Sunday, but a final determination is pending. At the request of Mr. Epstein's lawyers, a private pathologist was permitted to attend the examination, which the city's chief medical examiner, Dr. Barbara Sampson, called a "routine practice."
Since leaving suicide watch on July 29, Mr. Epstein had been housed in 9 South, a secure housing unit in one of the prison's most restrictive wings. His lifeless body was found in his cell around 6:30 a.m., by a guard conducting morning rounds. He had used a bedsheet to hang himself, one official said.
Mr. Epstein was being housed alone. Under normal procedures, he should have had a cellmate, but the inmate housed with him had been recently transferred and had not been replaced, several officials said.
According to Bureau of Prisons' policy, several high-ranking prison officials would have had to have approved Mr. Epstein's removal from the facility's suicide prevention program, including the prison's chief psychologist.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Bullish on Gun Control, Democrats Compete Over Who Can Sell It Best

Texto completo: DES MOINES -- Democrats running for president have engaged in bitter disputes this year over topics like health care, immigration and criminal justice.
But after mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton, Ohio, jolted the nation earlier this month, the field of 2020 contenders seemed to move in lock step toward more aggressive gun control positions without resistance from the party's moderate voices.
The result is that an issue currently at the top of voters' minds is producing little disagreement between the centrist and liberal Democrats seeking the White House. Instead, a contest has emerged over who can deliver the most effective pitch for new gun control measures, with the proper emotional punch.
"On policy, people aren't that far apart," Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said in an interview aboard the Sky Glider gondola at the Iowa State Fair. "I think the difference is who can actually get this done."
[ Sign up for our politics newsletter and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race.]
Democrats are used to arguing over health care, a debate that has been central to the party's identity for decades. But there hasn't been a robust policy discussion on gun control in a presidential primary since 2000, when Vice President Al Gore and former Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey debated the wisdom of a national gun licensing system.
Now, candidates are navigating a Democratic electorate driven in part by young voters who came of age in the mass shooting era and who have little tolerance for kowtowing to a long-held view that gun rights are sacrosanct. The idea of a gun licensing system has returned to the center of the discussion, backed by candidates like Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, and many candidates have vowed to reinstate a ban on assault-style weapons.
The more modest playbook of recent years -- calling for universal background checks on gun purchasers and more federal funding for research into gun violence -- no longer satisfies Democrats, even though both proposals are anathema to Republicans aligned with the National Rifle Association.
"Democrats running for president, I think, have got to be bolder than what they are on this gun issue," former Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa said Sunday after appearing at an event in West Des Moines with Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York.
In the health care debate, candidates from the party's centrist wing have warned of scaring off voters with ambitious plans like "Medicare for all." But there is no Democrat in the race warning that aggressive gun control proposals go too far.
Asked if it was possible for the party's nominee to go too far on gun control, Ms. Gillibrand replied: "No. I think the American people are behind us."
Nowhere was the power of the movement -- and new financing behind it -- more evident than Saturday in Des Moines, where 16 presidential candidates appeared at a gun violence forum organized in less than a week by Everytown for Gun Safety, the gun control organization financed primarily by Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor.
"I have to tell you, it says a lot about how much you've accomplished that so many presidential candidates are here today," Mr. Bloomberg told a crowd of local activists and gun violence survivors who were bused and flown in for the event. "The big reason for the historic unity in the Democratic Party on guns, and the reason this historic gathering has come together, is that we built a grass-roots army with six million supporters."
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts used the Everytown forum to roll out a plan that set a goal of reducing gun deaths by 80 percent and called for a gun licensing program. On Sunday, former Representative Beto O'Rourke of Texas also came out for gun licensing, as have several other candidates.
And former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., in an opinion piece published this week in The New York Times, said he wanted to reinstate the ban on assault-style weapons he championed in 1994. (The prohibition expired when Republicans who controlled Congress in 2004 declined to renew it.)
Mr. Booker, who unveiled a gun control plan in May, said in an interview that calling only for background checks and a ban on assault-style weapons was not sufficient to solve the nation's gun violence problem.
"We need to shift the terms of this debate and make solutions bolder, more evidence-based and shift what people think of as common sense," Mr. Booker said.
Despite Mr. Booker's push, Democrats interviewed at the Everytown forum and elsewhere in Iowa this weekend struggled to identify significant differences among the candidates' approaches to gun control.
"They pretty much all had the same message," said Anne Suchomel, 71, who traveled from southeast Minnesota to attend the forum in Des Moines.
At the state fair pork chop line, Scott Kirkpatrick, a retired golf professional from nearby Windsor Heights, Iowa, said he failed to see "much difference between any of them on guns."
In Iowa's rural precincts, Democratic officials warned that talk of licensing and bans on types of weapons were likely to repel voters in places where gun ownership rates are higher than in urban Des Moines.
"One big hurdle for our nominee will be to overcome the stereotype that Democrats want to take away everyone's guns," said Catherine Crooks, the Democratic Party chairwoman in Franklin County, population 10,124. "That isn't the goal, the goal is responsible gun ownership. It needs to be made quite clear."
Instead of articulating differences on gun control, the candidates are aiming to demonstrate their commitment to the issue through emotional displays.
Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana speaks about losing his 11-year-old nephew to a 1994 school shooting in Butte, Mont. Ms. Gillibrand describes her conversion from an N.R.A.-backed member of Congress to a gun control proponent by talking about meeting with mothers of gun violence victims in Brooklyn after her 2009 appointment to the Senate.
And at the annual Wing Ding dinner Friday night in Clear Lake, Iowa, Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio, who is currently an afterthought in polls, brought the crowd to its feet by recounting a bus trip he took last week to Kentucky, where he protested Senator Mitch McConnell's refusal to hold a vote on legislation that would expand background checks.
"We took the fight to his backyard, telling him that we need gun reform in the United States of America and we need it now. We need it now," Mr. Ryan said. "People are dying on the streets of this country, getting killed by weapons that were made for battlefields, not neighborhoods and places like Dayton, Ohio."
Former Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado, who enacted expanded background checks and limits on the size of ammunition magazines in his state after a 2012 shooting that killed 12 at a movie theater in Aurora, Colo., said the N.R.A. would caricature whoever wins the nomination as a gun-grabber, so Democrats may as well offer an assertive platform.
Mr. Hickenlooper is familiar with the N.R.A.'s influence: It backed a successful recall campaign in 2013 to remove from office two Democratic state senators who voted for the new laws.
"Whoever the Democrat is, the N.R.A. is going to go full hog to beat them," Mr. Hickenlooper said. "The N.R.A. is first and foremost a trade association, and their members need to sell more guns. They're going to push as much money as they can raise against whoever the Democratic candidate is."
Democrats here said the mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton left them focused on finding a candidate who would enact gun control measures -- and concerned for their own safety.
Anthony Atlas, 33, who works for an agriculture technology company in Iowa City, brought his 6-month-old son, Orin, to the state fair Saturday. For the first time, he said, he worried about what would happen if a shooting took place at the fairgrounds.
"I was concerned about going to the state fair," he said. "That's a weird thing to worry about."

Trump: US has better weapons than the 'failed' Russian 'Skyfall' missile

Texto completo: President Trump weighed in on a suspected failed missile explosion in northern Russia, noting U.S. technology is far superior to the "failed" weapon.
The suspected nuclear explosion occurred Thursday off the coast of Russia's Nenoska Missile Test Site, an installation suspected of developing Russia's next generation of advanced missiles. Seven people were reportedly killed.
"The United States is learning much from the failed missile explosion in Russia," Trump tweeted Monday. "We have similar, though more advanced, technology. The Russian 'Skyfall' explosion has people worried about the air around the facility and far beyond. Not good!"
Tweet
Russian media reported radiation briefly spiked to 200 times the normal rate, according to the New York Times, but these reports were later scrubbed from the websites of Severodvinsk, a small city located 25 miles away from the explosion in Russia's Archangel province. Fears over radiation poisoning caused a run on iodine by local residents, which can protect the thyroid gland from absorbing radiation.
Experts and intelligence officials believe the explosion was the result of a botched test of a nuclear-powered cruise missile known by NATO as the SSC-X-9 Skyfall.
"Our working hypothesis is that the event in Russia yesterday was related to Russia's nuclear-powered cruise missile, the 9M730 Burevestnik (NATO name: SSC-X-9 Skyfall," Jeffrey Lewis, an arms control expert at the Middlebury Institute, said Friday on Twitter. "Possibly a botched recovery effort involving the Serebryanka [...]"

The Serebryanka is a Russian nuclear fuel carrier, which an image from Planet Labs shows was near the test site at the time of the incident. The ship was last reported as of Monday in Murmansk, a port 355 miles from Severodvinsk.
Russia is believed to have conducted a partially successful test of the Skyfall on Jan. 29, preceding the Trump administration's announcement removing the U.S. from the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty on Feb. 2. The missile's small nuclear reactor theoretically makes it capable of traveling across the globe for an indefinite amount of time. It is also believed to be capable of avoiding conventional missile defense systems.
This isn't the first incident involving the Skyfall. Russian Navy ships were sent to search for the remains of a Skyfall missile in August after it landed off the coast of northern Russia in March 2018 during a failed test. Putin unveiled the missile that same month, bragging that it renders defense systems "useless." He went on to make a thinly-veiled threat against the U.S.
"I want to tell all those who have fueled the arms race over the last 15 years, sought to win unilateral advantages over Russia, introduced unlawful sanctions aimed to contain our country's development ... you have failed to contain Russia," he said.
"Nobody listened to us. Well listen to us now."

Texto completo: Bernie Sanders is still the favorite among presidential campaign donors in Champaign-Urbana, according to the website Political MoneyLine.

The Vermont senator raised nearly $8,000 from 14 donors in Champaign-Urbana through June 30, more than three times as much as the second-place aspirant, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. She's raised $2,440 locally from seven donors. In third place is South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg with $1,993 from eight donors.

Further down the list are the current national polling leaders for both parties. President Donald Trump has raised just $673 in Champaign-Urbana in this election cycle and former Vice President Joe Biden has brought in a mere $40.

Other candidates receiving contributions from Champaign-Urbana residents include Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, $275; former U.S. Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas, $260; California Sen. Kamala Harris, $255; former HUD secretary Julian Castro, $229; author Marianne Williamson, $213; and U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, $200.

Although Trump had only four donors in Champaign-Urbana, an independent, pro-Trump group -- the Committee to Defend the President -- raised another $150. The Republican National Committee collected $1,005. The National Republican Senate Committee raised $991 and the National Republican Congressional Committee raised $1,365.

The Democratic National Committee raised $4,705 in the community. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee raised $4,584 and the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee raised $942.

The presidential fundraising seems to be in line with the presidential primary results in Champaign County in 2016 when Sanders got 66.4 percent of the vote here to Hillary Clinton's 33.2 percent, and Trump finished second in the GOP primary with 29 percent to Sen. Ted Cruz' 37 percent. Trump lost Champaign County to Clinton in the general election, 54.7 percent to 36.4 percent.

Much of the local presidential candidate fundraising was of small amounts, sometimes as little as $1 or $5, through ActBlue, the online fund-raising platform that receives and distributes donations for Democratic candidates. Only a couple donors came close to the maximum allowable contributions -- Allan Axelrod of Urbana and Michelle McKinney of Decatur -- each contributed $2,700 to Sanders.

Presidential fundraising was skimpy in most other area communities. There were just three contributors in Danville who gave a total of $400 to Trump and $127 to Sanders. In Mahomet, one contributor gave $400 to Warren. In Savoy, Harris raised $50 and Trump got $35. In Monticello, three Democrats got all the money: $1,000 to Warren, $116 to Sanders, and $108 to Buttigieg.

New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker got $575 in Charleston, where Warren also got $250 and Buttigieg collected $150. In Mattoon, Trump received donations totalling $512.

Trump's strongest area county was Macon, where he raised $2,202 from 11 donors. Still, he was outraised there by Sanders, who got a total of $3,050 from two donors. Trump won Macon County in 2016 with 56.6 percent to Clinton's 38.5 percent -- nearly the opposite of Champaign County.

Nationally, according to The New York Times, five candidates -- Sanders, Buttigieg, Warren, Harris and Biden -- stand out from among the Democratic candidates. Sanders has raised $36.2 million in the 2020 election cycle, while Buttigieg has received $32.3 million, Warren $25.2 million, Harris $23.8 million and Biden $22 million.

Sanders has about 746,000 individual donors, compared with 421,000 for Warren, 390,000 for Buttigieg, 277,000 for Harris and 256,000 for Biden.

POLITICIZING VIOLENCE MASS SHOOTINGS SHOULD NOT BE MANIPULATED FOR POLITICAL GAIN

Texto completo: There were three killing fields in America last weekend: El Paso, Dayton and Chicago.
You can't help but know that the young man who killed 22 people in El Paso was driven by hatred for immigrants. You may be less aware, though, that the Dayton killer was a leftist, a fan of Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and "antifa." And you may not have heard at all that in Chicago the same weekend, 32 separate shootings left seven dead and 52 injured.
Your relative awareness of these three tragedies is directly tied to where you get your news or which politicians you prefer.
All the weekend's deaths should cause grief. Some have provoked outrage. Some have not. Why not?
It's because not all the grief and outrage we're witnessing are authentic. Some springs from hearts genuinely broken, but some is manufactured by those seeking to further their own agendas. How to tell them apart?
A fair assessment depends, at least in part, on which facts the outraged - whether protesters, politicians or reporters - choose to acknowledge. Selective outrage expressed by those not directly bereaved usually signals disingenuousness.
Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., provides an almost ridiculous case in point. Within hours of the El Paso massacre, Mr. Booker said President Donald Trump "is responsible because he is stoking fears and hatred and bigotry."
Last Monday, the senator, who is running for president, announced a Wednesday speech at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, S.C., where a white supremacist murdered nine black congregants in 2015.
A New Yorker writer (much impressed that Mr. Booker, off stage, "allows himself to be sombre [sic], sad, even") asked the candidate what he planned to say at the sudden event. Mr. Booker's reply? "It can't just be easy political speak, where you're pointing fingers of blame."
In Wednesday's speech, Mr. Booker focused on white supremacy. It "allows politicians to promise to 'build the wall,'" he said, thus pointing no fingers.
One problem with his thinking -which could just be clouded by grief - is that white supremacy didn't cause the killings in Dayton or in Chicago. The Dayton shooter was a white leftist; half his victims were nonwhite. Chicago's crime was, and is, overwhelmingly black-on-black. These victims - do their lives matter?
In disregarding certain types of violence, political opportunists demean its victims and undermine the search for effective remedies.
Politicians aren't alone in disrespecting deaths that don't fit the white-supremacy narrative. "Gun violence in Chicago," The New York Times noted in a brief story, "tends to peak during the summer months, when school is out, the temperature is high and residents spend more time outside at social gatherings."
So no worries, then. People mired in such circumstances year-round? Too bad for them. Their plight does not merit our angst. (What disdain!)
But which kind of trauma is worse - sudden violence disrupting an otherwise peaceful life, or constant shooting in the streets of your neighborhood? And who is responsible for which type of deplorable violence?
It is the implacable desire to find fault with Mr. Trump that blinds some politicos and journalists to inconvenient truths. We saw it after Pittsburgh's Tree of Life slayings: Loud voices claimed the president had stoked anti-Semitism, when in fact the murderer was enraged by Mr. Trump's pro-Israel policies.
On Wednesday, the president said, "I'm concerned about the rise of any type of hate. I don't like it. Any type of supremacy, whether it's white supremacy or antifa."
Though we may question how much he dislikes "hate," the president is correct in his moral logic here. The Times faults him, however, saying he was "echo[ing] his 'both sides' comments after the neo-Nazi rallies in Charlottesville in 2017" and thus implying that he is making a false moral equivalency.
But this is a valid moral equivalency. Hatred and violence can arise from almost any ideology. All of it destroys. By ignoring this, Mr. Booker, The Times and their ilk are the ones turning violence into politics as usual.

FROM ACROSS THE ATLANTIC, GULF DIVIDING DEMOCRATS APPEARS TO BE A WIDE ONE

Texto completo: Sara Innamorato wants health care for all. Joe Biden does not. She wants to decriminalize the border and said "welcome" to those immigrants crossing illegally. Mr. Biden said, "It's a crime."
It's hard to believe, but these two people claim to be in the same political party. Ms. Innamorato sits with the Democrats state Legislature. Mr. Biden, the former vice-president, wants to run against President Donald Trump in the 2020 election. If he does so, Ms. Innamorato would have to support him. Imagining herself smiling in front of a "Biden for president poster" leads to a very clear reaction: She breathes a long sigh and said: "It will be really hard"
You could say the Democratic Party prizes a huge variety of opinions. Or you could say: The Democrats are split. Watching the debates of their candidates for the presidential election attacking each other more than Mr. Trump, it seems, that the gulf dividing them is huge. At least that's what it looks like from an European angle, or to be more concrete, from Germany.
Sometimes it clears the vision to take a step back. So looking at the United States through the eyes of a European there arises a thought: Maybe Mr. Biden and Ms. Innamorato shouldn't be in the same party. Maybe a party system, where a voter's choice basically is limited to only two parties, is not adequate anymore for a society getting more diverse and polarized. Catch-it-all parties like the Democrats have a hard time these days, not only in the U.S. But in other countries with a multi-party system like Germany, people have other options. In the U.S. they don't.
It almost seems a little absurd: The U.S. embraces competition and freedom of choice almost like no other nation. In supermarkets people can choose between a hundred different types of toothpaste - but when it comes to politics there are just two options. And this in times where the country and the two major parties are splintered like they haven't been in a long time. How can that work?
Ursula Münch knows both sides of the Atlantic. The political scientist from Germany did research in the U.S., published books on American politics and now is head of a political academy in Munich. At first Ms. Münch does what scientists often do: She warns not to compare apples and oranges. What seems alarming in Germany can be totally fine in the U.S. The system in Germany requires parties to vote united in parliament. In the U.S. the need for congressmen and women of the same party to act conjunct is not as huge. So them being divided must not be as precarious as in Germany, said Ms. Münch. But: Yes, there is reason to worry as "the separation especially in the Democratic Party has never been as extreme as now," she said. She can only think of one time when it was similar: In the 60's, when Democrats from the North and the South almost split over Civil Rights issues. Back then for the first time, the Democrats were divided because of ideology. Now they are again.
Tough compromises
The difficulty with ideological disputes is that compromise is quite hard. Ms. Innamorato, for instance, said about health care for all: "We can't keep doing what we did. It will cost people their lives." How can you compromise on a matter of live and death? The same applies to immigration policy. How can you compromise on questions of human rights? On top of the ideological division comes another one, said Ms. Münch: the division between the Rust Belt and Sun Belt regions. In Germany richer states transfer money to poorer states, so even though the differences are not gone, they are better balanced than in the US where such a system isn't as advanced.
So politics are more divided in the U.S., but the possibilities to reflect these differences in the political system are less. In Germany, it's not unusual that new parties emerge and actually will have a say in politics some day. The best example are the Greens. They formed in 1980, were part of the government in 2011 and now polls show the best results they have ever had.
"In Germany we can copy social milieus better," Ms. Münch said. It's an "advantage," that the Americans seem to find attractive. According to a 2018 voter survey from the Democracy Fund Voter Study Group, 68% of Americans say a third party is needed. It's the highest popularity in 20 years. According to Ms. Münch, this wish will never come true as the constitutional hurdles to change the election system are too high. It seems that Americans have to live with their two-party system and the consequences.
"Either you vote one of the two parties or your vote is for the garbage can. Of course frustration is incredibly high," Ms. Münch said. For her that's one of the reasons why voter participation is so low in the U.S. Frustration also gets fed by the fact that a party like the Democrats can never please everyone. Either the moderates or the liberals will be disappointed. That leads to the infinite compromise. Voters want a clear position. There are few things that annoy people more than a politician that never makes a clear point, but tiptoes around it. At least that's what recent events in Germany imply. One of the main reasons why the popularity of the Greens has skyrocketed is: They speak their mind. That's why liberals like Ms. Innamorato argue against a "middle of the road approach". As a Democratic candidate "it's your job to be a leader, not to be liked and please everyone," she said. Being a supporter of party left-wing candidates like Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., or Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. Political scientist Ms. Münch disagrees.
She said it makes it shake her head thinking of "how Democrats right now just pass by the main orientation of the voters. Nominating a woman from the left wing belonging to the elite is not the smartest thing to challenge Trump." While Ms. Innamorato sees the largest opportunity for the Democrats in the group of non-voters, Ms. Münch said: "Addressing minorities does not help as they often do not vote." Saying this she points to another disadvantage of the US system: There is no real party leader. In Germany every party has a strong figure on the top (of course voted democratically). "That is what the Democrats could need right now. A person in a powerful position in the party preventing them from going further in the wrong direction."
There's another aspect, the two disagree on: Ms.Innamorato still has hope, that the Democrats could overcome their division. She suggests they concentrate on the basic needs of working people like housing or health: Ms. Münch on the other hand said: "What unites the Democrats is their common enemy - Trump." Her vision for the future is not that pleasant: Democrats will polarize even more without Trump, she said, and people could get more and more frustrated not having another option for which to vote.

NYU PROFESSOR TRAPPED IN OWN NICHE WHEN ANALYZING EDUCATION JOHN SEXTON HAS BIG IDEAS ABOUT MODERNIZING UNIVERSITY EDUCATION.

Texto completo: The dustier back shelves of the few bookstores that remain are well-supplied with high-minded books about the ideals that a great university should pursue and about the best ways to foster a fine education. What more can be said? Is there really anything new under the sun? Well, John Sexton thinks so.
Mr. Sexton is an eminent law professor at NYU who formerly served as university president and law school dean. Even more impressively, he's written a New York Times bestseller titled "Baseball as a Road to God." Now, that probably would have been an interesting book to review.
But let's talk education. Mr. Sexton has authored "Standing for Reason: The University in a Dogmatic Age." This slim volume is exquisitely well written. The author plainly is a person of great compassion, humanity and erudition. The work is really three short books.
The first discusses the need for civic (and civil) discourse and the role of the university as a "sacred space" for promoting and protecting such discourse. The second, which uses NYU as Exhibit A, presents the idea of the university as an international, interconnected network of campuses and communities that bring faculty and students together as part of what Mr. Sexton hopes will be "an ecumenical world." The third tackles the issue of access to higher education and the challenges that confront those who hope to broaden university opportunities, not only throughout the nation but across the globe.
Any one of these could be (and has been) the subject of several lengthy books. But Mr. Sexton is trying to knit these points together, and to do so engagingly and economically. On the first subject, tackling dogmatism and the challenges it poses on the college campus, Mr. Sexton is articulate, but ultimately predictable and sufficiently politically correct. He bemoans intolerance, but nonetheless defends - or at least expresses undue gentility or sympathy for - campus speech codes, "safe spaces," and the other types of coddled, entitled nonsense that now proliferate at elite institutions like his.
In the second part of his book, Mr. Sexton rolls out the NYU model, which is an elaborate and massive three-legged stool standing on NYU New York (the main campus) and its two younger sisters : NYU Abu Dhabi and NYU Shanghai. Mr. Sexton is justifiably proud of what he and his colleagues have built and accomplished, literally spanning the globe with high quality institutions offering American university experiences not only to Americans but to people of many nationalities. Left entirely opaque and unknown to the reader is the financial detail behind the inevitably massive investments by Emirati sheikdoms and Chinese government-approved funders.
There is mutual back-scratching, to be sure. It's probably no accident that the UAE and the PRC were picked for these campuses. These governments cannot be mistaken for anything remotely resembling democracies, but they do offer lots and lots of cash, and they are eager for not only the mind-expanding opportunities of an American university but also for the legitimizing and scrubbing potential that such a prestigious affiliation provides.
Wouldn't it be nice to learn more about what the feudal dynastic rulers of the various Emirati clans have to say about admissions, about endowments, about programming, about compromises? Ditto for the Communist Party rulers in China. Hong Kong is not free, and so very, very much less so is Shanghai. This is not at all to doubt the sincerity of Mr. Sexton and his colleagues nor the eagerness of so many faculty and students in the Emirates and China to teach and to learn. But it is to say that a book that aspires to frankness and candor should concede that the venues chosen have challenges all their own.
The last part of Mr. Sexton's book is perhaps the most impressive. Here, he wrestles with the problem of access to a quality university education. He does more than wail about privilege and the lack of it. He presents ideas for addressing the problem of student debt that are interesting, especially along the lines of income-based repayment plans that would scale back student obligations according to realistic percentages of what those students are earning in the years after college.
But here, too, Mr. Sexton is a prisoner of his niche. He defends the insufferable and inexcusable administrative bloat at universities (you know -- the deputy assistant provosts for student life, the associate deans for campus engagement, and the like), partly blaming government reporting and compliance obligations for the proliferation of these generously paid and largely superfluous bureaucracies. And he does not even mention - not even for a moment - the increasingly and outrageously massive (re: multimillion dollar) salary and benefits packages hauled in by the presidents of elite universities: the great big check, the magnificent bennies, the residence, the staff, the wining and dining.
It's good to be King.

Texto completo: The New York Times is reviewing Jonathan Weisman's "poor judgment" on social media after multiple instances in which his actions on Twitter have been called into question.
Following two instances in as many weeks of him facing scrutiny for comments he made on Twitter, the Times announced they are "closely examining what to do" about him "repeatedly displaying[ing] poor judgment on social media," according to Yashar Ali.Jonathan WeismanWeisman, the paper’s deputy Washington editor, came under fire last week for claiming that two congresswomen of color, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, weren't really from the Midwest and that Lloyd Doggett of Texas and John Lewis of Georgia weren't from the Deep South.
He faced backlash, and later deleted the tweet, for implying that they weren't really from the regions they were raised in.
“Saying [Tlaib] and [Omar] are from the Midwest is like saying … [Lewis] from the Deep South. C’mon,” he tweeted in response to a tweet about rising liberal politics in the Midwest.
Weisman's social media usage put the spotlight back on him Wednesday when he pointed out that Justice Democrats, a liberal political action committee, had backed an Ohio primary challenger, "seeking to unseat an African-American Democrat, Joyce Beatty, who represents Columbus.”
But, the challenger, Morgan Harper, responded saying she is "also black," to which the editor said he saw a photo with the endorsement.
Roxane Gay, an author and Times contributor, tweeted: “Any time you think you’re unqualified for a job remember that this guy, telling a black woman she isn’t black because he looked at a picture and can’t see, has one of the most prestigious jobs in America. Shoot your shot.”
Weisman proceeded to email Gay and ask for an "enormous apology," and went as far as to reach out to her publisher for an apology.

In Interview, Warren Calls Trump a White Supremacist

Texto completo: COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa -- Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said on Wednesday night that she believed President Trump was a white supremacist, broadly accusing him of dividing Americans along racial lines and providing direct and tacit support to those who believe white people are superior to other races.
Asked in a brief interview with The New York Times if she thought Mr. Trump was a white supremacist, Ms. Warren responded without hesitation: "Yes."
"He has given aid and comfort to white supremacists," Ms. Warren said during a campaign swing in western Iowa. "He's done the wink and a nod. He has talked about white supremacists as fine people. He's done everything he can to stir up racial conflict and hatred in this country."
[Sign up for our politics newsletter and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race.]
Ms. Warren's comments amounted to one of the starkest condemnations to date from a leading Democratic presidential candidate about Mr. Trump's language toward minorities and immigrants. She spoke hours after former Representative Beto O'Rourke of Texas gave the same assessment of Mr. Trump. Asked by MSNBC if Mr. Trump was a white supremacist, Mr. O'Rourke replied, "He is."
"He's dehumanized or sought to dehumanize those who do not look like or pray like the majority here in this country," Mr. O'Rourke said.
Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, another leading candidate for the Democratic nomination, also believes Mr. Trump is a white supremacist. Mr. Sanders was asked on CNN on Sunday if he believed the president was "a white supremacist or a white nationalist," and Mr. Sanders replied, "I do." A senior campaign official confirmed on Thursday that Mr. Sanders believed Mr. Trump was both.
Mr. Trump has a long history of using race for his own gain, and his time in the White House has been no exception.
After pushing the "birther" lie about President Barack Obama, Mr. Trump began his campaign for the presidency by disparaging Mexican immigrants as rapists and criminals. As president, he sought to bar people from predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States; said there were "very fine people on both sides" of a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va.; and used an obscenity to describe African nations.
He has warned of an "invasion" of migrants at the southern border. And last month, he said that four congresswomen of color should "go back" to the countries they came from; all four are American citizens and only one of the women was born outside the United States.
Mr. Trump has faced condemnations from Democratic presidential candidates in the wake of the mass shooting on Saturday in El Paso. The suspect in the attack is believed to have described it in a manifesto as "a response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas" -- echoing Mr. Trump's language.
In a speech in Iowa on Wednesday, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. argued that Mr. Trump had "fanned the flames of white supremacy in this nation."
Mr. Biden has also called Mr. Trump "openly racist." But when he was asked on CNN earlier this week if he believed Mr. Trump was a white nationalist, Mr. Biden stopped short of saying the president was one.
Another candidate, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, also cast blame on Mr. Trump for encouraging hatred. Mr. Booker made those remarks in a speech at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C., where a white supremacist gunman killed nine people in 2015.
[Read more about the speeches by Mr. Biden and Mr. Booker.]
Mr. Trump contends he is not racist and criticized Democrats in a tweet on Wednesday for their remarks, saying their "new weapon is actually their old weapon, one which they never cease to use when they are down, or run out of facts, RACISM!"
Ms. Warren, for her part, said Mr. Trump was intent on dividing people.
"Donald Trump has a central message," she said. "He says to the American people, if there's anything wrong in your life, blame them -- and 'them' means people who aren't the same color as you, weren't born where you were born, don't worship the same way you do."

Texto completo: Jennifer Weiner Dishes on Her Book, Anti-Semitism
BOOKS
JENNIFER WEINER is a sort of Renaissance woman.
She's the Twitter phenom who live tweets episodes of the dating show The Bachelor.
She's the former journalist at The Philadelphia Inquirer who still lives on the pulse of breaking news.
She's the novelist with 13 published books.
And she's also a 49-year-old Jewish mom, who takes her daughter to Hebrew school at Congregation Rodeph Shalom and worries about anti- Semitism.
Weiner's newest book, Mrs. Everything, was published in June and made The New York Times Best Seller List. The novel chronicles the journeys of two Jewish sisters, from their childhood in 1950s Detroit to adult struggles with love and authenticity. Their yenta-esque mother will strike a chord in Jewish readers, as will the frequent discussions of Judaism, womanhood and morality.
Calling it a "swing-for-thefences book," Weiner said Mrs. Everything "was written in the wake of the 2016 election. There were a lot of things I wanted to say - about women, about discrimination, about male privilege and reproductive rights and what 'making America great again' would actually look like."
Agrande esta imagen.

Born in Louisiana, Weiner attended high school in Connecticut as one of only nine Jews in a class of400. After graduating from Princeton University in 1991, she worked in journalism before finding success as an author. Despite 11 million copies of her books in print, Weiner doesn't consider herself famous.
"The truth is, I hardly ever get recognized when I'm out and about. If it does happen, it happens right after I've had my hair done, which says something about my day-to-day grooming abilities," she joked. "I remember once, very early in my writing life, I was signing books at a Borders in Washington, D.C. I had a whole table full of copies of my books and, as I worked my way through the piles, I could see a woman hovering and staring at me."
Flattered, Weiner said she thought the woman was working up her courage to come over and say hello.
"As she finally approached, I put on my biggest smile and prepared to ask if she wanted a book signed when she said, 'Do you know where the bathroom is?' Of course, I told her."
Weiner's sense of humor has been a valuable coping tool. When she was 16, her father left the family. In 2008, he died of a crack cocaine overdose, something Weiner wrote about in her book of essays Hungry Heart. Even with that tragedy, Weiner speaks fondly of her upbringing.
"I was raised in a Jewish household, with Jewish values," she said. "My parents valued education and creativity."
Weiner's parents also reminded her of the fragility of Jewish safety. She knew "how recently Jewish lives had been lost," she said, referring to the Holocaust and the murder of Jewish Olympians in Munich in 1972.
"We were told that it was our job to repair the broken world, to speak out against injustice and work to end if. I've always embraced my identity as a Jew, and taught my daughters to be proud of their culture and tradition, even in hard times. Maybe especially in hard times."
When asked if being so public about her Jewish faith ever caused her fear, she meditated on the importance of activism.
"Anti-Semitism and xenophobia are both on the rise, and it's frightening. I worry every time I take my daughter to Hebrew school and see the armed guards at the synagogue entrance and know that they're necessary."
She encouraged strength in the wake of that fear.
"Maybe easiest thing to do is hide, or be less open and public about my Jewish identity. But I don't think that fear makes anything better."
Much of the current political discourse, she added, only serves to foster hate.
"Being Jewish makes you an outsider and an observer," she said. "I feel angry and anguished when I hear politicians tell their opponents 'go back to where you came from.' Jews deserve a place in America, and a place in the world - just like African Americans, just like Hispanics, just like immigrants - and at this moment, we are called to stand beside them, to use our voices, our power, our influence, to make this a country where we all can belong." *

Texto completo: The White House just axed a proposal that would have made medicines more affordable for patients living with mental illness. Had the change taken effect, millions of Americans would have found it easier to afford the medicines they need.
I've made it my life's mission to help Americans who are battling mental illnesses.
While serving in the House of Representatives, I authored and cosponsored bills to improve treatment of mental health disorders. And I've continued to advocate for these patients since leaving Congress.
Each year, millions of Americans confront mental illness. Roughly one in six Americans relies on some form of psychiatric medication.
Many patients struggle to afford the medications that keep them healthy. In 2017, nearly half of people battling a mental illness went without treatment, according to the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Almost half of those patients cited cost as the reason.
High out-of-pocket pharmacy bills deserve much of the blame. An analysis published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that when copays for antidepressants double, patients fill 26 percent fewer prescriptions.
The Trump administration's proposed rule would have reduced patients' out-of-pocket costs. Specifically, the rule targeted third-party entities called pharmacy benefit managers.
Insurers hire PBMs to negotiate discounts with pharmaceutical companies. In recent years, PBMs have extracted evergreater price concessions from drug makers. Total rebates grew from less than $70 billion in 2013 to $160 billion in 2018.
PBMs and insurers often use these discounts to reduce premiums. But they rarely use the savings to reduce patients' out-of-pocket costs.
The president's reform would have made it illegal for drug makers to give rebates to PBMs in government programs like Medicare and Medicaid, unless the PBMs and insurers used the rebates to reduce out-of-pocket costs.
This change would have driven down medical expenses for patients with government health insurance. Medicare beneficiaries were expected to save between $14 billion and $25 billion over the next decade.
Unfortunately, now that the Trump administration has withdrawn the rule, these patients will never see those savings.
For too many Americans, high out-of-pocket costs impede access to treatment. Abandoning this helpful reform was the wrong move.

Texto completo: A film documenting the life and work of the late renowned American author, Nobel Prize winner and teacher Toni Morrison will be featured as part of the Cane Fire Film Series at the Acadiana Center for the Arts.
Morrison died Monday at the age of 88.
The screening of "Toni Morrison: The Pieces I Am," set for 7:30 p.m. Monday, is a fundraiser for Festival of Words Cultural Arts Collective, a nonprofit based out of Grand Coteau.
In her works, Morrison broaches subjects of race, America, history and the human condition.
The film discusses her many critically acclaimed works and "reflects on her lifelong deconstruction of the master narrative" that is woven together with a rich collection of art, history, literature and personality, according to an ACA press release.
The documentary offers an "artful and intimate meditation" on Morrison's life, from her childhood in Ohio to book tours with Muhammad Ali. The film features Oprah Winfrey, Angela Davis and Morrison herself.
"Throughout, Morrison is effortlessly graceful, insightful and candid, making this intimate, comprehensive portrait of her life and works an exploration of what it means to be a writer whose stories are so deeply intertwined with often-unrealized national truths," The Sundance Institute wrote on the documentary.
Michael Scott Myers, founder of the Cane Fire Film Series, said he chose the film because it's not something Lafayette would normally get in regular theaters. The Cane Fire Film Series started in 2012 and has shown American independent, foreign, animation and documentary films every second Monday of the month.
"Toni Morrison: The Pieces I Am" premiered at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival, receiving high praise on Rotton Tomatoes with a 97% approval rating, a lower score on IMDb at only six and a half stars and some feedback from New York Times chief film critic A.O. Scott.
Advanced tickets can be purchased at ACA, 101 W. Vermilion St., or online for $10. Tickets can also be purchased the night of at the front desk.

Trump says HE’ll likely commute Blagojevich sentence Commute: ‘I

Texto completo: President Donald Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Wednesday that he is likely to commute former Gov. Rod Blagojevich’s sentence.
Speaking to reporters on Air Force One as they flew back to Washington from El Paso, Texas, the president hinted he was open to giving Blagojevich, 62, a break, the Chicago Sun-Times reported.
Blagojevich has served about half of a 14-year federal prison sentence for corruption that included seeking to sell an appointment to the Senate seat Barack Obama vacated to become president.
"In the last hour of the flight, POTUS came back to the press cabin for a 45-minute off-the-record conversation. He then said the press could put one part on the record — that he is again considering commuting the sentence of former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich," the pool report said.
"I thought he was treated unbelievably unfairly; he was given close to 18 years in prison. And a lot of people thought it was unfair, like a lot of other things — and it was the same gang, the Comey gang and all these sleazebags that did it. And his name is Rod Blagojevich," the president said, misstating Blagojevich’s sentence.
"He’s been in jail for seven years over a phone call where nothing happens — over a phone call which he shouldn’t have said what he said, but it was braggadocio you would say. I would think that there have been many politicians — I’m not one of them, by the way — that have said a lot worse over the telephone."
The New York Times’ Maggic Haberman tweeted that Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, had pushed for a pardon, but aides instead persuaded Trump to agree to commutation.
In June 2018, Trump broached the possibility of freeing Blagojevich, suggesting the one-time "Celebrity Apprentice" contestant was convicted for "being stupid."
Wife Patti Blagojevich has waged a focused campaign — primarily in FOX News appearances and through social media — to appeal to Trump for clemency, the Sun-Times reported.
"His wife I think is fantastic, and I’m thinking about commuting his sentence very strongly. I think it’s enough, seven years," Trump said.
Contacted by a Sun-Times reporter late Wednesday, Patti Blagojevich was surprised to hear of the president’s comments but declined to comment.
The pool report did not mention why Trump wanted to discuss Blagojevich.
Blagojevich is scheduled to be released on May 23, 2024. He currently is serving his sentence in an Englewood, Colorado, facility.
In 2018, Trump first dangled the potential of helping Blagojevich. That prompted seven Republican House members from Illinois to urge the president not to commute the sentence after Trump raised the possibility of a clemency for the man he got to know on "The Celebrity Apprentice" in 2010.
Rep. Darin LaHood, R-Ill., organized the letter, which asked Trump, to "give thoughtful attention to our fear that granting clemency for the former governor would set a detrimental precedent and send a damaging message on your efforts to root out public corruption in our government."
In addition to trying to sell Obama’s Senate seat, Blagojevich was convicted of attempting to, among other counts, trying to shake down the CEO of Children’s Memorial Hospital for $25,000 in campaign contributions and threatening to hold up a bill to benefit the racetrack industry for $100,000 in campaign contributions.
The CEO of what was then called Edward Hospital in Naperville, Pam Davis, is credited with helping blow the whistle on Blagojevich. She wore a wire to record conversations with Blagojevich cronies trying to shake her organization down as the hospital tried for years to build a second hospital in Plainfield but was denied repeatedly from the Illinois Health Facilities Planning Board.

Trump's Approval Rating Is Rising. Will It Matter?

Texto completo: Donald J. Trump doesn't always seem like a candidate focused on expanding his base of support. He may have done so anyway.
The share of Americans who say they have a favorable view of him has increased significantly since the 2016 election.
And over the last few months, some of the highest-quality public opinion polls, though not all, showed the president's job approval rating -- a different measure from personal favorability -- had inched up to essentially match the highest level of his term.
The increase in his support since 2016, and the possibility that it continues to move higher, does not necessarily make him a favorite to win re-election. His job approval ratings remain well beneath 50 percent, and have never eclipsed it. But the rise has some important implications in how to view his re-election prospects.
One common view of the 2020 election, for instance, takes 2016 as a starting point. It notes that Democrats fell just short of victory, and that therefore any number of changes -- a better candidate, higher black turnout, and so on -- would be enough to win the election in 2020. This way of thinking assumes that the president's support would remain unchanged -- that he could do little to match incremental increases in Democratic turnout or support, compared with 2016.
But it is not 2016 anymore. Millions of Americans who did not like the president in 2016 now say they do. Over all, his personal favorability rating has increased by about 10 percentage points among registered voters since Election Day 2016, to 44 percent from 34 percent, according to Upshot estimates.
Some of these voters probably voted for Mr. Trump in 2016, even though they didn't like him at the time. But some probably did not vote for him: Republicans with an unfavorable opinion of Mr. Trump were more than twice as likely to stay home on Election Day as those with a favorable view, according to New York Times/Siena surveys of North Carolina, Florida and Pennsylvania in 2016.
It seems likely that a substantial number of these voters now have a favorable view of the president: Over all, 28 percent of Republican-leaning voters with an unfavorable view of Mr. Trump in 2016 had a favorable view of him by 2018, according to data from the Voter Study Group. The aggregate national data suggests that Mr. Trump has gained more support than that -- if not from Republicans then perhaps from some number of independents or former Democrats.
Of course, Democrats might benefit from a more popular candidate than they had in 2016. Hillary Clinton was an unusually unpopular candidate, surpassed only by Mr. Trump in this regard in the modern era of polling. But an analysis that freezes the president's standing in 2016 but assumes an improvement for the Democratic nominee would be misleading.
At the same time, there are signs that Mr. Trump's job approval ratings have continued to improve over the first half of the year, since the conclusion of the government shutdown. (In assessing his prospects for 2020, job approval numbers are more meaningful than those for favorability.)
In some periods over the last few months, his job approval rating increased to among the highest levels of his term, according to live-interview telephone polls, long considered the gold standard of public opinion research. In live-interview polls of registered voters since June, Mr. Trump's job approval rating has averaged 46.4 percent, higher than his 45.9 percent vote share in 2016. (This analysis excludes those respondents who did not offer an opinion about the president.) Curiously, online polls have not shown this same increase; in fact, they've shown no increase at all.
As a result, Mr. Trump's approval rating is now higher in live-interview telephone polls than in online surveys, reversing a trend that dates to the very first days of his campaign. The president's longstanding relative strength in online polls led many to speculate about a "shy" or "hidden" Trump vote that would divulge its preferences only online -- not in live interviews. There was never much evidence for this theory, but if a "shy" Trump vote ever existed, it has either subsided or been canceled out by some newer series of biases in online polls.
The differences seen in the two types of polling are fairly small, a matter of a couple of points. The gap is small enough that it could fade, perhaps even imminently. And his support seems to have fallen a bit in the last month, perhaps because of a series of comments attacking Democratic members of Congress, including telling some of them to go back to the countries they came from. His support could fall further with worsening economic news and in the aftermath of the mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton, Ohio.
It's true that the president's job approval rating has been unusually stable when compared with other presidents. But the possibility that he has lifted his ratings, however fleetingly, to match the highest levels of his presidency is a reminder that the ceiling on his support is higher than some may think. There are any number of forces that might knock him back, like a weakening economy, or hold him back, including his conduct on social media. But there's no reason he's limited to the support or turnout he had in 2016.

Texto completo: Suit against Boy Scouts says new abuse claims uncovered
Lawyers bringing a lawsuit against the Boy Scouts of America said Tuesday they believe they've turned up allegations of sexual abuse against more than 350 people not previously identified in files released by the organization.
Attorneys with the Abused in Scouting group filed a lawsuit Monday in Philadelphia Common Pleas Court, alleging a one-time scout leader sexually abused a minor identified only by initials.
The suit alleges that the abuse of the then-12- or 13-year-old victim by an assistant scout leader began in 1974 or 1975 and continued until about 1980.
It also says that the lawyers received allegations of abuse from their clients against more than 350 people involved with the scouts who had not previously been named.
The Irving, Texas-based scouts compiled so-called ineligible volunteer files for years on people considered to pose a risk of abuse, and about 5,000 of these files have been made public as a result of court action.
Monday's suit is claiming that the lawyers now have hundreds of names that were not in those public files. It does not list the names.
An email message seeking comment was sent to the Boy Scouts.
The lawsuit comes as states have begun changing their statutes of limitations to make it easier for long-ago victims of sexual assault can seek damages in court.
The Boy Scouts have said previously that when any volunteer is added to the database for suspected abuse, "they are reported to law enforcement, removed entirely from any Scouting and prohibited from rejoining anywhere."

China vows to counter if US places midrange arms in Asia
BEIJING -- China said Tuesday that it "will not stand idly by" and will take countermeasures if the U.S. deploys intermediate-range missiles in the Asia-Pacific region, which Washington has said it plans to do within months.
The statement from the director of the Foreign Ministry's Arms Control Department, Fu Cong, follows the U.S. withdrawal last week from the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty, a move Fu said would have a "direct negative impact on the global strategic stability" as well as security in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region.
Fu also advised other nations, particularly South Korea, Japan and Australia, to "exercise prudence" and not allow the United States to deploy such weapons on their territory, saying that would "not serve the national security interests of these countries."

Court allows Palin's lawsuit against NY Times to proceed
NEW YORK -- The New York Times Co. must face a defamation lawsuit by former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin over a 2017 editorial that linked her to the 2011 shooting of Sen. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., a federal appeals court said.
The ruling is a win for the 2008 Republican vice presidential candidate, though the court said the bar remains high for Palin ultimately to prevail in the case.
The 21-page decision, which reinstated a lawsuit dismissed by a lower-court judge, is largely procedural, with the New York-based appeals court saying Palin's complaint "plausibly states a claim for defamation."
But it now allows her lawyers to obtain documents from The New York Times Co. and also question editorial page editor James Bennet.

Peter Strzok sues FBI for firing him over anti-Trump texts
WASHINGTON -- A veteran FBI agent who wrote derogatory text messages about Donald Trump filed a lawsuit Tuesday charging the bureau caved to "unrelenting pressure" from the president when it fired him.
The suit from Peter Strzok also alleges he was unfairly punished for expressing his political opinions, and that the Justice Department violated his privacy when it shared hundreds of his text messages with reporters.
"This campaign to publicly vilify Special Agent Strzok contributed to the FBI's ultimate decision to unlawfully terminate him," the lawsuit says.
The complaint revisits a political drama that was seized on by conservative critics of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation as proof that the bureau was biased against Trump.

US envoy to Russia Jon Huntsman to resign post
WASHINGTON -- Jon Huntsman, the U.S. ambassador to Russia, is resigning from the diplomatic post he has held for almost two years, a period marked by growing confrontation and friction between Moscow and Washington.
In a resignation letter sent Tuesday to President Donald Trump, Huntsman characterized his tenure as a "historically difficult" time in bilateral relations. He will depart Oct. 3.
Huntsman had resigned during his second term as Utah governor in 2009 and became the U.S. ambassador to China under the Obama administration. He left that post two years later for an unsuccessful run for president. When he became ambassador to Moscow, he said he would take the job for two years.
In his resignation letter Huntsman, 59, said he wanted to return "to reconnect with our growing family and responsibilities."

Trump, RNC challenge California law on tax returns
WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump and the Republican National Committee filed two lawsuits Tuesday against California officials, challenging a new law that would bar Trump from appearing on the state's primary ballot next year if he declines to disclose his tax returns.
The federal lawsuits, which were threatened last week when Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed the bill into law, argue that the measure requiring presidential and gubernatorial candidates to release five years of tax returns runs afoul of the U.S. Constitution.
Newsom responded on Twitter to the lawsuits filed in U.S. District Court in Sacramento: "There's an easy fix Mr. President -- release your tax returns as you promised during the campaign and follow the precedent of every president since 1973."

In Britain: A youth court in London ordered a teenager held on an attempted murder charge Tuesday for allegedly throwing a 6-year-old boy from a viewing area at the top of the British capital's Tate Modern museum.
The French boy was a short distance from his parents Sunday when he was picked up and thrown over the railing of the 10th-floor observation deck.
The police said other museum visitors stopped a 17-year-old British citizen from leaving until officers arrived, and that the two boys had no prior connection.
The 6-year-old is hospitalized in critical but stable condition with a sustained brain bleed and fractures to his spine, legs and arms.

Texto completo: After two mass shootings tore our nation apart over the weekend, President Donald Trump, Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney took up a series of familiar refrains: The problem is mental health. Or movies. Or video games. Or social media. But we know better than these National Rifle Association talking points. Our nation's gun violence crisis is caused by easy access to guns.
American video games and movies are distributed - and loved - around the world. Every country grapples with how to treat mental illness. But only in the United States is our gun homicide rate 25 times the average of other high-income countries.
Some, like Mr. Mulvaney, who said that "you cannot be a white supremacist and be normal in the head," say that the alleged El Paso, Texas, shooter, who appears to have posted an anti-immigration manifesto, was mentally ill.
But white supremacy is not a mental illness. It's an ideology encouraged by the president and too many of our nation's leaders, and combined with our nation's lax gun laws, it's deadly.
This past weekend, nearly 2,000 Moms Demand Action and Students Demand Action volunteer leaders - 700 of whom are gun violence survivors - were in Washington for our annual training conference as we continue our fight for sensible gun laws. People came in from all 50 states and the District of Columbia to celebrate their wins and learn from one another.
As we gathered for lunch on Saturday, our volunteers heard reports of an active shooter in El Paso. Our Texas volunteers rushed out of the room to be together and check on loved ones. Soon, the worst was confirmed. That night, when we typically host a gala to reward volunteers for their hard work, hundreds of volunteers instead headed to the White House to hold a vigil and demand that our Senate and president do their jobs and put an end to our gun violence crisis.
The next morning, we woke to news of yet another mass shooting - this time in Dayton, Ohio, where nine people were shot and killed and more than 20 were wounded.
And these were only the shootings that made national headlines. Also over the weekend, 46 people were shot in Chicago, seven fatally. And in recent weeks, gun violence has devastated communities in Baltimore; Gilroy, Calif.; Los Angeles; Virginia Beach, Va.; and Brooklyn.
This isn't just about school shootings or mass shootings. It's about the fact that there isn't a parent left in the United States who doesn't fear that their child could be next, and that there is no place any American, of any age, can count on being safe. It's about Americans having to stand up to gunmen because leaders in the Senate and White House won't stand up for us.
Gun violence kills 100 Americans every day. This is a public health crisis that demands urgent action.
The American people don't need convincing: 93% of Americans want background checks for all gun buyers, including 87% of gun owners and 89% of Republicans. Yet we haven't even passed the most basic of federal gun laws - like requiring a background check on all gun sales or passing a red-flag law.
Some lawmakers say that this legislation won't prevent massacres like the ones we saw this past weekend, but states with background checks on all gun sales see fewer gun homicides.
Senators may be taking an unearned vacation, but we aren't. So starting today, Moms Demand Action and Students Demand Action will unleash the full power of our grassroots movements to pressure senators to listen to Americans, and to pass a law to require background checks on all gun sales and strong federal red-flag legislation.
And if senators don't care that communities are being devastated by a crisis they helped create, they might care about political reality.
In the midterm elections, gun safety advocates helped flip seven statehouses and give the House of Representatives a gun-sense majority. The political calculus on gun safety changed. Democratic presidential candidates are speaking out on the debate stage and at town halls, and, for the first time, they're competing to be the strongest on gun safety. All of this is happening because Americans are fed up and terrified.
Acts of gun violence are not acts of God. It's time for our elected leaders to finally listen to the vast majority of Americans instead of a vocal minority of gun extremists. Pass laws at the federal level that we've seen save lives in the states where they've been enacted. Stop playing politics and serving us platitudes. It's time to do your jobs.
Shannon Watts is the founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. She wrote this for The Washington Post.

Mini shampoo bottles may join plastic straws

Texto completo: Now that the hotel industry has largely embraced bans on plastic straws, one major hotel group aims to eliminate the next set of plastic targets: mini bottles of shampoo, conditioner, lotion and the like.
IHG announced last week that it planned to replace all "bathroom miniatures" with bulk supplies across all of its 17 brands, including Holiday Inn Hotels and Resorts and Intercontinental Hotels & Resorts. The decision will affect 843,000 guest rooms in more than 5,600 hotels during 2021.
"Today's customers and colleagues expect us to have less impact on the environment," said Keith Barr, chief executive of IHG. He called the company's plastic straw ban, which was announced in October 2018, a first step in a wider sustainability program. "This, to me, was the next logical step."
While IHG is the first company to issue the brand-wide ban, many hotels already use refillable dispensers of personal care products, often associated with affordable hotels, rather than single-use items.
"Budget hotels have always been more likely to have bulk shampoo and conditioner dispensers in the shower, and some also have them by the sink. The reason is cost," said Henry H. Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst and president of Atmosphere Research Group. "It costs them less to install and service these bulk dispensers than providing individual cakes of soap and bottles of shampoo, conditioner and the like."
Barr acknowledged the savings in costs to hotel operations, but framed it as a win-win that "makes environmental and commercial sense," he said.
The hurdle may be convincing an Intercontinental guest to accept a bulk dispenser in the bath as better than the mini bottle of high-end shampoo. Some luxury travel companies have been moving in that direction.
The luxury cruise line Lindblad Expeditions uses refillable dispensers for soap, shampoo and other liquid products on all of its ships, including the upcoming National Geographic Endurance, launching in April 2020. The Waldorf Astoria Maldives Ithaafushi, which opened July 1, offers Salvatore Ferragamo bathroom amenities in refillable marble containers. In Namibia, andBeyond Sossusvlei Desert Lodge, opening in October, plans to put bath products in bulk glass bottles.
Several IHG brands already offer bulk bathroom amenities, including the high-end Six Senses Hotels Resorts Spas, which IHG acquired earlier this year, where bathrooms are fitted with refillable ceramic dispensers. It also furnishes bathroom products in bulk at its wellness-centered Even, mid-scale Avid and new upscale Voco hotels.
The mini bottle ban is the latest salvo in an escalating battle against plastic waste. Municipalities and companies are making moves - like San Francisco's initiative to ban the sale of plastic water bottles on city property and IKEA's commitment to ditch single-use plastic plates, cups and cutlery in its houseware lines and in-store cafes.
In the travel industry, major hotel groups, including Marriott International and Hilton, have pledged to rid their properties of plastic straws. Airlines including American, Delta and United have done the same in their airplanes.
Following IHG's move to ban personal products in mini plastic bottles, others may be forced to follow. The California Legislature is currently considering Assembly Bill 1162, which would prohibit hotels, beginning in 2023, from providing miniature plastic bottles of personal care products.
According to the World Bank, some 242 million tons of plastic waste was produced in 2016 and this waste is projected to grow to 3.4 billion tons in 2050. The World Economic Forum found at least 8 million tons of plastics end up in the ocean annually, and that only 14% of plastic packaging material globally is collected for recycling.
To Barr, the green swap is worth any disappointment on the part of travelers who may miss taking home their freebie bottles of Agraria shampoo from an Intercontinental resort or Beekman 1802 lotion from a Crowne Plaza hotel.
"I'm sure I will get some emails from some customers, but I'm betting I'll get more thank you's for taking a step forward and having a positive effect on the environment," he said.

Texto completo: CNN contributor Wajahat Ali deleted a tweet supporting the hashtag 'MassacreMoscowMitch' in reference to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
"#MassacreMoscowMitch is trending. I still have faith in America," Ali, who also writes op-eds for the New York Times, said Monday on Twitter.
He later explained why he deleted the tweet, stating that critics were acting in "bad faith" for suggesting Ali supported violence against McConnell.
"This hashtag trended bc people called out Mitch McConnell for his refusal to let the Senate vote on gun control and election security bills. The right wing knows it but in bad faith are trying to 'both sides' & shame. In good faith I deleted it but they're not fooling anyone."
Tweet"Bad faith right wing trolls, many with blue checkmarks, are out today. They're hungry and desperate. Anything to deflect from gun control, white supremacist terrorism or talking about Trump and their enabling of his racism. Don't let them rattle you. Keep moving forward," Ali added.Tweet
The hashtag "MassacreMoscowMitch" trended on Twitter Monday with thousands of people on social media using the hashtag including a California congressman.
TweetTweetTweet
The hashtag trended as critics of the Kentucky Republican claimed he wanted to shutdown debate on gun control measures.
McConnell, 77, fractured his shoulder Sunday in a fall in his Louisville home.

Earlier this month, Ali was part of a segment on CNN in which he and another contributor accused each other of racism before CNN host Anderson Cooper cut the segment to commercials.

Attacking the media is bad — until Democrats see a headline they dislike

Texto completo: Attacks against the free press are dangerous and undemocratic — except for when they are not.
As it turns out, Democrats' support for the news media is conditional. They will defend the press so long as it benefits their party and it is against a mutual enemy. But if a news organization runs afoul of the Democratic agenda, you better believe all bets are off.
On Monday, President Trump addressed two mass shooting events from this weekend. He condemned "grisly video games" and white nationalism, calling also for unity.
In response, the New York Times ran the following headline for its print edition: "TRUMP URGES UNITY VS. RACISM." A photo of a memorial erected at the site of one of the mass shootings accompanied the headline.
Democratic lawmakers and 2020 primary candidates were furious over the newspaper's word choice. Many demanded the New York Times amend the headline. Others claimed the newspaper had fallen down on the job. Some even accused the New York Times of aiding the rise of white supremacy.
"Unbelievable," said former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke.
Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey added, "Lives literally depend on you doing better, NYT. Please do."
"That’s not what happened," stated Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York.
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio added, "Hey, [New York Times] — what happened to 'The Truth Is Worth It?' Not the truth. Not worth it."
"Let this front page serve as a reminder of how white supremacy is aided by - and often relies upon - the cowardice of mainstream institutions," said New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
The New York Times, of course, caved to peer pressure. Because if there is one thing national newsrooms cannot withstand, it is blue-on-blue action.
“The headline was bad and has been changed for the second edition,” a spokesperson for the Times told the Washington Post.
The amended headline now reads: "ASSAILING HATE BUT NOT GUNS."
So brave. So free. All that chest-puffing against Trump. All those years standing arms akimbo and stating, "We are not fake news, Mr. President." All that posturing, and the New York Times folded like a cheap suit in the face of Democratic criticism. It sure is fun watching the same newspaper that pretends to speak truth to power ask "how high?" when members of one of the two major parties say "jump."
As for the Democrats: Nicely done.
For the last three years, they have said that attacks against the press are attacks on democracy. Yet, many wasted no time this week torching the New York Times for a headline they did not like. They pressured it into changing its coverage to better suit the Democratic perspective! Democrats went from "#PressFreedom" to "You are fake news!" at the drop of a hat, and all because of a headline.
If I did not know any better, I would say these people do not actually care about press freedom. They care only about having a working megaphone with which to defeat their opponents.

Appeals court brings back Sarah Palin defamation lawsuit against the New York Times

Texto completo: Former Republican Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin has another shot at suing the New York Times after an appeals court reversed a lower court opinion dismissing her defamation case against the newspaper.
Appeals court Judge John M. Walker Jr. ruled Tuesday that the district court judge in the case “erred in relying on acts outside the pleadings to dismiss the complaint,” adding that the amended complaint “plausibly states a claim for defamation and may proceed to full discovery.”
Palin, 55, had filed the lawsuit in June 2017 in response to an editorial that drew a link between the shooting of former Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and a map of crosshairs over Democratic congressional districts that her political action committee SarahPAC had circulated. In 2011, the 49-year-old Democrat was shot in the head by a gunman during an assassination attempt in Tucson, Arizona.
The Times editorial was published in the wake of the 2017 congressional baseball practice shooting that injured six, including Republican Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise. When reflecting upon the Giffords shooting and the PAC map, the initial editorial concluded that the “link to political incitement was clear.”
The Times issued a correction the following day that backed off of its previous assertion.
“An earlier version of this editorial incorrectly stated that a link existed between political incitement and the 2011 shooting of Representative Gabby Giffords. In fact, no such link was established,” the correction read. Regardless, Palin decided to file a defamation lawsuit in the Southern District of New York over the matter.
Judge Jed Rakoff had ruled in August 2017 that the case be dismissed, writing, “Negligence this may be; but defamation of a public figure it plainly is not.”
After Tuesday’s reversal, Libby Locke and Ken Turkel, Palin’s attorneys in the case, issued a statement noting that the lawsuit was about holding the media accountable.
“This is — and has always been — a case about media accountability. We are pleased with the Court's decision, and we look forward to starting discovery and ultimately proceeding to trial,” the statement read.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — The more we learn, the more Jeffrey Epstein resembles an evil comic book character for the developmentally arrested intellectual — the charming-but-lurid mastermind with a plot to take over the world by impregnating scores of women on a remote desert estate.
Last Wednesday, The New York Times reported that the financier/​convicted sex offender/​philanthropist — and now accused sex trafficker — is also a “transhumanist,” who had big plans for humankind. Epstein apparently told one scientist that he hoped to seed the human race with his own DNA by impregnating 20 women at a time at his New Mexico ranch, named “Zorro.”
Transhumanism is the theory that the human population can be enhanced through technologies such as artificial intelligence and genetic engineering. Or eugenics by any other name. Epstein seems to have believed that he was that rare breed that ought to be replicated.
The carriers of Epstein’s apparently rarefied spermatozoa wouldn’t be the younger, underage sexual partners he allegedly prefers. Instead, according to the Times’ reporting, his maternal vehicles would be adult women whose intellectual qualifications would have been established through academic achievement.
For salon dinners he hosted at his Manhattan manse, Epstein often invited scientists as well as a sampling of attractive, accomplished women. Some of the scientists theorized that the women were being vetted as potential candidates for Epstein’s very special black book, according to the Times.
One can only imagine the conversations at such soirees: So, Penelope, what do you think of transhumanism? Oh, you do? And how do you like the desert air?
The male invitees weren’t your run-of-the-mill scientists but were some of the most renowned, innovative minds in research and academia. Among them was Steven Pinker, the Harvard cognitive psychologist and popular science author, who seems to have seen through Epstein, calling him an “intellectual imposter.” Pinker told the Times that Epstein would abruptly shift topics and make juvenile remarks. To the layman’s eye, such behavior suggests a purposeful deflection when the topic at hand is reaching a point beyond the speaker’s comfort range.
Others on Epstein’s guest lists apparently were seduced by his charm and intellect, as well as his wealth, which he reportedly dangled as bait for funding-starved researchers. He was generous, often donating to a variety of interests and causes, including the Clinton Foundation. But he wasn’t convinced that helping the starving masses was productive in the right sense, arguing that providing food and health care to the poor would only heighten the risk of overpopulation.
Pinker, who said he was present when Epstein floated this idea at a gathering at Harvard, dissented, arguing that the evidence points to the contrary. Gods don’t like to be contradicted and Pinker was thereafter told he’d been “voted off the island” and banished from future gatherings.
Speaking of which, Epstein’s private island in the Caribbean — which he dubs “Little St. Jeff’s” — is of renewed interest thanks to an NBC News report last week. Apparently, a blue-and-white striped, block-shaped building on it bears no resemblance to the octagonally shaped design that had been approved for a music hall, according to permit records.
What the structure does resemble, however, is a pharaoh’s headdress. Might this have been intended as a mausoleum for Epstein’s remains? That is, other than his head and penis, which he reportedly wished to have frozen. Also a fan of cryogenics, believing that frozen human parts and bodies could be resurrected in the future, Epstein is no ordinary bloke. Indeed, he is a perversely tragic figure.
Burdened with supra-human fantasies and the means to explore them, it seems that Epstein became lost in his own fable. Wandering the skies in his private jet, enamored of his own mind and image, he forgot that he was merely mortal and may have flown too close to the sun. Confined now to a jail cell (with further punishment perhaps to come) — and removed from his luxurious kingdom, his freedom and the company of luminaries who suffused his ego with admiration — his suffering must be immense.
And so richly deserved.

¿Por qué acusan a la publicidad de Trump en Facebook de estar ligada a la masacre en El Paso?

Texto completo: Un nuevo reporte deja en evidencia la relación entre la retórica que maneja el presidente Donald Trump y las palabras del asesino de El Paso consignadas en el manifesto que dejó antes del tiroteo.
La investigación de The Hill concluyó que la campaña del presidente Trump ha colocado miles de anuncios en Facebook desde enero de este año advirtiendo de una “invasión” en la frontera sur de Estados Unidos.
Los más de 2000 anuncios se publicaron entre enero y mayo y muestran cómo la campaña del presidente se ha aprovechado de un lenguaje que los críticos califican de racista y xenófobo para obtener apoyo político.
“La crisis en la frontera sur es aún peor de lo que la mayoría entiende”, dice un anuncio, publicado por primera vez en enero.
“Hice MÚLTIPLES viajes a la frontera para mostrar la verdadera invasión que ocurre, pero los demócratas y los medios de comunicación falsos simplemente no me escuchan” .
El uso de la palabra “invasión”, ha sido objeto de duras críticas en los últimos días después de que apareció en un manifiesto escrito por el asesino de El Paso, Texas. Patrick Crusius supuestamente escribió que el ataque, que mató a 22 personas, fue una respuesta a una “invasión hispana de Texas”.
El uso repetido de la campaña de Trump de la palabra “invasión” en los anuncios de Facebook fue informado por primera vez por The New York Times el lunes.
Otro anuncio de la campaña de Trump, publicado por primera vez en Facebook en febrero, acusa a los demócratas de no negociar de buena fe la financiación del muro fronterizo propuesto por el presidente, diciendo que “LA OBSTRUCCIÓN es mucho más importante para ellos que SU SEGURIDAD”.
“¡Tenemos una INVASIÓN! Entonces estamos CONSTRUYENDO EL MURO para DETENERLO. Los demócratas nos demandarán. ¡Pero queremos un PAÍS SEGURO! ”, Dice el anuncio.
La campaña de Trump ha invertido millones de dólares en publicidad digital, particularmente en Facebook, y los datos del sitio de redes sociales muestran que los anuncios que usan la palabra “invasión” representan solo una pequeña fracción del total de anuncios comprados por la campaña, reportó The Hill.
Según datos de la firma digital demócrata Bully Pulpit Interactive entre el 5 de enero y el 27 de julio, la campaña gastó $8.7 millones en publicidad en Facebook
Además de los anuncios de Facebook, Trump ha mencionado repetidamente una llamada invasión en la frontera sur durante manifestaciones de campaña y en Twitter.

Texto completo: Los autos sin conductor han llegado a la ciudad de Nueva York, finalmente .
Para debutar, los autos han sido situados detrás de las puertas del extenso Brooklyn Navy Yard , lejos de las calles de la ciudad repletas de autos, bicicletas y peatones.
Los automóviles comenzarán a transportar personas el miércoles alrededor de un circuito , un centro de fabricación y tecnología operado de forma privada.
Correrán los siete días de la semana para atender a los pasajeros que se dirigen hacia y desde un embarcadero recientemente inaugurado. No hay cargo por un viaje y cualquiera puede subir, reportó The New York Times.
La Corporación de Desarrollo de Brooklyn Navy Yard se asoció con Optimus Ride para la iniciativa, que incluye seis vehículos autónomos (también conocidos como AV).
Los vehículos autónomos han sido anunciados como la próxima revolución en el transporte, prometiendo mover personas y bienes de manera mucho más eficiente que los automóviles que dependen de personas detrás del volante.
Los defensores argumentan que la tecnología de conducción autónoma se puede aprovechar para aumentar la confianza y seguridad de los taxis, Ubers y autobuses, así como para hacer entregas de camiones y operar maquinaria de construcción.
También dicen que puede reducir la necesidad de autos personales y espacios de estacionamiento en ciudades congestionadas.
Pero parte de este entusiasmo desapareció después de que una mujer que andaba en bicicleta en una calle de Tempe, Arizona, fuera golpeada fatalmente el año pasado por un automóvil sin conductor que estaba siendo probado por Uber.
Fue la primera muerte peatonal conocida que involucró a un vehículo autónomo, aunque tres conductores de Tesla también murieron en los últimos años en choques que ocurrieron después de que se activó un sistema de asistencia automática al conductor.
También han sido criticados los autos autónomos que dependen del gas por el efecto invernadero que contribuyen al cambio climático.
Aún así, los vehículos autónomos continúan siendo probados en más de una docena de comunidades en todo el país , según Samuel I. Schwartz, consultor de transporte.
Añadió que casi todos estos autos autónomos están confinados a áreas cerradas, aunque algunos han operado de forma limitada en vías públicas.
Driverless cars have rolled into New York City. But don’t expect to see them traveling down Fifth Avenue anytime soon. https://t.co/RsTKwzjRbM

8chan down after El Paso mass shooting — for now

Texto completo: After several hours of downtime, 8chan, the online message board that appears to have been used by the suspect in the El Paso mass shooting to post an anti-immigrant manifesto, was again accessible for a few hours Monday, then back down again.
“8chan is coming back online around the world,” a message on the site read as of 10 a.m. Pacific time. “Shout out to our team working hard in the background to restore services.”
Sunday night, 8chan said on its Twitter account that it would be down for the next 24 to 48 hours after Cloudflare dropped it as a customer. San Francisco-based Cloudflare provides support against denial-of-service attacks on websites, so its move opened up 8chan to attacks that could take the site offline.
Calling 8chan a “cesspool of hate,” Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince said in a blog post: “The rationale is simple: they have proven themselves to be lawless and that lawlessness has caused multiple tragic deaths.”
The suspect in Saturday’s El Paso shooting that killed 22 people and injured more than 20 others, 21-year-old Patrick Crusius, is believed to have posted on 8chan a screed titled “The Inconvenient Truth,” in which he rails against immigrants and said the rampage was meant as a response to an “invasion” of Hispanics into Texas. The writing praises the suspect in another mass shooting who posted an anti-Muslim manifesto on 8chan: the man who carried out the attacks at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand in March, which killed 51 people.
The suspect in the Poway synagogue shooting in April, in which one person died and three people were injured, is also believed to have posted a manifesto on 8chan in which he complained about Jewish people.
“What these killers want to do is inspire the next, and 8chan is the place to do that,” said Oren Segal, director of the Center on Extremism at ADL, in an interview Monday.
Segal said he wasn’t surprised that 8chan was back up, and that it would be tough to keep it or similar platforms offline for long. He cited the Daily Stormer, a white supremacist website, and Gab, a far-right social network, as examples of extremist sites that have persisted online despite running into technical obstacles.
“The reality is that there is a market for this hate and extremism online,” he said.
Prince, the CEO of Cloudflare, said as much in his blog post: “While removing 8chan from our network takes heat off of us, it does nothing to address why hateful sites fester online.”
There were reports that 8chan — which spun out of 4chan after that online message board was deemed to infringe on free speech in the wake of the sexist Gamergate controversy a few years ago — has already switched to a new domain name registrar, and a new host for its site. Epik, which is also known to host Gab, was 8chan’s new host. After public pressure from people such as Alex Stamos, adjunct professor at Stanford University and former Facebook security chief, the company that leased servers to Epik cut it off.
That company, Voxility, said Monday on Twitter in response to Stamos and others who announced its ties to Epik: “We are all in the same team here! Thank you for the support and for the notes. The 3rd party hoster is blocked completely.”
Fredrick Brennan, creator of 8chan, told media outlets including the New York Times that he stopped working with 8chan’s current owner last year.
“Shut the site down,” Brennan told the Times. “It’s not doing the world any good. It’s a complete negative to everybody except the users that are there. And you know what? It’s a negative to them, too. They just don’t realize it.”
Brennan told the Washington Post that 8chan’s owner, Jim Watkins, makes little money from the site. Watkins, a U.S. military veteran and web entrepreneur who now lives in the Philippines, would not comment to the Washington Post.
In a press conference Monday, President Donald Trump, whose racist rhetoric is being blamed for inciting violence against immigrants, said, “We must shine light on the dark recesses of the internet and stop mass murders before they start. The perils of the internet and social media cannot be ignored.”
Trump has repeatedly spoken of immigrants “invading” the United States.
“According to Facebook’s ad archive, Trump has run around 2,200 FB ads since May 2018 mentioning the word ‘invasion’,” tweeted Natalie Martinez, researcher for Media Matters for America. “Scrolling through, all of them seem to be about immigration.”

Resumen: Mike Gravel, a former U.S. Senator from Alaska, ended his presidential campaign after a few months of trying to reach the Democratic debate stage.

Texto completo: Mike Gravel, a former U. S. senator and anti-war firebrand who launched an online-centric campaign for president, is officially wrapping up his quest for the White House.
The Twitter account affiliated with Gravel's campaign on Saturday thanked staffers and supporters who had helped the 89-year-old former senator from Alaska raise his profile and eventually draw more than 65,000 donors to his campaign.
"Of course, the true key has been the #Gravelanche itself, our incredible supporters and donors. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts," the account tweeted.
Gravel is set to endorse Sen. Bernie Sanders' campaign, according to The Daily Beast.
Gravel's candidacy was largely an online presence. He was not actively campaigning across the country but did occasionally sit for interviews with media organizations. When his campaign launched, Gravel focused heavily on his desire to make the debate stage to promote his anti-war stance.
But while Gravel eventually did meet the donor requirements set by the Democratic National Committee to make the debate stage, he did not meet the polling requirement.

Gravel did not poll at 1-percent or higher in three DNC-approved polls. Candidates qualified for the debate by meeting either the donor or polling thresholds, but as more than 20 candidates qualified, the DNC prioritized those who did both.
Gravel is perhaps best-known for reading the leaked Pentagon Papers into the public record while in the Senate. He previously ran an unsuccessful presidential campaign in the 2008 Democratic primary.
Gravel officially launched his campaign in April, after being convinced to run by David Oks and Henry Williams, two teenagers from New York.
Oks and Williams reached out to Gravel by email after hearing about the former senator on the Chapo Trap House podcast. They convinced Gravel to run for president after many phone calls, with Gravel eventually letting them run his Twitter account and register the campaign with the FEC, according to the New York Times Magazine.
“I’m excited to run for president in order to qualify for the Democratic debates,” Gravel said in a statement announcing his candidacy. “My message, centered around an anti-imperialist foreign policy and fundamental political reform, is one that no other Democratic candidate is making the centerpiece of their campaign. After the first two debates, I will drop out and endorse the most progressive candidate. ”
Gravel’s team signaled the end of the campaign last week.
First candidate to drop out: Eric Swalwell ends his campaign for president
“The DNC kept us off the stage tonight even though we qualified, but the #Gravelanche is not over. We're gonna keep going,” a tweet posted to his account read. “As the campaign ends, we're going to help build institutions on the left which can grow power, shape policy, and create strong activists for the long haul. ”
Subsequent posts on Gravel’s Twitter page announced Gravel’s plans for his remaining campaign funds, a leftist think tank called “the Gravel Institute. ”
Gravel’s team wrote that the think tank will write “leftist policy papers” focused on “ending the American empire,” “reforming our Democracy,” and “direct action by elected officials to end injustice and suffering. ”

Texto completo: Can you believe Christmas is right around the corner? It seems like we were just celebrating the Fourth of July, and now it's time for another Christmas season.
Okay, don't get mad and protest that I'm bringing up Christmas too early. Even though the actual holiday is still five months away, it's not too early to budget for it.
One of the most frequent stressors I hear about during the holiday season is overspending. So many people have the best intentions — and they want to give to as many people as possible — but those good intentions often come with a lot of bills in January.
If you're worried about overspending this Christmas, the fix is to do a Christmas budget. Here's how you make a very simple zero-based Christmas budget:
Step 1: Decide how much you can spend on Christmas gifts
I'm not talking about throwing Christmas parties or decorating your house. This is just about gifts.
Last year, 33 percent of Americans planned to spend $1,000 on Christmas gifts. Now, depending on your family and money situation, that might be a lot or not nearly enough. But chances are you don't have that kind of cash just lying around in your bank account, which is why you'll want to start putting a little bit aside each month starting now.
For example, let's take that number and reduce it a little. Let's say you budget $600 for Christmas gifts. That's the total amount of money you plan on spending on your family and friends this holiday season. If you start saving for that this month, you'll need to set aside $120 per month. That's if you do all your shopping in December.
Step 2: List the people you want to buy for, and how much you plan to spend on each
Your Christmas budget might look like this:
Kid One: $135
Kid Two: $135
Spouse: $50
Mom: $50
Dad: $50
In-Laws: $100
Sister: $30
Friend: $30
Office Secret Santa: $20
Step 3: Subtract all those numbers from the total amount you've budgeted for gifts
If you end up with zero, then you've perfected a zero-based Christmas budget!
Every dollar you'll spend is attached to someone's name, just like categories in a normal budget. It's that simple, and all you really need is a sheet of paper. If you prefer a digital budget, check out EveryDollar. It's the budgeting app I use.
Don't get too caught up in the specifics of this example. Your situation might be totally different. The main thing is being intentional, proactive, and precise with your spending. And when December comes around, your Christmas shopping experience will be much more merry and bright. You'll be checking everyone off your budget list, instead of spending first and worrying about the consequences later.
Merry Christmas in July, and happy budgeting.

Texto completo: George Church, the prominent Harvard University biologist, offered a full-throated apology for having meetings and phone calls with accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein even after the financier pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting a minor for prostitution.
“I certainly apologize for my poor awareness and judgment," Church told STAT in his first public comments about Epstein.
Expressing regret that he and other scientists weren't more cautious in their dealings with Epstein, he said: “There should have been more conversations about, 'Should we be doing this, should we be helping this guy?' There was just a lot of nerd tunnel vision."
He added, “My main concern is for the people who have been hurt," the girls and young women Epstein was accused last month of having brought to his Manhattan and Palm Beach, Fla., homes for sex (a charge Epstein denies).
Since the indictment last month, news reports have described numerous meetings Epstein organized, both before and after his 2008 conviction, with physicists, biologists, mathematicians, and other researchers. He seemed to believe his interactions with scientists, especially those at Harvard, would buff his reputation in the financial world, saying on his website that he had “the privilege of sponsoring many prominent scientists."
Asked how so many of them could have associated with Epstein after his guilty plea and 13-month sentence, Church said that scientists “might not have realized the enormity of his transgressions," especially since Epstein seemed to be welcomed back into society after he served his sentence. “That's my most generous interpretation."
In addition, he said, scientists are as vulnerable to flattery and attention from prominent people as anyone. “If it's a rich person [asking about their research], that's cool," Church said. “Or if it's a politician or a movie star, [scientists] would be flattered if they took time out of their own activities to learn something about quasars or recombinant DNA."
As for whether Epstein's 2008 conviction gave Church (a father and grandfather) pause, he said, “I did read a couple of news articles" a decade ago, he said, “but they weren't clear enough for me to know there was a serious problem.
“But that is still no excuse for me not being abreast of the news."
Church said he is used to financiers, technologists, and celebrities seeking him out, and has become a quasi-celebrity himself. But Church also has unquestioned scientific gravitas, having helped develop genome sequencing as well as CRISPR genome editing, and founded or advised dozens of biotech companies.
Now, Church is the only science luminary to publicly apologize for interactions with Epstein.
Many influential scientists met Epstein through New York literary agent John Brockman, who, starting in 1999, hosted an annual “billionaires dinner" where some of his authors mingled with moguls. Epstein attended several of the dinners from 2000 to 2011, and Brockman described him on his online salon Edge.org as a “science philanthropist."
Church, whose 2012 book “Regenesis" was shepherded by Brockman, said he met Epstein in 2006, either through Brockman or through the then-chairman of the Harvard psychology department, Stephen Kosslyn, a member of Edge.org.
He confirmed NBC's recent report that he had six phone calls and meetings with Epstein in 2014, as shown in Church's online calendar (he has posted one every year since 1999). Sample entry: “Jun 21, 2014 Lunch w/ Jeffrey Epstein, 12-1:30, Martin Nowak's Institute." (Nowak, a Harvard biologist/mathematician, is also a Brockman client and Edge participant. He also met with Epstein “several times" each year since, Church said. (Brockman and Nowak could not be reached for comment over the weekend.)
Asked what interested Epstein about Church's work, Church paused before saying, “I don't think he picked me. So in that sense he may not have been that interested."
Instead, many of his meetings with Epstein were with Nowak, to whose then-fledgling Program for Evolutionary Dynamics Epstein contributed $6.5 million in 2003, five years before his guilty plea. Church and Nowak have worked together on, among other things, the evolution of CRISPR-based gene drives. At the get-togethers with Nowak, Church said, Epstein seemed interested in the science of life's origins and mathematically modeling the evolution of viruses, cancer cells, and life itself.
Church knew nothing about Epstein's interest in eugenics in the early 2000s, he said. According to The New York Times, Epstein hoped that multiple women would be inseminated with his sperm. Church has done boundary-pushing research on “recoding life" (to, among other things, make cells resistant to viruses) and argued that making heritable changes in the genomes of embryos should not be off the table, which might have made him a sounding board for eugenic fantasies.
But “I never heard anything about it," Church said. “I'd have thought that I would have been involved in that kind of conversation, but it didn't tend to go in that direction. But also, I think people tend to behave themselves around me."
A longtime associate of Church seemed surprised that he became involved with Epstein, since Church has prioritized ethics. (The associate declined to be named in a story about Epstein.) Church invited a philosopher to work in his lab to flag bioethics issues in experiments, and for years has taught a research ethics course, which is unusual for someone of his prominence.
Universities are supposed to vet potential donors who ask to meet with faculty members. But Epstein did not offer to fund Church's research, so Harvard did not get involved. “Instead, a lot of [Epstein's interactions] with me happened through Martin [Nowak]'s institute, and the university was well aware of that connection" because of Epstein's $6.5 million donation, Church said.
“My understanding is this [vetting] is the responsibility of the development office, which is yet another reason why scientists are a little bit more relaxed. They feel they have administrators, who in theory do the difficult job of figuring out who's legit, who's actually going to write a check, if you're going to spend hours talking to somebody."
But that happens only if the request “is anything financial or contractual," Church said, not if it's lunch or a phone call. That was up to Church.
Scientists, “myself included, are not very good" at screening out people, he said. “I think many of them also feel an exceptionalism," meaning they should be allowed to associate with anyone if it is for a greater good. He recalled how in the 1990s, renowned molecular biologist and Nobel laureate Sydney Brenner, who died in April at age 92, defended the $15 million he accepted from cigarette giant Philip Morris for a biology institute in California that he had founded, arguing that basic science was a better cause than other uses the company might have for its millions.
Did Church believe Epstein had “paid his debt to society" in 2008 and deserved another chance? “As far as I know people just didn't have that conversation," Church said. “But it should have."
Scientists' feeling that they cannot be morally tainted by their associations “may not be rational, or helpful, or correct," Church allowed. Still, he added, “I would like to think that people's reputation is multidimensional and multiyear — that it takes a long time to build up but also to tear down." He was speaking both generally and about himself.

Racism Is Everyone's Problem

Texto completo: Kirsten Gillibrand made an important distinction when she talked about the problem of white privilege during the Democratic debate Wednesday night in Detroit.
The moderator asked her what she would "do for Baltimore and other cities that need help" after the president wrote racist tweets attacking both the city and one of its congressional representatives, Elijah E. Cummings.
She said: "I can talk to those white women in the suburbs that voted for Trump and explain to them what white privilege actually is."
"When their son is walking down the street with a bag of M&Ms in his pocket, wearing a hoodie, his whiteness is what protects him" from being shot, she said, invoking Trayvon Martin. "When their child has a car that breaks down and he knocks on someone's door for help and the door opens and the help is given, it's his whiteness that protects him from being shot."
She also made clear that it is not the sole responsibility of candidates of color to talk about racism. It was refreshing to hear and should be the start of a new way of talking about race.
In contrast, when the moderators asked the other candidates about how they would deal with racial hostility, they all made the same rhetorical pivot, talking about blacks and other people of color instead. They decried urban blight, school segregation, health care disparities and problematic law enforcement. As an African-American woman raised in the urban South, I am happy they're willing to acknowledge these issues. But all candidates should start to speak to white people about race and the ways that policies they take for granted are directly implicated in creating these social problems.
Ms. Gillibrand's response was years in the making. Before President Barack Obama, scholars of black politics noted that black candidates usually ran campaigns that avoided explicit discussions of racially sensitive issues and eschewed behavior that might play into racial stereotypes. After Mr. Obama's presidency there will be no more campaigns where identity politics can be ignored. His presence in the White House required all Americans to contend with the changing demographic of this country and with the fact that we will continue to see more leaders of color.
In 2016, Democratic candidates, under pressure from movement activists, began to talk more openly about systemic forms of racism. Now, anyone wanting the party's nomination has to be able to identify examples of racial disparities.
This is significant because we are in a political moment where open expressions of racial bigotry and intolerance are more frequent and belligerent. The number of hate crimes and membership in hate groups are both increasing. The president has chosen to use issues like immigration, crime and the census to foment racial fears among whites. There are no more dog whistles; our leaders are using bullhorns to spread their racism.
Democrats have made impressive steps by openly acknowledging that both individual and systemic racism continue to infect our lives. It is more than Republicans are willing to do. But it's only the first step. There's no need to explain to people of color the ways that racism shapes their lives. Instead, real remedies require a frank discussion with people who perpetrate racism and who benefit from racist policies.
Here's a solution for white people: Don't answer questions on race by listing the struggles of people of color. Talk about what you can or will do to decrease support for white nationalism among whites.
It would be impressive -- game-changing, even -- if candidates responded to a question from the moderator with a discussion of how white privilege and racism have shaped this country so profoundly that some whites cannot even see the ways they are recipients of racist benefits.
Imagine hearing them reveal how their own views on race have evolved over time and what that process has meant for their own lives. Has it changed the racial composition of their friends, whom they hire, where they send their kids to school or where they live?
America is made far less safe by people who refuse to call out all the ways that racial hostility is rapidly growing. We know what the symptoms are. People of color live them out daily. Sometimes, however, we find ourselves asking public officials why they are only talking to and about us. Ms. Gillibrand offered a better way forward for Democrats and white people. I hope others follow her lead.

Texto completo: The 911 call came just after sunrise on Saturday: A woman was being attacked outside a house in Maplewood, N.J.
When officers arrived, they found a woman lying on the street -- critically injured but still alive -- outside a two-story colonial-style home. The police entered the house and discovered a male victim.
The man, David Kimowitz, 40, who managed comedians and owned a popular comedy club in New York City, was pronounced dead in his home, the authorities said on Sunday. The woman, Karen L. Bermudez-Rodriguez, 26, an au pair for Mr. Kimowitz's two young children, later died at Newark Beth Israel Medical Center.
The police announced on Sunday that they had arrested Ms. Bermudez-Rodriguez's boyfriend, Joseph D. Porter, 27, of Elizabeth, New Jersey, in connection with the deaths. He was charged with two counts of murder, possession of a weapon and possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose and criminal restraint. He is being held at the Essex County Correctional Facility.
Mr. Kimowitz's two young daughters and his wife, Laura, were not home at the time of the attack, the authorities said.
The killings stunned residents of the leafy suburban town about 20 miles west of New York City. Until Saturday, there had been only 15 homicides in Maplewood, a town of about 25,000 people, over the past three decades, according to state and federal authorities.
Neighbors said on Sunday that they could hear Ms. Bermudez-Rodriguez screaming from inside their homes before she collapsed on the street.
"It's a shocking feeling," Kathy Cantwell, who lives next door to the Kimowitz family, said. "You wish you could have interceded or you could have saved David."
Several neighbors said that in the days before the attack, they noticed a man they did not recognize sitting in a dark-colored sedan near the family's house. While they had alerted one another about the man, they did not call the police. The authorities have not said whether that man was Mr. Porter.
On Sunday, a large portion of Walton Road, a tree-lined street with rows of clapboard homes, remained an active crime scene. Yellow police tape surrounded the Kimowitzes' home, and officers were seen looking through shrubs outside nearby homes.
Neighbors of the Kimowitz family, who had bought the house on a corner lot in 2017, said that the family's daughters were often seen playing outside with Ms. Bermudez-Rodriguez.
On Sunday, friends placed flowers outside the house, at the intersection of Walton Road and Jefferson Avenue.
Andrew De la Torre, who lived near the Kimowitzes, said it seemed that the family had employed several au pairs, who rotated every few months, since they moved into the house.
"They have a little balcony that they would be playing out there with their kids," Mr. De la Torre said on Sunday. "They'd have family friends over. Really nice people."
Mr. Kimowitz was well-known in the New York comedy scene, as both a manager of comedians and one of four founders of the Stand Restaurant and Comedy Club, a comedy venue near Gramercy Park in Manhattan.
While the biggest club in town, the Comedy Cellar, attracted comedy elite like Jerry Seinfeld and Dave Chappelle, the Stand maintained a steady rotation of high-profile performers including Tracy Morgan, Janeane Garofalo and Dave Attell. "There's a stigma about comedy clubs," Mr. Kimowitz told The New York Times in an interview in 2012. "They're tourist traps, watered-down drinks. We're trying to evolve the comedy club."
The Stand closed its Gramercy Park location last year and reopened a few weeks ago in a fancier and larger space near Union Square. The founders added an upscale restaurant in an attempt to differentiate itself from other clubs. The club also has a green room -- a rarity in most clubs -- and two rooms with low ceilings for intimate performances.
The Stand also hosts a popular weekly comedy podcast, "The Legion of Skanks," which features comedians managed by Mr. Kimowitz.
In 2012, Mr. Kimowitz and the same group that had opened the Stand started the Standing Room comedy club in Long Island City, Queens. While they had hoped to attract top comedians to perform there, the Standing Room could not replicate the success of the Manhattan venue and closed last summer.
Comedians who knew Mr. Kimowitz said that they were stunned by the news of his death.
"A great guy and friend has passed this weekend," Rich Vos, a comedian, said on Twitter. "He seemed so happy, a wife, 2 kids, his new club opened."
A LinkedIn page for Mr. Kimowitz said that he had received a bachelor's degree in history from Columbia University in New York in 2002 and had joined several comedy ventures, including a company called Cringe Humor, which had started the Stand. He was also a partner of CH Entertainment, a talent agency with clients that included Mr. Vos. The group previously represented the comedian Pete Davidson.

Texto completo: You can bet that T'Challa would never forget Queen Ramonda on Mother's Day. But in "Otherhood," her new Netflix film, Angela Bassett - beloved by fans as the regal matriarch of Wakanda in "Black Panther" - plays a woman so accustomed to neglect by her adult son that she sends herself bouquets from him on the holiday each year. With this note: "You are the best mother ever."
So when she and her similarly disregarded best friends, played by Patricia Arquette and Felicity Huffman, realize that they've become "others" instead of mothers, these suburban empty-nesters storm Manhattan in a Volvo station wagon in pursuit of their offspring's attention and respect.
"I just thought it was hysterical - I was falling over," Bassett said of the film directed and co-written by Cindy Chupack ("Sex and the City"). "That's rare to read a script and to really laugh out loud."
And dipping her toes into the comedic realm was a welcome counterbalance to her work on Fox's "9-1-1," which last season catapulted Bassett's character, Field Sgt. Athena Grant of the Los Angeles Police Department, into natural disasters before marrying her off to the fire captain (Peter Krause).
Alas, mothering briefly got the best of "Otherhood" when its premiere was pushed from April to August after Huffman was arrested for her involvement in a college admissions scandal. "We all make mistakes. None of us is perfect," Bassett said. "I think Felicity handled these unfortunate circumstances in a mature, responsible way. She held herself accountable and didn't make excuses for her decisions, and I can only respect that."
These days, Bassett is hoping to add a matching Emmy to that of her husband, Courtney B. Vance, with her nomination as narrator of "The Flood," a National Geographic special about the Okavango Delta in Africa. Calling from Los Angeles, she happily chatted about how she's trying to guarantee that Bronwyn and Slater, their 13-year-old twins, never let Mother's Day go unnoticed.
These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
Q: It's been a while since you hung with girlfriends onscreen. How did you find your groove with Patricia and Felicity?
A: They were both warm, wonderful, delightful, talented, hardworking women that made you laugh. It was easy to establish a camaraderie.
Q: What are the joys to be found in the female squad-com?
A: I've done it a couple of times - "Waiting to Exhale" and then this. And the film "Gunpowder Milkshake," which I just finished my portion of in Germany, is a female-driven action thriller, with the wonderful Michelle Yeoh and Carla Gugino and Lena Headey and Karen Gillan. It's such a delight to be around women who get it - full of life, full of laughter and love. No egos. They just shared the best of themselves, their knowledge of their experiences.
Q: Your character, Carol, has a son who's loath to invite her to a work party. But you recently took your son to see the rapper Logic and he seemed pretty great with it.
A: Before I went away to work this summer, in Berlin for six weeks, I surprised him. It was a Friday. That's the No. 1 surprise: "You're not going to school today." Then I've got the Logic T-shirt. And then I said: "Oh, and last surprise. You have a private meet-and-greet with Logic before his show." That's when he really lost it. He was the best kid ever. I was the boss mom ever. I think it enhanced the relationship.
Q: They will not be forgetting you on Mother's Day, right?
A: My daughter will give me something special. An ankle bracelet, jewelry, something sweet. My son will give me a book on tacos. "You like to cook, but I like tacos. Here, Mom." That's who he is.
Q: You've just started shooting Season 3 of "9-1-1." What's it like taking on a role that keeps you running?
A: You know what? It will keep me in line because polyester doesn't stretch. My uniform's a little tight this summer. It's hard to run in tight polyester. You really have to mind your P's and Q's.
Q: Before "9-1-1," you collaborated with Ryan Murphy for four years on "American Horror Story" as well. What's the root of your loyalty?
A: As surprised as the audiences are from week to week, we actors are surprised as well when we sit down and open each ensuing episode. It's mind-blow-ing but it's great. I love behind the scenes, because it gives opportunity to those who are deserving. And in front of the camera, roles for women or for characters that may be on the outside. Things that are just the norm - that's not interesting to Ryan.
Q: When is "Black Panther 2" coming out, and are you in it?
A: I have no idea but I assume that I will be in there. I didn't ask that they roll my body in the ocean with my ancestors.
Q: Did the overwhelming embrace of "Black Panther" surprise you?
A: Absolutely. I'm not big in the comic book world. I would go online and see some of the fanboy-girl excitement, and so I had an inkling that it would be big with them. But that it would just cross so many boundaries and resonate with so many different people - 84-year-old women would come up to me and say, "Wakanda forever." Or little boys from Ireland were like, "It's Queen Ramonda!" It really was very satisfying to be a part of a project that touched audiences and made them feel good about themselves and about the world.
Q: You've said that you related to Carol's blossoming in "Otherhood." But you seem to be in full bloom, having stirred things up on Instagram with a bikini shot on your 60th birthday last year. What do you have planned for your 61st?
A: Now I told you my polyester's a little tight so I won't be doing that this year. Yeah, a lot was made of that. I was feeling very confident, having a good time, and it's like, Hey, why not? It was different for me, so there was going to be a little shock factor. I'm going to be on set working this year on "9-1-1." Am I blossoming? I just try to blossom every day, I think, in some small way. It can't always be a bikini shot.

The Russians are coming — for real

Texto completo: In his recent testimony on Capitol Hill, former special counsel Robert S. Mueller issued a warning that echoed the 1966 movie comedy, "The Russians Are Coming! The Russians Are Coming!" Except he wasn’t joking. Far from it.
"Over the course of my career," said the longtime FBI director, "I have seen a number of challenges to our democracy. The Russian government’s effort to interfere in our election is among the most serious."
So how did President Donald Trump and his acolytes respond? By denying and denouncing the unvarnished truth Mueller had stated. By plunging their heads deeply into the sands of self-delusion. Within days of Mueller’s appearance, Trump had engineered the departure of Dan Coats, his director of national intelligence, who had earned a reputation for courageous candor by refuting the president’s prejudices and emphasizing Moscow’s malign machinations.
Every Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee signed a bipartisan report documenting the "growing volume of malicious activity" targeted at U.S. election systems. And while the senior Republican, Richard Burr of North Carolina, said some progress has been made in protecting those systems, "There is still much work that remains to be done."
At the same time, practical bipartisan legislation aimed at bolstering the ability of election officials to ward off Soviet subversion was blocked by the Senate’s Republican leader and Trump’s Chief Enabler, Mitch McConnell.
Trump’s relentless refusal to acknowledge Russia’s role in his victory symbolizes a much larger flaw in his approach to the presidency: rejecting any information that contradicts his view of the world. Take just one example: After his intelligence chief Dan Coats testified last January that Iran was living up to their nuclear agreements, an enraged president tweeted that his own intelligence team should "go back to school." Then he added: "They are wrong!"
There it is. Pure Trump. I am right and they are wrong. And that approach makes rational decision-making and problem-solving impossible.
How can the nation respond to the tocsins tolled by Mueller, Coats, Burr and Wray (Republicans all) if there are no accepted facts, no common basis for deliberation, no respect for the professional researchers and analysts whose life works are to study, measure and describe reality? The answer is clear. America cannot respond and the public knows it. In the latest ABC/Ipsos poll, only 17% said they were "very confident" that "the U.S. can effectively defend itself" from foreign intrusions into next year’s campaign.
It’s entirely appropriate for lawmakers to disagree on policies and priorities. But the whole process of decision-making is severely crippled when those lawmakers cannot even agree on the nature of the problem they are trying to solve. As Douglas Wise, a former CIA officer and deputy head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, told The New York Times: "Intelligence has to be candid, truthful and accurate even if it is unpleasant and does not confirm to the biases of the president."
The Russians are indeed coming. And Trump is not building a wall to keep them out. He’s opening a door to invite them in.

Trump was right about Baltimore

Texto completo: President Trump was wrong to personally attack Rep. Elijah E. Cummings, D.-Md., a man widely respected by both Democrats and Republicans alike. But Trump was absolutely right when he called Baltimore "dangerous," "filthy" and "rodent infested" - that is, if you can believe what you read in the "failing New York Times."
In March, the Times Sunday magazine published a heart-rending story titled "The Tragedy of Baltimore," which chronicled the precipitous decline of the city. It described how then-Mayor Catherine Pugh (D) toured the Highlandtown section of southeast Baltimore, as community leaders showed her a block where prostitutes gathered and there were piles of uncollected garbage and a liquor store that allowed drunks to congregate while pretending to wait for the bus. " 'Watch your step,' someone called out as the group neared a dead rat," the Times reported.
The city's "regression has been swift and demoralizing," the Times wrote, adding that officials have "struggled to respond to the rise in disorder, leaving residents with the unsettling feeling that there was no one in charge." One resident contrasted the tourist-friendly Inner Harbor with her West Baltimore neighborhood, where, she said, "we're all bolted in our homes, we're locked down."
Residents are locked down with good reason. In 2017, Baltimore had 343 homicides, a new record for killings per capita - more than New York City, which has 14 times Baltimore's population. In 2018, there were 309 homicides, and so far in 2019, there were 171 homicides as of July 11 - up from 147 homicides at the same time last year. Baltimore is quite literally experiencing "American carnage."
While the national poverty rate has dropped from 14.8% to 12.3% since 2014, Baltimore's remains virtually unchanged at 22.4%. Children are trapped in failing schools that can't teach them to read or do math at grade level. No wonder Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., once compared Baltimore to "a Third World country" and said it is "a community in which half of the people don't have jobs [and] in which there are hundreds of buildings that are uninhabitable." This is happening in Maryland, the richest state in the country. Talk about income inequality!
Pointing out these facts is not racist. It is also not racist to say that no one would want to live in these conditions - we should all agree that no one should have to. Nor is it racist to point out that this human tragedy is the responsibility of Baltimore's leaders, and the direct result of five decades of Democratic rule. Democrats have held a lock on the Baltimore mayor's office since 1967. They run the City Council, the school system, the sanitation system, the housing authority and police department, and they represent the city in Washington. Gov. Larry Hogan (R), only the second Republican governor of Maryland since 1969, does bear some responsibility. But Baltimore is a deep-blue city in a deep-blue state; its plight is almost entirely a Democrat-created disaster.
Trump is wrong to attack Cummings for conducting vigorous oversight of conditions on the southern border; as chairman of the House oversight committee, that is his job. But Democrats want to have it both ways. They want to criticize what they see as inhumane conditions in U.S. detention facilities (and give a pass to those like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who outrageously compare those facilities to "concentration camps") but then call Trump a racist for criticizing inhumane conditions in Baltimore.
The irony is, Democrats are in large part responsible for both situations. For months they refused to provide the emergency funds Trump requested to address the surge in border crossings, which left U.S. facilities on the border under-resourced and overwhelmed. And for years they have ruled Baltimore as a one-party fiefdom as the city turned into an island of despair amid a sea of prosperity.
The tragedy of Trump's presidency is that he should be championing the people of Baltimore rather than using their plight to attack one of his critics. In 2016, Trump visited a black church in Detroit and gave a major speech in Charlotte in which he promised black Americans, "Whether you vote for me or not, I will be your greatest champion." Last year, he was supposed to visit Baltimore to deliver a similar message but canceled. That would have been a lot more effective than a tweetstorm that only prompts Baltimore's beleaguered residents to rally around their incompetent Democratic leaders.

An estate planning lawyer’s approach to blended families

Texto completo: This is part three in a series of five articles discussing the following case hypothetical from the various professional perspectives:
A and B are getting married. A has two kids from a previous marriage. B has one child from a prior marriage. They plan to have children together. A receives child support from a former spouse. A’s mother also lives with them and helps care for the children. B’s only child works in B’s business and both A and B hope their joint child(ren) will one day join the business as well. A and B have a lot to discuss!
The first thing I would tell A and B about their estate planning is “don’t try to plan for the next 20 years right now.” Trying to plan for too many “what ifs” can cause analysis paralysis. The best practice is to get a plan in place that addresses the “what ifs” of the next three to five years. That’s particularly true for A and B — newlyweds with a newly blended family. That’s why trusts are living documents — they need to be reviewed and adjusted over time as families, circumstances and laws change.
As long as you remain competent and alive, you can amend your trust. And if you don’t, well, you’ve put the right plan in place at the right time.
Currently, there are minor children involved. Were A to pass away, A may want or need to plan for the support and care of the children rather than B, who is likely self-sufficient and not dependent on A’s support at this early stage in their relationship. Later, when A’s children are grown and gone, A is more likely to want or need to provide for B.
B currently has to think about B’s business. In the event of B’s death, B may want to see B’s child carry on the business. If A needs an income stream from B’s estate however, an outright transfer of the business might not work. B’s options would include keeping the business owned by a trust with income paid to A, but with B’s child still running the business and getting a salary. Or, perhaps B can obtain life insurance that would pay to A and allow the business to be transferred to his child.
Life insurance or some other income stream (retirement plans, annuities, etc.) of B are useful here. If A is significantly younger than B, or close in age to B’s child, and B plans to provide for A first, then B’s child, there could be tension. A plan that has a child “waiting around for step-parent to die” can be an invitation to discord (witness the step-parent vs. children disputes of celebrities like Casey Kasem, Robin Williams and Glen Campbell).
If B has a stream of income that can be directed to either B’s child or A with the remaining assets going to the other of them, that can reduce tension. This may give the best hope for a continuing relationship between a child and a step-parent.
In the event of A’s death or incapacity, does the surviving biological parent (e.g. A’s ex-spouse) have custody of the minor children? If so, A may not be able to plan for B’s involvement with the children, but perhaps leaving money in trust with B as the trustee will at least assure some contact and oversight. If not, A will need to carefully consider whether A’s mother or B should be named guardian of the children.
At a minimum, A will want to get powers of attorney and health care directives for minors that allow for A’s mother and B to take care of the children in an emergency, including making health care decisions for the children if A is not able to.
If A and B should die together, who gets what and when requires careful analysis.
A’s children are younger than B’s one child, and if they have additional children in the future, the age gap will be greater. A and B can consider a “common trust” that holds all assets in one trust for the benefit of all children until the youngest child reaches a certain age or graduates from college.
The trustee makes distribution for “health, education, support and maintenance” of all the children, but is not required to do so equally. This gives the youngest child the same advantages as the older children for whom college, a car, perhaps a wedding, was already paid for prior to their parents’ passing.
When the youngest child reaches the stated age, the trust can be divided into shares for the children and distributed outright or over time when each child hits a certain age. The size of those shares is another area for discussion.
Does B’s child get half and A’s children split the other half? If A and B have a child together does that child get a portion of each half? The short-term answer is likely to be much different than the answer 20 years from now.
The decisions to be made will necessarily take into consideration whether there is a large disparity between the assets of A and B, and there are many formulas and approaches to deciding what’s “fair.”
I would say to A and B what I often say to my clients: This may be the first time you’ve had to design your estate plan, but your lawyer has done hundreds if not thousands of plans. No matter how complicated you may think your family is, it’s our job to help you figure out what works for your family, to provide some options for you, and get it all documented.
Then A and B can concentrate on the fun parts of their upcoming Brady Bunch life together. And I’d also say congratulations! And best wishes! And I’ll see you again in three to five years.

Texto completo: This is part three in a series of five articles discussing the following case hypothetical from the various professional perspectives:
A and B are getting married. A has two kids from a previous marriage. B has one child from a prior marriage. They plan to have children together. A receives child support from a former spouse. A’s mother also lives with them and helps care for the children. B’s only child works in B’s business and both A and B hope their joint child(ren) will one day join the business as well. A and B have a lot to discuss!
The first thing I would tell A and B about their estate planning is “don’t try to plan for the next 20 years right now.” Trying to plan for too many “what ifs” can cause analysis paralysis. The best practice is to get a plan in place that addresses the “what ifs” of the next three to five years. That’s particularly true for A and B — newlyweds with a newly blended family. That’s why trusts are living documents — they need to be reviewed and adjusted over time as families, circumstances and laws change.
As long as you remain competent and alive, you can amend your trust. And if you don’t, well, you’ve put the right plan in place at the right time.
Currently, there are minor children involved. Were A to pass away, A may want or need to plan for the support and care of the children rather than B, who is likely self-sufficient and not dependent on A’s support at this early stage in their relationship. Later, when A’s children are grown and gone, A is more likely to want or need to provide for B.
B currently has to think about B’s business. In the event of B’s death, B may want to see B’s child carry on the business. If A needs an income stream from B’s estate however, an outright transfer of the business might not work. B’s options would include keeping the business owned by a trust with income paid to A, but with B’s child still running the business and getting a salary. Or, perhaps B can obtain life insurance that would pay to A and allow the business to be transferred to his child.
Life insurance or some other income stream (retirement plans, annuities, etc.) of B are useful here. If A is significantly younger than B, or close in age to B’s child, and B plans to provide for A first, then B’s child, there could be tension. A plan that has a child “waiting around for step-parent to die” can be an invitation to discord (witness the step-parent vs. children disputes of celebrities like Casey Kasem, Robin Williams and Glen Campbell).
If B has a stream of income that can be directed to either B’s child or A with the remaining assets going to the other of them, that can reduce tension. This may give the best hope for a continuing relationship between a child and a step-parent.
In the event of A’s death or incapacity, does the surviving biological parent (e.g. A’s ex-spouse) have custody of the minor children? If so, A may not be able to plan for B’s involvement with the children, but perhaps leaving money in trust with B as the trustee will at least assure some contact and oversight. If not, A will need to carefully consider whether A’s mother or B should be named guardian of the children.
At a minimum, A will want to get powers of attorney and health care directives for minors that allow for A’s mother and B to take care of the children in an emergency, including making health care decisions for the children if A is not able to.
If A and B should die together, who gets what and when requires careful analysis.
A’s children are younger than B’s one child, and if they have additional children in the future, the age gap will be greater. A and B can consider a “common trust” that holds all assets in one trust for the benefit of all children until the youngest child reaches a certain age or graduates from college.
The trustee makes distribution for “health, education, support and maintenance” of all the children, but is not required to do so equally. This gives the youngest child the same advantages as the older children for whom college, a car, perhaps a wedding, was already paid for prior to their parents’ passing.
When the youngest child reaches the stated age, the trust can be divided into shares for the children and distributed outright or over time when each child hits a certain age. The size of those shares is another area for discussion.
Does B’s child get half and A’s children split the other half? If A and B have a child together does that child get a portion of each half? The short-term answer is likely to be much different than the answer 20 years from now.
The decisions to be made will necessarily take into consideration whether there is a large disparity between the assets of A and B, and there are many formulas and approaches to deciding what’s “fair.”

Texto completo: Face it, Donald Trump is going to win again.
One disclaimer: He wins if the economy remains strong into November 2020.
Go ahead and @ me and send your, ahem, fan mail. They can say whatever on cable and social media about Trump being finished. CNN and Twitter aren't the real world. Ohio and Kentucky are.
And when Trump packs Greater Cincinnatians into U.S. Bank Arena the way he did for Thursday night's rally on the heels of back-to-back days of the Democratic presidential candidates spouting socialist rhetoric in their debates, well, it's not exactly a big leap to assume Trump will get four more years.
"America will never, ever be a socialist country," Trump told the capacity crowd.
He's right. Normal Democrats will be the first (or maybe the second) to tell you that. Joe Biden is a normal Democrat, his party's one legitimate hope for defeating Trump. He continues to lead in the polls – of which you should always be skeptical – but he's slipping as the far left continues to tear down the former vice president for daring to be pragmatic Uncle Joe.
There was a headline in the New York Times on Thursday that read: "Joe Biden is learning that liberals eat their own." Per columnist David French's piece: "It's astonishing to see other Democratic candidates attack him for his role in their party's historic successes."
French pointed out that Biden was right there with President Obama on the Affordable Care Act. Biden was right there with Obama on following federal deportation laws. Liberals were all good with those policies and actions a few years ago, but now Biden's too moderate.
If Biden somehow survives the far-left ambush and wins his party's nomination, I might have to renege on the first line of this column. I'm just not sure he can. Democrats are too far down the socialist rabbit hole, and there's no turning back in this election – at least in the eyes of the voters.
It may not even matter if Trump continues to perform the way he did here. He was actually kind of normal. He mostly stuck to the teleprompter for his one-hour, 25-minute speech. Despite speaking for that long – by far the windiest speech he's given in seven campaign and presidential visits to Greater Cincinnati – Trump didn't give the Democrats much to work with.
He used his speech as a rebuttal to the Democratic debates, hammering away at the socialist rhetoric. He continued to pin the failings of urban economic and education policies on the Democratic mayors and councils that run most of America's big cities. He didn't constantly repeat his tired, go-to lines – "build the wall," "drain the swamp," blah, blah, blah – the way he has in past rallies.
Trump made reference to the "four far-left extremists" who he says are running the Democratic Party. He didn't mention any of them by name, but he was talking about freshmen Congresswomen Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley and Rashida Tlaib.
Everyone in the press pen was waiting for the crowd to start chanting: "Send her back," a reference to a recent Trump tweet in which he called for Omar to leave the U.S. The chant never happened. Bravo, Cincinnati. You're better than that, and you showed it.
Don't count on Trump to keep following the script at future rallies. It's not him to consistently dial down the divisive rhetoric. The nonsensical rhetoric aside, the key for Trump is to continue to tell Middle America that he's focused on jobs and keeping people safe.
Those are the two things that matter most to most Americans – the silent majority of Republicans and Democrats. It's a message that none of the Democratic candidates are delivering.
It's important not to get caught up in the emotions of one event. Thursday's crowd might've been the largest in the 44-year history of the riverfront arena, but it was still a teeny sample size of the electorate.
I've actually been thinking Trump is going to win re-election ever since the Nancy Pelosi-AOC clash became more public last month. It further exposed the party schism that we've been seeing for months in the Democratic presidential race.
Nonetheless, the rally showed that Trump's support in all-important Ohio remains strong. Maybe it showed his support has gotten even stronger here. Trump started his post-election, nationwide victory lap at U.S. Bank Arena on Dec. 1, 2016, and I remember there being thousands of empty seats in the upper deck.
All the seats were full this time. It made me wonder if Republicans are extra motivated after months of socialist rhetoric and out-of-touch ideas coming from the other side. Guess the Democrats haven't learned a darn thing from 2016.

Texto completo: MSNBC host Joy Reid and New York Times writer Wajahat Ali floated the idea that Russian bots are boosting Rep. Tulsi Gabbard's presidential bid on Twitter.
"Beware the Russian bots and their promotion of Tulsi Gabbard and sowing racial dischord [sic], especially around Kamala Harris," said Ali, who contributes both to the Times and CNN.
"It is notable that her purpose in these debates has been specifically to take Harris down," Reid responded to Ali's tweet.Tweet
In February, NBC issued a report on Gabbard's campaign that claimed she had "become a favorite of the sites Moscow used when it interfered in 2016."
The 2020 hopeful has received criticism for meeting with Russian-backed Syrian dictator Bashar Assad in 2017.
After the Democratic primary debate Wednesday, Gabbard called Sen. Kamala Harris' accusations that she was an Assad apologist a "cheap smear." She added she believed Assad was a torturer and murderer.
After the first presidential debate in June, Gabbard claimed that Google censored her campaign, for which reason she is suing the company for $50 million. After the second debate, she was the most Googled Democratic candidate in the field.
Gabbard is currently tied for ninth place in the Democratic presidential primary with 1% support in the polls, according to RealClearPolitics.

Trump wrong to attack Cummings, right about Baltimore

Texto completo: President Trump was wrong to personally attack Rep. Elijah E. Cummings, D.-Md., a man widely respected by both Democrats and Republicans alike. But Trump was absolutely right when he called Baltimore "dangerous," "filthy" and "rodent infested" -- that is, if you can believe what you read in the "failing New York Times."

In March, the Times Sunday magazine published a heart-rending story entitled "The Tragedy of Baltimore," which chronicled the precipitous decline of the city. It described how then-Mayor Catherine Pugh (D) toured the Highlandtown section of southeast Baltimore, as community leaders showed her a block where prostitutes gathered and there were piles of uncollected garbage and a liquor store that allowed drunks to congregate while pretending to wait for the bus. "'Watch your step,' someone called out as the group neared a dead rat," the Times reported.

The city's "regression has been swift and demoralizing," the Times wrote, adding that officials have "struggled to respond to the rise in disorder, leaving residents with the unsettling feeling that there was no one in charge." One resident contrasted the tourist-friendly Inner Harbor with her West Baltimore neighborhood, where, she said, "we're all bolted in our homes, we're locked down."

Residents are locked down with good reason. In 2017, Baltimore had 343 homicides, a new record for killings per capita -- more than New York City, which has 14 times Baltimore's population. In 2018, there were 309 homicides, and so far in 2019, there were 171 homicides as of July 11 -- up from 147 homicides at the same time last year. Baltimore is quite literally experiencing "American carnage."

While the national poverty rate has dropped from 14.8% to 12.3% since 2014, Baltimore's remains virtually unchanged at 22.4%. Children are trapped in failing schools that can't teach them to read or do math at grade level. No wonder Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., once compared Baltimore to "a Third World country" and said it is "a community in which half of the people don't have jobs [and] in which there are hundreds of buildings that are uninhabitable." This is happening in Maryland, the richest state in the country. Talk about income inequality!

Pointing out these facts is not racist. It is also not racist to say that no one would want to live in these conditions -- we should all agree that no one should have to. Nor is it racist to point out that this human tragedy is the responsibility of Baltimore's leaders, and the direct result of five decades of Democratic rule. Democrats have held a lock on the Baltimore mayor's office since 1967. They run the city council, the school system, the sanitation system, the housing authority and police department, and they represent the city in Washington. Gov. Larry Hogan (R), only the second Republican governor of Maryland since 1969, does bear some responsibility. But Baltimore is a deep-blue city in a deep-blue state; its plight is almost entirely a Democrat-created disaster.

Trump is wrong to attack Cummings for conducting vigorous oversight of conditions on the southern border; as chairman of the House oversight committee, that is his job. But Democrats want to have it both ways. They want to criticize what they see as inhumane conditions in U.S. detention facilities (and give a pass to those like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who outrageously compare those facilities to "concentration camps") but then call Trump a racist for criticizing inhumane conditions in Baltimore.

The irony is, Democrats are in large part responsible for both situations. For months they refused to provide the emergency funds Trump requested to address the surge in border crossings, which left U.S. facilities on the border under-resourced and overwhelmed. And for years they have ruled Baltimore as a one-party fiefdom as the city turned into an island of despair amid a sea of prosperity.

The tragedy of Trump's presidency is that he should be championing the people of Baltimore rather than using their plight to attack one of his critics.

Texto completo: It was arguably the line of the night. And in case you happened to miss it, Sen. Elizabeth Warren wanted to make sure she emphasized its significance, so she tweeted it after.
"I genuinely do not understand why anyone would go to all the trouble of running for president just to get up on this stage and talk about what's not possible." Warren delivered the line, to huge applause, well into the first night of the Democratic debates on CNN, after taking some pretty serious incoming from a number of her more moderate opponents.
Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, making his first debate appearance and boasting of his red-state electability, referred to some of Warren and Bernie Sanders' progressive proposals as "wish-list economics."
Former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper argued that the guarantee of a government job in the progressive-backed Green New Deal "is a disaster at the ballot box," warning, "You might as well FedEx the election to Donald Trump."
Former Maryland Rep. John Delaney pounded the progressives for "fairy-tale" ideas like Medicare for All, saying, "We don't have to go around and be the party of subtraction, and telling half the country who has private health insurance that their health insurance is illegal." Likewise, Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan scolded Warren and Sanders for "taking private health insurance away from union members in the industrial Midwest," decriminalizing the border, giving health insurance to undocumented workers and ignoring "working-class issues," those most important to "the people that take a shower after work who haven't had a raise in 30 years."
In other words, the moderates fought back on Tuesday night. But, as she's wont to do, Warren had a plan for that, which was, essentially, to call them all scaredy-cats.
Early on, she called out her Democratic opponents who have refused to follow her and Sanders on their far-left crusade. "We're not going to solve the urgent problems that we face with small ideas and spinelessness," she reprimanded. She chided them for lacking the political will to fight for big ideas, to think as boldly as she was, and for worrying about little things like electability. She may as well have said to Ryan, Delaney, Bullock and Hickenlooper, "Where's your manhood?"
But while it may have made for good theater, the line — questioning why anyone would go to the trouble of running just to talk about what they can't do — also highlights the central dilemma for the Democratic field. Do they just want to run or do they want to win? It's worth noting, however obvious, that the point of going to all the trouble of running is still, in the end, about winning the damn thing. It's about beating Donald Trump and ending his reign of division, fearmongering, otherism and bigotry.
The stakes are high, and he'll be hard to defeat. Candidates who are asking whether certain policies are too far left, unpopular, impractical and unelectable aren't weak or impotent; they're strategic and realistic. (Never mind the question of whether particular policies can then get through a Congress that's likely to be divided if they manage to win; remember, the Affordable Care Act barely squeaked through.)
Many on the left are worried that Warren and Sanders are pulling the field too far just for the sake of progressive bragging rights. Thomas Friedman in The New York Times pleaded with Democrats, writing "Please, spare me the revolution! It can wait. Win the presidency, hold the House and narrow the spread in the Senate, and a lot of good things still can be accomplished."
Hickenlooper reminded debate watchers that many of the progressive policies Warren and Sanders are proposing were not supported by the moderate Democrats who helped flip the House in 2018. Maybe for Warren, they just weren't brave enough or macho enough to run on really big ideas — but at least they got the win.
My colleague Van Jones tried to frame it in less goading terms than Warren. "For progressives, electrifying ideas = electability. Why can't we be audacious? Why can't we fight for what we believe in?" he tweeted after the debate.
Progressives can be audacious, but it comes with consequences. See FDR and his losing proposal to stack the courts. See the 1994 assault weapons ban, after which Democrats promptly lost 54 House seats. See George W. Bush's Iraq war. All that audacity proved perilous for their parties.
President Obama, for all the criticism from conservatives that he would turn America into a socialist dystopia, understood the value of incrementalism, whether on health care, immigration, gun control or myriad other issues. Many Democrats bemoan his caution, but his lack of audacity probably helped him get elected, twice.
Warren is an effective bully. Inciting and provoking her opponents to man up and stop whining about what isn't realistic will play well to the progressive base. It may even convince some Democrats that playing it smart is just playing it safe. But asking whether ideas are unwinnable isn't a sign of timidity or impotence; it's actually the whole ball game.

Susan Collins backs election security bill that's likely doomed by GOP opposition

Texto completo: AUGUSTA, Maine -- U.S. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine is the first Republican to sign a bill aimed at improving election security, but it's one of a handful of Democratic measures on that topic that have been blocked by her party so far and are unlikely to proceed to votes.
Collins announced Tuesday that she became a co-sponsor of the so-called "FIRE Act," which would require presidential campaigns contacted by foreign national offering campaign contributions, information or services to report those contacts to the FBI and election regulators.
The measure was introduced in May by Sen. Mark Warner, D-Virginia, as a response to special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian interference in the 2016 election. The New York Times identified at least 140 contacts mentioned in the report between President Donald Trump's campaign associates and Russian nationals or Wikileaks, the site that published hacked emails from Democrats during the race.
Collins didn't mention the Republican president in a statement on the measure, backing up the conclusions of Mueller and the U.S. intelligence community by saying that Russia's attempts to interfere in elections here "remain relentless" and she was "proud" to join Warner to push for it.
Despite Collins' support, the bill is still unlikely to pass in the Republican-controlled Senate because it is a direct rebuke to Trump. It is also among a handful of Democratic bills aimed at election security that have been blocked from votes by Republicans in the upper chamber.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, has long said that election management should be left to states and not the federal government. He has argued more recently that the federal government has responded adequately to the threat of Russian interference.
In a floor speech on Monday, he said that the Democratic measures have been blocked because they don't have bipartisan support. They also include a measure to require paper ballots in federal elections and authorize millions in grants to states to secure election systems that got one Republican vote but passed the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives.
"This kind of objection is a routine occurrence in the Senate," McConnell said in a Monday floor speech. "It doesn't make Republicans traitors or un-American. It makes us policymakers with a different opinion."
All of this could make Collins' move largely symbolic. Her sponsorship comes as Maine's senior senator faces a race for a fifth term in 2020 that is heavily targeted by national Democrats and just ahead of the Senate's recess from early August to early September.
On Wednesday, Collins spokeswoman Annie Clark that her boss "will work to encourage her colleagues in both parties" to support the Warner-sponsored measure.

Texto completo: Nancy Hiller's dream had finally come true.
It was Feburary 2007, and she'd taken out a loan to stock the shelves of Movie Mania, a video store tucked into a strip mall off of North Harrison Avenue in Pierre.
"I always wanted to work at a video store," she said. And after working at one for four years, her dream was realized with Movie Mania.
At the time there was competition — three other video stores were in town, and both Redbox and Netflix offered alternative video rental options, but Hiller had no idea what was coming.
Today, she's running the last remaining video store in South Dakota.
The same month Hiller opened Movie Mania, Netflix rolled out its first movie and TV streaming service with about 1,000 titles available. But at the time, the company seemed to doubt its potential.
"Yet even as he touts the benefits of his own service," a 2007 New York Times article reads, "Mr. Hastings does not believe that electronic distribution, be it through downloads or streaming services, is ready for prime time."
"The market is microscopic," Hastings is quoted as saying. "DVD is going to be a very big market for a very long time."
Fast forward 12 years, and Movia Mania is the state's last video store standing.
"It's a tough business," Hiller said. "It really is."
How Movie Mania was the last store standing At the start of 2019, there were still other stores in the state. But Video Plus in Dell Rapids closed in March. Mr. Movies in Rapid City announced that movie rentals had ceased earlier this month, and they'll close sometime in August after selling off their stock.
Even Aberdeen's Party Central — which had been Northview Video until 2007 when the store pivoted to selling party supplies, while also continuing to keep a small stock of movies available — closed in May when the owners retired.
Hiller says she's stayed afloat due to a number of factors — a considerable one being that she's never paid herself.
It's a family business — her husband Steven works with her, and her sister volunteered for a while as well. And Hiller herself also has a job with the state.
"If this was my sole job," she said, "we wouldn't still be here."
That doesn't mean they haven't tried to change with the times. They open at noon now instead of 10 a.m. Hardly anyone rents video games anymore, so unless a new Call of Duty or Grand Theft Auto comes out, Hiller doesn't buy it.
Most of all, they're selling anything and everything that people will buy: wallets, purses, hats, coffee from Rapid City.
"If we have a space to sell something, we have something in that space," Hiller said. "You try and bring what somebody else in town doesn't have."
It's the same attitude she brings to her competition with streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, Redbox and the rest.
At Movie Mania, she says, she gets to recommend movies to people. She gets to help them think of that movie from the '80s they want to show their kids. She gets to watch those same kids excitedly choose their own movie that they want to rent.
"There's something about going up and picking up a case," she said, "and being able to read about it and not standing in front of a machine."
'I don't want to let the dream die' Hiller knows it's surprising that she subscribes to the service that's draining the life from the industry she dreamed of joining.
She held off for a while, she said, but two years ago she decided she should be paying more attention to the competition. So she got a Netflix subscription.
"I don't watch a lot of stuff on there now," she said. It's not a principled decision — she just doesn't like much of what's offered.
The Netflix of 12 years ago was much different than what it is today, but Hiller said she knew pretty early that streaming was going to be a big deal.
"It was too convenient," she said. "I know how people are."
With more and more streaming services asking people for money and offering their own unique content, there's a part of Hiller that thinks the future might not be all bad.
"I think eventually when people are tired of having to pay Disney, Netflix, ABC, CBS, they're going to come looking for that one-stop place," she said. "And I hope we're still here."
But there's another part of Hiller, the part that knows that maybe her dream just came true at the worst possible time.
"If I could do it all over again, I wouldn't open it up," she said. "I didn't know streaming would be so huge. People don't like to leave their house. You don't have to get out and interact with people, which is sad."
She's a member of a Facebook group where video store owners chat, and she's seen plenty of them announce their closure.
"People miss these businesses when they're gone, they talk about it on social media," she said. "Okay, well, where were you guys before this was happening?"
All of that, combined with the knowledge that Movie Mania missed the golden years of video stores by just a bit, is heartbreaking.
"It's devastating," Hiller said. "Who wants to have a dream and have it get crushed?"
But the store's still open, and new releases keep coming in. She's got less time now, but she still watches as many as she can.
As long as people walk into Movie Mania because it's time for their kid to watch The Breakfast Club or because there's something that just isn't streaming anywhere, Hiller wants to be there.
As she talks, "Shazam!" is playing in the background. Hiller thanks a customer as they walk out the door.
"I hope they don't completely go away," she says. "I'll try everything I can to stay open because I don't want to let the dream die."

Denying Sexual Assault, General Gains the Support Of Two Prominent Women

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- With the female accuser looking on, two prominent women on Tuesday exerted their considerable influence on matters relating to sexual assault and the military, saying that they do not believe that President Trump's nominee for vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff sexually assaulted a subordinate multiple times in 2017.
Both Heather A. Wilson, the former Air Force secretary, and Senator Martha McSally, Republican of Arizona and a self-described survivor of sexual assault in the military, strongly and unequivocally defended Gen. John E. Hyten of the Air Force during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee.
Seated several rows behind the general was Col. Kathryn A. Spletstoser, a 28-year Army officer with four combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. In an interview last week with The New York Times, she described numerous instances of unwanted touching by the general, culminating in what she described as an assault in her hotel room in December 2017.
Air Force officials said an investigation found no evidence to corroborate Colonel Spletstoser's accusations. (Investigators also said they found no evidence that she lied.)
"Sexual assault happens in the military," Ms. McSally said. "It just didn't happen in this case." Ms. McSally -- who said this year that she had been raped when she was a cadet at the Air Force Academy -- also described the case against General Hyten as not even "a jump ball" or a "he said, she said" situation.
Ms. Wilson, a former Republican House member, was equally adamant. Introducing the general at the start of the hearing, and serving as a character witness for him, she declared that "General Hyten was falsely accused, and this matter should be set aside as you consider this nomination."
She then suggested that Colonel Spletstoser, who is still on active duty in the Army, "is a wounded soldier who believes what she is saying is true even if it is not."
Colonel Spletstoser said she found the assertions of the two women devastating. Of Ms. Wilson in particular, Colonel Spletstoser said she was "disgusted and offended that she would insinuate that my combat service would make me a liar."
With a handful of exceptions, the people who spoke Tuesday -- Colonel Spletstoser said her offer to testify at the public hearing was declined -- made clear they believed General Hyten over his accuser. Ms. Wilson, Ms. McSally and others cited the Air Force investigation into the case, with its more than 1,000 pages of records and interviews with over 50 people.
Senator James M. Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma and the committee chairman, criticized the news media for writing about the colonel's account "with little regard to the truth," and indicated that he, too, believed General Hyten.
"This committee takes allegations of sexual assault very seriously," Mr. Inhofe said in his opening statement. "But this committee will not act on unproven allegations -- allegations that do not withstand the close scrutiny of the committee's process."
General Hyten, for his part, maintained that he never initiated sexual contact with Colonel Spletstoser.
"Nothing happened, ever," he said in his opening statement. He denied the assertions that the colonel described, including an episode on the night of Dec. 2, 2017, when she said General Hyten entered her hotel room and rubbed himself against her until he ejaculated.
But the general seemed to stumble when he sought to explain why he delayed acting on numerous complaints from military staff members that Colonel Spletstoser was "toxic" in dealings with others.
"You could not bring yourself to admit or recognize toxic leadership within your command," said Senator Joni Ernst, Republican of Iowa. "You continued to endorse her. You only did something about it when concerns were raised about your own leadership."
She added that "all of this suggests a conflict between your personal inclinations and your professional responsibilities."
General Hyten, who also highly praised Colonel Spletstoser in her performance reviews, and advocated on her behalf in emails to other top officials despite the complaints about her, said: "You've got to understand she was brilliant. She did spectacular work."
With his wife and family seated behind him, the general repeatedly presented himself as someone who cared deeply about sexual assault claims in the military. He promised that if he became vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the second-highest military position in the country, he would work assiduously to eradicate what he called the "scourge" of sexual assault in the Defense Department.
But pressed several times for specifics on how he would do so, he said he was unsure and would ask people for help. "I know a lot about space and cyber," he said. "But I'm not an expert on sexual assault."
The Defense Department has been struggling for years to deal with sexual assault in military ranks, and the Pentagon's own statistics show the problem is worsening.
In May, the Defense Department estimated that the number of sexual assaults climbed nearly 38 percent in 2018, compared with two years earlier. Senior military leaders, who want to retain control of the issue, continue to insist that they are working to raise awareness and accountability.
"You can't come up with any ideas?" asked Senator Tammy Duckworth, Democrat of Illinois and an Iraq war veteran. "I worry about your leadership on this issue."
Ms. Duckworth also noted that General Hyten's cellphone, issued by the Defense Department, was wiped of most of its data during the time of the alleged episodes.
"I was not aware it was wiped," General Hyten said. "To me, it's just an unclassified phone."
While most of the Republicans on the committee praised the general during the hearing, he appeared to have some support from Democrats as well.
Senator Doug Jones, Democrat of Alabama, singled out Ms. Wilson's defense of the general as something with which he agreed. And several other Democrats were largely muted in their questions about sexual assault and instead asked about military policy.
Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, had only one question for General Hyten related to the allegations, asking whether he agreed that "if the allegations of sexual assault leveled against you were true, they would be disqualifying?"
General Hyten replied, "Yes." Mr. Kaine then moved on to questions about the Law of the Sea convention, an arcane treaty that governs maritime relations.
Advocates of victims of sexual assault criticized the process, noting that Colonel Spletstoser was not allowed to present her case publicly before the committee. (She privately testified before committee members last week, as did General Hyten.)
"The fix is in to elevate Gen. John E. Hyten," Toni Van Pelt, the president of the National Organization for Women, said in a statement, "despite credible accusations of sexual assault made by an officer under his command." She called on the committee to allow Colonel Spletstoser to testify publicly.
Another of Colonel Spletstoser's former bosses stepped forward to praise her.
"I think she's honest as the day is long," said David T. Johnson, a former assistant secretary of state for international narcotics and law enforcement affairs.
In an interview, Mr. Johnson said Colonel Spletstoser worked for him 10 years ago when she was detailed by the Pentagon to be his special assistant during multiple trips, including to Afghanistan and Pakistan.
"I never saw anything at all that would cause me to question her integrity, and that is important in diplomacy," he said.
One congressional staffer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that the comments by Ms. McSally all but assured that General Hyten would be confirmed.

Texto completo: The offer seemed too good to be true: a three-day cruise to the Bahamas for $129. At a minimum, that's room, meals and transit abroad for about the price of an average hotel room.
Budget cruises abound in the ever-growing industry, where 18 new ships are expected to launch this year, according to the Cruise Lines International Association. Based at the Port of Palm Beach, Bahamas Paradise Cruise Line operates a pair of ships that go back and forth to Freeport on Grand Bahama Island, about 90 miles away, year round.
I booked a $129 sailing on the 1,680-guest Grand Classica, formerly the Costa neoClassica, launched by the Italian line Costa Cruises in 1991, repurposed in 2018 (double-occupancy rates currently run from $99 a person for an interior cabin to $459 a person for a suite). With tax and fees, the bill was about $210, still a good value provided the ship was clean, the food edible, the resort amenities diverting. I embarked in late May to find out.
Embarkation Gantlet
Most cruises from Florida depart from Miami, Fort Lauderdale or Port Canaveral, each accessible from a major airport. Palm Beach offers fewer flights, but the cruise line's website suggested getting tickets aboard the new Brightline train from $10 for the 43-minute trip between Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach.
The sleek, snub-nosed trains operate from modern downtown stations that allowed me to conduct my own pre- and post-cruise shore excursions on foot, with the occasional assist by free trolley (West Palm Beach) and free Freebee electric shuttle (Fort Lauderdale). From the West Palm station, it was a 10-minute Uber ride to the ship.
The Resort at Sea
Having taken bargain cruises, I was prepared for a tiny, interior, window-less room. Instead, exterior cabin 6126 had a large porthole window next to a small table and two chairs, a queen bed, mini refrigerator and relatively spacious bathroom with a curtained shower. Internet access cost $15 for 24 hours.
Up four floors, past the Tuscan landscape art that betrays the ship's origins, there's a fully equipped gym that in two days of use I shared only once, with a staff dancer. It is part of the spa, offering a range of treatments from $20 brow shaping to 75-minute Balinese massages for $180.
At the 5 p.m. sail-away party by the aptly named Plunge Pool (there's also a small adults-only pool), entertainers led passengers in a conga line and the Macarena. The ship comedian, Vince Taylor, reminded the crowd, "Remember, what happens on the cruise stays on Facebook!"
At the bar, I ordered a Bahamian Sands beer ($6.50) and met a multigenerational family from Georgia celebrating a daughter's graduation from medical school; a Colombian mother and daughter who praised the trip as "mas economico" compared with alternatives; and young couples across the racial spectrum cruising for the first time.
My fellow passengers were also far younger than the 50-plus set that tend to dominate longer cruises. The company says its core demographic is 25 to 45.
Some took the cruise to gamble in the ship's casino. Others combined it with an island resort stay, getting off for a few days before returning (the cruise line sells ship and hotel packages). At dinner - a light "Floribbean" meal of shrimp cocktail and seared tuna nicoise salad - I met Kathleen Young from Central Florida, who uses the ship monthly to avoid flying on a small plane to the island, where she was receiving treatment for cancer.
"They practically pay me to cruise," she said, enumerating her $129 booking, including 10 free drink tickets and a $50 shipboard credit, perks that are often included in sales (my package included both, but until I met Kathleen I didn't realize you have to ask for the drink tickets at the bar, as they were not distributed at check-in).
Kathleen introduced me to many secrets of the cruise, including the seated breakfast in the dining room unknown to buffetgoers, using drink coupons to buy 1.5-liter bottles of water (the ship prohibits bringing your own) and hitting the lounge to catch Sax and Songs, made up of a saxophone player and an R&B singer.
She insisted on sitting in the front row for the nightly Las Vegas-style musical review performed by a cast of 10 talented singers, dancers and aerialists and carried on at the late-night Latin dance party when I called it a day. Most of the entertainment was free, except Taylor's hilarious, R-rated stand-up show, which cost $9 for two tickets during a two-for-one sale.
Going Ashore
"Who wants to go to the No. 1 party beach on the island?" bellowed our bus driver on a Best of Grand Bahana shore excursion after we docked on the second day.
Not me, but it was too late. I'd already signed us for the trip with Bahamas Adventures ($52). My intended excursion, to bike around the island ($89), was canceled for low enrolment. The "best" island itnerary involved two shopping stops and a nature center followed by an over crowded beach club blaring Miley Cyrus' "Party in the USA."
The happiest passengers back on the Classica had taken one of the beach excursions ($39 to $83) for a long day of uncomplcated sunning and swimming.
On the bus ride back to the ship, a CarnivalFreedom guest asked me if Bahamas Paradise was life Carnival. "Not exactly," said, and when our ship pulled out that evening, I could see how right I was: The Freedom had a ship-top bisketball court, water slides and a giant screen beside the pool.
For $129, you give up such ship amenities For the most part, the shipfrees you to sunbathe, read and, of course, party. It's a good value, and value was that talk of the ship, on board and off.
"Can you believe that ship's going through the Panama Canal," said the immigration officer back in Palm Beach as I disembarked, mentionting a coming nine-night cruse. "Only 500 bucks."

Texto completo: President Donald Trump doesn't plan to win reelection. He is skillfully planning to have the Democrats lose the election, thereby he wins by default.
His strategy is becoming clear. By attacking the far-left "squad" he is forcing Democrats to rally around them, and by implication making a far-left candidate his opponent. Notice that Trump has slacked off criticizing Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a leader who appears to know what Trump is doing and shares his belief that any far-left Democrat will lose in 2020.
She will lose massive support among upper-, middle-, and working-class voters. Pelosi is fully aware that pledging to wipe out private health insurance with Medicare for all, huge tax increases to pay for that program and free college education, and a flood of immigrants crossing our border will disaffect and turn off millions of voters.
Playing the impeachment card, as the far-left wants, will play into Trump's game plan. It will rally his fervent supporters, captivate the media which he plays so well, and paralyze government which can be blamed on the Democratic impeachment imbroglio. Pelosi has more than hinted that a moderate liberal Joe Biden would be the Democrats' strongest candidate.
Trump's thought process probably went like this:
I attacked Joe Biden and the Democratic regulars rallied to his side and his poll numbers stayed at the top. He is my most formidable opponent, gathering all those Dems, moderate independents, and all the moderate, educated Republican men and women, especially broads I have teed off.
He can also dig into my white working-class base with his dinner pail Joe stuff. He's big in Pennsylvania. Not good. Bad!
I want to run against a far-left crazy socialist. So, I will shift and attack them, starting with the squad: Anastasia Oprah Cortex or whatever her name is and her three socialist buddies. I'll focus on their front-runner later. Oh, it will be a big media show I can't lose. Every day, day after day, nonstop.
I will select the right, oops far-left, Democratic nominee that will lose. Best of all, I will split the Democratic Party worse than I did in 2016. Ah, Hillary, lock her up Hillary, so incompetent! She believed the polls and the New York Times and thought it was in the bag until too late. She had a million policy proposals, none of which captured the white working class or evangelicals, much less anyone in the South. Worst of all for her, Clinton didn't play the media as I did; didn't have a theme, nothing as good as my "Make America Great Again" Populist nationalism conquered and rallied my base, especially in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Those were the key electoral votes. Let her focus on the elitist big states like New York and California. I took the rest even with the fewer national votes. She thought she was above me and everyday Americans. Loved it. Give me the flag-waving masses any day.
Maybe I have over-intellectualized Trump's thinking. Probably not. He holds and mesmerizes mass rallies just like some of his models did on their path to power.
Clearly Trump is counting on and encouraging Democratic disarray, something the GOP doesn't suffer from (although recently it has shown some cracks). Many remember Will Rogers' witty remark: "I'm not a member of an organized party; I'm a Democrat."
He is also counting on the media, and not only on Fox. They love him for his antics and sensitive to his charge that they produce "fake news." So they cover what he says and does professionally, straight. Their commentary blabs only to those who already favor it, not the heartland, not those wedded to Fox and talk radio. Trump loves that polarization.
So does his party - yes, the Republican Party is his party.

Texto completo: The Republican commander in chief arrived on his presidential yacht as U.S. battleships fired their guns in a salute that lasted a full five minutes.
President Theodore Roosevelt had sailed to Norfolk on April 26, 1907, to celebrate the first English colonists to establish a permanent settlement at Jamestown. It was the opening day of the Jamestown Exposition, honoring the 300th anniversary of the arrival of three ships led by Capt. Christopher Newport in 1607.
On Tuesday, President Trump will travel to Jamestown to give a speech marking the 400th anniversary of the first meeting of a representative legislature in the future United States.
Trump's address to a special commemorative session of the Virginia General Assembly will no doubt attract many supporters, but it will also draw protesters, just as the president's appearance on the Mall on the Fourth of July did. Many of the state's Democratic political leaders said they will boycott the Trump talk.
There were no protesters when Roosevelt arrived 112 years ago.
At 8:30 a.m., Roosevelt's presidential yacht, the Mayflower, "appeared out of the north, skimmed across the shining blue and threaded her way through the lanes" of 50 U.S. and foreign battleships, The Washington Post reported.
The ships' guns fired their salute. "At last the smoke cleared away, and the President was perceived - on the deck of the Mayflower - his high hat in hand and his frock coat flapping in the breeze," the Philadelphia Inquirer said. Admirals arrived at the yacht to greet the president.
As Roosevelt stepped from the gangplank to go ashore, the head of the exposition greeted him. "Welcome to Old Virginia," he said to the 46-year-old Roosevelt, who responded: "I'm glad to be here. It's bully."
A crowd generally estimated at about 40,000 people turned out for the opening of the exposition, which resembled a World's Fair. The site stretched over 340 acres of grounds and water. At least 37 foreign nations were represented, as well as the U.S. government. Scores of American companies and more than 20 states planned to construct exhibition buildings. Pennsylvania, for example, wanted to build a replica of Independence Hall. There was a "War Path" amusement park, a Wild West show and a re-creation of the San Francisco earthquake. The cost of admission was 50 cents for adults and 25 cents for children.
Though the purpose of the day was to celebrate American history, Roosevelt clearly "was the magnet" for the men, women and children in the crowd, who "shouted cheers for him, and their legs did valiant service in hustling them here and there, wherever they might get a glimpse of him," The Post said.
The newspaper also reported: "Every other man in the crowd called the President 'Teddy' and laughed." And "the President vigorously shook his head and grinned."
Roosevelt's appearance drew a bevy of dignitaries. They included most of his Cabinet members, more than 100 members of Congress from both parties, governors, mayors, more than 100 diplomats and 150 reporters, plus 5,000 soldiers and 1,500 sailors.
The president was scheduled to deliver his speech at noon from an awning-covered stage in an open square. It was a hot day with a brisk southeasterly breeze. Numerous officials and diplomats sat behind Roosevelt. The president shook his finger at the French ambassador and told him to put on his hat. "I won't have you suffer a sunstroke," he joked.
The crowd roared as Roosevelt rose to speak. Suddenly, people in the back began pressing forward, threatening to trample the people at the front. Sensing a disaster, Roosevelt - "with the agility of a school boy" - suddenly leaped on top of a small table that had been placed on the speaker's stand.
"I have always known," he said, "that you gentlemen of Virginia were noted for protecting your women and children. Now let me see the proof. By pressing forward someone may be killed."
The crowd calmed down.
Roosevelt's lengthy speech rang with modern-day themes. "At the moment the greatest problem before us is how to exercise such control over the business use of vast wealth, individual, but especially corporate, as will ensure its not being used against the interest of the public, while yet permitting such ample legitimate profits as will encourage individual initiative," he said.
Immigration was another theme. "All through the Colonial days, new waves of immigrants from time to time swept hither across the ocean, now from one country, now from another," he said. And "each group of newcomers, as it adds its blood to the life, also changes it somewhat, and this change and growth and development have gone on steadily, generation by generation throughout three centuries."
The crowd responded to the speech with "constant outbursts of applause and cheering," the New York Tribune reported.
Then came the big moment for the president to officially open the exposition, by pressing a golden electric button that, as one newspaper reported, "will start in motion the thousand wheels in the Exposition." Roosevelt pressed the button as a thousand flags unfurled, cannon shots roared and bands played "America." When he did, however, one South Carolina man in the audience was heard to say, "I've been lookin' around some, but I declare I can't see just what wheels are being set in motion."
He was right. There were precious few mechanical wheels to set in motion.
After five years in planning, the exposition was far behind schedule and dogged by financial problems. Only a third of the buildings were completed, just 20 percent of the lights could be turned on, and many exhibits, such as the amusement section, were not ready to go.
The energetic Roosevelt was unperturbed. He headed for a presidential luncheon at the exposition's administration building. He returned to the square to review a military parade and then attended two receptions. The next day, on his way back to Washington on his yacht, the president stopped at Jamestown Island.
The exposition continued through November. Other visiting celebrities included African American educator Booker T. Washington and author Mark Twain, who rode in on a steam yacht owned by a Standard Oil magnate. Roosevelt returned in June on Georgia Day to visit the state's building, a reproduction of his mother's family home in Roswell, Ga.
But attendance was far below expectations, and the exposition ended deep in the red. The New York Times dubbed it "the most colossal failure in the history of exhibitions."

An aid package of their own

Texto completo: The 300 toothbrushes proved too much for Margaret Dimond.
She stopped what she was doing: sorting through heaps of donated supplies meant for migrant families detained at the U.S.-Mexico border. Standing in a friend's living room in Potomac, Md., on Thursday, Dimond lifted the lumpy plastic bag above her head and launched into a "happy dance."
"Wow!" she exclaimed, when she finished pumping her arms, shaking her head and stomping her feet. "Doesn't that make you want to cry? Three hundred toothbrushes at one go!"
The half-dozen women around her smiled and laughed - but then all of them quickly got back to work. For good reason: They faced mountains of diapers, fluffy gray towels, multicolored bedsheets, even a small mound of Kleenex tissue packets.
The team of volunteers carefully organized the items: backpacks by the staircase, face wipes on the couch, toothpaste near the piano. They helped Dimond, 53, and Jordana Carmel, 55, load the haul into both of their cars so the two women could take it to a rented storage unit in nearby Kensington.
Soon, Dimond and Carmel will take a much longer drive. In early August, they will pack all they've gathered into a rented truck and drive 20 hours to Laredo, Tex. They will give the supplies to Catholic Charities of the Diocese of Laredo, which will distribute them to individuals and families released from U.S. Customs and Border Protection detention facilities.
Congress approved a $4.6 billion border aid package in June meant to improve poor conditions at detention centers, which government watchdog groups have decried as overcrowded and unsanitary. Several children have died in federal custody at the border over the past year.
"Our hope is to provide the necessities to help these people feel human again," Dimond said.
She came up with the idea at 1 a.m. late last month. Dimond, who works out of her Rockville home as an Internet and technology consultant, had just wrapped up the day's assignments. She was about to fall asleep when she spotted a New York Times headline on her iPad: " 'There Is a Stench': Soiled Clothes and No Baths for Migrant Children at a Texas Center."
The word "stench" was arresting.
"So I read the article, and beyond the thought of the horrible conditions, I just thought, 'This is so solvable!' " Dimond said. "There's a need that can be met."
It was too late to do anything that night. So Dimond set her alarm for 6 a.m. and - after imbibing "significant amounts" of coffee - sketched out an action plan in brown ink on a white legal pad. Her mission was clear: to deliver toiletries, clothes and other hygiene items to incarcerated migrant families and children. But how?
First up, research and outreach. Over the next few weeks, Dimond read everything related to detention centers that she could find online - especially useful, she said, were small Texas-based news outlets. She also contacted lawyers and nonprofit organizations working along the border to discuss what was needed and what was possible.
Soon, Dimond began zeroing in on Catholic Charities-Diocese of Laredo (CCDOL). Benjamin de la Garza, executive director of the nonprofit social services agency, said CCDOL has seen about 70 people exiting detention centers every day over the past month, though the number can sometimes rise above 200. Border Patrol agents direct families approved for release to the Catholic Charities shelter, where staff members care for them and help them find a place to stay as they await immigration hearings.
"These people come to us in need of showers, in need of personal hygiene, in need of clothes, in need of food - they even have medical needs sometimes," de la Garza said.
He added that efforts such as Dimond's are vital. "Without donations and support from all over the U.S., it would be very hard for us to sustain this crisis," he said.
As she gained a clearer understanding of the situation at the border, Dimond - drawing on her background in coding - whipped up a website detailing her project. She also reached out to family, friends, current and former clients, people from past professional lives - anyone and everyone she thought might be able to help. Everybody was more than willing to pitch in, often by donating items such as shampoo and hairbrushes.
One of the people she contacted was Jordana Carmel, a longtime friend and her former yoga instructor.
Carmel, who works as a life and health coach and massage therapist in addition to teaching yoga, was feeling "deeply depressed" by news reports about the detention centers, she said. She often sat in her car and wept as she listened to radio updates from the border. The dilemma made Carmel think of her 100-year-old grandmother, a Holocaust survivor, who immigrated to the United States from Germany during World War II.
"We must all remember where we came from," Carmel said. "None of us are that far removed from the moment of immigration."
Carmel, who wanted to help migrant families but had no idea how, was thrilled to hear from Dimond. She signed on to co-lead the project almost immediately.
"Well, actually, I just didn't give her a choice," Carmel said. "It became a 'we' without us ever discussing it."
About the same time Dimond and Carmel joined forces, the two women also connected with KindWorks, a Maryland-based nonprofit organization that collaborates with other organizations and government agencies to engage D.C.-area residents in community service. Carmel found Deb Lang, the executive director of KindWorks, through a former massage client. With that, the twosome morphed into a trio. Lang is on the phone with Dimond and Carmel every day and helps with "whatever comes up," she said.
Once they started using KindWorks' web of contacts and resources - and publicizing their collection effort on social media and over neighborhood email lists - the three women found themselves deluged with supplies, offers of help and money.
"That's what KindWorks does - we take someone with an idea, like Margaret, and we blow it up," said Lang, who hosted Thursday's sorting party at her Potomac home. It was the second such gathering that KindWorks has held.
Dimond, Carmel and Lang set up collection sites in homes, churches and synagogues across the region. All of these, whose addresses are listed on Dimond's and KindWorks' websites, will accept supplies until Wednesday. After consulting, in part, with CCDOL, the three women published a catalogue of the items most useful to migrants, including shoelaces, water bottles, deodorant and baby formula.
They also rented a storage unit. Until then, Dimond had kept the supplies in her home. As of Thursday, the 15-by-30-foot storage room was about one-third full. The rows of shampoo and stacks of blankets will remain there until Aug. 8, when Dimond and Carmel - and possibly Lang, who's still deciding - will embark on their road trip.
In addition to Laredo, the women will visit the Texas cities of McAllen and Brownsville. They expect the tour to take about five days. All costs will be covered by donations. Dimond and Carmel haven't checked the amount of money sent in so far but said they think it will be sufficient.
Both women have driven trucks before, so neither is nervous, they said. Nor do they feel so hopeless when they read news from the border anymore. Instead, Dimond, Carmel and Lang wake up most mornings feeling "amazed" and "inspired" by D.C.-area residents' "overwhelming response" to their project, Carmel said.
One such resident is Mariam Afzal, 37, who drove from her home in McLean to drop off a car's worth of supplies at Lang's house on Thursday morning. Afzal's family immigrated to the United States as refugees from war-torn Afghanistan when she was 9 months old.
"It is a very personal thing to be able to help with this," Afzal said, noting her refugee status. "But no matter who you are, all human beings should have dignity."
She shrugged. "That's really all there is to it."

Texto completo: El mes pasado, Steven Romero celebró su sexto cumpleaños en Legoland en California. El domingo por la tarde, fue asesinado a tiros en el Festival del Ajo Gilroy en el norte de California.
En total, tres personas murieron y 13 resultaron heridas en el tiroteo , dijeron las autoridades. Se desconocen las identidades de las otras dos víctimas.
La policía disparó en apenas un minuto y mató al sospechoso que portaba un rifle de asalto, según un comunicado de la ciudad de Gilroy. Este lunes el atacante fue identificado como Santino William Legan . Se desconocen los motivos del crimen.
“No hay nada que realmente pueda hacer, además de tratar de estar con él hasta que pueda colocarlo en su lugar de descanso”, dijo el padre de Steven, Alberto Romero, a NBC Bay Area.
“Mi hijo tenía toda la vida por vivir y solo tenía seis años. Esto es todo lo que puedo decir.”
Romero estaba en casa con su hija de 9 años cuando se enteró del tiroteo. Steven había ido al festival con su madre y su abuela, que también resultaron heridas.
Romero dijo que la madre de Steven recibió dos disparos en la mano y cree que la abuela recibió un disparo en la pierna.
“Ojalá que detengan a los atacantes”, dijo Romero.
Justo después del tiroteo, Romero publicó una foto de Steven en Legoland, pidiendo a la gente que dé información sobre el tiroteo. Su cuenta ahora es privada.
Describió a su hijo como un niño enérgico que acababa de graduarse de la guardería y estaba a solo unas semanas de ingresar al primer grado.
Estaba “siempre feliz y siempre queriendo divertirse”, dijo Romero, mientras mostraba fotos del pequeño.
Entre los heridos estaba Lesley Sánchez, de 15 años, una porrista de la escuela secundaria Gilroy que estaba como voluntaria en el festival , según informaron miembros de la familia a The New York Times. Le dispararon en la cadera, pero pudo recibir visitas en su habitación del hospital el domingo por la noche, dijeron.
Julissa Contreras, una testigo que dijo que era una ex cadete de la policía, dijo en una entrevista el domingo por la noche que vio a “tu hombre blanco promedio” disparando lo que parecía ser un rifle semiautomático, “simplemente yendo de izquierda a derecha y disparando a quienquiera que podía, honestamente “.
“Definitivamente disparó más de 30 rondas”, dijo. “Fue como ininterrumpido, con dos, tres, cuatro disparos por segundo”.
Contreras describió al hombre como de unos 30 años, vestido con una gorra, gafas de sol deportivas y lo que parecía ropa de estilo militar.
“Parecía que podría trabajar en seguridad privada”, dijo. “Pero tenía como correas y clips, y estaba completamente preparado para lo que estaba haciendo. Absolutamente”.
Gilroy se encuentra a unos 30 kilómetros al sur de San José. El tiroteo tuvo lugar durante el Festival del Ajo Gilroy, un evento anual de tres días en Christmas Hill Park. Gilroy, de aproximadamente 60,000 habitantes, es un importante productor de ajo y hogar de trabajadores agrícolas y personas que se desplazan a empleos de tecnología.

Texto completo: What's on TV
LIGHTS OUT WITH DAVID SPADE 11:30 p.m. on Comedy Central. If you were wondering, "What ever happened to David Spade after 'Joe Dirt?"' You're in luck. The comedy veteran debuts a new show described in a recent New York Times article by Dave Itzkoff as "a comic round-table where Spade and a rotating cast of stand-ups riff on popular culture and internet memes." Though Spade has had a long career, this show, which will air immediately after "The Daily Show With Trevor Noah," has the potential to breathe new life into a comedian who rarely got top billing. Spade also joins "a late-night landscape oversaturated with political comedy," Itzkoff wrote. The show's creators, he added, "believe they can further differentiate themselves by staying away from Trump-of-the-day jokes."
THE BRADY BUNCH MOVIE (1995) 9 p.m. on HDNet Movies. The theme song to the 1970s sitcom based on this movie might be one of the most recognizable in American television history. The Bradys in the film adaptation of the popular series, however, are not made up of the original actors many know and love (Florence Henderson does appear in the film, though not as Carol Brady). The family members are like fish out of water as they attempt to navigate the 1990s. The movie "stresses contrasts between squeaky-clean Bradyisms and '90s grunge, thus prompting an uneasy mix of condescension and nostalgia," Janet Maslin wrote in a review of the film for The Times.
BOOTY CALL (1997) 9:30 p.m. on FLIX If a drama in the vein of Jamie Foxx's Oscar-winning performance "Ray" is what you're after, then maybe you should pass on this one. If, however, laughs and a bit of raunch is what you're craving, then this film fits the bill. In a 1997 review for the Times, Stephen Holden called the movie "Hollywood's first condom comedy." An accurate description, as Bunz (Foxx) and Rushon (Tommy Davidson), who are on a double date, spend the night trying to hunt down the contraceptive in order to take things to the next level with their partners. Holden described the comedy as "custom-made" for Foxx, adding that "the movie even finds a way for the popular television star to do his parodies of famous people."
What's Streaming
TWELVE FOREVER Stream on Netflix. "I'm just some weird loser, who's loud, awkward and still plays with toys," the 12-year-old main character Reggie said in the trailer for this new animated children's series. The show, created by Julia Vickerman, a writer and artist for "The Powerpuff Girls," centers on the life of Reggie and her awkward entry into adolescence (think bras, body changes and lots of angst). To escape the inevitable, Reggie uses her imagination to transport herself to a world where she can stay 12 forever.

A Reagan-Era Road Story, 29 Years in the Making

Texto completo: "Once the last bridge is burnt, every addict becomes an island, no matter what John Donne says," Peter Kaldheim writes in his new memoir, "Idiot Wind." It was in this state, cut off from the people who had been in his life and owing money to an intimidating drug dealer, that Kaldheim fled New York City in 1987. Inspired by Jack Kerouac, he traveled across the country by bus and in strangers' cars, writing short sketches about his experiences along the way. In "Idiot Wind," Kaldheim, now 70, recounts those travels as well as his time as a teenage seminary student and his years as an editor and aspiring writer before he left New York. Below, he talks about the book's very long gestation, the kindred spirit he sees in the singer Tom Waits and more.
When did you first get the idea to write this book?
Way back in 1987. At the time, I was staying at the Joyce Hotel, a skid row flophouse in Portland, Ore., where I'd landed after fleeing the mess I'd made of my life in Manhattan, thanks to a decade-long addiction to alcohol and cocaine.
By the time I reached Portland, after 18 days on the road, I had quite a fund of stories saved up. I shared some of them with my good friend Gerry Howard, a book editor back in New York. Gerry wrote to say how much he'd enjoyed my road sketches, and he was the first one to suggest that I expand them into a memoir. So that's where the idea came from, but it would take another 29 years for me to finish it.
The project stayed on the back burner from 1987 to 2002. Then I was working as a chef at Montana State University in Bozeman, and had just gotten divorced after a 13-year marriage. So I had the trailer to myself and plenty of free time. I started writing chapters, but I finally gave it up because I couldn't find the voice I wanted or the structure that seemed right for the material.
In 2012, I took early retirement and moved back to Long Island because I had two younger brothers who were in ill health, and I wanted to help them out. In July 2015, they both passed away from cancer within four days of each other. I really had no relatives or anyone left to share my grief with. A few months after they passed, I went to visit Gerry and his wife. I just unburdened myself, had a good cry and felt much better.
Gerry said, "So Peter, what's happening with your memoir? Maybe now would be a good time to get back into it." I went home and started looking at my original notebooks. The day after Thanksgiving that year, I sat down and decided I was going to start a completely new draft. Next thing I knew, I was turning out a chapter a month.
What's the most surprising thing you learned while writing it?
Writing a memoir requires just as much imagination as writing a novel. That was something I never expected. But now I can see why Siri Hustvedt says, "I have always believed that memory and the imagination are a single faculty." The stories I tell are all nonfiction accounts of my experiences, but shaping them into a unified narrative put my imagination to the test in ways I hadn't anticipated. And that was a pleasure to discover.
In what way is the book you wrote different than the book you set out to write?
The book I set out to write was, at its core, a road story set in Reagan-era America. As the writing progressed and I began to interweave episodes from my childhood into the narrative, it became clear to me that the story I was really telling wasn't just about my travels. It was also the story of the journey that all people who have lost their way must take if they want to find their way back to themselves.
I was surprised that I could muster the honesty to talk about some of the adolescent problems I encountered when I was a seminary student, mainly dealing with the strictures against masturbation, and with having to kneel in a confession box every Saturday, with the priests behind the screen being the same ones who taught you in class and knew your voice by heart. I didn't think I would have the guts to do that. But those early struggles turned out to be indicative of later struggles I had with impulse control.
Who is a creative person (not a writer) who has influenced you and your work?
Given the title of my memoir, I suppose the obvious answer would be Bob Dylan. But I'm going with another singer/songwriter: Tom Waits. I can't think of a single Dylan song that has ever made me cry, but Tom Waits has managed that feat in dozens of songs, dating back to 1973, when I discovered his music on the album "Closing Time."
As a young man, I was drawn to writers who put their struggles with alcohol and drugs at the center of their stories -- writers like Malcolm Lowry, Charles Bukowski and Frederick Exley. I suspect that's because I sensed that my own issues with impulse control would one day lead me down the same troubled road. So, when I started listening to Tom Waits, I knew right away I had fallen in with a kindred spirit. I love his moxie. I love his big heart. And I love his unrivaled gift for finding poetry in the broken dreams and disheveled lives of the characters in his songs. The man's got empathy in spades, and he's not ashamed to put it on display. Which is something I believe we should all aspire to.
Persuade someone to read "Idiot Wind" in 50 words or less.
If you've ever, even briefly, fantasized about abandoning your present life and hitting the road for parts unknown to make a fresh start elsewhere, you'll likely find this account of what happened to me when I dropped off the map illuminating -- and even, occasionally, comical.

Texto completo: Some Marylanders
demand forceful rebuke
after Baltimore slam
The outrage in Maryland over President Trump's attacks on Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) veered Sunday toward a new target: Republican Gov. Larry Hogan.
Hogan, a frequent Trump critic who considered challenging the president in the 2020 primary, delivered a muted response on Saturday to Trump's tweets, which Democrats and many Baltimore residents roundly condemned as a racist attack on African Americans in Maryland's largest city.
Trump described the district represented by Cummings, who as chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform has taken a lead role in investigating the president, as a "rodent infested mess" where "no human" would want to live. The longtime congressman's district includes about half of Baltimore City and most of the majority-black sections of Baltimore County.
In a statement delivered by his spokesman, Hogan said: "Baltimore City is truly the very heart of our state, and more attacks between politicians aren't going to get us anywhere."
On social media, where the Twitter hashtag #WeAreBaltimore was trending on Sunday, Hogan's critics called the governor "weak" and "gutless" for not delivering a forceful rebuke of the president.
"Where are you @LarryHogan?" wrote Frederick County resident Heather Hooper, 50, who uses the Twitter handle @Heathhooperstar. "As a long time tax paying constituent, I want to know."
Montgomery County resident Susan Leone, 73, whose Twitter handle is @susanbutterfly2, posted: "Where is our GOV. Hogan of Md. Why is he staying quiet. He should be speaking out on trump attack on Congressmen Cummings."
Hogan, who was elected chairman of the National Governors Association in Salt Lake City on Friday, was traveling Sunday and wasn't available for an interview, spokesman Michael Ricci said.
"The governor believes we need to be focused on solving problems and finding common ground rather than resorting to attacks," Ricci said in an email. He said Hogan will address Trump's words more fully on Monday.
Lt. Gov. Boyd K. Rutherford (R) directly chided Trump in his own statement on Saturday. "Mr. President @realDonaldTrump, I have substantial policy differences with Congressman @RepCummings," tweeted Rutherford, who is African American like Cummings. "However, I hope your criticism is not directed at the many good and hard working people who live in the district."
Since being elected in deep-blue Maryland in 2014, Hogan has cast himself as someone who takes principled stands - a "regular guy" who beat back cancer in 2015 and works across the partisan aisle to do what he thinks is best for the state's 6 million residents.
But the 63-year-old governor has also frequently lashed out at Democrats, especially in fights over spending priorities and taxes.
Earlier this month, Hogan joined a small group of other Republicans in condemning Trump's suggestion that four Democratic congresswomen of color - Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.), Ilhan Omar (Minn.), Rashida Tlaib (Mich.) and Ayanna Pressley (Mass.) - "go back" to the "corrupt" places they came from. All four are American citizens and only Omar was born outside the United States.
Hogan said those comments "were terrible and very unbecoming of a president. Totally inappropriate."
At other times, Hogan has avoided the fray.
In announcing in June that he would not challenge Trump for the Republican Party's 2020 presidential nomination, the governor said his decision was driven by his desire to govern without being pulled into an unpredictable political maelstrom that would keep him away from Annapolis.
"We need to have a bigger tent and find a way to get things done," Hogan said. "We need some civility and bipartisanship."
Hogan struck a moderate tone when accepting the chairmanship of the governors association. His first act, he announced, would be to launch a year-long initiative focused on fixing the nation's crumbling infrastructure. "One of the things that makes Americans so special is that when we see something that's broken, we fix it," he said in a video clip posted to his Twitter account. "Or, at least we try to."
Several commenters on that post, however, stayed focused on Baltimore.
"Are you going to accept this racist attack on Baltimore," asked one of them, @38robman. "Be a Leader and stand."
Amid the outrage over Trump's tweets, some pointed out Sunday that the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, owns thousands of apartments in the Baltimore area, in complexes that have been cited over the years for hundreds of code violations. According to an investigation by the New York Times and Pro Publica, tenants have complained about problems including infestations of mold and mice.
Shannon Darrow, a program manager at the tenant advocacy group Fair Housing Action Center of Maryland, said she was "appalled" by Trump's comments and considered them ironic given the legacy of Kushner's properties in the Baltimore area.
"Basically, [Kushner] has been creating a race to the bottom in terms of poorly maintained properties," she said. "He's been very, very deeply implicated."
A company representative did not address questions Sunday about whether the group agreed with Trump's characterization of the area, but wrote: "Kushner Companies is proud to own thousands of apartments in the Baltimore area."
Baltimore County Executive John A. Olszewski Jr. (D) condemned Trump's comments as "an attack on basic decency."
"The president's own son-in-law was complicit in contributing to some of the neglect that the president purports to be so concerned about," he added.
In the past two years, the Kushner firm and its affiliated entities have been sued multiple times by Baltimore-area residents who allege that the company has charged them excessive fees and used the threat of eviction to pressure them into paying.
From 2013 to 2017, corporate entities associated with Kushner apartments requested the civil arrest of 105 former tenants - the highest number among all property managers in Maryland during that period, the Baltimore Sun reported. All had allegedly failed to appear in court to respond to charges of unpaid rent.
"Working families have been preyed on at the benefit of Mr. Kushner and his company," Olszewski said.
Kushner Cos. has owned almost 9,000 rental units across 17 complexes, many of them in Baltimore County, the Sun reported earlier this year.
The properties generate at least $90 million in annual revenue. Kushner stepped down as chief executive of the company in 2017, when he became a senior White House adviser.

Texto completo: Forty years ago, on Aug. 2, 1979, an aircraft bearing the numbers NY15 crashed short of the runway at Akron-Canton Airport, about 50 miles south of Cleveland.
The pilot, Yankees captain Thurman Munson, could not be freed before the Cessna twin-engine turbojet burst into flames.
The news of the 32-year-old All-Star catcher's death stunned the baseball world and shattered his teammates.
"When Thurman got killed, you know, we just lost all - the whole season was just kind of lost," third baseman Graig Nettles said in a 1981 deposition related to the wrongful death suit filed by Munson's widow, Diana.
"I knew that those men would never be the same,'' Diana Munson said last week from the Canton, Ohio, home that she and Thurman shared, not far from the site of the fiery crash.
Every Yankees fan can recall where they were when the news of Munson's death broke on that early summer evening.
But imagine being a teammate.
"I was in the backyard with my kids and my wife,'' Lou Piniella, 75, said from Tampa. "We got a call from Mr. [George] Steinbrenner. He was almost hysterical. I don't know what he was talking about initially. Finally, he told me that Thurman had had an accident and died in his airplane.''
STUNNED TEAMMATES
The Yankees had an off day after a series in Chicago and Munson was practicing landings and takeoffs in the $1.25 million Cessna Citation he purchased three weeks earlier. At 4:02 p.m., the plane sunk too low, clipped a tree and fell short of the runway, hit a tree stump and burst into flames, according to reports.
The National Transportation and Safety Board determined that pilot error was responsible for the crash, citing� lack of airspeed in the attempted landing and Munson's failure to fasten his seat belt.
"It was the most horrific news I've ever received,'' Hall of Fame pitcher Rich "Goose" Gossage, 68, said last week from Colorado Springs. "We had just gotten back from a weekend with Thurman busting my chops for not going flying with him because he had his plane out in Seattle when we were playing the Mariners.''
Shortstop Bucky Dent had just finished dining at a restaurant in the Twin Towers. "I came down and a parking attendant recognized me,'' said Dent, 67, who lives in Lake Worth, Florida. "He said it's a shame what happened to Thurman Munson. I said, 'What are you talking about?' He said he got killed in a plane crash. It buckled my knees. I just sat down on the hood of my car and I just started crying.''
Gossage said he received a call from Steinbrenner. "I shrieked,'' he said. "It didn't hit me until I walked back into the clubhouse. At Yankee Stadium, the first place I looked was Thurman's locker. It was cleaned out. His catching gear was hanging up. There was a big spread of flowers in the front of it. His shin guards, his chest protector, his mask, his catcher's glove. That's when it hit me. There isn't a day goes by that I don't think of him."
Munson had been named team captain in 1976, the first Yankee to have that honor since Lou Gehrig was chosen in 1935. Munson was the AL Rookie of the Year in 1970 and MVP in 1976. In the postseason, he hit .357 with three home runs and 22 RBIs. He averaged .292 in 11 seasons with the Yankees and won three Gold Gloves but is not enshrined in Cooperstown.
"He didn't get a chance to finish his legacy," Gossage said. "That guy deserves to be in the Hall of Fame."
FLYING HOME TO FAMILY
Munson, a licensed pilot since March 7, 1978, saw flying as a way to spend as much time as he could with his family during the season, Diana Munson said. She said they tried living in New York, but Thurman longed for the relative solitude of his home in Canton and would fly home whenever possible.
"It put a great deal of strain on me,'' she said of her husband's flying. "It was unnerving to know that he was up in the air.''
That was heightened when Munson transitioned from flying propeller planes to the jet.
"I was worried that he didn't have enough hours or wasn't as qualified as I wanted him to be,'' Diana Munson said of her husband's training, which took place from July 7-16, 1979, according to a document obtained by former Old Bethpage resident Allan Blutstein, an attorney in Washington, D.C., who specializes in uncovering documents under the Freedom of Information Act. The documents first appeared in the New York Times in 2018 after Blutstein obtained them in an examination of the wrongful death suit. the suit was settled out of court for an unspecified sum.
Munson's ex-teammates, some of whom flew with him on occasion, also were concerned about him flying.
Diana Munson added, "I don't think it was unfounded. Obviously. It was something that most of us tried to talk him out of."
Munson was the only fatality in the crash. Co-pilot David Hall, Munson's flight instructor when he started with props, and Jerry Anderson, Munson's friend, recovered from their injuries.
The coroner's report said Munson's neck had been broken and he was paralyzed, but the cause of death was asphyxiation from carbon monoxide in the fuselage. Hall testified in a 1980 deposition that as Munson lay motionless after the crash, he asked if he and Anderson were OK.
Hall said in his deposition that Munson's last words were "Help me, Dave.'' The two men could not free Munson and fled as smoke and flames entered the cockpit. Hall refused comment and Anderson did not respond to an email.
Diana Munson said she visited the two survivors in the hospital. " I just wanted to reassure them that I didn't blame them for not getting him out,'' she said. "I've never been real clear, but at this point, it doesn't matter. The fact that he was gone was what I had to deal with. Raise three children on my own. The circumstances didn't matter as much as the fact that he was gone.''
The couple's son, Michael, then 4, had a question for his mother.
"He said if Daddy was so strong, how come he didn't get out of the plane?'' she said. "To this day, those things are very difficult to deal with.''
The Yankees attended the funeral in Canton on Aug. 6 and played at Yankee Stadium that night. Murcer, who eulogized Munson earlier, got the game-winning hit against the Orioles.
"I can't comprehend that even to this day, 55,000 people crying,'' Gossage said. "You could hear people weeping uncontrollably behind us when we were standing in front of the dugout.''
Reggie Jackson, who had a tumultuous relationship with Munson early in Jackson's career with the Yankees, cried as he stood in rightfield at the beginning of the game.
"Reggie took it as hard as anyone,'' Diana Munson said. "There were rough times. There were times when they didn't speak, people say things, things happen, but people move on.''
That is what Diana Munson and her family have tried to do.
Mrs. Munson keynotes the annual Thurman Munson dinner in Manhattan that has raised more than $18 million for the Association for the Help for Retarded Children.
"He was tough and gritty and hardcore,'' she said. "Yet he was gentle and tender and kind and loving with his family. I think New Yorkers, in particular, got him, loved and respected him, and I think that's why we're still talking about him 40 years later.''

Death penalty helping Trump upstage Democrats

Texto completo: One neat thing about being the incumbent in a presidential race is, you get to set the agenda and make your opponent react to what you say and do.
And then you depict his or her reaction as weak, dumb and — worst of all — liberal.
That's why the Department of Justice decision last week to resume executions of condemned federal prisoners — ending a 16-year hiatus — is politically important for President Trump. He, himself, is already the issue of the 2020 campaign and this gives him one more chance to make the Democrats weak.
Never mind right and wrong, facts and figures. This is about what fits in a campaign slogan, bumper sticker or sound bite. Trump, tough. Democrats, it's complicated.
Not that there was ever any doubt where he stood. Long before he ran for office, back when he was just a famous rich guy, Trump was calling for reinstatement of capital punishment. He even spent $85,000 on full-page ads in four New York newspapers, urging resumption of executions when five Harlem men were wrongly accused of raping and beating a Central Park jogger in 1989. The men were convicted but later exonerated, and another man confessed to the crime. Trump has refused to say he was wrong about them, or the death penalty.
As president, Trump misses no opportunity to show his toughness. On this issue, after the murders of 11 people at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, he said, "People that do this, you have to bring back the death penalty. This is the worst form of terrorism."
It would be hard to find anything major that Trump and the Democratic contenders for president don't hotly disagree about. Tax cuts, immigration, foreign policy, judicial appointments, and that little matter of impeachment — you name it, Trump says he's doing great, and major Democrats deplore it.
So it was no surprise when Attorney General William Barr announced last Thursday that executions will resume at the Terre Haute, Indiana, federal prison in December and January. He also said the government has a new drug, pentobarbital, to replace a troublesome lethal combo that was challenged in court as a cruel and unusual way of carrying out the ultimate sentence.
Trump's challengers reacted quickly and predictably. Sen. Bernie Sanders promised, "When I am president, we will abolish the death penalty." Sen. Kamala Harris called it "immoral and deeply flawed," adding that "we need a national moratorium on the death penalty, not a resurrection."
Joe Biden has had trouble deciding whether he wants to be wishy or washy on those federal crime statutes he supported as a U.S. Senator and chairman of the judiciary committee years ago. He recently came out against capital punishment, though, reversing a long-standing position.
Whether he meant what he said about uneven, luck-of-the-draw application of the death penalty and some 160 exonerations of innocent inmates, or if he was just assuming the de rigueur posture of any Democratic nominee, Biden is now squarely opposed to Trump's stance.
And, whether he meant to or not, Barr scoured the 62 people on federal death row to find five truly vile killers to start the federal process. Each of them murdered children and four of the five had multiple victims — and the fifth tortured and murdered his 2-year-old daughter.
The Justice Department said they'd all exhausted their court appeals, but this latest action will probably prompt new filings. That change of chemicals, for instance, sounds like it will bring new court challenges.
The New York Times reported that a Pew Research Center survey showed 54 percent public support for capital punishment, which is still on the books in 29 states. Florida had its first execution under Gov. Ron DeSantis recently, and no politician has ever suffered for supporting capital punishment in this state.
Theologians, criminologists, lawyers, clergy and politicians can argue endlessly over the deterrent value, fairness or morality of execution vs. life without parole. But never mind all that, this is an election campaign.
The Democratic nominee for president will most assuredly promise not to permit any executions in federal prisons, no matter how ghastly the crime or how guilty the killer.
Trump, as we've seen, campaigns with all the nuanced subtlety, moral introspection and intellectual ambiguity of a Roadrunner cartoon. He'll probably have crowds chanting about executions at his campaign rallies.

Summer's searing heat taking toll on agriculture

Texto completo: You know it's going to be a long, hot summer if, on the day before you assume the political leadership of the United Kingdom - as Boris Johnson did on July 23 - one of the world's most authoritative newspapers, the New York Times, prints a column that begins with the phrase, "Boris Johnson, to whom lying comes as easily as breathing ..."
As searing as that opening line was, it wasn't the column's most pointed point. That came when it suggested that Prime Minister Johnson - formerly known as Mr. Brexit - might have trouble dealing with his European Union counterparts because, well, "It doesn't help, of course, that its officials regard Mr. Johnson as a dangerous buffoon."
Keep in mind that these are the Europeans playing nice. When they're not playing nice, they simply say nothing, like right now in response to the White House's demand that U.S.-EU trade talks include agriculture.
Silence, when it comes to trade talks, isn't golden.
Another sure sign of summer heat is the inability of most federal officials to see the broad, clear picture in front of them once the smell of burning jet fuel hits either end of Pennsylvania Avenue in late July.
For example, with Congress itching to leave on its annual August recess, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue announced changes in rules governing the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program to cut an estimated $2.5 billion and 3 million Americans from the program.
It's Secretary Sonny's second run at SNAP; he made a similar attempt during the 2018 Farm Bill fight. Congress roundly rejected his idea and left it out of the final, bipartisan bill. Now, just a year later, Perdue claims he has the authority to implement the cuts despite the Farm Bill that his boss, President Donald J. Trump, signed.
Worse, Perdue could not have picked a more perfectly awful time to make his legally questionable, politically clumsy move.
First, no sooner had Perdue assumed legal powers not given him by the Constitution, the president took to Twitter to note - wrongly, as is often the case with his tweets - that "Farmers are starting to do great again, after 15 years of a downward spiral."
As every farmer knows and every fact makes clear, there has been no 15-year downward spiral for "farmers" for decades. In fact, U.S. net farm income hit an all-time record, $123.4 billion, just six years ago before bottoming out at an estimated $62 billion in 2016.
After that whopper, though, the president did get the next fact exactly right: "The 16 Billion Dollar China 'replacement' money didn't exactly hurt!"
No, it didn't. Nor did the estimated $9 billion farmers also received in similar "trade mitigation" subsidies in 2018.
In fact, if the entire $16 billion in "China" money that the president alluded to was paid to farmers this fiscal year - and it won't because the paymaster, USDA's Commodity Credit Corp., must wait for the new fiscal year on Oct. 1 to replenish its drained accounts - the Trump "replacement" cash would represent 23 percent of 2019's forecasted net farm income of $69 billion.
Twenty-three percent. How's that's something to brag about when it flies in the face of most farmers' - and every American's - understanding of "free markets" and "free trade"?
Worse, the president's self-congratulatory tweet gave the Washington press corps another shot to compare White House policy directed at its rural political supporters - $16 billion in unfunded, non-congressionally approved subsidies - even as it makes an end run to cut congressionally-required, legal benefits to the poor by $2.5 billion.
It was such a slow, fat softball that even the myopic, mostly non-athletic White House press folks hammered it out of sight. "The selective socialism of Donald Trump: Farmers, yes. Poor families, no," declared a headline in the July 23 Washington Post.
Great. This long, hot summer just keeps getting longer and hotter.
Guebert's column appears weekly in dozens of publications. Past columns and contact information are posted at www.farmandfoodfile.com.

Texto completo: People are always changing their minds, day to day. But over the past 20-odd years one group has shifted to an astounding degree: highly educated white Democrats. I'm not sure I understand why this group has undergone such a transformation, but it has, and the effects are reshaping our politics.
The easiest way to describe the shift is to say that educated Democrats have moved steadily to the left. In 1994, only about a sixth of Democrats who had gone to graduate school said they were consistently liberal. In 2015, more than 50% did. In 1994, only 12% of Democrats with college degrees said they were consistently liberal. Eleven years later, 47% did, according to the Pew Research Center.
One of the results is that, as my colleague Thomas B. Edsall put it this week, there are now three Democratic Parties. The most moderate faction is the most nonwhite and focuses on pocketbook issues like jobs and taxes. The most left-wing segment is the most populated by whites. It focuses on issues like abortion, global warming, immigration and race and gender equity.
To say that white educated Democrats have moved left is true, but it's not the essential truth. The bigger truth is that this segment is now more likely to see politics through a racial lens. Racial equity has become the prism through which many in this group see a range of other issues.
For example, immigration is now seen through the lens of race in a way that simply wasn't true two decades ago. As Zach Goldberg noted in an essay in Tablet Magazine, between 1965 and 2000, the percentage of white liberals who wanted higher immigration levels never deviated far from 10%. During the Obama administration, the number rose to the range of 20 to 30%. Now, more than 50% of white progressives want to see higher immigration levels.
Many progressives see barriers to immigration as akin to unjust racial barriers. Many want to dismantle the border enforcement agencies and eliminate criminal sanctions against undocumented crossings precisely because they are seen as structures of oppression that white people impose on brown people.
The racial lens also affects views on foreign policy topics. For most of the 20th century, for example, white liberals consistently sympathized with Israel more than with the Palestinians. But that has reversed. White progressives are much more critical of Israel than ever before. What had once been seen as an intractable regional conflict between a democracy and a series of authoritarian regimes trying to destroy it is now seen as a conflict between a white colonialist power and the brown people it oppresses.
In this new dispensation, the concept of white privilege is on everybody's lips. As Goldberg points out, in 1996 and 2010 about a quarter of white liberals thought racial discrimination was a very serious problem. By 2016, 58% did. White liberals have warmer attitudes toward other races than they do toward their own.
In this dispensation, more white progressives view society as basically unjust. In last year's Hidden Tribes survey, for example, 86% of progressive activists said that people's life outcomes are outside their individual control.
This shift in outlook has yielded several paradoxes. As many researchers have pointed out, white progressives are now farther left on immigration and race and diversity issues than the typical Hispanic or African American voter.
Second, two of the great marks of privilege in our society are skin color and education levels, and yet in the Democratic Party it's the highly educated whites who express the greatest alienation with the system that benefits them so directly.
Third, the progressive framework is egalitarian, but the shift has opened up wider opinion and cultural gaps between this highly educated elite and less educated groups.
Why have white progressives moved so far so fast? There are several theories.
The most direct theory is that America is a land of systemic racism. Highly educated white progressives have woken up to this fact and are out in front of other groups. This is, after all, the nation that elected Donald Trump and that puts children in cages at the border.
The more cynical take starts with the observation that the creed of wokeness is mostly centered on the super-prestigious universities and the affluent progressive enclaves along the coasts. In this take, if you're a rich white child of privilege you have to go to extraordinary lengths to prove you're one of the good children of privilege and not one of the bad ones. In this take, white progressives don noble clothing to make themselves feel good without really dismantling the structures that keep them in lifestyle bubbles and on top.
For me, it's a good idea to assume that people adopt their positions for honest, well-intentioned reasons. The crucial question then becomes: When is the racial lens (with its implied charge of racism against those who disagree) the right lens to use and when is it not? When does it illuminate an issue and when does it conceal?

Texto completo: Donald Trump often complains that the media don't give him credit for his achievements. And I can think of at least one case where that's true. As far I can tell, almost nobody is reporting that he has presided over a huge - but hidden - increase in foreign aid, the money America gives to foreigners. In fact, the hidden Trump program, running around $40 billion a year, is probably the biggest giveaway to other nations since the Marshall Plan.
Unfortunately, the aid isn't going either to poor countries or to America's allies. Instead, it's going to wealthy foreign investors.
Before I get there, let's talk for a second about a claim Trump often makes about a highly visible part of his economic strategy, the tariffs he has imposed on imports from China and other countries. These tariffs, he has insisted again and again, are being paid by China and represent billions in gains to the United States.
This claim is, however, demonstrably false. Tariffs are normally paid by consumers in the importing country, not exporters.
So Trump's tariffs aren't a tax on foreigners, whatever he may think. On the other hand, his other policies have given selective foreigners a huge tax break.
Remember, Trump's only major legislative achievement is the 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act. The core of that bill was a sharp reduction in corporate tax rates, which has led to a drastic fall in tax revenues, on the order of $140 billion over the past year.
Who gains from this tax cut? Supporters of the bill claimed that the benefits would be passed on to workers in the form of higher wages, and they made a big deal over a flurry of corporate bonus announcements in early 2018. But those bonuses weren't actually very big, and they didn't continue.
What about the argument that tax cuts would promote a huge swell in business investment, which would push up wages? Well, that isn't happening, either; when it comes to business spending, the tax cut has been a big fizzle.
So who is benefiting from the tax cut? Basically, shareholders, who have received increased dividends and seen a lot of capital gains as corporations use their windfall not to invest, but to buy back their own stocks.
And a big share of these gains to shareholders has gone to foreigners.
We live, after all, in an era of globalized finance, in which wealthy investors normally own assets in many countries. Americans own trillions in foreign equity, both directly in the form of foreign stocks and indirectly in the form of stocks of U.S. corporations with foreign subsidiaries.
Overall, foreigners own about 35% of the equity in corporations subject to U.S. taxes. And as a result, foreign investors have received around 35% of the benefits of the tax cut. As I said, that's more than $40 billion a year.
To put this in perspective, Trump's tariffs on China have raised $20 billion.
Alternatively, we can compare Trump's gift to foreign investors with our actual spending on foreign aid (which is much smaller than most people imagine). In 2017, the U.S. spent $51 billion on "international affairs," but much of that was either the cost of operating embassies or military assistance. The Trump tax break for overseas investors is considerably bigger than the total amount we spend on foreign aid proper.
Trump's giveaway to foreign investors isn't going to make or break us, although it's probably enough to ensure that the tax cut will be, overall, a net drain on economic growth: Even if the tax cut has some positive effect on the total income generated here , this will probably be more than offset by the increased share of that income accruing to foreigners rather than U.S. citizens.
Still, even in America, $40 billion here, $40 billion there, and eventually you're talking about real money. Furthermore, it does seem worth pointing out that even as Trump boasts about taking money away from foreigners, his actual policies are doing exactly the opposite.

Texto completo: Editor's note: Part of a continuing series about events of the past that remain relevant.

Not far from the Pentagon in Northern Virginia, there is a small house nestled into a woodsy and green background - the kind of serene setting you'd imagine on a postcard. Designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, the Pope-Leighey House, as it's known in architectural circles, is a single-story home with a history both odd and a little sad.
While not nearly as famous as Wright masterpieces such as Fallingwater and the Guggenheim Museum, the story of the home is a remarkable, revealing tale that foreshadowed how many Americans live today.
It begins with a journalist at a now-defunct newspaper. His name was Loren Pope. In the 1930s, Pope was a copy editor at the Washington Evening Star.
"He's making $50 dollars a week," said Peter Christensen, a longtime tour guide at the Pope-Leighey home.
That's certainly not enough to afford a Frank Lloyd Wright house - at least the ones he had been designing at the time, which would run about $650,000 in today's dollars.
But in 1938, Pope saw Wright on the cover of Time magazine. The splashy story inside was a celebration of Wright nearly completing Fallingwater, a summer mansion in rural Pennsylvania built over a waterfall.
In passing, the article also mentioned that Wright wanted to create Usonian-style homes for middle-class, regular folks - people such as Pope and his wife.
The couple, as it happened, were in the market for a home. They had just bought a plot of land in Falls Church, Va. Pope wasn't sure what style of house he wanted to build there. Maybe a classic Cape Cod with a white picket fence.
"Loren reads the article. He is smitten," Christensen said. "He no longer wants that Cape Cod. He wants something more interesting."
He wants a Frank Lloyd Wright home. Then, he lobbied the architect to build him one, appealing to Wright's extraordinary ego.
Pope sent a letter.
"There are certain things a man wants during life, and, of life," he wrote. "Material things, and things of the spirit. It is for a house created by you. I feel that you are the great creative force of our time. Will you create a house for us?"
Three weeks later, Pope received a letter composed of one sentence. It read: "Dear Loren Pope, Of course I'm ready to give you a house."
There was just one problem: Pope couldn't afford its $7,000 price tag. No banks would give him a loan, so Pope persuaded his employer, the Washington Star newspaper, to lend him the money.
Once construction began in 1940, strangers would show up. In 2006, Pope told Blueprints Magazine that people would walk onto the property to see the construction.
"Architects," he said, "would come by and try to pick up any sets of drawings lying around."
The house - just one story - has two levels. A few steps down from the entryway is an open room with windows up high that fill the room with light.
The room is a combination of library and living room, with in-wall bookshelves on one end and a fireplace on the other. Nearby is a table for meals, playing cards or reading.
The floor-to-ceiling windows are also doors that lead directly to a patio, extending and combining the inner and outer worlds, a Wright obsession.
"He has this idea that houses shouldn't be a series of little rectangles," Christensen said. "He wants to break the box. He wants to integrate space."
In other words, he aimed for the kinds of open floor plans many homebuyers seek today.
With its windows and vents strategically placed, and with the floor a concrete slab, the house lights and moderates temperature on its own. It was green before going green became a thing.
Pope's mind was blown.
"I thought Mr. Wright was a genius," he told Blueprints.
"That's what's so amazing about Wright," Christensen said. "He was doing this stuff 100 years before anybody else.
But even within the walls of an innovative home designed by a master architect, there are still the trappings of life - sadness, tragedy, regret.
Loren and Charlotte Pope, along with their 3-year-old son, Ned, moved into their dream house in March of 1941.
A few months later, Ned was playing outside one day and wandered off.
"That was my day off," Pope told The Post in an interview decades later. "I was walking outside, digging on something. He just sort of got away. I wasn't paying attention, I guess."
Ned drowned in a neighbor's pond. Pope blamed himself for the rest of his life.
He and Charlotte had two more children, but after four years of living in the house, they decided to sell it. They had outgrown it. But the walls were closing in other ways, too. There was a sadness that no architectural detail could soothe.
"The day we left," Pope told the New York Times, "I sat on the fireplace hob and wept."
The new buyers were a young couple named Robert and Marjorie Leighey, who paid $17,000 for the house. They, too, faced challenges.
In 1960, the Virginia Department of Highways sent a letter saying that it was building a new road - Interstate 66 - and it would go right through the house. Robert Leighey had recently died, so saving the house was left to Marjorie.
She banded together with local community members and even took her case to Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall. Udall got behind the endeavor, and in 1964, Majorie donated the house to the National Trust for Historic Preservation.
Interstate 66 was going to be built no matter what, so the National Trust did what any dedicated preservation organization would do - it moved the house about 20 miles away to Alexandria, on land once owned by George Washington's family.
That's right: They took everything apart, then loaded pieces of the house on flatbed trucks and put it back together. Amazingly, that wasn't the only time the house was disassembled.
In the mid-1990s, preservationists discovered that the base of the house was cracking. So, the whole thing was taken apart a second time and moved 30 feet to sturdier ground.
No one lives there now. Everyone involved with the home - Pope, his wife, the Leigheys and, of course, Wright - is deceased.
The National Trust preserved most of the original furniture, appliances and decoration. Being in the house, you can understand how it might feel to live there - peaceful, quiet, even a little spiritual.
That is, until the phone rings. The original landline is still in the house. Christensen answered.
It was a robocall.

Bergman Summer Movies Raise the Temperature

Texto completo: The fleeting Nordic summer, a respite from the darkness of interminable winter, is "the loveliest time of the year," the Swedish author Selma Lagerlof wrote, with some understatement, in "The Story of Gosta Berling": "Everything was beautiful. The road, gray and dusty as it was, had its border of flowers." Even "the smallest child went on the road with a bunch of lilacs in her hand, and every peasant woman had a little bouquet stuck in her neckerchief."
This heady season of bright nights, wild strawberries and pantheistic joy is recalled as a time of intense yearning and elusive happiness, shadowed by an impending autumn, in the early movies of Sweden's greatest filmmaker, Ingmar Bergman -- notably "Summer Interlude" (1951) and "Summer With Monika" (1953).
"Summer Interlude" is a journey into the past. It opens with a montage of the earth in bloom, followed by a shot of windblown leaves. The heart of the movie is a prolonged flashback that begins when a dancer (Maj-Britt Nilsson), feeling old and already mourning her youth at 28, receives a journal written some 15 years earlier by the boy, long dead, who was her first love (Birger Malmsten).
Nilsson gives a terrific performance, both as a high-spirited adolescent and a prematurely world-weary ballerina. Not only lyrical, the movie can be frisky, too, as in the playful interpolation of an animated cartoon. A small film with big ambitions regarding the nature of love and mortality as well as the relationship between life and theater, "Summer Interlude" is alternately melodramatic and expressionistic, occasionally verging on the supernatural. Still, the filmmaking feels fresh and emotionally raw, leaving the odd sense of Bergman already nostalgic for his own innocence.
Apparently the first Bergman film to open in the United States (under the title "Illicit Interlude"), "Summer Interlude" was praised by the New York Times critic Bosley Crowther as a "beautifully realized recount of a rhapsodic romance," and a movie "no more meriting the pornographic word 'illicit' than it deserves to be labeled smut." On the other hand, "Summer With Monika," released here a few years later as "Monika: The Story of a Bad Girl," cut and rescored by the lounge-music maestro Lex Baxter, was considered an exploitation film and not reviewed in The Times. (Having heard as a teenager about a Swedish movie "in which a young woman swam completely naked," Woody Allen claimed to have "slept overnight on the curb to be the first on line" when "Monika" opened at a Brooklyn movie house.)
"Summer With Monika" is a more extreme version of "Summer Interlude." The love story is transposed to a working-class milieu and charged with the spirit of youthful rebellion; the film is even more lyrical, and emotionally harsher. The shop girl Monika (20-year-old Harriet Andersson, in her first movie) picks up a delivery boy (Lars Ekborg) and persuades him to play hooky with her during a summer idyll that ends in an unwanted pregnancy and an unwise marriage.
The story may be familiar. Monika, who lives for the moment and eschews any domestic responsibility, is not. Bergman's repeated cutaways to sky, water and the summer landscape, establish her as an impulsive child of nature. More than that, Monika is also a foe of stuffy bourgeois morality. Andersson's challenging, uninhibited performance is comparable to that of her French contemporary Brigitte Bardot -- a quality not lost on the young critics, soon to be New Wave directors, Jean-Luc Godard and Francois Truffaut.
Writing in 1958, Godard praised "Monika" as "the cinematographic event of the year," adding that "it is today what 'Birth of a Nation' is to the classical cinema," while Truffaut had the protagonist of his first movie "The 400 Blows" (1959) steal a poster of Andersson's Monika. The close-up shot of Andersson's defiant stare into the camera (what Godard called "the saddest shot in the history of cinema") is thought by some to have inspired Jean Seberg's similar gaze at the end of "Breathless" (1960).
Two years after "Monika," "Smiles of a Summer Night" (1955) won a prize at Cannes and confirmed Bergman's international reputation as well as his artistic maturity. A sophisticated sex farce in the tradition of Jean Renoir and Max Ophuls, set at the dawn of the 20th century, it mixes and matches four couples, giving the most weight to a stuffy middle-aged lawyer (Gunnar Bjornstrand) with a teenage bride (Ulla Jacobsson), and a former mistress (the distinguished actress Eva Dahlbeck). Crowther began his Times review by asking, "Who would have thought that august Sweden would be sending us a film comedy as witty and cheerfully candid about the complexities of love as any recent French essay on l'amour?"
Who indeed? "Smiles" is a movie of elaborate contrivances. The magical wine served during the course of a summer night spent at a country chateau serves to bring the ensemble into correct romantic alignment. The underlying tone is one of labored rue; although the movie does at times come close to farce, only Dahlbeck and Harriet Andersson, playing the requisite saucy maid, appear to be having fun.
Pauline Kael called "Smiles of a Summer Night" a "nearly perfect" film. Perhaps. The gears click smoothly into place, the aphorisms land with a gentle thud, and the actors hit their marks with professional aplomb. But it is certainly possible to prefer the imperfections of Bergman's wilder, more soulfully self-pitying summer stories.
"Smiles" provided the basis for Stephen Sondheim's 1973 musical "A Little Night Music," later filmed in 1977, and inspired Woody Allen in his 1982 feature "A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy" -- a respectful spoof that would have benefited from the anarchic insolence of that bad girl, Monika.
"Summer Interlude," "Summer with Monika" and "Smiles of Summer Night" may all be streamed from the Criterion Channel . "Summer with Monika" is also available on Amazon Prime . "A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy" can be streamed via YouTube , Google Play , Vudu and elsewhere.

Texto completo: DES MOINES - Saturday morning, before his first appearance at these U.S. outdoor track and field championships, Noah Lyles dyed the top half of his hair silver, an odd color choice for an elite sprinter. It made sense for someone who, like Lyles, has an encyclopedic knowledge of the Japanese anime cartoon Dragon Ball Z.
"I'm glad you asked about [the hair]," Lyles said. "In Dragon Ball Z, Goku's final stage, or form, is Ultra Instinct, and his hair turns silver/gray. I'm ready to go. I'm ready to make the team. I'm in my highest state."
Lyles, a 22-year-old former All-Met from T.C. Williams High, is racing to claim his first major championship, to acquire hardware commensurate with blazing race times that have helped make him a star. When he came to the national championships in 2017, he pulled a hamstring in his first round of qualifying for the 200 meters and had to pull out. Saturday, he had an easy start in the first round, setting him up for Sunday night's semifinal and final.
Lyles jogged to the finish line through a head wind and still won his heat in 20.65 seconds, more than a second slower than the 19.50 personal best he ripped off last month in Lausanne, Switzerland, the fourth-fastest time in history.
Performances like those, combined with his penchant for showmanship, are why many in the track world have anointed Lyles a prime candidate to fill the sprinting vacuum created by Usain Bolt's retirement. At a promotional event this week, Bolt shared his impression of Lyles with the New York Times.
"Yeah, I've seen him run, I've seen him compete," Bolt told the paper. "Last season he was doing a lot of good things; this season he has started off good. But as I said, it all comes down to the championship. Is he confident to come into a race after running three races and show up? For me he has shown that he has talent, but when the championship comes, we will see what happens."
After his race, a reporter showed Lyles Bolt's words.
"Sounds about right to me," Lyles said. "Sounds like my thoughts exactly. That's why I decided to choose one event this year."
Lyles sat out the 100 at these championships to better ensure a gold in the 200, his best event. He watched as Christian Coleman, one of Lyles's rivals, won the 100, which he plans to compete in at next summer's Tokyo Olympics.
Earlier this year, after Lyles beat Coleman in a 100 and declared it the start of his "legacy" as a 100 and 200 runner, Coleman bristled on social media. Despite the personality conflict, Coleman wouldn't have a problem running with Lyles on a relay team.
"Why would I?" Coleman said. "When we put on the USA uniform and the job is to get the stick around, it is what it is."
For now, Lyles's focus is on winning the national championship. But it is not exactly his final stage. He noted that he had only dyed the top half of his hair silver and continued his lesson in Dragon Ball Z canon.
"So, when Goku first reaches the first part of his Ultra Instinct, he was only halfway completed," Lyles said. "So by the time I get to Doha [for the world championships in September], it'll be fully colored in."
Hiltz qualifies for worlds Nikki Hiltz finished third in the women's 1,500 to claim the final spot at the world championships in Qatar. Her joy was laced with a sad reality.
Hiltz is openly gay, which she said will require her to use extra security because of Qatar's regressive views and laws. Homosexuality is illegal and can be punished with jail time in Qatar.
"Someone actually asked me that a month ago: 'Are you nervous if you make it to Doha?' " Hiltz said. "I was, 'Why?' They're like, 'Well, people get stoned and put in jail for being who they are.' I didn't really realize that, but I have been kind of thinking about it. It's so bizarre. We live in our liberal bubbles of the U.S., and we forget there's so much hate out there." . . .
Pole vaulter Sam Kendricks cleared 6.06 meters, setting an American record. The jump means a vaulter who competes for America actually owns the national record. Armand Duplantis, a dual citizen who grew up in Louisiana with a Swedish mother, jumped 6.05 meters in 2018. Even though he competes under the Swedish flag, his dual citizenship meant he owned the American record. . . .
DeAnna Price broke her American record in the hammer throw with a final heave of 78.24 meters, the leading mark in the world this year. Price finished eighth at the 2016 Olympics. . . .
On his 22nd birthday, Rai Benjamin further entrenched himself as a threat to win an Olympic gold medal in the men's 400-meter hurdles. He destroyed the field, crossing in 47.23 seconds, more than 1.3 seconds faster than second-place TJ Holmes. "I wanted to run faster," Benjamin said. "But it's okay." . . .
Vashti Cunningham captured her third consecutive national championship in the women's high jump with a leap of 1.96 meters. Cunningham, who is coached by her father, former NFL quarterback Randall Cunningham, cleared 2 meters for the first time in a June 30 meet in Palo Alto, Calif., and in Qatar she'll aim for 2.02 meters. "Going into these higher heights after breaking that barrier, jumping 2.0, I just feel very confident and just very comfortable."

Texto completo: In the first few months of "The Daily," we reached Mike Schmidt on the road, using the only landline phone connection he could find: the customer service line at Kinko's. Here's how the interview began:
Schmidt: Hey.
Barbaro: Hey!
Schmidt: Sorry. So I got the folks here at Kinko's to let me use the phone.
Barbaro: How did you do that?
Schmidt: I told them I needed to call the office.
Barbaro: [Laughs]
Schmidt: But the problem is, I've got my laptop on the other side of Kinko's here, and I'm afraid some Russian spies are gonna take it, so I got to keep my eyes on it.
In many shows, an exchange like that would be left on the cutting room floor. It's not necessary to understand the story. But we decided to use it.
We realized that the spontaneous exchanges we have at the beginning of our interviews could be powerful. These moments allow you to experience Times reporters as real people with quirks, tempers, a sense of humor and, in some cases, a magnificent singing voice.
We were rolling when Maggie Haberman came on the line from our studio in Washington and did what comes naturally -- to her, anyway -- when sitting in front of a microphone: She belted out a tune. We ran it on the next morning's show.
In other episodes, you heard Matt Rosenberg getting locked out of the studio. And Matt Apuzzo apologizing, profusely and colorfully, for showing up late to an interview.
As producer Andy Mills put it, "We wanted to be transparent about how a story comes together, in part by showing reporters just being themselves."
As these humanizing moments have become a fixture of the show, we've had to wrestle with the question of how much is too much. We think of them as little audio gifts, to be delivered sparingly.
Occasionally, listeners tell us they've had their fill. "I really don't care for the weird openings," wrote Cameron Collins, a listener in St. Louis.
Fair enough.
But some of you do like them. That's why, this week, a special afternoon episode previewing the congressional testimony of Robert Mueller opened with me telling our old friend Mike Schmidt that I had missed him. Mike demurred. From there, things got a little therapeutic. In the middle of that episode, Mike reached for a word that seemed to be eluding him. I jumped in with suggestions:
Schmidt: Is "resuscitated" the right word?
Barbaro: I think that's fair.
Schmidt: You resuscitate someone --
Barbaro: Revived? Reinforced? Recreated? Restated?
Schmidt: We already know many of the facts that will be restated tomorrow.
Jake Blozan from San Jose, Calif., wrote to us after hearing that exchange.
"Maybe it was because of the time crunch, maybe it was filler, or maybe it was an intentional stylistic choice, but I loved the extra banter and the stumbling/reaching for a word that were left in," Jake wrote. "It brings what can often be somewhat somber or even (dare I say) drier topics a bit more levity."
We agree.

What does Mike Schmidt do when he's not covering the Mueller investigation?
After not hearing from Mike Schmidt for almost two months, we had the privilege of talking to our elusive Washington correspondent twice this week. Many of us wondered what he'd been up to. Some suggested that he might be living in, as Michael Barbaro put it, a "suspended reality." We asked him if this was the case, and here's what he told us:
______
______
What we're listening to
Who: Dan Powell, audio systems engineer
What: "Music for Staying Warm," an album by Justin Wright
Favorite track: "Modular Winter"
Shortly after I started working on podcasts full time, I noticed a change in my music tastes: I was no longer listening to songs with vocals in them. This wasn't a conscious choice, but I've since theorized that having to listen to hours of speech every day for work led me to need a break from the human voice in my downtime. Of course, I'll still queue up the angsty rock I listened to in high school and college once in a while for nostalgia's stake, but most of the new music I seek out these days is instrumental.
This week, I've been listening to "Music for Staying Warm," a contemporary classical album by cellist and composer Justin Wright. It's a beautiful, elegantly arranged collection of string quartet compositions with an emphasis on drones and negative space. I've found it helpful for added concentration while tending to non-audio tasks at work, but also for unwinding, relaxing and reflecting at the end of the day. And even though the album fits my requirement of "no voices allowed," the compositions are all emotive in a way that feels unmistakably human.
______
On 'The Daily' this week
■ Boris Johnson made Brexit, and now Brexit has made Boris Johnson Britain's prime minister.
■ Dr. Leana Wen's ouster from Planned Parenthood underscores one of the group's central tensions: Is it a political organization or a health organization first?
■ "There's a growing disconnect between the growing demographics of the country and the way our electoral system represents the population," says Nate Cohn.
■ Mike Schmidt on Robert Mueller's long-awaited testimony before Congress: "Mueller's signaling, 'Look, Russian interference in the election in 2016 was a huge deal, and it could be a problem going forward. Please pay attention."'
■ Megan Twohey has reported on President Trump, Harvey Weinstein and Jeffrey Epstein. Now she's asking: Are there connections between their cases?

Texto completo: LONDON - After one of the most brutal political reshuffles in recent memory, the new Cabinet appointed by Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain met Thursday to sign up to his hard-line pledge to complete Brexit - without any agreement if necessary and whatever the cost - in less than 100 days.
Johnson's Cabinet dispenses with around half the top team of his predecessor, Theresa May - a cull that shocked many with its scope and blunt political messaging.
The prime minister told the new Cabinet that it was "wonderful" to see them assembled, adding, "We have a momentous task ahead of us, at a pivotal moment in our country's history."
"We are now committed, all of us, to leaving the European Union on Oct. 31 or indeed earlier - no ifs, no buts," he said.
Johnson made the same promise outside Downing Street on Wednesday, and he has insisted that all members of his Cabinet are signed up to that objective whether or not it means a damaging, potentially chaotic, no-deal exit.
But the purge of the Cabinet seemed to go further, dispensing even with some longtime supporters of Brexit, like Penny Mordaunt, who lost her role as defense secretary, and Liam Fox, who had supported Johnson's leadership rival, Jeremy Hunt, and was ditched as trade secretary.
Hunt, who had been foreign secretary, also left, after refusing a demotion. He was replaced by Dominic Raab, a hard-line former Brexit secretary who resigned in November in protest at May's proposed withdrawal agreement.
Johnson's reshuffle seemed intended to send a clear message to the European Union that his government meant what it said when it insisted that it would quit without any agreement if necessary. Optimists hope this show of resolve might persuade the European side to offer the sort of concessions to Johnson that it has so far steadfastly refused to contemplate.
Some of Johnson's allies say they have not given up hope of striking a deal in Brussels, and they express belief that an agreement is possible if both sides make concessions.
Those hopes depend on the EU agreeing to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement, and there has been no sign of that so far. On Thursday, a spokesman for the European Commission, its executive arm, said, "We will not reopen the withdrawal agreement."
Some commentators see in the makeup of Johnson's new team a Cabinet that is battle-ready for a general election, if the prime minister is blocked by Parliament from leaving the EU without a deal.
The new Cabinet also looked like a group assembled to combat the electoral threat from Nigel Farage, the leader of the Brexit Party, which advocates a total break from the EU.
Sajid Javid was among the big winners in Johnson's reshuffle. Javid, whose father, a bus driver, was an immigrant from Pakistan, took charge of the country's finances as chancellor of the Exchequer.
Javid's old job as home secretary was taken by Brexit supporter Priti Patel, who resigned as international development secretary in May's government in November 2017 because she had held meetings with officials in Israel without informing Cabinet colleagues.
Michael Gove, who, together with Johnson, led the pro-Brexit referendum campaign in 2016, will be in charge of preparations for a no-deal exit.
Jacob Rees-Mogg, who led the most hard-line group of Conservative lawmakers pushing for the EU withdrawal, became leader of the House of Commons.

Is a billionaire populist the right choice for Democrats?

Información de publicación: The Sun ; San Bernardino, Calif. [San Bernardino, Calif]. 26 July 2019.

Texto completo: These are strange times, as Democratic voters consider whether the best way to take on a billionaire populist is to nominate their own inexperienced billionaire populist.
The Democratic presidential primary now has its 25th candidate, with the late entry of Bay Area billionaire Tom Steyer, a climate-change and impeachment activist.
Steyer hasn’t made a dent in the polls, but his money could shake up the race given his intent to spend $100 million.
So far, Steyer’s entry has gone over like a lead balloon. “Interviews with Democratic senators and representatives revealed significant resentment toward Steyer for his practice of using his wealth to pressure lawmakers that have not advocated for impeaching President Trump,” reported the Free Beacon.
His ads targeting anti-impeachment Democrats, and slams against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, haven’t made him many friends on the Left.
His personal wealth is an obstacle in a party that views billionaire financiers as a scourge. And his big-spending plans would find resistance with the broader electorate.
Steyer’s “Justice-Centered Climate Plan” might not go as far as the “Green New Deal,” but it’s estimated to boost government spending by $2.3 trillion — at a time when federal debt has soared to $22 trillion and both parties have agreed to obliterate spending caps.
Most observers view Steyer’s long-time environmental advocacy as sincere, but he has to deal with allegations of hypocrisy. The New York Times reported in 2014 that Steyer’s fund had “pumped hundreds of millions of dollars into companies that operate coal mines and coal-fired power plants from Indonesia to China, records and interviews show.” He has expressed regret for fossil-fuel investments, but it makes for bad optics among Democrats.
Other Democratic candidates are peeved at a billionaire buying his way into the presidential fray. “All campaigns should be grassroots funded in a primary,” said U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, who is polling in the top tier.
U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, has likewise criticized the role of billionaires in the election process. Several left-leaning commentators have rolled their eyes at Steyer’s entry and have asked him to just go away.
On the good side, Steyer has taken shots at the socialistic ethic that is emerging on the Democratic left.
“Should we put a limit on what Beyoncé makes?” he asked the Guardian. “I don’t see why. I don’t think in the United States of America we should put a ceiling on how far people can go.”
He even took aim at Karl Marx. We’re dismayed that it’s even necessary to point out the flaws of Marxism in 2019, but we’ll take small victories when we get them.
In our view, the Democrats have their best chance of unseating Donald Trump by running mainstream moderate-to-liberal candidates who campaign on national unity rather than progressives who are intent on remaking the economy and ratcheting up federal spending. But that’s ultimately for their voters to decide.
Based on Democratic Party rules, however, Steyer needs a large base of small donors or decent poll numbers to make it onto the stage.
Despite our misgivings about Steyer’s candidacy, there’s nothing wrong with having a freewheeling election where the largest number of candidates pitch their ideas.
We wish Steyer and the other candidates were discussing better ideas, but that’s a discussion for another day.

His personal wealth is an obstacle in a party that views billionaire financiers as a scourge. And his big-spending plans would find resistance with the broader electorate.
Steyer’s “Justice-Centered Climate Plan” might not go as far as the “Green New Deal,” but it’s estimated to boost government spending by $2.3 trillion — at a time when federal debt has soared to $22 trillion and both parties have agreed to obliterate spending caps.
Most observers view Steyer’s long-time environmental advocacy as sincere, but he has to deal with allegations of hypocrisy. The New York Times reported in 2014 that Steyer’s fund had “pumped hundreds of millions of dollars into companies that operate coal mines and coal-fired power plants from Indonesia to China, records and interviews show.” He has expressed regret for fossil-fuel investments, but it makes for bad optics among Democrats.
Other Democratic candidates are peeved at a billionaire buying his way into the presidential fray. “All campaigns should be grassroots funded in a primary,” said U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, who is polling in the top tier.
U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, has likewise criticized the role of billionaires in the election process. Several left-leaning commentators have rolled their eyes at Steyer’s entry and have asked him to just go away.
On the good side, Steyer has taken shots at the socialistic ethic that is emerging on the Democratic left.
“Should we put a limit on what Beyoncé makes?” he asked the Guardian. “I don’t see why. I don’t think in the United States of America we should put a ceiling on how far people can go.”
He even took aim at Karl Marx. We’re dismayed that it’s even necessary to point out the flaws of Marxism in 2019, but we’ll take small victories when we get them.
In our view, the Democrats have their best chance of unseating Donald Trump by running mainstream moderate-to-liberal candidates who campaign on national unity rather than progressives who are intent on remaking the economy and ratcheting up federal spending. But that’s ultimately for their voters to decide.
Based on Democratic Party rules, however, Steyer needs a large base of small donors or decent poll numbers to make it onto the stage.
Despite our misgivings about Steyer’s candidacy, there’s nothing wrong with having a freewheeling election where the largest number of candidates pitch their ideas.
We wish Steyer and the other candidates were discussing better ideas, but that’s a discussion for another day.

Texto completo: Amazon Prime Video executives are so convinced their new series "The Boys" will be a hit that a second season has been ordered before Friday's first season debut. Based on The New York Times best-selling comic by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson, the capes-and-criminals series looks at what happens when superheroes become so popular they are treated like gods. Their abuse of power that comes from the hero worship attracts the attention of a group called The Boys, which looks to expose the truth.

Amazon's show of faith in the project fits with the relationship executive producers Seth Rogen and Eric Kripke have had with the company from the start.

"It has been very different working for them and by-in-large great," says Kripke, whose other producing credits include "Supernatural" and "Timeless." "Being able to create something that's rated R is something that I haven't been able to do with all my network travels. It seems like it wouldn't be a big deal, but anyone who knows me knows I have an incredibly dirty sense of humor."

The freedom the team has had isn't just to be able to use profanity or show nudity but was necessary to be able to fully present the story Ennis has written. The biggest concern Kripke had starting was that he would be able to properly adapt "The Boys" both because of the quality of the original work along with his love for the property.

This isn't the first creation by Ennis that has been adapted to a television series but follows in the footsteps of "Preacher." Seeing his work go from printed page to small screen is something Ennis finds to be fascinating, especially in regards to what is used and what doesn't make the cut. The one thing Ennis has learned is to treat the original and the adaptation as two separate things because they inevitably will go in different directions.

Ennis started writing "The Boys" at the beginning of 2005 in reaction to what was going on in the world. Although DC Comics canceled the title after only six issues, Dynamite Comics picked it up and it would run for 72 issues before ending in 2012.

"It was the beginning of the second Bush two administration, and that's why there is so much in there about corruption, corporate influence on government, abuse of power. Superheroes seemed to be an interesting way to do that," Ennis says. "I've also been fascinated about intelligence agency and what they see as their prevue and their abuse of power, too.

"It seemed to me if superheroes really existed in the real world they would be like rock stars crossed with politicians. They would have the theme and glitz and glamor of rock stars, but they would be having a genuine effect on the world. It seemed to me that effect would be a corporate one because they would be immediately branded and bought."

"The Boys" is one title in a career of writing comics for Ennis that spans 25 years. His other works include "Hitman," "Code Pru," "303," "Pride and Joy," "Rover Red Charlie," "A Train Called Love" and "Red Team." Kripke had wanted to produce a version of "Preacher" that Ennis wrote but was too late to snag that title.

The task of telling the irreverent tale in the eight-episode first season of "The Boys" falls to Jack Quaid, Karl Urban, Laz Alonso, Elisabeth Shue, Tomer Capon, Antony Starr, Karen Fukuhara, Erin Moriarty, Chase Crawford, Nathan Mitchell and Simon Pegg.

Pelosi needs to control 'Squad'

Texto completo: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi needs to bring the gavel down on her meddlesome freshmen and demonstrate that messing with her still has consequences. Or else she will ride out her remaining years as a much weaker speaker.
Months before Nancy Pelosi first became speaker of the House, she reflected on the battles she had to fight to achieve her position at the head of the Democratic House caucus. She had risen as something of an outsider in what she saw as a boys club, and it wasn't always a pleasant experience. But she developed a reputation for toughness. As she said, "Anybody who's ever dealt with me knows not to mess with me."
That was a dozen years ago. Today, in her dealings with the progressive collective dubbed "the Squad," it is fair to ask where this pugnacious spirit has gone. Because Democratic Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota are definitely messing with her, as well as the Democratic Party. And Pelosi has yet to put them in their place.
Never have so few congressional newcomers been so influential. The four freshmen receive an unprecedented level of news media attention. Their comments are sought out on any number of major policy issues, far out of proportion to their experience, expertise or legislative record, which is basically nonexistent. And while most Americans probably have no idea who the House Democratic Whip is (it's 26-year veteran James Clyburn of South Carolina), they have certainly heard of the Squad.
The Squad swept into Congress to promote a bold progressive agenda and make themselves President Donald Trump's personal nightmare. But House newbies are not supposed to raise a ruckus. Their job, if they want to remain in what can be a lifetime perch, is to learn the folkways of the institution, build support networks with other members and the professional staff, and support the leadership agenda. The institutional ethos of Congress and American politics in general is one of dealmaking and compromise, not grand futile gestures.
Nancy Pelosi understood this from a young age. Her father, Thomas "Big Tommy" D'Alesandro Jr., served in Congress and later, as mayor of Baltimore in the 1950s, kept power through patronage, maintaining a "favor file" of people he had helped out, and from whom he expected loyalty. You don't get in the favor file by being a constant source of embarrassment and disruption.
Pelosi has generally been dismissive of the Squad and their antics. She mocked the "Green New Deal" – a ridiculous initiative to ban the internal combustion engine and socialize the American economy – as "the green dream or whatever they call it." After the Squad loudly opposed a bipartisan, compromise border bill that the House leadership promoted, according to The New York Times, Pelosi said that "all these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world" but they don't have votes.
And in Pelosi's practical world, votes are how things get done. But the Squad is seemingly not interested in legislating and projects an image of a Democratic Party defined by sullen, brooding anger with no realistic programs and no sense of reasonable national priorities.
Members of Congress are also supposed to represent the interests of their constituents, something the members of the Squad have been slow to appreciate. They seem more interested in bending the arc of history (or some such nonsense) than taking care of the dinner table needs of the voters. Omar and Tlaib's grandstanding push for boycotting Israel, which Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Calif., called "dead on arrival," does nothing to improve the lives of the people in Minnesota and Michigan. Their upcoming trip to the Jewish state will only exacerbate tensions between Jewish-American voters and the Democratic Party.
And when Amazon abandoned plans to build a major headquarters in New York City, Ocasio-Cortez exulted at the power of "dedicated, everyday New Yorkers & their neighbors" who "defeated Amazon's corporate greed, its worker exploitation, and the power of the richest man in the world." But this was really the work of strident progressive activists; "everyday New Yorkers" just saw 25,000 jobs and $27billion in revenue vanish.
This could be why some members of the Squad are extremely unpopular. A CBS/YouGov poll found that Ocasio-Cortez has a favorable rating of 23%, Omar 19%, Tlaib 18% and Pressley 17%. Democratic leaders also leaked a poll showing that the Squad is deeply unpopular in swing states, and that "socialism is toxic to these voters," according to Axios. This was a shot across the bow, telling Squad members to shape up or face the consequences, either from Democratic primary challengers or in the general election.
But Pelosi has been remarkably ineffective in disciplining Squad members. She allowed a rebuke of Omar for anti-Semitic comments to be watered down. She has not stripped Squad members of important committee memberships, like Speaker John Boehner did back in 2012 when three freshmen Tea Party Republicans opposed him on a mere procedural measure.
And she has not forced a purge of troublesome staff members.
In the wake of the border bill vote, Ocasio-Cortez's chief of staff, Saikat Chakrabarti, tweeted that the moderates who supported the speaker were akin to 1940s segregationist Democrats and were voting to "put kids in concentration camps." This sparked outrage in the caucus, and Chakrabarti deleted one of his offensive tweets. But how does someone that maladroit and confrontational still have a job? If Chakrabarti is still employed at the end of the week, it will be a signal that anything goes.
Pelosi's meeting this week with Ocasio-Cortez is being treated by the news media as though it is a summit, as if they were peers. The very fact that a meeting between the speaker and a new member is considered newsworthy speaks to the Squad's power, and they are well aware of it.
Their perspective on the liberal Democratic old guard was summed up by Omar: "We never need to ask for permission or wait for an invitation to lead." One can't imagine powerful Democratic old pols like Tip O'Neill, John McCormack or Sam Rayburn putting up with that kind of nonsense.
Pelosi needs to bring the gavel down on her meddlesome freshmen and demonstrate that messing with her still has consequences. Or else she will ride out her remaining years as a much weaker speaker.

Ilhan Omar on Trump: This is 'a fight for the soul of our nation'

Resumen: In a NYT op-ed, the Democrat issued a rallying cry for Americans to respond to Donald Trump's racism by defending the nation's ideal which she said are under attack. "It’s time to respond with the kind of conviction that has made America great before," she wrote.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Rep. Ilhan Omar on Thursday, in a new pushback against President Donald Trump's "go back" rhetoric, said the president is using his bully pulpit "to mount racist attacks on communities across the land. "
“Throughout history, demagogues have used state power to target minority communities and political enemies, often culminating in state violence,” Omar, D-Minn. , wrote in an op-ed published in the New York Times. “Today, we face that threat in our own country, where the president of the United States is using the influence of our highest office to mount racist attacks on communities across the land. "
Trump on July 14 tweeted that Omar, as well as Democratic Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, should "go back" to their countries.
All four congresswomen of color, who are known colloquially as the "Squad," are U. S. citizens, and three were born in the U. S. Omar is a naturalized citizen and immigrated to the United States from Somalia over 20 years ago.
Omar and Tlaib are the only two Muslim women in the House of Representatives.

Several days after the president posted his initial tweets, chants of "send her back" erupted at a Trump rally in North Carolina when he brought up Omar. Trump initially condemned the chant, but later called those who attended the rally "patriots. "
In her op-ed, Omar said the chant "will be a defining moment in American history" that "reminds us of the grave stakes of the coming presidential election. "
"This fight is not merely about policy ideas; it is a fight for the soul of our nation," she wrote. "The ideals at the heart of our founding — equal protection under the law, pluralism, religious liberty — are under attack, and it is up to all of us to defend them. "
Omar went on to say that what she sees as the president's efforts to stoke division and conflict among Americans serves to distract the public from the "very real and deep problems our country faces," such as climate change, growing inequality and achieving affordable health care.
She added that it is not enough to condemn Trump's rhetoric and racism -- like that embodied in the attacks he has leveled recently at her and the three other Democratic congresswomen. She writes that Americans must "affirmatively confront" Trump's "racist policies," which she said include "caging of immigrant children at the border," "the banning of Muslim immigrants," and "the allowing of segregation in public housing. "
Trump's rhetoric is also impacting other countries, Omar warned.
"Right-wing nationalism in Hungary, Russia, France, Britain and elsewhere is on the march in ways not seen in decades," she wrote. "America has been a beacon of democratic ideals for the world. If we succumb to the fever of right-wing nationalism, it will have consequences far beyond our borders. "

More: Trump stood in front of a fake presidential seal. Here's what the real seal looks like
Omar went on to say that she believes that Americans need to look back at moments like the civil rights movement to move past Trump's rhetoric and policies.
"The proudest moments in our history — from the Emancipation Proclamation to the civil rights movement to the struggle against fascism — have come when we fight to protect and expand basic democratic rights," she said.
"Today, democracy is under attack once again," Omar concluded. "It’s time to respond with the kind of conviction that has made America great before. "

Moon-landing anniversary brings up great books

Texto completo: If the 50th anniversary of the moon landing made you nostalgic or curious to learn more, I've got some recommendations for you. In our home, the topic of space exploration comes up fairly regularly. During my newspaper days, I was editor of FLORIDA TODAY, the Space Coast newspaper, and my husband was a science teacher there. We had the opportunity to meet many astronauts, including Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin and Alan Shepard. A copy of The Shreveport Times moon landing front page hangs in our home, and it's always fun to pull out books about our heroes.
Two moon exploration must-reads
Take a look at "Moon Shot: The Inside Story of America's Race to the Moon," one of the best behind-the-scene looks at our space efforts. Written by Alan Shepard and Deke Slayton, the book's introduction is by Neil Armstrong. Veteran aerospace journalists Jay Barbree and Howard Benedict helped write this book, and it's a gem. (And we're delighted to own a copy signed to us by the late Shephard and Barbree.)
Another excellent book, specifically about the Apollo missions, is Andrew Chaikin's "A Man on the Moon: The Voyages of the Apollo Astronauts." Astronauts have called this the definitive book on their missions to the moon, and it offers an inside look at the heroic occasion we've been celebrating this week. This book is available in paperback and also as a beautiful boxed set, filled with pictures. (The boxed set is somewhat pricey unless you can find it at a used bookstore.)
Bossier libraries collect school supplies
A thank you to the seven Bossier Parish library branches, helping support children as school starts with a school supply drive. Take a look at the library website for a list of supplies, which will go to children who cannot afford to acquire the items. Items needed range from backpacks to binders and spiral notebooks and will be collected until August 22.
Help Caddo libraries choose a book for the parish
Voting opened this week for Shreve Memorial Library's One Book One Parish campaign that unites Caddo Parish readers at the library's 21 branches during October. You have through August 4 to cast your ballot at any branch, on the library website or the library's Facebook page.
The three contenders:
"The King of Bones and Ashes" by J.D. Horn: Magic is seeping out of the world, leaving the witches who've relied on it for countless centuries increasingly hopeless. While the other witches watch their reality unravel, young Alice Marin is using magic's waning days to delve into the mystery of numerous disappearances in the occult circles of New Orleans. (Confession: I had never heard of this book before I saw it on this list. A reminder to me again that reading tastes differ! While I try to read about a variety of topics, I am not generally interested in magic — with the exception of Harry Potter. And I only read two of those.)
"Becoming" by Michelle Obama: As First Lady of the United States, the first African-American to serve in that role, she helped create a welcoming and inclusive White House, while establishing herself as a powerful advocate for women and girls in the U.S. and around the world. In her memoir, she chronicles the experiences that have shaped her, from her childhood on the South Side of Chicago to her years as an executive balancing the demands of motherhood and work, to her time spent at the world's most famous address. (I bought this book on audio and recently added a used hardback copy to my library.)
"Educated" by Tara Westover: Born to survivalists in the mountains of Idaho, Tara Westover was 17 the first time she set foot in a classroom. Her family was so isolated from mainstream society that there was no one to ensure the children received an education. Her quest for knowledge transformed her, taking her to Harvard and to Cambridge University. Only then would she wonder if she'd traveled too far, if there was still a way home. (Readers rave to me about this book. I saw the author talk about it on a book TV show but have not yet read it.)
Coming up: A column on choosing which books to keep
I'd love to hear how you decide which books to keep and which to get rid of. Email me: judy@judychristie.com. I'll send a new signed paperback copy of Lisa Wingate's "Before We Were Yours," No. 1 on the New York Times paperback bestseller list for seven weeks now, to the reader with the best comment. (Deadline for comments: August 1.)

Texto completo: It's phone season!
That's when companies like Samsung, Apple and Google begin releasing new mobile devices. The phone makers all get busy doing so in about a month -- which means it is also time to think about whether you need a new phone plan.
Buying a new phone is an ideal time to consider picking a new plan. For one, cellular networks and phones keep getting faster, meaning you will almost certainly use your next phone more and gobble up larger amounts of data than before. (If you share a family plan with data-hogging children, this will definitely happen.)
For another, in the last three months of the year, carriers sometimes run promotions offering discounts on new phones if you switch to their network. So if you do your homework, you could get both a discounted phone and a better plan.
Let's make one thing clear: You can't beat the house. Telecommunications is one of the world's most lucrative industries, and wireless carriers will turn a profit no matter what. That's why you must be judicious and pick a plan that maximizes value.
"Diving into carrier services is like diving into an ocean and trying to swim with sharks," said Toni Toikka, chief executive of Alekstra, a research company that studies phone bills. "Those animals are predators and you are prey. They will eat you sooner or later."
So it's best to get ahead of the curve. Choosing a phone plan is easier said than done, so I sought advice from Alekstra and teamed up with Wirecutter, a New York Times company that reviews products, to highlight some of the best wireless packages, whether for individuals, couples or families of four.
Here's a guide to choosing the right plan for you.
Prioritize network coverage
It doesn't matter what plan you pick if you end up on a network with lousy cell service, so choosing a carrier with strong coverage in your hometown is a good starting point.
How do you figure out what's good? One approach is to visit each carrier's website and look at their coverage maps, which offer a glimpse of whether they have cell towers deployed throughout your neighborhood.
But coverage maps offer an incomplete assessment. Say, for example, that Verizon's map says your neighborhood in New York is blanketed with cell service. If there are many Verizon subscribers living there, the network could lack the capacity to provide consistent service to everyone. So take coverage maps with a grain of salt.
For another measure of network quality, turn to independent tests on the carriers. PCMag, for example, recently published results on the fastest and most reliable networks. AT&T and Verizon were neck and neck, T-Mobile lagged only slightly behind Verizon and Sprint was a distant No. 4.
Word of mouth goes a long way. If you are thinking about switching to a carrier, check with friends in the neighborhood who subscribe to that network first for an assessment on speed and reliability. The more data you have, the better.
Measure your data consumption
How much data do we really need? This is a tough question because most of us don't know how many bytes we consume when we stream a song, load a photo on social media or send a message.
Everyone's data use varies, so you will have to look at your monthly data consumption and calculate an average. On your carrier's website, log in to your account and look up your data use summaries.
You can also check data use directly from your mobile device. Here's how to do that for each carrier:
■ For AT&T subscribers, place a phone call to *DATA# (*3282#). AT&T will send a text message showing the amount of megabytes you have used out of your monthly allotment.
■ Verizon subscribers can place a call to #DATA (#3282). Verizon will send a text message containing a report of data use.
■ Sprint customers can send a text containing the word "Usage" to the number 1311. Sprint will respond with a message containing a data summary.
■ T-Mobile subscribers can place a call to #WEB# (#932#). T-Mobile will respond with a data summary.
Here's where things get tricky: If you plan to buy a new phone that is much faster than your current one, you should err on the side of buying more data. For example, if you have a five-year-old iPhone and use three gigabytes of data a month, and you intend to buy a new iPhone this fall, consider upgrading to a plan with five gigabytes. You will most likely use more data with a faster device.
Be wary of the fine print
Carriers offer plenty of attractive perks, like free international roaming packages and so-called unlimited data, to persuade you to switch to their networks. Don't let these perks drive your decision because there are always caveats, Mr. Toikka said.
For example, T-Mobile offers free international roaming, which lets you use a cellular data connection in more than 200 countries at no extra charge. The caveat is that free roaming only gets you access to slow wireless speeds, and you have to pay extra if you want faster internet access. (If you want to travel with your phone, you are probably better off using a foreign SIM card, as I detailed in a previous guide.)
Unlimited data is another example. In the American wireless market, unlimited isn't truly unlimited. Virtually every unlimited plan has some form of a cap, or a threshold that, once surpassed, results in slower data speeds. So if you have a dream of using an unlimited phone plan as your primary internet connection at home, it's not going to happen.
Wirecutter's picks
If you want to skip the homework, Wirecutter identified a few plans that are suitable for some typical lifestyles:
■ The best plan for most people on a single line: Verizon's five-gigabyte plan. This package includes more data than most people need, and the carrier has the best coverage in most parts of the country. It costs $ 55 a month if you enroll in automatic payments.
■ The best plan for data hogs: T-Mobile's Magenta unlimited plan. If you guzzle copious amounts of data, T-Mobile's unlimited plan is reasonably priced at $ 70, and its network provides good coverage. (Just be aware that the unlimited plan has limits: If you use more than 50 gigabytes, you may notice reduced speeds until the next billing cycle.)
■ The best plan for couples: Consumer Cellular's two-line plan. A lesser-known brand, Consumer Cellular is a reseller of AT&T and T-Mobile services, and it consistently gets high customer satisfaction scores. This plan comes out to $ 65 for two lines with five gigabytes each, a generous amount of data for the price.
■ The best plan for a family of four: Consumer Cellular's four-line plan. Similar to the above plan, this one comes out to $ 105 for four lines with five gigabytes each. One caveat: If your family's data use exceeds 30 gigabytes, Consumer Cellular shuts off data service. For heavy data guzzlers, Metro by T-Mobile offers the best value at $ 130 for four lines of unlimited data.

Texto completo: [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox .]
As DoorDash grew to become the biggest on-demand food delivery app in the country, it began doing something unconventional with customers' tips: It used them mostly to subsidize its payments to delivery workers.
Even as it faced blistering criticism for the policy in February, DoorDash stuck with it.
No longer. DoorDash announced Tuesday night that it was dropping its tipping policy, which had effectively meant customers' tips were going to DoorDash rather than the person who delivered their meal.
The decision followed another round of outrage and customer complaints about the policy after a New York Times reporter described in an article what it was like to work as a food-app deliveryman.
DoorDash's reversal comes amid a broader debate about jobs and fair pay in the so-called gig economy, where workers have more flexibility but less stability and fewer benefits.
"Going forward," DoorDash's chief executive, Tony Xu, wrote on Twitter on Tuesday, "we're changing our model -- the new model will ensure that Dashers' earnings will increase by the exact amount a customer tips on every order. We'll have specific details in the coming days."
For DoorDash's 400,000 delivery workers, known as Dashers, the "specific details" hold the key to whether the decision actually increases the money that goes in their pockets.
Under the policy, which the company adopted in 2017, DoorDash began offering a guaranteed minimum payment for a delivery.
A tip paid through the app now went mostly to offsetting DoorDash's contribution toward the guarantee, rather than increasing the Dasher's pay.
DoorDash had said the system kept workers' pay consistent when customers tipped little or nothing. For example, if DoorDash guaranteed a worker $ 7 for a delivery and a customer did not tip, DoorDash would directly pay the worker $ 7.
But if the customer tipped $ 3 via the app, DoorDash would directly pay the worker only $ 4, then add on the $ 3 tip so that the worker would still get only $ 7.
While the announcement is good news for customers who would like to think that their tips are going to increase a worker's earnings, the implications are much less clear for the Dashers themselves.
On a forum for DoorDash workers on Reddit, some Dashers greeted the news with concern that DoorDash would simply pay them less to make up for the revenue it expected to lose after no longer being able to subsidize labor costs with tips.
"I'm worried that the orders will guarantee less now, but we get all the tips," wrote a Reddit user named Dmillz648. "Meaning a previously guaranteed 10-dollar order might now only guarantee 5 bucks, and you get a 2 dollar tip, meaning you got 7 bucks for that order."
"That's my worry too," replied a user named williams91. "And it saved me in times that I've been stiffed, so we'll have to see the model. I'm nervous but excited." A DoorDash spokeswoman did not immediately comment on whether the company would change its payouts to workers.
DoorDash, which was valued at $ 7.1 billion after a round of financing this year, has faced bad publicity about its tipping policy before.
In February, Instacart, a grocery delivery app, dropped a similar tipping policy in the wake of a shaming campaign, and DoorDash was pressured to follow suit.
At the time, Mr. Xu stood firm. "This is a model that is built with Dashers in mind," he said then. "The pay model is meant to make sure every order is worth fulfilling."
But after The Times published an article on Sunday about what it was like working for DoorDash and other food apps, the blowback reignited on social media.
Thousands of people blasted the company. Some swore they would tip Dashers only in cash from now on. Others said they had deleted the app altogether.
"I don't believe that a single person intends to give a tip to a multibillion dollar venture-backed start-up," a tech journalist, Louise Matsakis, wrote in a tweet that was retweeted thousands of times. "They are trying to tip the person who delivered their order. This deceptive model should be illegal."
All the other major delivery apps give workers 100 percent of tips, but their pay rates vary. In this reporter's very brief experience as a food delivery worker for multiple apps earlier this year, I typically made more on DoorDash orders than on orders for Uber Eats or Postmates.
For Instacart workers, that company's decision to scrap its unpopular tip policy has had mixed results. Some workers say that their pay has fallen.
In his Twitter thread last night, Mr. Xu wrote that DoorDash's average contribution to Dashers did not change after it adopted the tipping policy it is now dropping. Before adopting that policy, the company had paid workers a flat fee per delivery, plus any tip from the customer.
DoorDash says that in its recent surveys of Dashers, they overwhelmingly preferred the current system to the flat-fee model.
"But it's clear from recent feedback that we didn't strike the right balance. We thought we were doing the right thing by making Dashers whole when a customer left no tip," Mr. Xu wrote. DoorDash says customers do not tip 15 percent of the time.
"What we missed was that some customers who did tip would feel like their tip did not matter."
Counting tips toward a worker's wages is not a technique invented by tech companies. It is borrowed from the restaurant industry concept of a "tipped wage." But restaurant employees are covered by minimum-wage laws and laws that limit the amount of tips that can be counted toward those wages.
In New York City, for example, restaurants are allowed to count up to $ 5 per hour of a worker's tips toward the minimum wage, which ranges from $ 13.50 to $ 15 per hour.
There is no such thing as minimum wage in the piecework world of on-demand delivery.
Because delivery workers for apps are legally considered independent contractors, not employees -- they set their own hours and can accept or reject any job, though they have no ability to negotiate rates -- they have no wage protections.
But across the country, legislators and workers' advocates are pushing for change.
The California Senate is considering a bill that would reclassify hundreds of thousands of gig-economy workers as employees. It is opposed by Uber and Lyft, the ride-hailing giants.
In New York, a city councilman, Brad Lander, said on Tuesday that he was working to create a living-wage requirement for delivery workers, but warned that it would be complicated.
In Madison Square Park in Manhattan on Wednesday afternoon, Courtney Melton, a food delivery worker, said she was still trying to figure out what the news might mean.
Whatever changes DoorDash makes, she said, "they're going to put themselves first; that's what a business does."
Ms. Melton, 31, has worked for almost all the food delivery apps and said that she wished DoorDash had been more transparent about its tip policy.
"That's why they got so much backlash," she said. "All they had to do was be upfront. Just tell the consumer."

Historic Chicago Defender among Black media icons scaling back; others possibly closing

Texto completo: (TriceEdneyWire.com) - It has been a rough few days for the Black media.
First, Ebony magazine and its sister publication, JET magazine, may be closing their doors for good.
And then the publisher of the storied Chicago Defender newspaper announced last week that it will no longer publish a print version.
In announcing the move to digital-only beginning Thursday, July 11, Real Times Media CEO Hiram E. Jackson said last Friday that the newspaper has made significant investment in digital media because of changes in the publishing landscape.
Jackson noted the Defender currently prints 16,000 newspapers. He said the newspaper reaches at least 10 times more people on its digital platform.
Jackson said Real Times' other newspapers, the Michigan Chronicle and the New Pittsburgh Courier, will continue to offer a print version.
The newspaper was founded in 1905 by Robert S. Abbott and reached the peak of its influence at mid-century when it was a frequent critic of racial inequities in the nation's Southern states.
The Defender delivered news of monumental events - the funeral of Emmett Till, the death of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., the election of President Obama - but also of everyday life for Black Americans.
Jackson said the decision was an economic one. Newspapers throughout the industry have seen a decline in print advertising and readers turning to the Internet.
Black newspapers often are an afterthought when it comes to advertising dollars, Jean Patterson Boone, publisher of the Richmond Free Press told the New York Times.
Regardless of the financial challenges, the Richmond Free Press, which has a weekly circulation of 35,000 and a draw of around 130,000 readers, has no intention of going the way of The Defender and eliminating its print edition.
"We're a miracle," Mrs. Boone told the New York Times. "We are a miracle and most Black newspapers are a miracle."
The National Newspaper Publishers Association, a trade organization for African-American-owned newspapers, currently counts 218 such publications across 40 states that attract 22.2 million readers between print and online each week.
Although the country may look different now, the enduring challenges of racism make the Black press just as essential now, said Benjamin Chavis Jr., NNPA's president and chief executive.
As for Ebony and JET, former employees of the company took to Twitter last week using the hashtag #EbonyOwes to air their frustrations with the company, as it has fired all of its employees with little to no notice.
According to USA Today, members of Ebony magazine's digital team say they've been fired and haven't received their final paychecks in the latest controversy to hit the struggling publication that has chronicled Black life in America for decades.
Michael Gibson, co-chairman and founder of Austin, Texas-based Clear View Group, which owns Ebony, declined to comment to USA TODAY on the digital team's dismissal, citing a "policy of not commenting on any employment practices or issues."
The Chicago Tribune previously reported how Ebony was being pressed by the National Writers Union to pay more than $200,000 it alleged the magazine owed to freelance writers who contributed stories back in 2017. The drama sparked the hashtag #EbonyOwes on Twitter.
According to a report on Ebony.com, the magazine's previous owner, Johnson Publishing Co., filed for bankruptcy liquidation in April, which Ebony said would not affect its operations.
"EBONY Media Operations, LLC brands, which include EBONY magazine, EBONY.com, digital magazine JET and jetmag.com and its related businesses, have viably operated independently of Johnson Publishing Company dba/ Fashion Fair Cosmetics (JPC) since Black-owned Ebony Media Operations, LLC (EMO) purchased the media assets of JPC in 2016. Black-owned investment firm CVG Group LLC assisted in the formation of EMO," a statement read. "EMO is unaffected by the Chapter 7 bankruptcy announcement regarding the dissolution of JPC. EMO is not able to comment further and is not familiar with the facts or events of the JPC business."
The first issue of the iconic magazine hit stands 74 years ago and took the industry by storm. Founded by John H. Johnson in November 1945, the Black-owned publication has always strived to address African American issues, personalities and interests in a positive and self-affirming manner.
Timeless editions of Ebony featured some of the biggest stars in Black America, including issues covered by Diana Ross, Sidney Poitier, as well as President and First Lady Barack and Michelle Obama.

Texto completo: You’d be forgiven for assuming the new Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run attraction has had the most riders of any Disneyland attraction since Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge opened — but you’d be off by a long shot.
Disneyland announced last week that 1 million riders have ridden the Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run attraction since Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge debuted. That statistical peek behind the curtain tells us a lot about the ride capacity of the E-Ticket attraction and the number of people visiting the new themed land .
The Ridgeway family of Ocean Springs, Miss. were recognized as the 1 millionth riders of Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run on July 16, according to Disneyland.
Touring Plans, which uses big data and statistical analysis to calculate daily crowd sizes and ride wait times at theme parks, says that based on the available information Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run has averaged about 27,000 riders per day since May 31, approximately 76% of the attraction’s ride capacity.
That pales in comparison to It’s a Small World (57,000 riders per day) and Pirates of the Carribbean (55,000) during the same period and is just short of Big Thunder Mountain (35,000), Hyperspace Mountain (31,000) and Indiana Jones Adventure (31,000), according to Touring Plans estimates.
You read that right: The half century-old Small World has had way more riders than the 2-month-old Smugglers Run.
But of course, Small World and Pirates are high-capacity people-eater rides that vacuum up visitors and often still manage to maintain relatively short wait times.
Disneyland officials said Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run has performed extremely well with very little downtime during the million-rider run thanks to the hard work and dedication of cast members and Walt Disney Imagineering, the creative arm of the company.
“Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run is among our highest rated attractions and we are thrilled by the guest reviews we have received since opening,” Disneyland officials said in a statement.

Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge officially debuted on May 31 after a series of employee and media previews. Disneyland instituted a reservation-only period for Galaxy’s Edge that ran through June 23. Beginning June 24, the new Star Wars land was opened to all visitors. A virtual queue boarding pass system put in place to manage crowds has been rarely used.
While the million-rider mark sounds impressive, other Disneyland attractions likely outpaced Smugglers Run during the same period.
During Smugglers million-rider run, Small World and Pirates could have hit the same mark operating at approximately 45% of their hourly capacity while Big Thunder could have done it at 70% capacity and Hyperspace Mountain at 80%, according to Touring Plans.
Smuggler’s Run can accommodate up to 1,800 riders per hour, according to the New York Times.
The average wait time for Smugglers Run dropped from 47 minutes on opening day to 22 minutes on June 23, according to Touring Plans data. The average Smugglers Run wait time spiked to 59 minutes on June 24 — the first day guests could enter the land without a reservation — and reached a high of 89 minutes over the Fourth of July holiday weekend.
Using Smugglers Run ridership as a guide, Touring Plans estimates that Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge has attracted between 2.7 million and 5 million visitors since opening day.
“My strong suspicion is that the number is toward the bottom end of that range based on the low wait times we saw throughout June,” said Len Testa, president of Touring Plans, an online subscription service that lets users create custom theme park itineraries.
Disneyland rarely if ever talks about attendance numbers or ridership figures.
Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run is the lone anchor attraction in Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge until the Rise of the Resistance dark ride debuts on Jan. 17, six months behind schedule.
To the surprise of many theme park observers, Disneyland has experienced lighter than usual summertime traffic since Galaxy’s Edge opened May 31.

Bullpen has its moments, once again, but criticism is misplaced, once again

Texto completo: Someone handed out another round of T-shirts in the Twins' clubhouse Tuesday afternoon.
They were distributed to Twins relievers.
They bore no words, just a picture, of a fire extinguisher.
They did not appear to be ironic.
"Pretty cool," reliever Ryne Harper said.
While the Twins' bullpen becomes Minnesota's biggest crisis since the New York Times accused us of loving something called "grape salad," Twins' relievers are trying not to be offended at becoming a similarly unpopular concoction.
And they're succeeding. At not being offended.
"Here's what I think about it," said Taylor Rogers, the Twins' best reliever. "Nobody's going to criticize our hitting, because we have more homers than anybody. We've pretty much had the same five starters all season -- can't criticize them. Our defense is great, we've got the best center fielder in baseball, so who's left?
"It's us. I talked with Trev (May) about that specific thing. There is nothing to criticize … so we're there to criticize."
Rogers said that before the bullpen continued to create more over-the-top drama to American society than anyone since Quentin Tarantino, allowing seven runs over the eighth and ninth innings in the latest arena football game played at Target Field. The wild 10-inning clash ended in a 14-12 loss.
Twins games have become a blend of WrestleMania, randomly-aimed fireworks and drunken cricket, and while Twins' relievers are part of one of the best teams in franchise history, so far, the average Twins fan wouldn't touch many of them without donning a Hazmat suit.
Can the Twins win big this year without making a trade? A state's nerves say no. History says yes.
Lost amid the confetti and champagne of the '87 and '91 championship seasons is the state of those team's bullpens.
In '87, closer Jeff Reardon had a 4.48 ERA. If he was performing to that level in 2019, Twins fans would be asking for his release.
Reardon's setup men in '87? Juan Berenguer (3.94 ERA), George Frazier (4.98 ERA) and Keith Atherton (4.54 ERA).
In '91, Rick Aguilera (2.35 ERA) was an outstanding closer. His setup men were journeyman Carl Willis (a career-best 2.63 ERA), Steve Bedrosian (4.42 ERA) and Mark Guthrie (4.32 ERA.)
Those teams won with powerhouse lineups, excellent fielding, top-heavy rotations and bullpens that got just enough outs at just the right times. That almost sounds familiar.
The 1987 Twins made one move for pitching at the trade deadline: Acquiring Steve Carlton, who would compile a 6.70 ERA in nine games. The '91 Twins made zero trade deadline deals.
The thing about relievers is that they're unpredictable by nature. Most of them failed as starters, and had to remake themselves as long or middle relievers.
Eddie Guardado made himself into a starting pitching prospect in the Twins' organization, got hammered when he came to the big leagues, then became a one-out lefty, then a reliable middle reliever, then a setup man, and then an All-Star closer.
Nobody saw that coming, including Eddie.
So the key to this year's bullpen could be a fan-pleasing trade, or it could be May figuring out how to pair his impressive fastball with a corner-seeking breaking pitch, or Lewis Thorpe becoming the next Carl Willis. Or Cody Allen or Fernando Romero pitching to their capabilities.
"With our hitters striking back like they do, we just want to keep the game where it's at, not wreck all their hard work," Rogers said.
Rogers is better now than Reardon was in '87. The Twins' other top relievers resemble those on the '87 and '91 teams. With the ball flying out of ballparks at a record pace, what the Twins need is bullpen depth.
When Twins relievers fail, they are identified as the team's foremost problem. When they succeed, do they celebrate?
"Not really," Rogers said.
"We did with Thorpe, with his first win -- what he did was pretty impressive.
But you don't need to be patted on the back for doing your job."
But you may get a T-shirt, whether planted by a believer or a comic, out of the deal.

I saw the KKK burn crosses in North Carolina. 'Send her back' chants can't shock me now.

Texto completo: HILLSBOROUGH, N. C. — In the summer of 1976, I first drove through the town of Smithfield, North Carolina. I was 19 and had just finished my sophomore year in college. The following day I planned to start a summer internship bringing health and legal services to the migrant farm workers — mostly African Americans — who traveled the East Coast each season to pick sweet potatoes, cucumbers and tobacco. As I approached the town, a giant and frightening billboard suddenly appeared roadside.
“This is Klan Country," it said. 'LOVE IT or LEAVE IT. Help fight communism and integration. Welcome to Smithfield”
For those unfamiliar with the highways and byways of North Carolina, Smithfield is but 70 miles from Greenville, North Carolina, the site of President Donald Trump’s rally where chants of “send her back” echoed last week. More than 40 years later, the refrain really hasn’t changed. Substitute “socialism” for “communism” and "immigration" for "integration. "
The past is never really past
Like many other white people coming of age in the 1970s, I had heard terrifying stories of the Ku Klux Klan’s violence. But I was unaware that this hate group had for the most part remained active and powerful in many parts of the Tar Heel state, especially in the mid-1960s. Chalk that up to my naiveté — and outsider status (I grew up in New York City).
It has happened to every immigrant: Bullies told me to go back to my country. At first it silenced me, now it spurs me on.
Upon graduation, I took a job in another isolated North Carolina county, just a few miles from Mount Airy, the birth place of Andy Griffith and the model for the town of Mayberry, the fictional and pastoral home to “The Andy Griffith Show. ” With a small state salary, I rented a trailer home from a white couple who showed me every courtesy but, fortunately, never asked me about my job — to ferry Hispanic farm workers from the migrant camps to health clinics. In retrospect, I’m sure my whiteness made my approval pro forma.
In a few short weeks, having paid my weekly rent on time, the talkative landlord began to confide in me. Not quite mano a mano. More like blanco a blanco.
Among the revelations: His membership in the local KKK chapter. Soon enough, he invited me to a Klan gathering, again my white skin appeared to tell my story. By then 21 years old, I was less naive than when I first encountered the Klan billboard in Smithfield. A foolhardy (to put it mildly) young man, I agreed to go along. Out in an open field, I witnessed a cross burning, the wearing of robes and a sea of Confederate flags in support of white nationalism. The rabid hatefulness of that dark night shocked me. It also terrified me: There was more to me than my skin color. I was of Jewish blood and then a closeted gay man, both disqualifying marks in the eyes of the Klan.
I left North Carolina the following year, never expecting to return. But I did in 2006 when my husband and I moved to Chapel Hill from the Bay Area to be nearer our ailing parents. All too soon the DNA of hate manifested itself, notably with the passage in 2016 of House Bill 2, what’s known as the “bathroom bill,” that mercilessly targeted transgender people for using the wrong restroom.
The law (yes, it was passed and signed into law, in the after hours of darkness) was mean-spirited and fear-based — and some of the surrounding rhetoric reminded me of what I had witnessed decades before. Shock? If only.
Hate: A national epidemic
The year before, in 2015, my adopted home town of Hillsborough struggled with and finally decided to remove the words “Confederate Memorial” from the local history museum. That action spurred a backlash as hundreds descended on our town in a protest. Along with them: Confederate flags, kids in “rebel” caps and parents in Stars and Bars T-shirts.
Enough: My black, disadvantaged students live with racism. They don't need to see it on sneakers.
“They’re gonna race as fast as they can to erase us off the face of the Earth,” one speaker told the crowd. The Raleigh News and Observer reported: “They eee-yowed the rebel yell on cue and intoned Dixie in unison, proclaiming that Southern culture and their way of life are in dire peril. ” Again, I felt the power of hate but not shock.
That’s the same reason I wasn’t shocked by the chants of “send her back” at Trump’s rally in Greenville on Wednesday. I wish I could tell you I was, that such ribald hate is out of character for many of my fellow Tar Heels or my fellow Americans. But it is not.
I wish I could attribute it all to Donald Trump — a man who thrives on race hate, the fear of difference, and the disruption of social mores and manners. But I can’t. I wish I could say North Carolina is an exception to the rule in these United States, but it is not. If I’ve learned anything in my two residencies in North Carolina, it’s as William Shakespeare wrote, "The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves. "

Gotham Bar and Grill Names Replacement for Head Chef

Texto completo: Alfred Portale, the chef whose name has been synonymous for 34 years with Gotham Bar and Grill, a mainstay near Union Square, is no longer in the kitchen there. He has been replaced as executive chef by Victoria Blamey, who rose to prominence as the executive chef at Chumley's, in the West Village, from 2016 to 2017.
Mr. Portale, who plans to open his own restaurant, Portale, this fall in Chelsea, left the job several weeks ago, after his business partners -- Jerome Kretchmer, Jeff Bliss, Robert Rathe and Richard Rathe -- decided to change the direction of the restaurant.
Mr. Portale, 65, took charge of the kitchen in 1985, a year after Gotham opened, and remains a partner. In an interview on Tuesday, he said that discussions about updating the restaurant began a few years ago. "At first I was involved in the process," Mr. Portale said. "But finally, it did not happen the way I would have liked it to."
He said he informed his partners in January that he had signed a lease for the new restaurant, hoping that would give him time to train a new chef for Gotham. But then the search for a replacement kicked into high gear, he said, and his partners shut him out of the process.
Mr. Kretchmer, one of the partners, said, "We wanted to make some changes, and Alfred was a little uncomfortable with the changes we wanted. Also Alfred opening another restaurant was not consistent with what we wanted to do."
It's not uncommon for a prominent chef to run more than one restaurant. Mr. Portale himself once ran Gotham Steak in Miami Beach.
Still, Mr. Kretchmer said that "the whole thing was amicable -- there are no hard feelings." The partners plan to close briefly in August to make some cosmetic changes to the restaurant. "It will have a different future," he said. "We're still working out the details."
Using an employment recruiter, the partners interviewed a number of chefs before choosing Ms. Blamey, 39. A native of Santiago, Chile, who worked at restaurants in Spain and Australia before coming to New York for stints at Corton, Atera, Il Buco Alimentari e Vineria and Upland. Her work at the renovated Chumley's drew a two-star review from Pete Wells of The New York Times.
"Chumley's is emphatically worth going to," he wrote, "as long as Ms. Blamey remains content to work in that kitchen."
Ms. Blamey, who has been cooking in pop-ups since leaving Chumley's, is developing her menu gradually. She said she expected to keep Gotham's steak and caviar services when the new menu debuts in September.
She also said she wanted to add some multiculturalism to the fare. The restaurant has long been known for Mr. Portale's often trendsetting new-American cuisine, which Sam Sifton awarded three stars in a 2011 review in The Times.
"This is a multicultural city, so the menu will be a melting pot," she said. "Maybe some kind of Indian sauce. Or whatever chiles I see in the market."
Mr. Portale, asked what Gotham Bar and Grill would be like without him, said, "I've gotten used to the idea, but most people would find it shocking that I'm no longer there."

N.B.A. Is Said to Open Salary Cap Investigation

Texto completo: The N.B.A. has begun an investigation into how teams handled free agency this summer, focusing on whether improper inducements were offered to players to circumvent the salary cap, according to a person with direct knowledge of the situation.
The issue was raised by multiple team owners at a meeting of the league's board of governors this month in Las Vegas, according to the person, who requested anonymity because of a lack of authorization to speak publicly on the subject.
ESPN first reported on the existence of the investigation.
There were also multiple reports this month suggesting that Kawhi Leonard's representatives, in arranging his blockbuster move from the Toronto Raptors to the Los Angeles Clippers, had asked for perks that would violate the league's collective bargaining agreement.
The ESPN commentator Stephen A. Smith, citing "people in N.B.A. circles," said on the air that Leonard's uncle -- Dennis Robertson (known in N.B.A. circles as "Uncle Dennis") -- had asked other teams for houses, planes and guaranteed sponsorship money. Smith added, "I have no idea whether this is true or not."
In another report, The Sports Network in Canada said Robertson had asked for "things players don't generally ask for in standard contract negotiations," without specifying what those things might be.
It is unclear what the scope of the investigation is, or whether the league, which declined to comment, is acting on information other than reports in the news media. The investigation follows one of the most tumultuous off-seasons in N.B.A. history, with many high-profile players switching teams.
The N.B.A. is also exploring whether it needs to change its rules against tampering. Several players committed to signing with a team as soon as free agency negotiations officially opened at 6 p.m. on June 30 -- even though teams were not allowed to begin recruiting before then. League rules prohibit players, coaches and front office executives from enticing an athlete under contract with another team to come play for their franchise.
Commissioner Adam Silver said during an interview with Sports Illustrated in April that he did not think tampering was significantly worse today than in the past. But after the spirited board of governors meeting, Silver acknowledged that changes might be necessary. He cited increased coverage of the league and communication through social media as reasons teams and players might feel pressure to push the established boundaries.
"I think it's pointless at the end of the day to have rules that we can't enforce. I think it hurts the perception of integrity around the league," Silver said at a news conference in Las Vegas. He added later, "My sense in the room today was, especially when it comes to free agency and the rules around it, that we've got work to do."
A number of deals seemed to be completed at breakneck speed. Kemba Walker committed to the Boston Celtics and Kyrie Irving to the Nets almost immediately when free agency began, and the likelihood of the moves was essentially known for days.
Also close to the time free agency started, Kevin Durant posted a video on Instagram announcing his decision to leave the Golden State Warriors and become a Net. The video appeared on the account of "The Boardroom," Durant's sports business channel.
Several news media reports indicated that his teaming up with Irving had long been in the works.
The New York Times reported last month that representatives for Leonard, now the centerpiece of the Clippers, had made it known that he was interested in teaming up with Jimmy Butler, who was becoming a free agent. In addition, according to an ESPN report, Leonard tried to recruit Durant days before he officially committed to the Nets.
(Nets General Manager Sean Marks said at N.B.A. Summer League that Durant had committed on Instagram before ever meeting with the team.)
On ESPN's website, testimonials from two players -- the Milwaukee Bucks' Khris Middleton and the Philadelphia 76ers' Tobias Harris -- were posted within minutes of each other at around 7 p.m. on June 30, an hour after free agency technically began, to explain why they were staying with their teams.
Agents for several other players, including Jonas Valanciunas, Terrence Ross and Gerald Green, confirmed to The Times, ESPN, The Athletic and other outlets that their players had committed to teams within minutes of free agency opening. Bobby Portis told The Athletic that the Knicks had reached out to set up a meeting a full five days before free agency began.
"The one strong conviction I have is that we should not have rules that are not strictly enforced," Silver said in Las Vegas. "We know that's the case right now. Whether that's by virtue of practice, whether it's because just the world around us has changed, whether it's because players have power that they didn't used to have, I'm not so sure."
There is some precedent for under-the-table deals that break league rules. It was discovered that Joe Smith, a No. 1 draft pick who played in the N.B.A. from 1995 to 2011, had signed short-term deals with the Minnesota Timberwolves that were less than his market value, with a secret promise that he would eventually get a more lucrative contract. The N.B.A. handed down what at the time was the harshest penalty ever from an American sports league: a $ 3.5 million fine and the stripping of five Minnesota first-round picks.

Michigan beauty queen ousted over Twitter posts

Texto completo: The tiara went to Kathy Zhu, but one day after she had been crowned Miss Michigan by the Miss World America organization, the beauty queen was stripped of her title.
Racially and religiously charged comments Zhu had made on Twitter came to the attention of pageant organizers, who ruled that they violated the competition's rules of "good character."
After a flurry of text messages and emails between Zhu, 20, and organizers, she was told the competition would no longer recognize her and she was to stop mentioning or using images of herself as the pageant's winner.
Zhu, a conservative activist who is a University of Michigan senior and the social media director for the national group Chinese Americans for Trump, shared on social media an email she had received Thursday from the pageant's state director, Laurie DeJack.
"It has been brought to the attention of Miss World America 'MWA' that your social media accounts contain offensive, insensitive and inappropriate content," Dejack wrote.
The first tweet that drew the scrutiny of the pageant came in response to criticism of police officers about the Black Lives Matter movement.
"Did you know the majority of black deaths are caused by other blacks?" Zhu wrote on Twitter in October 2017. "Fix problems within your own community first before blaming others."
In February 2018, in a tweet she has since deleted, Zhu criticized a World Hijab Day awareness event at the University of Central Florida, where she had been a student before transferring.
"There's a 'try a hijab on' booth at my college campus," Zhu wrote at the time. "So you're telling me that it's now just a fashion accessory and not a religious thing? Or are you just trying to get women used to being oppressed under Islam."
Zhu said in an interview Saturday that her tweets had been taken out of context and that she was punished for her conservative views. She said that not wanting to wear a hijab did not make her an Islamophobe.
This was the first pageant entered by Zhu, who is now disqualified from advancing to the Miss World America pageant in October in Las Vegas.
"They just immediately assumed that I was a racist," said Zhu, vice president of the College Republicans at the University of Michigan. "They should have let me explain myself."
Dejack declined to comment Saturday and referred questions to the Miss World America organization, an international competition that dates to 1951.
The organization's national director, Michael Galanes, and its chief operating officer, Robert Gandara, did not respond to messages seeking comment. There was no immediate word on who would replace Zhu.
Zhu is not the first beauty pageant contestant to be embroiled in controversy.
In 2009, Carrie Prejean Boller, who was the first runner-up nationally in the Miss USA pageant, faced a backlash when she was asked whether she supported same-sex marriage and answered that marriage should be between a man and a woman.
"There was a huge outcry about this," said professor Hilary Levey Friedman, an author, sociologist and beauty pageant expert.
Boiler, who also drew attention for seminude photos, was fired as Miss California USA by pageant organizers, including Donald Trump, because, they said, she did not fulfill her contractual obligations to make required public appearances.
Erika Harold, who was Miss America in 2003 and ran unsuccessfully for Congress and for Illinois attorney general as a Republican, caused a stir for promoting an abstinence education program.
Levey Friedman pointed out that pageant winners with liberal views, such as Kate Shindle, the 1998 Miss America who pushed for AIDS education and distributing condoms in schools, have also caused controversy.
Vanessa Williams, the actress and singer, surrendered her crown as the first Black Miss America in 1984 after revelations that Penthouse magazine was about to publish nude photos she had posed for when she was a photographer's assistant. In 2015, the chief executive of Miss America apologized to Williams for the way the controversy had been handled.
Blain Roberts, a history professor at Fresno State University in California who has written about pageants, said competitions such as Miss America have strict rules that contestants must never have been married and must adhere to a code of conduct.
"You had to sign a pledge as a contestant guaranteeing that you had not engaged in any acts of moral turpitude," Roberts said.
Zhu, who has galvanized many conservatives across the country, said she stands by her social media comments but the whole flap could have been avoided.
"They should have vetted me better before they allowed me to be crowned," she said.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Two Louisiana police officers were fired Monday, just days after one of them wrote in a Facebook post that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is a "vile idiot" who should be shot.
Gretna, La. , police officers Charlie Rispoli, who create the post, and Angelo Varisco, who liked the post online, were fired, police chief Author Lawson announced in a press conference Monday.
"These officers have certainly acted in a manner which was unprofessional, alluding to the violent act to be conducted against a sitting U. S. congressman, a member of our government, we're not going to tolerate that," Lawson said at the news conference, according to the New York Times. "This incident, we feel, has been an embarrassment to our department. "
Rispoli, a 14-year veteran of the department, shared a blog post that falsely claims the New York Democrat said "We pay soldiers too much," according to a screenshot of the post taken by The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate.
What happened: Louisiana police officer's Facebook post says Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez 'needs a round,' report says
More: President Trump's job approval rating reaches high mark in NPR/PBS/Marist poll after racist tweets
"This vile idiot needs a round," Rispoli's wrote in the post. "And I don't mean the kind she used to serve," he added, referring to Ocasio-Cortez's time working as a bartender.
The social media post and resulting firings came amid mounting concern for elected officials' safety in the current political climate.
Ocasio-Cortez, along with Reps. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, have been the target of President Donald Trump's ire in the past week. He has repeatedly criticized the four progressive Democrats and called on them to "go back" to their countries. All four congresswomen are U. S. citizens, with three being born in the United States.
Trump's comments led leading Democrats on Capitol Hill to inquire about additional security for Omar and other lawmakers.
More: Tlaib: 'I'm not going nowhere, not until I impeach' Trump
More: Geraldo Rivera on Trump 'go back' tweets: His critics 'were much more right than I'
The New York Democrat just last week questioned Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan about threatening messages about her – including Photoshopped images depicting her being rape – in a secret Facebook group for current and former Border Patrol agents.
At Monday's press conference, Lawson said that both officers who were fired had worked the streets as patrol officers.
However, Lawson said he did not think that Rispoli meant any harm and just got "caught up in the heat of the moment. "

How true crime documentaries helped Erin Lee Carr move forward after her father's death

Texto completo: When David Carr died, he left behind 1,946 pieces of digital correspondence with his daughter.
His death had been sudden: In 2015, he collapsed in the newsroom of the New York Times, where he served as the paper’s renowned media columnist. An autopsy would later reveal he had lung cancer; he was 58.
And so in the wake of her father’s unexpected death, Erin Lee Carr clung to every email, each G-chat they’d exchanged. She saw in him the same demons that plagued her – the call to alcohol and drugs, an unbridled need to achieve that he once described to her as a kind of birthright: “You are a Carr, and that is a complicated, wondrous inheritance. That means you are tough, you are smart, you are someone others want to be around. But it also means that mistakes of hubris, excess, and indulgence will stalk you.”
When he died, she was 26, in the early stages of a documentary filmmaking career that he had helped her launch. He’d long been eager to help her find success, and she did not eschew his guidance.
He connected her with industry contacts he’d interviewed, like Shane Smith, the former CEO of Vice – the company where she’d go on to land her first job. He spruced up a pitch letter she’d written to Judd Apatow, tossing in some of his distinctive prose. And after she was fired from Vox Media, he reached out to Andrew Rossi – the filmmaker who’d trained his lens on the journalist in 2011’s “Page One: Inside the New York Times” – asking if the director would have coffee with his kid.
It was a meeting that proved instrumental for Carr, leading her to make four documentaries for HBO. Two of those projects are being released in quick succession: In May, the network aired “At the Heart of Gold: Inside the USA Gymnastics Scandal,” a film she made about the sexual abuse inflicted on dozens of young female athletes by team doctor Larry Nassar.
And on Tuesday came the first in a two-part docuseries, “I Love You, Now Die: The Commonwealth Vs. Michelle Carter,” about a 17-year-old who seemingly encouraged her boyfriend to commit suicide via text message.
Both are coming out on the heels of the April publication of her first book, a memoir about her relationship with her dad called “All That You Leave Behind.” The confluence of events has led to a flurry of attention for Carr, now 31, and interviews on NPR’s “Fresh Air” with Terry Gross and “Armchair Expert,” the popular podcast hosted by Dax Shepard – the kind of recognition her dad knew well, something he simultaneously pushed her toward and cautioned her against.
“As soon as you figure out the job, or the case, or the story, there will be another,” he wrote in an 2014 email to Carr that she shares in her book. “The reward for achievement is a hunger for more, a blessing that lives inside a curse.”

Texto completo: Need a cool way to chill out this long, hot summer -- both physically and aesthetically? You can't ask for better relief from the heat than Krannert Center for the Performing Arts' Stage 5 and this Thursday's installment of the Krannert Uncorked series. Come to the cabaret, old chum ...
This week's free musical performance, accompanied by the clinking of wine glasses and the tasting of fine vintages, features the Katie Flynn Quartet consisting of Champaign jazz and cabaret singer Katie Flynn backed by Kurt Reeder (piano), Crystal Rebone (bass) and John Sergel (drums). Flynn was gracious enough to answer a few questions in advance of Thursday's performance:
Can you give us a sneak peek at what will be on your program Thursday? How does your performance with a quartet differ from those with larger ensembles -- more jazz as opposed to show tunes -- or do you prefer a mix of both?
My favorite thing about performing is the connection everyone feels through the powerful energy of music. ... This Thursday's performance at Krannert is going to be a lot of fun. I'll be performing with Kurt Reeder on piano, Crystal Rebone on bass and John Sergel on drums. These three remarkable musicians are all doing grad/post-grad work at the school of music here at U of I, and trust me, they are amazing. I'm honored to even be in the presence of such craftsmanship, brilliant musicianship, and they're also fantastic humans! The show will be featuring a lot of timeless jazz standards, a few show tunes and maybe a few surprises. I always love to get a crowd laughing, so there will definitely be some humor and perhaps a bit of banter, just for kicks.
Krannert is one of my favorite places to experience the arts, and I'm really looking forward to an evening where I can share some music and laughs with the community.
I recall hearing you say a couple years ago that you loved Broadway show tunes and had been inspired by the likes of Bette Midler, Patti LuPone, Barbra Streisand, Carol Channing, etc. Do you have an absolute favorite Broadway show tune?
I definitely love certain Broadway show tunes, but I like to do them sparingly, so they don't lose their magic and luster. Bette Midler will always be my number one influence and favorite performer. She knows how to work a room, connect with the magic of song, and is such a funny lady. Barbra Streisand is up there, along with some of the greatest vocalists: Ella Fitzgerald, Nina Simone, Nancy Wilson, Anita O'Day, Edith Piaf and Kay Starr. I also adore Freddie Mercury, for showing me that it's not just about singing, it's about showmanship, stage presence and a touch of the grandiose. It would be accurate to say I love so many different kinds of music, especially when I can feel it, express it and connect with it.
Have a question, suggestion or fave nomination for Frank? We'd love to hear from you. Please email it to fpieper@news-gazette.com.
What I'm watching ...
There's more than one way to honor this nation's Native American heritage. PBS KIDS' 'Molly of Denali' offers a new one.
"Molly of Denali" breaks new ground with its casting of a Native American hero in a children's television series.
Nickelodeon's "Dora the Explorer," launched in 2000, cleared a path for more Latino representation on TV. Disney's "Doc McStuffins," wrapping up its fifth and final season, triggered more than $500 million in merchandise sales in 2013 -- a record for a toy line based on a black character, according to The New York Times.
But Molly Mabray is the first star of an animated children's show to be a proud, contributing member of a Native American tribe, sharing her adventures from her Alaska home with young viewers across the country. (Molly is voiced by 14-year-old Indigenous actress Sovereign Bill of Auburn, Wash., who is of Tlingit and Muckleshoot descent).
"We're going to see Molly and her friends doing everything from dogsledding to working in her garden to traveling with her mom, who is a bush pilot who can't land the plane because there's a moose in the runway," Lesli Rotenberg, PBS chief programming executive for children's media and education, told the Minneapolis Star Tribune. "We're highlighting important values, like knowing who you are, accepting what life brings and honoring your elders. While these values are specific to the Alaskan Native community, they're also universal."
That's the ticket!
Frank's best bets for the hottest concert tickets this week:
Tickets are on sale now for the Indigo Girls concert scheduled for Nov. 12 at the Virginia Theatre in downtown Champaign.
The Grammy Award-winning folk-rock duo from Atlanta, Ga., comprising Amy Ray and Emily Saliers, have been playing their music alongside symphony orchestras across the country (more than 50 to date) on their current extended tour, including a show with the Minnesota Orchestra in Minneapolis earlier this year and another scheduled for next month alongside the Utah Symphony in Park City, Utah. This on the heels of last year's live double album, "Indigo Girls Live with The University of Colorado Symphony Orchestra."
No word yet on whether the Indigo Girls will be joined on stage at the Virginia by the Champaign-Urbana Symphony Orchestra or Sinfonia da Camera, but until then, or in lieu thereof, you can catch the Girls' orchestral-based album in full at their Spotify page.
I can't wait!
'Therapeutic music for the soul' at Urbana's Downtown Get Down this Saturday
The second installment in Urbana's Downtown Get Down, an event series scheduled for the fourth Saturday of each month all summerlong, sounds like just the ticket on a hot midsummer's night this weekend.
Local groove group Ther.Up'Y -- which bills itself as "therapeutic music for the soul" -- will headline this Saturday's Main Street entertainment from about 6:30 to 8 p.m. Joining them onstage will be area gospel artists Danyell Tranise and LaJason Parker.
For a sneak preview of both vocalists on Spotify, check out Tranise's 2018 releases of "All You Need," "I'm Yours," "Peace Be Still," "You Made It" and "I Want More," and Parker's 2018 recording of "Jesus."
DJ Phunky Phil and Deejay Grapes will open Saturday's show from 5 to 6:30 p.m., spinning Latin and world beats, hip-hop and neo-soul.

The news avoiders have opted out

Texto completo: NPR in May changed the long-familiar theme music to its “Morning Edition” newscast.
After 40 years of hearing B.J. Leiderman’s original score every weekday, you were either sick of it, or, for sticks in the mud such as yours truly, flummoxed at the very idea of messing with a good thing.
But I’ll get over it. Especially ‘cause the new, poppy, synthy thing is just a rewrite of the old tune anyway. Same chord progression; a few tweaks.
The reason for the move by the public radio commissars in D.C.?
It was, as Josh Benton wrote for Nieman Lab, “for the kids.”
Meaning, trying to get a few listeners under 60 to listen to the show.
The New York Times wrote: “The new theme is intended to attract a younger and more diverse audience, while also aligning with the evolution of ‘Morning Edition’ into a newsier program, said Kenya Young, the executive producer. ‘I wanted a sound and a mood and a tone and a feel and a vibe all mixed in one,’ she said.”
Actual young people seem to consume as much radio news as they do daily print newspapers. Meaning, none. The only reason I know at least one 20something has ever listened to a second of NPR is that Clementine Creevy’s great L.A. rock band Cherry Glazerr takes its name from KCRW’s morning host Chery Glaser, who Clem used to hear in her parents’ car as they drove her to school.
So where do young people get their news? I know, I know, Instagram, fool.
But it’s not just Millennials who don’t follow the old-fashioned definition of what’s going on in the world. Academics who study the subject say that, at a time when it is far easier than ever to get an enormous amount of information about everything by clicking on the screen of that telephone in your pocket, many are simply opting out.
Josh Benton, again, for Nieman: “News, you may have noticed, isn’t that great at generating happiness these days. So lots of people are happy to stick to Keanu and avoid Trump/Iran/Putin/climate change/mass shootings/Brexit/racism entirely.”
Yes, of course, there have been plenty of times as terrifying as these, and people still followed — hungered for — the news. When the Third Reich was bombing London and on the brink of ruling Europe, that didn’t stop people from listening to Edward Murrow broadcasting from the rooftops. So mere logic won’t do here. Something else is going on.
As someone who learned to read at age 4 out of fascination with the morning newspaper, and haven’t stopped since, it doesn’t matter that this makes no sense to me. It’s a thing. Benton cites data from Digital News Report: “In 2017, 29 percent of those surveyed worldwide said they ‘often or sometimes avoid the news,’ including 38 percent in the United States and 24 percent in the U.K. By 2019, those numbers had increased to 32 percent worldwide (+3), 41 percent in the U.S. (+3) and 35 percent in the U.K. (+11). (Even the Japanese — the world’s most devoted news consumers — saw news avoidance increase from 6 to 11 percent.)”
Harshing their vibe is the major reason for news avoidance, 57 percent of the avoiders said: “It can have a negative effect on my mood.”
Second, yes, is the more than a third of us who have concocted a conspiracy theory about the press: “I can’t rely on news to be true,” say 35 percent. You want real untruthiness? Try the internet.
“I haven’t read a newspaper in years,” said one respondent. “It was all too depressing.”
I hear you, dude. But you want real depressing? Try a future in which the creeps and crooks we report on win the day because you decided to just tune out.

”Popotes Trump”, una burla a los esfuerzos por reducir plásticos. Costaban $15 y ya se agotaron

Texto completo: La campaña del presidente Donald Trump para la reelección 2020 está en pleno apogeo y toca arremeter contra todo lo que suene progresista. Al fin y al cabo, incluso los análisis del prestigioso diario The New York Times -poco sospechoso de ser trumpista- le auguran mejores resultados que en 2016, en parte por el tono beligerante del mandatario hacia sus rivales políticos.
En esta batalla discursiva, la nueva enemiga del candidato a la reelección es la lucha por la reducción de pláticos . El equipo de campaña del presidente sacó una serie de popotes (pajitas, pitillos, bombillas) “100% estadounidenses” para plantar cara a lo que considera una idea “progresista”: los popotes de papel .
Liberal paper straws don’t work.
STAND WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP and buy your pack of recyclable straws today!https://t.co/nanyEFK938
— Team Trump (@TeamTrump) July 18, 2019
“Las pajitas de papel son solo otro ejemplo de los fallidos excesos regulatorios liberales. Pero no temas, ¡el presidente Trump tiene la solución perfecta!”, escribió el director de la campaña de Trump, Brad Parscale, en un comunicado divulgado este viernes.
El asesor dijo que las de papel son “como las ideas liberales, que no funcionan y se vienen abajo al instante” e invitó a los usuarios a hacerse con ellas “hoy mismo”. Y le hicieron caso. Los “popotes Trump”, un pack de diez unidades a 15 dólares, se agotaron este mismo viernes.
Con esta campaña el mandatario insiste en su negacionismo ante el alarmante cambio climático y se burla del tremendo impacto que estos artículos tienen sobre el medio ambiente .
Las pajitas solo suponen el 4% de los desechos plásticos pero -según el diario El País- su pequeño tamaño dificulta que las instalaciones de reciclaje las puedan atrapar y la mayoría termina en ríos y océanos. Solo en Estados Unidos, estiman los sitios web de los Parques Nacionales del país, cada día se utilizan más de 500 millones de absorbentes. Una situación que recientemente llevó a ciudades como Washington o Seattle a prohibirlos.

Motel que compartía información con ‘La Migra’ tendría que pagar hasta $200,000 a cada afectado

Texto completo: Un juez federal se mostró dispuesto a aprobar un acuerdo preliminar presentado este viernes por el que la cadena de hospedaje Motel 6 pagará 10 millones de dólares, y que sería el punto final de una querella interpuesta tras descubrirse que se compartía información de huéspedes con ICE .
El juez David Campbell señaló a los abogados de ambas partes que una vez se entregue la documentación requerida para finales de este mes no tendría objeciones en aprobar el acuerdo preliminar, que eleva la cifra previa de 7.6 millones alcanzado entre la organización civil MALDEF y la cadena, y que la Fiscalía había considerado insuficiente.
“Este acuerdo es una gran victoria para nuestra comunidad, envía un fuerte mensaje: Motel 6 violó los derechos de cientos de personas compartiendo su información con ICE ” (Inmigración y Control de Aduanas), dijo a Efe Thomas Saenz, presidente del Fondo Mexicano Estadounidense para la Defensa Legal (MALDEF).
La compensación monetaria en esta demanda colectiva, en la que se denunció que empleados de la cadena entregaban información de los huéspedes a ICE, dependerá de si los afectados fueron cuestionados, arrestados o inclusive deportados. También si tenían hijos menores o familiares que fueron afectados por su detención.
Como parte de este nuevo acuerdo se eleva la compensación monetaria para aquellos que fueron víctimas de esta práctica, y en todos los hoteles de la cadena en Arizona y no solo unos cuantos que fueron mencionados en el primer acuerdo.
Aquellos cuyo nombre fue entregado a ICE en 2017 cuando se hospedaron en Motel 6, recibirán ahora 75 dólares, 25 dólares más que los mencionados en el acuerdo original.
La compensación no excederá los 200,000 dólares por persona .
También se modifico la cantidad que serán otorgadas de este acuerdo a organizaciones que luchan en favor de los migrantes.
Según escritos judiciales, los empleados de Motel 6 entregaban información privada a ICE de aquellos que se registraban utilizando matriculas consulares, pasaportes o identificaciones extranjeras.
Los abogados estiman que el número de víctimas se podría incrementar hasta 50,000 .
Saenz indicó que a partir de agosto comenzará un periodo de gracia donde aquellos que no estén conformes con este nuevo acuerdo podrán apelar, y quienes consideren que fueron víctimas de Motel 6 también se podrían agregar a la demanda.
Por su parte, la oficina del Fiscal del Estado de Arizona, Mark Brnovich dijo a Efe que revisaran el nuevo acuerdo.
El pasado mes de mayo, Brnovich pidió a la corte rechazar el primer acuerdo debido a que lo consideraba injusto para las víctimas, porque iban a recibir muy poco dinero.

'When They See Us' star talks Emmy nods

Texto completo: "When They See Us," Ava DuVemay's Netflix miniseries about the 1989 Central Park jogger case, is officially a strong Emmy contender after collecting 16 nominations Tuesday. Among those accolades is a nod for outstanding lead actor in a limited series or movie for Jharrel Jerome, who plays Korey Wise, one of five teenagers who was accused of raping and assaulting a woman in Central Park.
Of the five boys, Wise spent the longest time in prison - more than 13 years - before the confession of another man led to their exoneration. "When They See Us" follows the events of that night, as well as the effects the convictions and media attention had on the boys and their families.
On Tuesday afternoon, Jerome, 21, spoke about his nomination, his relationship with Wise and what the story of the Central Park Five means to him. These are edited excerpts from that conversation.
Q: The last time we spoke, the series hadn't come out yet. Did you have a sense then how much this would resonate with viewers?
A: It's what I prayed for - I wanted it for the five men. I prayed that the title would come to fruition, and that we would actually see these men for who they are by name, not by the moniker given to them, "the Central Park Five." So in terms of seeing the impact reach the world, that right there is a job done for me. Even if just one person says "Wow, I can relate, and I can feel" - it moves me. It's the biggest blessing, and it goes beyond any nomination and any award. So I'm just happy now.
Q: What has been your biggest takeaway from all the viewer reactions?
At Just that art imitates life. People can view art as their medicine and as their healing factor, so to be a part of that, that's everything to me just seeing Korey's (social media) page alone go over 300,000 followers - that blows my mind. That so many people are inspired by him and want to reach out to him, giving him the praise, the respect, the condolences he's deserved for the past 30 years.
Q: You've talked a lot about having a strong bond with Korey.
A: It's an unbreakable bond. It's still so strong, and even if we go a while without talking, we'll always come back and remind each other of new much we inspire each other, how much we love being around each other. I'm here in New York now, so hopefully I'll get to see nim before I get out of here. I'm going to give him a phone call as soon as I'm done.
Q: The series has received a ton of praise, but also criticism, particularly from some of the real-life figures - including the former prosecutor Linda Fairstein - portrayed on-screen. Have you paid any attention to the controversy?
A: No, I haven't paid much attention to it at all. This show wasn't about them at all - it's about the five men, it's about the positivity and the impact. However the world responds is how they choose to respond. It's good to know that nobody wants to let anyone go easy, and if you feel pain and hurt from a show, it's nice to know that there's people standing up for how they feel. But I haven't read a single article about it. I've just heard it through the grapevine and you know: You nod, and you wave and move on to the next reason you love doing the show.
Q: When you talk about the pain - there are a lot of people who say they haven't been able to bring themselves to watch the series because of the feelings it might bring up. How do you respond to that?
A: I understand that. I was a part of the show, I spent months doing it, I read the script, I knew what I was going to see, and I even had a hard time watching it. I had to pause it a couple times and breathe through it.
I just pray everyone does find the courage and the strength somewhere to just push through it until the end. Korey end Kevin, Raymond, Yusef and Antron - they didn't have the choice to shut the TV off. They didn't have the choice to say "No, I can't do this, I can't watch this." So hopefully, viewers feel that urge to do it for them. But if they can't, then they can't. And if they can't, hopefully that feeling of not being able to is a lesson in itself.
Q: What is the one thing you took away from this that most resonates with you?
A: I've learned that it's our job as artists to go beyond what we think is OK for a film. I think it's good to step out of the box, and tell stories that challenge the heart and the mind. Doing this show taught me, pretty much, how I want to be in my career, and that's doing important work like this.

Texto completo: Salinas residents may find their lifespans lengthened, thanks to a new initiative called the Blue Zones Project that Monterey County launched earlier this summer.
The Blue Zones Project is a health initiative backed by Salinas Valley Memorial Healthcare System, Montage Health and Taylor Farms.
The program is based on the travels of National Geographic's explorer Dan Buettner, who identified communities worldwide where people share lifestyle traits and live 100 or years. He wrote a New York Times best-seller about the nine principles of longevity.
The "Power Nine" include moving naturally by being physically active, eating a plant-focused diet, knowing your purpose in life, taking time to relax, having a healthy social network and putting loved ones first. A popular activity is to form walking groups at worksites, which gets people active and engaging with one another.
The philosophy is that making policy and practical changes at businesses, government offices, schools, restaurants and elsewhere that promote healthier choices in daily life will become habit.
Through these principles, Monterey County leaders hope to improve the lives of residents. Sites around the U.S. that participate in the Blue Zones project have seen different effects depending on what they focused on. Some saw a more engaged community or an increase in average lifespan while others experienced drops in childhood obesity.
How do I participate in the Blue Zones Project? Blue Zones asks residents to take a pledge and commit to specific actions they can take to improve their lives and increase their lifespan, such as adopting a dog, gardening or attending a faith-based organization.
Next year, children all over the county will be sent home with one of these pledge forms. "Children are our greatest communicators," said Monterey County Superintendent of Schools Deneen Guss. The county's youngest residents are key to involving adults, she said, after they talk the information over with their parents and guardians at home.
Executive Director of Blue Zones Project Monterey County Tiffany Ditullio added that "walking school buses," or walking groups that took a regular route to school, with chaperones guiding kids to their destination, were a large part of creating buy-in from parents.
"The idea is that you create an environment that's engaging to the parents and safe (for the kids)," said Ditullio. "The parents participate (as chaperones), even."
Furthermore, Guss said, walking school buses could help to alleviate environmental stressors created by school traffic.
"It's a double win," Guss said. "If you have less cars jamming into a school parking lot and you get more kids to bike, walk and skate to school in a healthy way, everyone wins."
To that end, the City of Salinas is looking into making itself more pedestrian-friendly, Ditullio said.
She pointed out the Alisal vibrancy plan and the street connectivity plans put forth by the city. Furthermore, CalTrans and other transit organizations are involved in ensuring public transit is closing the gaps for walkers.
"I've driven all over Salinas. All over," said Ditullio. "But now, when I drive by the food bank, for example, a beautiful building, I think, 'How do people get here?' Is there public transportation? Is there a sidewalk?"
Former President and CEO of NCH Healthcare System of Naples, Fla., Dr. Allen Weiss implemented the Blue Zones Project at NCH in 2015. In that time, he said, the life expectancy for residents of Naples increased by two-tenths of a year (10 weeks) while the average lifespan in the U.S. declined by one-tenth of a year (5 weeks).
In another Blue Zones community, Beach Cities, the rate of childhood obesity dropped by 64%, said Terri Merritt-Worden, vice president of Operations for Blue Zones Project, .
Dealing with diverse populations has its challenges, though. A one-size-fits-all model cannot be applied.
In Fort Worth, Texas, local Blue Zones Director of Community Engagement Ricky Cotto said the engagement and health of the African-American and Latino communities increased, but only after Project workers learned how to accommodate their residents by providing childcare at meetings or including bilingual materials.
The Blue Zones Project kickoff will be held June 29 at 1 p.m. at Sherwood Hall in Salinas, and will last until 4:30 p.m. This is a free community event; all are welcome to attend.

Drogas: el nuevo atractivo “turístico” de la tolerante Nueva York que tiene las calles en jaque

Texto completo: Unas 600 mil personas cruzan a diario por la central de trenes Penn Station, en pleno Midtown de la ciudad de Nueva York.
Meca del turismo por diversas razones, Manhattan se ha convertido cada vez más en un destino para adictos a opioides y otras drogas , venidos desde diversas partes del país. Son visitantes sin planes de marcharse.
Nueva York tiene su propia crisis de adictos locales: las muertes por sobredosis aumentaron considerablemente en 2016 con la llegada del fentanilo, y las autoridades dicen que la ciudad se ha convertido en un centro para el opioide sintético ilegal. Pero aparte de El Bronx y Staten Island, la crisis tendía a ocultarse en gran medida de la vista del público, especialmente en Midtown.
Ya no es así en Penn Station, el terminal de autobuses de la Autoridad Portuaria, ambos en Midtown West; Jamaica Station en Queens y otros centros de tránsito masivo. Allí, los adictos buscan droga, piden dinero e incluso duermen en campamentos improvisados. Sus números aumentan a medida que el clima se vuelve más cálido, y su presencia recuerda una época más dura que se pensaba superada en Nueva York.
“Son refugiados drogadictos”, dijo a New York Times Dimitri Mugianis, consejero de NYHRE, organización sin fines de lucro que trabaja con adictos y sus familias para promover el uso seguro de drogas.
Mugianis dijo que los usuarios de opioides vienen a Nueva York en busca de drogas , pero también porque pueden encontrar más tolerancia y apoyo aquí que en sus lugares de origen, y un mayor acceso a servicios como clínicas y el intercambio de jeringas.
Los funcionarios de la ciudad dijeron que esta población es transitoria y no representa un aumento general en las filas de las personas sin hogar. Aún así, su creciente presencia es difícil de ignorar.
Barbara A. Blair, presidente de Garment District Alliance, que representa a empresas y dueños de propiedades en el área entre Penn Station y la Autoridad Portuaria, conocida como el “Distrito de la Moda”, dijo que a partir del verano pasado llegaron muchas más personas que parecían estar consumiendo drogas.
“Regresaron este año”, dijo Blair. “Están allí con sus carteles de cartón. Están desmayados”.
El Departamento de Policía de Nueva York, cuyo Buró de Tránsito patrulla el sistema de Metro, dijo que los arrestos por delitos relacionados con drogas aumentaron 55% hasta junio en las estaciones conectadas a Penn Station, Port Authority y Jamaica en Queens, en comparación con el mismo período del año pasado.
Ciertamente, la gente ha venido a Nueva York a comprar drogas durante décadas. Pero en el pasado normalmente regresaban a casa una vez que hacían una adquisición.
Ahora se están quedando más. La primera ola llegó a la ciudad desde Long Island, Nueva Jersey y Connecticut hace unos cinco años, según varias entrevistas.
Muchos dijeron que primero se habían vuelto adictos a los opioides recetados, pero que habían progresado a las drogas callejeras y estaban luchando contra las adicciones a la heroína cuando llegaron.
Grace Cohen arribó con su novio desde un suburbio de Atlanta el otoño pasado, después de haber luchado contra la adicción a los opiáceos y terminar sin hogar. “Hay más recursos para nosotros aquí”, dijo la joven de 19 años, en la entrada del Metro en West 42nd Street.
No sólo los vecinos y empresarios se quejan. Varias personas que han vivido en las calles de Midtown durante años dicen que ya no recogen suficiente dinero debido al aumento de la competencia de estos recién llegados.
Yolanda Rodríguez (30), residente de El Bronx, ha pasado varios años mendigando en West 40th Street, luchando contra enfermedades mentales y el uso de sustancias. La razón del crecimiento de la población, dijo, es obvia. “Drogas… Mira alrededor. Están por todas partes”.
People struggling with addiction have been appearing in greater numbers near New York City’s transit hubs https://t.co/9fajRkPTEa

Both parties are misbehaving in line with their historic character

Texto completo: The air is thick with lamentations that our two political parties are tearing themselves (and the nation) to pieces. The Republican president has picked a Twitter fight on with four Democratic freshman congresswomen and the Democratic speaker of the U.S. House has chosen to violate House rules to pick a fight with the president.
All this has been treated as unprecedented: Donald Trump’s conduct by Democrats and legacy media, Nancy Pelosi’s by Republicans and Trump supporters. That’s true in a trivial sense. Twitter didn’t exist before 2006; only seven current House members, not including Pelosi, were serving the last time a House speaker (Tip O’Neill) was called out (by Newt Gingrich) for violating House rules, in May 1984.
But actually, there’s precedent aplenty. Both parties are behaving in line with their historic character, apparent since they were founded amid swirling political controversies: the Democrats in 1832, the Republicans in 1854.
The Republican Party was formed to oppose the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which allowed slavery in the territories. It immediately attracted a core constituency tilted toward New England Yankees and their descendants across the Midwest. Ever since, it has been centered on one core constituency of people who are regarded by themselves and others as typical Americans, but who by themselves are not a majority of the nation.
The Democratic Party was formed to oppose the Second Bank of the United States and to support Andrew Jackson, who won his second term with big majorities from Southwestern frontiersmen and workers in burgeoning cities in New York and Pennsylvania. Ever since, it has been a coalition of divergent constituencies, capable of winning robust national majorities in favorable times, but fractiously fissiparous in others.
Today, the parties are behaving according to form. Voters identifying as Republicans express almost unanimous support of a president who won less than half the votes cast in 2016 primaries. That’s better than Ronald Reagan or the George Bushes typically did. This despite the fact Trump has broken sharply from those Republican presidents’ trade and immigration policies and decries the war in Iraq.
On the surface, Democrats may seem united too. House Democrats voted unanimously to violate House rules and pass a resolution denouncing Trump for a “racist” tweet. But however genuine their rage, this was obviously a diversionary tactic to cover up loud dissension in the ranks. In response to Pelosi’s dismissal of “the Squad” (the four first-termers Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley, and Rashida Tlaib) as just four votes, their defenders have taken to accusing Pelosi of racism.
These incessant allegations of racism should strike Americans as absurd. There is less racism today than at any time in the history of a nation that twice cast majorities of its votes for an African-American president. Trump’s tweet was, as Fox News’ Brit Hume commented, “nativist, xenophobic, counterfactual and politically stupid,” but doesn’t “meet the definition of racist, a word so recklessly flung around these days that its actual meaning is being lost.”
It’s long since been lost for many reporters, who delight in headlining the latest Squad antics. Pelosi obviously fears that this isn’t helpful if Democrats want to retain the House seats that gave them their majority: upscale districts whose white college graduate voters are repelled by Trump but aren’t eager for Ocasio-Cortez's proposed abolition of airline travel or for the 70% tax rate that Bernie Sanders has praised.
Nevertheless, Democratic presidential candidates seem to disagree with Pelosi’s analysis. They have embraced, to the dismay of the New York Times’ Thomas Friedman, the abolition of private health insurance, free health care for illegal immigrants, and the decriminalization of illegal border crossing.
In addition, they’re promising free college, forgiveness of college debt, and ninth-month abortions — including, as Julián Castro reminded anyone who was wondering, “for someone in the trans community — a trans-female.”
These candidates fear attacks from one of the many constituency groups in the Democratic coalition, or, to put it more precisely, from their self-appointed Twitter representatives. Attacks from even one constituency (blacks, Latinos, gays, lesbians, transgenders, feminists, greens: the list goes on and on) might torpedo their attempts to climb into the first or second tier (or, for Joe Biden, his attempt to keep others out of them).
For many in the media, the Squad’s and the groups’ issue positions sound nifty, and even their recent refusals to denounce Antifa violence seem understandable. But will they prove attractive to the suburbanites Pelosi worries about, or to blue-collar ancestral Democrats uncertain about voting again for Trump? It's likely they won't.Story URLPhoto Caption:President Trump and Nancy Pelosi are seen.

Think Sweden is a good example for health care? Think again

Autor: Evensen, Jay.

Texto completo: I was watching the evening news two weeks ago with my wife’s 86-year-old uncle when he suddenly began having seizures.
I’m not normally prone to panic, but this was no normal medical crisis for me. My wife’s uncle, his television and his living room all reside in Sweden, in a town called Eskilstuna, population 67,359, according to 2015 figures. I was there on vacation with my family.
I was about to come face-to-face with Sweden’s vaunted health care system. To my surprise, it was not a pleasant experience.
I need to preface this by saying I am fluent in the Swedish language. I served a two-year mission there for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, married a woman who, although raised in the U.S., was born in Sweden and also speaks the language, have freelanced for a Swedish newspaper, been interviewed by Swedish radio and visited the country many times. So my experiences are not the result of anything being lost in translation.
Sweden’s health care system is important to the discussion in this country, prevalent among some Democratic presidential candidates, about whether the United States should adopt a single-payer, universal health care system.
Sweden often comes up as an example of why this would be better than what we currently have. My experience offers some context.
In many ways, it’s not fair to use Sweden as an example because, for much of the time that it has offered universal care, it has been a mostly homogenous nation. However, the results of its socialized care system truly have been impressive. Statistics from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development show Sweden has among the best cancer and heart attack survival rates in Europe. Life expectancy, at 82.2 years, is higher than the European average and well above the 78.7 years in the U.S.
But now, because of an influx in immigrants and refugees, and an aging population, the system is facing a crisis. It isn’t keeping up with demand, despite Swedes spending 11 percent of GDP on health care, the third highest amount in Europe and rising. The Lancet recently reported that Sweden’s population has grown by 13 percent over the last 20 years, but that its number of hospital beds has declined by 30 percent, representing the worst shortage in Europe. Health care is a constant issue of concern in elections.
Two years ago, in one northern city of 20,000 people, the government shut down the only maternity ward. Women there now have to drive 124 miles for services. The Business Times said midwives in this town are teaching couples how to give birth in cars.
The New York Times recently reported on the impact waves of refugees are having in Sweden, many of whom come with major health problems. “Complaints about delays in the health care system have become legion, with wealthier people resorting to private insurance,” the paper said.
I wasn’t thinking of any of this as I dialed 112 (Sweden’s equivalent of 911) and spoke to a dispatcher. I was, however, concerned that the dispatcher had to ask which city I was in, then transfer me to a local number that rang three times before someone picked up. I was even more concerned when that person asked for my address, something immediately available to emergency dispatchers here.
It took 15 minutes for an ambulance to come. I later was told we were lucky. My mother-in-law had fallen and cut herself during a recent visit to the same home, and the 112 dispatcher said it would be at least an hour before someone could arrive.
Our emergency happened on a Friday night. After several hours in the emergency room, we were told my wife’s uncle would have to be admitted and kept at least until Monday. Why? Because the doctor he needed does not work weekends.
This story has a good ending. My wife’s uncle was sent home last week and was doing well. He will have multiple visits each day from nurses who will feed him, give him medicine, get him in and out of bed and make sure he is OK. All of this will cost him a pittance out-of-pocket (and everyone else there plenty in taxes). But I couldn’t help wondering how long it would be until that service is curtailed, as well.
The U.S., much bigger and more complex, has a long history of rapid growth and immigration. These are not bad things, but would a single-payer plan be the best way to handle the health demands they produce?
Bernie Sanders recently said his universal health care plan would cost between $30 trillion and $40 trillion over 10 years. Before anyone uses Sweden as an example of why this would work, they ought to look at Sweden as an example of why it probably wouldn’t.

Texto completo: The Apollo 11 moon walk wasn’t the first broadcast sent from space, but in geographic reach, it was the most astonishing. Microwave links, satellites and landlines carried images of Neil Armstrong’s steps around the globe from Australia and the United States to Japan and Europe, even parts of the Eastern Bloc, in virtually real time. This was live TV from more than 200,000 miles away, using the technology of 1969.
Although the experience of watching that event looms large in memory for those who saw it, for NASA historians and other space experts, the preservation of that broadcast has provided its own drama.
On Saturday, the moon landing’s 50th anniversary, three reels of videotape will be auctioned at Sotheby’s, marketed as “the only surviving first-generation recordings of the historic moon walk” and “the earliest, sharpest, and most accurate surviving video images of man’s first steps on the moon.”
According to Sotheby’s, a NASA intern named Gary George bought the recordings as part of a collection of 1,150 reels at a government surplus auction in 1976. He paid $217.77 for them. The bidding Saturday starts at $700,000, and Sotheby’s estimates they will sell for over $1 million.
How those three reels came to be seen as a precious historical artifact speaks to the elaborate techniques used to bring the moon landing to the public. The story also involves government missteps that destroyed other recordings that could have rivaled George’s for the claim of being first.
Because the lunar module was limited in the bandwidth it could send back to Earth - bandwidth that would also have to carry voice communications and medical information from the astronauts - Westinghouse designed a special camera that recorded imagery at a low frame rate, 10 frames per second. Those images were transmitted to three tracking stations on Earth, two in Australia and one in California. There, they were recorded to telemetry tapes (also called the slow-scan tapes or instrumentation tapes). These were the purest taped records of what the camera captured on the moon.
But that’s not what viewers saw on TV. The standard broadcast rate in the United States was 30 frames per second, not 10.
And in 1969, the conversion “effectively involved pointing a television camera at a screen that could display that nonstandard signal,” said Stephen Slater, a space program historian and archival specialist.
By the time that converted imagery reached living-room TVs - after microwave and satellite hops across the globe and routing through Houston - “it was really ghostly,” he said. “It was really substandard quality compared to the image that the camera actually recorded.”
The slow-scan tapes were considered the first and clearest recordings of the moon landing. “That was where TV was recorded raw as it came from the moon,” said Richard Nafzger, a retired NASA engineer who coordinated television operations from Apollo 7 through Apollo 17.
But those tapes have likely been lost forever.
In the 2000s, NASA led a search for them and concluded they had almost certainly been reused or erased during a tape shortage at NASA in the early 1980s.
Videotape recordings of the broadcast that NASA kept in Houston didn’t fare much better. “During the energy shortage during the Carter administration, the air conditioning in nearly all government buildings was turned off at night and on weekends,” said Bill Wood, who was a lead engineer at the California tracking station and part of the search for the telemetry tapes and later for the best-quality broadcast tapes. The high humidity in the Houston area led to irreparable damage to the tapes, he said.
These unfortunate events, in effect, let George’s tapes succeed to the throne of being called the earliest known remaining recording of the broadcast - by a hair.
They were made at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center, now Johnson Space Center, in Houston, where a technician would select the best images from Australia and California to create a feed (which Slater described as “NASA TV”) that went out to the world.
George’s tapes are a recording of the same feed everyone else saw. But people watching Armstrong’s giant leap for mankind at home were viewing a feed relayed through microwaves, coaxial cables and satellites from Houston to television networks, with the images suffering a little degradation on every leg.
The images on George’s tapes never left Houston.
“It’s definitely going to be better,” said Paul Vanezis, a documentary producer and director who, as a videotape assistant at the BBC in the early 1990s, played the BBC’s recordings of the raw footage.
Still, some video experts have raised questions about the terminology Sotheby’s is using in its marketing. Slater, an archive producer on the recent documentary “Apollo 11,” said there are many other “first-generation” recordings of the broadcast. That’s true, according to an accepted definition of the term. According to Vanezis, any recording directly from a signal, as opposed to another tape, would be considered “first-generation,” including tapes that were retained in the archives of the BBC, CBS and perhaps other networks.
“The BBC’s recording is a first-generation recording,” Vanezis explained. “It’s not a great recording” - Europe was the last corner of the world to receive the transmission - “but it’s still a first-generation recording.”
Cassandra Hatton, a vice president and senior specialist at Sotheby’s, said comparing the tapes on offer to other extant copies, such as the BBC’s recordings or the tapes at CBS News Archives, was “totally unnecessary,” and that the “first-generation” label still applied.
“Every other tape done afterward was done after the signal was bounced, and every time the signal was bounced, there was a degradation in the quality of the data,” she said.
Still, the subtleties of what makes these tapes unique have caused enough confusion that NASA published an article July 8 clarifying that the tapes at Sotheby’s are not the lost tapes, as some publications have inaccurately reported.
(Sotheby’s, which has a detailed history of the moon landing’s transmission and tapes on its website, does not claim they are the lost tapes.)
The provenance is another selling factor. Hatton emphasized that the tapes were made in Houston. They came to Sotheby’s in their original boxes with labels and the receipt that George received when purchasing them from the General Services Administration. The owning agency is listed as NASA Johnson Space Center.
George, now a 65-year-old retired engineer living in Las Vegas, has kept the tapes at climate-controlled storage facilities.
And now that he is getting older, he figured it was time to cash in on his surplus-sale discovery.
“Most of the people that were alive and were able to watch this originally on July 20, 1969, they are the ones that have a real appreciation for it,” he said.

Texto completo: In October, ESPN plans to launch a new daily morning podcast, an audio production expected to include news coverage, trends in sports and feature stories by ESPN's team of reporters.
"It's not going to be 'SportsCenter'; it's not news and highlights," said ESPN Vice President Norby Williamson, who is overseeing the launch of "The ESPN Daily." "It's not three people sitting around a microphone talking, either. We want this to be elevated and highly produced."
Williamson suggested episodes could examine in-depth reporting, such as Jeremy Schaap's recent look at netting at Major League Baseball stadiums, or focus on a big, breaking story, such as when Kawhi Leonard picked the Los Angeles Clippers.
"The idea would be to put that signing into context," Williamson said. "How does it affect the Clippers? How does it affect the balance of the NBA? And we have reporters - Zach Lowe, Adrian Wojnarowski, Brian Windhorst, Stan Van Gundy - who could talk about that."
Williamson's description of the show, of which he expects to produce new episodes every weekday morning that would probably run between 18 and 25 minutes, has many elements of "The Daily," a popular podcast by the New York Times that focuses on the news of the day.
"The ESPN Daily" will represent the latest expansion by the network into podcasting. Don Van Natta Jr. is working on a docuseries and podcast, the documentary series "30 for 30" launched an audio version, and other ESPN journalists have podcasts.
It is also an effort to reach a younger audience in a growing medium. Forty-five percent of podcast listeners are between the ages of 18 and 34, according to Edison Research. Podcast ad revenue was $169 million in 2016 but is expected to reach $659 million in 2020, according to the Interactive Advertising Bureau and PricewaterhouseCoopers.

Retired Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens dead at 99

Texto completo: Justice John Paul Stevens, whose evolving judicial opinions eventually solidified him as a staunch liberal during his more than three decades on the Supreme Court, has died at the age of 99.
Stevens died Tuesday evening at a hospital in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, of complications from a stroke he suffered Monday, the Supreme Court said in a statement.
"A son of the Midwest heartland and a veteran of World War II, Justice Stevens devoted his long life to public service, including 35 years on the Supreme Court," Chief Justice John Roberts said in a statement. "He brought to our bench an inimitable blend of kindness, humility, wisdom and independence. His unrelenting commitment to justice has left us a better nation."
Born in Chicago in 1920, Stevens served in the U.S. Navy for three years and went on to have a legal career that spanned nearly 65 years and included a practice as a successful antitrust lawyer. Stevens served for five years as a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit before being appointed by President Gerald Ford to the Supreme Court in 1975, where he sat for more than 34 years. The third-longest-serving justice in the history of the court, Stevens retired at the age of 90 and was replaced by President Barack Obama with Justice Elena Kagan.
Appointed as a registered Republican, Stevens’ opinions quickly deviated from traditional conservative legal philosophy, vehemently opposing originalist constitutional interpretation.
“To suggest that the law is static is quite wrong,” Stevens said in a 2010 interview with NPR. “The whole purpose was to form a more perfect union, not something that’s perfect when we started.”
Previously opposed to affirmative action in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, he later voted to uphold the practice in a landmark decision in 2003. His views on the First Amendment's establishment clause also swung more liberal as he struck down school prayer in Wallace v. Jaffree and dissented in Van Orden v. Perry where the display of the Ten Commandments on the grounds of the Texas State Capitol was upheld.
He took stands against flag burning, the decision in Citizens United that labeled campaign contributions by corporations and unions as speech, and the court’s decision to stop the 2000 Florida ballot recount.
Perhaps one of his most scathing dissents came in District of Columbia v. Heller. Stevens rejected the notion that the Second Amendment was meant to protect the personal right of a citizen to own firearms. In a New York Times op-ed, he later called for the repeal of the Second Amendment in light of the Parkland shooting and March for Our Lives protests.
Witnessing people taking to the streets across the country, Stevens wrote in favor of enacting legislation to ban civilian ownership of semi-automatic weapons, increasing the minimum age to buy a gun to 21, and establishing more exhaustive background checks.
He added, “But the demonstrators should seek more effective and more lasting reform. They should demand the repeal of the Second Amendment.”
Stevens was regarded by many as the chief justice of the court's liberal wing. Despite Stevens' liberal leaning, Ford continued to praise his performance on the bench. In 2005 Ford said, “He is serving his nation well, with dignity, intellect and without partisan political concerns.”
In his lengthy interview with NPR, he said the only vote he regretted was one that affirmed the usage of the death penalty.
Stevens remained engaged in politics even in retirement, asserting that Justice Brett Kavanaugh did not belong on the bench during Kavanaugh's confirmation process. Stevens initially supported Kavanaugh, but said Kavanaugh's "performance during the hearings caused me to change my mind.”
Stevens believed that he "demonstrated a potential bias involving enough potential litigants before the (high) court that he would not be able to perform his full responsibilities."
He was also the author of three books, the last of which, an autobiography entitled The Making of a Justice, Reflections on My First 94 Years, was released this year.
The Chicago native was born on April 20, 1920. Before he began his career in law, he served as an intelligence officer in the Navy during WWII. He was awarded the Bronze Star for his work in codebreaking while serving in the Pacific and later graduated from Northwestern University’s law school. He then clerked for Supreme Court Justice Wiley Rutledge.
Stevens' first wife, Elizabeth Jane, and second wife, Maryan Mulholland, preceded him in death, as did his two children, John Joseph and Kathryn. He is survived by his two daughters, Elizabeth Jane Sesemann, and Susan Roberta Mullen, nine grandchildren, and 13 great-grandchildren.Story URLPhoto Caption:Retired Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens testifies on the ever-increasing amount of money spent on elections as he appears before the Senate Rules Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, April 30, 2014.

Texto completo: Gran desconcierto y temor generó el anuncio de grandes redadas de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas ( ICE ) en 10 ciudades, a comenzar el 14 de julio, pero hasta ahora no hay reportes de capturas masivas.
Los planes de la agencia se modificaron, según The New York Times, debido a la cobertura mediática.
“Los planes para la operación se modificaron en el último minuto, después de que los informes de noticias dijeron a las comunidades de inmigrantes sobre qué esperar” , indicó el diario.
Sin embargo, un alto funcionario de inmigración confirmó a CNN que la lista de ciudades e individuos objetivo sigue siendo la misma y podría impactar al menos a 2,000 familias; agregó que la movilización comenzó el sábado y se extenderá a otras ciudades sin precisar, además de que los operativos se harían discretamente.
“No esperaría una gran movilización que coincida con la histeria que hemos escuchado en los últimos días” , dijo el funcionario.
Los operativos se programaron en Atlanta , Baltimore , Chicago , Denver , Houston , Los Ángeles , Miami , Nueva Orleans, Nueva York y San Francisco , zonas donde se concentra el mayor número de inmigrantes legales e indocumentados.
IMPORTANTE: Los 5 principales consejos para enfrentar redadas de ICE
Defensores y activistas han reportado las tácticas que ICE podría estar utilizando para lograr las capturas.
“Puedo confirmar. ICE fue a la casa de un cliente vistiendo camisas que decían ‘POLICÍA'” , indicó el abogador Aaron Reichlin-Melnick . “Le mostraron a su sobrina adolescente una foto de un hombre al azar que, según dijeron, había robado la identidad de su tío y la hizo llamarlo para que regresara a casa. Cuando llegó a casa, lo detuvieron frente a ella. Ella estaba traumatizada”.
Can confirm. ICE went a client's home wearing shirts that said "POLICE."
They showed his teenage niece a picture of a random man they said had stolen her uncle's identity and had her call him to come home.
When he got home they arrested him in front of her. She was traumatized. https://t.co/3aDtacM8pj
— Aaron Reichlin-Melnick (@ReichlinMelnick) July 15, 2019
También se destaca que los agentes migratorios podrían estar esperando a sus objetivos fuera de sus viviendas, para evitar alertarlos y lograr capturarlos.
“Los agentes de ICE deben esperar a que sus objetivos salgan de sus hogares voluntariamente para arrestarlos” , indica Daniel Nichanian, miembro de la organización The Justice Collaborative. “Usan tácticas como llevar fotos de señuelos, mostrarlas por las ventanas… simulando estar buscando a alguien más”.
Cabe destacar que ICE nunca especifica cómo, cuándo y dónde realiza sus operativos contra inmigrantes, pero sus propios reportes de diversas movilizaciones indican que movilizaciones nacionales, como el que ocurre en 10 grandes ciudades del país , pueden tardar mínimo tres días o incluso semanas.

Texto completo: Gran desconcierto y temor generó el anuncio de grandes redadas de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas ( ICE ) en 10 ciudades, a comenzar el 14 de julio, pero hasta ahora no hay reportes de capturas masivas.
Los planes de la agencia se modificaron, según The New York Times, debido a la cobertura mediática.
“Los planes para la operación se modificaron en el último minuto, después de que los informes de noticias dijeron a las comunidades de inmigrantes sobre qué esperar” , indicó el diario.
Sin embargo, un alto funcionario de inmigración confirmó a CNN que la lista de ciudades e individuos objetivo sigue siendo la misma y podría impactar al menos a 2,000 familias; agregó que la movilización comenzó el sábado y se extenderá a otras ciudades sin precisar, además de que los operativos se harían discretamente.
“No esperaría una gran movilización que coincida con la histeria que hemos escuchado en los últimos días” , dijo el funcionario.
Los operativos se programaron en Atlanta , Baltimore , Chicago , Denver , Houston , Los Ángeles , Miami , Nueva Orleans, Nueva York y San Francisco , zonas donde se concentra el mayor número de inmigrantes legales e indocumentados.
IMPORTANTE: Los 5 principales consejos para enfrentar redadas de ICE
Defensores y activistas han reportado las tácticas que ICE podría estar utilizando para lograr las capturas.
“Puedo confirmar. ICE fue a la casa de un cliente vistiendo camisas que decían ‘POLICÍA'” , indicó el abogador Aaron Reichlin-Melnick . “Le mostraron a su sobrina adolescente una foto de un hombre al azar que, según dijeron, había robado la identidad de su tío y la hizo llamarlo para que regresara a casa. Cuando llegó a casa, lo detuvieron frente a ella. Ella estaba traumatizada”.
Can confirm. ICE went a client's home wearing shirts that said "POLICE."
They showed his teenage niece a picture of a random man they said had stolen her uncle's identity and had her call him to come home.
When he got home they arrested him in front of her. She was traumatized. https://t.co/3aDtacM8pj

También se destaca que los agentes migratorios podrían estar esperando a sus objetivos fuera de sus viviendas, para evitar alertarlos y lograr capturarlos.
“Los agentes de ICE deben esperar a que sus objetivos salgan de sus hogares voluntariamente para arrestarlos” , indica Daniel Nichanian, miembro de la organización The Justice Collaborative. “Usan tácticas como llevar fotos de señuelos, mostrarlas por las ventanas… simulando estar buscando a alguien más”.
Cabe destacar que ICE nunca especifica cómo, cuándo y dónde realiza sus operativos contra inmigrantes, pero sus propios reportes de diversas movilizaciones indican que movilizaciones nacionales, como el que ocurre en 10 grandes ciudades del país , pueden tardar mínimo tres días o incluso semanas.

Texto completo: If we learned anything lately it is that the Democratic Party is an absolute mess. Fault lines are deeper than ever between the young socialists and the old establishment figures who run the place.
Let's start with the Democratic primary for president, where Kamala Harris took us on a head-spinning journey that began with her flogging of former Vice President Joe Biden. At the first primary debate, Harris assailed Biden for opposing federally mandated busing, an extremely unpopular policy among people of all races and political parties. Debate viewers were left to believe that Harris – who emotionally attributed busing to her getting a quality education – supported the federal mandates.
A few days later, however, Harris backed away from federal mandates and instead took much the same position as Biden – that states and school districts should make decisions.
This flip was on top of her Medicare for All flop, wherein she said on the stage that she would eliminate all private insurance and then the next day said she wouldn't. Harris appears to get caught up in moments; she tells liberal debate audiences what they want to hear before her advisers swoop in with polling data that shows the political reality of her positions. This is a dangerous trait in a president; the office frequently demands its occupants to make decisions that run afoul of popular passions.
Harris is the flavor of the month for the Woke Folk, but she is proving to be anything but steady in her policy positions.
Her attack on Biden was not rooted in principle but rather in showing that she can rhetorically bludgeon an old white male in front of a camera and not think twice about it. It was performance art in our regrettably post-policy political environment.
The prospect of nominating an old white male for president continues to deeply divide the Democratic Party, and the Woke Folk (at least the ones not supporting Bernie Sanders) are desperate for someone – anyone – to destroy America's elderly political patriarchy. Policy, principle, and experience are irrelevant; race, gender or sexual orientation are the only credentials required to satisfy the angry mob, and Harris knows it. She whacked Biden so that Democrats could visualize her doing the same to Trump.
As Harris hammers away at Grandpa Joe, her Woke cohorts in the House Democratic Conference are similarly raging against Nanna Nancy Pelosi. The House speaker gave an interview to the New York Times (who else would she whine to after getting owned by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in the showdown over the border supplemental?) in which she cast serious shade on Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and three other freshmen Democratic women who criticized her for acquiescing to the Senate border funding bill.
"All these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world," Pelosi said. "But they didn't have any following. They're four people, and that's how many votes they got."
Insulting AOC's "Twitter world" is to the Woke Folk what a good "yo mama" joke was to my friends on the school playground. Predictably, AOC punched right back at Pelosi, calling the speaker's legislative moves "a huge mistake."
We are a long way from February's Rolling Stone cover showing Pelosi and the Ocasio-Cortez gang smiling for a story about "women shaping the future." House Democrats have desperately tried to present a united front among the old guard leadership and the young radicals, but the charade came to a crashing end with Pelosi swatting them away like irrelevant but annoying gnats.
The divisions could deepen this week if billionaire impeachment activist Tom Steyer pulls the trigger on a presidential campaign. He has spent heavily of his own fortune on advertising and a petition drive to push impeachment proceedings, still an animating issue for young House Democrats and the liberal activists who support them. Steyer's launch will reinsert impeachment as a core issue in the primary as polls shows it to be a political loser for Democrats among the broader electorate.
As Democrats push their presidential candidates further to the left, the American economy continues to bounce and cracks emerge in Pelosi's makeshift socialist dam, Trump's chances for reelection are getting better every day.

Mark Murphy column: The sordid saga of Jeffrey Epstein

Texto completo: The "12-year-old case" Acosta was referring to was a 2008 plea bargain deal with shadowy financier Jeffrey Epstein, a case which Acosta handled as the lead negotiator in his prior role as the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida. The deal Acosta referred to so dismissively was one which required Epstein to register as a sex offender, pay restitution to the victims of his crimes and serve 18 months in a county jail - although he was allowed to leave that jail six days a week, for up to 12 hours a day, to go to work. He also was required to be on house arrest for a year after his jail term. The terms of the deal also stipulated that his victims were not to be notified of the deal before it was closed and that any and all grand jury investigations in the matter would cease. Notably, Epstein pleaded guilty to a lesser state offense of soliciting prostitution and avoided any federal charges - this despite a 53-page federal indictment of Epstein, based upon evidence from 36 recognized victims, which had been prepared by the Department of Justice prior to the plea deal.
Epstein was ultimately released from jail five months early, having served 13 months. During his subsequent "house arrest" term, he took numerous trips to New York and to his home in the U.S. Virgin Islands, in direct violation of the terms of his house arrest stipulations.
The Epstein case has come back into the open largely due to some intrepid investigative journalism by the Miami Herald. The Herald published a story in November 2018 about how Epstein, through the efforts of his all-star legal team, escaped what should have been a life prison sentence in 2008 with the Acosta-negotiated legal equivalent of a slap on the wrist. In February 2019, U.S. District Judge Kenneth Marra in Florida ruled that the secret Epstein deal violated the victim's rights, saying that Epstein's victims should have been consulted prior to the deal being closed under the terms of the 1990 federal Victim's Rights Act. The New York Times subsequently published an editorial on March 1demanding that Acosta resign. The case broke open nationally after federal prosecutors in New York indicted Epstein on sex trafficking charges on July 8. Epstein pleaded not guilty.
Acosta initially refused to resign his post as Labor secretary and defended the 2008 Epstein plea bargain, saying that it was the best one he could get under the circumstances. What those "circumstances" were, exactly, is unclear.
So what are the current charges against Epstein? The July 2019 New York sex trafficking indictment alleges that between 2002 and 2005, Epstein recruited at least 80, and likely more, young women as young as 14 to perform sex acts with him, subsequently paying them hundreds of dollars. He also used those girls to recruit other young women, often from poor families or broken homes, to serve him in a similar capacity. A pending lawsuit in New York accuses Epstein of using a now-defunct modeling agency to import girls as young as 13 from Europe and South America - charges which were being investigated by the Department of Justice at the time of Epstein's initial plea bargain, but dropped as a consequence of Acosta's deal. He is alleged to have loaned young women to friends and associates for sexual favors and to have hosted sex parties at his ranch in New Mexico and his private island in the Caribbean. The Miami Herald article uncovered evidence regarding 80 former Epstein victims and located 60 of them. Eight agreed to be interviewed by the newspaper. What they revealed is a shocking pattern of abuse by a sexual predator who used his power and wealth to abuse, and traffic in, vulnerable young women - and who essentially got away with it, at least until now.
Epstein's is yet another example of how people with the means to do so can manipulate the legal system to avoid responsibility for their crimes. And now, thanks to the hard work done by the Miami Herald - and despite the cowardice of Alex Acosta - it looks as though registered sex offender Jeffery Epstein will finally see his day in court.
It's been a long time coming.

La estrategia racial de Trump del “ellos contra nosotros” está más viva que nunca

Texto completo: El domingo, el presidente Donald J. Trump conminó a congresistas demócratas progresistas a regresar “a los países infestados de crimen de donde vinieron”. Aunque Trump no las nombra, se refería a las cuatro congresistas electas en los comicios intermedios de 2018: Alexandria Ocasio Cortés, nacida en Nueva York y de ascendencia puertorriqueña; Ayana Pressley, de Massachusetts; Ilhan Omar, de Minnesota; y Rashida Tlaib, de Michigan. Solo Omar es inmigrante y llegó aquí como refugiada de Somalia a los 10 años de edad. Es ciudadana estadounidense.
Es obvio que para Trump ser estadounidense equivale a ser blanco. Y es esa premisa la que mueve su estrategia de campaña, ahora de reelección, así como su estrategia política y sus decisiones de política pública, especialmente en materia migratoria. De hecho, Trump lleva semanas anunciando el inicio de redadas en varias ciudades del país para detener a inmigrantes con órdenes finales de deportación, acción que para Trump es un capítulo más del reality show que es su presidencia, para infligir terror entre la comunidad inmigrante y demostrar ante sus seguidores que está cumpliéndoles lo prometido. De hecho, para garantizarles que su plan de promover división guiará su campaña de reelección.
No hay que olvidar que fue Trump quien encabezó la campaña que cuestionó la ciudadanía estadounidense del expresidente Barack Obama afirmando que había nacido en Kenia, como su padre, y no en Hawaii.
Trump no dudó en atacar a un senador federal, luego candidato y luego presidente estadounidense, abogado constitucionalista egresado de Harvard y nacido en Hawaii de madre estadounidense y padre africano. El domingo afirmó que las congresistas demócratas progresistas deben “regresar” a los países de “donde vinieron”, aunque ese país sea Estados Unidos. “Regrésate a tu país” es la frase preferida de los prejuiciosos, y muchos hemos sido el objetivo, sobre todo al hablar español en público, aunque seamos ciudadanos estadounidenses. ¿Qué pueden esperar entonces los inmigrantes al interior del país y los migrantes que arriban a la frontera o que ya están detenidos y hacinados en condiciones infrahumanas?
Si su gobierno ni siquiera tiene compasión con niños y bebés migrantes detenidos en insalubres condiciones documentadas por el Inspector General del propio Departamento de Seguridad Interna (DHS), ¿hay quien todavía ponga en duda que el único objetivo de Trump es explotar políticamente la divisiva estrategia de “ellos contra nosotros” cimentada en el nativismo, el prejuicio y el racismo?
Y claro está, sus cómplices le siguen el juego. Solo hay que remitirse a la visita del vicepresidente Mike Pence a la frontera el pasado viernes. Mientras las cámaras de la prensa que cubre al vicepresidente mostraron las terribles condiciones de hacinamiento e insalubridad y los propios reporteros indicaron que la pestilencia era abrumadora y que incluso algunos agentes portaban máscaras debido al mal olor, Pence trató de minimizar las condiciones y, claro está, culpó a los demócratas por la falta de fondos para abordar la crisis. Incluso tachó de “deshonesto” un video de CNN del hacinamiento.
Solo había que ver el rostro de Pence al observar a los migrantes enjaulados. Parecía que quería salir corriendo. Pero tenía que completar la visita para hacer creer que hay compasión, cuando en realidad Trump está utilizando la crisis humanitaria con fines electorales. La imagen de rostros morenos hacinados le sirve a Trump en sus planes de promover miedo y prejuicio entre sus huestes.
Que Trump lo haga, a nadie sorprende, pero la hipocresía del evangélico Pence es indignante aunque no sorprendente. La prensa reportó que Pence también visitó un centro de detención de niños migrantes acompañado de su esposa y de tres senadores republicanos, Lindsey Graham, de Carolina del Sur; Mike Lee, de Utah, y John Cornyn, de Texas.
The New York Times reportó que Lee le sirvió de intérprete a Pence, quien les preguntó si tenían comida y cuidados, a lo que los niños respondieron que sí. “Pero cuando les preguntó si tenían un lugar para asearse”, los niños movieron la cabeza en señal de no, según el diario.
“Dos niños le dijeron al Señor Pence que habían caminado por dos o tres meses para llegar a Estados Unidos, a lo que Pence respondió en inglés ‘God bless you’, y ‘gracias’ en español”, reportó The New York Times.
Me pregunto dónde Pence esconde su Biblia y los preceptos religiosos que tanto defiende, cuando le hace el trabajo sucio a Trump. Pence cumplió su cometido y dio la espalda al problema.
Pero el daño infligido, sobre todo el daño psicológico a los niños, ya está hecho.
Porque si algo ha demostrado Trump y su gobierno es que la crueldad y el prejuicio no tienen límites, así se trate de niños, o de expresidentes, o de congresistas que no llenen el molde racial que el presidente defiende. La estrategia electoral del “ellos (los de color) contra nosotros (los blancos)”, sigue vivita y coleando en los planes de reelección de Trump.

Dems call Trump's 'go back' tweets racist

Texto completo: President Donald Trump's opponents accused him of xenophobia and racism Sunday after he posted tweets calling on an unspecified group of Democratic congresswomen to "go back and help fix" the countries he said they "originally came" from before trying to make legislative changes in the USA.
"So interesting to see 'Progressive' Democrat Congresswomen, who originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe, the worst, most corrupt and inept anywhere in the world (if they even have a functioning government at all), now loudly and viciously telling the people of the United States, the greatest and most powerful Nation on earth, how our government is to be run.
"Why don't they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came. Then come back and show us how it is done. These places need your help badly, you can't leave fast enough. I'm sure that Nancy Pelosi would be very happy to quickly work out free travel arrangements!" the president said in three connected tweets.
Four liberal freshman congresswomen known as "the Squad" – Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley and Rashida Tlaib – presumed Trump's tweets were directed at them. Three of them were born in the USA; Omar came as a refugee from Somalia more than 20 years ago and has been an American citizen since 2000.
"Mr. President, As Members of Congress, the only country we swear an oath to is the United States. Which is why we are fighting to protect it from the worst, most corrupt and inept president we have ever seen," Omar replied.
"Mr. President, the country I 'come from' & the country we all swear to, is the United States. But given how you've destroyed our border with inhumane camps, all at a benefit to you & the corps who profit off them, you are absolutely right about the corruption laid at your feet," Ocasio-Cortez said.
"Yo @realDonaldTrump, I am fighting corruption in OUR country," Tlaib said in a tweet. "I do it every day when I hold your admin accountable as a U.S. Congresswoman. Keep talking, you'll be out of the WH soon."
"THIS is what racism looks like. WE are what democracy looks like," Pressley said.
The four House members have recently had public squabbles with Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., for her support for a bill funding border security measures and comments she made about their disagreements in a New York Times interview.
Ocasio-Cortez, Omar, Tlaib and Pressley have been frequent targets by conservative media figures.
Since taking office in January, Omar has sparked anger with her rhetoric criticizing the Trump administration and U.S. foreign policy – both past and present. Her remarks about Israel and the influence of the pro-Israeli lobby were condemned as anti-Semitic by both Republicans and Democrats.
Pelosi said Sunday that she rejects Trump's "xenophobic comments meant to divide our nation" and said they reaffirm that "his plan to 'Make America Great Again' has always been about making America white again."
"Our diversity is our strength, and our unity is our power," she said.
"Let's be clear about what this vile comment is: A racist and xenophobic attack on Democratic congresswomen," tweeted Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., one of two dozen Democrats running to unseat Trump in 2020.
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, another presidential hopeful, said in an interview on CNN's "State of the Union" that "unfortunately, there is an American tradition of telling people to go back where they came from. But you don't expect to hear it from the president of the United States."

Texto completo: For four years, the United Arab Emirates have been the military linchpin of the Saudi-led war in Yemen, providing weapons, money and thousands of ground troops to a campaign to drive out Yemen's Houthi rebels. Emirati forces led almost every major advance the coalition made.
Now they have decided they can go no further.
The Emiratis are withdrawing their forces at a scale and speed that all but rules out further ground advances, a belated recognition that a grinding war that has killed thousands of civilians and turned Yemen into a humanitarian disaster is no longer winnable.
Emirati officials have been saying for several weeks that they have begun a phased and partial withdrawal of forces estimated at 5,000 troops a fewyears ago.
But Western and Arab diplomats briefed on the drawdown say that a significant reduction has already occurred and that the Emiratis are driven mostly by their desire to exit a war whose cost has become too high, even if it means angering their Saudi allies.
In the past month, the Emiratis have cut their deployment around Hodeida, the Red Sea port that was the war's main battleground last year, by 80% to fewer than 150 men, according to four people briefed on the drawdown. They have pulled out their attack helicopters and heavy guns, effectively precluding a military advance on the city.
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates intervened in Yemen in 2015 to roll back an attempted takeover by the Houthis, a faction supported by Iran, and to restore Yemen's fragile, internationally recognized government. The war, the signature initiative of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and backed by the United States, would be over in a matter of months, they said.
Four years later, the war has failed to oust the Houthis and turned Yemen into what the United Nations has called the world's worst humanitarian crisis.
The drawdown "is going to expose the Saudis to the reality that this war is a failure," said Michael Stephens of the Royal United Services Institute, a research group in London. "It tells us the two main protagonists on the coalition side, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, don't have the same idea of what success looks like."

Texto completo: Jose Rodriguez stocked his food cart with fewer fresh fruit cups Sunday, figuring many in Santa Ana’s Latino community might stay home for fear of much-touted immigration raids.
But his sales were brisk.
Immigration arrests were not.
“I wasn’t expecting any crowds,” said Rodriguez, who has worked his cart at the same corner for 26 years, selling fresh fruits, cold drinks and Mexican treats. “There’s been so much fear in the community.”
That fear, for a day at least, seemed to be unfounded.
Immigration rights advocates from around the region said Sunday they hadn’t heard of any large operations by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE. And while some arrests occurred in Los Angeles, Riverside and Lake Elsinore over the past few days, it’s unclear if those were related to the announced sweeps or part of typical ICE work.
President Trump this month announced, initially on Twitter, that on Sunday, July 14, ICE agents would pick up some 2,000 immigrants around the country who are living in the United States illegally and have deportation orders.
He’d made a similar claim in June, saying “millions” of people would be removed from the country. The June raids never happened.
The plan slated for Sunday would focus on criminals and recent arrivals from Central America. They could also include “collateral” arrests of people who happen to be in the area of the intended targets, according to news reports.
The publicized sweeps were supposed to take place in Los Angeles, Atlanta, Baltimore, Chicago, Denver, Miami, New York and San Francisco. Two other cities originally on the list, Houston and New Orleans, were reportedly postponed because of tropical storm Barry.
It’s possible the raids were only delayed, not abandoned.
Instead of a large, simultaneous sweep, immigration officials created a secondary plan for a smaller and more diffuse scale of apprehensions to roll out over roughly a week, the New York Times reported Sunday. Individual ICE field offices were given the discretion to decide when to begin those sweeps.
Immigration officials have declined to say what their plans are, saying it could threaten the safety of agents and jeopardize their operation.
In Southern California, immigration arrests, they pointed out, are made every day.
“This is what we are. We are a law enforcement agency,” Lori Haley, an ICE spokeswoman based in Orange County, said Friday.
Many immigrant-rights advocates said they were not surprised by the low-key rollout of the so-called sweeps.
“I think they’ll do their usual ops today. They want that element of surprise,” said Jennaya Dunlap, deportation defense coordinator for the Inland Coalition for Immigrant Justice.
Even through 2,000 arrests or so – spread across Los Angeles and the other cities – are not necessarily unusual for ICE raids, the president’s words and the media’s coverage of his plan have created considerable anxiety, advocates said.
“It’s not about the numbers. It’s about the fear,” said Guillermo Torres, who spearheads the immigration campaigns of the Los Angeles-based Clergy & Laity United for Economic Justice.
“Words are powerful and they impact families. And that’s what this president has done, for political purposes, because he’s running for re-election,” Torres said.
In downtown Santa Ana, the number of visitors appeared typical. Some said business was a little slow, but most said it was about the same.
In other heavy Latino locations, some residents were reportedly keeping a low profile.
“We were in Lake Elsinore yesterday (Saturday, July 12,) and the stores were empty. People were telling us they don’t come out until evening,” said immigration rights advocate Dunlap.
“That’s the kind of fear people are living” with, she added.
On Sunday, Dunlap was at a swap meet in Winchester, a small town close to Hemet in Riverside County. Normally, the swap meet would be very crowded – but not this Sunday.
“We’ve come here before and given out a couple of thousand hotline cards,” Dunlap said. “But I’m standing here and literally no one is walking past.”
Another swap market that had much lower attendance Sunday was one outside Cypress College, said Anaheim resident Dariana Diaz, whose father has a stand. “People are scared of the raids.”
In Indio, Coachella and Moreno Valley, advocates noted that local supermarkets frequented by Latino customers had considerably fewer shoppers on Sunday, according to Luz Gallegos, community programs director for the Training Occupational Development Educating Communities (TODEC) Legal Center.
Yet, at least 160 people turned out Sunday for information forums in Perris, Coachella and Victorville, she said. A few attendees had deportation orders.
“People were very interested in identifying the official documents and understanding the difference between an ICE warrant and a search and seizure warrant signed by U.S. magistrate judge,” Gallegos said.
In recent weeks, starting after Trump initially tweeted about deportations, local groups have held numerous seminars, sometimes called “know your rights” forums, telling immigrants how to handle potential contact with ICE officials and how to prepare their families, legally, in case adults are removed from the country without their children.

Trump, the Fed and our resilient economy

Texto completo: What sort of machine is the economy? The common assumption is that it's a fragile and sensitive device, highly responsive to both good and bad government policies. Under this assumption, pessimists worry that one or two wrong moves from Washington will cause it to seize up and optimists think the right change in tax or regulatory policy can supercharge it.
The administration shares this general assumption. Early in Donald Trump's presidency, he and his economic advisers hailed what was coming. With Trump's policies, declared Stephen Moore, "4% growth can and should be the new normal in America." After the president signed his big tax cut, Lawrence Kudlow said, "We're on the front end of an investment boom."
It was a nice fantasy. In 2017, real GDP grew by 2.2%; in 2018, it increased by 2.9%. In 2014 and 2015, under Barack Obama, the figures were 2.5% and 2.9%.
The investment boom hasn't happened. "A slim 5% rise in 2019 capital spending is in store, down from last year's 6% gain," Kiplinger reported last month. "That is a small annual gain compared with past decades, when double-digit increases in capital spending were relatively common."
The administration didn't have any magic dust. Economic growth appears to be settling down around the level that Trump disparaged when Obama was president.
The new normal is not much different from the old normal.
The latest Wall Street Journal survey of 60 economists found that they expect real GDP growth to total less than 2% in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2019. In 2016, the term Moore used for that rate of growth was "sluggish."
"It's no surprise," Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, told Boston's WBUR in May. "Nearly everyone who looked at this, other than the Trump administration itself, felt that this would have very little effect on the economy."
Trump's critics, however, have also exaggerated his importance to the economy. Immediately after the election, Princeton economist and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman predicted a global downturn -- though he quickly retracted that forecast. A year ago, Bank of America Merrill Lynch economist Ethan Harris warned that Trump's trade war could cause a recession.
So far, however, the U.S. economy has kept chugging along. Some sectors, particularly agriculture and autos, have suffered, but their troubles haven't spread too far. The looming prospect of a bigger trade war with China and Europe has yet to throw much sand in the gears.
"If anyone has shown presidents don't matter for the economy, it's Trump," George Mason University economist Tyler Cowen told me. "All the uncertainty simply has not stalled the recovery."
Other economists think Trump has had some effect on the economy. Says John Cochrane of Stanford University and the Hoover Institution, "The recent boost in growth does have something to do with deregulation." Northwestern's Robert Gordon says the tax cut boosted GDP growth, but only temporarily. He also says, "The uncertainties around tariffs and trade have contributed to caution on the part of businesses."
But Trump has made less difference, for good or ill, than most people expected. The evidence suggests that for the most part, the economy is not fragile and flighty but sturdy and resilient. It's not a lightweight canoe that requires endless adjustments and can be knocked off course by every ripple or breeze. It's an aircraft carrier, moving forward in fair weather or foul and not easily stopped.
The tax cut that Trump said would be "rocket fuel" for the economy looks more like regular unleaded. The administration, however, is not about to admit that its policies are mistaken or ineffectual; it has to be that some powerful, sinister force is impeding them.
That would be the Federal Reserve, which the president and his allies blame for not cutting interest rates. But if his policies were as potent as we've been told, they would not wilt because our low interest rates are not a quarter-point or a half-point lower.
Back in 2016, Moore wrote: "The lesson of the Fed under Ben Bernanke and now (Janice) Yellen is that easy money is no economic solution to this decade-long malaise. As economist Larry Kudlow puts it: 'The Fed can print money, but it can't create jobs.'" Now, they see easy money as the only hope.
A multitude of people think they know how to take care of the economy, and often they're wrong. Fortunately, it can usually take care of itself.

Scooter Hell and the death of the sidewalk; Thousands of rentable electric scooters have taken over pavement across the country, clogging narrow sidewalks and lay strewn in the middle of crosswalks

Texto completo: On a summer afternoon in 1894, William Barkalow had a drink or three and got on his horse. He rode it down the central sidewalk of Long Branch, N.J., where horses were, even in those primordial days of traffic regulation, definitely not supposed to go.
Barkalow rode amongst the foot traffic like an electric scooter before its time. The next day's New York Times reported that he paid no heed to a police officer's shouts, nor the billy club flung at him. And while Barkalow didn't trample anyone, his breach of sidewalk ettiquette proved so intolerable that the officer finally shot him between the shoulder blades.
The turn of the century was a rough time in the history of the sidewalk. Ubiquitous strips of not-street were squeezed thinner and thinner to make way for horses, trolleys and eventually lanes of automobiles. The footed masses fought with vendors and construction crews for the leftover pavement as if it were some Mesopotamian riverbed. "The pedestrians now, as formerly, must spend their time in a hurdle race over skids, climb platforms, dodge moving boxes or else run the risk of being crushed under horses' hoofs in the street," the Times complained in 1896, as part of its newly launched "crusade against the sidewalk grabbers."
There's a new kind of sidewalk grabber today - more agile than Barkalow's horse, popping seemingly from nowhere into the paths of pedestrians at 10,15, 20 mph. Thousands of rentable electric scooters have taken over pavement from Norfolk and Virginia Beach to Washington, D.C., to Santa Monica and Austin to Chicago. They clog narrow sidewalks, startle us from our ambulatory texting sessions, and lay strewn in the middle of crosswalks. It's hard to recall a time in living memory when it's been more nerve wracking to attempt a stroll.
***
The physical injuries are one thing: A 75-year-old man tripped over an abandoned scooter in San Diego and shattered his knee.
A 7-year-old boy near Los Angeles reportedly had his teeth knocked out by a scooter rider. A 44-year-old woman was hit by a Bird scooter in a Cincinnati intersection. The assailant had their Bird account suspended, while the woman got a $1,000 medical bill. And on the other side of the gutter, car-on-scooter fatalities are becoming almost commonplace.
But for every broken tooth there are countless jostled states of mind, as pedestrians discover the placid streams by which they travel have been invaded en masse by machines with names like Bird and Jump and Spin and Skip.
Jacob Hege, 22, has walked to work a bit more cautiously since he emerged from a crosswalk on 16th Street NW in Washington and felt something thwack him from behind late last month. He turned to see a woman on a Bird scooter, which like several other brands in the District of Columbia can be found on almost any block and rented for a few dollars.
"We both got knocked to the side," Hege said. "She had AirPods in, and she looked at me with such anger and said, 'Move!' and scooted away. And I stood looking at her like, what?"
Once again, there's a people's crusade to restore the sanctity of the sidewalk, with anti-scooter vigilantes appearing wherever the machines do. Scooters are piled into dumpsters, chucked into rivers, thrown through windshields, set on fire and hung from bridge posts like apparatchiks of a deposed regime.
In Hoboken, N.J. - the state's first major beachhead for scooters - an anonymous Twitter documentarian records rider buzzing strollers and smashing into each other. In Atlanta, a man in a wheelchair who calls himself John Plantaseed has taken to knocking down rows of scooters like chains of dominoes, yelling triumphant obscenities as they clatter to the pavement.
Cities are trying to mitigate the backlash. Washington will begin experimenting with solar powered charging docks, hoping to break riders' habit of dumping the scooters wherever they happen to get off. But sometimes no balance can be found. Nashville's mayor is now seeking to evict all scooters from the streets.
***
We could use some perspective, because this is not the first sidewalk war by any means.
The first known sidewalks were laid in central Anatolia around 2000 B.C. - a millennium or two after the invention of the wheel, according to the book "Sidewalks: Conflict and Negotiation over Public Space." They remained rare luxuries in most of the world until the the 19th century, when the big cities like London and Paris built hundreds of miles of the stuff.
But it took decades of social conditioning before "walk" became the operative syllable in sidewalk. For most of human history, vehicles, pedestrians, vendors, musicians, drinkers and strolling lovers all mingled in the same amorphous muck of the avenue. It's only in the last century or so that those corridors have been divided up, stratified, painted with lines regulated in the name of more efficient movement.
Jaywalkers - a word that did not exist until the early 20th century - were shamed and fined for straying into the street. Non-walkers were similarly penalized from clogging up the precious sidewalks.
"City after city started issuing ordinances prohibiting or regulating a number of sidewalk activities from street vending to political and commercial speech, from the display of wares on the sidewalk to loitering, panhandling, and prostitution," the book reads. Detroit went so far as to paint "huge yellow footsteps" on its sidewalks in the 1920s, lest any ped fail to get the message.
This social order worked fine, except when it didn't. Bicycles, newspaper boxes, mass homelessness, plodding iPhone gazers - all these things disturbed the fiction of a street neatly divided into walkers and cars. Cities simply invented new regulations and lanes to restore the peace, which worked until the next disruption came along, and here we are today in scooter hell.
But is it a hell made by scooters, or just made apparent by them?
"I see this conflict more as an outcome of bad decisions and bad design," said Anastasia Loukaitou-Sideris, co-author of "Sidewalks" and an urban planning professor at the scooter-saturated campus of UCLA. "Cities kept widening the streets and narrowing the sidewalks, and downgrading activities to accommodate only walking. ... I don't mean to say sometimes scooter drivers are not obnoxious. But I'd say it's a less obnoxious use than cars."
Loukaitou-Sideris expects the cities will find a way out of this jam, whether by restricting scooters or squeezing yet more lanes into the finite space between buildings. Sidewalk disputes always resolve one way or the other. Just ask William Barkalow.

Texto completo: Hugh Jackman is the the modern-day equivalent of an old-school entertainer. In other words, he can do it all: He sings, dances, acts and flexes enough box-office muscle to open both Hollywood blockbusters and Broadway musicals.
Now, you can add arena headliner to the mix.
Tonight, he will bring to Glendale his first arena tour, which has been rather awkwardly dubbed "The Man. The Music. The Show." He's no stranger to the concert stage: "Hugh Jackman: Back on Broadway," held court at the Broadhurst Theatre in New York City for three months starting in 2011, and he's done solo engagements in San Francisco and Toronto.
But, obviously, an arena tour is a huge undertaking. He launched the tour in May in Europe before hitting the States in June. The show has been a tremendous success so far: Billboard reports that Jackman could be heading toward a $75 million finish at the box office once it wraps up in October.
The production is directed by Warren Carlyle, a stage director and choreographer known for the 2009 Broadway revival of "Finian's Rainbow." More importantly in this case, he directed "Hugh Jackman: Back on Broadway."
"The Man. The Music. The Show." is designed as a full-scale spectacle that runs more than two hours (including intermission). He will be accompanied by a full orchestra, and there are dancers (naturally) and costume changes.
Keala Settle, who performed "This Is Me" in "The Greatest Showman," has appeared at some tour stops, though she will not appear in Glendale. There is no official word on any guest stars appearing in Glendale.
"I want to ask Sting," Jackman told Playbill about guest stars for the tour. "I just texted James Corden the other day. I was like, 'Dude, when are you coming to the Hollywood Bowl with me?' I hope (to have guests like) Kristin Chenoweth, Sutton Foster or Laura Benanti or Audra McDonald ... By the way I haven't asked any of them yet!"
What he sings Judging from the setlists from previous "TMTMTS" shows, the concert is heavy on songs from "The Greatest Showman." He normally features five tunes from the 2017 musical: "The Greatest Show," "Come Alive," "A Million Dreams," "From Now On" and the biggie, "This Is Me."
That's good news for movie fans, but even more exciting: He digs into the catalog of fellow Aussie Peter Allen, who died in 1992. Jackman won a Tony Award for playing Allen in the jukebox musical "The Boy From Oz," which ran from 2003 to 2004. Jackman will offer Allen's biggest hits, including "Don't Cry Out Loud," "I Honestly Love You" and "Arthur's Theme (Best That You Can Do)." But he also goes deeper into the Allen songbook for "Tenterfield Saddler," a haunting autobiographical song that is one of Allen's most revealing compositions.
Elsewhere, expect more tunes from Broadway, including, of course, a segment devoted to "Les Misérables." He also goes further back into the past, including material associated with two other great song-and-dance men: Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire.
What the critics say Reaction has been almost universally enthusiastic for the tour.
"Though the production bears a pompous title, Jackman, a tremendously fit 50, oozes self-deprecation," Melissa Ruggieri writes in the Atlanta-Journal Constitution. "He's charming and thoughtful, making even his scripted patter sound heartfelt, and a mischievous grin is never more than a fist-thrusting chorus away."
The thought of Jackman playing an arena struck Ross Raihala of the Twin Cities Pioneer Press as odd.
"Last fall's announcement that Jackman was embarking on a 90-date world tour of arenas felt like a bit of a stretch," Raihala writes. "Yeah, he's clearly talented, but is he a big enough draw to sell out such huge venues? Well, Saturday night, on the fourth stop of his tour's North American leg, Jackman filled St. Paul's Xcel Energy Center with an impressively diverse crowd of about 14,000 fans ready to whoop it up with a movie star in a hockey arena."
However, Laura Collins-Hughes, reviewing a performance held at Madison Square Garden for the New York Times, felt Jackman's talents would have been better served in a smaller venue.
"The disconnect made me wish I were nearer — and in that sense, this show is a superb advertisement for the intimacy of Broadway," she writes. "You'd never feel so far away in one of its theaters."
Other critics didn't share the sentiment. John J. Moser, writing for the Morning Call in Allentown, Pennsylvania, had no such qualms.
"Jackman's audience interaction also was mostly delightful," he wrote. "Early in the show, he helped some late arrivers find their seats and got another's ticket laminated as the show went on as a gift. He also was a quick-witted comedian, saying before playing piano on 'You Will Be Found' that, 'clearly I believe three years of piano in high school qualifies you to play in front of arenas.'"
International critics were equally impressed. Ciara O'Brien covered the Dublin stop in June for the Irish Times.
"Jackman isn't afraid to take a couple of chances with his material, and the audience is right there with him. From the moment Jackman appears on stage – kicking off with 'The Greatest Show' naturally – he has the audience in the palm of his hand."
Perhaps no one was clearer than Mark Fisher, reviewing the star's opening night in Glasgow, for the Guardian. The headline: "He really is the Greatest Showman."

Delivering a little extra can boost customer loyalty

Texto completo: After finishing an incredible meal in the French Quarter of New Orleans, the best part of the experience may very well be the lagniappe (pronounced LAN-yap). While it sounds like a fancy seafood dish, a lagniappe is actually an unexpected gift.
That special dessert, compliments of the chef. The small box of chocolates for you to take home. The ice cold sorbet to cleanse your palate between courses. The fact that it comes as a surprise makes it all the more special.
In my own businesses, we have a cruder mantra: "Don't forget the dinner mint." It's a persistent reminder to always deliver that little extra something. We strive to constantly deliver lagniappes on every project and with every stakeholder, internal or external.
Over deliver Obviously, a lagniappe can be a physical gift such as the 13th doughnut free when buying a dozen. But it can also represent unexpected over-delivery in any context. If you've been asked to research four competitors for a big meeting, think how delighted your boss will feel when you deliver five. If your client is expecting eight new ideas for a new marketing campaign, showing up with 11 will blow them away.
Jack Welch, the former CEO of General Electric, often said the way to get ahead in business is to deliver what's asked of you — to a tee — but then always show up with something more. That additional, unexpected slice of value on a consistent basis is a surefire way to drive career advancement, according to Welch.
In today's highly competitive environment, meeting client expectations is merely the ante to play. But tossing in a lagniappe can be the difference maker to driving customer loyalty and growth.
Just a few pennies Fortunately, these little extras need not break the bank. DoubleTree Hotels became wildly successful by offering warm chocolate chip cookies upon check in. Just a few pennies of cost drove millions in shareholder value as customers savored treats while booking up hotel rooms. The prize inside CrackerJack, the iconic popcorn brand, drove far more customer loyalty and growth than the core product itself.
As you serve your customers, colleagues, and partners, consider adding lagniappes of your own. A tiny over-delivery can drive a tremendous boost in satisfaction and loyalty. Sprinkle in that unexpected dose of extra value, and your stock will rise at an unprecedented rate.
The next time you're about to deliver work product — internally or externally — pause briefly to ensure you've topped it off with a lagniappe. Simply put, don't forget the dinner mint.

Incredible kidneys, photogenic toxins, delusional Brits, and more from the week online

Texto completo: ORGAN FAILURE
Look, we've all been there: Stayed up too late, slept in too late, coffee not working, and suddenly you're expected to discuss a new kidney health initiative before a large assembly. Easy enough, right? Just Wikipedia some kidney stuff in the Uber over, copy some stats into a blank note, anchor some sentiments about the critical importance of kidney health with some personal experience (which you likely have given how common kidney disease is), knock back another coffee, and you're ready to dazzle. Or, if you're the president , just waltz up to the podium and sweet-talk the organ as though it could hear you: “The kidney. Very special. The kidney has a very special place in the heart. It's an incredible thing." Indeed, truly incredible. What were we talking about again? Ah yes, kidneys. (All that coffee is really bad for them, you know.)
POSING DANGER
Elsewhere in filtered toxins, a New York Times story highlighted a wildly popular spot for Instagrammers in Siberia (not a typo) colloquially known as the “Maldives of Novosibirsk" but more technically known as a massive man-made waste pool for a nearby electrical plant. The abundance of calcium salts, metal oxides, and other toxins in the “water" lend it an iridescent blue hue, luring selfie snappers desperate for the perfect faux-tropical shot to its shores (and sometimes even into the slurry itself). And according to locals, the third arm is like having a natural selfie stick. 
SAY WHAT?
A runaway Twitter thread this past week collected what one contributor called “read-it-never-said-its" — i.e. words you learn by reading but fail at properly saying. Like “Epitome but like it rhymes with home" (that's Lin-Manuel Miranda , btw), or “banal, and it was embarrassing,"  or “Meme. Certain it was, 'me me'," or my own trouble with biopic — which still conjures up what sounds like a painful medical procedure when I see it. Or GIF, which we will never agree on, so let's just keep moving, even though it's clearly pronounced /jif/. I said keep moving. 
NO LOVE LOST
And lastly this week from the crazyverse, one in eight British men (i.e. 12 percent of the population) responded in all seriousness to a YouGov poll that, given an opportunity, they believed they could win a point against 23-time Grand Slam title winner Serena Williams . And should you require an additional punch line, let's go with, “Turns out not everything said with a British accent sounds smarter."

FACEBOOK REPORTEDLY FINED $5 BILLION

Texto completo: Facebook has agreed to pay a record $5 billion settlement with the Federal Trade Commission after a yearlong investigation into the company's privacy practices, according to multiple reports Friday.
Citing unnamed sources, the Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post and The New York Times reported that the FTC this week voted to approve the settlement, which was born out of last year's Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal involving the personal data of Facebook users. If the reported amount is correct, it would be the biggest fine ever imposed by the United States on a tech company. It would dwarf a $22 million FTC fine on Google in 2012.
The FTC reportedly voted 3-2 on the settlement, with the agency's Democratic commissioners opposing the deal because they were pushing for more restrictions on the company. Facebook has been under fire for years over how it protects and shares the data of its more than 2 billion users.
An FTC spokeswoman said Friday that the agency would have no comment. A Facebook spokeswoman said the company was not confirming the reports and would have no comment.
After the news last year that political data consulting firm Cambridge Analytica accessed the personal information of up to 87 million Facebook users without their explicit consent, the FTC opened an investigation into whether the Silicon Valley tech giant had violated a 2011 settlement regarding its privacy practices.
In April as it reported quarterly results, Facebook said it was setting aside $3 billion in anticipation of a fine, which it expected to reach up to $5 billion.
Facebook critics, including advocacy groups that have decried the company's privacy and other policies, were quick to slam the reported deal.
"A fine no matter how large is not enough," David Segal, executive director of Demand Progress Education Fund, said
in a statement Friday. "It is clear that Facebook has too much power and is too big to manage. A Federal Trade Commission that was serious about its job would push for structural reforms like spinning off Instagram and WhatsApp that would create competition in the social media space and make Facebook more likely to respect its users."
The privacy mess involving Cambridge Analytica a now-defunct firm that was co-founded by Steve Bannon and used by the presidential campaign of Donald Trump prompted Congress to summon Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to Washington last year and shareholders to call for him to step down as chairman of the company's board. The scandal sparked closer scrutiny and further criticism of the tech industry from advocacy groups, politicians and others, some of whom have called for breaking up Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple. Last month, after reports that the federal government is considering antitrust investigations into tech giants, House lawmakers said they were also looking into possible anti-competitive behavior by the companies.
"Despite Republicans' promises to hold big tech accountable, the FTC appears to have failed miserably at its best opportunity to do so," Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said in a statement Friday. "The only way to assure Americans that our private data will be protected is to pass a strong privacy bill, like the one I plan to introduce in the coming weeks."
But another advocacy group, the Center for Democracy and Technology, held off on criticizing the settlement, noting Friday that the deal could include more restrictions on how Facebook handles user data.
"The FTC has put all companies on notice that they must safeguard personal information," Nuala O'Connor, CDT president and CEO, said in a statement. The group accepts funding from tech companies, including Facebook.
Any settlement would need approval from the Department of Justice, which does not usually reject FTC decisions.
Shares of Facebook, which had closed Friday up 1.8% to $204.87, were up slightly in after-hours trading.
"This was expected by Wall Street," said Laura Martin, analyst for Needham & Co., on Friday.

Trump, allies pull a Libby Schaaf; President called out Oakland mayor after she tipped residents to ICE raids. Then he did the same thing.

Texto completo: When Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf tipped residents off last year that immigration agents would be conducting enforcement operations, President Trump called her actions a "disgrace."
A Republican congressman from Iowa proposed criminal penalties for officials in so-called sanctuary cities who made similar disclosures.
The acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement director at the time, Thomas Homan, said Schaaf was "no better than a gang lookout yelling 'police!' when a police cruiser comes in the neighborhood."

Then, in the last month, Trump himself announced impending immigration operations over Twitter. On Friday morning, he reaffirmed that the operations to remove a large number of immigrants in the country illegally were set to proceed, stating that there was "nothing to be secret about."
"If the word gets out, it gets out. It starts on Sunday," Trump told reporters outside the White House. "They're going to take people out and they're going to bring them back to their countries."
ICE is expected to pursue at least 2,000 immigrants beginning Sunday.
And the Trump administration, it seemed, had pulled a Libby Schaaf.
Critics have said that Trump is touting operations to drum up support for his reelection campaign and believe tweets and leaks have removed the element of surprise for ICE.
"I've never seen anything like this, where they're highlighting an operation in advance," said John Sandweg, who headed ICE under President Obama. "Those people who were in the agency criticizing the Oakland mayor, I don't think you can credibly say there's a distinction here between what the administration has done."
Schaaf said as much last month: "I ... find it a bit ironic that a president who was so critical of my informing my community about the potential of a raid has himself now warned the entire nation."
Schaaf's office said she was unavailable for comment.
The Oakland mayor's warning won cheers in California, where many oppose Trump's immigration crackdown. When the new operations were announced a few weeks ago, many political leaders in California denounced them, with some urging those targeted to know their rights and report any abuses to the proper officials.
Some California law enforcement agencies have emphasized that they are not taking part in the immigration actions.
Schaaf issued her warning last year before a sweep that ended in more than 150 arrests.
Oakland, like many California cities, has declared itself a sanctuary for those here illegally.
In slamming the mayor's decision, Homan accused her of threatening the safety of immigration officers by publicizing operations before they happen.
"The Oakland mayor's decision to publicize her suspicions about ICE operations further increased that risk for my officers and alerted criminal aliens -- making clear that this reckless decision was based on her political agenda with the very federal laws that ICE is sworn to uphold," Homan said in a statement at the time.
Beginning this weekend, ICE is expected to pursue at least 2,000 immigrants who have missed a court appearance or been ordered removed from the country, according to reporting Thursday by the New York Times. The operations are expected to take place in 10 named cities across the U.S.
Matthew D. Bourke, an ICE spokesman, would not confirm the pending operations or offer further details, citing "law enforcement sensitivities and the safety and security of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement personnel."
"As always, ICE prioritizes the arrest and removal of unlawfully present aliens who pose a threat to national security, public safety and border security," he said in a Thursday statement. "However, all of those in violation of the immigration laws may be subject to immigration arrest, detention and -- if found removable by final order -- removal from the United States."
Although Trump said the operations would begin this weekend, an ICE official cast doubt on that in an interview Friday.
"The operation is not going to start Sunday, but that doesn't mean it might not start next week. It might have already started," said the official, who declined to be identified because the person was not authorized to speak. "We don't want anybody to know when we're doing these operations. We don't advertise them, we don't appreciate when others advertise them ... there's a reason we don't put it out, no matter who we're going after."
ICE typically conducts large-scale operations three or four times during the year and generally averages 40 to 50 arrests a day during larger operations, an agent previously told The Times.
Those operations specifically target public safety threats, such as convicted criminals and individuals who have violated immigration laws. Last year in California, ICE conducted at least four operations that spanned several days, resulting in nearly 700 arrests.
On Friday, ICE announced that deportation officers in San Diego had arrested 20 people during a five-day enforcement surge focused on immigration fugitives with a final removal order and a criminal conviction or a criminal charge. The weeklong operation ended Thursday. ICE officers in Los Angeles reportedly just finished a similar operation. These operations are separate from the one Trump has cited.
Ninety percent of those arrested by ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations in fiscal year 2018 had either a criminal conviction or convictions, pending criminal charges, were an ICE fugitive, or illegally reentered the country after previously being removed, according to the agency.
Last June, agents gathered for a 5 a.m. briefing in the parking lot of a Compton shopping mall, where they reviewed the target list they had spent weeks putting together. A reporter who went on the ride with the team was required to embargo information about the operation until it was over.
Those embargoes are typical, Sandweg said. Congressional notifications and news releases go out after operations, he added.
On the first day of such operations, agents typically are able to get most of their targets "because of the element of surprise," Sandweg said.
"By Day 2, 3, 4, 5, word has gotten out that we're conducting this type of operation and people are gone," Sandweg said. "We knew that once word got out that the effectiveness of the operation would be limited."
If suspects know where and when officers are coming, they can either avoid the situation entirely or become confrontational, said Sid Heal, a retired L.A. County sheriff's commander and use-of-force expert.
When a plan is compromised, meaning the suspect becomes aware of it, in many situations the operation will be canceled and rescheduled, he said.
Although Heal believes Trump provided only general information about the operation, he added that "personally, I wouldn't have done it."
"I err on the side of safety, personally. If there is some value in using the threat of arrests to increase the compliance with the laws, I'm all for it," Heal said. "As far as specific information, I just stay away from it."
When Los Angeles police officers plan to serve arrest warrants or are working on investigations, it's important to try to keep details from leaking, said Assistant Chief Robert Arcos. In the case of a dangerous suspect, officer safety could be compromised if details got out.
"We try to do our best to keep everything very close to the vest," Arcos said. "So, the folks who need to know and have the right to know, versus kind of broadcasting ahead of time."
When Trump first announced enforcement operations, officials, lawyers and advocates across the country -- including in Los Angeles -- scrambled to prepare.
The Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of L.A. has been holding "know your rights" workshops and telling community members to come in to speak with immigration attorneys to be screened for immigration relief, said Shannon Camacho, the coalition's campaign coordinator.
"Knowing ahead of time that there may be operations coming to Los Angeles ... we are now preparing everybody," she said. "That's something that we wouldn't have the opportunity to do if we knew about an operation after the fact or while it was happening."

SWALWELL DROPS OUT; STEYER STEPS IN

Texto completo: Eric Swalwell dropped out of the presidential race Monday after his long-shot bid failed to gain traction among voters.
The East Bay congressman will run for reelection for a fifth term, he said at a news conference at his Dublin campaign headquarters, attributing his decision to leave the presidential contest to anemic fundraising and poll numbers.
"We wanted to be honest with ourselves and our supporters," Swalwell said. "If there was a viable chance, I wouldn't be standing here today."
Swalwell wasalmost immediatelyreplaced in the presidential race by another Democrat from the Bay Area. San Francisco megadonor and former hedge fund chief Tom Steyer, who had said he wouldn't run for president in January, flopped and announced his candidacy in a video message on Monday.
Swalwell, 38, jumped into the race in April and hoped that his message of generational change could make him a contender. He staked out unique positions on issues such as gun control, calling for the federal government to ban and buy back all assault weapons in the U.S.
But while he got in one memorable line in last month's debate using front-runner Joe Biden's past words against him in calling for the former vice president to "pass the torch" to a new generation Swalwell acknowledged that his campaign failed to gain momentum. He hasn't received even 1% in any polls approved by the Democratic National Committee in more than a month.
It seemed likely he would miss the second debate in late July, with Montana Gov. Steve Bullock apparently getting enough support in polls to beat him for the 20th spot on the debate stage. In addition, Swalwell's first campaign fundraising report is due next week, and he said Monday it would show him raising only about $850,000, far behind the race's top candidates and less than even some congressional hopefuls.
Swalwell insisted he held no regrets from his three-month-old White House bid and said his campaign had pushed the top candidates to take stronger stances on gun control issues. "I moved the needle on the debate stage on an issue I'm very passionate about," he said.
Still, he could face a fight to keep his East Bay seat. Hayward City Councilwoman Aisha Wahab, a favorite of local progressives and one of the first Afghan American elected officials in the U.S., has already announced a bid for the congressional district, earning several endorsements from local and state elected officials. Wahab has said she would "re-evaluate" her campaign if Swalwell chose to run for reelection. Swalwell said Monday that the two hadn't spoken.
"Decisions.. Decisions.." Wahab tweeted Monday.
One of her backers, BART board member Lateefah Simon, said she planned to "keep her word" and support Wahab against Swalwell if the two faced off, even as she called him an "awesome" representative.
"Women of color shouldn't be scared to dip our toes into these highly contested races, even if we believe there's a strong incumbent," Simon said Monday morning. "That's what democracy is for."
Swalwell's decision was hardly unexpected. Last week, he skipped a New Hampshire campaign swing, raising eyebrows among Democrats about his staying power in the race. Joe Perry, an organizer with the local Epping, New Hampshire, Democratic Party, said a Swalwell staffer had called him to cancel a July 3 meet-and-greet event just hours before it was scheduled to begin after spending multiple weeks getting it on the books.
"I was distressed to say the least," Perry said. "I assumed at that point he was dropping out of the race."
Swalwell also was scheduled to appear at several other events on July 3 and 4, including walking in multiple parades around the state. "They didn't really give me any explanation other than he wanted to spend the Fourth of July with his family," said Carlos Cardona, the chair of the Laconia, New Hampshire, Democratic Party, with whom Swalwell had been expected to walk.
Swalwell is the first presidential candidate to drop out since the 2020 race truly kicked off, and he could be the first of a wave of contenders to make their exits over the next few weeks. The debate qualification requirements will scale up drastically for the September forums, likely shutting at least half of the more than two dozen candidates out of the spotlight.
Meanwhile, Steyer could be the last Democrat to jump in. The San Francisco billionairehas spent millions of dollars on a campaign urging Congress to impeach President Donald Trump.
Steyer confirmed to The Associated Press on Tuesday that he would spend at least $100 million on his campaign, a figure that was first reported by The New York Times.
It would be a tough climb for Steyer to get the number of donors and poll support necessary to get into the presidential debates. But if he invests his considerable fortune into a campaign, he could make an impact and force the other candidates to take a stand on his key issues such as impeachment and fighting climate change.
The fact that huge longshots such as Swalwell and Steyer are taking a swing at the White House is a testament to how wide open the 2020 race is.
"For a lot of these folks, their odds are long but they may figure this is their best shot in their life," said Jack Pitney, a politics professor at Claremont McKenna College and a former Republican operative. "It's better to take the shot and fail than spend the rest of your life wondering about what might have been."

As threat of raids loom, immigrants in Boston brace for the worst

Texto completo: Business owners are offering rides to work for employees living in the country illegally. Neighbors are buying groceries for people too nervous to go out and shop. Mothers are gently trying to tell their children they might have to be apart for a little while.
Reports that the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency is planning to launch nationwide raids over this weekend and arrest thousands of undocumented immigrants have sparked alarm and uncertainty in immigrant communities in Massachusetts, causing many to retreat to the shadows in fear.
“Nobody knows what to do," said Yocelen, 22, who gave only her first name to avoid detection. She crossed the border a year ago after leaving Guatemala with her 5-year-old son and now lives in the Boston area.
“They don't know if they can go out and even go shopping because they don't know if [ICE] will grab you," Yocelen said.
The operation is expected to take place over multiple days in at least 10 major cities, according to The New York Times, which first reported the planned raids.
Mayor Martin J. Walsh said Boston was not among the targeted cities, but immigrant advocates said no one knows what, exactly, to expect in Massachusetts. The administration has taken a hard line on illegal immigration and has vowed to step up deportations to discourage illegal immigration at the southwestern border. But last month, the administration threatened to carry out raids against undocumented families before agreeing to delay its plans at the last minute.
“The panic that's out there is alarming," said Gladys Ortiz, who works at REACH, a nonprofit that helps victims of domestic violence and works closely with immigrants and their families. Ortiz said her phone has been ringing constantly with calls from frightened immigrants, including a mother of five who called in tears, asking if she could find space for her family at a shelter for a few days.
“My head is like. 'Oh my God,' " Ortiz said. Women “keep calling me and ask, 'What am I going to do? What am I going to do?' "
On Friday, President Trump told reporters the raids will focus on criminals but acknowledged that his administration would arrest anyone who came to the United States illegally.
The sweeps are meant to target immigrants facing deportation orders but will include “collateral" deportations of undocumented immigrants who are present during targeted arrests, according to The New York Times.
In East Boston, an “emergency community education session" is scheduled for Saturday at the public library on South Bremen Street. On Thursday, people packed the office of the consulate of El Salvador in East Boston, where representatives from countries such as Honduras, Peru, Colombia, and Mexico gathered to provide immigrants information about their rights.
About 250,000 unauthorized immigrants live in Massachusetts, according to a 2016 estimate by the Pew Research Center.
Walsh said city police would have no role in helping ICE detain immigrants. In Chelsea, which has a high concentration of immigrants, Police Chief Brian Kyes offered similar assurances.
“The enforcement of our nation's civil immigration laws are the primary responsibility of the federal government," Kyes said in a statement. “Accordingly, all Chelsea residents can be assured that the officers of the Chelsea Police Department shall not and will not undertake or become involved in any civil immigration-related investigations that do not have a direct nexus to criminal activity."
Around East Boston, residents in the largely immigrant neighborhood said they have been on high alert for days.
José Goméz, who owns a convenience store in East Boston, has offered to deliver goods from his store to fearful customers who have not left their homes in days. He has at least six employees who are unauthorized immigrants, and he has offered to drive them all into work so they can minimize the risk of arrest.
“It's stressful," Goméz said. “We have to try to help them."
Wilder Cerrate, 19, thought of his cousins as he stood outside the East Boston Social Centers where he had just picked up his sister from an after-school program.
Cerrate, who is in the country legally, said he is worried about what will happen to family members who are not.
“It's just bracing yourself for impact," Cerrate said.
People are “practicing their lines," he said, by reminding themselves they do not have to answer their doors unless an ICE officer has a court order or warrant signed by a judge.
“We try to keep calm," Cerrate said. “We try not to let it take over our whole lives. It's a type of calm where you actively have anxiety in the back of your head."
Rosa, a 42-year-old Guatemalan woman who is living with her 20-year-old daughter, said she is trying to be pragmatic and maintain her regular life.
“We have to keep working," said Rosa. “We have to make money to buy food, clothes, and shoes."
Rosa, who asked to be identified by just her first name, said her daughter is terrified of going to work this weekend at her job tending to the grounds of golf courses. Rosa, who cleans offices and houses for a living, advised her daughter to go to work.
“Ask God for help," she said she told her. “Only God can protect us."
Yocelen, the young Guatemalan woman, said she won't dare leave her apartment.
“I don't even want to go out on the street for fear that [ICE] will take me away," she said. She dreads returning to Guatemala, which she fled after drug dealers threatened her and came to her home because police told them she had reported their activities to the authorities.
“They'll kill me," Yocelen said. “They never forget anything."

DAMARISCOTTA — Skidompha Library’s Chats with Champions will feature Arlie Russell Hochschild at 10 a.m. Thursday in the Skidompha Library’s Porter Meeting Hall on Main Street. Please allow time for parking.
Hochschild is a renowned professor emerita of sociology at the University of California, Berkeley. Her Chat with Champions at the library will focus on her latest title, “Strangers in Their Own Land: Anger and Mourning on the American Right,” a New York Times Best Seller and finalist for the 2016 National Book Award, according to a news release from the library.
In an era in which most of us live in our own “political bubble,” Hochschild dared to venture from liberal Democratic Berkeley, California, to conservative Republican Lake Charles, Louisiana. By the time Donald Trump had won election to the United States presidency in 2016, Hochschild had spent five years immersed in the “deep story” of a nation grappling with its identity. Her Chat with Champions will unpack the political trends that elected Trump and offer solutions for moving forward.

'She is not a racist': Trump sides with Speaker Nancy Pelosi in spat with progressives

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has an unlikely defender: President Donald Trump.
Trump stuck up for Pelosi on Friday after freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York ramped up her criticism of the Democratic speaker.
Ocasio-Cortez accused Pelosi earlier this week of singling out “newly elected women of color” for criticism. Ocasio-Cortez’s comments and an earlier tweet by her chief of staff injected the possibility of racism into an ongoing spat between Pelosi and the progressive wing of the House Democratic Caucus.
Trump, who has had more than his own share of run-ins with Pelosi, came to her defense.
"I'll tell you something about Nancy Pelosi that you know better than I do: She is not a racist,” Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday before departing for a trip to Wisconsin and Ohio.
Trump slammed Ocasio-Cortez for being “very disrespectful” to Pelosi. He added, “For them to call her a racist is a disgrace. ”
The conflict between Pelosi and the progressive wing of her caucus stems from a debate over a spending package for humanitarian relief on the southern U. S. border.
Ocasio-Cortez and other progressive Democrats had wanted to add stronger protections for migrants in the initial House draft of the bill. Pelosi later caved to Republicans and allowed the House to pass the Senate version of the bill, which lacked many of the protections progressive Democrats had sought.
More: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib fire back at Nancy Pelosi's 'Twitter world' quip
Ocasio-Cortez's chief of staff Saikat Chakrabarti took to Twitter and complained that Democrats were propping up a broken system that “fuels a racist ideology. ”
The spat escalated when Pelosi, in an interview with The New York Times, responded to opposition about the bill by Ocasio-Cortez and freshman Reps. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn. ; Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass. ; and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich.
“They’re just four people,” she said of the freshmen lawmakers.
Ocasio-Cortez fired back, calling Pelosi’s comments “just outright disrespectful” in an interview with The Washington Post and complained about “the explicit singling out of newly elected women of color. ”
Ocasio-Cortez is of Puerto Rican descent and Pressley is African American. Omar is a Somali immigrant, while Tlaib is Palestinian American.
Trump's defense of Pelosi comes as he himself is feuding with former House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Republican who, according to excerpts from an upcoming book, said Trump didn't know "anything about government. "
Trump responded with a series of insults on Twitter in which he called Ryan "a long running lame duck failure" and said his record was "atrocious. "

Texto completo: Immigrant advocates sued Thursday to block President Trump's threatened roundup of thousands of undocumented families this weekend.
The White House insists the raids - the same that Trump scrapped last month - will target immigrant families that have already been given deportation orders.
But the ACLU says many of them have never had a day in court due to massive bureaucratic bungling.
"The Trump administration's threats against immigrants run roughshod over basic fairness and due process," said Donna Lieberman, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union. "We will fight to ensure no one faces this kind of peril without having their case considered in court."
The suit was filed in Manhattan Federal Court on behalf of refugees from Central America, many of whom say they have tried without success to get hearings.
It demands that anyone detained be granted a hearing before being deported.
Many refugees say they were ordered deported after not being notified of hearings or told to show up at the wrong locations or on days that don't exist, like Sept. 31.
New York Attorney General Letitia James denounced the planned raids and vowed the state would not cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.
"The Trump administration's insistence on using migrant families as a political bargaining chip with congressional leaders is as deplorable as it is un-American," she said.
Trump had made a similar threat to round up immigrant families last month. He reportedly revived the plan after his deadline for Democrats to "solve" immigration woes predictably went nowhere.
The latest crackdown is now set for Sunday, Homeland Security officials told CNN and the New York Times. Trump often issues such threats of drastic actions on a variety of pet issues only to modify or reverse them at the last minute.

'Slave Play' Is Bound For Broadway This Fall

Texto completo: There are a handful of adjectives that frequently feature in Broadway marketing materials. "Transgressive" is not one of them.
This fall, a group of producers is planning to change that. They are making the risky move of bringing to the Golden Theater one of the most buzzed-about Off Broadway shows of last season -- "Slave Play," a daring, provocative, unsettling, polarizing, and yes, transgressive look at race relations through the prism of the sexual hangups of three interracial couples.
The play was written by Jeremy O. Harris, 30, who began working on it in 2016, during his first semester at the Yale School of Drama; he graduated from the program this spring, and the play will be his Broadway debut.
"I'm very excited, mainly because when I was growing up, all the plays I revered were by writers who had worked on Broadway," Mr. Harris said in an interview.
"Slave Play" is intentionally outrageous, set in a group therapy workshop testing an imaginary technique called "antebellum sexual performance therapy," in which the couples use explicit sexual role play, set on a plantation but punctured by pop songs, to work through their issues.
"The play is about entanglement, and about the wound inside of America that has gone unhealed for too long," Mr. Harris said.
The production will be directed by Robert O'Hara and produced by Greg Nobile, Jana Shea and Troy Carter, along with Level Forward, which is Abigail Disney's company, and Nine Stories, which is a venture from Jake Gyllenhaal and Riva Marker.
Mr. Nobile and Ms. Shea are partners in Seaview Productions, which is also producing "Sea Wall/A Life," a pair of monologues performed by Mr. Gyllenhaal and Tom Sturridge, on Broadway this summer. Mr. Carter, producing on Broadway for the first time, helped guide the careers of Lady Gaga and John Legend. A former Spotify executive, he this year started a new music company, Q&A.
"Slave Play" is scheduled to begin previews Sept. 10 and to open Oct. 6. The producers said that they would make 10,000 tickets to the show available for $ 39 in an effort to broaden access.
The run is scheduled for 17 weeks; casting has not yet been announced.
"Slave Play" had a production last winter at New York Theater Workshop, also directed by Mr. O'Hara; it attracted rave reviews, but also prompted controversy and criticism that could intensify as the play gets more attention. Mr. Harris said that much of the controversy over the Off Broadway run was prompted by a photograph of the production, rather than the play itself, but that he was ready for a variety of reactions.
"People have a lot of unchecked emotions around these histories, and they should feel explosive, because it's explosively relevant to who we are," he said. "I just hope the controversy is a controversy of ideas and not a controversy of hyperbole."
Writing in The New York Times, Jesse Green called the drama "willfully provocative, gaudily transgressive and altogether staggering," while Wesley Morris said "'Slave Play' is the single most daring thing I've seen in a theater in a long time." Many critics agreed, but not all; in The Guardian, Hubert Adjei-Kontoh wrote that "the play may simply give white people yet another platform to gaze on black bodies exposed to physical and sexual violence while simultaneously patting themselves on the back for 'surviving' the experience."
Mr. Harris said he did not plan to make substantial changes before the play is presented at the Golden. He said he was heartened by the success last season on Broadway of plays like "What the Constitution Means to Me," which is about the treatment of women in American legal history.
"People are ready to see something that feels different and is more challenging," he said. "We're at this moment, after the last season, where maybe the freaks can come hang out in the commercial landscape."
He also argued that the play's provocations are not that unusual in American culture. "The ideas inside of 'Slave Play' are not so radical," he said. "And the things that happen on the stage happen every week in 'Game of Thrones.' "

Texto completo: Welcome to the Climate Fwd: newsletter. The New York Times climate team emails readers once a week with stories and insights about climate change. Sign up here to get it in your inbox.
By Lisa Friedman and Hiroko Tabuchi
It's difficult to figure out who's funding climate denial, because many of the think tanks that continue to question established climate science are nonprofit groups that aren't required to disclose their donors. That's true of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a free-market research organization in Washington that disputes that climate change is a problem.
So, the program for a recent gala organized by the institute, which included a list of corporate donors, offered a rare glimpse into the money that makes the work of these think tanks possible.
Among the sponsors for the Game of Thrones-themed gala were groups that have long been aligned with fossil fuel interests, including the Charles Koch Institute and the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers. The fuel and petrochemical group, which lobbies for gasoline producers, pushed to weaken car fuel economy standards, one of the Obama administration's landmark climate policies.
But the program for the event, obtained by The New York Times and verified by the Competitive Enterprise Institute, also included major corporations, like Google and Amazon, that have made their commitment to addressing climate change a key part of their corporate public relations strategies.
Those companies both signed a pledge of support for the Paris Agreement and joined a coalition that vowed to stick to the climate pact's goals after President Trump announced the United States would withdraw from it.
A Google representative said the tech giant's support of the gala did not necessarily mean it supports climate denial. "We've been extremely clear that Google's sponsorship doesn't mean that we endorse that organization's entire agenda," said a spokesman for the tech giant, whose manager for outreach was listed on the dinner's host committee.
A spokeswoman for Amazon, where employees have been urging the company's chief executive, Jeff Bezos, to adopt a climate change policy, said the company "may not agree with all of the positions of each organization," but believed that its $ 15,000 contribution to the event "will help advance policy objectives aligned with our interests."
Analysts at C.E.I. do advocate on a wide range of policies, including opposing antitrust laws, an issue dear to tech and telecom giants as well as other major corporations.
Still, the organization is arguably best known for its work disputing the science of climate change, and the corporations' support comes at a time when the think tank has played an outsized role in the Trump administration. The head of the environment program at the C.E.I., Myron Ebell, led the Trump administration's transition team at the Environmental Protection Agency, spearheaded the opposition to the Paris Agreement.
How does the C.E.I. itself view corporate America's support? In a statement, the organization's president, Kent Lassman, was clear. The institute asks support from those, he said, that "share our values."

One thing you can do: Be a climate communicator
By Tik Root
So, you're committed to reducing your carbon footprint and you've identified the individual actions that work for you. Great! But what next?
Try talking to others about climate change.
"Family and friends are our most trusted source of information," said Connie Roser-Renouf, an associate professor at George Mason University who specializes in science communication. "Talking about what you do and giving people a sense that they can do to make a difference is extremely important."
One example, Dr. Roser-Renouf said, is the strong link between parents and children in terms of attitudes toward climate change. A recent study found that children talking to their parents about the issue can have a big influence. "The parents get more engaged," she said, "and everyone does more."
Another study found that people were better at conserving electricity when the power company informed them of their neighbors' energy usage. Research published in June concluded that "perceived social consensus is associated with a higher percentage of people who believe climate change is real and human-caused."
Yale Climate Connections has guides on how to talk about climate at social gatherings, and to children. The Times also has advice on discussing climate change with young people. Dr. Roser-Renouf says the first step in talking to others is to find out how they feel about the issue, then you talk about why you care about the issue.
Connecting climate change to your local community often provides a good point of reference, she said. Asking someone to become part of a group that you participate in can also be effective, she noted, pointing out that such a request is among the top reasons that people join an organization.
Regardless, Dr. Roser-Renouf says that being a climate communicator is a critical contribution. "Interpersonal communication is much more powerful than mass media information," she said. "It's the people we talk to and care about that persuade us."

Low Unemployment, Inflation Rates Worry Fed

Texto completo: WI Staff Report
Inflation has been low despite a stable labor market, as employers are fearful of raising prices and alienating consumers but are more willing to hire workers with limited experience or even criminal records.
But such developments pose a challenge for the Federal Reserve, since moderate price increases typically have a positive effect on the economy without crushing profits or making consumer products unaffordable.
But labor costs, which usually rise as unemployment rates fall and employers have to compete for workers, have been somewhat mitigated by companies relaxing their standards and mining less expensive sources of candidates.
The sluggish inflation and uneasy economy has left the Federal Reserve hesitant to lower interest rates, putting it at odds with President Trump, who favors cutting the rates.
James Bullard, president of Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, told The New York Times that the lower inflation rates are a sign the economy is "going in the wrong direction."
Officials will meet this year to review and strategize ways to counteract future economic problems.

The ignorant trashing of Alex Acosta

Texto completo: As anyone who has ever watched Law & Order knows, in the criminal justice system, prosecutors enter into plea agreements with defendants for any number of reasons: to spare the victim the pain of testifying, to expedite punishment, to reduce the risk that a guilty person will be acquitted, etc. Better to secure a plea and some form of penalty than take the chance that the perp goes free and faces no repercussions at all.
That’s exactly what happened more than a decade ago when now-Secretary of Labor Alexander Acosta was the U.S. Attorney in Miami, and his office reached a deal with billionaire sex predator Jeffrey Epstein.
As anyone who hasn’t been living under a rock knows, Epstein is a repulsive man with a fetish for teenage girls. The case against him originated in 2005 when local police were tipped off that Epstein was paying girls from West Palm Beach for sexual acts.
Police brought the case to the local prosecutor, Barry Krischer, an elected Democratic official. But Krischer wasn’t interested in pursuing felony charges against Epstein, a well-known donor to political candidates (mostly Democrats).
According to a 2006 article in the New York Times, Palm Beach Police Chief Michael Reiter accused Krischer of giving Epstein special treatment and called for Krischer to recuse himself. When Krischer refused, Reiter took the case to federal law enforcement.
Federal prosecutors, it is important to note, generally have no jurisdiction over sex crimes. But they agreed to investigate whether Epstein violated federal law by, among other things, using the facilities of interstate commerce to induce young girls into prostitution.
After a thorough investigation, the U.S. Attorney’s Office determined that federal charges against Epstein might not stick. But they were able to leverage their investigation to extract a plea.
Under the proposed deal, Epstein would plead guilty to two state prostitution charges, serve 18 months in jail, and register as a sex offender. In exchange, the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Miami would not bring federal charges.
Much has been made of the fact that Epstein was released five months early and that, during his confinement, he was allowed to leave jail to work during the day, returning to his cell only in the evenings. But state authorities made no objection to these cushy accommodations and were not part of the plea deal agreed to by Acosta.
While the punishment was inadequate to the crime, from all reports, the experienced, career prosecutors reporting to Acosta felt it was better than any alternative. The deal put Epstein behind bars, allowed his victims to seek restitution, and put the public on notice that Epstein is a sexual predator. Notably, it also allowed the FBI to continue its investigation.
Earlier this week, federal authorities in New York indicted Epstein on charges of sex trafficking and conspiracy for abusing dozens of minor girls at his homes in Manhattan and Palm Beach between 2002 and 2005.
And yet, the vultures are now circling — not Epstein, but Acosta, claiming the former U.S. attorney acted improperly by not bringing federal charges long ago.
Should the Miami U.S. Attorney’s Office have taken its chance on a federal prosecution of Epstein? Perhaps. But the fact that it took federal authorities almost 15 years to build a prosecutable case against Epstein would seem to support Acosta’s assertion that, in 2008, the case was not winnable. To put it another way: If the case could have been pursued earlier, why didn’t the Obama Department of Justice bring charges?
We should thank Acosta for securing a conviction of this vile man and ensuring that he registered as a sex offender over a decade ago. It was the actions of the Miami U.S. Attorney’s Office that led to the filing of civil lawsuits and prompted additional victims to come forward.
This week, the Trump administration did file federal charges against Epstein. So why aren’t the Democrats praising the administration for doing so? In the end, it all boils down to election year politics. Rather than give the administration credit, they find a way to place blame. Even more hypocritically, they ignore the fact that New York’s Democratic District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. inexplicably tried to have Epstein’s sex offender status overturned in 2011.
Sadly, Republican politicians haven’t behaved much better. So afraid are they of being branded “soft” on sex crimes that they won’t stand up for a good man who did what he could to protect the public from the likes of Jeffrey Epstein.
Shame on them.

Harvard economist suspended after probe

Texto completo: Harvard University is suspending a noted economist and shutting down his lab after a university investigation found that he allegedly engaged in unwelcome sexual conduct that created a hostile work environment.
Roland Fryer Jr. - a professor of economics, the founding director of the Education Innovation Laboratory known as EdLabs and a recipient of a MacArthur "genius" Fellowship - will be placed on unpaid administrative leave for two years, according to university officials.
It was the latest case of an academic star being held accountable in the wake of the #MeToo movement that has pushed back against sexual misconduct. Earlier this year, Harvard announced sanctions against retired professor Jorge I. Domínguez after an investigation found he had engaged in unwelcome sexual conduct spanning decades.
Claudine Gay, dean of Harvard's Faculty of Arts and Sciences, sent an email Wednesday to members of Harvard's Economics Department explaining that a review of allegations against Fryer concluded that his behavior created a hostile work environment over several years. The review also found alleged behavior that was not sexual harassment but violated the school's professional conduct policy.
"In short, Professor Fryer exhibited a pattern of behavior that failed to meet expectations of conduct within our community and was harmful to the well-being of its members," Gay wrote. "I was particularly upset to learn of the ways in which EdLabs members have been impacted, both personally and professionally."
Gay alleged that Fryer's behavior was a violation of institutional norms and a betrayal of trust.
Fryer will be put on administrative leave for two years, Gay wrote, during which time he will not teach or conduct research with Harvard resources. EdLabs will be closed. After he returns, Fryer will face significant restrictions, such as not having supervisory roles, not being allowed to teach graduate workshops and having his undergraduate teaching monitored by a person trained in rules governing Title IX, the federal law that prohibits sex discrimination in schools that receive federal funding.
After two years of such restrictions, Gay wrote, she will decide whether to restore Fryer's full privileges.
The decision came after Gay convened a committee of six tenured faculty members to recommend steps to be taken in light of the findings, Harvard spokeswoman Rachael Dane wrote in an email Wednesday. "She also took into account the results of a financial review of EdLabs that had been prompted by allegations of financial mismanagement," Dane said.
Reached by phone Wednesday, Fryer deferred questions to a spokesman.
In a letter to the New York Times in December, Fryer wrote that EdLabs "has always been a collegial and at times irreverent place. Lab employees, male and female, have on occasion made off-color jokes and commented on one another's lives outside of work, including their dating lives. As the faculty director of the lab, I allowed, encouraged and participated in this atmosphere. In that, I was wrong." He apologized to anyone who worked there and may have felt alienated or offended.
The Harvard Crimson first reported about the investigation.
Fryer is a recipient of the John Bates Clark Medal, given by the American Economic Association to the American economist younger than 40 judged to have made the most significant contribution to the field. According to his website at Harvard, he was the youngest African American faculty member to receive tenure at the school; it was granted when he was 30 years old.

Steyer's wealth may put him at odds with Democratic Party's direction

Texto completo: Democrats running for president in 2020 are agitating against the concentration of wealth in the hands of a few and decrying their influence on the political process. Now, they need to make room for one of those hyper-rich people in their own ranks.
Tom Steyer, the hedge fund billionaire and second-most-prolific political donor of all time, made it official Tuesday: He is jumping into the race for the Democratic presidential nomination.
Steyer will have to overcome more than a late start. In his four-minute announcement video, he decried a broken government that represents corporate interests and those of the hyper-wealthy rather than everyday Americans.
But to push his message that he is the right leader to get big money out of politics, Steyer will be leaning on more of his own big money. He has pledged to spend up to $100 million of his personal fortune on the race.
A couple of his rivals for the nod seized on that fact. In an appearance on MSNBC, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said he likes Steyer personally but he's getting "a bit tired of billionaires trying to buy political power." Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) drew a contrast between Steyer's plan to self-fund and her own $19 million second-quarter fundraising haul drawn from a grass-roots network: "The Democratic primary should not be decided by billionaires, whether they're funding Super PACs or funding themselves," she tweeted.
Steyer, 62, cut his teeth on Wall Street, working under future Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin on Goldman Sachs's risk arbitrage desk. But he amassed his estimated $1.6 billion fortune at the helm of a hedge fund called Farallon Capital Management, which he founded in 1986. By the time Steyer gave up his ownership in late 2012, it had grown to one of the largest in the world, with about $20 billion under management. The firm profited from investments in every sector of the economy, including fossil fuels, maintaining stakes in BP, oil-and-gas giant Nexen, and mining companies, among others.
By Steyer's account, a percolating crisis of conscience over those holdings reached full boil during a mountain hike in the summer of 2012 with environmentalist Bill McKibben. Afterward, he decided to personally divest from "ecologically unsound" investments. That translated into dumping stakes in tar sands and coal, two of the dirtiest energy sources.
But he drew criticism for moving more slowly to divest from all fossil fuel interests. And the New York Times in 2014 found that "despite his highly public declaration, Mr. Steyer's divestment will do little to impede the coal-related projects his firm bankrolled, which will generate tens of millions of tons of carbon pollution for years, if not decades, to come. Over the past 15 years, Mr. Steyer's fund, Farallon Capital Management, has pumped hundreds of millions of dollars into companies that operate coal mines and coal-fired power plants from Indonesia to China."
Steyer's record since of putting his money where his mouth is may blunt charges of hypocrisy. His organization NextGen Climate Action has plowed about $234 million into boosting Democratic candidates over the past three election cycles - with about $209 million of that sum coming from Steyer's own pocket, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
The bigger problem he faces is whether Democratic voters will embrace a billionaire at a time when populist animus is energizing the base.
Michael Bloomberg - a fellow billionaire who has funded climate change activism and other progressive causes - surveyed the same landscape earlier this year and decided not to run for president. In a Bloomberg News editorial, Bloomberg said he concluded he could never win the Democratic primary because he would refuse to "change my views to match the polls."
That may distinguish Steyer from Bloomberg - and, to a lesser extent, Howard Schultz, the former Starbucks CEO who looks to have given up on a potential independent bid based on centrist aims. Bloomberg has been an outspoken critic of some Democratic candidates' proposals to increase taxes on the rich, comparing Warren's plan for a wealth tax to socialism, for example. Steyer has called for raising taxes on upper-income earners, though he hasn't gotten specific.
But Steyer could soon find himself in a box: Promote a more moderate economic program, and his rivals on the left will have an easy time lambasting him for seeking to protect his self-interest and that of his class; adopt the stridently liberal line, and the question arises why Steyer is better suited to carry that banner than candidates such as Warren or Sanders, who have detailed their plans and developed major grass-roots followings.
As The Washington Post's Dave Weigel noted Wednesday, last month's AP-NORC poll found just 26 percent of Democrats said they favored a candidate with experience running a business, while 73 percent said they preferred one with experience in public office. Yet Steyer is emphasizing his lack of experience in office. "I am an outsider from outside the system, and I've been doing this for 10 years," he told Weigel, referring to his activism. "I think the question here for every single person who's running is: Who can connect with Americans? Who can rewrite the electorate and get us organized? That is the question. You can't buy that."
Steyer is right that he can't buy voter support. But he's launching his bid by trying, spending nearly $1 million on a TV ad campaign in states with early primary contests.

Texto completo: A Republican Mississippi gubernatorial candidate refused to budge Wednesday on his decision to bar a reporter from shadowing his campaign because she is a woman.
Robert Foster, a current state representative, blocked Larrison Campbell of Mississippi Today from shadowing the campaign, citing the "Billy Graham Rule" which, as Foster explained, is meant "to avoid any situation that may evoke suspicion or compromise [his] marriage."
Tweet
Foster responded to a New York Times article about the ban with a tweet Wednesday evening that read, "I refuse to change my moral stance on any issue because it’s not popular among the radical left. My wife and the State of Mississippi deserve a governor who doesn’t compromise their beliefs, and I’m sticking to my guns."
Tweet
"I will not be intimidated into a corner of silence by a group of radical Socialists and Communists whose goal in life is to dismantle America," Foster also tweeted. "In fact, I’m looking forward to fighting their radical, left-wing agenda."
Prior to the New York Times article, Campbell published a piece about Foster's decision to prevent her from shadowing the campaign Tuesday.
It read in part, "Colton Robison, Foster’s campaign director, said a male colleague would need to accompany this reporter on an upcoming 15-hour campaign trip because they believed the optics of the candidate with a woman, even a working reporter, could be used in a smear campaign to insinuate an extramarital affair."Story URLPhoto Caption:Rep.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Maybe President Trump was right that we needed a "Salute to America" last week, because apparently some Americans have lost sight of the greatness of our country. Case in point: To mark Independence Day, The New York Times posted a video op-ed challenging what it called the "mythology" of American greatness. "America may once have been the greatest," the Times video declares, "but today, America, we're just OK."
The video is like a caricature of how conservatives think the left sees America — except it isn't a caricature; it's real. It's a straw man come to life. As evidence we're just OK, the video cites statistics showing that other developed countries, such as Luxembourg, Sweden and Norway, have lower poverty rates or better education and health care outcomes than America. And as for our democracy, the Times says, it's not that big a deal because "a lot of countries have freedoms."
Put aside for a moment all the misleading data the video uses to show America is not so great. The fact is, all the freedom and progress those other countries enjoy today would not be possible without the United States.
The reason that "a lot of countries have freedoms" today is because our Founding Fathers pioneered the principle of popular sovereignty, where governments answer to the people instead of the other way around. At the time of our founding, the rest of the world was ruled by monarchs. Our founders established the first country in human history that was built on an idea — the idea of human liberty.
For most of our history, American democracy was a global outlier. In 1938, on the eve of World War II, there were just 17 democracies. It was not until 1998 — just two decades ago — that there were more democracies than autocracies.
That dramatic explosion of freedom didn't just happen. It was the direct result of the rise of the United States as a global superpower. The U.S.-powered victory over Nazi tyranny in World War II and our triumph over Soviet tyranny in the Cold War defeated the hateful ideologies of fascism and communism, and unleashed a wave of freedom that has spread across the world. Today, 4.1 billion people live in democracies. (Of those who do not, four out of five live in China.)
The unprecedented expansion of liberty has produced unprecedented prosperity. Last September, the Brookings Institution reported that "for the first time since agriculture-based civilization began 10,000 years ago, the majority of humankind ... some 3.8 billion people, live in households with enough discretionary expenditure to be considered 'middle class' or 'rich.'"
None of that would be possible without the Pax Americana guaranteed by U.S. military. Americans liberated a continent, rebuilt much of it from the rubble of war with the Marshall Plan, and then stood watch on freedom's frontier and prevented a Soviet tank invasion across the Fulda Gap. And today, the only thing that stops North Korea from invading South Korea or China from invading Taiwan is American military might.
So, let's be clear: Every country that enjoys democratic governance today owes its birth of freedom to our Founding Fathers, and the continued existence of their democracy to the U.S. military.
Today, for all its flaws, America remains the freest, most innovative, most prosperous country in the history of the world. We invented the lightbulb and the iPhone. We put a man on the moon and a rover on Mars. We are a nation of unparalleled military power and unlimited opportunity. There's a reason we have a crisis on our southern border; millions want to come here so that they can share in the abundance of American prosperity.
The men and women who flew those fighters and bombers over the Mall last week make it all possible. They provide the critical foundation of peace and security upon which our freedom, and the freedom of all the world's democracies, is built. Maybe Luxembourg scores better on some measures, but no one is counting on Luxembourg to secure the peace of the world. Trump was right to shine a spotlight on our men and women in uniform and to remind those who have lost sight of it that the United States is not simply the greatest nation on Earth; we are indispensable. Without us, the world would be mired in the darkness of totalitarianism rather than the light of liberty.
That is better than "just OK."

Texto completo: Harvard University on Wednesday suspended the prominent economist Roland G. Fryer Jr. for two years without pay and shut down his education research laboratory after an investigation found he engaged in unwelcome sexual conduct with multiple women in the lab.
The punishment derails the career of a scholar who, at 30, became the youngest African-American to receive tenure at Harvard. Fryer was also awarded a MacArthur “genius" grant in 2011 and the John Bates Clark Medal in 2015, given by the American Economic Association to the best American economist under age 40.
Now 42, he had been among the highest-paid employees at Harvard, earning $618,027, according to the university's 2015 tax form, and his Education Innovation Laboratory, or EdLabs, had attracted funding from some of the biggest names in philanthropy, including the Broad, Pritzker, and Gates foundations.
His downfall came after multiple women alleged that Fryer discussed sex at work, sexualized female employees, and created a demeaning workplace at the lab for several years, according to an attorney representing a lab worker who filed a complaint. Fryer's suspension was announced at a time when the university, like other institutions, has been reckoning with the prevalence of sexual harassment in the #MeToo era.
In an e-mail to members of Harvard's economics department, Claudine Gay, dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, noted that a review by Harvard's Office for Dispute Resolution concluded that Fryer “engaged in unwelcome sexual conduct toward several individuals, resulting in the creation of a hostile work environment over the course of several years."
Harvard's action also took into account allegations of financial mismanagement at EdLabs.
“In short, Professor Fryer exhibited a pattern of behavior that failed to meet expectations of conduct within our community and was harmful to the well-being of its members," Gay wrote. “I was particularly upset to learn of the ways in which EdLabs members have been impacted, both personally and professionally. The totality of these behaviors is a clear violation of institutional norms and a betrayal of the trust of the FAS community."
When Fryer's two-year suspension is over, he will be barred from advising or supervisory roles, and will, at Gay's discretion, be allowed to teach undergraduate classes monitored by a Title IX-trained individual, without access to graduate teaching fellows, Gay wrote.
Fryer will also be allowed to teach graduate classes, but not graduate workshops. After Fryer completes two years working under those strictures, Gay will decide whether to restore Fryer's academic privileges, she wrote.
“I am deeply disappointed, particularly because the important and outstanding work of my colleagues in our economics research Lab has been forced to stop," Fryer said in a statement. “Harvard has spoken. In due course, I will as well."
George J. Leontire, a lawyer who has represented Fryer, released a statement saying: “Given the decision was rendered today, Professor Fryer intends to examine his options going forward."
The women who were harassed have not spoken publicly, and a lawyer for one of them did not respond to messages Wednesday.
The New York Times reported that one of the women was a former Fryer assistant who received a text message from the professor after work hours that read, “Ur lucky ur not here. I would either tackle, bite u or both."
Fryer told a Harvard investigator the message was a “same-race thing" with the assistant, who was black, according to the Times. But the woman said the comment was “not a thing that black people say to one another," the Times reported.
In a letter published in the Times in December, Fryer apologized for making “bad jokes," but denied retaliating against employees or fostering an environment where women felt alienated.
Fryer already had been barred in March 2018 from entering EdLabs, the research space devoted to closing the racial achievement gap, which he founded in 2008.
With the closure of the lab announced Wednesday, three full-time workers and one-part time employee will lose their jobs, according to a person affiliated with the lab. Harvard said they would be given a lengthy notice period and help finding other work.
Tanaya Devi, a former Fryer research assistant and fourth-year PhD student in economics at Harvard, said she was “stunned and disappointed" in the decision to suspend Fryer.
“Not only does it seem Draconian because it was based on off-color humor in the lab, but it also seems unjust that Dean Gay has decided to penalize his researchers," who will have to scrap the studies they had been conducting with Fryer, Devi said. She said she had been working on several papers with the professor that will now be canceled.
“I continue to say Professor Fryer did nothing wrong," Devi said.
Colby Bruno, senior counsel at the Victim Rights Law Center, which advocates for victims of sexual assault and harassment, argued that a suspension was not enough, and said Harvard should move to fire Fryer.
“Too many times in our society we are too lenient with people who ruin people's lives," Bruno said. “He created a hostile work environment, he sexually harassed a multitude of people, he does not deserve to be there."
As dean, Gay cannot fire Fryer. Only the Harvard Corporation, the university's board, has the authority to remove faculty for “grave misconduct or neglect of duty."
Asked why Harvard didn't terminate Fryer, Rachael Dane, a Harvard spokeswoman, said the university weighs multiple factors when deciding how to sanction professors, including fairness to the faculty member, a sense of proportionality, responsiveness to victims, and the prevention of inappropriate behavior in the future.
“The university believes that the sanctions in this case . . . appropriately take into account these factors," Dane said.
Fryer had been celebrated as a pioneering and fearless economist whose work examining the racial divide in education and other areas sometimes yielded contrarian conclusions.
In a widely noted 2016 study, he found no racial bias in police shootings, an outcome that, he told the Times, was “the most surprising result of my career."
In May, Harvard barred Jorge Dominguez, a onetime vice provost and noted Cuban scholar, from campus and off-campus events and stripped him of other privileges granted to retired faculty after a yearlong investigation found a pattern of sexual misconduct spanning four decades.
Several women had alleged that Dominguez grabbed their knees, pressed his crotch into them, and touched their buttocks when he hugged them.
In May, Harvard Law professor Ronald S. Sullivan Jr.lost his position as faculty dean of Winthrop House after a campus furor erupted over his planned defense of the accused rapist Harvey Weinstein.
Students have, over the past year, demanded an external review of how Harvard handles sexual harassment complaints, and the graduate students' union has called for stronger sexual harassment protections in its first contract negotiations with the university.
In May, Harvard president Lawrence Bacow said the university would conduct an outside review to consider what organizational characteristics or culture at Harvard discourage people from reporting misconduct and whether there are barriers to effectively dealing with allegations.

Texto completo: Bud Selig, a history buff, might be accused by critics of examining his 22 years as Major League Baseball commissioner through a soft-focus lens via his new book, "For the Good of the Game: The Inside Story of the Surprising and Dramatic Transformation of Major League Baseball," officially on sale Tuesday.
However, on MSNBC's "Morning Joe" on Tuesday, he said he wrote it to right "so many of what I called historical myths in certain areas."
"There are probably going to be some people unhappy (with the book), but one thing you learn as a commissioner, whatever you do somebody's going to be mad, so you get used to that after a while," the former Brewers owner told host Joe Scarborough.
Once such episode would be the so-called "Great Lakes Gang," Selig's coalition of now-former baseball executives that included the Cubs' Stanton Cook, the Braves' Bill Bartholomay, the Twins' Carl Pohlad and the Dodgers' Peter O'Malley, as well as current White Sox Chairman Jerry Reinsdorf. Together they led the "coup" against Fay Vincent, who resigned as commissioner in 1992.
Some East Coast media, perhaps a few acting as mouthpieces for baseball executives and other insiders, were particularly leery of the relationship between Selig and Reinsdorf. The accusation: that Selig, who became acting commissioner in 1992 and officially took over as commissioner in '98, was taking his marching orders from Reinsdorf.
In 1994, Tribune baseball columnist Jerome Holtzman noted, "The New York Times quoted an anonymous NL owner as saying the 'Great Lakes Gang' is running the game. ... What seems to anger the Gotham scribes is that they can't seem to understand that baseball can survive without a commissioner sitting on Park Avenue."
In 1996, a year after it took a court ruling to suspend the labor standoff between players and owners (and internally, owners were squabbling over revenue sharing, which affected their labor stance), Reinsdorf lavished Albert Belle with a five-year, $55 million contract.
Then-Baltimore Sun columnist Ken Rosenthal blasted the deal as proof that Selig was Reinsdorf's "lap dog."
Rosenthal added: "Selig, derided as a 'small-town schlepper' by previous Commissioner Fay Vincent, couldn't possibly hold his own with a big-city shark like Reinsdorf. Yet, those two fancied themselves the Roosevelt and Churchill of baseball."
In his book, Selig addresses the notion that he carried Reinsdorf's water and lays much of the blame at the feet of former nemeses Donald Fehr and Gene Orza, the players' top negotiators.
"In my early years in charge, there was this widely held perception that Jerry was very influential, even that he was controlling baseball through me," Selig writes. "That was a bunch of garbage, and I can tell you exactly where it came from. It came from the union.
"Don Fehr and Gene Orza talked to writers all the time, a few in particular, and I always suspected this was an idea they were selling. That something nefarious was going on in ownership because of Selig and Reinsdorf. That was the way they worked, Orza especially. Anything they could do to cause a breach among owners, they tried.
"Jerry and I were indeed close. We still are. Jerry and I were never in lockstep, but in the beginning we agreed about the major issues. We knew this archaic economic system needed to be changed. He knew early on that we needed to change a lot of things. We had several disagreements, but I always knew where he was coming from. We worked together, but we did it my way."
Reinsdorf made similar comments to the Tribune in 1993, relaying an explanation from a couple of friends who were agents.
"They both said to me, 'It's part of a plan to drive a wedge between you and Selig. Everybody knows Selig is the guy. But if they can get Selig to think that you're acting like you're the most powerful guy, it'll drive a wedge between the two of you, and that'll really help them during the negotiations,' " Reinsdorf said.
Several times in the book, Selig credits Reinsdorf as being an ally on various baseball issues.

Texto completo: Headnote Rhythym and melody every where in majority-Black city
For the first time in six months, I would have to rely on memory alone: No cameras allowed. In my packed section of male spectators (women were at the other end of the room), there wouldn't have been enough space to lift my camera to my face even if I'd been allowed.
The pattering of long cylindrical atabaque drums, a sound like rainfall with occasional syncopated claps of thunder, bounced off the room's white walls. Over a floor strewn with leaves, women dressed in billowing white dresses danced in circles while answering every sung call from the lead drummer.
Occasionally, a dancer would fall into a trance, body shaking, head rolled back until another woman would approach her, rub her back and whisper words that would bring her back to this plane.
Over the course of the night, I watched as practitioners of Candomblé, a religion originating with the enslaved Africans brought to Brazil hundreds of years ago, paid their respects to Oxéssi, one of the pantheon of orixés that form a link between this world and that of the divine. For 4é hours, the music barely stopped.
The drums and singing were still going as I walked away from the house and down an alleyway in Salvador's neighborhood of Federaééo.
The event was a rare opportunity for outsiders like me to witness the rites of Candomblé, a faith, which like its sister religion in Cuba, Santeria, has a long history of secrecy and resistance, having survived generations of Catholic colonialists.
These public ceremonies are held at the Terreiro do Gantois every month, but they are not marketed to tourists. A friend of a friend told me where to go and when. It was telling that the spectators were largely Brazilian and it was indicative of how overwhelming Salvador can appear, but how, once you find your way in, the rewards can be intoxicating.
Salvador, the capital of the Brazilian state of Bahia, is home to more than 2.5 million people and is one of the largest Black-majority cities outside of Africa.
Its streets, a result of very little city planning, loop and wind between neighborhoods spread into two main sections, the Cidade Baixa (or "low city"), which hugs the coastline, and the Cidade Alta (or "high city"), where the Portuguese set up Brazil's first capital in 1549.
The city is the picture of faded colonial grandeur: colorful facades appear desaturated by time and sunshine, and tangled telephone wires run over sloping cobblestone streets. Even with the threat of occasional winter downpours, the city's beaches are packed, where vendors sell sticks of cheese that they roast over coals and sprinkle generously with oregano. For a handful of reais, someone will set you up with chairs and an umbrella and bring you cold beer and grilled seafood until you tell them to stop.
Warnings about crime
But the city isn't without its problems. Brazil is consistently rated among the most unequal countries in the world, and that wealth disparity can lead some to desperation. Danger, in the form of petty theft and muggings, seemed to be on many people's minds and it was often tough to tell which warnings warranted my attention and which were clouded by paranoia, classism or racism.
In Pelourinho, the historical center that is wrapping up a multiyear facelift, police patrolled the tourist-friendly stretch packed with caipirinha stands and souvenir shops. But I was repeatedly told not to venture even a few streets over.
Finding the beat
When my partner Maggie and I decided to follow the music, Salvador opened up. Rhythm and melody are everywhere. In Pelourinho, bloco-afros, or percussion crews that often double as community service organizations, rehearsed samba reggae rhythms in the streets.
Tuesday night brought out a particularly joyous crowd for the weekly show put on by Olodum, the bloco made famous through collaborations with the likes of Michael Jackson. Roadside shops blared forré, a propulsive musical style, through overworked speakers in attempts to drown each other out.
The perpetual party was even more energized than usual because the city was playing host to the Copa America, the South American soccer tournament, and the Dia de Séo Joéo (Day of St. John), which passes in other parts of Brazil with barely a blink but is a major event in the northeast of the country, was approaching
At the Teatro Castro Alves, the Bahia Symphony Orchestra went full Casual Friday, decked out in plaid and jeans, and churned out forré classics in celebration of Séo Joéo. By the encore, everyone had left their seats and Maggie and I found ourselves twirling with strangers.
Other things I loved in Salvador:
* Stands selling beiju, a kind of crepe made from tapioca, are everywhere in Salvador and it is baffling to me that the streets of New York and Los Angeles aren't filled with hip food trucks hawking the stuff. A thin layer of tapioca is covered in a choice of fillings, savory and sweet, and folded in half like a taco. try one filled with carne-de-sol, a salted and sun-cured beef, for starters. Addiction guaranteed.
* Salvador's beaches are world-famous for a reason, but you don't get the full picture unless you visit more than one. Start with the easily accessible Praia do Porto da Barra, which faces the Bay of All Saints and is one of the best spots in the city to take in the sunset, and, just around the bend, the Praia do Farol da Barra. At both, you'll find a mix of more well-to-do locals and tourists. For something completely different head out to Itapué on a Sunday to see a beach packed to the brim with extended families enjoying a day off.
* Everyone has an opinion on where to get the best moqueca, the signature palm oil-based stew famous in Salvador. The best I had was at Casa de Tereza, a spot tucked away in a corner of Rio Vermelho. It's a modernized version of the dish to be sure, but it undeniably hits the spot.
In so many parts of the world, culture rooted in Black communities has at one point or another faced attempts at whitewashing: Just look at all the buttoned-up white jazz ensembles that emerged across the United States in the early 20th century. It was refreshing to see so much of the Afro-Brazilian culture in Salvador still intimately connected to the city's Black community, despite (or perhaps because of) generations of collective trauma.
In the historical center, where a slave auction once stood, today a group of Black capoeira acrobats and musicians set up every day and put on a show. The food of the city, like moqueca, feels like it was lifted straight from West Africa - because it was.
One afternoon, I sat on a plastic stool on the side of the road and ordered acarajé, black-eyed peas deep fried into a mash and stuffed with tiny shrimp, cashews and palm oil. Speaking in a purposefully clumsy Spanish I hoped would pass as Portuguese, I asked the woman the story of the dish. She looked at me confused and with a heavy "no duh" tone replied simply, "Africa."
As powerful and integral as Salvador's African heritage is, it's almost contradictory that outsiders like me still mostly discover it through the eyes of the white people it fascinated. Until that night in the Terreiro do Gantois, everything directly related to Candomble that I encountered had been through a white lens.
There were the stunning photographs by Pierre Verger, the French photographer for whom Bahia and its culture became an obsession, on display at the museum of photography, Espaéo Pierre Verger.
Novelist Jorge Amado's home has been turned into a museum and a hut tucked away in the house's garden tells the story of Amado's own respect for and fascination with the religion.
The highlight of the Afro-Brazilian Museum at the Federal University of Bahia is the room filled with floor-to-ceiling panels depicting the different orixés carved by the Argentinean-born artist known as Carybé.
To witness any of that culture firsthand is an immense privilege.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Maybe President Trump was right that we needed a "Salute to America" last week, because apparently some Americans have lost sight of the greatness of our country. Case in point: To mark Independence Day, The New York Times posted a video op-ed challenging what it called the "mythology" of American greatness. "America may once have been the greatest," the Times video declares, "but today, America, we're just OK."
The video is like a caricature of how conservatives think the left sees America -- except it isn't a caricature; it's real. It's a straw man come to life. As evidence we're just OK, the video cites statistics showing that other developed countries, such as Luxembourg, Sweden and Norway, have lower poverty rates or better education and health care outcomes than America. And as for our "kick-ass democracy," the Times says, it's not that big a deal because "a lot of countries have freedoms."
Put aside for a moment all the misleading data the video uses to show America is not so great. The fact is, all the freedom and progress those other countries enjoy today would not be possible without the United States.
The reason that "a lot of countries have freedoms" today is because our Founding Fathers pioneered the principle of popular sovereignty, where governments answer to the people instead of the other way around. At the time of our founding, the rest of the world was ruled by monarchs. Our founders established the first country in human history that was built on an idea -- the idea of human liberty.
For most of our history, American democracy was a global outlier. In 1938, on the eve of World War II, there were just 17 democracies. It was not until 1998 -- just two decades ago -- that there were more democracies than autocracies.
That dramatic explosion of freedom didn't just happen. It was the direct result of the rise of the United States as a global superpower. The U.S.-powered victory over Nazi tyranny in World War II and our triumph over Soviet tyranny in the Cold War defeated the hateful ideologies of fascism and communism, and unleashed a wave of freedom that has spread across the world. Today, 4.1 billion people live in democracies. (Of those who do not, four out of five live in China.)
The unprecedented expansion of liberty has produced unprecedented prosperity. Last September, the Brookings Institution reported that "for the first time since agriculture-based civilization began 10,000 years ago, the majority of humankind ... some 3.8 billion people, live in households with enough discretionary expenditure to be considered 'middle class' or 'rich.'"
None of that would be possible without the Pax Americana guaranteed by U.S. military. Americans liberated a continent, rebuilt much of it from the rubble of war with the Marshall Plan, and then stood watch on freedom's frontier and prevented a Soviet tank invasion across the Fulda Gap. And today, the only thing that stops North Korea from invading South Korea or China from invading Taiwan is American military might.
So, let's be clear: Every country that enjoys democratic governance today owes its birth of freedom to our Founding Fathers, and the continued existence of their democracy to the U.S. military.
Today, for all its flaws, America remains the freest, most innovative, most prosperous country in the history of the world. We invented the lightbulb and the iPhone. We put a man on the moon and a rover on Mars. We are a nation of unparalleled military power and unlimited opportunity. There's a reason we have a crisis on our southern border; millions want to come here so that they can share in the abundance of American prosperity.
The men and women who flew those fighters and bombers over the Mall last week make it all possible. They provide the critical foundation of peace and security upon which our freedom, and the freedom of all the world's democracies, is built. Maybe Luxembourg scores better on some measures, but no one is counting on Luxembourg to secure the peace of the world. Trump was right to shine a spotlight on our men and women in uniform and to remind those who have lost sight of it that the United States is not simply the greatest nation on Earth; we are indispensable. Without us, the world would be mired in the darkness of totalitarianism rather than the light of liberty.
That is better than "just OK."

Texto completo: The day after his dismal showing in the first Democratic debates, former Vice President Joe Biden said in Chicago: "Folks, the discussion in this race shouldn’t be about the past." He’s right, of course. American politics is always about the future. But Biden doesn’t take his own advice. The candidate and his surrogates seem obsessed with talking about his resume: 36 years in the Senate, eight years as Barack Obama’s vice president. The effect is to reinforce his advanced age — he’ll be 78 on Inauguration Day 2021 — and his disconnection from current trends and topics.
Even as a younger and more vigorous figure, Biden was a deeply flawed presidential candidate in 1988 and 2008. And all his weaknesses, aggravated by age, were on full display during the debate in Miami. A post-debate poll by CNN saw him dropping 10 points, from 32% to 22%, while two younger female senators, Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren, surged upward.
Here’s the huge and growing problem staring Democrats in the face: Biden might be a miscast messenger, but his political position as a pragmatic progressive gives the party its best chance of defeating Donald Trump. If the Democrats abandon the middle ground and veer too far to the left, they are doomed to four more years of Trump in the White House and a generation of conservative justices dominating the Supreme Court. The debates in Miami showed that’s exactly where the party is headed. On a range of issues from immigration and health care to tax rates and climate change, the loudest voices espoused policies far outside the American mainstream. Rick Tyler, a conservative Republican strategist, accurately summed up the main lesson coming out of the Democratic debates for The Washington Post: "They are not talking to the blue-collar workers that I understand that vote in Pennsylvania and Michigan. Are they seriously capable of choosing a nominee who is going to beat Donald Trump? Right now I have my doubts." The Wall Street Journal editorial page was even pithier when its editors wrote: "President Donald Trump is a lucky man."
Only 26% of Americans call themselves liberals. And their voting power is even less than that, because they tend to cluster in urban areas and coastal states. Trump’s base remains fervently loyal, but stuck at about 35% to 37%. His apparent strategy, maximizing the votes of his loyal followers while not reaching beyond his core support, makes little sense. But the Democrats seem determined to make the same mistake, rushing to extremes and abandoning the moderate middle. And their liberal base, about 1 in 4 voters, is even smaller than Trump’s tribe of true believers. As James Carville, a key architect of Bill Clinton’s 1992 victory, told The New York Times, "This is an election that Trump can’t win but Democrats can lose."
Democratic voters understand this. By 2 to 1, they told CNN that they prefer a candidate who can defeat Trump, as opposed to someone who shares their views on issues. And 43% still see Biden as their best hope for a victory — 30 points ahead of anybody else. But after Miami, the party faces many questions. Can Biden pull it together and reinvigorate his campaign? Is there another moderate who can effectively take up that banner? If the answer to both questions is no, the party is in deep trouble. And Trump is indeed a lucky man.

Texto completo: Texas billionaire Ross Perot, who died Tuesday at the age of 89, might be best remembered for his independent presidential runs. But perhaps less remembered is how he attracted a following to his nontraditional 1992 campaign before the days of the Internet.
Perot leaned heavily on television at every stage of his campaign and even bought 30-minute blocks of time for what were essentially political infomercials.
Except for the cash needed to buy the airtime, the commercials were low-budget, featuring Perot seated at a desk, speaking directly to the camera, and occasionally displaying cardboard charts. One series included an interviewer who quizzed Perot with friendly questions on his background.
“As with so many aspects of his campaign, Mr. Perot's 30-minute commercials seem to defy decades' worth of political experience," the New York Times wrote of Perot's infomercials at the time, as it reported that 16.5 million people tuned in for the first program in October 1992.

A gray area between politics and the judiciary

Texto completo: James P. Donohue is a former U.S. magistrate judge.
"We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges," Supreme Court Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said in a statement issued in November, countering a reference by President Trump to an "Obama judge."
In my experience, federal judges work diligently to keep their personal views out of the judicial process. They would be appalled by the thought that simply noting the president who appointed them is all the public needs to know about what went into a decision. Yet, as much as Roberts and others on the federal bench bemoan attempts to reduce the judiciary to just another political institution, some judges have themselves contributed to the problem.
They have done so as members of the Federalist Society, a network of conservative and libertarian lawyers and legal scholars - it claims 60,000 members - that calls itself a nonpartisan educational organization but increasingly appears to be a political operation in all but name.
That much was made clear by a Post investigation in May that showed the intertwined interests of Federalist Society Executive Vice President Leonard Leo and a network of nonprofits dedicated to drumming up support among the public and politicians for the appointment of conservative judges.
Leo told The Post that he is careful to avoid conflicts between the educational work of the Federalist Society and the nonprofit's advocacy, but the inescapable takeaway from The Post's investigation is that the organization operates in such a gray area that no judge should be a member of the Federalist Society or participate in its activities.
Yet in the first year of the Trump administration, as the Hill noted, "Of the 13 judicial nominees confirmed since President Trump took office, 10 are either current or former Federalist Society members or regular speakers at its events. Eight of the 10 appellate Trump nominees pending before the Senate have ties to the group."
The Federalist Society has also advised the president regarding potential Supreme Court nominees, according to the New York Times. (The society says it does not advocate for individual judicial nominees.) In January, a Washington Post Magazine article about the Federalist Society reported that four members of the court, in addition to Roberts, are either former members or were closely associated with the organization: Samuel A. Alito Jr., Neil M. Gorsuch, Brett M. Kavanaugh and Clarence Thomas.
For anyone concerned about the unseemly mingling of politics and the judiciary, a little-noticed formal ethics opinion issued in February by the committee responsible for the Code of Conduct for United States Judges may offer hope.
Judges are bound by the Code of Conduct, which comprises five canons and associated formal opinions issued by the committee, which provide ethical guidance. Substantial speech and associational restrictions are imposed on active judges to preserve the judiciary's independence and integrity.
The restrictions are known requirements for people wishing to serve as judges and are accepted, perhaps begrudgingly, by those who serve. The rules exist because deference to the judgment and rulings of courts depends on public confidence in the integrity and independence of judges.
For many years, the Code of Conduct committee ducked the issue of judicial participation in the Federalist Society, in part, it seemed, because many powerful judges (see above) either have been or are associated with the organization.
The committee now appears to have drawn a line with its issuance of advisory opinion No. 116 expanding the scope of prohibited political activity. The Federalist Society is not mentioned by name, but the opinion is directed to the propriety of participation by judges in programs or membership in groups engaged in public-policy debates.
The prohibited political activities include those involving "hot-button issues in current political campaigns" or that are "politically-oriented" or have "political overtones." Public perception also plays a vital role, as the opinion bars judges from participation that would "give rise to an appearance of engaging in political activity" or "would otherwise give the appearance of impropriety."
The committee also warned judges that they should stay away from groups "where the funding sources are unknown or likely to be from sources engaged in litigation or political advocacy." The New York Times noted of the Federalist Society's 2015 annual report, the organization "discloses who contributes most of its money. But it also takes anonymous contributions, from players including the Mercer family, which was a major backer of Donald Trump." The annual report listed 14 anonymous donors on the "platinum" level - those giving $100,000 or more.
In the past, the Federalist Society's assertion of nonpartisanship has provided cover for conservative judges who wish to join an organization whose executive vice president, as The Post noted, is a "maestro" of the "modern machinery of political persuasion." The Code of Conduct committee's latest opinion should force a reconsideration.
The expanded definition of prohibited political activity does not endanger the Federalist Society , nor its ability to function as a conduit of conservative ideology for lawyers and academia. It simply makes the continued participation of judges in the organization indefensible.

COURTS GRAPPLE WITH AMAZON'S LIABILITY FOR DANGEROUS PRODUCTS

Texto completo: A tragic accident and a faulty rhinestone dog collar are at the center of a court drama that could have far-reaching effects on how products are sold online.
In 2015, Heather Oberdorf took her dog for a walk outside her Pennsylvania home, attaching a retractable leash to a collar she bought from Amazon seller The Furry Gang. The collar broke when her dog lunged, and the leash snapped back, permanently blinding her in one eye, according to the complaint she filed in 2016.
In the first significant decision of its kind, a Pennsylvania appeals court ruled lastweek that Amazon can be held liable for selling the defective product the same way a brick-and-mortar store would be, despite the company's claim that it is only serving as a platform to connect buyers to third-party companies like The Furry Gang.
The decision is a significant departure from the outcomes of other recent court battles. Within the past three months, two other federal courts have ruled the opposite: that, despite taking a cut ofthird-party sales, Amazon can't be held responsible for damage caused by the products sold in its third-party "marketplace."
State and federal courts have rejected lawsuits against Amazon over everything from deadly supplements to exploding hoverboards for the same reason. The decision in the dog-leash case could change that.
"This case has potential to open the courthouse and allow these cases to finally get before a jury and Amazon's business practices to be out in the open," said Brian Balser, the attorney for the family of 18-year-old Logan Stiner, who died after ingesting a fatal amount of pure caffeine a friend had bought from a marketplace seller. In February, a federal appeals court in Ohio ruled that Amazon couldn't be held liable for his death.
If you've ever shopped on Amazon.com or Walmart.com, there's a good chance you've bought something from their "marketplaces." More than half of the products purchased on Amazon are sold by independent stores through the internet giant's website.
Many customers shopping on Amazon don't realize when they're buying "marketplace" products. Amazon's third-party listings have a small "sold by" tag, and third-party listings on Walmart have a label that says "sold and shipped by." Both sites often list them under "other sellers" on a product page.
In Wednesday's decision, Judge Jane Richards Roth wrote that by serving as the only way customers and sellers could contact each other, Amazon's platform "enables third-party vendors to conceal themselves from the customer, leaving customers injured by defective products with no direct recourse to the third-party vendor."
It can be incredibly difficult to find out who owns stores on Amazon. Last year, a New York Times investigation found 141 Amazon sellers tied to an LLC using the same address in San Francisco. One of the stores listed its return address as the Palo Alto home of a family that had no ties to the companies and that could not understand why they kept getting Amazon returns delivered to their house.
Neither Amazon nor Oberdorf was able to find anyone connected with The Furry Gang, the Amazon store that sold the leash. An Amazon spokesperson declined to comment about the case.
Amazon's Teflon coating in marketplace sales cases has been a thorn in the side of many groups seeking more corporate responsibility.
"We're trying to get Amazon to work like a bartender," who can be held responsible for overserving people who later drive drunk, said Scott Steinford, CEO of Trust Transparency Center, a market research and consulting firm for the dietary supplement industry, which has conducted several investigations into products sold on Amazon.
A few weeks ago, a judge in Alameda County Superior Court ruled that As You Sow, an activist group that pushes for corporate social responsibility, couldn't sue Amazon over skin whitening creams containing high levels of mercury being sold on the platform without the warnings about cancer risk required by California law. One cream sold through Amazon contained 38,000 times the level of mercury allowed by the FDA, according to As You Sow's complaint.
The judge in that case agreed with Amazon that the federal Communications Decency Act, intended to protect online platforms from defamation claims based on internet comments and blog posts, meant Amazon was not responsible for warning labels. Last week's decision in Pennsylvania agreed with that understanding of the law but argued the company can still be held liable for damages caused by defective products.
While the Pennsylvania ruling is based on state laws, many other states, including California, use the same basic legal theory when deciding who counts as a seller, meaning the decision could have ramifications throughout the country.
"We need to decide, is this a store? I think the answer has to be yes. Amazon is our new store," said Danielle Fugere, president and general counsel of As You Sow. "We need laws that require a company like Amazon to undergo due diligence like a brick-and-mortar store would."
These questions will only become more important as more retailers, including Target, open their websites to third-party sellers.
"They take the position that it's the customer's responsibility to do due diligence on products in the marketplace. But if there's a problem with a product, it only comes out when it's used," Steinford said. "It may take a large number of bad reviews for it to be clear that a product is unsafe."
Amazon must now decide whether to appeal the Pennsylvania case. The court ruled 2-1 in favor of Oberdorf.
"We do not believe that Pennsylvania law shields a company from strict liability simply because it adheres to a business model that fails to prioritize consumer safety," Judge Roth wrote in the decision. "The dissent's reasoning would give an incentive to companies to design business models, like that of Amazon, that do nothing to protect consumers from defective products."

Resumen: Conditions for female journalists today have improved since the hostility in 1980s newsrooms. Nonetheless, there is still much progress to be made.

Texto completo: Our daughters wanted to know: “Were newsrooms really like that in the 1980s?”
They had binged on Season 3 of the Netflix hit “Stranger Things,” and they thought one of the strangest things of all was the way the all-male editors treated intern Nancy Wheeler.
As an earnest Wheeler flutters about the newsroom trying to fit in, the editors make sexist jokes, call her Nancy Drew, turn down her obviously good story suggestions and complain when a sandwich she delivers doesn’t have mustard on it.
Yes, women put up with a lot back in the 1980s. They still do.
Over the past two years, we have interviewed nearly 100 women who made it into leadership roles in newspapers, broadcast and digital news outlets since about the 1980s. Their stories are funny and sad and hair-raising — often at the same time.
Marcy McGinnis, who began as a secretary at CBS and rose to the No. 2 job in the news division, remembers a top executive lifting her up in the middle of the newsroom and twirling her around while proclaiming, “I’d like to thank the National Organization for Women for this trophy. ”
Nina Totenberg sat in a part of the NPR newsroom along with several other women that was widely referred to as the “fallopian jungle. ”
Women were told that they couldn’t work nights because it was too dangerous, and that they didn’t need a raise because they had husbands who worked. They were denied promotions because male staffers didn’t want to work for women. They were told how to dress and how to speak — and when to keep quiet. And above all, they were told they should never, ever cry in the newsroom.
To get ahead they felt like they had to — if not actually be a guy — act as much like one as possible. As late as 1998, Joyce Purnick, then the metro editor of The New York Times, told students at her alma mater, Barnard College, that she would have never made it to the city desk if she had children.
Women's issues in Washington: Trump administration neglect shows why we need permanent White House women's adviser
Today, only five of the 25 largest newspapers have women editors (Nicole Carroll at USA TODAY is one of them). Earlier this year, CBS named Susan Zirinsky as its top news executive, the first time a woman has ever held that job. News organizations that have never had a woman in charge include ABC News and CNN. The Washington Post has never had a woman as the top editor. The only woman to ever lead The New York Times was ousted publicly and unceremoniously after one of the shortest tenures in the newspaper’s history.
The situation isn’t much different in any traditionally male-dominated industry. Only 33 of the top 500 publicly traded companies are led by a woman.
But the problems extend well beyond who gets the corner office. A newspaper journalists’ union, NewsGuild-CWA, has been analyzing salaries at publications for several years and reports consistently finding disparities in pay between white men compared with women and people of color. A study last year by a union representing newsroom staffers at the Los Angeles Times found that the average male reporter made about $102,000 a year while the average female reporter made about $87,564.
And, of course, the news industry has had more than its share of #MeToo moments, with dozens of powerful men who once called the shots in news being called out for flagrant sexual harassment.
Those of us who entered media organizations in the 1970s and '80s didn’t expect things to be easy. We thought if we worked hard, ignored the slights, laughed off the sexual advances, stuck with it and brought other women up behind us, things would change. They did, but not nearly as much as we thought they would.
Equality now: Melinda Gates — Let's not take 208 years to achieve equality for women
In one poignant scene in “Stranger Things,” Nancy Wheeler has just been fired by those men who laughed at her, and she begins to question her worth. Her mother holds her and says, “It’s not easy out there. People are always saying, ‘You can’t; you shouldn’t; you’re not smart enough; you’re not good enough. ’ This world, it beats you up again and again until most people, they just stop trying. … But you’re not like that. You’re a fighter. ”
We tell our daughters and the many young women we teach that they, too, must be fighters. We tell them that they will face some of the same old battles, but that they belong in newsrooms. There’s a place for them. And maybe, just maybe, they can finish the job we started.

Texto completo: Leaked diplomatic cables published Sunday revealed unflattering comments from the British ambassador to the United States about the Trump administration, which he called "diplomatically clumsy and inept. "
Ambassador Kim Darroch's critical assessment was part of several documents from 2017 to the present, which The Mail said it was given in an "unprecedented leak" that it dubbed "The Washington Files. "
Some of the most inflammatory statements from Darroch came from a June 22, 2017, briefing note on the president and his team, which was prepared for top British officials, The Mail reported.
"For a man who has risen to the highest office on the planet, President Trump radiates insecurity," Darroch wrote in that memo.
"We don’t really believe this administration is going to become substantially more normal; less dysfunctional; less unpredictable; less faction riven; less diplomatically clumsy and inept," Darroch wrote.
A statement from the British Foreign Office did not dispute the documents' authenticity and said it did not believe the "mischievious behavior" would hurt diplomatic ties with the administration.
"The British public would expect our ambassadors to provide ministers with an honest, unvarnished assessment of the politics in their country. Their views are not necessarily the views of ministers or indeed the government," the statement said, according to The New York Times.
A spokesman for the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office later said that "a formal leak investigation" would be conducted, according to the Times and NBC News.
When asked about the leaked remarks, Trump told reporters that Darroch "has not served the U. K. well. "
In his 2017 briefing note, written a month after Robert Mueller was appointed special counsel to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 election, Darroch said he feared the "worst cannot be ruled out" about potential coordination between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin.
"There could have been active collusion between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and Russian intelligence, especially over the timing of release of hacked emails from inside the Clinton camp," he said. "Dodgy Russian financiers may have bailed out the Trump and Kushner enterprises when both were at risk of bankruptcy in previous decades. "
And, Darroch said, "Trump's attempts to close down the FBI investigation" into former national security adviser Michael Flynn "might amount to obstruction of justice. "
But despite the scandals swirling around the White House, Darroch said Trump could still win a second term and "emerge from the flames, battered but intact, like Schwarzenegger in the final scenes of The Terminator. "
More recently, in a June 22 cable from this year, Darroch called the administration's policy toward Iran "incoherent" and "chaotic" and said that he did not expect it to become "coherent any time soon," The Mail reported.
44% approval: Trump approval rating jumps to highest level of his presidency in Washington Post/ABC News poll
Darroch said he did not believe Trump's explanation that he aborted a planned military strike against Iran in retaliation for a downed unmanned drone because he was concerned about Iranian casualties.
"His claim, however, that he changed his mind because of 150 predicted casualties doesn't stand up; he would certainly have heard this figure in his initial briefing," Darroch wrote.
"It's more likely that he was never fully on board and that he was worried about how this apparent reversal of his 2016 campaign promises would look come 2020," Darroch said, apparently referring to Trump's pledge to avoid foreign entanglements.
On June 17, Darroch shared his views on Trump's recent diplomatic visit to the U. K.
"With this unorthodox President, there were genuine risks," he said. But he wrote that "the gamble" paid off.
According to The Mail, Darroch said that while Trump was "used to being feted by foreign governments," his visit with British royalty offered "an honour that no other country can match. He said Trump "revelled in every element of it" and "knew from the outset that it amounted to genuinely special treatment. "
Opinion: The real reason why the left was against Donald Trump's July 4 speech
Darroch also noted that it was critical that those around the president, whom he called the "Trump Whisperers," had a good time.
"His team were also dazzled, telling us that this had been a visit like no other – the hottest ticket of their careers," he said, according to The Mail. "These are close contacts, with whom we have spent years building relationships: they are the gatekeepers . . . the individuals we rely upon to ensure the UK voice is heard in the West Wing. "
But he cautioned that the visit's impact could be short-lived because, "This is still the land of America First. "
Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage said Sunday that the documents made it clear that Darroch was a "globalist" and "completely anti-Trump. "
"Some of these comments he's made go way beyond fair reporting," Farage said. "We're into the world here of opinion, clearly strongly biased opinion. And the sooner he's gone as the U. K. 's ambassador in Washington the better. "
Farage added that his assessment had nothing to do with Trump's 2016 tweet saying he thought Farage should be the ambassador to the U. S.

'Stranger Things' kids aren't kids anymore

Texto completo: We've been calling the young stars of "Stranger Things" "kids" for the past three years, but Does a "kid" become one of Time magazine's most influential people? Does a "kid" have millions of social media followers paying attention to their every post? Does a "kid" help shape their TV character? Going into Season 3, the goriest and perhaps best of the Netflix series, many of the show's 14-to-17-year-old lead actors – Millie Bobby Brown, Sadie Sink, Finn Wolfhard, Gaten Matarazzo, Caleb McLaughlin and Noah Schnapp – juggled much of the above while in real life becoming international celebrities, fashion plates and lightning rods for controversy. It's a lot of pressure for a kid to be under.
"We're definitely considered kids and always will be, since I started (on the show) when I was 14," says Sink, 17, by phone while getting her nails done for the show's premiere June 28. Sink, who plays Maxine, the new-to-town skateboarder and most recent "Stranger Things" friend group member, donned a custom Prada outfit for the event and has had a stylist since Season 2, when she joined the show.
Here's some of what the cast has had to contend with since the 2016 debut of "Stranger Things."
Social media stardom
Sink was quietly on Instagram for several years, but since she has starred on "Stranger Things," her follower count has grown to nearly 5 million.
"Once I had lots of followers, that was really intimidating," she says. "I didn't have too many followers before. Maybe a few Broadway fans." (Sink was on Broadway as an alternate for "Annie" in 2012, and starred in "The Audience" in 2015.) She preferred flying under the radar.
"I was definitely more into it (social media) before 'Stranger Things,'" she says, noting that sometimes she even gets nervous when middle-school-age girls want to take photos with her, because she prefers her anonymity.
"It's healthy to stay off (Instagram now)," says Sink, who deletes the app from her phone every now and then.
And it's easy to see why.
Fifteen-year-old Brown, aka show breakout Eleven and the aforementioned "influential" Time celebrity, has seen backlash after critics deemed her Instagram photos "too mature." (Her account has more than 19 million followers.) Brown had to shut down one of her Twitter accounts after she was falsely credited with saying offensive things and became the target of homophobic memes. (Brown is an outspoken LGBTQ advocate.)
Matarazzo, who plays science-loving nerd Dustin, faced his own social media headache after Netflix announced he would host "Prank Encounters," a show that pranks people on the first day of their jobs. After backlash, the teen posted an Instagram video to his 9 million followers to "clear up confusion" about his show, promising that the "over-the-top" pranks happened only for one-day jobs.
"I feel like the only reason I'm on social media now is because I was on social media before the show," Matarazzo says. "It's almost like a responsibility now."
McLaughlin, 17, who plays the slingshot pro Lucas (and Max's new boyfriend), has found being a celebrity has its pitfalls. "Not everything is good," he told People recently. "Some things are great. I think most of the things are great, but of course, the pressure and just being out there all the time – I'm just glad I have my parents to keep me grounded and be by my side when I'm stressed."
Acting their age
Matarazzo, 16, has been open about his rare disease, cleidocranial dysplasia, which is referenced on "Stranger Things" and affects the development of his bones and teeth, making him appear young and speak with a lisp.
But his co-stars say that in reality, the introspective star comes off much older.
"Gaten's really 45," his 27-year-old onscreen bestie Joe Keery (Steve) jokes.
Wolfhard, who plays group ringleader and Eleven's love interest Mike, jokes in his Twitter profile that he is "32 years young!" Really, he also is 16.
And when it comes to Brown, "she's so emotionally mature," says co-star Dacre Montgomery (Billy).
Fourteen-year-old Schnapp, who plays the monster-possessed Will, says their aging is getting obvious. "It's crazy now – like, Caleb has a beard. Everyone's tall. We've grown up so much," he told The New York Times.
On set, everyone is a pro
"When we first cast the show, we were auditioning hundreds of kids – and it was instantly clear to everyone that these kids were special," show creators Matt and Ross Duffer say by email. "They were all very authentic and unique – we felt we hadn't seen kids quite like this on TV before."
Many of the actors already had experience. Sink, McClaughlin and Matarazzo had been on Broadway. Brown appeared on TV shows including "Once Upon a Time in Wonderland" and "Intruders." Schnapp was in "Bridge of Spies" and voiced Charlie Brown in "The Peanuts Movie."
This season, though, "they've certainly become more confident," say the Duffers. "At this point, we trust them completely with their characters."
And they can speak up. When it came to Sink's character, she didn't like how Season 2 ended with a rivalry between the girls.
"I wanted to see that friendship between El and Max. I didn't want them to put the two girls against each other," says Sink, who's close friends with Brown in real life. In Season 3, the two characters become inseparable, supportive pals.
On set, the young actors were encouraged to go beyond the script.
Maya Hawke (Robin) says Matazzaro and Keery were "amazing improvisers," riffing about being allergic to Tic Tacs, getting punched in the face and learning life lessons in an ice cream shop – some of which made it into the final cut.
The off-the-cuff banter "resulted in some of the season's funniest exchanges," the Duffers say.
And other projects are calling
Outside "Stranger Things," the young stars are continuing to act in major projects. Brown is starring in the "Godzilla" franchise, and Wolfhard is a lead in the "It" movies.
Matarazzo is set to voice a camel in the animated film "Hump" and plans to return to the stage soon. "I don't see how I could be any more satisfied than I am right now as an actor," he says.

Cannabis tourism: High hopes for vacation

Texto completo: Sam Rosenbaum has Stephen Colbert to thank for his career switch from accountant to cannabis tour operator.
The newly minted MBA was watching an episode of "The Colbert Report" in 2014 when the comedian spoke of a "cannabis green rush" coming to Colorado, which had recently become the first state to legalize recreational marijuana.
"The part about bus tours kind of jumped out at me," Rosenbaum, 34, said. "I came up with High 5 Tours and registered it the next week." It was a prescient move. One year later, when Rosenbaum's home state of Oregon voted to legalize cannabis, High 5 Tours was the state's first cannabis bus tour.
Rosenbaum is not alone in his attempts in growing the world of cannabis tourism.
Eleven states in the United States so far have voted to allow people 21 and older to buy regulated amounts of cannabis product for consumption on private property. Sales systems are not yet in place in Michigan and Maine, and in Massachusetts a gradual licensing of dispensaries began in November. In Vermont, as in Washington, D.C., possession, growing and sharing cannabis are legal, but not buying or selling.
But in six other states - Alaska, California, Colorado, Nevada, Oregon and Washington - business is booming at cannabis dispensaries and related businesses.
As for cannabis tourism, it is hot in Colorado and California and emerging in others. Travel entrepreneurs like Rosenbaum are organizing marijuana-infused experiences, including painting classes, bus tours and food classes.
In the Mile-High City
The pioneers of cannabis tourism, Colorado Cannabis Tours and My 420 Tours, are in Denver.
The Original Colorado Cannabis Tour includes visits to two dispensaries, after which onboard consumption of purchases is encouraged. Visits to a growing facility and a glasspipe blowing demonstration found out the $89 bus tour, which lasts precisely four hours and 20 minutes.
Colorado Cannabis Tours is also behind the Puff, Pass & Paint class. Mike Eymer, the company's chief executive, teamed up with artist Heidi Keyes to create the first class in 2015. For $49, the tour includes teacher guidance and art supplies, including a canvas to take home. Cannabis is BYOC. The concept has since spread to other states.
"There are really some amazing paintings that come out of it," Keyes said. "With smoking, you're able to concentrate better. The colors are more vibrant and people are more willing to think outside the box."
My 420 Tours offers the Blaze & Gaze Graffiti Walking Tour ($29), a post-consumption 2�-mile walking tour of Denver's RiNo Art District, and the Sushi & Joint Rolling Class ($79). "It's our plan to copy and paste this model across the country," said Danny Schaefer, the chief executive of My 420 Tours.
Heavy on the Regulations
California has also rolled out the green carpet fer tourists. West Coast Cannabis Tours, in San Diego, offers various tours and classes, including an exclusive tour of a 32,000-square-foot growing facility ($99). Todd Green, who started the company when only medical marijuana was legal, said, "Now that it's recreational, people are coming out of the woodwork."
But regulations abound, especially for bus tours. In Colorado, Oregon and California, passengers on tour buses are allowed to consume what they have just purchased at cannabis dispensaries, which is almost every tour's first stop.
However, in Washington and Nevada, laws prohibiting smoking in moving vehicles limit operators to tours that are strictly educational. Seattle Kush Tours, for example, offers a 3�-hour tour for $99 that informs passengers about the new industry through stops at a dispensary, a growing site and a glass-pipe blowing demonstration. State law also prohibits the use of cannabis in a Seattle cannabis cooking class. Hemp is the substitute.
In Las Vegas, Matthew Miner, chief executive of Herbology Tours, offers for $109 a daily three-hour Herbology 101 tour. Well-informed guides share literature and knowledge during stops at a dispensary, a kitchen where cannabis edibles are made, and even a cannabis art museum, Cannabition, which it says features the world's largest bong. "It's a really cool experience, within limitations, because we can't smoke at any lounges ... yet," he says.
West Hollywood, as well as some cities in the San Francisco Bay Area, have circumvented state restrictions by allowing cannabis social clubs or consumption lounges. Alaska will soon be the first state permitting consumption lounges attached to dispensaries. And in late May, Colorado's governor signed a bill allowing cannabis "hospitality spaces" at dispensaries and at BYOC clubs.
The lack of smoking lounges has been a frustrating issue for Mitchell Knottingham, who owns Juneau Cannabis Tours in Alaska but has yet to launch his first tour. Knottingham said he got involved in things early in order to be ready when lounge approval came around. That may happen as early as mid-July
And in Portland, Oregon, Rosenbaum's bright yellow High Five Tours bus takes off every day at 6 p.m. on a dispensary tour ($79) that includes stops at food carts and a brewery. Every Friday, following the tour of the Columbia River Gorge ($89), he treats his passengers to ice cream sandwiches. It's been more than two years since he worked as an accountant. He hasn't looked back.

Texto completo: When it comes to issues concerning race or civil rights, the Trump administration doesn't deserve the benefit of the doubt; it lost all credibility the moment then-candidate Donald Trump kicked off his campaign declaring that most Mexican immigrants were rapists and criminals - and saw his standing among fellow Republicans improve. Trump only got worse on the issue as President, which is why every person his administration tries to hire, in any capacity, who has a racist history should be heavily scrutinized.
Though I'm big on redemption and second chances, I think it unwise to give an already-corrupt administration a pass on something so important. That's why Democrats are right to oppose the hiring of Eric Blankenstein in the general counsel's office of the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
The New York Times reported on Monday that Blankenstein already had to resign from a position within the Trump administration, from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, when racist blog posts he wrote as a University of Virginia law student became more widely known. That a man with that background was the head of the supervision, enforcement and fair lending division - the arm of the bureau dedicated to stemming the tide against discrimination in lending - illustrates better than maybe anything else the contempt the Trump administration has for racial and other forms of equality. Unsurprisingly, during his tenure, Blankenstein quickly took steps to defang the bureau's anti-discrimination arm.
The administration's new attempt to keep Blankenstein onboard, in a different position, is a doubling down on that contempt, particularly because that new position is in the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Trump tapped the unqualified Dr. Ben Carson to lead HUD. HUD should be focused on helping the poor and vulnerable. But Trump has treated it as a place to send those who don't know how to level the economic and racial playing field, or don't much care to. That's why there's little mystery as to why the Trump administration for the past couple of years has been rolling back civil rights protections - because it perfectly aligns with the decades-long racist track record of Trump himself.
In a different context, I'd be willing to engage discussions about allowing people to move beyond a checkered past, even if it included racism. Just a few months ago, I thought the debate over whether Virginia's governor being photographed in blackface while he was in medical school decades ago should have derailed his political career was healthy. Only weeks ago, another heated race-based argument erupted after Harvard University rescinded its offer of admission to Kyle Kashuv, a teenage conservative gun rights activist, because of what he said when he was 16 years old. That, too, was part of a necessary racial reckoning in this country, one in which new, higher standards are being set. (Harvard also rescinded the invitations of a small group of students for similar reasons a couple of years earlier, but that decision did not create the same level of blowback as denying a conservative favorite.)
The issue will forever be with us, and that's likely why the Trump administration has tried to use the redemption card to blunt Democratic outrage over the Blankenstein hire. But Democrats should not relent.
Is Blankenstein so incredibly talented and uniquely indispensable that we should ignore that he hasn't even bothered to apologize for his use of the n-word and other views (only saying he had "regrets"), a failure that should be seen as highly problematic for a man who wants the responsibility to help rid the country of discrimination? I think not.
And it should be lost on no one that Trump is trying to hire a man like this even as his administration is under scrutiny, not only for the inhumane way it handles asylum seekers and others, but because a racist Facebook group of Border Patrols officials has been discovered. Racism is a feature, not a bug, of this administration. The attempt to rehire Blankenship is just a reminder of that truth. - (CNN)

Texto completo: Early education in high-risk urban areas is a complex and seemingly overwhelming challenge.
Often dubbed the "school to prison pipeline," kids in troubled classrooms with negative peer influences and little family support too often end up incarcerated or repeating the cycle of poverty.
Despite committed teachers and administrators, these problems are expansive with far too few resources to combat the challenges.
Typically when young kids get in trouble, they are sent to detention where they become isolated as their anger festers.
Being labeled a troublemaker and punished for their actions, they internalize a painful message: "You are a bad kid, can't be trusted, and must be punished."
These early experiences shape young minds, which can quickly spiral down a path of lawless behavior, disengagement, and deeply negative outcomes.
Yet one school in Baltimore has taken an innovative approach to breaking the cycle. Instead of sending kids to a bare room that resembles a holding cell, they're sent to learn yoga and meditation.
The innovative leaders at Fort Worth Elementary are replacing demoralizing punishment with coping skills, trying to lift kids up though education and empowerment. A professional yogi, Ramone Brown, was hired to lead the program and help elevate the students' young minds.
"I think it's created this overall sense of collective here in the school and unity," said Brown in an interview for internet media site NowThis. "When something happens, there's been harm in the village, right, and instead of tearing that child down and you know, isolating a child and excluding that child, you're bringing a child back in to let them know that they are loved and they are safe, that they made a mistake, and that they are able to fix it."
Kids now learn vital skills for coping, conflict resolution, and self-control rather than experiencing the equivalent of elementary school prison.
Solving big problems This innovative approach to solving a difficult problem is already paying big dividends, with repeat offenses dropping dramatically and a new sense of peace ensconcing this urban school.
We all face difficult challenges in our careers, companies, and communities. Instead of gravitating toward typical solutions, let's follow the lead of this innovative Baltimore school and explore unorthodox, non-traditional solutions.
Instead of complying with the past, we must invent a better future. We must look for fresh, new approaches if we really want to drive progress and improve conditions in our lives and businesses.
The folks at Forth Worth Elementary were able to pursue an innovative solution with extremely limited resources in a complex and difficult urban environment. Think what you can do with the resources at your disposal.
There are limitless approaches to solving difficult problems. It is time to push the boundaries and discover bold, new paths forward if we want to effectuate change, enjoy sustainable success, and yes ... change the world for the better.
Namaste.

Texto completo: ALPINE, Calif. - Charley Royer, 17 months old, has such a swift, strong kick that putting a pair of pants on him can turn into a wrestling match.
His mother doesn’t mind. Far from it.
“Things that might annoy other parents, I’m so thankful for,” Lexi Royer said.
This child, who crawls around the house chasing a Yorkie named Bruce and proudly hauls himself upright against the couch, wasn’t expected to do any of this. Before he was born, doctors predicted he would be paralyzed from the waist down. Prenatal testing had found that he had a severe spinal defect and might need breathing and feeding tubes, leg braces, crutches, a wheelchair and lifelong treatment for fluid buildup in his brain.
The condition, spina bifida, occurs when tissue that should enclose and protect the spinal column does not form properly, leaving part of the spine uncovered, with nerves exposed. About 2,000 children a year are born with the disorder in the United States.
Surgery to repair the defect can be performed after a child is born, but the results are often better if it can be accomplished before birth. Because nerve damage is irreversible and accumulates as a pregnancy progresses, closing the spine as early as possible can prevent further injury.
Experimental surgery
Traditionally, the prenatal surgery has required cutting open the uterus. But Lexi and her husband, Joshuwa, chose an experimental approach: fetoscopic surgery, developed at Texas Children’s Hospital by Dr. Michael A. Belfort, the obstetrician and gynecologist in chief, and Dr. William Whitehead, a pediatric neurosurgeon.
In that operation, described in an article in The New York Times, doctors opened the abdomen and made tiny slits in the uterus to insert a camera and miniature instruments. The camera sent images to a monitor so the surgeons could watch what they were doing.
The operation is not appropriate for every case of spina bifida, but, when feasible, it has two advantages. Not making a big cut in the uterus decreases the odds that the mother will give birth prematurely and need a cesarean. Surgeons at Stanford and Johns Hopkins are also performing fetoscopic surgery for spina bifida in clinical trials.
For the Royers, the experiment paid off. Charley had the surgery in September 2017, as a six-month fetus, and was born full term in January 2018. No cesarean was needed. Charley even flexed his legs in the delivery room.
Most important, the fetal surgery had quickly reversed a dangerous condition in which part of Charley’s brain stem had sunk into his spinal canal, which could have led to physical and cognitive disabilities.
“He’s on track with everything - speech, fine motor, cognitive - except for gross motor, which we expected,” Lexi Royer said.
Family help
He gets physical and occupational therapy every week, and Lexi Royer spends an hour a day working with him on walking. His father built parallel bars out of plastic pipe, and as Charley walks hanging on to those, his parents hand him toys to encourage him to hold the bar with just one hand. His legs were strong enough to bear his weight and let him stand at 6 months, Lexi Royer said. The first time he walked across a room, holding on to a walker with wheels, he finished by plopping down and yelling “Whoa!” Royer said. She wept.
Despite fetal surgery, many children with spina bifida are incontinent. But Charley, to the surprise of his doctors, has aced a series of complicated diagnostic tests, indicating that his bladder function is normal and he is likely to have urinary control.
“People ask me: ‘So he’s all good now? It’s over? He’s cured?’ ” Royer said.
No.
“Fetal surgery is not a cure,” she said. “Damage was done before the surgery, and all they can do is close it up so the damage doesn’t get worse. He’ll have to be monitored for the rest of his life. He’ll have this condition for the rest of his life. His outcome is great. But things could change.”
One concern is that scar tissue at the surgery site might grow into Charley’s spine and entangle nerves, a condition called tethered cord, which would require surgery. The first sign may be bladder or bowel trouble, or weakness in the legs. It is not uncommon in children with a history of spina bifida, and often occurs during growth spurts. The first incidence may be at age 5 or 6. It can happen more than once, and can require multiple operations.
Looking back at the fetal surgery, her subsequent months of pregnancy and Charley’s birth, Royer said: “It was a blur. You just do what you can do. At the time, you’re in fight or flight. Then there’s time to process when you get home. It was scary at first. You don’t know what to look for.”
Even though doctors reassured his parents that Charley was strong and that they should treat him like a normal baby, he seemed fragile to them. It made first-time parenthood even more stressful. Would riding in a car seat injure his spine? Was his crying normal fussiness, or something more serious? Might he have a bladder infection? Was fluid building up in his brain?
“It really took a toll that hit when he was about 6 months old,” Royer said. “I was overwhelmed, and so tired. I started having flashbacks to the diagnosis, and I would wake up crying. At the time, I just had to get through it. Then I was reliving it.”
The memory that haunted her was the day of the diagnosis, when a doctor pulled a medical textbook off a shelf and showed her and her husband tables with alarmingly high rates of paralysis and death.
She feared Charley would deteriorate.
“I always felt like it was an emergency situation,” she said. “We did everything we could to get him to this point, and we could miss something and unravel everything we did.”
Her husband is a firefighter, and the department has counselors who specialize in post-traumatic stress disorders, for both employees and their families. Lexi Royer sought counseling, and it helped, she said.
But now she and her husband are grappling with a new question: How will they tell Charley about his condition?
“I think about it all the time,” Joshuwa Royer said. “But I don’t want to bore him, or limit him, or create a disability in his mind. We don’t want this to be his identity. And we don’t want to pour into him what we went through.”
‘Choked me up’
As an emergency medical technician, Joshuwa Royer answered an ambulance call for an adult with spina bifida. It was a wrenching glimpse of what might have been. A shunt implanted to drain excess fluid from the man’s skull was failing; he was in a wheelchair. He had undergone more than 20 spine operations, had rods implanted in his back and needed a feeding tube because he could not swallow.
“It was an eye opener,” Royer said. “That really hit me, choked me up.”
The Royers live high in the foothills of a mountain range. Their home overlooks a canyon and distant peaks. The terrain is rough.
Joshuwa Royer looks forward to hiking with Charley, camping, building fires, fishing. “All the stuff I did as a boy,” he said. “I imagine him one day in the yard with me, teaching him stuff, working on stuff, being self-sufficient, fixing cars and stuff around the house.”
Lexi Royer is just grateful for her life with Charley now.
“I didn’t think it would be so positive, so happy,” she said. “Our days are just so normal. I wish I could have had a crystal ball then and seen how we are now. If I just could have known that everything was going to be OK. If I could have seen him sitting here, playing now. I could have saved myself so many tears.”

Mistakes put recycling in jeopardy

Texto completo: The future of recycling is in jeopardy, and it's not just because market changes are straining profits - it's because people don't know how to recycle.

In the industry, it's referred to as wish-cycling, or wishful recycling.

Environmental campaigns over the years have ingrained the message reduce, reuse, and recycle to save the planet, even leading to crusades against straws, plastic bags, and Styrofoam coolers. But now consumers are afraid to throw anything away, including garbage.

If an item has the recycle symbol stamped on the bottom or if it's made of plastic, people tend to put it in recycling, Paul Rasmusson, Toledo's public service director, said.

During a recent tour of a Republic Services facility in Oberlin, Ohio, which processes Toledo's recycling, the wish-cycling was evident, as was the rubbish: Styrofoam, a wig, clothing, a gas can, a helium tank, multiple garden hoses, a child size lawn chair, greasy pizza boxes, yard waste, a cupcake tin, LEGOs, and mounds of plastic bags.

Unintendedconsequences

The intention is good - to spare these items, especially chemical-filled plastics, from the landfill - but most processing centers, like Republic's, aren't equipped to handle plastics beyond the typical food, drink, and detergent container. Anything else contaminates the stream and has the opposite effect.

Materials not in Republic's processing program are rerouted to the landfill. Lingering liquids that coat other items send entire loads of good recyclables to the landfill. Recyclables collected together in plastic bags are sent where? The landfill.

If it's in a bag, we consider that trash, Dan Schoewe, Republic Services' operations manager, said. [People] are hoping we'll figure it out for them, but we don't have time for that. ... Know what to throw.

So while recycling is up - the latest Ohio EPA data showed Lucas County in 2017 had the highest percentage for residential recycling in the state at 52.75 percent - so is the percentage of trash.

Republic Services receives roughly 400 tons of recyclables from across northwest Ohio each day, about 100 tons of which comes from the Toledo area, Mr. Schoewe said. Of Toledo's portion, about 30 percent is trash.

All of that ends up in the landfill, and recycling centers have to pay to send it there. For Republic Services, the price of wishful recycling is $35 per ton, which means Toledo's error costs about $1,050 per day.

Couple that with the fact that contamination last year led China to stop taking American recycling, which triggered a global plunge in prices for paper, plastics, and other materials, and recycling has become too costly for some communities to continue.

Could the end ofrecycling be near?

Before that, mills were paying $50-$75 per ton for Republic's mixed paper, Mr. Schoewe said. Today, Republic pays the mills $5 per ton to take it, and they barely get anything for mixed plastics, he said.

As recycling centers began passing on some of those costs to communities, the math became simple: rising costs plus tanking market values equals no more recycling.

According to a recent report from the New York Times, cities in Tennessee, Florida, and Pennsylvania have suspended their recycling programs or are burning some of it instead.

Think it won't come to that locally? It might this year.

The city of Oregon's current contract with Waste Management is up this fall and, based on the market challenges and contamination concerns, city Administrator Michael Beazley said their $1 million recycling program could be on the chopping block.

We've made no changes in our recycling program in 10 years, but that doesn't mean we won't, Mr. Beazley said. There's a lot less recycling going on than we think there is.

Akron also dropped glass from its recycling program this year, saying it wasn't cost-effective to continue, and launched an education program in June to reduce its contamination.

Toledo isn't likely to take it that far.

Toledo violators will lose recycling bins

The recycling program hasn't generated revenue for the city in about 20 years, Mr. Rasmusson said and, even then, profits topped out at $400,000 in a good year. Today, it costs the city about $2 million each year in transportation and processing.

Though building the proposed $5 million to $7 million local materials-recovery facility could save Toledo about $800,000 in transportation costs, Mr. Rasmusson predicts the process will never be profitable again. The real reason to continue recycling, he said, is to save the city's landfill, otherwise Toledo will also have to pay to truck its refuse elsewhere.

There is a finite number of natural resources and materials in the world and, just because it's not economically viable to process them right now, doesn't mean we shouldn't, Mr. Rasmusson said. We'll never have another landfill in the city. By [recycling] right we can keep our costs as low as possible.

City agents have been inspecting residential recycling bins for violations. So far, they've only been issuing warnings to residents who place the wrong items in the blue bin, but if the behavior isn't corrected this year, the city will remove the bin and replace it with a second trash can.

Recycling in some cases costs more than throwing it away, Mr. Schoewe said.

So while it may sound contrary to the goal, When in doubt, throw it out.

Texto completo: CLINT, Texas — Since the Border Patrol opened its station in Clint, Texas, in 2013, it was a fixture in this West Texas farm town. Separated from the surrounding cotton fields and cattle pastures by a razor-wire fence, the station stood on the town’s main road, near a feed store, the Good News Apostolic Church and La Indita Tortillería. Most people around Clint had little idea of what went on inside. Agents came and went in pickup trucks; buses pulled into the gates with the occasional load of children apprehended at the border, four miles south.
But inside the secretive site that is suddenly on the front lines of the southwest border crisis, the men and women who work there were grappling with the stuff of nightmares.
Outbreaks of scabies, shingles and chickenpox were spreading among the hundreds of children who were being held in cramped cells, agents said. The stench of the children’s dirty clothing was so strong it spread to the agents’ own clothing — people in town would scrunch their noses when they left work. The children cried constantly. One girl seemed likely enough to try to kill herself that the agents made her sleep on a cot in front of them, so they could watch her as they were processing new arrivals.
“It gets to a point where you start to become a robot,” said a veteran Border Patrol agent who has worked at the Clint station since it was built. He described following orders to take beds away from children to make more space in holding cells, part of a daily routine that he said had become “heartbreaking.”
The little-known Border Patrol facility at Clint has suddenly become the public face of the chaos on America’s southern border, after immigration lawyers began reporting on the children they saw — some of them as young as 5 months old — and the filthy, overcrowded conditions in which they were being held.
Border Patrol leaders, including Aaron Hull, the outspoken chief patrol agent of the agency’s El Paso Sector, have disputed descriptions of degrading conditions inside Clint and other migrant detention sites around El Paso, claiming that their facilities were rigorously and humanely managed even after a spate of deaths of migrant children in federal custody.
But a review of the operations of the Clint station, near El Paso’s eastern edge, shows that the agency’s leadership knew for months that some children had no beds to sleep on, no way to clean themselves and sometimes went hungry. Its own agents had raised the alarm, and found themselves having to accommodate even more new arrivals.
The accounts of what happened at Clint and at nearby border facilities are based on dozens of interviews by the New York Times and the El Paso Times of current and former Border Patrol agents and supervisors; lawyers, lawmakers and aides who visited the facility; and an immigrant father whose children were held there. The review also included sworn statements from those who spent time at El Paso border facilities, inspection reports and accounts from neighbors in Clint.
The conditions at Clint represent a conundrum not just for local officials, but for Congress, where lawmakers spent weeks battling over the terms of a $4.6 billion humanitarian aid package for facilities at the border. The lack of federal investment, some argue, is why the sites have been so strained. But the reports of squalor prompted several Democratic lawmakers to vote against the final bill, which did not have oversight and enforcement provisions.
ABOUT THIS STORY
Accounts of what happened at Clint and at nearby border facilities are based on dozens of interviews by the New York Times and the El Paso Times of current and former Border Patrol agents and supervisors; lawyers, lawmakers and aides who visited the facility; and an immigrant father whose children were held there. The review also included sworn statements from those who spent time at El Paso border facilities, inspection reports and accounts from neighbors in Clint.
By all accounts, the Border Patrol’s attempt to continue making room for new children at Clint even as it was unable to find space to send them to better-equipped facilities was a source of concern for many people who worked there.
“I can’t tell you the number of times I would talk to agents and they would get teary-eyed,” said one agent, a veteran of 13 years with Border Patrol who worked at Clint.
Mary González, a Democratic state lawmaker who toured the Clint station last week, said that Border Patrol agents told her they had repeatedly warned their superiors about the overcrowded facility, but that federal officials had taken no action.
“They said, ‘We were ringing the alarms, we were ringing the alarms, and nobody was listening to us’ — agents told me that,” González said. “I genuinely believe that the higher-ups made the Clint situation happen.”
A Forward Operating Base
Architects designed the Clint station as a type of forward base — replete with fueling stations, garages for all-terrain vehicles and horse stables — from which agents could go on forays along the border.
The station was never intended to hold more than about a hundred adult men, and it was designed with the idea that migrants would be detained for only a few hours of processing before being transferred to other locations.
Officials have allowed reporters and members of Congress on controlled tours of Clint, but prohibited them from bringing phones or cameras inside, and from entering certain areas. But through interviews with dozens of people with knowledge of the station — including lawyers, former detainees and staff members — the New York Times was able to model the main areas where children were held: the station’s central processing area, with its cinder-block cells; a converted loading area and yard; and a warehouse on the property.
Parts of the site resemble what might be seen at many government buildings. Photographs in the hallway celebrate the work of the Border Patrol, showing agents on horseback and in all-terrain vehicles. A conference room features high-backed chairs upholstered with faux leather.
But the sense of normalcy fades away the deeper one goes into the station. A detachment of Coast Guard personnel, sent to assist overworked agents, stock an ad hoc pantry with items like oatmeal and instant noodles. Monitors in blue shirts roam the station, hired through an outside contractor to supervise the detained children.
Beyond the pantry, a door leads to the site’s processing center, equipped with about 10 cells. One day this month, about 20 girls were crowded into one cell, so packed that some were sprawled on the floor. Toddlers could be seen in some cells, cared for by older children.
One of the cells functioned as a quarantine unit or “flu cell” for children with contagious diseases; employees have at times worn medical masks and gloves to protect themselves.
A part of the processing area was set aside for detained children to make phone calls to family members. Many broke into tears upon hearing the voices of loved ones, episodes so common that some agents merely shrugged in response.
Clint is known for holding what agents call UACs, or unaccompanied alien children — children who cross the border alone or with relatives who are not their parents.
Three agents who work at Clint said they had seen unaccompanied children as young as 3 enter the facility, and lawyers who recently inspected the site as part of a lawsuit on migrant children’s rights said they saw children as young as 5 months old. An agent who has worked for Border Patrol for 13 years — and who, like others interviewed for this story, spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the situation — confirmed reports by immigration lawyers that agents have asked migrants who are teenagers to help care for the younger children.
“We have nine agents processing, two agents in charge of UAC care and we have little ones that need their diapers changed, and we can’t do that,” the agent said. “We can’t carry them or change diapers. We do ask the older juveniles, the 16-year-olds or 17-year-olds, to help us out with that.”
As immigration flows change, the scene inside Clint has shifted as well. The number of children in the site is thought to have peaked at more than 700 around April and May, and stood at nearly 250 two weeks ago. In an attempt to relieve crowding, agents took all the children out of Clint but then moved more than 100 back into the station just days later.
Unaccompanied boys are kept in a converted loading area that holds about 50 people. Until a few weeks ago, older boys were kept in a tent encampment outside.
Families, including adult parents, were also sent to Clint earlier this year, and Rep. Will Hurd, R-Texas, whose district includes Clint, said that 11 adult males “apprehended that morning” were also being held at the site when he visited on June 29.
Before the influx of migrants began to wane in recent weeks, the agents said they had kept the families in a warehouse normally used to house ATVs. It was converted into two holding areas initially intended to house 50 people each.
A Chief Agent Under Fire
At least two Border Patrol agents at Clint said they had expressed concern about the conditions in the station to their superiors months ago. Even before that, senior Homeland Security officials in Washington had significant concerns about the El Paso Sector’s brash chief patrol agent and his oversight of the facility over the past year, when tighter security along other sections of the border prompted a steep rise in migrant crossings along the section that runs from New Mexico through West Texas.
The situation became so severe that in January, officials at Customs and Border Protection, the agency that oversees the Border Patrol, took the unusual move of ordering the sector chief, Hull, to come to headquarters in Washington for a face-to-face meeting. The officials were concerned that Hull, an agency veteran who speaks with a pronounced Texas twang, had moved too slowly to put safety measures in place after the deaths of migrant children, according to a Homeland Security official. After the meeting, Hull moved forward with the new procedures.
But tension has persisted between Hull and officials in Washington, particularly in recent months, as the number of migrants continued to increase at his facilities. The officials believe that Hull and Matthew Harris, the chief of the Clint station, have been slow to follow directives and communicate developments at the facilities in their sector, according to two Homeland Security officials.
Hull is seen as a hard-liner on immigration issues. He has often been heard saying that migrants exaggerate the problems they face in their home countries.
Officials at the border agency declined multiple interview requests.
Last month, the acting head of CBP, John Sanders, ordered an internal investigation into the Clint facility. The investigation — which is being conducted by the agency’s Office of Professional Responsibility and the department’s inspector general — has examined allegations of misconduct.
As part of the review, investigators have conducted interviews and watched hours of video footage to see how agents treated detainees. So far, investigators have found little evidence to substantiate allegations of misconduct. But they have found that the facility is several times over capacity and has horrendous conditions.
The uproar over the site is drawing scrutiny on Border Patrol facilities that are some of the least-regulated migrant-detention centers in the United States.
That is in part because they are intended in most cases to hold migrants for no more than 72 hours, before they are turned over to better-equipped facilities operated by other government agencies with stricter regulations on, say, the number of toilets and showers required. But the 72-hour limit has been frequently breached during the current migrant surge; some children have been housed at Clint for weeks on end.
Lawyers who visited the Clint station described children in filthy clothes, often lacking diapers and with no access to toothbrushes, toothpaste or soap, prompting people around the country to donate supplies that the Border Patrol turned away.
But Hull painted a far different picture of his need for supplies in April, when the numbers of children held in Clint were soaring. Hull told commissioners in Doña Ana County in Las Cruces, New Mexico, in April that his stations had more than enough supplies.
“Twenty years ago, we were lucky if we had juice and crackers for those in custody,” Hull said, as quoted in The Las Cruces Sun-News. “Now, our stations are looking more like Walmarts — with diapers and baby formula and all kinds of things, like food and snacks, that we aren’t resourced or staffed for and don’t have the space to hold.”
An Inspector Arrives
One day in April, a man from Washington arrived unannounced around midday at the Clint station. He introduced himself as Henry Moak, and told the agents inside that he was there to inspect the site in his role as Customs and Border Protection’s chief accountability officer.
The Clint station was far over capacity on the day of Moak’s visit, bulging with 291 children. Moak found evidence of a lice infestation; children also told him about going hungry and being forced to sleep on the floors.
One girl, a 14-year-old from El Salvador, had been in custody for 14 days in Clint, including a nine-day stretch in a nearby hospital during which Border Patrol agents accompanied her and kept her under surveillance. Moak did not specify in his report why the girl had been rushed to the hospital. When the girl returned to Clint, another child had taken her bed so she had to sleep on the floor.
Two sisters from Honduras, one 11 and the other 7, told Moak that they had to sleep on benches in the facility’s hold room, getting their own cot only when other children were transferred out. “The sisters told me they had not showered or brushed their teeth since arriving at Clint station,” Moak said in his report. Showers had been offered twice during the girls’ time in custody, but the girls were asleep each time, his review showed.
Moak in the end stated that Clint was in compliance with standards.
One of a team of lawyers who inspected the station in June, Warren Binford, director of the clinical law program at Willamette University in Oregon, said that in all her years of visiting detention and shelter facilities, she had never encountered conditions so bad — 351 children crammed into what she described as a prisonlike environment.
She looked at the roster, and was shocked to see more than 100 very young children listed. “My God, these are babies, I realized. They are keeping babies here,” she recalled.
One teenage mother from El Salvador said Border Patrol agents at the border had taken her medicine for her infant son, who had a fever.
“Did they throw away anything else?” Binford said she had asked her.
“Everything,” she replied. “They threw away my baby’s diapers, formula, bottle, baby food and clothes. They threw away everything.”
Once at Clint, she told Binford, the baby’s fever came back and she begged the agents for more medicine. “Who told you to come to America with your baby, anyway?” one of the agents told her, according to the young woman’s account to Binford.
Border Patrol agents have said they have adequate supplies at Clint for most of the migrants’ needs. The facility lacks a kitchen, they said, so the ramen, granola bars, instant oatmeal and burritos that serve as most of the sustenance for migrants has been the best they could do.
Children sometimes could be seen crying, said one Border Patrol agent, who has worked for seven years at the Clint facility, but it most often seemed to be because they missed their parents. “It’s never because they’re mistreated; it’s because they’re homesick,” she said.
A Father Finds His Sons
Not long after Moak signed off on the conditions inside Clint, a man named Ruben was desperately trying to find his sons, 11-year-old twins who both have epilepsy.
The boys had crossed the border together in early June with their adult sister. They were hoping to reunite with their parents who had come to the United States earlier from El Salvador in order to earn enough money to pay for the boys’ epilepsy medications. They require daily injections and a strict regimen of care to prevent the seizures they began having at age 5.
But the twins were separated at the border from their sister and sent to Clint. The first time they spoke to Ruben on the phone, the two boys sobbed intensely and asked when they would be able to see their parents again.
“We don’t want to be here,” they told him. Ruben asked that his last name and the names of his sons be withheld for fear of retaliation by the U.S. government.
Only later did Ruben learn that the boys had been given at least some of their epilepsy medication, and neither one had had a seizure. But one boy reported breaking out in a skin rash, his face and arms turning red and flaky. Both had come down with fevers and said they had been sent temporarily to the “flu cell.”
“There is no one to take care of you there,” one told his father.
It took 13 days after the boys were detained to speak to their father over the phone. A lawyer who had entered the facility, Clara Long of Human Rights Watch, met the boys, tracked down their parents, and helped them make a call. The boys were stoic and quiet, she said, and shook her hand as if “trying to act like little adults” — until they spoke to their father. Then, they could answer only with one- or two-word answers, Long said, and were wiping tears from their faces.
Much of the crowding appears to have been relieved at Clint, and overall arrivals at the border are slowing, as new policies make migrants, mainly from Central America, return to Mexico after they request asylum, as the summer heat deters travelers and as Mexico’s crackdown on its southern border prevents many from entering.
A Border Patrol agent who has long worked in the El Paso area said agents had tried to make things as easy as possible for the children; some bought toys and sports equipment on their own to bring in. “Agents play board games and sports with them,” he said.
But the Border Patrol long “took great pride” in quickly processing migrant families, and making sure children did not remain in their rudimentary stations for longer than 72 hours, the agent said. Clint, he said, “is not a place for kids.”
In the surrounding town, many residents were puzzled and sad at the news of what was happening to children in the station on Alameda Avenue.
“I don’t know what the hell happened, but they’ve diverted from their original mission,” said Julián Molinar, 66, a retired postal deliveryman who lives in a house facing the station. He served in the Army in Europe as the Berlin Wall came down, he said, and was dismayed that there was now talk of building a border wall near his home. As for the Clint facility, he said, “children should not be held here.”
Dora Aguirre, Clint’s mayor, expressed sympathy for the agents, who are part of the community in Clint and neighboring El Paso. “They’re just trying to do their job as a federal agency,” she said. “They are trying to do the best they can.”

Do We Really Need AC?

Texto completo: Modernity was born nearly 117 years ago, at a printing plant in the East Williamsburg section of Brooklyn in New York City, when a junior engineer named Willis Carrier devised a contraption that blew air over water-filled pipes to dry out the humidity that was gumming up the pages of a humor magazine called Judge.
And in that moment (well, within a few decades), entire industries and geographies were transformed, and new technologies made possible, including, terribly, the internet: Without cooling, there would be no server farms.
Nearly 90 percent of American households now have some form of air conditioning, more than any other country in the world except Japan, though that will change as global warming alters more temperate zones, and swelling populations and rising incomes in hot zones mean the folks there will clamor for AC, too.
On an overheated planet, air conditioning becomes more and more desirable, solving in the short term the problem it helped create.
It is another paradox that even as architects and engineers are making ever more efficient buildings to meet energy standards set by cities like New York, where a new law says that buildings over 25,000 square feet must reduce their carbon emissions by 80 percent by 2050, we are still freezing in our offices and fighting with our partners over whether to turn on the Friedrich.
Parts of Germany and France were recently steaming through record temperatures - during last week’s heat wave, police officers in Paris used tear gas on climate-change protesters - while I was southbound on Amtrak’s Northeast Regional, shivering in the quiet car, rugged up in a scarf, jacket, long pants and boots.
So were my fellow travelers, like Solange Singer, a 41-year-old fashion stylist muffled in similar gear, with a red wool scarf laid out on her lap like a blanket. The conductor seemed puzzled when I asked him what temperature the thermostat was set to. There is no thermostat, he said: “It’s either off or on.”
“Cooling is the removal of heat, a form of dieting,” Neri Oxman, the computational designer and architect in charge of the Mediated Matter Group at MIT’s Media Lab, said in an email.
She and her colleagues are developing self-cooling building facades and clothing.
“Overcooling using conventional AC is extreme dieting, removing calories without improving nutrition,” Oxman said. “One ends up installing heaters in summer in office spaces that do not enable local temperature control - the quintessential sugar rush. Air conditioning demystifies nature’s miracles, and contributes to a culture characterized by disconnection and overconsumption.”
Growables and wearables
At MIT, Oxman’s team is experimenting with polymers and bacteria in the hopes they might “grow” building facades, and “wearables” - clothing, for example - complete with arteries to hold cooled liquids or gas. They can already 3D-print glass structures with “spatial pockets” designed to be filled with cooling liquid, as well as “biocompatible synthetic skins” for bodies and buildings, Oxman said, which would “act as thermodynamic, environmentally sensitive filters and barriers” to respond to temperature changes in the environment and self-regulate.
Oxman, preternaturally gifted, is attempting to make buildings that sweat. But in her own office, she had been flummoxed by the temperature, suffering the icy blasts of summer until she hacked the AC system and dismantled it.
There is an oft-cited study published in Nature.com that notes how building temperatures, once set to the comfort preferences of 1960s-era men in suits, disregard the “thermal comfort” of female staffers.
Come summer, Twitter invariably lights up with charges that air conditioning is sexist, an engine of the patriarchy, in threads that in turn fire up conservative commentators eager to prove the daftness of the opposition.
Building temperatures are largely controlled by building managers, to industry standards that aim for the thermal comfort of 80 percent of a building’s occupants - which means, of course, that 20 percent will be uncomfortable, if not miserable.
Those standards are updated regularly by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers, which suggests that building temperatures range from 67 to 82 degrees and be set according to an enormously complicated calculus.
Among the variables are the number of occupants in the place, what they’re wearing (with values assigned to 17 clothing styles, including sweatpants, miniskirts and bathrobes), humidity, air speed (at one’s ankles) and more. No wonder everyone is caviling. You can’t expect building managers to behave like Stephen Hawking.
Many offices, including those of The New York Times, set their thermostats to 74 to 76 degrees, which you would think would feel balmy (imagine a thermostat set to that temperature during winter). Yet the other day, my colleagues - probably about 20 percent of them - were shivering in sweatshirts and sweaters. (Patrick Whelan, facilities director at The Times, blamed those in the Page One meeting room, who wanted that space to be cooler.)
Gender differences
The Times has a nearly even gender split; 51 percent of its employees are female. But what of 100 percent female operations? How do they handle their thermostats? At all eight locations of the Wing, the coworking space designed for women, the seating has been fabricated to accommodate a 5-foot-4 woman - the average female height - in soft fabrics, like velvet, anticipating users with bare legs.
In the summer months, temperature is similarly considered: The thermostats are set to 72 to 74 degrees, said Zara Rahim, senior director of communications, a number gleaned from reading studies that suggested men were happier at 70 degrees, and women at temperatures 2.5 degrees higher.
If members are still chilly, there are baskets of knitted cotton blankets placed strategically throughout the club. On a recent visit to the Wing Soho, the place looked like a college dorm during exam week, with some members sitting cross-legged in armchairs, laptops open, their laps swaddled in blankets.
In 2015, Kieran Timberlake, an architectural firm with more than 100 employees in Philadelphia, tried to work without any air conditioning at all. The firm renovated a former bottling plant - a concrete and steel warehouse built in 1945 - with many, many design flourishes and technologies, but without modern AC.
Passive and active features provided the cooling, like mechanical and natural ventilation (fans and windows that opened); automated shades; insulation, including a concrete slab floor; and dehumidifiers. The design thinking behind these contemporary refinements has worked for millenniums - imagine an adobe house, or a Roman villa, sealed and shaded against the day’s heat, and opened up at night.
That first summer, however, staffers found themselves increasingly hot, limp and damp, their experience captured by daily surveys that included this plaintive report from one suffering soul: “I am physically melting.”
More fans were brought in, employees were encouraged to work early in the morning - before the day got too hot - and the dress code was relaxed. Clients who visited, including State Department officials (at the time, the firm was working on a U.S. Embassy in London) were forewarned. Witold Rybczynski, writing of the experiment in Architect magazine, imagined a scene from a P.G. Wodehouse novel: diplomats in short pants!
Mixing it up
It was a grand experiment, and not exactly a failure, since the building, which is now cooled by what’s known as mixed-mode operation - that is, using a bit of conventional air conditioning when needed - is still a model of energy efficiency. Switching to mixed mode has added only 1 percent or 2 percent to the building’s total energy load, according to Roderick Bates, a Kieran Timberlake principal.
Bates said one of the reasons natural cooling wasn’t fully successful was that Philadelphia’s nighttime temperatures during the peak summer months weren’t low enough to allow natural ventilation to cool the place down. Passive house systems work really well in climates with big diurnal temperature swings, like the desert.
A byproduct of the experiment was the evolution of the survey process, now a cloud-based app called Roast, that revealed something rather illuminating: While there were slightly more survey responses from female staff, the differences in thermal comfort between sexes were insignificant. (Are women just more inclined to participate in surveys?)
It turns out gender is less a predictor of thermal comfort than other factors, like age, activity level or, tellingly, the relative wealth of the society surveyed, according to studies conducted by researchers at the Center for the Built Environment at the University of California, Berkeley.
People in countries with a lower gross domestic product, said David Lehrer, communications director and a researcher there, are more comfortable with a wider range of temperatures. It appears that first-world discomfort is a learned behavior.

Texto completo: Modernity was born nearly 117 years ago, at a printing plant in the East Williamsburg section of Brooklyn in New York City, when a junior engineer named Willis Carrier devised a contraption that blew air over water-filled pipes to dry out the humidity that was gumming up the pages of a humor magazine called Judge.
And in that moment (well, within a few decades), entire industries and geographies were transformed, and new technologies made possible, including, terribly, the internet: Without cooling, there would be no server farms.
Nearly 90% of American households now have some form of air conditioning, more than any other country in the world except Japan, though that will change as global warming alters more temperate zones, and swelling populations and rising incomes in hot zones mean the folks there will clamor for AC, too.
On an overheated planet, air conditioning becomes more and more desirable, solving in the short term the problem it helped create.
It is another paradox that even as architects and engineers are making ever more efficient buildings to meet energy standards set by cities like New York, where a new law says that buildings over 25,000 square feet must reduce their carbon emissions by 80% by 2050, we are still freezing in our offices and fighting with our partners over whether to turn on the Friedrich.
Parts of Germany and France were recently steaming through record temperatures - during last week’s heat wave, police officers in Paris used tear gas on climate-change protesters - while I was southbound on Amtrak’s Northeast Regional, shivering in the quiet car, rugged up in a scarf, jacket, long pants and boots.
So were my fellow travelers, like Solange Singer, a 41-year-old fashion stylist muffled in similar gear, with a red wool scarf laid out on her lap like a blanket. The conductor seemed puzzled when I asked him what temperature the thermostat was set to. There is no thermostat, he said: “It’s either off or on.”
“Cooling is the removal of heat, a form of dieting,” Neri Oxman, the computational designer and architect in charge of the Mediated Matter Group at MIT’s Media Lab, said in an email.
She and her colleagues are developing self-cooling building facades and clothing.
“Overcooling using conventional AC is extreme dieting, removing calories without improving nutrition,” Oxman said. “One ends up installing heaters in summer in office spaces that do not enable local temperature control - the quintessential sugar rush. Air conditioning demystifies nature’s miracles, and contributes to a culture characterized by disconnection and overconsumption.”
Growables and wearables
At MIT, Oxman’s team is experimenting with polymers and bacteria in the hopes they might “grow” building facades, and “wearables” - clothing, for example - complete with arteries to hold cooled liquids or gas. They can already 3D-print glass structures with “spatial pockets” designed to be filled with cooling liquid, as well as “biocompatible synthetic skins” for bodies and buildings, Oxman said, which would “act as thermodynamic, environmentally sensitive filters and barriers” to respond to temperature changes in the environment and self-regulate.
Oxman, preternaturally gifted, is attempting to make buildings that sweat. But in her own office, she had been flummoxed by the temperature, suffering the icy blasts of summer until she hacked the AC system and dismantled it.
There is an oft-cited study published in Nature.com that notes how building temperatures, once set to the comfort preferences of 1960s-era men in suits, disregard the “thermal comfort” of female staffers.
Come summer, Twitter invariably lights up with charges that air conditioning is sexist, an engine of the patriarchy, in threads that in turn fire up conservative commentators eager to prove the daftness of the opposition.
Building temperatures are largely controlled by building managers, to industry standards that aim for the thermal comfort of 80% of a building’s occupants - which means, of course, that 20% will be uncomfortable, if not miserable.
Those standards are updated regularly by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers, which suggests that building temperatures range from 67 to 82 degrees and be set according to an enormously complicated calculus.
Among the variables are the number of occupants in the place, what they’re wearing (with values assigned to 17 clothing styles, including sweatpants, miniskirts and bathrobes), humidity, air speed (at one’s ankles) and more. No wonder everyone is caviling. You can’t expect building managers to behave like Stephen Hawking.
Many offices, including those of The New York Times, set their thermostats to 74 to 76 degrees, which you would think would feel balmy (imagine a thermostat set to that temperature during winter). Yet the other day, my colleagues - probably about 20% of them - were shivering in sweatshirts and sweaters. (Patrick Whelan, facilities director at The Times, blamed those in the Page One meeting room, who wanted that space to be cooler.)
Gender differences
The Times has a nearly even gender split; 51% of its employees are female. But what of 100% female operations? How do they handle their thermostats? At all eight locations of the Wing, the coworking space designed for women, the seating has been fabricated to accommodate a 5-foot-4 woman - the average female height - in soft fabrics, like velvet, anticipating users with bare legs.
In the summer months, temperature is similarly considered: The thermostats are set to 72 to 74 degrees, said Zara Rahim, senior director of communications, a number gleaned from reading studies that suggested men were happier at 70 degrees, and women at temperatures 2.5 degrees higher.
If members are still chilly, there are baskets of knitted cotton blankets placed strategically throughout the club. On a recent visit to the Wing Soho, the place looked like a college dorm during exam week, with some members sitting cross-legged in armchairs, laptops open, their laps swaddled in blankets.
In 2015, Kieran Timberlake, an architectural firm with more than 100 employees in Philadelphia, tried to work without any air conditioning at all. The firm renovated a former bottling plant - a concrete and steel warehouse built in 1945 - with many, many design flourishes and technologies, but without modern AC.
Passive and active features provided the cooling, like mechanical and natural ventilation (fans and windows that opened); automated shades; insulation, including a concrete slab floor; and dehumidifiers. The design thinking behind these contemporary refinements has worked for millenniums - imagine an adobe house, or a Roman villa, sealed and shaded against the day’s heat, and opened up at night.
That first summer, however, staffers found themselves increasingly hot, limp and damp, their experience captured by daily surveys that included this plaintive report from one suffering soul: “I am physically melting.”
More fans were brought in, employees were encouraged to work early in the morning - before the day got too hot - and the dress code was relaxed. Clients who visited, including State Department officials (at the time, the firm was working on a U.S. Embassy in London) were forewarned. Witold Rybczynski, writing of the experiment in Architect magazine, imagined a scene from a P.G. Wodehouse novel: diplomats in short pants!
Mixing it up
It was a grand experiment, and not exactly a failure, since the building, which is now cooled by what’s known as mixed-mode operation - that is, using a bit of conventional air conditioning when needed - is still a model of energy efficiency. Switching to mixed mode has added only 1% or 2% to the building’s total energy load, according to Roderick Bates, a Kieran Timberlake principal.
Bates said one of the reasons natural cooling wasn’t fully successful was that Philadelphia’s nighttime temperatures during the peak summer months weren’t low enough to allow natural ventilation to cool the place down. Passive house systems work really well in climates with big diurnal temperature swings, like the desert.
A byproduct of the experiment was the evolution of the survey process, now a cloud-based app called Roast, that revealed something rather illuminating: While there were slightly more survey responses from female staff, the differences in thermal comfort between sexes were insignificant. (Are women just more inclined to participate in surveys?)
It turns out gender is less a predictor of thermal comfort than other factors, like age, activity level or, tellingly, the relative wealth of the society surveyed, according to studies conducted by researchers at the Center for the Built Environment at the University of California, Berkeley.
People in countries with a lower gross domestic product, said David Lehrer, communications director and a researcher there, are more comfortable with a wider range of temperatures. It appears that first-world discomfort is a learned behavior.

Texto completo: LONDON -- It should have been a moment of celebration for Tori Allen-Martin and Sarah Henley, two British playwrights.
On Thursday, "Tree," a play they worked on for several years in collaboration with the actor Idris Elba, is set to have its world premiere at the Manchester International Festival. It is directed by Kwame Kwei-Armah, the artistic director of the Young Vic theater in London, where it will transfer from July 29.
But the playwrights will not be at the premiere. In separate telephone interviews, they said their role in the play's development had been erased, and that their work was not being properly acknowledged.
Mr. Elba and Mr. Kwei-Armah say the playwrights withdrew from the project, and that the show evolved so much that it is now a different work.
Ms. Allen-Martin and Ms. Henley said they have spent months wrangling with the show's producers and their lawyers over what they see as proper credit for their work.
"This whole process has been terribly upsetting, and we've felt terrified about speaking out," the pair wrote in a blog post, published Tuesday on Medium.
"People need to be better, especially people who inspire others," they added.
Ms. Allen-Martin and Ms. Henley said they had not seen the final production, or read the final script, but said the play's description on the festival's website had similarities to their script.
On Thursday, Idris Elba, who declined through a spokeswoman to comment for this article, responded with a statement on Twitter. Ms. Allen-Martin and Ms. Henley stepped back voluntarily from the production after they were told it needed to go in a new direction, Mr. Elba said.
"We wanted to offer an opportunity to support these new writers while creating a piece of work of scale and to a director's vision," Mr. Elba said. "The outcome is an accusation of plagiarism and discrimination."
The flap has gripped Britain's theater world, where open disputes about authorship and attribution are rare. But an editorial in The Stage, an industry newspaper, said that "putting aside the precise details of this case, aspects of the pair's narrative will appear depressingly familiar."
Bryony Kimmings, a performer and writer, said in a telephone interview that she had never been removed from a project herself, but that she knew other writers who had. They would normally get a credit, such as saying a work was "based on an original story" by them, and a fee or royalty payment anyway, she said.
There was a culture of "hero worship" in Britain's theaters, she said, and many were reluctant to acknowledge projects were collaborations and give recognition to everyone involved.
Ms. Allen-Martin and Ms. Henley said their work on "Tree" dated to January 2015, when Mr. Elba asked Ms. Allen-Martin to help him make a musical based on an album he had released called "Mi Mandela."
The playwrights wrote a script outline for "Tree," about a mixed-race young man from London whose parents met during Apartheid, and who travels on a journey to South Africa to discover his roots.
In March 2016, they signed a "deal memo" with Mr. Elba's production company Green Door and a theater company, Duchess Street Productions. The agreement, seen by The New York Times, includes details of royalties and states that other writers can be brought on board only with the approval of Ms. Allen-Martin and Ms. Henley.
In a statement, Green Door, the Young Vic and the Manchester International Festival said this was only a script "for consideration." "It is important to appreciate that 'Tree' has always been Idris' project," the statement added.
In May 2018, Mr. Elba called Ms. Allen-Martin, she said, to confirm that "Tree," was going ahead -- and in a big way: The Manchester International Festival was onboard and the Young Vic wanted to partner on the show. "It felt like our big break," Ms. Allen-Martin said.
Later that month, the playwrights said they met Mr. Kwei-Armah to discuss what would happen next. He was effusive and passionate about the project, Ms. Allen-Martin said. They discussed some changes to the play's direction to give "Tree" more of a concert feel and involve the audience more, she said, and left feeling positive about the project moving forward.
"It was one of the most exciting days of our lives," said Ms. Henley. "I cried when I came out."
Then things went wrong, she said.
On Oct. 18, they were emailed a revised synopsis by Mr. Kwei-Armah that contained elements of their story, but changed from a tale of hope and celebration to "more of a black trauma narrative" which the playwrights were unhappy with, they said in their Medium post.
Ms. Allen-Martin and Ms. Henley added they then tried to have discussions about what this meant and what their future roles would be, but Mr. Kwei-Armah declined to speak directly.
In an open letter to Ms. Allen-Martin and Ms. Henley posted on Twitter on Tuesday, Mr. Kwei-Armah said he never refused to meet the playwrights. "Quite the opposite," he wrote: "I continually requested for us to simply meet and discuss that the outline was only a creative jumping off point."
In November, the playwrights received an email saying their script would not be used and their "writing services" were no longer required.
Ms. Allen-Martin said she and Ms. Henley were offered 10,000 British pounds -- about $ 12,500 -- and a "with thanks to" credit in the playbill. They rejected the offer.
Ms. Allen-Martin and Ms. Henley are thanked by Mr. Elba in the playbill, in a list of people "who worked with me along the way," but aren't acknowledged as members of the creative team.
Ms. Henley said they only decided to go public with their story as they had run out of other options. "There was so much fear before doing this," she said. "We talked to a lot of people and most said, 'You'll get blacklisted."'
"I've based my career on being open and truthful," Ms. Allen-Martin said. "It didn't feel truthful to hide it."

Pignanelli and Webb: A patriotic holiday doesn't bring Americans together

Texto completo: Along with parades, fireworks and family gatherings, the celebration of our nation’s founding is also a time to reflect on the blessings of freedom and our nation’s founding principles. Might such patriotic sentiments bring together Republicans and Democrats in a show of unity? Nah. Not a chance.
The first Democratic presidential debates revealed a Democratic Party lurching far to the left, while President Trump engages in bombast, taunts and insults. What impact does this dysfunctional national political climate have on Utah politics?
Pignanelli: "Right now we’ve got two parties trying to make political moderates homeless.”— David Brooks, The New York Times
American politics today is a massive version of reality TV with performances every day on television and social media. Issues are overdramatized, while the players are hypersensitive. As with any entertainment, extremists grab most of the attention while driving programming content. Saying outrageous things while being outraged is the norm. There is no better example than the last two weeks’ statements made from the debate podium, the president, Congress, Twitter, Facebook and cable news. (Things are so weird, the Betsy Ross flag is now controversial.)
Thankfully, Utahns prefer a more genteel version of politics. But the effects of the national circus are everywhere and cannot be ignored or misunderstood. Local Republicans and Democrats will soon need to distinguish themselves from crazy partisans in Washington, D.C., or otherwise be caught in the net of disgust by their voters. Angering the extremes may cause short-term pain, but history demonstrates such is beneficial strategy in the long run.
Reality TV is not reality. Similarly, the political antics do not mirror how most Americans, especially Utahns, interact or express themselves. So, enjoy or change the channel.
Webb: Unlike what happens at the national level, in Utah we actually deal with disagreements on controversial issues pretty well. It is possible to disagree and do so in a reasonably civil manner.
National politicians could learn from Utah, but they won’t. And, certainly, the toxic partisanship on national issues and national leaders rubs off on Utahns, as evidenced by the nasty stuff we see on social media and in letters to the editor.
Emotions run high because both sides believe the future of the country is at stake. Many Republicans, myself included, are scornful of the liberal, socialist positions of the Democratic presidential candidates. And we aren’t shy about expressing those feelings.
Likewise, many Democrats literally hate President Donald Trump, believing he is a liar, racist, rapist, bigot and is rapidly destroying the country. Civility and compromise are hard to find amid such strong sentiments.
But on specific issues, such as immigration, liberals ought to put aside their hatred of Trump, and conservatives ought to put aside their disdain of socialism, to compromise on commonsense solutions. It wouldn’t be very difficult if both sides would focus on solutions instead of emotions.
In other words, go ahead and hate Trump. But solve immigration. Go ahead and reject socialistic schemes. But solve immigration.
Seldom has the partisan divide been worse. National Republicans and Democrats appear to be on totally different political planets. Is the country being damaged by such discord and acrimony?
Pignanelli: Actually, more discord and acrimony are needed. Rational moderates must stop the extreme left and right wings from hogging the agenda. Americans who achieved influence have an obligation to publicly defend our system against anti-capitalist nonsense and discriminatory statements destructive to our social fabric.
Our economy is sound. Most disease results from an abundance of food. Important efforts to take advantage of technology, improve job creation, enhance entrepreneurial opportunities, advance health care and confront climate change are evolving. Americans are doing what we do best — screaming and shouting while getting the job done.
Webb: The anger and hatred mean some of the country’s biggest problems are used for talking points instead of being solved. Until politicians are willing to settle for partial wins, each side getting some of what it wants, gridlock and dysfunction will continue.
Do any solutions exist to restore compromise and political progress, or are we doomed to ever-escalating partisan rancor?
Pignanelli: Our nation was founded by argument and we never stopped. Much of the rancor is a sign of a healthy, invigorated democracy, engaged by people informed through technology. History documents issues that deeply divided our country — including many no longer remembered (i.e. free silver) and those which haunt us (slavery) — did not and will not prevent us from facing significant challenges together.
Webb: A major reason for failure at the national level is that the federal government is too big, too expensive, and inserts itself into every facet of life. The country is too large and diverse for one-size-fits-all solutions dictated by Washington.
State and local levels of government, for the most part, are productive and solve problems. If the federal government would stick to its constitutional responsibilities, and leave the rest to the states, the country would be in better shape.
Battles would continue over federal responsibilities like immigration and foreign affairs. But myriad other issues would be resolved, with a lot of diversity and innovation, at state and local levels.

Texto completo: In diplomacy, small steps can lead to big change.
President Donald Trump's few steps onto North Korean territory last week should be appreciated for what they represent (America's improving relationship with one of the world's most insular states) and what they portend (further reductions in tension on the Korean Peninsula).
Critics have complained that Mr. Trump's various meetings with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un have been little more than showboating. They've produced no progress in dismantling Mr. Kim's nuclear program yet given Mr. Kim a legitimacy his brutally repressive regime does not deserve.
But dialing back the engagement, or going on the offensive, is hardly a viable alternative. Saber-rattling hasn't improved America's relations with Iran. The tariff chess game hasn't helped U.S. ties to China. Decades of trying to isolate Cuba produced ... nothing.
Relationships, such as the one Ronald Reagan had with Mikhail Gorbachev and the one that Jimmy Carter had with Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin, are the key to change. Mr. Trump has gotten closer to North Korean officials than any other president in history - remarkable considering Mr. Trump's and Mr. Kim's mutual penchant for bellicosity -and he's the first president to step foot on North Korean soil.
Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim both noted the significance of the moment, which occurred during a meeting at the Demilitarized Zone officially separating North Korea and South Korea. The dictator invited the leader of the free world to step across the border, and the latter obliged. It's the kind of development that pays dividends down the road - maybe not with Mr. Kim renouncing his nuclear ambitions but with wins of other kinds.
Clearly, Mr. Kim, whose family has been shunned by so many for so long, appreciates the attention paid him by Mr. Trump. The British, Germans and French certainly aren't courting him, and China, North Korea's one true ally, treats Mr. Kim like a wayward brother. He'll want to keep the goodwill with Mr. Trump alive.
Critics have suggested that Mr. Trump's friendliness toward Mr. Kim is disrespectful to the family of Otto Warmbier, the Ohio college student arrested during a visit to North Korea in 2016 and returned to the U.S. just days before his death from unexplained head injuries he sustained in captivity.
At the time of Warmbier's detention and death, Mr. Trump had no relationship with Mr. Kim. Now, the president can leverage the pair's rapport in future crises. There already are signs that the relationship is bearing fruit. As The New York Times noted, Mr. Kim has freed some American prisoners, returned the remains of some servicemen missing since the Korean War, put a halt to nuclear tests, paid more attention to his economy and permitted a black market to operate among his impoverished people.
Overnight change in North Korea is extremely unlikely. But engagement has the potential to alter North Korea incrementally, and that is better than nothing.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — One by one came the flyovers — the Coast Guard helicopters, the brand new F-22 Raptors, the Blue Angels — at President Trump's Fourth of July celebration of the military, an event he orchestrated with tanks on the National Mall, military leaders in attendance, and himself center stage.
“Our nation is stronger today than it was ever before," Trump declared, speaking behind a pane of bulletproof glass that was streaked with rain. “It is its strongest now."
Trump's “Salute to America" was the culmination of his long-held dream of showing off the nation's military hardware — a dream that drew deep concern from his critics about the politicization of the armed forces and some reticence from the defense community.
As the president spoke Thursday in front of the Lincoln Memorial, he stayed uncharacteristically on-script, swapping the partisan barbs and embittered asides that characterize his MAGA rallies for a focused tribute to the branches of the military.
“Together we are part of one of the greatest stories ever told, the story of America," Trump said. “It is the epic tale of a great nation, whose people have risked everything for what they know is right and what they know is true."
He paid tribute to figures in the crowd, such as an astronaut, a nun, and a civil rights activist, and referred to the famous speech that the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered right where Trump was standing.
"Americans love our freedom and no one will ever take it away from us," Trump said. "For Americans, nothing is impossible.
"In 1963, Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. stood here on these very steps and called on our nation to live out the true meaning of its creed and let freedom ring for every citizen all across our land," he said.
Even if Trump managed to avoid talk of politics, and himself, the spectacle of a president inserting himself so centrally into the nation's Independence Day celebration vaulted a day generally reserved for grilling, flag T-shirts, and feel-good displays of patriotism into America's partisan fracas. The nation's deep political divides were on tense display as spectators descended on the National Mall, with many taking sides for or against Trump.
“I saw how Trump's opponents came out saying all sorts of nonsense: 'Oh, this is what dictators do,' " said David Shoup, 66, a veteran of Iraq and Afghanistan who said the criticism motivated him to drive 660 miles from Dublin, Ga., to park himself on the National Mall. “I thought, I'm going up to support the president."
Around Shoup, hundreds of spectators clad in “Make America Great Again" hats or swathed in clear ponchos over Trump T-shirts lined up near chain-link fencing close to the Lincoln Memorial, where Trump was to speak in front of an area cordoned off for people with special tickets. Some of the VIP tickets were reportedly distributed by the Republican National Committee, much to the consternation of Democrats.
“I think this is Caeser throwing a party for his supporters," said Ed Schudel, 51, a conservative Democrat from Virginia who said the event felt more partisan, more angry than previous celebrations he has attended on the Mall.
The event also highlighted the president's complex relationship with Washington's defense establishment and military leaders. Trump, who never served in uniform, loves the trappings of the military even though he has frustrated his defense advisers with hasty decision-making and wariness of foreign entanglements. Last month, The New York Times reported, Trump ordered a strike on Iran and then called it off at the last minute. He also became the first president to step into North Korea after a meeting with Kim Jong Un arranged almost by tweet.
At one point during his speech on Thursday, Trump bragged the US military had helped to “obliterate the ISIS Caliphate just recently in Syria — 100 percent gone."
Syria has been a particularly controversial issue for the president. Last year, Trump's defense secretary, retired general Jim Mattis, resigned after the president abruptly announced he planned to pull US troops out of Syria.
“He views part of America's strength as coming from rhetoric and coming from showing — perhaps even exaggerating — the size of the stick we're carrying," said Fernando Cutz, who was the senior adviser to Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster, Trump's former national security adviser.
“This is a president that actually doesn't want to go to war."
Trump had wanted a military parade since Bastille Day of 2017, when he watched the French President Emanuel Macron glide down the Champs Elysees in a military command car, surrounded by mounted guards.
“We're going to have to try and top it," Trump said at the time. “It was really so well done."
The United States has held numerous military parades over the course of its history, including in 1991 after the end of the Gulf War, and holidays like Veterans Day and Memorial Day frequently use military weaponry and vehicles to honor the troops.
But previous presidents — including Dwight D. Eisenhower — had deep reservations about gratuitous displays of military might.
“He said many times that military force and military power was a tragedy, it was a symbol of failure, it was a waste, and it robbed people of all of the benefits of civilization," said William Hitchcock, a professor of history at the University of Virginia.
After considered pushback from local government all the way up to the Department of Defense, Trump's parade idea was scrapped — but the “Salute to America" was eventually born. With tanks sitting under steady rain in Washington by Thursday evening, it was a far cry from Trump's initial vision.
“The victim is the US military which is in the middle of it, trying desperately to be apolitical and frankly would rather be home grilling burgers with their family than getting used as wallpaper and garden gnomes on a stage," said Peter Feaver, an adviser on the National Security Council's staff during the administration of George W. Bush.
Trump administration officials have refused to say how much taxpayers will pay for the celebration. The Washington Post reported that the National Park Service is diverting almost $2.5 million in fees to cover some of the costs.
On the Mall, even some supporters of Trump, like Victoria Camp, a retired schoolteacher who lives in the Washington area, said disapprovingly that the president had imbued “America's birthday" with politics.
As if to prove her point, she began complaining about Democrats. “If we think we're going to give away free this, free that, cancel your debt, reparations, where is the incentive to do or become anything?" she asked.
Further down the Mall, Meg Haugh lamented the fact that she had had to deflate a balloon depicting Trump as a baby in a diaper in order to get past security for the event — but brightened up when a passing spectator, Carrie Fuhrer, saw her Pete Buttigieg T-shirt and gave her a high-five.
“It's so very scary that someone would be able to do this," Fuhrer said, looking at the people clad in Trump gear around her, and said she was leaving: “We're going back to a real town, with real people."
But Jim Zinni, a Marine veteran and government contractor in a Make America Great Again hat who traveled to the event with his wife from New Bern, N.C., said he deeply appreciated the tribute to his service.
“That's what makes your heart pump, that's what Fourth of July is about," Zinni said. “The military has always kept our country free."

There was one clear winner from last week’s Democratic debates

Texto completo: It’s been exactly one week since the Democratic candidates for president participated in their first debates, and America finally got a taste of what life would be like if one of them made it all the way to the White House.
Universal health care for illegal aliens, a return to forced busing and legalized abortion for transgender women were just a few of the promises made from the Miami debate stage.
And to think, some people used to regard this crop as being out-of-touch with middle America. Sheesh!
Trying to win votes in backwards places like Oklahoma is so yesterday, these candidates have their sights set on Wokelahoma!
Get with the program.
Each debate featured ten candidates and lasted a total of two hours. Watching that line-up being introduced was like watching the first show of the season on ‘Dancing With The Stars’. I kept saying, “Who the hell is that?”
Personally speaking, it would have made more sense to cast the debates the same way Southwest Airlines boards planes. “Candidates with last names A through L please report to the podiums now.”
“Senators Biden and Sanders, you are now eligible for pre-boarding.”
If voters were looking for a polite exchange ideas, they were disappointed. It didn’t take long for the claws to come out, and the kitties liked to scratch.
In fact, things got so impolite that Marianne Williamson didn’t even offer to do Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper’s astrological chart.
Rude.
The most contentious exchange in the debate happened when Sen. Kamala Harris went after former Vice President Joe Biden over his record on race relations.
“It was hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country…And it was not only that — you also worked with them to oppose busing,” Harris said.
Biden thought Kamala really threw him under the bus with that stuff about busing, particularly when she told a story about “a little girl in California” who was bused as a part of the second class to integrate public schools in her county. “And that little girl was me. So I will tell you that on this subject, it cannot be an intellectual debate among Democrats. We have to take it seriously. We have to act swiftly,” she insisted.
After the debate, the talking heads were just brutal in assessing Biden’s performance.
In an interview with MSNBC’s Chris Matthews, Harris was asked if Biden was “finished.”
MSNBC’s Joy Reid said that Harris “destabilized” Biden and is now a “frontrunner.”
And in the pages of the New York Times, columnist Maureen Dowd wrote, “Rather than asking Biden to pass the torch, she [Kamala Harris] took a blowtorch to him.”
This nonstop negative coverage was internalized by voters.
According to a Suffolk University/USA Today poll of likely Iowa Democratic caucus voters released after the debate, a third of those who do not support Biden cite the former veep’s age, lack of fresh ideas, or other reasons relating to his long political career as reasons for not supporting him.
That seems a little harsh to me. It’s not like Biden, who is 76, bragged about supporting the Lend-Lease Act.
Although in retrospect, I wish Bernie Sanders had used that old Ronald Reagan line on Biden: “I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent’s youth and inexperience.”
That would have killed.
Regardless of what the TV pundits say — if the Democrats yank their party this far to the left, the big winner of last week’s debates is President Donald Trump.
John Phillips can be heard weekdays at 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. on “The Morning Drive with John Phillips and Jillian Barberie” on KABC/AM 790.

Texto completo: What's Streaming
STRANGER THINGS Stream on Netflix. After a bit over a year and a half off, the 1980s are back. Or at least the '80s as shown through the Spielbergian lens of this Netflix sci-fi horror series, which follows a group of Midwestern youths coming-of-age in a town that exists in the shadow of the supernatural. Season 2 ramped up the emotion and romance amid the chaos. Season 3 finds the friends in the summer between middle school and high school -- so it'll probably be downright terrifying. (In an interview with The New York Times, the actor Cary Elwes, who plays the town mayor this season, mentioned "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" as a primary influence for Season 3.) The neon nostalgia factor runs high. "I always wonder if Apple iPhones and all these electronics that we use today are still going to be a thing in like 10, 20 years," the actor Noah Schnapp, who plays one of the friends, recently told The Times. "It's nice being on set, because it teaches you, oh, you don't need your phone all the time. People lived like this."
THE BRINK (2019) Stream on Hulu. Alison Klayman's fleet-footed documentary develops a portrait of Stephen K. Bannon, the former White House chief strategist and Breitbart News executive, from more than a year's worth of footage. "'The Brink' is a movie that people who hate Bannon may embrace -- they are surely the intended audience -- but that doesn't mean Bannon himself will hate it," A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The Times. Scott noted that it "both exposes and flatters his vanity." It's also a clear product of the present era, peppered with news cycles that fly by. The result, Scott wrote, is a "fast-moving, tightly packed, at times unnervingly entertaining documentary."
What's on TV
MACY'S FOURTH OF JULY FIREWORKS SPECTACULAR 8 p.m. on NBC. Luke Bryan, Khalid, Maren Morris and Brad Paisley are among the musicians set to perform at this year's big-budget Macy's Fourth of July celebration in New York. (Though they'll have to deliver quite spectacular performances to drum up the level of discussion that the Independence Day celebration happening in Washington has created.) The hosts are the dancer Derek Hough and the singer Ciara, with fireworks this year being set off from the Brooklyn Bridge and from barges near the South Street Seaport.
THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 (2014) 4 p.m. on FX. So far, this century has seen more Spider-Man movie stars than decades. With the latest of the Tom Holland-led iterations in theaters this weekend, revisit this second entry in Andrew Garfield's short career as perhaps the nimblest incarnation of the web-slinger. Or watch SPIDER-MAN 3 (2007), airing at 7:30 p.m. on Syfy, to see Tobey Maguire's Spidey put on a somber costume that could've been bought at a Hot Topic.

Africa on the rise
Out of Africa this week: another sign of tremendous church growth on the continent.
The Utah-based faith announced it will split the Africa Southeast Area next summer into a Central Area and a South Area. The specific boundaries have yet to be finalized, but the move is more than a bureaucratic reshuffling.
“The establishment of the new area will provide for significant increases in resources to this region of Africa in regards to manpower, financial resources, and attention by international church leaders regarding missionary work and outreach expansion,” independent demographer Matt Martinich writes at ldschurchgrowth.blogspot.com.
The three R’s — reading, ’riting and ’religion
The Good Book is helping members in Sierra Leone learn how to read other books.
A church-run pilot program is helping boost literacy while teaching gospel principles in the West African nation.
“Gospel literacy is about learning to read and write so you can understand … the principles of the gospel so that you can teach your own children or your neighbors,” project manager Melissa Hawkley said in a news release.
Students start, for example, by discussing a picture based on a story from the Bible or the Book of Mormon, explained another project manager, Cason Curriden. From there, they “transition into learning letters and forming words.”
Relief Society General President Jean B. Bingham, who visited Sierra Leone last month to launch the program, said that “reading opens up a world of ideas,” adding that “learners become leaders,” who then can influence the community.
BYU runner’s greatest race
Brigham Young University track athlete Emma Gee loves to race, but she isn’t running away from who she is.
The senior steeplechaser is the first-ever Division I athlete at the Provo school to come out publicly. Gee told administrators, her family and her teammates that she is bisexual. She then went public.
“I met with all the necessary parties (at BYU),” she told USA Today Sports. “I wanted them to know me first because homophobia and stigma (are rooted) in fear of the (unknown). I had to be very careful with my words, explaining: ‘I’ve dated – both boys and girls. But we’re not having sex or kissing.’”
In short, she’s heeding the school’s Honor Code, which forbids “not only sexual relations between members of the same sex, but all forms of physical intimacy that give expression to homosexual feelings.”
Gee says the church-owned school has taken steps toward greater LGBTQ awareness but insists longer strides are needed.
“It’s very easy to turn these things into lip service. That’s a huge problem at BYU,” Gee told USA Today Sports. “Just because you’re having the conversations doesn’t mean it should be mistaken for taking action in terms of improving culture — to actually be inclusive.”
The history-making runner plans to keep doing her part to help, noting that she knows other LGBTQ athletes at BYU who stay closeted for fear of repercussions.
“I’ve fallen down more times than I can count,” she says. “I’m not someone who walks away from something the first time it gets uncomfortable. I’m going to keep hurdling.”
Missionary money
Missionary wannabes waiting for their calls to serve are being called to save — more money.
The cost of serving a mission will go up 25% in July 2020, from the current $400 a month to $500, the first jump in nearly two decades. The price hike applies only to missionaries from the United States, Canada, Australia, Japan and more than a dozen European countries.
Missionaries and their families or congregations make these monthly payments to help cover living expenses.
“We hope that missionaries will use the time provided before this increase takes effect to carefully plan for meeting the expense of serving a mission,” church spokesman Daniel Woodruff wrote in an email.
“We know that many sacrifice greatly to help share our Heavenly Father’s love and the Savior’s restored gospel,” wrote the governing First Presidency in a June 27 letter.
Soon that sacrifice will include an extra $100 a month.
Nelson’s birthday bash
There will be no clowns, magicians, balloon animals or bounce houses. But a host of performers — including violinist Jenny Oaks Baker, The Bonner Family, Donny Osmond and The Tabernacle Choir and Orchestra at Temple Square — will be on hand.
The guest of honor: President Russell M. Nelson.
The birthday boy turns 95 on Sept. 9, and the gala marking the occasion is set for Sept. 6 in the 21,000-seat Conference Center in downtown Salt Lake City.
The celebration will share insights into the prophet-president’s life, ministry and service, a news release stated, with videos about his family, ministry and career as a renowned heart surgeon.
Free tickets will be available at ChurchofJesusChrist.org/events starting July 30 at 9 a.m.
This week’s podcast: The ‘greatest export’
Religious freedom.
Best-selling author Steven Waldman calls it “America’s greatest export” and warns that it is being threatened.
On that count, top Latter-day Saint leaders might agree. They bring the subject up often. President Russell M. Nelson discussed religious freedom in March with Pope Francis in their historic meeting at the Vatican and again this week with visiting Catholic Cardinal Timothy Dolan. Nelson’s first counselor, Dallin H. Oaks, a former Utah Supreme Court justice, still holds court on the issue in many of his sermons. And it was a major force in the so-called Utah compromise, a church-blessed effort that brought housing and employment protections to LGBTQ individuals.
Mormonism’s role in the evolution of religious liberty is part of Waldman’s new book, “Sacred Liberty: America’s Long, Bloody, and Ongoing Struggle for Religious Freedom.”
Listen here.
Unity of faiths
Four months after President Russell M. Nelson became the first Latter-day Saint prophet to have a private audience with a pope, the Mormon leader met with one of the nation’s most influential Catholics.
Cardinal Timothy Dolan, archbishop of New York, met with Nelson and other top Latter-day Saint leaders this week, further knotting the deepening ties between the two religions.
Dolan, in Utah to give a keynote address on religious liberty at a patriotic service for America’s Freedom Festival, huddled with Nelson and his second counselor, Henry B. Eyring, along with apostle M. Russell Ballard, acting president of the Quorum of the Twelve, according to a news release. The cardinal also toured Temple Square and Welfare Square.
“He has a great personality, he has got a great sense of humor, but he’s also committed to values that are consistent with the things that we believe in as disciples of Jesus Christ,” said apostle Quentin L. Cook, who introduced Dolan at the service.
“ … To have us be able to work together on things that would bless this country… whether they’re of a faith or no faith at all, has been an incredibly significant thing.”
For his part, Dolan emphasized that religious freedom is vital for believers and nonbelievers alike.
“We come together as neighbors, we come together as a family, we come together as friends,” the cardinal said. “See, that gives a counterexample to those who would love to caricature us as these bigoted, hateful, violent people. And we can't allow that to happen.”
From Russia to the Baltics
When the Russian police arrived on game night at the Latter-day Saint meetinghouse in Novorossiysk, Elder David Gaag knew his mission “would never be the same.”
Sure enough.
The young “volunteer” spent three weeks in detention before being deported. The eager and enthusiastic 19-year-old is now serving in Lithuania, where he can proudly sport his missionary nametag and openly preach anywhere, anytime to anyone.
He tells his experience in this exclusive Salt Lake Tribune story.
Ah, that name again
It’s been nearly a year since President Russell M. Nelson’s appeal to members, media, scholars and skeptics to stop using the words “Mormon” and “LDS.”
How’s it going? Well, the church has made a number of changes — from high-profile (think the Tabernacle Choir’s new name) to low-profile (new website domains).
But the shift has hardly been universal, The New York Times reports, both inside and outside the faith.
Of course, everyone — including top church leaders — knew from the get-go that it would take time, perhaps generations.
Quote of the week
“Stop looking for God where he is not — on some big white throne up in the sky — and start looking where he told you he would be: among the poor, the outcasts, the despised, and the broken. Stop looking up and start looking out.”

Texto completo: A Fort Collins author may have the chance to see her name on the big screen in the future.
Casey McQuiston's debut novel, "Red, White & Royal Blue" was picked up by Amazon and Berlanti Productions with the end goal of a theatrical film release.
The novel, which she classifies as a new adult romantic comedy, premiered on the New York Times and USA TODAY best-seller lists, as well as a number of lists highlighting the best books for Pride Month.
McQuiston's story focuses on Alex Claremont-Diaz, the first son of the United States, and his rival Prince Henry of Wales. After an incident involving the two, they stage a fake friendship that evolves into romance.
McQuiston optioned her novel in March 2019 — two months before her book went on sale.
Amazon Studios and Berlanti won the rights to the movie over several other competing studios. Berlanti has produced a number of big-name films, including hits "Love, Simon" and "Riverdale."
Wanting to preserve the integrity of the diversity she created in her story, McQuiston said one of the main reasons she selected Amazon and Berlanti was the likeness in mindset for the movie.
"I went with people who I felt could do the vision that we all wanted, which was this big theatrical rom-com, and who had also been very upfront about being very passionate about maintaining the diversity that was in the book and not pulling any punches, making it less gay, white-washing the characters or anything like that," McQuiston said.
The book officially hit the stands mid-May, just weeks before Pride Month. While the timing was not set up specifically to line up with the LGBTQ-celebratory month, McQuiston said it gave readers the chance to read the story and celebrate it throughout the month.
"Pride just means so much to me, I mean, it started as a riot, and I get to go around the country and engage with that in so many different places and also bring my book, which I feel is pretty subversive," McQuiston said. "It does mean so much to me to be able to walk in those footsteps and make my contribution in whatever way that I can."
As someone who identifies as a member of the LGBTQ community, it was important to McQuiston to not only write a story highlighting the community that does not often have a prominent place in mainstream literature, but also weave in bits of LGBTQ history throughout the story. A story created to serve as an escape from reality also serves as a channel to teach readers about a world they may otherwise not be informed about, McQuiston said.
"There were so many things that I put in that I was like, 'This is homework. Y'all are going to read this and I want you to go Google it,'" she said.
The "Red, White and Royal Blue" film is now in the early stages of development, and there is no set timeline for release.
While McQuiston has the option to be as involved or removed from the adaption process as she would like, she said she trusts the team at work to handle her story and make it into the film they envision.
"I just remember when I saw "Love, Simon" in the theaters, I just cried and was like, 'Oh my God, it is just so amazing that this was made, someone green-lit this and gave it a huge budget and it was allowed to be made into a theatrical movie that I can go see,'" McQuiston said. "I want that moment for other people when they go see my movie."

Republican Group to File Brief In Support of L.G.B.T. Rights

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- A group of three dozen current and former Republicans is urging the Supreme Court to declare that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 explicitly prohibits discrimination against gay men, lesbians and transgender people in the workplace. And they have tailored their arguments to resonate with a seemingly unlikely bloc on the court: its five conservatives.
In an amicus brief that will be filed with the court this week, the Republicans make the case that their view about how the law should be interpreted represents "a common sense, textualist approach" -- nodding to the school of legal thought on the right that disapproves of judges who go beyond a law's text when deciding how to apply it.
The arguments, though novel, are unlikely to satisfy some conservatives who believe that federal nondiscrimination laws do not cover sexual orientation and gender identity because Congress never provided for it in the original statute. The high court has agreed to hear three cases when it returns from its summer recess that concern whether the Civil Rights Act, which bans workplace discrimination based on sex, also guarantees gay and transgender people the same protection.
The cases are expected to provide the first indication of how the court's new conservative majority will approach L.G.B.T. rights.
The signers of the brief include a host of prominent former elected officials, party leaders and strategists like Alan Simpson, the former senator from Wyoming; Mark McKinnon, the media adviser for George W. Bush; Meg Whitman, the former chief executive of Hewlett-Packard; and Ken Mehlman, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee who helped lead a similar effort to recruit Republicans for an amicus brief in support of same-sex marriage.
Mr. Mehlman also wrote an op-ed about the topic for The New York Times.

The Republicans acknowledge the obvious: that Congress and the American public may not have anticipated that the landmark 1964 civil rights law would apply to gay men, lesbians and people with gender identities different from their sex at birth. But that is besides the point, they argue, because the text of the law is clear when it explicitly forbids treating people differently because of their sex.
The group advances its argument in a rather unexpected way, citing an opinion from Antonin Scalia, the former associate justice and icon of the conservative legal movement who has argued that laws routinely apply to situations that their drafters never could have envisioned.
A law's purpose "must be derived from the text, not from extrinsic sources such as legislative history or an assumption about the legal drafter's desires," the brief says, quoting Justice Scalia.
The court has already ruled, in effect, "We don't care what the legislators thought in 1964, the text of the law is clear," said Roy T. Englert, a Washington appellate lawyer who is the lead author of the brief. The issue of nondiscrimination protections for gay and transgender individuals may stir up cultural and political disagreement, but as a matter of law they should be straightforward, Mr. Englert added. "It's encrusted with a lot of baggage, but it's actually really simple."
The brief argues that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity is, at its core, discrimination against someone because of his or her sex and violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.
People who are fired because they are gay or lesbian are being treated differently for engaging in behavior that would be tolerated from them if they were members of the opposite sex -- in these cases, a man who is attracted to a man or a woman who is attracted to a woman.
It applies the same logic to discrimination against transgender individuals.
Most federal appeals courts have interpreted Title VII to exclude sexual orientation discrimination. But recently courts have split over the question. The cases the Supreme Court agreed to hear include one from New York in which a gay skydiving instructor said he was fired after a female customer complained about being tightly strapped to him during a tandem dive. The instructor, hoping to reassure her, told her that he was "100 percent gay." Judges from the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit concluded "sexual orientation discrimination is motivated, at least in part, by sex and is thus a subset of sex discrimination."
In a second case from Georgia, judges from the 11th Circuit reached the opposite conclusion, that sexual orientation-based discrimination and sex discrimination are not the same thing. The third case the Supreme Court will hear involves a woman who was fired from a Michigan funeral home after she announced in 2013 that she was transgender and would start wearing women's clothing to work. Judges in the Sixth Circuit sided with her, ruling that sex and gender identity cannot be disentangled.
Some conservatives have balked at the suggestion that it would be fundamentally conservative or textualist to see the law as covering sexual orientation and gender identity. The purpose of outlawing sex discrimination, they have pointed out, was to produce gender equality -- not to tackle other forms of discrimination.
Mr. Mehlman, who came out as gay in 2010 and has worked to build greater acceptance among Republicans for gay- and transgender-friendly policies, said that he hopes skeptical conservatives will understand that few principles are more in line with their beliefs than judging someone solely on merit.
"This case simply says that individuals ought to be judged based on the work they perform -- not based on their status, not based on their sexual orientation or gender identity," he said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

How the Nets Won the Battle Of New York

Texto completo: Rod Thorn was an assistant coach in 1976 when the Nets, as they moved from the American Basketball Association to the N.B.A., made the oft-lamented decision to sell Julius Erving's contract to the Philadelphia 76ers. Twenty-five years later, Thorn was the architect of the best trade in Nets history as the general manager who brought in Jason Kidd, who then led the woebegone franchise to back-to-back trips to the N.B.A. finals.
All of those memories, from the worst and best of a past life, came rushing back to Thorn on Sunday night. He was watching from his home in Rye, N.Y., as the Nets won their most meaningful duel yet with New York's purportedly more glamorous basketball team -- handily.
The Nets achieved, in less than four years, what the Knicks have been chasing for nearly 20: They signed two of the league's most coveted free agents. They lured the fantasy partnership of Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving to Brooklyn because Durant and Irving concluded that no other team in the N.B.A. was better positioned to handle their star power.
"The Nets have always been second in this area, because of the history, because of Madison Square Garden, because of everything the Knicks stand for," Thorn said in a phone interview. Recalling a stretch in which the Nets won 24 of 31 meetings between the teams, including a playoff sweep in 2004, Thorn added, "We had a much better team with Jason, but they were the Knicks."
They still are. Only now those Knicks have to contend with a geographical rival that emerged in record time from what appeared to be the bleakest of N.B.A. futures. Only three seasons removed from a 21-61 finish in 2015-16, and under a new general manager who began the climb without the usual draft and trade assets to improve, the Nets were seen as the far more desirable destination.
The best place to merge their talents, above all, is what Durant and Irving were looking for, according to a person familiar with their plans who was not authorized to discuss them publicly. Their determination to play together proved even stronger, in the end, than many league observers expected.
The Knicks and the Nets were the two teams that could most easily accommodate the players' salary demands, along with their shared desire to live in New York. Irving's enthusiasm for everything else the Nets could provide the star tandem, starting with General Manager Sean Marks's playoff-ready roster, increasingly appealed to Durant as the 2018-19 season wore on and the start of free agency grew near, according to the person.
Irving's fondness for the Nets, which grew throughout a season of tension and disappointment with the Boston Celtics, is not merely an offshoot of his New Jersey childhood. It stems in part from a hard sell of the franchise to Irving by Spencer Dinwiddie, the Nets reserve guard, after they shared a course at Harvard in September. Dinwiddie was Irving's classmate in a Harvard Business School program for athletes, "Crossover Into Business," that commenced last fall and continued remotely for a semester.
It was there that the two players from disparate talent tiers began building the bond that led to a regular dialogue and, by Sunday, brought Dinwiddie to the Nets' practice facility. Dinwiddie, who did not respond to a request for comment, was among the invitees summoned to join top team officials on the night Irving and Durant committed the next four seasons of their careers to the team that has spent virtually all of its 52-year existence in the Knicks' shadow.
Many rival teams had believed for months that Durant and Irving would team up next season -- but that they would do so with the Knicks. In the halls of Oracle Arena, especially, fears that Durant was unfulfilled as a Warrior and talk of losing him to the Knicks were frequent topics among edgy Golden State Warriors team officials, coaches and, occasionally, players.
Across the country, Dinwiddie was "at the forefront" of the monthslong push to persuade Irving to prioritize the Nets over the Knicks and to nudge Durant in the same direction, according to one person familiar with the Nets' pursuit of Irving who was not authorized to discuss it publicly.
The New York Times first reported last week that the Nets had also begun to heavily recruit the veteran center DeAndre Jordan, one of Durant's closest friends, to form an incoming trio with Durant and Irving. Jordan spent the last two months of the 2018-19 season as a Knick, but two people briefed on the negotiations said Jordan also was convinced in recent days that Barclays Center would be a more hospitable backdrop for Durant and Irving than Madison Square Garden and joined the chorus promoting the Nets.
Some around the league believe Durant's recent Achilles' tendon tear, more than any James L. Dolan-related ineptitude, is what doomed the Knicks. Such thinking holds that if he wasn't forced to sit out most or all of next season, Durant might have lobbied harder for Irving to follow him to the Garden. But one former N.B.A. All-Star, who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss his colleagues' plans, said Durant and Irving were already mentioning the Nets' attractiveness as a free-agent alternative to the Knicks before the end of the regular season.
It's a handy reminder that in the modern N.B.A. top players and their representatives take a more active role in team building than ever before. It's an environment in which communicators flourish.
Credit should go to Marks for gradually pulling the Nets out of the muck through a string of savvy moves. Durant and Irving could reach only one conclusion upon assessing the city's two franchises: The Knicks lag behind the Nets on the structure, roster and ready-to-contend curves -- even after the Nets' previous regime essentially surrendered control of the team's first-round draft pick to the Celtics from 2013 to 2018 in an infamously ill-conceived trade.
Yet it's also true that the Nets needed to secure Irving's keen buy-in to then get Durant's. That was the only sure way to persuade Durant, a two-time N.B.A. finals most valuable player, to spurn the security of a five-year, $ 221 million offer to return to the Warriors, and reject strong interest from the Los Angeles Clippers and the now-crestfallen Knicks.
It was Dinwiddie's job to lead the recruiting of Irving. Amid a breakout season in which he averaged 16.9 points and 4.6 assists in 28.1 minutes per game and earned a three-year, $ 34 million contract extension in December, Dinwiddie took advantage of the league's policy not to deem player-to-player discussions as potential tampering violations as long as a player is not acting on directives from the front office.
Of course, even in the Nets' triumph, there is no shortage of skepticism about their future.
Durant faces a daunting road back to health to hush the naysayers who question whether he can return to peak level. Irving was widely pegged as the foremost source of the toxicity in Boston's locker room last season and will be under a microscope in his interactions with teammates and Coach Kenny Atkinson to see how he affects the Nets' vaunted chemistry -- especially in Year 1 while Durant is healing. At the same time, the Nets' new team owner, Joe Tsai, will start his reign in earnest -- and all of these unknowns precede the Nets' seeing how the two outsize personalities will click when Durant returns.
Not that a sage like Thorn, who, at 78, still serves as a special consultant to the Milwaukee Bucks, can comprehend such fretting after the highs, lows and never-ending challenges he endured as a Net.
"The irony of it to me was that both the Knicks and the Nets were after these players," Thorn said. "And the Nets got them.
"Wow."

Texto completo: The solid economy is doing little to bolster support for President Trump.
Americans give Trump mixed reviews for his economic stewardship despite the growth achieved during this presidency, according to a new survey by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.
Nearly two-thirds describe as "good" an economy that appears to have set a record for the longest expansion in US history, with decade-long growth that began under former president Barack Obama. More people consider the economy to be good today than did at the start of the year.
But significantly fewer approve of Trump's handling of the economy, even as it remains a relative strength compared with other issues. The survey indicates that most Americans do not believe they're personally benefiting from his trade policies. And only 17 percent said they received a tax cut, despite government and private sector figures showing that a clear majority of taxpayers owed less after the president's tax overhaul passed in 2017.
These doubts create a possible vulnerability as Trump highlights the economy's solid performance in his campaign for reelection in 2020.
Nearly half of Americans, 47 percent, approve of Trump's handling of the economy, but his overall approval rating — 38 percent — is low compared with what past presidents have enjoyed in strong economic conditions. Only about 4 in 10 Americans approve of his handling of taxes and trade negotiations.
The public skepticism has persisted even as the president routinely congratulates himself on the economy, including the 3.6 percent unemployment rate and stock market gains.

Buttigieg raised $24.8m in quarter, campaign says
Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., raised $24.8 million over the past three months, his campaign said Monday, a head-turning total that is likely to be among the largest disclosed by any of the Democratic presidential candidates for the second quarter of the year.
Buttigieg's haul, from more than 294,000 donors, is the clearest indicator yet of how a candidate who only months ago was little known among voters has become a formidable contender in the race for the Democratic nomination.
Buttigieg had more than 230,000 new donors in the quarter, bringing his total number of donors during his presidential bid to more than 400,000, his campaign said. The average contribution over the course of his campaign has been $47.42, according to his team.
His campaign said it now had more than $22.6 million in cash on hand.

Trump congratulates N.J. on blocking tax on millionaires
President Trump on Monday congratulated New Jersey's Democratic-led Legislature for passing a budget that did not include a proposal by Governor Phil Murphy to raise taxes on millionaires — a move Trump claimed would have driven high earners from the state.
In subsequent tweets, he complained about how "ridiculously high" taxes are hurting his children and businesses in New York.
Murphy, a Democrat, was seeking to raise additional revenue by increasing the top marginal rate paid by those making more than $1 million from 8.97 percent to 10.75 percent. Fellow Democrats, who control both chambers of the state Legislature, balked at the move. On Sunday, Murphy signed a budget bill without the provision.
"Congratulations to legislators in New Jersey for not passing taxes that would have driven large numbers of high end taxpayers out of the state," Trump tweeted Monday morning. "Many were planning to leave, & will now be staying."
Murphy responded in kind later Monday, writing on Twitter: "We all know @realDonaldTrump is fighting for millionaires like himself. I'm fighting for New Jersey's middle class and all those working to get there."

California seriously considers limiting facial recognition technology

Texto completo: When San Francisco banned the use of facial recognition by the city's police and other agencies earlier this year, it was an outlier in the United States. But now several other cities are following suit, and California is considering a limited ban on the technology.
Somerville, a city near Cambridge, Massachusetts, passed a facial recognition ban last week. Oakland, San Francisco's neighbor across the Bay, is on the verge of passing its own measure, which would prohibit the police and other city agencies from deploying the technology.
And a bill in the California Legislature that would ban the use of facial recognition on footage collected by police body cameras appears to be gaining traction.
The legislative forays indicate a groundswell of support for curtailing the technology, which has struggled to correctly identify women and people of color. The error rates and the pervasive passive surveillance that facial recognition can enable are often cited as concerns motivating the bans.
"Facial recognition can be used to track our every movement, supercharge racial profiling and discrimination, target political dissidents, and control nearly every aspect of our lives," Evan Greer, digital rights campaign director at the advocacy group Fight for the Future, said in a statement. "Lawmakers are beginning to agree that this dystopian technology is dangerous."
Somerville's ban, like San Francisco's, builds upon a broader agenda in the city that regulates its use of surveillance technology. Oakland's City Council will most likely vote on its proposed ban this month, while Berkeley is mulling a ban but has not yet scheduled a vote. California's ban for body cameras passed the Assembly in May and is currently winding its way through the Senate.
Some facial recognition companies have criticized the bans, although other technology companies have tried to preempt them with their own moves. Axon, one of the largest suppliers of police body cameras, announced last week that it would forbid the use of facial recognition on its devices, although it had previously made the technology a part of its road map for future business.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – A Navy SEAL was found not guilty on Tuesday of premeditated murder after being charged with killing a teenage Islamic State prisoner in Iraq.
Navy SEAL Edward Gallagher was accused of stabbing a teenage prisoner in the neck and body. He went on to pose with the prisoner's body and included it as a prop in his re-enlistment ceremony, and bragged that he "got this one with my knife. " In addition, he was also accused of shooting two civilians.
Gallagher was found guilty on one of seven charges: posing for a photo with a human casualty. According to CNN, Gallagher faces a maximum sentence of four months. However, he has already served 201 days.
He was found not guilty of premeditated murder, willfully discharging a firearm to endanger human life, retaliation against members of his platoon for reporting his alleged actions, obstruction of justice, and the attempted murders of two noncombatants.
Gallagher had pleaded not guilty to all charges, contending that his accusers, members of his platoon, were "disgruntled subordinates who could not meet his high standards. "

The verdict comes after a tumultuous court-martial.
A SEAL medic who was a key witness initially told prosecutors ahead of the trial that Gallagher had walked up and stabbed the teenage prisoner. The medic said he then tried to revive the prisoner.
However, during the trial, the medic said testified he was the one who killed the teenager, according to the Associated Press. The medic, Corey Scott, testified on June 20 that he suffocated the boy after Gallagher stabbed him, claiming that he did it as an act of mercy. He had previously not told prosecutors that, and his account only changed after he was granted immunity.
In addition, the prosecution had already faced ethics questions ahead of the court-martial, which began in June.
At hearings in May, it was revealed that the prosecution sought to track emails from Gallagher's defense team in an effort to find a leak to the media. Cmdr. Christopher Czaplak, the then-lead prosecutor, and agents of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service sent emails embedded with hidden tracking software to Gallagher's lawyers and a journalist for the Navy Times, according to the New York Times.
Several outlets in May reported that President Donald Trump was considering a pardon for Gallagher. The president in March also moved Gallagher to "less restrictive confinement" due to the "honor of his past service to our country. "

Texto completo: For a while now, the most demanding wing of the progressive movement has been gunning for Thomas Jefferson. Their feeling is that because he was a slave owner, his contributions to the American experiment should no longer be recognized and celebrated. This is, of course, ridiculous.
Anyone trying to quote “all men are created equal” back at Thomas Jefferson is either a fool or a hypocrite. Jefferson lived in different times and different conditions, and it is absurd to judge him by our standards of enlightenment. To paraphrase Isaac Newton, if we have seen further than others, it is because we have stood on the shoulders of giants. And in American history, they don’t come much taller than Thomas Jefferson.
I’m not particularly bothered by this. Despite the judgment of groups like the Democratic Party of New Hampshire, I’m confident that Jefferson’s contributions will stand the test of time. But now this same sort of ahistorical Monday-morning quarterbacking is starting to affect real people in real time.
Biden attacked for view on forced busing
Former Vice President Joe Biden is under attack because in the 1970s, he had the “wrong” position on forced busing. It seems progressives are now in favor of busing. Biden was against it. In their view, this renders Biden out of step with the Democratic Party and is unacceptable in a presidential nominee.
As with their rejection of Jefferson, this completely ignores historical context. In the 1970s, busing was an incredibly contentious and complicated issue with even the most committed liberals — that’s what progressives called themselves then — lined up on both sides. Detroit is a case in point.
Memo to Kamala Harris: Here's why Joe Biden worked with segregationists in the Senate
Coleman Young had impeccable liberal credentials. In 1952, he came to national attention for publicly spitting in the eye of the House Un-American Activities Committee. In 1963, he was elected to the Michigan Senate. In 1969, he became the Senate minority leader, where he helped pass a law that blocked the forcible reassignment of thousands of Detroit students.
Young had one more noteworthy achievement: He became Detroit’s first African-American mayor.
Forced busing divided black people
Forced busing was a divisive issue, even within the black community. In 1971, that bill blocking the reassignment of all those Detroit students passed with the support of all but one member of the Michigan legislature’s Black Caucus. African Americans opposed busing for a variety of reasons. Some were in favor of local control. Some thought the correct solution was providing more resources for primarily black schools. Others were concerned that forced busing often resulted in local schools simply closing down and the students distributed to schools far outside the community.
As the mayor of Detroit, Young continued to oppose forced busing. He even filed a brief opposing a case brought by the NAACP that sought to use busing to integrate the Detroit school system.
Was Mayor Young right? I don’t know. But none of the modern progressives criticizing his position know, either. He dealt with these decisions in real time, addressing the concerns of real people. It was a complicated, messy problem with no perfect solution. It’s incredibly patronizing to claim that people like Coleman Young “didn’t get it,” even with the arrogance of hindsight. When that hindsight ignores a complex and often inconvenient history, it isn’t just patronizing; it’s shameful.
Coleman Young and Joe Biden were both deeply committed to civil rights, integration and equality. They had, however, a different view on the best way to achieve that than do the latest crop of progressive activists. A little humility is called for. For us, forced busing was something we read about in history books. Donald Trump doesn’t even know what it is. But for Young and Biden, it was a lived experience. We can’t say we would have unquestionably come to a different decision had we been in their shoes.
Never Trumper on Job One: I'll vote for almost any Democrat, but lurching left won't beat Trump
There is a grubby and unpleasant political feel to these attacks. On Friday, the Rev. Jesse Jackson criticized Biden’s long-ago opinions on busing, claiming that he was on "the wrong side of history. ” Many progressives know nothing about forced busing except what they’ve read on the internet. But Jackson is old enough to know just how divided the black community was.
Challenge Biden over future, not past
Jackson attended and addressed the 1972 National Black Political Convention in Gary, Indiana, which drew some 10,000 delegates and observers from across the country, according to the Indiana Historical Bureau. The group passed a resolution opposing busing that some of them disapproved so strongly, they walked out, The New York Times wrote.
Jackson himself supported black self-determination and black control over black education back then and gave a rousing speech to that effect, the historical bureau reported, based on accounts from the time. Today he could be the voice of wisdom and experience to explain that busing was difficult and controversial. Sadly, he has chosen not to do it, and our political discourse is poorer for this.
If Biden’s armor is a little scratched and dented, it’s because he has been through the wars. I disagree with many of Biden’s political positions. But I recognize that he came to those positions thoughtfully and in good faith. I also recognize that throughout his career, Biden has been willing to grapple with difficult questions wiser politicians would have avoided. This makes him politically vulnerable. It also makes him a leader.
Democrats have one job in 2020, beating Donald Trump. They aren’t going to accomplish that by having an ideological beauty contest, and they aren’t going to accomplish that by ignoring facts and twisting history to fit a convenient political narrative. If Sen. Kamala Harris or anyone else wants to take down Joe Biden, they need to do it on their visions for the future, not by refighting the battles of decades ago.

Her participation raised eyebrows among administration critics, who said it undermined the national security professionals in the Trump delegation.
“Ivanka Trump is not on the National Security Council — she is not an adviser on the issues being discussed," former ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul told the New York Times.
Amid the criticism, Twitter users also latched onto video of her awkward discussion with several world leaders, Photoshopping her into various other historic and cultural moments.

Texto completo: What did you think of the bunch of socialists you just saw debating onstage?
Wait, you may protest, you didn't see any socialists up there. And you'd be right. The Democratic Party has clearly moved left in recent years, but none of the presidential candidates are anything close to being actual socialists - no, not even Bernie Sanders, whose embrace of the label is really more about branding ("I'm anti-establishment!") than substance.
Nobody in these debates wants government ownership of the means of production, which is what socialism used to mean. Most of the candidates are, instead, what Europeans would call "social democrats": advocates of a private-sector-driven economy, but with a stronger social safety net, enhanced bargaining power for workers and tighter regulation of corporate malfeasance. They want America to be more like Denmark, not more like Venezuela.
Leading Republicans, however, routinely describe Democrats, even those on the right of their party, as socialists. Indeed, all indications are that denunciations of Democrats' "socialist" agenda will be front and center in the general election campaign. And everyone in the news media accepts this as the normal state of affairs.
Which goes to show the extent to which Republican extremism has been accepted simply as a fact of life, barely worth mentioning.
To see what I mean, imagine the media firestorm, the screams about lost civility, we'd experience if any prominent Democrat described Republicans as a party of fascists, let alone if Democrats made that claim the centerpiece of their national campaign. And such an accusation would indeed be somewhat over the top - but it would be a lot closer to the truth than calling Democrats socialists.
The other day The New York Times published an op-ed that used analysis of party platforms to place U.S. political parties on a left-right spectrum along with their counterparts abroad. The study found that the Republican Party is far to the right of mainstream European conservative parties. It's even to the right of anti-immigrant parties like Britain's UKIP and France's National Rally. Basically, if we saw something like America's Republicans in another country, we'd classify them as white nationalist extremists.
True, this is just one study. But it matches up with lots of other evidence. Political scientists who use congressional votes to track ideology find that Republicans have moved drastically to the right over the past four decades, to the point where they are now more conservative than they were at the height of the Gilded Age.
Or just compare the Republicans, point by point, with parties almost everyone would classify as right-wing authoritarians - parties like Hungary's Fidesz, which has preserved some of the forms of democracy but has effectively created a permanent one-party state.
Fidesz has cemented its power by politicizing the judiciary, creating rigged election rules, suppressing opposition media and using the power of the state to reward the party's cronies while punishing businesses that don't toe the line. Does any of this sound like something that can't happen here? In fact, does any of it sound like something that isn't already happening here, and which Republicans will do much more of if they get the chance?
One might even argue that the GOP stands out among the West's white nationalist parties for its exceptional willingness to crash right through the guardrails of democracy. Extreme gerrymandering, naked voter suppression and stripping power from offices the other party manages to win all the same - these practices seem if anything more prevalent here than in the failing democracies of Eastern Europe.
Oh, and isn't it remarkable how blasé we've become about threats of legal persecution and/or physical violence against anyone who criticizes a Republican president?
So it's really something to see Republicans trying to tar Democrats as un-American socialists. If they want to see a party that really has broken with fundamental American values, they should look in the mirror.
But that won't happen, of course. Whoever the Democrats nominate - even if it's Joe Biden - Republicans will paint him or her as the second coming of Hugo Chávez. The only question is whether it will work.
It might not, or at least not as well as in the past. By spending decades calling everything that might improve Americans' lives "socialist," Republicans have squandered much of the accusation's force. And Donald Trump, who was installed in office with Russian help and clearly prefers foreign dictators to democratic allies, is probably less able to play the "Democrats are unpatriotic" card than previous Republican presidents.
Still, a lot will depend on how the news media handle dishonest attacks. Will we keep seeing headlines that repeat false claims ("Trump Says Democrats Will Ban Hamburgers"), with the information that the claim is false buried deep inside the article? Will we get coverage of actual policy proposals, as opposed to horse-race analysis that only asks how those proposals seem to be playing?
I guess we'll soon find out.

Texto completo: The Clippers will have to woo Kawhi Leonard without offering him an opportunity to play with Kevin Durant, according to reports Sunday afternoon by a variety of NBA insiders indicating he will be signing with the Brooklyn Nets, where he will team up with fellow free agent Kyrie Irving.
Durant, who suffered a torn Achilles tendon during the NBA Finals, reportedly will sign with the Nets on a four-year $164 million deal while Irving will sign a four-year $141 million max deal, per multiple reports. Durant is scheduled to make an announcement via the Instagram of his sports-owned business channel The Boardroom.
NBA free agency is scheduled to open officially today at 3 p.m., PT.
A pair of players with Clippers connections – veteran center DeAndre Jordan, a pillar of the Lob City era, and guard Garrett Temple, who joined the team last season after the trade deadline – also reportedly are set to sign with the Nets.
The Clippers will wait to learn the truth of reports that Leonard was going to leave the Toronto Raptors only if he could be assured he’d be playing with a “top-flight free agent.”
The Clippers reportedly had their sights on Durant, for months. In Brian Windhorst’s report for ESPN in December, he broached the possibility of the duo teaming up and noted that the Clippers would be able to create two max slots to allow it to happen this summer.
Of course, even with the cap space, Windhorst equated pulling off the feat to “pulling the sword from the stone.”
Durant, a 30-year-old forward who won two titles with Golden State, went on the record earlier this month to make it clear that he would make his decision independent of any of his peers intentions: “I can’t be recruited.”
Not that the New York Knicks, Warriors and Clippers wouldn’t join the Nets in making their best cases.
Reports were that the Warriors were set to offer Kevin Durant a five-year, $221 max contract, $57 million more than any of his other suitors, and Stephen Curry was going to help deliver the pitch.
The Clippers’ pitch also will include people that Durant is known to admire, including Jerry West, whose 2016 call to Durant is said to have helped persuade him to join the Warriors, and owner Steve Ballmer, who appeared on the second episode of “The Boardroom with Kevin Durant,” an ESPN series that debuted in February.
Furthermore, Durant’s familiarity with the Clippers organization extends to general manager Michael Winger and assistant coach Rex Kalamian, whose tenures in Oklahoma City overlapped with Durant’s.
And Durant, remember, raved about several members of the Clippers this past season, including their then-rookie backcourt of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Landry Shamet.
But, according to reports, the Nets’ offer and the chance for Durant to play alongside his friend Irving proved most enticing.
On Saturday, the New York Times reported Leonard – who also is a target of the Lakers, who cleared cap space this week in order to offer him a chance to play beside LeBron James and Anthony Davis – wants to play with a “top-flight free agent” if he chooses to leave the Toronto Raptors.
The Clippers also are rumored to be among the teams vying for the 76ers’ Jimmy Butler — who also has been linked to the Houston Rockets and reportedly is most interested in playing for the Miami Heat. The 29-year-old wing was mentioned in various reports as another potential option. An excellent two-way player with a drive to win, on paper he seems like a fit for both Leonard and the Clippers.

Texto completo: MÉXICO – Al cumplirse un año de su victoria en los comicios, el presidente de México, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, usa los micrófonos como si fueran bombonas de oxígeno.
El contacto diario con los medios de comunicación es esencial en su forma de gobernar y, por el camino, el mandatario ha dejado algunas frases memorables:
– “Abrazos, no balazos”
Todo un clásico desde la campaña electoral, casi un mantra de cara al público sobre el que levitan sus intenciones de pacificar el país. En contraste, la presencia de la Guardia Nacional -un nuevo cuerpo de seguridad- ha sido vista como una contradicción a esta frase mítica.
– “Me canso, ganso”
Un popular apunte del líder del Movimiento Regeneración Nacional (Morena) que provocó las risas -tanto cariñosas como hirientes- entre los mexicanos. La usa para dejar clara su perseverancia a la hora de conseguir su objetivo de transformar México.
– “Yo tengo otra información”
La favorita del presidente cuando la prensa espeta datos o información contraria a su Gobierno. Con total confianza se le ha visto poner en duda a calificadoras financieras como Moody’s, Fitch Ratings o incluso al prestigioso diario estadounidense The New York Times.
– “La mafia del poder”
Según describe el filósofo esloveno Slavoj Zizek en su libro “En defensa de la intolerancia” (1998), el ejercicio político es auténtico cuando una “no parte” minoritaria pide ser “parte” rebelándose contra el grupo dominante.
En el caso de López Obrador, ese grupo dominante -al que finalmente derrocó- es “la mafia del poder”, un grupo de políticos y empresarios que durante décadas, asegura, controló México.
– “La prensa fifí”
Un término muy usado desde el arranque de legislatura, identificado inmediatamente como los periódicos que califica de conservadores y adversarios del presidente, del izquierdista Morena.
– “Primero los pobres”
“Por el bien de todos, primero los pobres”, exclamó el presidente durante su discurso de investidura en el hemiciclo del congreso de los diputados el 1 de diciembre de 2018.
Toda una declaración de intenciones sobre las prioridades de su Gobierno: eliminar la pobreza es erradicar el resto de males de México. Y que ha repetido en multitud de ocasiones desde entonces.
– “Limpiar las escaleras de arriba a abajo”
Una de las frases más socorridas del mandatario. Hace referencia a la limpieza de las instituciones, empezando por las altas esferas, para acabar con la corrupción que ha dominado el país durante los últimos años.
– “Me producen ternura, ternuritas”
De las más recientes, lanzada a sus adversarios con una media sonrisa entre pícara y retadora desde su bastión en Palacio Nacional.
“Me producen ternura, ternuritas”, dijo el mandatario, cuando manifestó que sentía cierta pena por la labor que ciertos opositores hacen cada día difundiendo calumnias sobre él.
– “No es mi fuerte la venganza”
Ante todo, la paz. Desde que arrancó su mandato, el líder izquierdista ha defendido que no realizará una caza de brujas contra expresidentes o altos funcionarios por presuntos casos de corrupción, y dijo que prefiere hacer borrón y cuenta nueva.
– “No tengo derecho a fallar”
La consciencia de responsabilidad y el enorme peso que asegura que acarrea sobre sus hombros se desprende de esta frase del presidente mexicano.
López Obrador es el primer líder de izquierdas en décadas que gobierna el país, y su ascenso vino a romper la dicotomía existente entre el otrora hegemónico Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI) -que estuvo en el poder casi 70 años- y el Partido Acción Nacional (PAN).
Para López Obrador, no existe la opción de fallar a las más de 30 millones de personas que le entregaron su voto en busca de un cambio

Texto completo: Believe the hype. "Fleishman Is in Trouble" is even better than we were promised. Taffy Brodesser-Akner, a New York Times Magazine writer, brings to her first novel the currency of a hot dating app and the wisdom of a Greek tragedy. The result is a feminist jeremiad nested inside a brilliant comic novel - a book that makes you laugh so hard you don't notice till later that your eyebrows have been singed off.
As the story opens, life sounds like an erotic carnival for Toby Fleishman. A New York doctor newly separated from his wife, Toby has arrived at the age of 41 to discover a city suddenly flush with women who want him. Now. "His phone was aglow from sunup to sundown," the narrator writes, with texts that contained "underboob and sideboob and just straight up boob and all the parts of a woman he never dared dream he would encounter."
Brodesser-Akner demonstrates an anthropologist's thoroughness in her study of contemporary adult dating and its catalog of sexual practices, but her prose, ringing with manic energy, is obscenely funny.
Poor Toby is thrust into a state of constant arousal, punctuated by moments of deep confusion about his impending divorce from a successful talent agent. What should he reveal to his colleagues about the dissolution of his marriage? And most baffling, what should he tell his son and daughter, who find themselves suspended between two homes?
Perhaps every engaged couple should read this book before they tie the knot. With merciless precision, Brodesser-Akner traces the arcing trajectory of doomed affections: the glorious takeoff, the deluded calm, the shrieking descent.
Much of the first section of the novel follows Toby's frantic efforts to sleep with as many women as he can, while locking down a big promotion at the hospital and taking care of his children. You see, Fleishman is in trouble. His estranged wife, Rachel, has stopped returning his calls. She's no longer picking up the kids. Toby doesn't even know where she is. It's just her latest infuriatingly selfish stunt - or at least Toby would have us believe as he recalls one example after another of her lack of affection, her disregard for how much he does to keep their family humming.
So far, so John Updike. But there's something wonderfully contrary going on here.
This entire story is told by Toby's old friend, Libby Epstein. So expansive and intimate is her knowledge of Toby's experience that it's easy to imagine we're hearing the voice of an omniscient narrator. It turns out that, like Brodesser-Akner herself, Libby used to be a writer for a men's magazine, and she's most comfortable expressing herself in expansive profiles of other people. The further we read into this tale of Toby's marital discord, the more we realize that Libby is trying to work out something about her own existential plight.
That becomes more explicit in the novel's final section. Libby's sympathies - and ours - are suddenly unmoored in the conflicting currents of love and resentment. Perhaps Toby is not the long-suffering saint he imagines himself to be. When Libby finally comes out from the margins of this story, she uses Rachel to offer a sustained reflection on the impossible pressures that talented women endure.
I haven't felt this much energy sparking off a novel since Claire Messud's "The Woman Upstairs." Here, in one gut-punching paragraph after another, is the articulate fury of someone who once dared to imagine that her ambition could be expressed and appreciated. Only too late does Rachel realize that "her success made her poison." She's ripped apart by the demands of full-time motherhood and the new requirements of full-time work.
But Brodesser-Akner swings the sword full circle, slicing through the demeaning rules of the patriarchy just as effectively as she slays the fatuous optimism of that "girl-power" propaganda fed to modern girls.
Conveying the full tragedy of that predicament in a story that's often blisteringly funny is the real triumph of this book. Few novels express so clearly that we're all in trouble.

Biden's problem with Dems? He doesn't hate Republicans

Texto completo: Let's get this straight: Joe Biden is leading in the polls for the Democratic presidential nomination because he's the most "electable" candidate in the Democratic field? A guy who doesn't realize that I worked with segregationists isn't a winning message with Democrats in 2020?
This is what you get when you turn to a candidate who has been in Washington for 46 years. Biden was first elected to the Senate in 1972, when the Democratic Party was very different than it is today. As a freshman senator, he had to get along with the senior leadership of his party – which included segregationists James Eastland of Mississippi and Herman Talmadge of Georgia.
You may be thinking: Who in the world are James Eastland and Herman Talmadge? You're not alone. Ninety-nine-point-nine percent of living Americans had either forgotten their names or never heard of them in the first place, until Biden decided to dredge them up from the fever swamps of the Democratic Party's sordid racial past.
Why, you ask, would he do such a thing? Because that's what Joe Biden does. He is a walking, talking gaffe machine. His point didn't even make sense. He was trying to argue that he can work across the aisle with people with whom he fundamentally disagrees. But Eastland and Talmadge sat on the same side of the aisle as Biden in the Senate; they were Democrats.
So now his younger, less popular Democratic opponents are pouncing on Biden's mistake. California Sen. Kamala Harris (averaging 7.1% in the polls) declared that for Biden "to coddle the reputations of segregationists, of people who if they had their way I would literally not be standing here as a member of the United States Senate, is, I think, it's just misinformed and it's wrong."
New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker (2.3%) declared, "Vice President Biden's relationships with proud segregationists are not the model for how we make America a safer and more inclusive place for black people, and for everyone." New York Mayor Bill de Blasio (0.3%) tweeted, "It's 2019 & @JoeBiden is longing for the good old days of 'civility' typified by James Eastland. Eastland thought my multiracial family should be illegal."
Give me a break. No reasonable person thinks that Biden was defending or even sympathetic to segregation. What Biden was trying to do -- in his own, Bideny way -- was to defend not segregation but civility and compromise. But sadly, in today's Democratic Party, those ideas are just as controversial.
Recall that in February, Biden was forced to apologize for declaring -- brace yourself -- that Vice President Pence was a "decent guy." Then, a few months later, Biden had to backtrack on his effort to craft a middle-ground approach to climate change that would be embraced by both environmentalists and blue-collar voters. After Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., thundered, "There is no 'middle ground' when it comes to climate policy," Biden soon embraced the Green New Deal.
And this month, Biden was forced to flip-flop and abandon his four-decade-long support for the Hyde amendment – bipartisan legislation that bars public funding for abortions – after his Democratic opponents attacked him for reaffirming what he once proudly called his "middle-of-the-road" policy on abortion.
Biden has also been forced to apologize for his support for the bipartisan 1994 crime bill, which was signed into law by Democrat Bill Clinton but which Democrats now blame for the mass incarceration of African Americans. "I haven't always been right" on criminal justice, he declared earlier this year.
In today's Democratic Party, "compromise" and "consensus" are dirty words. Biden's problem is not that he is a closet racist; it's that he does not hate Republicans and other political opponents. As he put it on Tuesday, "Today, you look at the other side and you're the enemy. Not the opposition, the enemy. We don't talk to each other anymore." That is the point he was trying to make in his ham-handed way. And that is what his Democratic opponents are really upset about.
In a January speech, Biden said, "I read in The New York Times today that one of my problems if I were to run for president, I like Republicans. Okay, well, bless me, Father, for I have sinned." Apparently, for many on the left, that sin is unforgivable.

Texto completo: HOUSTON -- Jonathan Martinez was standing near an empty cage at the municipal animal shelter here looking dejected. A 25-year-old accountant, he was getting married soon and he and his fiancée wanted to make a dog a part of their new life together. But every time he saw a dog he liked on an online database of lost or abandoned pets, it would be gone by the time he got to the shelter.
Holding up his phone to show screenshots of two adorable terrier mix puppies, Mr. Martinez said, "I saw them when I checked the website this morning but the rescue people took them before the shelter even opened." A shelter employee apologized and told him the rescue group was shipping the puppies to Colorado for adoption.
"Why are they doing that?" Mr. Martinez said. "I'm right here ready to take a dog home right now."
Mr. Martinez is bumping up against an issue that is causing some consternation in the animal welfare community. Over the past 15 years, rescue organizations have shipped millions of shelter dogs from poorer communities in the South to wealthier places in the Northeast, Pacific Northwest and Midwest, where stricter spay and neuter laws have resulted in a dwindling supply.
Relocating rescue dogs "can be a lifesaving thing," said Sandra Newbury, a veterinarian and director of the shelter medicine program at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. After all, overcrowding at shelters puts more animals at risk for euthanasia.
But she worries that things have gotten out of hand. Overzealous rescue organizations and shelters, under pressure to increase their live-release rates, might be harming animals as well as creating barriers to adoption. "Why would you ever put a dog through transport if you could place it in the local community?" Dr. Newbury asked.
The journey can be perilous, especially for puppies and kittens, which are more vulnerable to stress. Some animals have escaped from the vans transporting them and been hit by passing cars. Others have overheated. In May, 26 dogs died from excessive heat in a vehicle owned by the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals while being shipped from Mississippi to Wisconsin.
The practice of transporting shelter animals cross-country really took off in 2005 after Hurricane Katrina. The storm displaced thousands of dogs in New Orleans, and rescue organizations mobilized to ship them to homes in other states. This created supply chains and relationships among animal welfare groups, which can range from an individual with a couple of kennels in the back of a minivan to an organization like the A.S.P.C.A., which has a fleet of 12 custom-made vehicles that can each transport up to 40 dogs.
Animals often go out in weekly shipments from say, Houston to Greenwich, Conn., or from Sacramento to Sun Valley, Idaho. Along the most traveled routes, there are hubs or way stations where animals are walked and fed. Outfits like Wings of Rescue and Pilots N Paws provide air transport.
The transporter may have a heart of gold or just be in it for the money. Shelters and rescue groups sometimes pay transporters to take the dogs on the front end, while others may pay to receive them. Adoption fees can top $ 500, as it is now fashionable to adopt rescue animals. This is in part thanks to the A.S.P.C.A.'s ad campaign pairing heartbreaking images of abandoned and abused animals with Sarah McLachlan singing "Angel." The ads, which began airing in 2007, generated more than $ 30 million for the organization. Moreover, at a time when the news is filled with stories of migrant children in cages, many people may see adopting a rescue pet as an easy way to take feel-good action.
As a result, animal rescue has become a "retail operation," said Greg Damianoff, director of the Bureau of Animal Regulation and Care, Houston's municipal shelter. Rescue groups have been known to duke it out over the most desirable dogs like shoppers over a marked-down Armani gown. "You get a maltipoo in here and you're likely to see a blood bath," he said.
The hot commodities are the smaller, scruffy or fluffy dogs like the puppies Mr. Martinez was after. Shelters bundle loads of these dogs, known as the "cute and cuddlies" or easy-to-flip "flipper puppers," with larger, older Labrador or pit bull mixes that are harder to move.
Mr. Damianoff sees sending off animals that locals may want as the only way to save the less desirable animals in his inventory. His shelter has a capacity of around 300 dogs and sometimes gets as many as 150 in a day. "We're not trying to exclude anyone, but the whole thing is to get the animals out of here alive," Mr. Damianoff said.
But as with many things that start with good intentions, there have been unsettling consequences, chief among them the recent deaths. Even when the animals arrive safely, they can carry parasites like heartworms and deadly diseases like parvovirus and distemper, which then spread not only in the receiving shelters but also to pets in the communities where the rescues are adopted.
Several states, including Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Rhode Island, have imposed more stringent entry requirements for rescue animals, like mandatory examinations by a local vet and quarantines. But these regulations are easy to circumvent. It's not uncommon for rescue groups to take animals to neighboring states to make the handoff or to coordinate adoptions online, animal control officials say, making drops in parking lots in the dead of night.
In addition to relocating animals from less well-off areas of the mainland United States, rescue groups have begun bringing in dogs from China, Egypt, Mexico, South Korea, Thailand and Puerto Rico. United States Customs and Border Protection and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have raised security and public health concerns about this trend. In May, the C.D.C. suspended all imports of dogs from Egypt after several rescue dogs arrived with rabies.
The stress of transport not only makes animals susceptible to disease but can also contribute to behavioral problems. The dogs have often been abused, neglected or feral before they land in a crowded and cacophonous shelter. And then they get loaded onto a truck or airplane and transported hundreds or thousands of miles to another shelter or foster home before they are eventually adopted. A loving home at the end of the line sometimes isn't enough to make up for all that trauma.
"As the years have gone by with the transport system, I started seeing so many unsocialized dogs that were aggressive or scared of their own shadows," said Kelley Bollen, an animal behaviorist in Reno, Nev., who consults with shelters and people who have adopted rescue animals. While some animals are resilient, others are not. "It's heartbreaking to have to explain to people who have just rescued this dog from the South that this animal won't be a normal pet," she said. "I tell them, 'We're going to work really hard to get this animal comfortable in your house with your family, but it's going to be a rough road that's going to take patience, drugs and a lot of understanding."'
All this has led many animal welfare advocates to question the wisdom of "humane relocation" and whether all the money that goes toward marketing, bundling and ferrying animals might be better spent stemming the flow of dogs into shelters in poor communities. Since up to 80 percent of dogs that end up in shelters are surrendered by their owners or turned in as strays, there has been a growing movement to address what's preventing people from caring for their pets.
One example is the nonprofit group Emancipet in Austin, Tex., which focuses on providing free or low-cost spaying and neutering and veterinary services. The group also goes door-to-door to answer people's pet-related questions.
"Ninety-nine percent of people have pets because they love them and will do right by them if given education and the opportunity," said Myles Chadwick, the group's vice president of consulting and training. Emancipet treats some 100,000 animals per year and has contributed to a significant decline in Austin's shelter population.
The influential pet charity Maddie's Fund has recently invested millions in similar programs. It is also working to reduce barriers to adoption, at a time when many rescue groups require something comparable to an F.B.I. background check and spot home inspections. Mr. Martinez said he was put off by the intrusiveness of the several-page application required by a local rescue group. "I was like, 'What is this? We're trying to give a dog a home,"' he said.
Mary Ippoliti-Smith, who serves on the executive leadership team at Maddie's Fund, said, "There are lots of people in our movement making huge value judgments about where animals should go and who should get what, who think poor people or homeless people shouldn't have animals, or families with children or people who work all day shouldn't have animals." That's not fair to the dogs or the people who want to give them a home. "We love animals because of the unconditional love they give back," she added. "Why deny that to anyone? Why would we assume someone's ability to love an animal would be any less than our own?"

America's last hideous man

Texto completo: "I think most people think of rape as being sexy," E. Jean Carroll said this week to CNN's Anderson Cooper. "They think of the fantasies."
Well, maybe not. Plenty of women certainly disagree. But Carroll's refusal to conform to the typical script of the post-#MeToo era is precisely what makes her contribution so compelling - especially as, in a host of other ways, her rendering of her own experience runs parallel to the larger narrative of a country caught up in a reckoning.
Carroll, who accused President Trump of sexual assault in an essay in New York magazine, has written a book called "What Do We Need Men For?" It appears cheeky and, according to "The Daily" podcast from the New York Times, it was initially intended to be even cheekier. But then Harvey Weinstein was exposed as Public Abuser No. 1, and Carroll's lighthearted travels around the country asking women to justify the less-fair sex's existence turned more grim. She could ask other women about men, but first she had to figure out how she felt about those in her own history.
So did the rest of us.
Carroll reflected on a list of men she had encountered in her life and realized that she needed to append an adjective to several: hideous. The country, at the time, was doing the same thing - engaging in a collective catharsis that made its way from the mind to the keyboard to social media sites, where women throughout the country declared that they'd done some thinking and, yes, them, too.
Some of those so-called #MeToo moments were what most of us would call rape. Some were groping, or thigh- touching or other physical violations whose harmlessness it was relatively easy to convince ourselves of. Some were comments, persistent or prurient or both. Women were suddenly looking at their pasts through a new lens, and things weren't rose-colored anymore.
Carroll, as she tells it, got on the phone to two of her friends after Trump pushed her against the wall of a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room, pulled down her tights and inserted his penis inside her. (Trump denies the allegation.) She was laughing as she retold the tale, until she wasn't.
So were the rest of us, laughing, or at least rolling our eyes, when a colleague said something inappropriate or when a boy at college drunkenly grabbed us in a dancing crowd. It had to be a lark, it seems, because if it wasn't a lark it was so horribly sad.
What has always worried people about #MeToo is first that a retrospective cataloguing of the hideousness isn't fair because it's not only women who were looking through a different lens then. It's men, too. How were they supposed to know? People worry, too, about how the revised rules, applied in the future, could punish men who refuse to comply with some draconian code of prudishness. Even consensual encounters, some panicked, would be marred. Sex simply won't be fun anymore.
Carroll's recounting dismantles those concerns. She has done the cataloguing that #MeToo critics so fear, and guess what? Her hideous men are hideous. Of course they were supposed to know. She is still, at times, too forgiving - letting a young boy who himself had been abused off the hook for abusing her, acknowledging her own coquettishness as an excuse for a lecher's lechery, shrugging off what some may feel would have weighed them down for a lifetime.
And the fun of sex? Good Lord, this woman is saying "ravishing" someone is sexy - far, far over any line even the most cautious #MeToo skeptic would venture to draw. Carroll's interest in playfulness comes across in much less polarizing context throughout the essay. It was fine, she suggests, that Trump asked her, an advice columnist, to advise him on picking out lingerie. In fact, it was charming as all get out. She was flattered, she was engaged. "It's a thing," she told "The Daily." "It's a thing."
Carroll's reckoning with her hideous men mirrors our collective reckoning with our own men, from our years of rationalizing bad behavior, to our revelation that we needed to reassess, through the process of reassessing. Her narrative is our collective narrative - and yet she sets so high (or low) a standard for her men to qualify as hideous that all the concerns about overreach start to feel, when we see the arc of the #MeToo movement reflected in her words, just silly. Some worry about going too far, yet we still have so far to go.
Which brings me, as eventually it brought "that advice lady," to the last item on her list of hideous men: Donald J. Trump, then "that real-estate tycoon" and now president of the United States. He's part of our story, too - a hideous man we still have to fight against as hard as Carroll says she did, stomping on him with her six-inch heel to force his 6-foot-3 frame off and away. He's one of those hideous men who, despite his hideousness toward women both alleged and demonstrated, has found reward after reward for failure after failure.
Trump is Carroll's final hideous man. "I never had sex again," her essay jarringly ends. Maybe that is because she is defeated. Or maybe it is because, by deciding she doesn't need men after all, much less hideous ones, she has won. The struggle ahead of America is to make Donald Trump its final hideous man, too.

Texto completo: Nearly six months into the new Congress led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi, I offer some observations:
2019 began with Democrat leadership fully denying the existence of an illegal immigration crisis at our southern border. Democrat leadership allowed a 35-day government shutdown over a refusal to protect our borders. On 17 separate occasions in just over one month, House Republicans have attempted to pass legislation that would provide $4.5 billion in humanitarian assistance, which includes $3.3 billion to fund shelter capacity for unaccompanied children and provide for transportation to safe and efficient border processing centers. This funding is not intended to increase physical border security, which Democrats have long objected to, but rather humanitarian aid. Still, their leadership continues to block this critical funding.
Recent figures are staggering. U.S. Customs and Border Protection announced officers have apprehended or turned back nearly 700,000 migrants in the past eight months. Further, apprehensions in May marked the highest monthly total in 13 years near the southern border, with U.S. authorities detaining or turning away more than 140,000 people - including about 84,000 families and 11,000 minors. Alarmingly, the number of illegal immigrants that have crossed the U.S. border is unknown.
These undeniable facts even led the New York Times editorial board to recently publish a piece encouraging Democrat leadership to finally take action. Instead, they have chosen to prioritize politics over the people. Their goals are crystal clear: They value political messaging that aims to disrupt and resist while choosing to ignore the needs and security of American families.
In fact, this year’s Democrat agenda has focused on policy proposals that incentivize illegal immigration. When debating HR 1, sweeping legislation that alters long-standing national election standards, Democrats refused to support a Republican amendment expressing that illegal immigrants should not be allowed to vote in federal elections. Further, Democrats passed HR 6, which includes various blanket amnesty provisions. These actions are all part of the Congressional record.
On health care, their policy proposals are unsustainable. Their “Medicare for All” bill promises government-run single payer health care for every person, citizen or not, in the United States. This would be facilitated through the elimination of hardworking American’s employer sponsored healthcare and massive tax increases, at a cost estimate of $32 trillion taxpayer dollars. Additionally, Democrat leadership took a bipartisan bill aimed at lowering prescription drug costs and filled it with partisan poison-pill amendments, such as the banning of Association Health Plans and directing hundreds of millions of dollars into Obamacare’s failed Navigator program.
This Congress should be able to work on issues of real importance, like the proposed United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Democrat leadership has failed to consider and ratify USMCA, a trade deal that is crucial to the booming American economy and the manufacturers, fabricators, distributors, retailers, farmers, and other businesses in Pennsylvania’s Ninth District and our country.
House Republicans, and the President, are continuing to focus on the need for a growing economy, a strong national defense including border security, reduced healthcare costs, free and fair trade agreements, revitalizing our stressed communities, regulatory reform, and pro-growth policies which improve the quality of life of American families. Democrats’ political proposals are focused only on the 2020 election. Instead, we need 20/20 vision - a vision with policy and actions that put Americans first.

Texto completo: Brooke Barker says her parents wouldn't let her have any pets. "So I settled for a childhood spent reading everything I could about animals." Among the odd assortment of animal facts she collected:
* Sloths come down from trees just once a month "to use the bathroom."
* Two dogs were hanged for witchcraft in Salem, Mass.
* Emus can't walk backward.
* Fire salamanders eat their siblings.
She paired those facts with witty comments and charmingly drawn illustrations, then put them on Instagram. Her life changed almost overnight.
"Sad Animal Facts" attracted hundreds of thousands of followers and a book offer from a New York City publisher. The book, published in 2016 by Flatiron Books, became a New York Times bestseller and a hot book in Japan, Chile and the United Kingdom. The sequel, "Sad Animal Babies," was published last fall.
Ms. Barker was born 32 years ago at West Penn Hospital, because both of her parents went to college in Pittsburgh. She grew up in Minnesota and earned a degree in French studies from Brigham Young University in Utah.
She has lived in Portland, Ore., and Toronto, was a school teacher in France and worked at an advertising agency in Amsterdam.
Her professional background includes writing scripts for TV commercials and working as a reference librarian, which is "not as thrilling as it sounds," she writes dryly in the introduction of her first book.
Reference librarian "was a pretty slow job in a quiet place, and I passed a lot of time by drawing animals on the backs of old card catalog slips," she wrote.
She and her husband, writer Boaz Frankel, traveled extensively promoting her books, "and we fell in love with Pittsburgh," she said. "People are nice, and I love the hills."
The couple moved to Shadyside in March, and in April they adopted a dog from a local rescue group. Kip "looks like a fox and is probably some kind of terrier mix," Ms. Barker said. "He is very mellow and is a good work companion. He sits quietly in my studio and watches."
Some of the facts in her new book actually are pretty sad, like this one: "A young moose has to leave its parents when they want to have another baby."
The illustration shows a moose dad telling a baby moose: "Your mother and I have some good news and some bad news."
In the back of the book is more information. Alaskan wildlife biologist Kris Hundertmark is quoted as saying that 1-year-old moose "don't know what's going on and don't want to leave." Sometimes they follow the mother and the new baby "from a sad, safe distance."
Ms. Barker and Mr. Frankel have just finished a "couples book" that will be published in December. The title is "Let's Be Weird Together: A Book About Love," and "it will be funny," Ms. Barker promised.

Texto completo: Those who read two weeks ago about Deb Barton's horrific accident, her goals, her recovery, and her preparation for this year's National Senior Games held in Albuquerque and Santa Fe will be inspired to know the results of her dedicated focus on life for the last 18 months. In Albuquerque, Deb earned a silver by being beaten by eight seconds in the 5 kilometer time trial. After counsel with her coach that night, day two revealed a fortified determination that resulted in the gold for the 10K tt. She then, with her coach, developed a plan for the two road races (20K and 40k) to be held on a challenging circuit in Santa Fe two days later and won both with solo breakaways. Although Deb stated that she "... had nothing left at the end," her life-spirit was overflowing with gratitude and satisfaction. Congratulations on a job well done; is the World Senior Games next Dr. Barton?
And now ...
On 06 July, just eight days from now, the 2019 edition of the world's most beautiful sporting event, the Tour de France, will begin in Brussels, Belgium. Why Brussels? To commemorate the 50th anniversary of the sport's greatest champion, Belgium Eddy Merckx, and his first victory in "La Grande Boucle." Merckx's intimidation factor was to become the food of legends and as such, when the mere professional mortals were to start a competition with "The Cannibal" at the front, they were battling for second. Merckx's power was demonstrated with an authority that led to 525 professional victories, many of which were performed as solo acts of aggression. Eddy Merckx would win five Grand Tours de France ('69, '70, '71, '72, '74) and as he was on course to win a sixth, a fan of the leading French competitor jumped out of the crowd and punched him in the back so hard as to inflame his liver and diminish his performance to a second place finish.
There is another Tour de France anniversary that will probably receive little if any notice. Pedal through the years to 1984 for the historic confluence of the efforts of a French race promoter, a burgeoning professional field of female cyclists, and a "Rosy the Riveter" attitude that "we can do it" and enter the first American team of six women who paid their own expenses to represent the world's richest country in a sport that has consistently downplayed female athleticism.
Five other countries would also field teams of six for the inaugural Tour Cycliste Feminin. Of the 36 competitors, 35 would finish the 18 stages permitted by the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI).
The US team had five of its six positions filled and Marianne Martin, a college graduate who suffered from annual early season bouts with anemia, all but dropped to her knees and begged to be allowed the opportunity to ride the great race that she had initially read about only twelve months earlier. When the national coach acquiesced, Martin stated with authority, "Believe me, you won't be disappointed."
The American media paid little attention to the women's race as the attitude shared by many was reflected in a statement by the defending men's champion, Laurent Fignon, when he said, "I like women, but I prefer to see them doing something else." The New York Times inked a few pre-race words of necessity and didn't print another word until Stage 12, the first in the Alps.
As a native of Colorado, Martin had developed her climbing prowess on many of her home state's above 10,000 foot mountain passes and was prepared for the summit assaults. She attacked on the two categorized climbs to finish over 90 seconds ahead of the competition climbing to second overall. The Times came alive that night; an American had become a contender.
Martin continued her strong ascending and captured the "Malliot Jaune," the Yellow Jersey (which is celebrating its one hundredth anniversary this year), on Stage 14 and never lost it to win the most prestigious event in women's cycling history. In Paris Martin stood shoulder to shoulder (almost!) on the podium with Laurent Fignon, the men's champion. When they stepped off the podium the financial Hydra revealed the inequity of the sport.
Fignon earned $225,000 for his three weeks of work and had no expenses as a sponsored professional. Martin earned $1,000 and like the other women on the US team, paid her own expenses, which took her two years to pay for working her "day job."
This year's La Course by Le Tour de France (the title is as long as the 74 mile event is short!) will feature the women's professional teams competing before the men's Stage 13 time trial, on a circuit of five laps with one climb per lap for a total of 120 kilometers. But there's more!
This year, 13 competitive female cycling ambassadors received UCI recognition and approval to ride every stage of the Tour one day before the men's competition for the entire three weeks. The event is in its fourth year to promote the return of a full-fledged, professional women's Tour. Will the media offer air time for these courageous women? I hope so.
Marianne Martin was a true cycling pioneer who demonstrated the indomitable, priceless American spirit who, with her team mates, proved that women can also provide the same high speed excitement as the men. As one author states, "... she loved the sport, loved the opportunities it gave her, and she had the grit to fight her way to success."
It has been said that for every stage of the race there is a story. I would like to change that parlance to for every stage of the Tour there will be 176 stories for without the riders there are no inspirational stories.
Enjoy France and I'll be back in August.

Trump has avoided talking about Kamala Harris. Will that change after her debate performance?

Resumen: Donald Trump has avoided trash-talking California Sen. Kamala Harris, but that may change after her performance in the Democratic presidential debate.

Enlaces: https://upfinder.upf.edu/openurl/34CSUC_UPF/34CSUC_UPF:VU1?genre=article&amp;atitle=Trump+has+avoided+talking+about+Kamala+Harris.+Will+that+change+after+her+debate+performance%3F&amp;author=Collins%2C+Michael%3BFritze%2C+John&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;date=2019-06-28&amp;rft.btitle=&amp;rft.jtitle=USA+Today+%28Online%29&amp;issn=&amp;isbn=&amp;sid=ProQ%3Anorthcentralnews_

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump seldom passes up an opportunity to trash-talk Democratic presidential hopefuls Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, or, as he calls them, "Sleepy Joe” and “Crazy Bernie. ”
But Kamala Harris has so far been spared the same level of presidential scorn, vitriol and name-calling.
That will probably change following Harris’ solid performance in Thursday night’s Democratic presidential debate.
In just two hours, Harris not only managed to cast doubt on Biden’s front-runner status, but the California senator also dominated much of the debate and established herself as a formidable contender for the party’s nomination for the presidency.
In doing so, she likely made herself a prime target for a presidential attack.
“Trump has not gone after Harris so far because she has not been polling as well as Biden, Sanders and (Elizabeth) Warren,” said Lauren Wright, who teaches courses on the American presidency and women and politics at Princeton University.
While he has shown no qualms about going on the attack against some women – Hillary Clinton, Nancy Pelosi and Warren are all favorite targets – Harris hasn't been on his list.
Criticizing a woman could be dangerous ground for Trump, given his past treatment of women and his past comments that are widely regarded as sexist, Wright said.
“I would not be surprised if he started criticizing (Harris) now that she is inching forward,” she said.
Steering clear of Harris
At this stage in the 2020 campaign, Trump has steered a wide path around Harris even as he has relentlessly attacked candidates polling better than her – and some who are not polling as well.
He dubbed South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg “Alfred E. Neuman” after the Mad magazine character.
The president has tweeted about Biden nearly two dozen times since last year’s midterm election but has not posted anything about Harris from his main Twitter account.
When the White House slammed Harris on immigration last summer, aides did so from the official @WhiteHouse account rather than the @realDonaldTrump account the president uses most often.
Trump regularly calls out Sanders at his rallies and has gone after former congressman Beto O’Rourke for losing his Texas Senate election last year. But a review of his rally transcripts shows the president has not mentioned Harris once as he speaks to supporters across the country.
In an April interview, Trump told Fox News that Harris has “a little bit of a nasty wit,” but that’s about as far as he’s been willing to go in his criticism. Months earlier, he told the New York Times that Harris might be the “the toughest” candidate in the Democratic field.
“I just think she seemed to have a little better opening act than others,” Trump said.
Following Thursday’s debate, Trump went after Biden and Sanders, tweeting from Japan, where he is attending the G-20 summit, that neither had a good day and that “one is exhausted, the other is nuts. ” He never mentioned Harris.
Trump’s campaign, which posted several tweets critical of Harris on Thursday night, did not respond to questions about the president’s strategy on Harris.
Harris was leading Trump 49% to 41% in a Quinnipiac University nationwide poll this month before the debate. Biden and Sanders had only slightly smaller leads over the president.
Commanding the debate stage
In Thursday’s debate in Miami, Harris commanded the stage for much of the night as she and nine other Democratic hopefuls sparred and talked policy for two hours. The event was the second round of a two-part debate.
In one of the debate’s defining moments, Harris ripped into Biden, calling out the former vice president for his nostalgic remarks about working with segregationist senators and for his opposition to school busing in the 1970s.
More: Biden's image as the inevitable nominee, the one to beat Trump, was dinged Thursday
Earlier, when the debate devolved into a shouting match, Harris tried to restore order, telling her fellow candidates: “America does not want to witness a food fight. They want to know how we're going to put food on their table. ”
Harris “took charge and looked like the leader in several key instances,” Wright said. “Launching an attack on a competitor in the midst of the debate and pulling it off is very difficult. It takes practice, timing, and a degree of confidence and comfort in a high-pressure situation. ”
But there also may be a downside.
More: After clash with Kamala Harris, Joe Biden pushes back on race criticism
Harris’ debate performance not only put the spotlight on her but also will focus greater attention on some of the positions that she and other Democrats have taken. While some of those positions on issues such as health care, immigration and abortion appeal to the Democrats’ left flank, they could be a tougher sell in a general election and could cause problems for Harris in a race against Trump.
Harris’ vulnerabilities “are the same as the rest of the top contenders,” said Scott Jennings, a Republican strategist and political commentator.
Harris and the other Democratic presidential hopefuls have “all endorsed taxpayer-funded health care for illegal immigrants, policies that are effectively open borders, taxpayer-funded abortions (even for transgendered females) and tax increases on working Americans to pay for all of it,” said Jennings, who worked in the White House under President George W. Bush.

Fodder for a Trump attack line
For Trump, Jennings said, the attack line will be simple: “Harris would raise your taxes to pay for illegal immigrants to have a better health care plan than you. ”
Whether the Democratic nominee is Harris or someone else, Trump will probably end up treating them “virtually the same as they’ve all signed on to the same basic agenda,” Jennings said.
“I’m stunned at how unaware these Democrats are in understanding how these positions will play in the Pennsylvania, Michigan, or Wisconsin suburbs,” he said. “There’s no walking any of this back now. It’s all out there for the world to see. ”

Like his first opera, "Champion," composer Terence Blanchard's jazz-infused "Fire Shut Up in My Bones" takes on a true story of trauma and reconciliation.

Texto completo: She entered the race as a long shot candidate, a 31-year-old public defender seeking to outrun her odds despite facing far more established candidates.
But Tiffany Cabán's progressive candidacy quickly gained momentum, national attention and donations from afar.
The Democratic primary for Queens district attorney won't likely be officially decided until next week, after absentee and affidavit ballots are counted. But as of now, Ms. Cabán, a public defender and political novice, holds a narrow lead over Melinda Katz, the Queens borough president. If she maintains her roughly 1,100-vote lead, Ms. Cabán will be the heavy favorite in November's general election.
Ms. Cabán's possible win has been likened to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's surprising primary victory last year over the powerful Democratic incumbent, Joseph Crowley, and the two share some similarities.
Ms. Ocasio-Cortez's rise, from bartender to the House of Representatives, is now well known. Here are five takeaways from Ms. Cabán's surprising emergence during the campaign.
Her run was motivated by her work as a public defender
Ms. Cabán has, for the past seven years, worked as a public defender in Manhattan, where she said she saw overzealous prosecutions and the flaws in the criminal justice system. She was encouraged by friends to enter the race. In a questionnaire, she said she decided to do so because "I am frustrated and infuriated by the system."
She has said she would increase funding for programs that provide alternatives to incarceration, like drug treatment and mental health counseling. She would also halt the office's pursuit of crimes like fare evasion, drug possession and loitering, the kind of minor "broken-windows" offenses that have been criticized by activists calling for an overhaul of the criminal justice system.
She has called Rikers Island, New York's largest jail complex, "the biggest mental-health hospital in the city."
She identifies as "a proud queer Latina"
Ms. Cabán was born in Richmond Hills, Queens, and now lives in Astoria. Ms. Cabán, 31, received a bachelor's degree from Penn State University and a law degree from New York Law School. She spent four years working for New York County Defender Services and the Legal Aid Society's criminal defense practice.
During the campaign, she focused on her working-class roots. Her father worked as an elevator mechanic and her mother as a caretaker for children -- both were raised in the Woodside Houses, a public housing complex in Queens.
In a campaign video, Ms. Cabán said her background has helped shape her career. "I'm a queer Latina from a working-class family," she said in the video. "People like us are exactly who the system is trying to keep down. That's why I became a public defender: to defend my community."

She was endorsed by major liberal politicians, like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren
But the endorsement that has gotten the most attention was from Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, the youngest woman elected to Congress, who has emerged as a megawatt figure in Democratic Party politics and a magnet for scorn from conservatives.
Her endorsement of Ms. Cabán helped bring national attention to the campaign and elevated Ms. Cabán's profile.
"Our criminal justice system needs to change," Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said in a statement during the campaign explaining her endorsement. "New Yorkers deserve a seat at the table, and a champion who will fight to realign our priorities toward equal treatment under the law. If Tiffany Cabán wins, things are going to change."
Ms. Cabán is the latest "reformer" to pursue a district attorney seat
Candidates who have sought to change the criminal justice system from the inside have succeeded in prosecutor races in such places as Boston and Philadelphia. (Larry Krasner, in Philadelphia, and Rachel Rollins, in Boston, both endorsed Ms. Cabán.)
Ms. Cabán's campaign has been regarded as an extension of the trend, and Mr. Krasner, who was elected in 2017 after a career as a criminal defense lawyer who focused on civil rights cases, campaigned with her in Queens.
Ms. Cabán told The New Yorker that she had closely watched Mr. Krasner's campaign. "The things that he was running on -- everybody wanted to call it radical reform," she told the writer Jennifer Gonnerman. "What you learn doing the work if you're a public defender, or if you're part of the communities affected by our justice system -- it's common sense."
Her fledgling campaign survived bumpy moments
Ms. Cabán operated with far less financial support than her leading opponents, Ms. Katz and Greg Lasak. At one point, the campaign reported having less than $ 1,000 in the bank and some former staff members complained about delays in their pay, the independent news site The City reported last month.
In March, she took a leave of absence from her public defender job, causing her, she told The New Yorker, to lose her health insurance.
But by June, her campaign had hit its stride. She took in an avalanche of small cash contributions from around the country: Only about 15 percent of the $ 450,000 given to Ms. Cabán in individual donations came from people who listed an address in Queens, according to an analysis by The New York Times of her filings dating back to January. About 45 percent of her contributions came from outside of New York City. Nearly $ 100,000 came from California.

Mystery Buyer of Caravaggio Is an American Billionaire

Texto completo: The American billionaire hedge fund manager and art collector J. Tomilson Hill is the mysterious buyer of an early 17th-century canvas billed as a rediscovered masterpiece by Caravaggio, according to a person with knowledge of the sale.
The painting, "Judith and Holofernes," depicts a scene from the Old Testament's Book of Judith in which a Jewish widow saves her besieged city by tempting and then beheading an Assyrian general.
The unsigned artwork was estimated to sell on Thursday in Toulouse, France, for at least $ 110 million, the highest auction price ever achieved for any artwork in Europe. But on Tuesday, the auctioneers Marc Labarbe and Eric Turquin announced that the painting had sold to a collector outside France and that the auction had been canceled.
That collector is Mr. Hill, who recently retired as a vice chairman of the private equity firm Blackstone and who has amassed a noteworthy collection of Modern and contemporary art as well as old masters. Mr. Hill serves on the board of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and in February opened his own private museum, the Hill Art Foundation, in Chelsea. The Foundation's first show featured the contemporary artist Christopher Wool (Mr. Hill owns 14 of his paintings). Mr. Hill was unavailable for comment.
How much Mr. Hill agreed to pay for the artwork will not be disclosed under the terms of a confidentiality agreement surrounding the purchase. The auctioneers said earlier this week that the price was more than the planned auction's minimum bid of 30 million euros, or about $ 34 million.
The painting is expected to be lent to a major institution such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., or the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles.
Mr. Hill, who goes by Tom, and his wife, Janine, the director of fellowship affairs at the Council on Foreign Relations, have lent much of their collection to major institutions over the years. Their significant collection of bronzes was featured in an exhibition at the Frick Collection in 2014. More recently, the Hills lent their Florentine Renaissance masterwork, "Portrait of a Young Man in a Red Cap," by Jacopo Pontormo, to the Uffizi Gallery and the Pitti Palace in Florence, Italy; the Morgan Library & Museum and the Getty.
Mr. Labarbe, an auctioneer based in Toulouse, found "Judith and Holofernes" in an attic there. Mr. Turquin, a specialist dealer in old masters based in Paris, who collaborated with Mr. Labarbe for the sale, conducted five years of painstaking research, determining it to be a long-lost Caravaggio masterpiece. (Mr. Turquin, contacted by email, declined to comment on the sale.)
The painting is not without complications, given the ongoing debate about its authenticity. Cataloged as having been made in Naples in about 1607, it has been viewed by a number of specialists at the Pinacoteca di Brera museum in Milan in 2016 and 2017. "The touch of the brush screamed out Caravaggio," the museum's director, James Bradburne, told The New York Times.
Among those who have confirmed the painting's authenticity are Keith Christiansen, the chairman of European paintings at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Mr. Christiansen said in a report that the picture was "fully consistent with the work of Caravaggio," except for one area where the execution was untypical, suggesting the possible "intervention of a second hand."
Similar questions have been raised about "Salvator Mundi," the reputed and rediscovered masterpiece by Leonardo da Vinci, which Christie's sold in 2017 to a close ally of a Saudi prince for $ 450.3 million, the highest price paid for a work of art at auction.
The Caravaggio was shown at Colnaghi gallery in London in February, at Kamel Mennour gallery in Paris in April and at Adam Williams Fine Art gallery in New York in May.
If it is indeed by Caravaggio, the painting would become one of just six by the painter -- out of a total of 69 -- in private hands.
"I think it was begun by Caravaggio and finished by another artist," said Fabrizio Moretti, a leading old masters dealer in London. Because fully authenticated works by the artist are exceptionally rare, he added, "it's the most important painting associated with Caravaggio to have appeared on the market for 20 years."

*Correction appended.
WASHINGTON, D.C. — Amid a raging nationwide debate over the dire conditions of migrant detention centers, the U.S. House and Senate rushed to pass legislation this week to address a crisis at the U.S-Mexico border.
The Democratic-controlled House and the Republican-controlled Senate initially approved separate bills with about $4.5 billion aimed at improving conditions in overcrowded migrant detention centers. The bills proposed allocating money differently and offered different levels of assurance that the Trump administration puts the appropriations to their intended use.
But as calls to address the humanitarian situation at the border grew, leaders in both chambers were on a collision course as they scrambled to address the situation ahead of a weeklong July 4 recess. The House ultimately passed the Senate's version, which now heads to President Donald Trump, who is expected to sign it. Here's a look at how the bills compared.
What’s in the Senate Bill?
The Senate bill that the House ultimately approved with no changes pushes billions toward alleviating the pressures on detention centers and providing emergency humanitarian aid to migrant children. That version of the bill comes with far fewer restrictions on the implementation of its funds.
The language in the Senate bill is the product of a fairly robust bipartisan effort, and it passed the upper chamber by a resounding 84-8 margin with the support of the Senate's two Texans — Republicans John Cornyn and Ted Cruz. It passed the House in 305-102.
The vast majority of the Senate's legislation is aimed at alleviating the squalid conditions detained migrant children are facing. It sends $2.9 billion to restore the waning resources of the Department of Health and Human Services.
The majority of the remaining funding — some $1.3 billion — will go to the Department of Homeland Security. The bulk of this appropriation is designated for Customs and Border Patrol to improve the conditions in border facilities, expand medical care, and provide better access to essential items like clothing, hygiene products and baby formula. According to The New York Times, these improvements would not include more beds at detention facilities.
Among the provisions in the Senate bill that originally met resistance in the House was $145 million allocated to the Department of Defense to fund military expenses along the border, including facility maintenance, medical assistance and surveillance and enforcement operations. Democrats sought to keep the Pentagon out of any border aid efforts.
Also drawing pushback on the House side were appropriations in the Senate bill for enforcement, including more than $200 million in funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement and $110 million in overtime funding for Customs and Border Protection employees.
What was in the House bill?
Only three Republicans supported the House's original version of the bill, including one Texan, Will Hurd of Helotes. The funding designations of the House bill were carefully crafted to funnel appropriations towards improving conditions at detention facilities and extending aid and legal services to migrants.
Most of the House's appropriations — some $2.9 billion — would have gone to the Department of Health and Human Services to fund legal services for migrant children who have been detained and to relieve overcrowding by creating more licensed facilities to hold migrant children.
And of the remaining $1.5 billion in the House bill, the majority would have gone to the Department of Homeland Security, a sprawling network of agencies that includes U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
But the House bill was careful to spell out how the Department of Homeland Security would have been allowed to use the new funding, requiring the agency to ensure it has an adequate supply of necessities like food, water, blankets, soap, toothpaste and diapers. Extreme shortages of such products have stoked widespread outrage and served as a flashpoint in the national conversation about the situation at the border over the last week.
Still, nearly $800 million of Department of Homeland Security funding in the House bill was designated for the expansion of “soft-side and modular facilities” — the overflow shelters often referred to as “tent cities” — an expansion of detention accommodations that critics have argued are inhumane.
Unique to the House bill was $17 million in allocations to the Department of Justice prescribing legal services for children and $20 million to ICE to fund alternatives to physical migrant detention centers.
Several provisions added to the House bill in the hours before it passed were aimed at appeasing holdout members of the Congressional Hispanic and House Progressive caucuses. These amendments would have established even tighter restrictions on the use of humanitarian aid funding and stringent standards on the care and resources provided to detained children, including a 90-day limit on the detention of unaccompanied children at influx shelters, demands that U.S. Customs and Border Protection adopt higher standards of medical care and hygiene for unaccompanied children, and a guarantee of translation services and legal assistance for detainees.
The biggest differences
The two chambers were furthest apart on how much leeway to give the Trump administration with this new funding. Perhaps the most significant distinction in the House bill were the “guardrails,” as some members have called them — provisions intended to prevent the misappropriation of funds by ICE and the Trump administration. Republicans argued that these restrictions on implementation would severely limit the ability for the Trump administration to administer a unilateral response in an emergency situation. Those so-called guardrails were aimed at preventing the White House from redirecting appropriations away from humanitarian aid and toward immigration enforcement programs.
According to U.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar of El Paso, who emerged as a lead proponent for the lower chamber's version of the bill, the most important of these safeguards was a prohibition on the use of funds for anything other than their designated purpose.
“We cannot give a president like this a blank check. It just would be disastrous,” Escobar told the Tribune on Wednesday. “We’ve seen him use funding in order to foment chaos and, really, to implement cruelty.”
The House bill was also far more specific in how some of the funds — especially those going to the Department of Homeland Security — could have been spent, down to granular notes about what should be spent on toiletries.
And the House bill also made it easier for lawmakers to check on the detention facilities. The Senate bill says that members of Congress may visit detention facilities with two days advanced notice, while the House bill would have let them show up at detention facilities unannounced.
But ultimately Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi opted to pass the Senates version after failing to bring together the more liberal and centrist members of her party.
“In order to get resources to the children fastest, we will reluctantly pass the Senate bill,” Pelosi wrote in a letter to Democratic lawmakers, according to The New York Times.
Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated the vote by which the Senate passed its border aid bill. The vote was 84-8.

'Sea change' in Queens? Cabán declares victory, Katz doesn't concede

Texto completo: Tiffany Cabán may have proved that last year's election of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wasn't a fluke.
The public defender declared victory in the Queens district attorney race Tuesday, June 25, ending the night with 39.6 percent of the vote and Queens Borough President Melinda Katz tailgating her at 38.3 percent. Greg Lasak, who the Queens Bar Association declared the most qualified for the position, got 14.5 percent of the vote. Mina Malik got 3.9 percent. Over 99 percent of the vote had been counted going into Wednesday morning.
The winner of the primary is more than likely to win the general election in November. The winner will take the place of former Queens District Attorney Ricnard Brown, who passed away in May.
Katz, however, said she's waiting for the remaining 3,400 paper absentee and affidavit ballots to be counted before she declares anything. Nevertheless, Cabán took to Twitter to thank everyone who helped her during her campaign.
"We have built the most powerful, the most diverse, the most beautiful coalition that a borough-wide race has ever seen," said Cabán. "From formerly incarcerated folies to sex workers to undocumented immigrants to community-based organizations & activists to local & national elected officials."
Katz had the backing of many unions, being endorsed by the likes of 32BJ SEIU, CWA Local 1180, TWU Local 100, 1199 SEIU and the United Federation of Teachers. Many pundits looked at the Queens borough president as the favorite once she announced her desire to run. New York State Gov. Andrew Cuomo also threw his weight behind Katz's campaign.
But Cabán received the endorsements of Ocasio-Cortez, presidential candidates Bemie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, the New York Times and the Working Families Party. New York Working Families Party Director Bill Lipton isn't waiting for the paper ballots and took a proverbial victory lap.
"We have a criminal justice system that lets the rich off easy and cracks down hard on poor people, people of color and immigrants," said Lipton in a statement. "But there has been a sea change in America on the politics of criminal justice. Tonight is more proof that the era of chest-beating 'tough on crime' is over. The era of a criminal justice system that sees success as locking up as many undesirables as possible is over. The era of mass incarceration is over.
"Tonight's victory is most cf all a victory for the humanity of those at the margins of society that have been criminalized and incarcerated for no good reason," Lipton continued. "This is a victory for people who want to see a criminal justice system with justice and safety for all." Lipton also noted that the Working Families Party spent, in total, $250,000 in support of Cabán's candidacy.
Gabán campaigned on a platform that would push back against racist law enforcement, end mass incarceration, rely on community-centered solutions to problems and decriminalize sex work. VOCAL-NY Action Fund Co-Executive Director Alyssa Aguilera said that Cabán's potential victory would be a "seismic shift" from the tough-on-crime era of prosecution that has destroyed Black and Brown and lowincome communities.
"We are ecstatic and relieved that Ms. Cabán won, and that many fewer of our neighbors and loved ones will experience the trauma and pain of incarceration," stated Aguilera. "Ms. Cabán ran on a platform that unapologetically centered Black, Brown, poor, trans, undocumented and migrant communities. She worked directly with sex workers, drug users, the homeless and the formerly incarcerated to devise polices that best met their needs."
3ut not all were looking forward to a sea change in Queens. Local conservatives, in language similar to anti-Bill de Blasio sentiment during his first mayoral run, said that Cabán's policies would send New York back to the "bad old days" of crime from the 1970s and 1980s.
"Tiffany Cabán's election should send shivers down the spine of every commonsense New Yorker who believes in civil obedience and the rule of law," said NYGOP Chairman Nick Langworthy. "While she proudly ushers in a new era of lawlessness that protects criminals, law-abiding taxpayers will have no voice and no justice. Her dangerous policies will send Queens on a path back to the bad old days and New York Republicans will be there, orxe again, to clean up the disaster."
Cabán wants Queens to be a new model for the world in how to tackle crime. She wants to end cash bail, raise the charge standard for misdemeanors and use the office's discretion to not charge sex workers and recreational drug users of crimes. Color of Change ???, the political action committee of the nation's largest online racial justice group, released a statement declaring Cabán's victory a victory for the people.
'Tiffany Cabán ran a successful grassroots campaign that centered racial, social and economic justice. Her historic victory is further proof that people in Queens will no longer accept 'business as usual' when it comes to the broken criminal justice system.

It is hard to believe that 10 years ago on June 25, 2009, Michael Jackson went on to glory. Long before Black Lives Matter, Change.org and the Marriage Equality movement, we saw the King of Pop championing social justice issues. In fact, his moniker should have been Social Justice Leader. Michael was not afraid to push the envelope when he took on controversial social issues in an effort to bring the world's attention to them. Twenty-fcur years ago on June 16, 1995, the musical phenomenon released his album, ' HIStory: Past, Present, and Future," which debuted the iconic song "They Don't Care About Us." Although haters and critics tried tc defame the lyrics, Michael set tnem straight when he gave the New York Times a statement saying, "The song :n fact is about the pain of prejudice and hate and is г way to draw attention :o social and political problems. 1 am the voice of the accused and the attacked. I am the voice of everyone."
According to the HOLLYWOOD REPORTER, Tyler Perry has se: jp a new project at Viacom as part of his multiyear content partnership with the media behemoth. The multihyphenate has landed a straight-to-scries order for the White House drama "The Oval" at Viacom-owned cable network BET. The project, starring Ed Quinn and Kim Moore as the first couple, is one of two dramas, two comedies and a live-holiday ".herned production set to air on BET between October 2019 and September 2020. Said Ferry in a statement, "I've been hard at work in 'The Oval' and can't wait to share this story with audiences."
One day after receiving a Lifetime Achievement Award and putting on an epic performance on June 23 at the BET Awards, Mary J. Blige is celebrating the 25th anniversary of her classic album, "My Life," with the debut of her own lipstick, French Silk. The queen of hip-hop and soul has teamed up with MAC Cosmetics to create the shade, which is nude. Said Blige, "The campaign is all about me loving me and finding myself." Blige is also getting ready to head out on tour with Nas.
On June 22, Hollywood Unlocked honored several influencers during its inaugural Hollywood Unlocked Social Impact Brunch. The lavishly decorated event took place at the Sunset Room in Hollywood. Honorees in attendance were Teyana Taylor, Angela Yee and Melyssa Ford. Additional honorees acknowledged during the program were Tiffany Haddish, Cardi B, Floyd Mayweather, Nick Cannon, Karen Clark Sheard and the late Nipsey Hussle. The event was cohosted by HU founder Jason Lee and comedian/actress B. Simone.

Student Reporters Can Serve Their Communities When Administrators Aren’t in the Way

Texto completo: ProPublica Illinois is an independent, nonprofit newsroom that produces investigative journalism with moral force. Sign up for our newsletter to get weekly updates written by our journalists.
Since last year, we have been answering ProPublica Illinois reader questions about how we do our work. Thoughtful, challenging questions have been rolling in ever since, and we’ve been answering them in an occasional series of columns. In this edition, web producer Vignesh Ramachandran answers a question about student media.
I write for my school newspaper and often the topics we want to write about have to go through many levels of school administration in order to be approved. Is there a similar process in real-world journalism publications such as yours? — Arysha Madhani
Not exactly.
Most professional news organizations, like ProPublica, are editorially independent from any external oversight. Donors have no say in what we cover. We pursue and publish the stories that we think are important, that best serve our mission and that best serve you, our audience.
Our Illinois reporters, who find story ideas in all sorts of places, as Jodi S. Cohen has explained, typically put together detailed pitch memos for our editor-in-chief, Louise Kiernan, and our deputy editor, Steve Mills, who then vet the ideas. There might be some back and forth to focus a story. But when it’s approved, it’s full steam ahead into reporting and writing.
That process might look similar for student media at public colleges and universities, where the buck often stops with student editors-in-chief who exercise editorial discretion. A faculty adviser might provide consulting when asked by student journalists. But the law is clear, according to Mike Hiestand, senior legal counsel at the Student Press Law Center: Administrators at public colleges and universities can’t legally stop publication unless a story is unlawful or would create a physical disruption, like a riot, on campus.
At private colleges and universities, administrators “generally have much more authority to directly censor content,” Hiestand said in an interview. Administrators at some schools understand student journalists’ role on campus, while others regard the school paper as an extension of the public relations office.
But sometimes, control can come down to a paper’s funding source. Schools that fund papers sometimes pressure or threaten to cut funding when they’re not happy with coverage, while those that are independently funded often are freer from oversight.
An excerpt from a 2016 joint statement published by the American Association of University Professors, the College Media Association, the National Coalition Against Censorship and the Student Press Law Center. (Via American Association of University Professors website)
Hiestand said in a later email that, in some cases, courts have made clear that there are lines universities can’t cross: “There was a big case out of Minnesota many years ago where a public university tried to get creative with changing the student activity fee system in a way that had a negative impact on a paper. ... The court made clear that the school could not do indirectly (change the funding structure to punish/negatively affect the paper) what they could not do directly (pull the paper off the racks or otherwise physically censor).”
At the high school level, “prior review” and “prior restraint” — mandatory reading or blocking a story before publication — are part of doing business, he added. Student journalists at a Northern California high school recently resisted administrators who wanted to review a profile before publication of an 18-year-old classmate in the adult entertainment industry. In early May, the students went ahead and published the story anyway. The school had threatened to discipline or even dismiss the paper’s faculty adviser, according to The Washington Post.

Thank you to everyone who has supported The Bruin Voice through this time of hardship. The Voice shall not be silenced! The following are publications covering our story.
— The Bruin Voice (@bchsbruinvoice) April 26, 2019
At professional news organizations like ProPublica and ProPublica Illinois, our regional newsroom, any form of prior review and prior restraint by anyone but our newsroom staff will get our lawyers’ attention. When a Cook County judge barred us from disclosing details about a case at the center of a story we were reporting about the state’s child welfare agency, we challenged the order in court because we believe prior restraint by the government is a violation of our First Amendment rights.
Sometimes, newsrooms hold a story or withhold information in the interest of national security. The U.S. Navy recently asked The New York Times not to publish the names of some SEAL team members in a story about a platoon leader accused of war crimes, citing the unit’s covert work. The Times named some team members, but not those who were not already identified in court records.
In student media, Hiestand sometimes sees colleges exercising “creative censorship.”
“So instead of going and just pulling a story from a paper, which they can’t do (in public colleges) and they won’t do, they will go after an adviser’s job … as a way to kind of get to the students and to retaliate against them,” he said.
That can be a tough reality when you’re a student publication and your biggest beat is the school itself.
Here in Illinois, student journalists at Loyola University Chicago, a private school, recently highlighted how the university’s marketing and communication team has been blocking them from getting access to campus sources by insisting the Loyola reporters go first to a university spokesperson.
The students characterized the policy tactics as “straight out of the Trump playbook.”
After those very public complaints, Loyola administrators finally began changing course. The university, which says it treats the Loyola Phoenix “like any other professional media outlet,” convened a working group — which included the Phoenix editor-in-chief — to refine its media policy. The updated guidelines allow faculty, staff and administrators to directly respond to media interview requests, and university marketing and communications staffers will help with finding experts, setting up interviews or answering questions whenever needed.
Henry Redman, former student editor-in-chief of the Loyola Phoenix, told ProPublica Illinois that student journalists at the weekly have no shortage of issues to pursue on and off campus, such as examinations of the campus safety department, sexual assault, street crime, dorm shortages and dining hall food quality.
“While it might not make administrators feel very good that their students are publishing all these things about them, they’re doing it because it’s important and they’re trying to make campus better for their readers,” said Redman, a 2019 journalism graduate from Cleveland.
Amelia Blakely, spring 2018 Daily Egyptian news editor, works through a story in the Daily Egyptian newsroom at Southern Illinois University Carbondale. (Brian Muñoz/The Daily Egyptian)
In June, student reporters at the University of Chicago’s The Chicago Maroon were subpoenaed as part of a lawsuit between the university and a donor foundation. The paper had obtained documents showing the foundation was concerned about the management of a $100 million donation to the school.
At Southern Illinois University in Carbondale, Brian Muñoz, The Daily Egyptian’s editor-in-chief during the 2018-19 school year, said the century-old student newspaper faced criticism after investigating the public university’s administration, including reporting about the former chancellor, a large number of interim positions and improper hires.
“We see ourselves as the watchdog,” said Muñoz, a recent graduate who is part of ProPublica’s Emerging Reporters Program. “I know we’ve gotten pushback from the administration and public that we have not given them a fair shake, and that’s not the case. If we didn’t love the university and care about it, we wouldn’t be here.”
So whatever roadblocks there are in the approval process, power through. It’s worth it.

The media needs to stop getting the Republican tax cuts wrong

Texto completo: With the 2020 election campaign heating up, the Republican tax cuts enacted in 2017 will be a major topic of debate. Most Republicans defend the tax cuts, while most Democrats want to repeal them. The two sides can debate the pros and cons of the tax cuts during the campaign, but before the debate goes any further, the media needs to stop mischaracterizing the tax cuts.
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was one of the most comprehensive tax overhauls ever enacted, a 185-page bill of individual, business, and international tax reforms. Yet as far as the media is concerned, the bill only slashed taxes for corporations and the wealthy.
For the past two years, the media has written story after story misrepresenting the tax cuts, repeatedly labeling them as "tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy."
This characterization of the bill is false and misleading, yet it is an assertion endlessly reported by reporters and pundits in the national media, as well as Democrats.
Before the bill was even passed, the New York Times reporter Alan Rappeport wrote in September 2017 that the Republican tax plan "would overwhelmingly benefit the wealthiest Americans and businesses." In November 2017, Washington Post columnist Catherine Rampbell called the bill "tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy," and in October 2018, she called it a "giveaway to corporations and the rich." Paul Waldman of the Washington Post parrots the same media view, writing in February 2019 that the "bulk of the benefits of the tax cuts went to the wealthy and corporations." Earlier this month, MSNBC's Joe Scarborough was even more specific, writing that the Trump tax cuts were for "multinational corporations and millionaire members inside his club."
All of these statements are incorrect, as a review of official government estimates clearly shows. The Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, which is staffed by professional economists, lawyers, and accountants, provides revenue estimates and analysis for every tax bill considered by Congress. The committee's report on the Republican tax cuts shows that the overwhelming bulk of tax cuts go to individuals, not corporations, and the bulk of these tax cuts go to millions of taxpayers earning far less than the wealthiest Americans.
The Joint Committee estimate of the budget effects of the tax cut over 10 years projects net individual tax cuts of $1,126.6 billion and net business tax cuts of $329.4 billion, for a total tax cut of $1,456.0 billion, rounded up in the media to a $1.5 trillion tax cut.
Simple math shows that 77.4% of the tax cuts goes to individuals, and only 22.6% goes to corporations.
The corporate rate reduction from 35 to 21% is estimated to reduce corporate taxes by $1.3 trillion. But the cost of this rate cut is offset by about $1 trillion in increased revenue from loophole closers, limits on deductions, and other corporate tax increases. This means that more than three-fourths of the corporate rate reduction is paid for by other corporate tax increases. That is hardly a giveaway.
The Joint Committee report on the bill also shows that most (86%) of the tax cut goes to taxpayers earning less than $1 million a year. More than half of the tax cuts goes to those with income between $30,000 and $200,000 a year. About 95% of individual taxpayers receive a tax cut, averaging an 8% cut. The largest percentage tax cuts (13.5%) go to those earning between $20,000 and $30,000. The smallest tax cuts (5.9%) go to those earning $1 million and more. This wealthiest group of taxpayers also has the largest percentage (13.8%) of taxpayers facing tax increases under the bill.
So, as these facts shows, it is simply not correct to claim that the tax cuts mainly benefit corporations and the wealthy. The overwhelming share of the tax cuts go to individuals, not corporations, and the overwhelming share of the tax cuts go to households far below the top of the income range. The media needs to get the facts straight and stop misrepresenting the Republican tax cuts.

Cal Thomas: N.Y. Times publisher is right (and wrong)

Texto completo: I never thought I would write this, but the publisher of The New York Times, A.G. Sulzberger, is right. Sulzberger wrote an op-ed for The Wall Street Journal in response to President Trump’s claim that his newspaper committed “treason” by publishing a story about U.S. efforts to compromise Russia’s power grid should Moscow again try to meddle in U.S. elections. The Times says it consulted National Security officials who raised no objections to its publication.
<img class="size-medium wp-image-2656862" src="https://i2.wp.com/multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/Cal-Thomas-Color.jpg?resize=300%2C190&ssl=1" alt="" width="300" height="190" data-recalc-dims="1" />
It is one thing for the president to criticize sloppy, inaccurate and biased reporting by the media, including The New York Times. It is quite another to use such an incendiary word as “treason,” whose definition does not fit what the president sees as a crime: “the offense of acting to overthrow one’s government or to harm or kill its sovereign; a violation of allegiance to one’s sovereign or to one’s state; the betrayal of a trust or confidence; breach of faith; treachery.”
Before becoming a columnist, I was a reporter for local TV stations and one network. In the early ’70s, during a pro-Vietnam War demonstration in Washington, I was called a communist by one of the demonstrators, simply because I had an NBC News logo on my microphone.
Hostility toward the press for failing to report, or ignoring, what many conservatives believe to be true (but isn’t always) has been around for some time. It has grown worse during the Trump administration.
It might help lower the temperature if what is collectively known as “the media” engaged in serious introspection. Why is public distrust of journalists so high?
Columbia Journalism Review reports on results of a new Knight Foundation and Gallup poll: “A majority of those who were surveyed said they had lost trust in the media in recent years, and more than 30 percent of those who identified themselves as being on the conservative end of the spectrum said they had not only lost faith in the media, but they ‘expect that change to be permanent.’ According to a separate Gallup poll from earlier this year that tracked trust in major institutions, newspapers and television news were among the lowest, exceeded only by Congress.”

This is dangerous, not only for journalism, which is seeing the decline of newspapers and an increase in staff layoffs, but also because a vibrant press is crucial to a strong nation, as the Founders believed.
The response to this and similar surveys over decades has been a collective shrug. There is no self-examination by the media and no change. Campaigns for “diversity” are about hiring more women and minorities, not ideological balance. Consumers of media — especially religious and conservative people — view the press as hostile to their core values.
Journalism is a business. Think of it this way. If you owned a gas station and were losing customers because gas prices were too high, the lighting was poor so that people felt unsafe at night and the restrooms were dirty, would you allow these conditions to persist? Would you even if a competitor opened a station across the street with lower prices, cleaner restrooms and better lighting? Not if you wanted to stay in business, you wouldn’t.
Too many in the media are like the guy who owns the substandard gas station, ignoring complaints about their performance. The predictable results are fewer readers of newspapers and lower ratings for television news programs.
What should frighten all of us in this latest survey is the number of people who say they expect their loss of faith in the media to be permanent.
Does any other business so disrespect its current customers and not try to win back the disaffected? While A.G. Sulzberger is right to criticize the president for his incendiary remark, he should also consider putting his own house in order, asking former readers what can be done to rebuild trust, not only for the good of the profession, but for the greater good of the country.

Texto completo: Infighting at the National Rifle Association exploded Wednesday, when the powerful association severed ties with its longtime public relations firm, suspended operations of its fiery online TV station and lost its top lobbyist.
The latest turmoil emerged just a year before the critical 2020 presidential elections when the NRA's ability to influence the outcome could decide the fate of gun rights.
Lobbyist Chris Cox, long viewed as the likely successor to longtime CEO Wayne LaPierre, was placed on administrative leave about a week ago by the NRA, which claimed he was part of a failed attempt to extort LaPierre and push him out.
It also came within hours of the association officially severing ties with Ackerman McQueen, the Oklahoma-based public relations firm that has shaped some of the NRA's most memorable messages in the past decades.
Cox had been the executive director of the NRA's lobbying arm, the Institute for Legislative Action, since 2002. He was credited with leading efforts to allow a decadelong ban on "assault weapons" to expire in 2004, an achievement that allowed the gun industry to resume selling what the industry calls "modern sporting rifles" and critics claim are used too often to exact mass carnage.
His resignation was confirmed by NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam. No other comment was immediately made about his departure.
Cox did not immediately return a message seeking comment. However, when he was suspended, Cox said in a statement obtained by The New York Times that allegations he had been part of a group seeking LaPierre's ouster were "offensive and patently false."
"For 24 years I have been a loyal and effective leader in this organization," he said.
Cox played his usual prominent role at the NRA's annual meeting in Indianapolis in April, and there was little public evidence that he and LaPierre or the NRA's board of directors were at odds. Infighting spilled out during what is normally a pep rally of sorts among gun-rights enthusiasts when Oliver North , then the NRA president, threatened to expose questionable personal and travel expenses unless LaPierre stepped down. Instead, LaPierre turned the tables on North and accused him of trying to extort him into submission.
Joel Friedman, a longtime NRA board member, told The Associated Press his first reaction when he heard that Cox was stepping down was surprise. He said he saw no indications during the annual meeting that Cox was in a dispute with LaPierre.
LaPierre announced Cox's resignation in an email sent Wednesday to staff and NRA board members that was obtained by the AP. The letter also said an investigation will continue into allegations that North sought to extort LaPierre and that the storied Marine veteran was aided by Cox, a claim first laid out in a lawsuit filed June 19.
In the past few months, the NRA has filed several lawsuits against Ackerman McQueen, accusing it of refusing to document its billings and of seeking to undermine the association. Ackerman McQueen has countersued, claiming the NRA is trying to renege on its financial obligations and smear the public relations firm.
Last year, NRA began asking all of its vendors for detailed documentation about its billings after New York authorities began threatening to investigate the NRA's nonprofit status. The NRA was founded shortly after the Civil War and is chartered in New York, giving that state broad authority to investigate its operations.
During its two decades by the NRA's side, Ackerman McQueen was responsible for crafting the association's aggressive messaging, including the now-famous "From my cold dead hands" line uttered by actor Charlton Heston in 2000 as he vowed to resist any effort to take away his guns. The line became a rallying cry for gun owners around the country.
Ackerman McQueen also created and operated NRATV. In a statement posted Wednesday on the NRA website, LaPierre said it would no longer be airing live programming and would be evaluating the station's future. It wasn't clear what would happen to its prominent hosts but there appeared to be no signs those on-air personalities, who are employees of Ackerman McQueen, would find spots at the NRA.
In a lawsuit, the NRA said some of its members had questioned NRATV's weighing in on "topics far afield of the Second Amendment."
In a statement Wednesday, Ackerman McQueen accused the NRA of trying to avoid its financial obligations by shuttering NRATV and implied its financial woes are partly the result of now paying for high-priced lawyers.
"When given the opportunity to do the right thing, the NRA once again has taken action that we believe is intended to harm our company even at the expense of the NRA itself," the company said.
"For Ackerman McQueen, it is time to move on to a new chapter without the chaos that has enveloped the NRA," the statement continued. "Ackerman McQueen will continue to fight against the NRA's repeated violations of its agreement with our company with every legal remedy available to us, but we will always be proud of the work that we completed during our 38-year relationship on behalf of the individual citizens that are the NRA."

GOP, Dems both treating Ohio like a 2020 battleground

Texto completo: Ohioans barely had time to can their yard signs for midterm candidates before political parties began descending on their neighborhoods in preparation for 2020.
Both parties are building up their staffs and ranks of volunteers in the Buckeye State, getting an early start on the presidential election as President Donald Trump prepares his reelection campaign and the increasingly crowded field of Democrats prepares for the first debates June 26 and 27.
Republicans are trying to solidify their position after Trump's 8-point victory in Ohio in 2016 and a near-sweep of statewide elected offices in 2018, while state Democrats are intent on flipping Ohio's 18 electoral votes for the candidate who emerges from the crowded presidential-nomination race.
Democrats have been left soul-searching over whether Ohio remains a swing state after Trump's gains in traditional Democratic strongholds such as the Mahoning Valley and a midterm election in which U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown was the party's only statewide victory in a partisan race.
The party's candidate for governor, Richard Cordray, fell flat despite collecting more than 2 million votes. His campaign manager told the New York Times shortly after the election that Democrats in 2020 should focus on states such as Arizona and Georgia instead of Ohio.
The national response has been mixed. This year, one liberal super-PAC left Ohio off its list of states where it planned to invest for 2020. But For Our Future included Ohio among a group of seven states where the liberal super-PAC plans to spend up to $90 million.
State party Chairman David Pepper called the notion that Ohio is no longer a swing state "a Republican talking point," pointing to a recent Morning Consult poll that concluded that more Ohioans disapproved of Trump than approved of his work.
Pepper said he was encouraged that Democrats narrowed their margins of defeat in statewide races for auditor, secretary of state and treasurer compared with 2010, two years before Ohio helped reelect President Barack Obama.
"Our goal as Democrats is to be the state that ends the Trump presidency," Pepper said. "Obviously if he doesn't win Ohio, it's over."
No Republican has won the White House without winning Ohio, which has been the nation's leading bellwether state since 1900.
The Ohio GOP isn't treating the race as if it's sewn up. The party already has added two communication staff members this year and promoted a political director. The Republican National Committee recently appointed a state director, and the Trump campaign tapped Clayton Henson, an Ohio native who worked on the 2016 campaign in the state, as its regional director.
"Ohio is always going to be in play, I think especially when you look at the Electoral College and the map," said Jane Timken, chair of the Ohio GOP.
In the coming months, the state GOP plans to add six regional directors and 15 field staff members. It will send them into neighborhoods around Ohio armed with voter data they can access through a mobile app, where they can enter more information that feeds back into the database.
"It's so critical to have that infrastructure. I'm a big believer in voter contacts. You have to know what the electorate is thinking," Timken said.
The Ohio Democratic Party has hired 10 organizers who have begun canvassing and attending events to enlist volunteers who the party hopes will help it flip Ohio blue in 2020.
The state party also is working to get voters registered or, if they have been stripped from the rolls, re-registered, focusing on urban areas where Democrats perform well and where, Pepper said, "voter purging" has hit hardest.
One of the biggest battlegrounds for the parties probably will be in suburbs, where both sides think they can sway 2020 voters by getting involved early and swinging local races in 2019. The Ohio GOP has targeted mayoral races in some suburbs, and the state Democrats have a "Main Street" initiative to help elect officeholders in suburbs and rural areas.
Democrats will need to focus on a message that resonates with both urban and rural voters in 2020, said Paul Beck, an emeritus professor of political science at Ohio State University. He cited a focus on how the opioid crisis continues to afflict Ohio, and targeting Republicans as the enemies of affordable health care.
Ohio is a "requirement" for Trump's path to reelection, but Democrats did little to break through in 2018, and Trump "does not seem to be taking the state for granted," said Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato's Crystal Ball, a political analysis and handicapping newsletter.

Texto completo: Two U.S. service members were killed in Afghanistan on Wednesday, the American-led NATO mission in Afghanistan said in a statement.
The identities of the soldiers were being withheld pending notification of next of kin. The statement did not offer any details surrounding the circumstances of their deaths.
A spokesman for the Taliban, Zabihullah Mujahid, said the two service members were killed in an ambush in eastern Wardak Province, The New York Times reported.
The deaths occurred one day after an unannounced visit to Kabul, the Afghan capital, by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
Meanwhile, the U.S. is holding direct talks with the Taliban in Doha, the Qatari capital. The seventh round of the talks are set to begin Saturday.
"We've made clear to the Taliban that we're prepared to remove our forces. I want to be clear, we've not yet agreed on a timeline to do so," Pompeo told reporters during an unannounced stop in Afghanistan on Tuesday. The presence of troops in Afghanistan is "conditions-based," he said.
The Taliban refuse to talk directly with the Afghan government, which it considers a puppet of the U.S.
More than 2,400 U.S. service personnel have died in Afghanistan since the U.S.-led coalition invaded the country after the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the U.S. The coalition sought to crush the Taliban and hunt down al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden.
The U.S. makes up the overwhelming majority of 14,000 coalition troops in Afghanistan. About 100,000 troops were stationed there at the height of the war.

Facing reality — and ourselves — in an image

Texto completo: Are they people or symbols? And if they're both — which they are ­— what do we owe to each?
You've seen the photograph by now, and if it doesn't break your heart you might want to ask yourself why. An overhead shot, taken from the top of a bank overlooking the Rio Grande, at two corpses face down in the water.
They are the bodies of Óscar Alberto Martínez Ramírez and his 23-month-old daughter, Valeria. They, along with Valeria's mother, Tania Vanessa Ávalos, were Salvadoran immigrants seeking asylum in the United States. Unable to cross the international bridge, they decided to test the waters separating Matamoros, Mexico, from Brownsville, Texas.
Reports of what happened have varied: According to The New York Times, Valeria was being ferried on her father's back when they were carried away by the waters near the US shore. Ávalos had swum back to shore and watched them drown. According to other media accounts, the father and daughter initially crossed safely, but when he returned to help Ávalos, the frightened girl jumped back into the water after him, and as he tried to rescue her, the two were swept away together.
The photograph was taken by Mexican photojournalist Julia Le Duc, and it instantly lodged in a terrible hall of fame, one that includes a naked Kim Phúc fleeing a napalm strike in Nick Ut's 1972 photo and Nilüfer Demir's shot of a drowned Syrian toddler, Alan Kurdi, on a Turkish beach in 2015. These are not “classic" images. They are evidence of desperation and inhumanity.
Such photographs generate instantcontroversy in the digital age, when all sides of an argument can be voiced with nuance or at top volume, and often both. The arguments can have to do with how sorry a viewer issupposed to feel for the victims; in this case, anti-immigrant partisans aresaying such people as Óscar Ramírez bring calamity upon themselves, while others point to the larger political and policy measures that back families like his into corners.
It's the children, the blameless innocents, that make these images inviolable and irresistible, that turns them into both semiotic weapons and clickbait. “This is the photo that encapsulates the cruelty of the Trump era," wrote Zack Beauchamp in Vox. It is the shorthand immediacy of an image like this that renders it a speechless op-ed column and causes it to be snapped up by news bureaus around the world. No editor in his or her right mind would pass up the chance to use this photo, one so obviously headed for the history books.
But maybe they should think a little harder about it.
In addition to the political storm over Le Duc's photograph, there's also a contentious cultural battle over who “owns" such images, how they're used in the public square, and whether that use honors or dishonors the lives and memory of the people in them.
Plenty of people, in America and around the world, on Facebook and on Twitter, shared the photo from the border, most saying some version of “this has to be seen" and “don't look away." Others quailed, describing the photo but not linking to it. Others made a case that such images trade ghoulishly on our fascination with death, that we're drawn to them because of the taboo they cross and not simply for the sufferings they capture.
And still others noted that many of the death images that transfix whole populations and become pivots of history tend to involve nonwhite victims — that Western news media outlets don't balk at showing us dead foreigners but shy from similar photographs of Americans. We know what the civilian victims of violence in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars look like. We don't want to see the US dead. They look too much like we're supposed to.
Le Duc's photograph occupies a gray area. It illustrates a sociopolitical tragedy — an avoidable one, one that has been caused — with a simplicity that breaks through the background chatter. The details both compel and obscure.Little Valeria's body is tucked inside her father's T-shirt, and her arm is wrapped protectively, beseechingly around his neck. They are face down in the water, a fused unity of failed yearning. We don't see their faces, as we don't see the full face of Alan Kurdi on that Mediterranean beach. If we did, it would be too unbearable, too confrontational. It would force us to contemplate our own complicity and inaction.
This is important. This is how people become signifiers for larger ideas and events.Kim Phúc is now 56 years old, lifelong friends with Nick Ut, her rescuer/memorializer, but she will always be that screaming, terrified child in our heads. The Ramírezes aren't as lucky. They're just icons now. It's how the dead get used.
How do you feel about that use? Is it fair to use the bodies of Óscar Ramírez and his 2-year-old daughter to make America and the world face up to the consequence of US border policy? To discomfit comfortable readers, prompt them finally to ask what they can do and then maybe even do it? Many would say yes. I would say yes. Is it fair to Ramírez's widow, Tania Ávalos? Even she might say yes, after she's done grieving in ways you and I may never have to contend with.
But just as important, I think, is to look them in the eye, not in death but as they were in life. There are photos going around the Internet of father, mother, and daughter alive and happy, disseminated by those who knew them and who want us to know, too — to know that they're not only symbols for the history books but individual human beings who had talents and quirks, who messed up in all the usual small ways and dreamed in all the big ones. That's how you rescue the memory of Óscar and Valeria Ramírez. That's how you make them more than today's media atrocity.
Only when you see them in their specificity do you realize they're just like you.

Texto completo: The spatial distribution of housing in Minneapolis and all of the Twin Cities metro area is a product of race and class. Yet curing this discrimination does not reside in the elimination of single family housing through changes in zoning or a comprehensive plan. Such an approach, call it neoliberal zoning, is destined to achieve the same results in land use that neoliberalism achieved economically over the last 40 years domestically and internationally.
Residential housing patterns are the product of discrimination. Private discriminatory preferences coupled with market decisions were enabled by racial covenants, government redlining, and zoning to produce the segregation patterns we see today. Countless books, such as Douglas Massey and Nancy Denton’s classic “American Apartheid,” tell this story well. Nearly 25 years ago at the University of Minnesota, I helped author a study pointing to the Twin Cities metro region being the third most segregated urban area in the nation. More recently, the U’s Institute on Metropolitan Opportunity located persistent segregation in the placement of low-income housing and education policy choices that concentrate low-income people of color in specific neighborhoods and schools.
Metrowide solution needed
Fixing this segregation demands a metrowide solution. Yet Minneapolis has acted on its own via its Minneapolis 2040 Comprehensive Plan to address this problem. Its solution mostly includes elimination of single-family zoning, believing that intensification of land use along with market incentives will encourage the building of more housing. Presumably this market-driven approach will mean more housing in more places, thereby fixing the economic and racial residential discrimination.
Both a New York Times article and current Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson have lauded this market-driven fix. Unfortunately, this approach will fail, exacerbating existing problems.
Again, the Minneapolis approach to liberating the market to address its housing woes is neoliberal zoning. Neoliberalism is the term used to describe a series of U.S. domestic and international economic policies that begin with Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher (in the UK) and continued through Bill Clinton and Tony Blair and into the present with Donald Trump. Neoliberals believe that a return to market fundamentalism – cutting government regulation and business taxes along with globalization in free trade – would rejuvenate domestic and world economies.
The reality, as many economists such as Thomas Piketty, Amartya Sen and Joseph Stiglitz have described and statistics show, is that neoliberalism has produced the greatest gaps between the rich and poor in the U.S. since before the Great Depression. The rich have truly gotten richer, with the middle and lower classes gaining little. Maybe we are overall richer as a nation as a result of neoliberalism, but the externalities of these policies have produced powerful economic inequities that overlap with race.
The elimination of single-family zoning to encourage intensified land use across the city rests on a similar logic that will yield parallel results. In theory the breaking up of large single-family houses in south Minneapolis will produce more housing, but it is doubtful it will be low-income or affordable. Conversely, permitting the breakup of existing homes in north Minneapolis into multifamily units or their demolishing and replacement with multiple units also will not guarantee affordable housing in integrated neighborhoods. This is a recipe for gentrification as developers will enter areas, buy homes, and dislocate current residents by building more high-end units.
Ignores the way housing markets work
The Minneapolis comp-plan fix ignores the realities of the way housing markets work. While there may be a local demand for affordable housing, housing is also a national market sensitive to price, profit, and cost issues that often are not local. Developers have few incentives to provide affordable housing.
Beyond the fact the neoliberal zoning will not fix the segregation problems, elimination of single-family zoning will produce additional problems. One, there is an inherent value in preserving a mixture of uses — from a historic preservation perspective but also in terms of how a multiplicity of uses, ages, and styles of buildings and residential options appeals to the widest variety of individuals. As Jane Jacobs, perhaps the greatest 20th-century scholar on cities, wrote in her “Death and Life of Great American Cities,” cities are generators of diversity; it is that which makes them interesting and centers of commerce. Two, phasing out single-family zoning does not eliminate a demand for these types of units and people seeking them, often middle class and those starting families, will flee to the suburbs. Three, for many, single-family homes represent a sense of community, connectedness, and stability that are worth preserving. Finally, given how interconnected residential and education discrimination are, tackling one without addressing the other dooms solving both problems.
Minneapolis’ population is exploding, and more housing is needed to address that demand. This housing needs to address all income levels and needs, and be spatially distributed in a way that is economically and racially fair. Unfortunately, Minneapolis’s neoliberal zoning policies will do little to address these issues.

Texto completo: Tulsi Gabbard's sister groused that Elizabeth Warren was being given outsize time to speak during the first Democratic presidential debate Wednesday evening.
The Hawaii congresswoman's younger sister, Vrindavan, a U.S. marshal, used the congresswoman's Twitter account near the one-hour mark of the two-hour debate. The sisters live together in a house close to Capitol Hill.
"It's clear who MSNBC wants to be president: Elizabeth Warren. They're giving her more time than all the other candidates combined. They aren't giving any time to Tulsi at all," Vrindavan said on her sister's Twitter account in a tweet that bore her signature.
Tweet
The debate was being hosted by MSNBC, as well as NBC and Telemundo.
Despite Vrindavan's complaint about Warren, the New York Times tracker determined Sen. Cory Booker was given the most amount of time to speak during the first hour of the debate in Miami.
Gabbard has 0.8% in the latest RealClearPolitics average of polls while Warren, a senator from Massachusetts, has 12.8%.

Waubonsee marks another year of contributing to community

Texto completo: In a recent opinion column in The New York Times, David Brooks makes the case that there should be more rituals in life and in society.
"Rituals often mark doorway moments, when we pass from one stage of life to another. They acknowledge that these passages are not just external changes but involve internal transformation," Brooks writes.
Brooks also writes about the value of "collective rituals" for communities; occasions that, among other things, would be for "people to make promises toward one another — specific ways they are going to use their gifts to solve the common challenge. Towns are built when people make promises to one another, hold people accountable and sacrifice together through repeated interaction toward a common end."
That really is the essence of a college education. Colleges provide those doorway moments for people. In fact, our vision statement at Waubonsee begins with, "Waubonsee Community College opens the door of knowledge."
The people who pass through the door of knowledge are then prepared to use their knowledge and skills to solve common problems and work toward that common end.
In the 2018-2019 academic year, we recognized and celebrated the accomplishments and contributions of many people at Waubonsee. People like Chad Lockman, Cassie Day and Heather Binder, who all graduated from Waubonsee and now help their communities through assisting military veterans, teaching, and improving living conditions, respectively.
We highlighted the student success coaches who help people achieve their dreams of a college education, and we featured the college’s Fire Science Technology Program, which trains future community first responders and leaders.
We also joined with our community by providing the new Aurora Strong Scholarship as a recognition of the community support and strength demonstrated after the tragic shooting of Feb. 15 in Aurora.
James Fallows, a longtime correspondent for The Atlantic, wrote a book with his wife Deborah in 2018 about the travels to cities and towns across America. He wrote in "Our Towns: A 100,000-Mile Journey Into the Heart of America," "Not every city can have a research university. Any ambitious one can have a community college. And while research universities are the most important parts of the U.S. educational system from a global perspective, I’ve come to think that community colleges matter most domestically right now."
At last month’s commencement we celebrated our 51st graduating class, a collective ritual marking both the external changes and internal transformation of people as they prepare to enrich their lives, their families and their communities.
We are grateful to play a part in the contributions that Waubonsee alumni make within our community every day.

Huskies in Big East: How this affects XU

Texto completo: With reports surfacing the Big East Conference has approved the addition of UConn as its 11th member school beginning in 2020, it's worth a look at what that will mean for Xavier's men's basketball program and the conference's other nine schools.
UConn's Board of Trustees is reportedly expected to accept the Big East's invitation at a meeting Wednesday morning, and the conference is expected to announce the news in a press conference Thursday afternoon at Madison Square Garden. UConn was one of the seven schools that founded the Big East in 1979 and the Huskies remained in the conference until it broke up in 2013, at which time UConn became part of the American Athletic Conference, while Villanova, Georgetown, St. John's, Providence, Marquette, Seton Hall and DePaul welcomed Xavier, Butler and Creighton into the new Big East.
The fact that UConn has such a rich tradition with four national championships (1999, 2004, 2011 and 2014) only helps bolster the Big East brand. The Huskies are currently searching to return to that championship form having missed the NCAA Tournament in three straight seasons with new head coach Dan Hurley ready to start his second season. The most obvious result of this move is the Big East basketball calendar will move to 20 regular-season games in the traditional round-robin format.
The new conference schedule means Xavier will lose a little of its non-conference scheduling flexibility and control, especially considering the Musketeers have four long-term deals with Cincinnati, Wake Forest, the Big 12 and the Big Ten.
But it's a big win for the Big East Tournament, under contract through 2028 with Madison Square Garden. To add another northeastern program, one that was already a main draw in the old Big East, to a tournament that routinely fills the Garden to capacity means the tournament should continue to thrive.
This will also impact TV. In 2013, the Big East and Fox Sports signed a reported 12-year, $500 million deal and, according to The New York Times, that "contract could spike to $600 million if the conference grows to a dozen teams."

Texto completo: HAZEBROUCK, France -- There is no plaque at the tiny stadium here. Nothing to commemorate the long-ago match. Some players say they had no idea of its immediate significance until the final whistle. One of the best players was absent, unable to get the day off from work.
And only decades later did the soccer officials who long ignored the women's game, and allowed it to be banned in England, France and Germany, append a larger, contrived meaning to the game. As if history could be attached like an artificial hip.
On April 17, 1971, a chilly Saturday night, France defeated the Netherlands, 4-0, at Stade Auguste Damette. About 1,000 spectators showed up to watch the French midfielder Jocelyne Ratignier dazzle with a hat trick. Afterward, some French players say, they were informed that it had been a qualifying match for an unofficial Women's World Cup to be played in August of that year in Mexico. Some remember a toast of Champagne.
At the turn of the 21st century, FIFA, soccer's world governing body, decided to recognize that France-Netherlands game as the first official women's international match. It was no such thing. England and Scotland had played in the late 1800s. In 1920, a French team played a team from England, before which the captains kissed each other on the cheek for good luck and sportsmanship -- eliciting perhaps the first international media moment for women's soccer.
A photograph of the kiss appeared in newspapers from Australia to South America to Asia, according to Jean Williams, a sports historian from Britain.
"I call it the kiss that went around the world," Williams said.
Still, the 1971 match serves as a revealing origin story for the current Women's World Cup, and a helpful illustration of how the sport has evolved in France and elsewhere. The players from that France team are being honored with appearances at French matches this month. It was a team that was strictly amateur. Many players were students; some were still in high school. They often faced a dismissiveness, told to go home and cook and darn socks. Today, the French national team consists of professionals honing their skills in a thriving domestic league.
The 1971 match also serves as a tacit admission by FIFA that it had failed women's soccer for decades. Not until 1991 was there an official Women's World Cup. And even then, the designation was added only in retrospect, so wary was FIFA of sharing its most valuable brand with a women's event featuring 12 teams playing 80-minute games.
"It's amazing how there has been a change of mentality," Colette Guyard, 67, a midfielder on France's 1971 team, said through an interpreter. "Women are no longer washing socks."
Organized matches between women's teams in France actually began in Paris in 1917, and a French women's league was formed in 1919, according to the historian Lindsay Sarah Krasnoff, author of a history of French sport called "The Making of Les Bleus." But in 1941, a year after France was overtaken by the Nazis, the collaborationist Vichy government banned women's soccer under the pretext that "there was too great a risk" that the sport would make women "more masculine," according to a study by a French research organization called Iris.
That stereotype persisted in France as late as 1965, according to an article on FIFA's website in 2011, which pointed to an article in France Football magazine that declared, "in our opinion, football is only for men."
But attitudes about women and sports began to shift in the late 1960s, a period of social upheaval and second-wave feminism. In 1970, the French soccer federation officially recognized the women's game. That same year, said Ghislaine Royer-Souef, a goalkeeper and central defender, her French club team from Reims toured several American cities, playing matches against an Italian team.
"We were told we were the ones bringing women's football to the U.S.," Royer-Souef, 66, said through an interpreter. "I'm very proud of it."
The coach of that Reims club, Pierre Geoffroy, also coached France's national team. For the 1971 match against the Netherlands, players remembered training on sandy hills and taking long hikes through a forest.
A surviving poster from the match, now part of a touring World Cup exhibition, mentions that it was preparation for the "world championship." Royer-Souef remembered Geoffroy telling the team "to play well because with a victory we would be able to go to Mexico." France scored early, she said, and the team was able to relax.
Other players remember Geoffroy withholding news about the unofficial World Cup, perhaps trying not to make the team overly nervous.
"We only knew after the match," Guyard said.
One of the team's best players, a wing named Michele Wolf, missed the game, teammates said, to work her shift at a grocery store.
"We were amateurs, not professionals," Royer-Souef said. "She had to work to be able to eat. She was not going to lose her job for a football match."
Wolf also missed the unofficial World Cup that August in Mexico, teammates said. That tournament featured six teams: four from Europe and two from Latin America. The teams' travel expenses were paid by Martini & Rossi, the Italian beverage company that organized the tournament, and brazen chauvinism prevailed in the pretournament buildup.
A United Press International dispatch appeared in The New York Times on June 27, 1971, under the headline: "Soccer Goes Sexy South of Border." The goal posts would be painted pink and the players would wear shorts "as close as possible to hot pants," the article noted, adding that there would be "beauty salons" in the dressing rooms "so the girls can present themselves for interviews and public ceremonies complete with false eyelashes, lipstick and an attractive hairdo."
A photograph from the tournament appeared to show that the goal posts indeed were painted pink and white. But other photographs indicate that organizers might have showed some restraint when it came to uniforms and beauty salons in the dressing rooms, according to Williams, the historian.
Ratignier, the former French midfielder and a recently retired professor of physical education, said she had no recollection of organizers trying to make the players appear more sexy.
Denmark won the 1971 world championship, defeating Mexico, 3-0, in the final before an estimated crowd of 110,000 at Estadio Azteca in Mexico City. France finished fifth, defeating England, 3-2, in a consolation match. Royer-Souef scored the deciding goal.
The French players sang La Marseillaise, their national anthem, and Royer-Souef said she felt proud to represent a renewal of women's soccer. But, Guyard said, in some ways it did not feel as if she and her teammates were representing their country the way the current players are.
Unlike nowadays, there was little news coverage in France of the 1971 tournament. "No one knew women were playing in Mexico," Guyard said. "How does that make you feel?"
Ratignier, 65, said that she retained complicated feelings about the arc of women's soccer, in France and elsewhere. Speaking through an interpreter, she explained that she felt "very lucky" to have played in a World Cup, even an unofficial one, at age 17. And she applauded the recent advances in women's soccer, while noting that they had come slowly and were "still not enough."
"We played in 1971, and it took another 20 years for the first official Women's World Cup," Ratignier said. "I feel happy about the evolution. I just don't know how to feel about it when it takes so long."

Texto completo: For a Race This Big, We Had to Think Big
A NOTE FROM PATRICK HEALY, THE POLITICS EDITOR: After years of reporting on presidential campaigns, I thought I was prepared for unpredictability: John Kerry routing Howard Dean in 2004, the battle for the ages between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama in 2008, the rise of Donald J. Trump in 2016. Then came last winter. There was Elizabeth Warren outside her house on New Year's Eve talking to reporters about why she was running for president. Days later it was Tulsi Gabbard and Julián Castro declaring their candidacies. Kirsten Gillibrand entered the race on Stephen Colbert's show, and Kamala Harris at Howard Uni - versity, her alma mater. Before January was out, Pete Buttigieg and Marianne Williamson were in, too. The country has never had so many candidates for president, including a record-shattering six women running. As the politics editor of The New York Times for the 2020 campaign, I started telling myself, "You've got to get a lot more creative covering this race." We needed to help our readers get a handle on all the Democrats, their public positions and their personal stories. Otherwise the campaign risked turning into a blur of policy rollouts, Iowa trips, Twitter threads and televised town halls featuring ever-changing topics. Reporters and editors started kicking around ideas, and an ambitious one quick - ly emerged: inviting candidates to sit for vid - eo interviews where we'd ask the same questions to each of them. A primary aim was to help introduce the Democrats to voters, and offer some basis for comparison -- the answers to one set of questions. We began brainstorming about the most illuminating things to ask, a mix of policy and personal matters. We tried to reflect debates within the Democratic Party, as well as identify distinct angles on issues that would yield specific, compelling answers. The project also excited us because we didn't know if we could pull it off. We'd need a lot of candidates to participate for the videos to have payoff for readers, and there was no guarantee that the Democrats would say yes to a visit to The Times. We'd written tough stories on many of them, including busy candidates with packed schedules like Ms. Warren, Ms. Harris, Mr. Buttigieg, Bernie Sanders, Beto O'Rourke and Amy Klobuchar. We made the pitch that the project was meant to inform the electorate and help people get their arms around a crowded, complicated campaign. After three months of phone calls and emails, and a few long flights to interview some of the Demo - crats on the campaign trail, we had 21 candidates answer the same 18 questions. Only Joe Biden declined, after weeks of requests, citing a lack of time in his schedule. We rolled out the videos of the candidates last week. With this special section of The Times, we wanted to bring their voices and views to you in print, too. The quotes in these pages are selections from the videos, which you can watch in full at nytimes.com. Thank you for reading.

The Most Crowded Field in Modern History
The number of Democrats running for president -- 24 -- is the largest for one party in modern political history. The previous record was held by the Republicans in 2016, when Donald J. Trump came out ahead of 16 other candidates.

Texto completo: Los Angeles billionaire Eli Broad has joined the call for higher taxes on the wealthy, saying progressive social policies are not enough to alleviate the growing prosperity gap between the rich and everyone else.
In an opinion piece published Tuesday in the New York Times, Broad, 86, a lifelong Democrat who has donated heavily to the charter school movement, said that he has "come to realize that no amount of philanthropic commitment will compensate for the deep inequities preventing most Americans -- the factory workers and farmers, entrepreneurs and electricians, teachers, nurses and small-business owners -- from the basic prosperity we call the American dream."
"Let's admit out loud what we all know to be true: A wealth tax can start to address the economic inequality eroding the soul of our country's strength. I can afford to pay more, and I know others can too," he wrote in the article headlined "I'm in the 1 Percent. Please, Raise My Taxes."

The article comes just one day after fellow billionaire George Soros and 17 other ultra-high-net-worth individuals published an open letter to the 2020 presidential candidates to support a "moderate" wealth tax on the "fortunes of the richest 1/10 of the richest 1% of Americans -- on us."
It also follows similar calls by billionaires, including Warren Buffett, for higher taxes on the wealthy. Such calls have arisen as the income gap has grown between the rich and others since the recession -- and studies have shown the wealthy have disproportionately benefited from the 2017 Republican tax cuts.
The open letter to the presidential candidates was posted days before the first debate among the Democratic hopefuls, scheduled to take place Wednesday in Miami. It highlighted the proposal by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) for a tax targeting the 75,000 wealthiest families in the country, those with assets worth more than $50 million.
Broad also noted Warren's plan and described Sen. Bernie Sanders' (I-Vt.) call for an increase on estate and inheritance taxes as "overdue."
He also appeared to throw his support behind a proposal to tax capital gains as income rather than at the current lower rate.
"I'm not an economist, but I have watched my wealth grow exponentially thanks to federal policies that have cut my tax rates while wages for regular people have stagnated and poverty rates have increased," Broad wrote.
Veteran Democratic political strategist Mark Mellman said Monday that he expected more of the progressive wealthy would join the call for higher taxes on themselves, providing Democrats a talking point in their push to change the tax code.
"The ultra-wealthy know they are not paying their fair share. It should be difficult for Republicans or anyone else to say they are paying their fair share," he said.
Broad founded and ran home builder KB Home and retirement services company SunAmerica before devoting himself full time to civic work and philanthropy. He has an estimated net worth of $6.7 billion, according to Forbes.

At the border, media is kept in the dark on migrant conditions

Texto completo: Overcrowded facilities. Sick, filthy and hungry children sleeping on concrete floors. Young children taking care of infants and toddlers in the enforced absence of their parents.
News stories emerged last week about squalid conditions at a Border Patrol detention facility housing about 300 migrant children on the U.S.-Mexico border. The media accounts described the facility in Clint, Tex., near El Paso, that houses children separated from their parents by order of the Trump administration.
Apart from their appalling specifics, the stories were notable for one element: They were all based on secondhand accounts. Reporters were unable to see the facilities themselves or speak to any of the children. Instead, they relied on descriptions provided by lawyers and advocates who were granted access under a legal settlement with the Border Patrol.
The blackout on press access has left Americans largely in the dark about conditions in government facilities designed to handle migrants who have crossed the border. Photographs and TV images are rare and often dated. Rarer still are interviews with federal agency managers and employees or with the children themselves.
Journalists, government officials and migrant advocates agree that permitting reporters to see the facilities firsthand would change public perceptions about the treatment of migrants. There's disagreement, however, about how it would change.
"If journalists had access to the detention centers at the border where children are being held in filthy conditions, those centers would not exist," said Elora Mukherjee, an attorney who interviewed children at the Texas facility and described them to reporters last week. "If videos were released there would be massive changes" because the public outcry would be enormous.
Mukherjee, who directs the Immigrants' Rights Clinic at Columbia Law School, said the conditions she witnessed at the federally run facility in Clint were the "worst ever" in the dozen years she has been representing and interviewing migrant children in federal custody.
Government officials say legal issues, especially privacy concerns, make unfettered media access to border facilities a non-starter. According to one official, the general counsel's office of the Department of Homeland Security, which supervises border law enforcement agencies, has advised the agency that it is unlawful for third parties to take photographs or videos of "pretrial detainees," especially of children, who cannot legally consent to such media portrayals.
Officials at the Department of Health and Human Services, which supervises many of the detention facilities, have periodically given tours of the facilities to journalists on the condition that no images or recordings are made.
The restrictive media policy, however, is under debate within the two agencies. Some officials argue that more transparency would be beneficial because it would allow the public to see the extensive efforts made by government employees and contractors dealing with a spike in the number of migrants. Even images that document inadequacies at the facilities might be beneficial because they could help build popular support for more resettlement funding from Congress.
A DHS spokesman declined to comment. Customs and Border Protection officials did not reply to a request for comment.
Caitlin Dickerson, who covers immigration for the New York Times, said gaining access to the detention facilities - never easy under any circumstances - has gotten harder since December, when two children died in federal custody. (Since then, at least five more have died.) Dickerson isn't sure whether officials are intentionally barring reporters or they're simply unable to deal with an upsurge in the news media's requests for entry.
In any case, she said, the press tours that officials have permitted are typically short and highly structured, with no interviews or follow-up allowed. Access is usually restricted to only part of a facility.
Reporters on the beat say they often have to use indirect and secondary means to get information, including talking to contractors, adult relatives of the children and lawyers advocating for the children. An infamous audio recording of children wailing while held at one facility last year was obtained by a civil rights attorney and published by ProPublica.
"We're doing our best as journalists with the information that's available to us," said Martha Mendoza, an Associated Press investigative reporter who broke last week's story about the Clint facility with colleagues Cedar Attanasio and Garance Burke. "We're using all the tools we can find to hold everyone accountable, which is what our role is."
Burke said conditions for children in Customs and Border Protection custody have never been good, and concerns about their treatment there predate the Trump administration. The difference this time, she said, is there are more children than ever living in unhealthful conditions.
Burke and Mendoza last year obtained confidential government documents that showed the full extent of the child-migrant crisis. The two reporters were part of a team of AP journalists whose coverage became a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize this year in national reporting.
Their work suggests sunlight can have positive effects.
On Monday, four days after the AP reported on conditions at the Texas center, Border Patrol officials removed most of the children from it. Just 30 children remained at the facility, down from some 300 before the news stories emerged. Rep. Veronica Escobar (D-Tex.), whose district covers El Paso, complained to Customs and Border Protection (CBP) leadership following the news reports. She said most of the children had been moved to a temporary site nearby with rollout mattresses, showers, medical facilities and air conditioning.
However, the agency returned 100 children to the station on Tuesday, citing lack of bed space in U.S. shelters and insufficient funding to expand facilities for children.
Also on Tuesday, CBP's acting commissioner, John Sanders, resigned, continuing the instability in the leadership of agencies overseeing border operations amid a surge in the migrant population. Sanders had been in the job for less than two months.
In a statement emailed to the AP on Monday, the Border Patrol offered no apologies for conditions at its Clint facility. "Our short-term holding facilities were not designed to hold vulnerable populations," it said, "and we urgently need additional humanitarian funding to manage this crisis."

Texto completo: The world of recorded music was shaken to its core June 11, when The New York Times Magazine published “The Day The Music Burned,” a story about a devastating fire in the Universal Music Group vaults in 2008.
As journalist Jody Rosen writes, the fire (which had been … let’s call it “downplayed” by Universal) consumed thousands upon thousands of original master recordings by artists such as John Coltrane, Patsy Cline, Tupac Shakur, Beck and Sheryl Crow — a very small sample of big names, in addition to dozens, perhaps hundreds more that remain obscure.
Does this mean the best-known recordings will suddenly vanish from the Earth?
Of course not. Master tapes are the original-source documents of these recordings and often contain unreleased outtakes or studio conversations, but the albums and songs everyone has heard for decades remain documented in other formats.
Does it mean that we might never completely know what music our culture lost, given the amount of unreleased material from various sessions that was on those tapes, or that the fidelity of the recordings we have will not likely improve in the future now that those first-generation tapes are gone?
Absolutely.
The article has sparked a conversation among musicians and fans about the preservation obligations of record companies both large and small. To put it bluntly: Do you, musicians of the world, know where your masters are? We asked a few Austin artists at various stages of their careers if they knew the answer.
Kelly Willis has been making music since she was a teenager and releasing records since 1990 for labels such as MCA and Rykodisc. She and husband Bruce Robison have released albums on their own Premium Records label since 2007.
Willis said she has masters only for the music she and Robison released themselves: “I don’t know who has my others or where they are.”
Monte Warden, whose band the Wagoneers rose to prominence with Willis in the late 1980s when both singers were still in their teens, says that “every one of my A&M masters” was lost in the Universal fire. The Wagoneers made two albums for A&M Records, which later was folded into UMG.
Warden says the band also did a gospel session for A&M that was never released and didn’t get to the final mixing stage. Without the masters, remixing is now impossible. “Rough analog mixes is all we have,” he said.
The news is better for his new recordings, such as an as yet unreleased album he recently completed with his pop-jazz combo, the Dangerous Few. “There are three hard copies of the original masters just here in Austin,” Warden said.
Austin rock outfit White Denim declined to answer the question through its publicist, who did note that the band — which recently formed its own label called Radio Milk Recording Company — is reissuing a vinyl version of its 2010 self-released album, “Last Day of Summer.” It will be remastered from the original recordings, which White Denim always owned. The band plays an album release show Aug. 24 at its own Radio Milk performance space.
Singer Eric Burton and guitarist/producer Adrian Quesada make up Austin soul act Black Pumas. Their self-titled debut is out now on ATO Records, and the masters for it remain in Quesada’s hands.
“We own our masters and I am in control of the physical possession of them, because it was all recorded and mixed at my studio,” Quesada said. “Nowadays, being that everything is stored digitally (in addition to physical master tapes), I feel like it’s a lot easier to keep track of your masters. Even though I record onto analog tape, I do not store analog masters, though I probably should.”
Oddly enough, one of the most chaotic Austin acts has all its masters. King Coffey, drummer for the longtime Austin act Butthole Surfers, which has been recording and touring on and off since 1981, said the band is in possession of all its masters.
“I believe we have everything,” Coffey said. “We have a storage unit that contains a bunch of crap from the 1980s, including several shelves of tapes, including the multi-tracks (the tapes on which the music was actually recorded).
“For almost everything, we have backup copies, so if we sent a master tape to a label for production, we almost always made a safety dupe for ourselves. If that unit burns down, we’re pretty screwed.”
Coffey’s active band, USA/Mexico, recorded entirely on digital. “We have those files, but they can degrade,” Coffey said. “We should be making backups.”
Perhaps in keeping with the Surfers’ overall oddness, the tapes even survived the years the band had no permanent home.
“For the few years we lived on the road, we were carrying a couple of boxes of tapes in the van,” Coffey said. “It’s amazing they survived until we could put them in a safe place.” He credits Surfers guitarist (and longtime producer for other bands) Paul Leary for such care.
“Paul is the man,” Coffey said. “He is an engineer at heart and took all this very seriously.”
Not surprisingly, news came last week of artists taking legal action against Universal in a joint lawsuit that included Soundgarden, Tom Petty’s ex-wife Jane Benyo and native Texan singer-songwriter Steve Earle.
That didn’t surprise Warden. “I’m sure there’s going to be some litigation,” he said before the suit had been filed. “But who cares? That’s just for some payout. This stuff is irreplaceable.”
For her part, Willis refuses to dwell on the past.
“I try not to think too much about it all because it’s a bummer,” Willis said. “Why be sad? You have to live in the moment.”

Texto completo: TOMS RIVER – Ocean County will join hundreds of cities, towns and county governments across the United States in a federal lawsuit against some of the biggest pharmaceutical companies in the world over America's epidemic of opioid abuse.
Without comment on Wednesday evening, the Board of Freeholders approved a resolution authorizing that a complaint be filed on its behalf in the National Prescription Opiate Litigation multidistrict litigation, MDL 2804. The vote was 4-to-0.
The lawsuit alleges that the manufacturers of prescription opioids grossly misrepresented the risks of long-term use for patients with chronic pain, and that distributors failed to properly monitor suspicious orders of those prescription drugs — all of which contributed to the current crisis.
In 2017, Toms River, Brick and Berkeley moved forward with similar litigation — although it was not immediately clear whether those municipalities were part of the same lawsuit.
Earlier this year, The New York Times reported that "the litigation has ballooned to 1,548 federal court cases, brought on behalf of cities and counties, 77 tribes, hospitals, union benefit funds, infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome and others — in total, millions of people. With a potential payday amounting to tens of billions of dollars, it has become one of the most complicated and gargantuan legal battles in American history."
After the meeting, Freeholder Director Virginia E. Haines explained that the litigation would not cost county taxpayers a dollar — the law firm representing the county would take about 20 percent of whatever fraction Ocean County was entitled to from whatever judgment or settlement may be reached in the case.
In the event of such a judgment or settlement, Haines said she would advocate that Ocean County use its share of the money to fund long-term drug rehabilitation care in the county for residents who cannot afford the cost and whose health insurance does not cover long-term treatment.
"I feel like we need to put a lot more money into rehab facilities," Haines said. "Right now, it's 14 days unless you have insurance. But you really need nine months to a year to really get full treatment — that's what I feel is important."
ABC News reported Friday that the number of public entities which joined the lawsuit had reached about 1,800 last week — they included Bergen County, New York's Albany County, as well as Baton Rouge, Louisiana and major cities such as Atlanta and Phoenix.
"The federal bundle of cases accuses opioid manufacturers, like Purdue Pharma and Johnson & Johnson, of aggressively marketing the drugs while misleading doctors and the public about how addictive they are," ABC News reported on its website. "They also accuse distributors, like McKesson, of moving huge quantities of the painkillers without alerting authorities, and accuse pharmacies like CVS Health and Walgreens of selling large amounts of the pills to patients."
The network reported that a potential settlement in the case could reach about $100 billion in total.
Ocean County has consistently been one of the counties in New Jersey hardest hit by the scourge of opioid addiction and overdose deaths.
In 2016, Ocean County had the second-highest total and rate of overdose deaths of any county in the state. Only Essex County, the most populous in the state, had more deaths and only Atlantic County had a higher rate of fatal overdoses per capita.
In Ocean County, between 2013 and 2016, 576 people died of suspected overdoses, according to state records.

Texto completo: What's on TV
TIANANMEN: THE PEOPLE VERSUS THE PARTY (2019) 9 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). Earlier this month thousands of Hong Kong residents began marching against a bill that would allow extraditions to the mainland. The timing of the demonstrations makes them ever more potent: This month marks the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre, when Chinese troops unleashed their firepower on a throng of protesters in Beijing who were calling for democracy in the Communist country. This new documentary revisits the seven weeks that led up to the killings and maps out how a peaceful, student-led movement ended in unthinkable carnage. The director Ian MacMillan weaves archival footage with testimony from protesters, witnesses and Communist Party insiders who watched the tragedy unfold.
What's Streaming
MIKE EPPS: ONLY ONE MIKE (2019) Stream on Netflix. Throughout his 20 years in entertainment, Mike Epps ("Next Friday," "How High") has usually appeared on the sidelines playing goofy secondary characters. But when it comes to comedy, he steals the show. In this new special, the actor and comic performs in front of a packed house in Washington, delivering salacious one-liners (some more juvenile than others) and ruminating on relationships and family. One moment he's flashing a toothy smile and explaining how old age can slow down a man's sex drive. The next he's recalling how his daughter's boyfriend won him over (it involved some potent weed).
MY BEAUTIFUL LAUNDRETTE (1986) Stream on the Criterion Channel; rent on Amazon, iTunes or Vudu. This beloved dramedy, directed by Stephen Frears, tackles homophobia, racism and sociopolitical inequality with one too many subplots. But the thread that holds it together is the impenetrable romance between Omar (Gordon Warnecke), a young Pakistani man in South London, and Johnny (Daniel Day-Lewis), a childhood friend who grew up to be a street punk. After his uncle asks him to take over a rundown laundromat, Omar crosses paths with Johnny and enlists his help. The two transform the dirty establishment into a glamorous one, rekindle their spark and get caught up in a drug deal along the way. Writing in The New York Times, Vincent Canby called the movie a "rude, wise, vivid social comedy." He added: "'My Beautiful Laundrette' has the broad scope and the easy pace that one associates with our best theatrical films."
DAMNED Stream on Britbox. Before Himesh Patel landed the lead role in the upcoming Beatles movie "Yesterday" (opening Friday), he co-starred in this British workplace sitcom about social workers who focus on children services. The show deftly balances its weighty subject material -- some cases involve student-teacher relationships, missing teenagers and prostitution -- with a hilarious portrayal of humdrum work life akin to that of "The Office." "Damned" only ran on Channel 4 for two seasons, but critics gave it a thumbs up: The Telegraph called it "unforgiving, warm and extremely funny."

Texto completo: In 2009, President Donald Trump signed an open letter to President Obama asking for action on climate change. Published in The New York Times shortly before the Copenhagen climate conference, it stated: “We support your effort to ensure meaningful and effective measures to control climate change, an immediate challenge facing the USA and the world. Please allow us, the USA, to serve in modeling the change necessary to protect humanity and our planet.” Since becoming president he hasn’t followed through on his earlier convictions, but rather in the opposite direction.
Sen. Mitt Romney had a similar about-face. He went from accepting climate science and promoting strategies to deal with it as a governor to state as the presidential candidate, “My view is that we don’t know what’s causing climate change on this planet,” and his proposed energy policies aligned with that outlook.
What causes this 180? Is it that they become privy to science that turns them to skepticism, which they are forbidden to share with us all? Or is it that entrenched big money interests have too much influence in our government and want to ensure the continuation of the status quo at the expense of the future?

Texto completo: It's time for a new legislative majority
Like most New Hampshire residents, I want my representatives in Concord to exercise common sense in voting on public issues. It would also be nice if they checked with the folks back home for our opinion before making significant changes in our state government.
I was unhappy to learn that the Democratic majority of state representatives, in a party-line vote, approved $400 million in higher state taxes. Mind you, they started with a healthy rainy day fund, and state tax revenues are already higher than expected, thanks to wise fiscal and tax policies enacted by the governor and previous state legislative majority. So why did they need to vote for all these higher taxes?
Democrats didn't need to do this. All that was needed was a little Granite State family common sense, like you don't spend more money than you have. The governor gets it; what's wrong with the state representative majority?
It may be fun for them to spend other people's money, but the added tax burdens they voted for will fall on the backs of ordinary folks in New Hampshire, and I, for one, do not appreciate the extra taxes. Thanks to low taxes, our state economy has been growing the fastest of any state in New England. Hiking state taxes isn't going to help this growth continue.
If this is the way our state representative majority thinks that public business should get done in Concord, then it seems to me that we may need to elect a new legislative majority next year.

Net metering bill veto was the right decision
With his veto of the net metering bill (House Bill 365), Gov. Chris Sununu took a stand for the average N.H. taxpayer. With per capita income in our state at roughly $38,000 per year, renewable energy may be out of reach for most of us.
A recent study revealed that 79% of taxpayers who take advantage of the electric vehicle tax credit make over $100,000 per year. That makes it a tax break for the well off. (Fully 70% make over $199,000.)
The governor's veto of HB 365 will forestall yet another tax break for the wealthy – an increase from 1 to 5 megawatts in the size of renewable energy installations that qualify for net metering.
Some will say that municipalities and schools benefit from this bill and will therefore save taxpayers money. But those taxpayers save money only by shifting costs, such as those for renewable energy certificates, to electricity ratepayers in other communities. This bill exempts new renewable installations built after July 1 from the statewide education property tax, adding even more to the burden of other taxpayers.
According to the New York Times, China has 2,300-plus coal-fired electricity plants and 1,100-plus under construction. The U.S. has 365 and none under construction. As long as this imbalance remains, nothing N.H. or U.S. policy makers do will have any impact on our global climate.
The governor was right to protect N.H. ratepayers from these ineffective policies by vetoing HB 365. The House should sustain this veto.

Don't weaken definition  of ‘pet vendor' in N.H.
New Hampshire has some of the weakest animal protection laws in the country. Groups representing breeders are happy to keep it that way. They are opposing the new “pet vendor” definition in the N.H. budget amendment that requires all pet vending entities that transfer over 25 animals per year be held to the same reasonable standards of animal care.
I attended the first Christina Fay trial (80 Great Danes seized) and saw photographs showing the deplorable conditions in which this “expert” breeder kept these animals, heard eyewitness testimony that was even more graphic, and listened when the defendant took the stand and claimed that she'd done nothing wrong and that the Wolfeboro police and community were “out to get her.” I also heard statements to the effect that the reason she came to New Hampshire was because of our weak regulatory laws for dog breeders.
The recent Bradford case (105 golden retriever dogs and puppies seized) is only another example of why we need stronger regulation of dog breeders. Sen. Jeb Bradley and others have bent over backward to listen to stakeholder concerns for the last few years, but the AKC and its members have opposed any reasonable regulations of their members irrespective of the harm to hundreds of animals and a cost of more than $4 million to N.H. towns and nonprofit animal welfare organizations.
So, here's my plea to the N.H. Legislature: Please do not weaken the proposed definition of “pet vendor.” It's easy to enforce and just makes sense.

In Concord, it's time for accountability
The city of Concord is in the news a lot these days, and not for the better. The Concord Monitor, Patch, the New Hampshire Union Leader, Boston TV and WMUR are all reporting on the handling of the case of accused sex-abuser and former special education teacher Howie Leung.
While there is talk that Concord High School Principal Tom Sica is on the outs, as of this writing no one has lost his or her job.
We the citizens of Concord cannot let this matter rest. We must demand school leadership, school board members and school administrators be held to account.
Secrecy has become all too comfortable in our city and was additionally manifest in a “covert” $5,100 purchase for “surveillance technology” by the city council. Some have surmised this purchase is for software to ping cellphones – but we citizens are not even allowed to learn the vendor's name.
It is time to end our school board's unique, autonomous status, politically diversify our school and city boards, and insist on the full truth.
CHUCK McGEE
Concord
Where is the  advantage, Governor?
Regarding the governor's position on paid family medical leave: He views it as another tax on the good citizens of New Hampshire, and that he will not tolerate. In much the same way, he vetoes the net metering bill because of its supposed deleterious effect on the N.H. ratepayers.
Yet, in the same breath, he raves about the “New Hampshire Advantage” and the lowering of business taxes as being beneficial to our state's economic growth. Where is that N.H. advantage when it comes to families having to take unpaid leave to support each other? What advantage do we have if we continue to support a policy that promotes fossil fuels and downplays biomass, solar and other alternative energies? Whom does this governor truly support: big business or the common person? If we are seen as a wealthy state, why isn't that reflected in our education? In our broader health care system? In our concern for others?
Hope you like your insulated office, Governor, isolated from the neediest and our increasingly polluted environment, because your policies, your vetoes, are not for the good of all, and you need to go in 2020.

Texto completo: Last month, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez threw her weight behind a like-minded Democrat, endorsing Tiffany Cabán in Tuesday's primary for district attorney in Queens.
Ms. Ocasio-Cortez not only gave her endorsement, she also implored her legions of online followers to give Ms. Cabán money -- and just like that, small cash contributions poured in from around the country.
The race represents the biggest test yet for the coalition of local activists, reform advocates and democratic socialists who elevated Ms. Ocasio-Cortez from obscurity to Congress -- a run that was itself fueled by money from elsewhere.
This time, the coalition is hoping to prove that Ms. Cabán, a first-time candidate with deeply progressive views on criminal justice, can win in a borough that still retains much of its working-class roots.
They are doing it mostly with money from outside of Queens: Only about 15 percent of the $ 450,000 given to Ms. Cabán in individual contributions -- $ 68,000 -- came from donors who listed an address in Queens, according to an analysis by The New York Times of her filings dating back to January.
About 45 percent of her contributions came from outside of New York City. Nearly $ 100,000 came from California alone.
The race for Queens district attorney, a contest about criminal justice reform, has become a clash between competing visions of how to fund candidates in local elections: sizable checks from local business interests versus small online donations from out of state.
One of Ms. Cabán's leading opponents, Melinda Katz, the Queens borough president, has run a mostly traditional fund-raising effort in her candidacy. She has collected endorsements and cash from major labor unions and local politicians, while amassing a war chest of big donations for over a year from real estate figures and businesses.
That strategy was captured earlier this month at a steakhouse fund-raiser with labor leaders, landlords and lobbyists in Lower Manhattan. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo was billed as a special guest.
Each side has portrayed the other's donors as out of touch with average Queens voters in the primary battle, with the winner expected to be a heavy favorite in November's general election against the Republican candidate, Daniel Kolgan, a lawyer.
"You could make your entire political career out of donors who can't vote for you, but they're typically going to be big donors," said David Fontana, a professor of law at George Washington University, who has written on limitations to out-of-district donations. "Now it's becoming true for smaller donors."
Campaign cash flowing in from other states to influence local elections is nothing new: Wealthy donors in big cities have long supported both Republican and Democratic candidates. Activist billionaires like the Koch brothers and George Soros support local campaigns and issues they care about.
But now those with just a few dollars to spare are getting in on the act. Campaigns have taken notice in recent years, soliciting donations using massive email lists and appeals to a common purpose to fuel small-dollar fund-raising efforts on behalf of candidates in far away places -- especially Democratic ones.
"It's like discovering fire," said Michael Casca, a Democratic strategist and veteran of Senator Bernie Sanders's 2016 run. "The act of kicking in just a few bucks to candidates up and down the ballot in races across the country is creating an unseen level of solidarity in the movement."
The approach was seen in Stacey Abrams's run for governor in Georgia and Beto O'Rourke's challenge to Senator Ted Cruz in Texas, both of whom received huge numbers of small-dollar contributions from around the country during their failed bids.
In the Queens race, Ms. Cabán has amassed by far the largest number of individual donors -- more than 5,000 total and more than 1,100 in Queens -- using regular email solicitations.
Ms. Cabán, a public defender, has refused money from New York City's typical donor class -- businesses, lobbyists and real estate interests -- and made that a key part of her campaign. She has linked her run to a nationwide effort to reform prosecutors' offices that has seen recent success in Philadelphia and the Virginia suburbs of Washington, in part with funds from Mr. Soros.
Monica Klein, a campaign spokeswoman, said it was "no surprise" that Ms. Cabán has attracted support from around the country: "there's a national movement to transform a broken justice system."
Senators Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, both Democratic presidential candidates, endorsed Ms. Cabán on Wednesday. Mr. Sanders did so in an email that also solicited donations for her.
On Friday, the criminal justice reform group funded by Mr. Soros, Justice and Public Safety PAC, entered the Queens race: a $ 70,000 contribution to the Working Families Party, whose members have been actively assisting Ms. Cabán.
The Working Families Party expects to spend close to $ 250,000 on the race, according to Bill Lipton, the party's political director.
"Taking money from the real estate industry has become a fault line in politics for working class and progressive voters -- a marker for who you can trust," Mr. Lipton said.
Those comments were an unsubtle attack on Ms. Katz, the borough president. A veteran politician with deep Queens ties, Ms. Katz had been seen as such a front-runner that a local politics magazine, City and State, put her on the cover on Monday: "Katz in the bag," the headline read.
She entered the year with more than $ 850,000 on hand, and has raised about $ 1 million since. She has taken checks of $ 5,000 or more from developers and landlords; from unions for hotel workers, painters and police captains; from allies of Mr. Cuomo; from the political action committee of Carl E. Heastie, the State Assembly speaker.
The checks are large and largely local: 80 percent of the 390 individual donors who gave Ms. Katz money from mid-January through the latest filing had New York City ZIP codes. Slightly more than half were from Queens.
Grant Fox, a spokesman for Ms. Katz, said her support "among the working men and women of our city" and among many of the biggest unions "will make the difference on the ground in Queens."
Another candidate in the race has received strong support from inside New York City and its suburbs: Greg Lasak, a former chief prosecutor in the Queens district attorney's office and state court judge.
Nearly 97 percent of his donors listed an address in New York State. Mr. Lasak has raised more than $ 1.3 million, including large sums from law firms, the city's largest police union and from associations for court officers and clerks.
Bill Driscoll, the chairman of Mr. Lasak's campaign, attributed the support to the candidate's experience.
In the final days of the race, big checks have flowed mostly to Ms. Katz, who as of Sunday had taken in more than $ 235,000 in contributions over $ 1,000. The largest donations came from the United Federation of Teachers ( $ 36,000), the real estate developer and financier Howard Milstein ( $ 26,000), and Joe for NY ( $ 12,500) -- a state committee for the former Queens congressman Joseph Crowley, who lost his seat last year to Ms. Ocasio-Cortez.
Since the latest filing, Ms. Cabán reported no check greater than $ 1,000 -- and those under that amount are not reported in daily filings. But the Working Families Party, which is supporting her, received $ 125,000 as of Sunday. (Mr. Lasak collected an additional $ 85,000.)
Ms. Cabán is not bereft of large contributors, including $ 38,505 from Cale Bonderman, a Brooklyn-based 26-year-old son of a billionaire investor, and $ 38,000 from Elizabeth Simons, whose address is in California.
Ms. Ocasio-Cortez helped raise $ 14,000 for Ms. Cabán in just a few hours on the day of her endorsement after she sent an email blast soliciting donations.
Ms. Katz, with her steakhouse fund-raiser, did far better. The invite list for that event, at Delmonico's restaurant near Wall Street, included some prominent lobbyists in Albany and New York City, and the Rent Stabilization Association, a landlord group.
She raised over $ 50,000, according to her campaign, a sum perhaps driven by the top billing of Mr. Cuomo as the special guest -- no doubt attracting some of his supporters and donors.
They would have left disappointed: The governor did not attend.

China’s Great Firewall and the end of globalization

Texto completo: The Great Firewall of China—Beijing’s AI-powered website blocker, used to shut down Western media penetration—is spelling an end to the era of globalization. While digital tech encompasses the world, the East and the West have hardened into two separate spheres. There is no looking back.
Through the Great Firewall, China’s leadership has turned off nearly every major English-language news outlet, from the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal on down. The Washington Post and the Guardian, two of the last survivors, were zeroed our in time for the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre.
Social media has not been spared. All the big US platforms and services, Google, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, are access denied; group chat applications like WhatsApp are firmly out of reach.
Companies including Google have struggled, sometimes secretly, to figure out how to get back into the Chinese market, even if it means working on much cozier or even riskier terms with the country’s military than Americans—and their own workers—are ready to tolerate. The dream of one globally integrated world, networks and ultimately controlled by the masters of the internet, dies hard.
But it has died. Nowhere is the digital divide between East and West sharper than it is where Hong Kong stops and the rest of China begins. Rebellion against a draconian extradition law that would see Hong Kong residents spirited away to the mainland for punishment made national Western headlines, with huge crowds spilling into the streets—and voluntarily shutting down their own online activity to frustrate or defeat Chinese monitoring.
That’s a long way from the days of the Arab Spring, when autocratic regimes put their internets on lockdown to stop protests from mobilizing into more serious political opposition. Today, governments have learned how to reassert sovereignty over their digital domains—not just how to pull the plug.
But for China the two are hardly mutually exclusive. The goal is no Western media, just as Western religion, which is seen to breed rampant heresy, instability, and factionalism, is being all but expunged from the country. China’s digital plan is to remoralize its billion-plus population before venality and vice wrecks civil society.
That’s frighteningly Orwellian to the West. In China, by contrast, the Orwellian imagination is unwelcome: both the fear of servility and the fear of mastery at the heart of 1984. Technological times have changed since Orwell’s day—digital rule is about the triumph of machine memory, not of Big Brother’s compulsory fantasies—but in the West, the dystopian vision endures. In China, no such millennia-old tradition of the slavery-and-mastery morality play exists.
It’s not that the Chinese can have no appreciation for freedom, of course; it’s that their experience with digital will simply not shape them and be shaped by them in the same way as we in the West will ours.
That alone marks a harsh lesson for Western elites. Those clinging bitterly to certitudes that more modernization, more money, or more engagement will eventually bring down the autocratic regime in favor of Western-style democracy are indulging in a fantasy every bit as dangerous as 2 + 2 = 5.
In technology, leading Westerners are beside themselves to see Chinese researchers and companies being squeezed out from American positions. But China has so penetrated strategic American tech and science that it would be negligent at best not to do so.
In academia, leading Westerners fear that the loss of lucrative Chinese students and access to brilliant Chinese graduate students will gobble America’s development of next-generation tools and patents. But the West has grown too lazy and comfortable leaning on outside talent while home-grown students become over-credentialed and under-employable ingrates with a resentful sense of entitlement and little game plan for the future.
And in entertainment media, leading Westerners have grown similarly dependent on “international”—read Chinese—audiences to prop up box office numbers, make movies marketable and produceable, and sustain the illusion that Hollywood and its power brokers hold real cultural authority in America and beyond. But the reality of a contracting and consolidating industry with little to say about life besides formulaic and narrow-cast cultural politics is inescapable.
The message China has sent the West’s elite, in other words, is painfully simple: you need us more than we need you. And the West agrees. It is Western elites, not Chinese ones, who are still hung up on the utopian dream of creating one harmonious and standardized world. China’s bid for international power hinges on its domestic priorities of preventing chaos, civil strife, and the collapse of its sovereignty; if Beijing thought it could lock its power in and fully establish state morality through the populace without a hugely risky intercontinental economic and infrastructure program, it likely would have gone in that direction. It didn’t.
And the West? It harbors three leading assets over the Chinese: its media apparatus, its military capability, and its financial power. Of these, the first has effectively been neutralized in China. The third is holding steady, but the second is showing cracks in its mystique. If China can use technology to make its absolute sovereign control over its culture and morality complete, it will consider itself to have the upper hand.
And if the West continues to fragment into weak and Balkanized camps dominated by bureaucratic revolutionaries at odds with their country’s histories and cultures, and ultimately their own countrymen, the Chinese will be right.

Texto completo: A British judge authorized doctors to perform an abortion on a pregnant London woman with learning and mood disorders after determining that it is in her best interests, according to reports.
The woman, who has not been publicly identified, is 22 weeks pregnant, in her 20s and has the "mental capacity of a 6- to 9-year-old child," the New York Times reported. Justice Nathalie Lieven issued the ruling in the Court of Protection, which makes decisions on financial or serious health care matters for people who “lack the mental capacity” to make their own decisions.
“I am acutely conscious of the fact that for the state to order a woman to have a termination where it appears that she doesn’t want it is an immense intrusion,” Lieven said in her decision.
'Heartbeat' bills: Does it seem like abortion bans are sweeping the US? Thank copy and paste.
Lieven called the evidence “heartbreaking,” but said she had to act in the woman’s “best interests, not on society’s views of termination,” according to the Times.
Abortion before 24 weeks of pregnancy was made legal in England, Wales and Scotland under the 1967 Abortion Act. Pregnancy can be terminated after 24 weeks under certain circumstances; for example, if the mother's life is at risk or the child may be born with a severe disability.
The court was told the “circumstances of the conception (were) unclear,” and police are investigating how the woman got pregnant, British news outlet The Independent reported.
'A duty to prevent future harm': Missouri won't renew license of St. Louis Planned Parenthood, state's last abortion clinic
The National Health Service trust which oversees the woman’s care requested the court’s permission for doctors to perform the abortion, according to the Independent. The woman’s mother, identified by the media as a former midwife from Nigeria, as well as a social worker and lawyers acting on behalf of the woman argued that the pregnancy should not be terminated.
The woman’s mother offered to care for the child with help from her daughter, but the judge said social workers were unlikely to accept that scenario due to the "risks posed by the woman’s psychological limitations," The Independent reported.
Abortion rates down: Fewer women are having abortions. Why?
The judge said she believes the woman would suffer “greater trauma” if the baby had to be removed and placed into foster care or put up for adoption.
“It would at that stage be a real baby,” Lievens said. “Pregnancy, although real to her, doesn’t have a baby outside her body that she can touch. ”
Lievens added that although evidence indicated the woman wanted to keep the baby, she likely had no sense of what having a child means.
“I think she would like to have a baby in the same way she would like to have a nice doll,” Lievens said.
Opinion: My rapist fought for custody of my daughter. States can't keep survivors tied to rapists.

Texto completo: 'A Portrait In Four Movements'
By Andrew Patner, University of Chicago Press, 253 pages, $27.50
Andrew Patner, you were no Lester Bangs.
Bangs, the famed rock critic, thrust his acerbic, infuriating personality so vividly into his reviews that you might walk away knowing more about the critic than the music.
Neither, Mr. Patner, were you a Claudia Cassidy, aka Acidy Cassidy. The infamous Chicago critic used her skills like a lance to skewer those she believed unworthy of her inky praise, or even a career.
Bangs and Cassidy personified critics whose joy, it seemed, came as much from tearing down as building up.
That was not Patner's way.
His joy began with the music, and then sharing the music with readers and listeners, opening windows to art and culture, with missionary zeal.
"It's magic," he wrote about Bernard Haitink's Beethoven with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. "When these master musicians turn their full attention to one another and to Beethoven in such a concentrated way, you are reminded of why you are here -- here in this hall and even here on this earth."
Andrew Patner left this earth in 2015 -- suddenly, unexpectedly and tragically -- at 55.
Patner had already accomplished plenty. While still in his 20s, Pantheon published, "I.F. Stone: APortrait." He eventually collected degrees from the universities of Chicago and Wisconsin-Madison, and did a brief stint with The Wall Street Journal before coming to the Chicago Sun-Times in 1991 as a freelance arts critic. Four years later, he became the newspaper's full-time classical music critic. Patner also was a familiar voice on radio stations WBEZ and WFMT.
"A Portrait in Four Movements" a new volume published by University of Chicago Press, collects Patner's work covering each of the conductors who have led the Chicago Symphony Orchestra since 1991: Daniel Barenboim, Pierre Boulez, Bernard Haitink, and Riccardo Muti.
Patner understood and respected each of them, and the respect flowed both ways. He was someone they took seriously.
"He knew everything. Everything," Muti said in the closing chapter, "Afterword: Riccardo Muti Remembers Andrew Patner."
"Sometimes in life, you can learn from reviews ... if you respect the critic," Muti continued. "It does not happen very often. Andrew was this kind of critic."
Patner knew his audience. When Haitink explains in some detail his method of preparing to conduct a work, hardcore classical geeks will eat it up, while more casual readers should find enough of interest to not skip ahead. Patner's work reached everyone from novices to the performers themselves.
His interviewing elicited answers beyond boilerplate, with short and erudite follow-up comments moving the discussion forward, offering candid insights.
Or a good chuckle.
When Muti talks about old Italian cemeteries, he quips, "They are so scary that even the dead people want to get out."
Boulez was an antagonistic firebrand in his youth ("Blow up the opera houses!") with a reputation as an uncompromising purist. So when Patner asked him why he programmed a thorny piece by composer Anton Webern to precede the massive Mahler 7th Symphony, the reader might reasonably await some insight into the inner workings of Webern.
The insight? "That's because people can come late."
Latecomers are seated only during breaks between pieces or movements, so they would "only" miss the Webern, not the 30-minute Mahler opening movement. So now we know: At heart, Boulez was a pragmatist.
The interviews in "A Portrait in Four Movements" often read like relaxed conversations over drinks, even as they are guided by Patner's subtle hand.
When Muti says, "There is an element of caritas," Patner's response of, "Caritas, charity," leads Muti to a more precise description: "Charity. It's like a caress." When Muti mentions the Basilica of Saint Denis, Patner -- relevantly -- knows who is buried there. And when Muti talks about intersections of art and music, Patner adds 16th-century Venetian painters Tizaiano and Tintoretto to the discussion, fleshing out Muti's examples.
Patner was the real deal, strong enough to be gentle, a velvet glove over an iron hand.
He brought the same qualities to being an editor. Shortly before his death, Patner asked me to contribute classical reviews to the Sun-Times as a freelancer. Like the best editors, Patner's tweaks improved a story without changing the writer's voice -- and also taught you something about writing.
Because, in essence, he was a generous and eager teacher. He did not approach music as mere entertainment. For Patner, music was lifeblood for a rich and meaningful existence, and his role was to share it. We were -- and now with this book, are -- the fortunate beneficiaries.

Texto completo: President Trump is expected to soon announce his intention to nominate Army Secretary Mark T. Esper to serve permanently as his secretary of defense, a senior administration official said Friday, as the Pentagon faces a leadership vacuum amid a mounting confrontation with Iran.
The decision comes as lawmakers increasingly pressure the president to bring stable civilian leadership to the Pentagon, where it has been absent since Jim Mattis abruptly resigned as defense secretary late last year.
The senior official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss personnel matters that haven't been made public.
The need for a confirmed defense secretary became more pronounced Thursday, as Trump considered a military strike on Iran in retaliation for the downing of a U.S. reconnaissance drone but ultimately backed down over what he said was his concern about Iranian casualties.
Esper, after studying in the same U.S. Military Academy class as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, began a long career as an Army infantryman that included serving in the 1991 Persian Gulf War. He later became a Washington insider, honing his defense policy skills as an adviser to Republican lawmakers, a top civilian Pentagon official, a top official at a conservative think tank, a lobbyist for defense contractor Raytheon and most recently the top civilian overseeing the U.S. Army.
His deep understanding of Washington's inner workings marks a stark contrast to the background of acting defense secretary Patrick Shanahan, who joined the Pentagon after decades of working in the private sector at Boeing and entered government without a military background or the long-standing relationships typical of high-level Defense Department officials.
News of Trump's intent to nominate Esper was first reported by the New York Times.
Trump intended to nominate Shanahan for the post, but the former Boeing executive withdrew from consideration this week as reports surfaced about his contentious divorce, including an incident in 2011 when his son attacked his ex-wife with a baseball bat. Shanahan's last day is Sunday.
After Shanahan bowed out, Trump said Tuesday that he would "most likely" nominate Esper. "That's what I'm thinking about doing," the president said.
Sen. James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.), the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, told reporters that he spoke to Trump on Thursday morning and received word that the president was planning to pick a new defense secretary soon. Inhofe suggested that the president told him Esper was his choice, according to Politico.
Esper, 55, served in the 101st Airborne Division during the Gulf War and later commanded an airborne rifle company in Europe, receiving the Legion of Merit and a Bronze Star, according to his official Army biography. He gained policy experience working for Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill, including as national security adviser to then-Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) and as policy director for the House Armed Services Committee.
He left government and served as chief of staff at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, and then in the defense industry, first as the chief operating officer of the Aerospace Industries Association and later as vice president of government relations for the defense contractor Raytheon. He also held positions as executive vice president for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Global Intellectual Property Center and as its vice president for Europe and Eurasian affairs.

Texto completo: If you want to keep a secret from the general public, a blog post about accelerating gender parity in globalization is probably a good place to hide it. Even a nerd like me recognizes that it can be hard to turn a new analysis of gender data into clickbait.
I'm going to try anyway, though, because in a blog post this week, the World Economic Forum released a new projection that demands our attention.
Based on data from its widely-respected Global Gender Gap Index, WEF estimates that it will take the United States another 208 years to reach gender equality. You read that right. At the current pace of change, gender equality won't arrive in the U.S. until the year 2227.
Although women now earn college and graduate degrees at higher rates than men, they remain concentrated in certain majors and, early in their careers, they are often channeled into less lucrative jobs. Men are 70% more likely to be executives than women their same age. In 2018, there were more Fortune 500 CEOs named James than there were women. WEF's projection also reflects the grim reality that the U.S. is the only industrialized nation where maternal mortality rates are actually getting worse.
While 208 is a damning, daunting number, it is not destiny. The projection is based on the assumption that the rate of change will remain constant. I know from experience that a startling statistic can be an animating force. About 25 years ago, Bill and I learned from a New York Times article that in developing countries, hundreds of thousands of children were dying of diarrhea each year. Bill and I had already decided that we wanted to give the majority of the wealth from Microsoft away, but until that article, we weren't sure how. That data point gave us direction and ultimately led us to start our foundation.
Once again, we find ourselves facing an urgent challenge that calls for new investment and collaboration. Shrinking the number 208 is going to require many people across many sectors. But I believe progress is possible, and as a philanthropist, I'm particularly interested in the role that philanthropy can play in accelerating it.
While comprehensive data on U.S. philanthropy is hard to find, there's evidence that gender equality in the U.S. has been chronically underfunded. Preliminary, unpublished research based on foundation data from Candid suggests that for every $1 spent on gender equality by private donors, there is $9.27 spent on higher education, and $4.85 spent on the arts.
When it comes to the fight for gender equality, one of the most important assets we have is the huge array of people who are already activated. That's why I think there's a lot of potential in new efforts to channel existing energies and expertise more effectively into one broad-based assault on systemic inequality.
The gender gaps in our country are real, and they aren't going away on their own. If we want to see them close in our lifetimes, we will need to come together to insist in one voice that equality can't wait. Over two decades ago, a statistic in a newspaper called me to action. I hope the statistic WEF published this week does the same for others. If we commit to being part of the solution, the number 208 is ours to reject.

Family secrets: Which to keep and others to share

Texto completo: Family secrets, every family has them. But should your estate plan be one of those secrets?
In my law practice, I am often asked by parents if they should provide a copy of their estate planning documents to their adult child(ren), or at least discuss the plan with them. And the typical lawyer answer I give is “it depends.” And it does.
It depends on the ages of those folks; whether you’re likely to make significant changes in the future; if there is anything unusual in your plan; whether anyone is being disinherited or inheriting less than what they might expect; and your relationship with the heirs and beneficiaries in general.
There are, however, some general rules.
What not to keep secret
Someone besides you (and your spouse, if applicable) should know where your documents are stored.
By the time your will, trust, health care directive, or power of attorney is needed, you are either deceased or incapacitated, so you won’t be available to hand over keys or combinations or directions to your secret storage spot.
Generally, it’s not a good idea to keep your documents in a bank safe deposit box either — access to these is notoriously difficult and they can’t be reached as quickly as may be needed in an emergency.
Your heirs and beneficiaries should know which attorney drafted your documents and how to reach them.
It’s a good idea to inform your heirs who you’ve put in charge when you’re gone. The trustee of your trust will have immediate duties and responsibilities. It’s good for them to be aware of their role ahead of time so they are prepared and willing to act.
The job of trustee is a big one — it’s not necessarily an “honor.” Thus, let them all know whom you’ve selected and why. You might find out the person you chose doesn’t want to serve, or the others object to that choice for very valid reasons.
I once had a client choose one child as trustee because the other four children “liked” that child. But during the family meeting to review the plan with all the children, it became clear that while they may have liked that child, they did not respect him. We could all see he wasn’t likely to act fairly either. Luckily, it was also apparent there was one child they all did respect. We made the change immediately.
If you are disinheriting a child or leaving one child less than the others, it’s generally a good idea to make that known ahead of time as well as your reasons for doing so. If you aren’t comfortable telling that child directly, let your attorney and your other children, and perhaps a trusted friend or adviser, know your reasons for the disinheritance. You may be able to avoid a costly fight later.
Secrets you might keep
You may want to keep the dispositive provisions of your estate plan (i.e. who gets what and when) confidential. Your children don’t need to know if you’ve left a charitable gift in addition to what you’ve left them, or how much you have, or that you’ve left the grandchildren something as well. Those things often change over time.
If you’re concerned about the spending habits of the spouse of one of your children, or the possibility of a child divorcing, you can arrange for that child’s share to be held in trust to maintain its separate property status (in California). That might be awkward to bring up at a family dinner, so you don’t have to go into details. You can simply let your child know you’ve provided for them in a trust that will give them creditor protection. (“Creditor” includes future ex-spouses, but doesn’t “creditor protection” sound so much nicer?).
Your list of assets and liabilities isn’t something anyone needs to know currently. But there should be a list (often it’s attached to your trust) and contact information readily available so that the trustee or agent acting under a power of attorney can spring into action when needed.
Many times I’ve seen family members struggle to find out where the bank accounts are, whether there was a mortgage on the house, and if there was any insurance, for weeks and months, which causes a delay in the entire administration process and unnecessary stress during an already stressful time.
Don’t take it to the grave
Finally, you’d be doing your family members a great favor if you talked about your wishes for end-of-life care and memorial services. It’s a difficult topic, but an important one. Talk about whether you want to be an organ donor, your desires for pain medication, life support and CPR.
If you prefer cremation or burial, let your loved ones know. The more plans you make on your own, including pre-paid burial arrangements, and share with your loved ones, the less their burden will be when they are grieving your loss. They’ll be able to focus on celebrating you and your life, your final gift to them.

Texto completo: Re: "The other side," June 18 letter to the editor
I just read this and would like to set the record straight with facts.
The Republicans have spent $100 million of taxpayer money investigating Hillary Clinton with not one conviction. The Mueller Report cost around $25 million, but stands to "gain" about $46 million from Paul Manafort alone.
I would like to ask if the previous letter writer even bothered to read the Mueller Report.
The investigation produced 200 criminal charges on 37 people and seven guilty pleas, with dozens of sealed indictments to come.
As far as his charge of "Fake News," I would like one example form The New York Times, Washington Post, CNN or MSNBC that has been proven false with their reporting about the corruption, the lies of Donald Trump, his family and his administration.
Jennifer Geer, Indio
Preparing for wildfire season We must devise a much more aggressive and progressive attitude towards these deadly fires that are sure to take more lives this season.
We must start thinning forests, clearing heavy underbrush, enlarging fire breaks and devising better early detection and warnings.
The Japanese and other nations with tsunamis have sirens that are strategically placed. These could be set off and would help so many.
Most of us no longer have landline phones, so a calling system is useless. Drone stations should be implemented to cover massive areas to alert and we need to find a serious retardant that can be used from helicopters.
Why our state has not addressed this horrific problem, that kills many and deprives them of their homes and livelihoods, is beyond me. The pollution from these fires is another whole story.

Texto completo: Support for “Medicare for all” — the marketing rebrand of government-run, single-payer healthcare — has become a litmus test for Democratic candidates for president.
One prominent progressive, Sean McElwee, founder of Data For Progress, declared, “There is no viable path to the Democratic nomination for someone who does not support single-payer health care.”
Yet when voters and America’s patients understand the devastating impacts of this policy, Democrats may rethink their support.
Consider Medicare for All’s potential impact on rural hospitals. Policy experts estimate that under Medicare for All, reimbursement rates for rural hospitals would be slashed by 40% below current payment rates. My home state of Kansas has 83 rural hospitals — the second-largest number in the country. They are currently reimbursed at just 101% of cost. At this reimbursement rate, many rural hospitals are struggling financially to keep their doors open.
At a recent U.S. House Ways and Means Committee hearing, I asked Galen Institute President Grace-Marie Turner about how the slashing of this reimbursement rate would affect rural hospitals in my state and across the country.
She responded, “I think that the rural hospitals would be among the most vulnerable, because they often are relying even more now on Medicare and Medicaid payments and have fewer private people supporting them. ... If you put all of them on these much lower government payment rates, it's very hard to see how most of them would be able to keep their doors open.”
Turner’s warning is in line with information not only from conservatives, but from the New York Times as well. In April, the Times reported that rural hospitals “would try to offset the steep cuts by laying off hundreds of thousands of workers and abandoning lower-paying services like mental health.”
The impacts of Medicare for All would go well beyond rural hospitals and mental health services.
The bill explicitly declares that “no employee benefit plan may provide benefits that duplicate payment for any items or services for which payment may be made under Medicare” (Title VIII, Section 801 of the Medicare for All Act of 2017). This draconian provision is effectively a ban on private insurance, which one leading Democratic candidate for president, Kamala Harris, proudly endorsed.
Democrats used to claim that if you like your plan you can keep it. Now they’re promising that if you like your plan, they’re going to eliminate it.
Remember that under the Affordable Care Act (better known as Obamacare), nearly 5 million Americans were kicked off their plans. Under Medicare for All, nearly 158 million Americans could lose their private insurance. That’s hardly “progressive.”
Medicare for All, again, is all about marketing. It is portrayed as an expansion of the positive aspects of Medicare. In reality, it’s about elimination rather than expansion. It would eliminate Medicare as we know it, repeal private insurance and replace it with single-payer, government-run healthcare.
More government is not the answer. In Britain, which has a "Medicare for all" single-payer system, 1 in 5 cancer patients have to wait more than two months for treatment after being referred from a general practitioner. In Canada, which is also hailed as a shining example of single-payer healthcare, the median wait time is 19.8 weeks for patients to see a specialist after receiving a referral from a general practitioner. Canadians also have median wait times of 4.3 weeks for a CT scan, 10.6 weeks for an MRI, and 3.9 weeks for an ultrasound.
Medicare for All would be more like Medicaid for All or VA Care for All, in that it would force everyone into a system already crippled by long wait times.
Government now dominates about 80% of our health are spending. Government’s reach has expanded in the last decade. As a result, the healthcare industry has been thrown into chaos. Costs have risen, and choices have disappeared.
Instead of giving government 100% control and pushing one-size-fits-all solutions, it’s past time to empower patients with choice and access. The problem is not that the market has failed, but that a bureaucratic government has gotten in the way of quality, affordable patient care. It’s time to create innovative market solutions that will truly empower patients in all areas of America, rural and otherwise.

Democracy in Trump era is dying tweet by tweet and we won't see the big picture for years

Texto completo: In the late 1800s, Georges Seurat and Paul Signac developed an innovative painting technique that came to be known as pointillism. The technique involves placing thousands of individual dots of color on a canvas, which when viewed from a distance, form a cohesive image. When viewed up close, however, all one can see is individual, brightly colored dots of paint.
Trump’s rhetoric is like a pointillist painting. Each tweet (along with the occasional TV sound bite) is an individual, brightly colored dot of paint. Unfortunately, the dots themselves are so colorful (read: an affront to the rule of law and/or basic human decency), so numerous, and so frequent that it is often difficult to discern larger patterns and to make out the full picture, which paints the destruction of democracy by attacking our most cherished and fundamental norms, principles, and institutions.
I am acutely aware of the fact that the preceding sentence ‘sounds’ alarmist and hyperbolic. This, I have found, is the chief challenge in writing about Trump’s rhetoric . . . commentary about Trump’s discourse, much like a Trump tweet itself, often sounds like an exaggeration. But it only sounds like an exaggeration because of the way Trump packages his rhetoric, namely in the form of 280-character dabs of paint.
Trump's tweets obscure the big picture
Because Trump tweets and speaks in micro-messages, it is easy for his defenders to dismiss their significance (no matter how tortured those defenses may be; remember “alternative facts”), not to mention exceedingly difficult to grasp the full weight of their collective destructive power.
The president’s tweets are structured as a “feed,” so one can only see a handful of them at a time on the screen. Moreover, his most destructive tweets are picked up in the media and amplified many times over, which distracts from his previous tweets. In other words, the very form of the messaging (Twitter plus the rapid and continuously shifting news cycle) makes it exceedingly difficult to achieve the perspective needed to see the larger picture. Increasingly, there are voices pointing to this bigger picture, but those warnings are themselves often drowned out by the latest news cycle.
Trump tries to break the rules. . . again: Trump calls foreign intelligence 'oppo research. ' I call it illegal, and I should know.
The intense news focus this month on Trump’s comments about accepting aid from a hostile foreign power to win an election, while truly disturbing, distracts from his truly disturbing discourse about his political opponents, which distracts from his truly disturbing discourse about authoritarians like Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un, which distracts from his truly disturbing discourse about white nationalists, which distracts from his truly disturbing discourse about the mainstream news media, which distracts from his truly disturbing discourse about our intelligence agencies, which distracts from his truly disturbing discourse about immigration.
And lest one forget, all of this rhetoric has real, material consequences. His immigration language, for example, led to inhumane policies and practices that include separating children from their parents, locking children up in cage-like conditions, and in a few cases even death.
But, and I can’t believe I’m writing this sentence, it’s easy to forget about the migrant children who have died in U. S. custody because the president admitted on national television his willingness to accept foreign intelligence to win an election.
Trump's treason claim: It comes as leaks show Washington is desperate — about him
Sadly, two weeks from now we won’t be talking about the president’s open admission of his willingness to commit crimes to be re-elected just like we’re not talking now about deceased immigrant children because he will have tweeted or said something equally horrific.
America after Trump will be unrecognizable
That bears repeating: Two weeks from now, we likely won’t be talking about the president’s revelation that he’s willing to break the law or his racist discourse on immigration, which has led to the deaths of migrant children in U. S. custody, because he will have tweeted or said something equally offensive, cruel, and undemocratic.
Almost immediately, in fact, the president’s open admission of his willingness to commit crimes to be reelected was driven out of the public view as the news cycle transitioned to new rhetorical horrors (accusing The New York Times of treason, announcing the mass deportation of “millions of illegal aliens”) and, on Thursday, tweeting that "Iran made a very big mistake!"
This is the power and extraordinary danger of Trump’s rhetoric. While it may look like little more than dabs of paint, coming as it does in colorful microbursts on Twitter and TV, it is more accurately described as precision-guided bombs, bombs that are dropped on American norms, principles, and institutions week after week. But we never see the full extent of the destruction wrought by these rhetorical bombs because we don’t see them as bombs at all, and we certainly don’t see them all at once.
By the time that we can see the full picture of the U. S. that Trump has created, I fear that it will be nearly unrecognizable to us.

Texto completo: The New York Times, GQ and other national tastemakers have made a hobby of heaping all kinds of attention and adulation on the Twin Cities food scene.
"We were floored by how Minneapolis was inspiring excitement about Midwestern food the way Nashville was Southern food," reads a particularly enthusiastic rave, from Saveur magazine in 2015, which dubbed Minneapolis "America's next great food city."
One gauge is the number of Twin Cities chefs who have found themselves on the cover of Food & Wine magazine's Best New Chefs issue since 2005, including Jim Christiansen (the former Heyday), Jamie Malone of Grand Cafe (during her Sea Change tenure), Stewart Woodman (the former Heidi's, now with Food Trip Foods) and Seth Bixby Daugherty (during his time at Cosmos, now at Seven).
But let's just focus on 2018, when the lovefest went on, and on. "It's snowing and 10 degrees outside and there's never been a better time to head to Minnesota," gushed Food & Wine in January. Four months later the glossy named Grand Cafe one of the country's 10 best new restaurants, and awarded its dish of the year accolades on chef Jamie Malone's savory Paris-Brest, splashing it across the magazine's cover. In August, F&W singled out Spoon and Stable as one of the 40 most important restaurants of the past 40 years.
In May, Far & Away, a joint effort between National Geographic and the Wall Street Journal, crowned Minneapolis-St. Paul "America's coolest drinking city." In November, Esquire magazine showered all kinds of love on the metro area, naming Hai Hai one of the country's 20 best new restaurants, and christening chef/co-owner Christina Nguyen its rising star of the year. The magazine also bestowed beverage director of the year honors on Marco Zappia of Martina and restaurant resurrection of the year on Grand Cafe.
On the web, Eater, the national dining-focused website, hailed Spoon and Stable as one of America's 38 essential restaurants and Hai Hai as one of the nation's 18 best new restaurants. Even non-foodie titles got in the act. In June, People magazine highlighted the skills and creative chops of two Twin Citians: Michelle Gayer of the Salty Tart and Diane Moua of Spoon and Stable and Bellecour. In December, Us Weekly magazine crowned Hai Hai, Spoon and Stable and Bellecour as three of the nation's 100 best restaurants.
Even this month's Bon Apptit joined the conversation, raving about how diners "can take a world tour without leaving Minnesota" in an enthusiastic spread that guides readers on a travelogue from Kurdistan (Babani's) to Scandinavia (Fika) to Somalia (Quruxlow).

Yo-Yo Ma's Sister Continues Her Family's Legacy

Texto completo: In 1962, Leonard Bernstein, presiding over a fund-raiser in Washington called American Pageant for the Arts, introduced a 7-year-old cellist named Yo-Yo Ma. Among the honored guests were President John F. Kennedy -- Jacqueline, too -- and Dwight D. Eisenhower.
Yo-Yo, who had arrived to the United States from Paris a year earlier with his family, Bernstein said, would now perform the first movement of a concertino by Jean-Baptiste Bréval, accompanied at the piano by his 11-year-old sister, Yeou-Cheng Ma -- who, Bernstein added, was "pursuing her musical studies."
Their performance, which was televised (and can be seen online), was remarkable.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
What Bernstein did not mention was that Yeou-Cheng's primary instrument was the violin. Like her brother, she was a prodigy. At 10, she had performed the Mendelssohn Violin Concerto with the Denver Symphony.
But around that time, with little explanation, her parents ended her violin lessons. She continued with piano, however, and for the next decade was her brother's primary accompanist. Already, it seemed, she was being directed away from a solo career and into a supportive role for Yo-Yo, now the world's leading cellist.
In 1962, the same year as the Washington performance, their father, Dr. Hiao-Tsiun Ma, a conductor, musicologist and teacher, founded the Children's Orchestra Society in New York. That orchestra will celebrate its 50th anniversary -- there was a seven-year hiatus from the late-1970s to the early '80s -- with a gala concert at Carnegie Hall on Thursday, including Rimsky-Korsakov's "Scheherazade" and works by Koussevitzky and Bruch.
When he founded the orchestra, Dr. Ma hoped that one of his children would take it over some day. That mission wound up falling to Yeou-Cheng, who in 1984 became the orchestra's executive director even while working full-time as a developmental pediatrician at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Her husband, Michael Dadap -- a guitarist, composer and conductor -- is the orchestra's artistic director.
This is not the way Dr. Ma -- Yeou-Cheng, that is -- imagined her life in music unfolding when she was a child. She never considered taking over the orchestra following the retirement of her father in 1977 (which led to the hiatus). Everything changed when she met Mr. Dadap.
"Michael was a touring musician," Dr. Ma, 67, said in an interview. "When we were courting, trying to decide what to do about family, I asked him if he was going to continue touring. He said he would really like to have either a music school or a children's orchestra. He didn't even know that I had this organization!"
The orchestra restarted with less than 20 students. Then word spread quickly.
"Someone started the rumor that Yo-Yo Ma's sister was having an orchestra in Queens, and it was free," Dr. Ma said. "It was actually $ 25 a semester back then -- just enough to print the music for the students."
It's "a blessing that I have my brother as my brother," she said. "He's very famous, so that always attracts attention. But we never said he was part of it."
With steady work and endless fund-raising, the Children's Orchestra Society grew. It now has an enrollment of about 145 students, mostly drawn from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, and operates four orchestra divisions and numerous chamber ensembles. Mr. Dadap and Dr. Ma run the institution out of their house in Queens. Most rehearsals take place at the Long Island High School for the Arts in Syosset.
Over the years, Dr. Ma has reduced her schedule as a doctor to devote more time to the orchestra. She teaches and coaches students, and occasionally performs concerts. She also actively plays chamber music with friends.
Being essentially sidelined as a violinist at 11 was hurtful and confusing back then. The violin "was my voice," she said in a 1994 interview with The New York Times. "I couldn't stand it. All that work, and then, nothing."
But today she expresses contentment with the course of her life. She believes deeply in the mission of the Children's Orchestra Society, which auditions all applicants but accepts everyone regardless of talent.
"That goes back to the principle my father espoused, that music is a language," Dr. Ma said. "So our verbal logo is 'teaching children the language of music.' Very few children cannot learn a language. So, music should be accessible rather than exclusive."
Dr. Ma estimates that a few thousand students have passed through the Children's Orchestra Society during the years she has been involved. Many young lives have been enriched by the association; Dr. Ma recalls one especially.
"At the time he was an angry teenager, so he wasn't very appreciative of our program," she said. "Then he became a missionary. His mom got sick, and we visited with him, and he said something amazing: 'Michael and Yeou-Cheng not only taught us to love music, they taught us how to love.' I find that excruciatingly touching."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump's campaign has decided to purge some of its pollsters after a leak of dismal internal polls for the president that he denied existed.
Just two days before the president is set to kick off his bid for re-election, a top adviser said on Sunday that the campaign was cutting ties with three of its five pollsters to prevent further disclosure of survey data.
The polling showed Trump behind former Vice President Joe Biden in several key battleground states, including by double digits in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. The results were confirmed to The New York Times by advisers to Trump, but when they became public, he called them "fake polls."
For days, aides to Trump have tried to figure out whom to point the finger at over the leak of the data, which jolted and infuriated the president. But in continuing to discuss it, aides violated a long-held unofficial rule of campaigns not to comment publicly on internal polling, even if the numbers leak.
The resulting furor led to an effort by the campaign manager, Brad Parscale, to tighten control. By removing several pollsters, the campaign hopes to shrink the circle of outside operatives who have access to information that could leak, according to the presidential adviser, who was not authorized to speak publicly.
The rupture of the team came even as the president and his advisers were preparing for a large and elaborate rally in Orlando, Florida, on Tuesday night to formally open his campaign for a second term. Trump was hoping for a show of strength as Democrats had drawn increasing attention before their first debates on June 26 and 27.
The internal poll numbers, while not predictive, painted a bleak picture of the current state of the race for Trump, at least against Biden, when they were taken in March. They showed a number of critical states at risk - not just Florida and the Midwestern states, but even some longtime Republican bastions like Georgia. A Democratic state that Trump's aides have insisted they want to put in play, Minnesota, appeared out of reach for the president.
The polling was reported on by The Times nearly two months ago without citing specific numbers. Last week, The Times reported that Trump had told aides to deny that such polls existed and to say that other data in the survey showed him doing well.
Some aides to the president appeared to be using the episode to undermine one of the president's closest advisers, Kellyanne Conway, who was Trump's final campaign manager in 2016 and is now his White House counselor. Conway's relationship with Trump, and the praise he has given her for his 2016 victory, have long stirred envy among other advisers to the president. Her former firm, the Polling Co., was one of the ones to be ousted. Conway no longer has any formal ties to the company, which was sold in 2017 to CRC Public Relations, a well-known conservative advocacy firm.
In addition to Conway's former firm, the Trump adviser said the campaign would cut ties with Adam Geller, a pollster for former Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, and Michael Base-lice, a pollster for former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California, both late additions to Trump's campaign in 2016.
NBC News first reported the decision to oust the pollsters, although it did not identify which ones. Two other pollsters, Tony Fabrizio and John McLaughlin, will remain with the campaign. Fabrizio conducted the March survey for Trump. As a pollster, he worked for Trump's company many years ago, but he was brought into the 2016 campaign by Paul Manafort, Trump's former campaign chairman, who was one of the people charged by the special counsel, Robert Mueller. McLaughlin has known Trump for years and did informal work for him in 2011 when the real estate developer was considering running for president.
Fabrizio and Conway declined to comment. McLaughlin and the other pollsters did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
In recent weeks, Trump has angrily denied receiving polls showing him losing or instructing aides to deny them. "Those polls don't exist," Trump told ABC News in an interview broadcast on Thursday. "I just had a meeting with somebody that's a pollster and I'm winning everywhere, so I don't know what you're talking about."
But on Friday, ABC reported specific information from that supposedly fake polling. The data obtained by ABC showed Biden leading Trump 55%-39% in Pennsylvania, 51%-41% in Wisconsin and by 7 points in Florida. The president was leading in Texas, a bulwark for Republican presidential candidates for four decades, by just 2 points.
When approached by the network with the numbers, Parscale confirmed that they were accurate, but dismissed them as outdated, insisting that the president's public standing had subsequently been helped by Attorney General William Barr's initial characterization of the special counsel's report. A redacted version of Mueller's report has since been released, showing that it was not as favorable as Barr suggested.
"These leaked numbers are ancient, in campaign terms, from months-old polling that began in March before two major events had occurred: the release of the summary of the Mueller report exonerating the president, and the beginning of the Democrat candidates defining themselves with their far-left policy message," Parscale said in a statement on Friday.
"Since then, we have seen huge swings in the president's favor across the 17 states we have polled, based on the policies now espoused by the Democrats," he said. "The president is correct that we have no current polls against defined Democrats - at all - that show him losing in any of the states we have tested."
The more recent survey conducted by the campaign involved extensive message-testing - in other words, asking questions about support for Trump only after first describing the Democrats in negative terms, according to two people familiar with the data. Such polling methods can be useful in assessing the strength of various messages but are not considered meaningful bottom-line measures of the current state of a campaign.
NBC on Sunday reported further data from the Trump campaign polls in March. The president trailed Biden by 1 point in Ohio, 6 points in Georgia, 7 points in Iowa, 8 points in North Carolina, 14 points in Minnesota, 15 points in Maine and 17 points in Virginia.

Texto completo: Iyanla Vanzant takes an 'Acts of Faith' remix on tour
Six-time New York Times bestselling author, spiritual life coach and executive producer Iyanla Vanzant has long delivered her message for spiritual growth and motivation to millions who have, or are, struggling with major life challenges and issues.
Self-help has always been at the heart of Vanzant's mission, from her debut book, "Acts of Faith: Daily Meditations for People of Color" (Simon & Schuster) to her popular Emmy award-winning series, "Iyanla: Fix My Life."
As the influential TV guru winds down production of her acclaimed show, Vanzant is going on the road for the Acts of Faith Remix Tour. This interactive and inspirational show features Vanzant along with a live music band in celebration of the 25th anniversary re-release of the "little purple book." The book has 365 daily prayers and reflections and has sold over 6,D00,000 copies worldwide.
"I wrote this incredible treatise for people and all they got to do is turn the page because everything is there," Vanzant explains. "Are you praying the prayer? Are you doing the breath work? Are you doing the journaling? I mean, you got to do the work. And that's where we get stuck. You have to have faith, you have to have zero tolerance policy, you have to have faith in you and your spiritual maintenance plan.
"The other thing is so many people live without a vision. Getting up every day, going to work and paying bills is not going to move you forward in your life, or in the world," she says. "Once you have a vision, you have to take time, you have to nurture the vision, and spend time in the vision, use your imagination, to move yourself forward. And then align your behavior, thinking and speaking with the vision."
The self-empowerment expert decades-long focus on faith has roots in the Delaware Valley, which was the starting point for her multimedia career and the launch pad for early her New York Times best-sellers. Vanzant's says she's ready to move on from her eponymous talk show, which is the No. 1 Unscripted drama on OWN, and share her spiritual teachings on another platform.
"I think one of the things about the TV show 'Fix My Life' is that it becomes a form of passive entertainment, but I want a more intimate relationship with people," Vanzant says. "I want to do more classes and more teaching, so that people can really, really maximize and benefit from everything that's available to us right now."
In a statement, Anne Ewers, president/CEO of the Kimmel Center for the Performing Art, said: "The Acts of Faith show will combine both serious conversations and laughter to tackle tough topics, in the same manner as Iyanla Vanzant's best-selling book. Her personal and professional journeys equip her to deliver an impactful - and unique - experience for Philadelphia audiences, who get to join Iyanla in celebrating her 25th anniversary."

Texto completo: Speaking to donors at the New York law firm where former Attorney General Loretta Lynch works, Joe Biden said he believed he was the Democrat who could defeat President Trump 2020.
The Tuesday morning event at the prestigious midtown Manhattan law firm was attended by about 100 donors and boasted a contribution level of $2,800, according to a pool report by a New York Times correspondent. The 76-year-old Biden told the crowd he had some thoughts on defeating Trump.
“I think I can be the guy that maybe can turn some of this around, we’ll see,” Biden said, according to the pool report. “I think, I think, I think that we have a clear chance of beating Donald Trump. And I think it's absolutely an obligation we have to our kids and our grandkids, to make sure he's not there four more years.”
Videoing of the event was not permitted. Biden, who suffered from a stutter as a child, has long had a habit of stumbling over his words and slurring his speech. He struggled with a number of words and phrases when he announced his presidential run.
At the fundraiser, Biden said the president engaged in politics that are “all about dividing us” in ways that are “dangerous — truly, truly dangerous.”
“The president not only goes after folks that are, don't look like him, but he goes after folks who in fact have, they're his allies,” Biden said. “Look what happens. Whether it's a Republican Congress or Democratic Congress, he attacks them. Why? To bring down those barriers that are all about the notion of abuse of power.”
Biden said: "If you want someone with a clenched fist and a hard heart...we already have one of those guys. I'm not that guy. I'm not that guy. I'm able to use my fist, I'm able to play brass knuckle politics in terms of what we have to do to get things done. But I'm not that guy and we can't be that country."
After the Tuesday morning fundraiser, Biden set off to a second law firm to solicit donations.

Texto completo: Varios inmigrantes indocumentados que fueron despedidos de los clubes de golf del presidente Donald Trump en Nueva Jersey y Nueva York le tienen una sorpresa nada agradable al mandatari durante su mitin en Florida, donde lanzará su campaña de reelección presidencia.
El abogado Aníbal Romero , quien representa a los inmigrantes, dijo que los inmigrantes harán una conferencia de prensa para defender la reforma migratoria el mismo día y en la misma ciudad en que el presidente Trump estará lanzando su campaña de reelección.
“Estos empleados que trabajan para Donald Trump representan a cientos de personas que han trabajado para él como inmigrantes indocumentados, y muestra cómo la Administración puede fácilmente vilipendiar y demonizar a los inmigrantes y, sin embargo, no tiene problemas para contratarlos”, expresó Romero.
Margarita Cruz y Adela García , examas de llaves en el Trump National Golf Club Westchester, así como Wiston Blandon, un ex lavaplatos en ese mismo club asistirán a la conferencia de prensa en Orlando.
Tamibén estarán presentes Sandra Díaz y Victorina Morales, examas de llaves en el club de Trump en Bedminster, Nueva Jersey.
El caso de estos inmigrantes conmocionó al país, al revelarse que el Organización Trump contrataba a extranjeros sin permisos de trabajo, mientras las políticas del presidente iban en sentido contrario.
La historia fue contada en diciembre de 2018 por Díaz y Morales a The New York Times , donde detallaron su experiencia en el club de Nueva Jersey.

Byron York: Three reasons Trump-Russia hasn't turned into Watergate

Texto completo: Why haven't efforts to impeach President Trump gained Watergate-style momentum? The lack of energy has created a sense of bafflement and disappointment among some of the president's most determined adversaries. But there are some simple reasons for it. Here are three:
1) The facts are different. In Watergate, the underlying crime was a break-in at Democratic National Committee headquarters, perpetrated by burglars paid by President Nixon's re-election campaign. The scandal proceeded from there. In Trump-Russia, the underlying crime was the hacking of the DNC's and John Podesta's emails -- a crime committed by Russians in Russia. Special counsel Robert Mueller, who indicted a number of Russians and Russian entities for their actions, spent two years trying to find conspiracy or coordination between the Russians and the Trump campaign. He failed.
That single fact has shaped every other aspect of the Trump-Russia affair. In Watergate, the cover-up flowed from Nixon's desire to conceal his campaign's involvement in the break-in and other political dark acts. It formed the bulk of the obstruction of justice case against Nixon, which in turn served as the basis for articles of impeachment. In Trump-Russia, Mueller did not charge, although he clearly suggested, that Trump obstructed the investigation of an event -- conspiracy/coordination -- that did not happen. That meant the simplest, most plausible motive for obstruction -- Trump, knowing he was guilty, tried to cover up his campaign's conspiracy with Russia -- was off the table. Given that, Mueller's obstruction case veered all over the map. He conceded that Trump had many motives to act as he did -- anger at being wrongly accused, concern over his ability to govern, a desire to defend the legitimacy of his election -- and that none of them involved covering up conspiracy or coordination with Russia.
That's a very different set of facts from Watergate. Consider the single most explosive episode of Watergate -- the Saturday Night Massacre, in which Nixon fired special prosecutor Archibald Cox. Trump's opponents say his desire to fire Mueller was Nixonesque. But try to imagine the Saturday Night Massacre with a Trumpian set of facts: What if Nixon told his White House counsel to tell the attorney general to fire Cox, but the counsel ignored the order? Nixon called again, and the counsel ignored him again. Nixon then let the matter drop, and Cox completed his investigation. No Saturday Night Massacre. That alone shows there is simply no comparison between Watergate and Trump-Russia.
2) The press is different. Just as the facts of Trump-Russia are quite unlike Watergate, so the media environment of 2019 is quite unlike what existed in 1974. Back then, there were three 30-minute broadcast network newscasts, CBS, NBC, and ABC. There were two big newspapers, the New York Times and the Washington Post, and TV network executives sat down each day, within a few blocks of each other in Manhattan, to produce newscasts that basically illustrated the papers' latest stories. There was no Internet, no cable news, no podcasts, no social media, and no talk radio. Nixon, even if he had had strong defenses, faced a solid wall of media opposition.
Today, the situation is much, much different -- and infinitely better. There is far more diversity of opinion in the media writ large, and, importantly, popular access to primary sources. That troubles some media figures who miss the old days of news monopoly. "During the Watergate era...there were three networks," Washington Post media columnist Margaret Sullivan wrote recently. "Now, cable news, talk radio, thousands of websites and social media create a polluted firehose-blast of information mixed with disinformation."
"Back then, what was said on those three networks...was largely believed," Sullivan added. "Much more than now, there was a shared set of facts."
But it was a limited set of facts -- just the ones selected by those network producers in Manhattan. Today's media diversity, in terms of the Trump-Russia affair, means more facts see the light. And people inclined to support the president, or just be skeptical of the government's investigative targeting of the Trump campaign, have a way to make their case beyond what anyone had forty-plus years ago.
3) Congress is different. Differences in the facts of the cases and differences in the media's ability to report those facts have had a profound effect on lawmakers. They're better informed, if they want to be, and can make a better defense of the president of their party. And having a significant number of constituents supporting the president makes representatives more likely to support him, too. (Also unlike today, in 1974 opposition party Democrats controlled all of Congress, with 243 seats in the House and 56 in the Senate.)
So this is a new world. It is perhaps not surprising to hear Democrats wish they could somehow turn today's Trump-Russia affair into yesterday's Watergate. If they could just hold televised hearings, they say, that could capture the nation's attention and give Trump-Russia a Watergate-like urgency. Americans would turn against the president by the millions.
Others believe they just need time. It took Watergate years to grow big enough to oust Nixon, they say. But look at the numbers. The break-in was in June, 1972, and Nixon resigned in August 1974 -- a period of two years and two months. In Trump-Russia, the FBI began its investigation nearly three years ago, in July 2016. The Senate began investigating in January 2017. And Mueller took office in May 2017. It's been a long time.
Trump-Russia could go longer still, and it would not change the basic facts of the case. It is simply a different case in a different world. Try as they might, the president's opponents can't make it 1974 again.

Texto completo: El presidente Donald Trump respondió a sus bajos números en las encuestas despidiendo a tres de los cinco esncuestadores de su campaña luego que se filtaron a la prensa las preocupantes cifras del apoyo electoral del magante en estados claves para su reelección en 2020.
La medida se produce después de que la semana pasada, varios medios de comunicación informaran sobre la existencia de una encuesta de 17 estados, que supuso muy malas noticias para la reelección de Trump.
El sondeo, realizado por Tony Fabrizio, encuestador líder de la campaña de Trump, entre el 13 de marzo y el 28 de marzo, encontró a Trump detrás del ex vicepresidente Joe Biden con dos dígitos en todos los estados que se consideran cruciales para su victoria en 2020.
Esa misma encuesta que se filtró a la prensa también mostró a Trump con un desempeño inferior en los estados republicanos confiables que no han sido competitivos durante décadas en las elecciones presidenciales.
La decisión de la campaña de despiddir a sus propios encuestadores , Michael Baselice, Adam Geller y Brett Lloyd, tiene el propósito de evitar nuevas fugas de datos de encuestas internas, informó el New York Times el domingo.
Trump ha negado airadamente la cobertura de los números en los últimos días, y dijo a ABC News en una entrevista transmitida el jueves: “Esas encuestas no existen. Acabo de reunirme con alguien que es un encuestador y estoy ganando en todas partes, así que simplemente No sé de qué estás hablando “.
Trump también tuiteó que sus números son “los mejores números que hemos tenido”, y afirmó que los números informados eran de “Encuestas falsas”.

Texto completo: Rabbis went to St. Augustine amid civil-rights strife

Editor's note: The St. Augustine Jewish Historical Society will dedicate a bronze marker in honor of the 16 rabbis arrested during civil-rights demonstrations in St. Augustine 55 years ago. The dedication and a reception are at 10:30 a.m. Tuesday on the site of the arrest, now the Hilton Garden Inn Bayfront, 32 Avenida Menendez. Below is a 2014 Times-Union story on the rabbis' experiences, slightly edited.

The annual conference of reform rabbis barely had begun in Atlantic City, N.J., when the presiding rabbi stepped forward with an urgent telegram.

It came from Martin Luther King Jr., down in St. Augustine. He needed help. He needed rabbis to take part in demonstrations against the segregated city.

He needed them immediately.

King's plea moved Jerrold Goldstein: "That was a call, a clarion call for help, to do something in the fight for desegregation," he said.

On that day, in June 1964, Goldstein was a 28-year-old assistant rabbi at a venerable temple in St. Paul, Minn. He'd been eager to go to the conference, his first. He'd barely unpacked.

But the next morning he was at the airport in

Philadelphia, a ticket in his hand. With him were 15 other rabbis and a Jewish social-justice organizer.

Goldstein had cleared his change of plans with his boss, the senior rabbi. But he delayed telling his wife, Frances, home with their infant daughter, until he got to the airport in Jacksonville.

She would worry, he knew. But by then, it was too late to turn back.

King's telegram told the rabbis to expect to be arrested. So Goldstein was ready for that, ready to take a stand as a faith leader for something he saw so clearly as the right thing to do.

But 50 years later, Goldstein says that in many ways he had been naive. He was a Los Angeles native, a white middle-class man who'd never felt threatened, who'd always respected authority and been respected back.

"Nothing in my life prepared me for the danger zone into which I was moving," he said.

Rabbi Allen Secher, though, was prepared for anything. Or so he thought. A couple of years earlier, he had spent a week in an Albany, Ga., jail after a civil-rights protest there. Thirty-two men in a cell meant for four. Excrement from the overflowing toilet soaking their feet. Jeering crowds outside their cell.

Anti-Semites tormented Secher as he grew up in western Pennsylvania, so he had no tolerance for seeing other people persecuted. That made the decision to join King in St. Augustine an easy one.

"I knew what I was getting into," Secher said.

On June 17, 1964, once on the ground in Jacksonville, the rabbis took cars to St. Augustine and went directly to a black church, where activists gathered to sing, pray and organize before marching to the city's old slave market.

King greeted them at the back door.

"Then I got the best introduction of my life," Goldstein said. "It was welcoming. It was strong. He said, ‘Here come Moses' people,' and they all cheered, like I'd just walked across the desert. They were so happy to us; I know they felt so isolated, so endangered."

King told them what would happen next: They would march to the old slave market. People would taunt them, threaten them. Don't answer them; just keep your eyes straight ahead.

And stand tall, he told them: We are demonstrating our dignity, no matter what they say or do.

Just outside the church, the segregationist crowd was lying in wait. Some had broken bottles in their hands. Others had bricks. Red-faced and spitting, they screamed obscenities and racial slurs; the Jews who joined the march on this night provided new, poisonous opportunities for their insults.

Secher, who was 29, a rabbi based in Mexico City, said he never had been more scared. There had been reports of a sniper in a tree the night before, he said, and he could not block that from his mind.

He found himself near the front of the procession, holding hands with a young black woman. Her courage astounded him; she must have faced this many times before, but she never faltered.

Goldstein was terrified, too. More than that, he was sickened by what he saw.

"I don't want to compare it to the Holocaust. That's too cheap a deal. But I saw the existence of a real capacity for hate, for vicious hate, in human beings."

Though the vitriol aimed at them was immense, there was no violence that night; law officers were scattered along the route, which kept the mob in check.

At the slave market, the demonstrators sang songs: "We Shall Overcome" and some Christian songs Goldstein didn't really know. The march back to the church was quieter, and the rabbis split up to spend the night in the homes of some of the black activists.

The next day, the rabbis went out to get arrested, accompanying black activists to two restaurants and the swimming pool at the Monson Motor Lodge.

And so some became witnesses to one of the iconic images of St. Augustine's civil rights struggles: Monson hotel manager James Brock pouring muriatic acid into the pool where black and white demonstrators swam.

Secher saw the whole thing, and was impressed that the demonstrators stood their ground as it happened. "It was the most courageous thing I've ever seen," he said. "These kids just didn't move."

Neither he nor Goldstein made it out of the parking lot, though, before they were arrested.

Police, armed with cattle prods, segregated the black and white demonstrators, some of whom resisted. "I wasn't so brave as to resist the arrest," Goldstein said.

A New York Times correspondent on the scene tallied up the score: "The 16 rabbis, the swimmers, the two leaders of the march and nine other demonstrators were taken to jail to join the more than 200 persons arrested earlier in sit-ins."

Secher said that after he was arrested, a law officer made him and other protesters pose for a photo. "I guess for his scrapbook," he said. Another officer, he said, poked an electric cattle prod at the bottom of a young white woman who'd been arrested, shoving it through her skirt. "She screamed. Screamed!" he said. "Like a teenage horror movie, a terror-filled scream."

Goldstein said the leader of a local synagogue visited the rabbis in jail. He did not come to offer support. Instead, he lectured them about how they had no business coming to St. Augustine, how people were getting along just fine until a few outside demonstrators stirred up trouble.

The visiting rabbis were not dissuaded -- not by those words or the conditions of the cell in which the 17 in their group were confined. It was sweltering, overcrowded. There were two bunks, and the men pulled the mattresses to the floor and took turns at fitful sleep.

By the light of a bare bulb in the corridor, they composed a letter they called "Why We Went."

They went, they wrote, "because we could not stay away." Because King asked them. Because here was a chance to act when too often they had been silent, "at a time when silence has become the unpardonable sin of our time ..."

"We came as Jews who remember the millions of faceless people who stood quietly, watching the smoke rise from Hitler's crematoria. We came because we know that, second only to silence, the greatest danger to man is loss of faith in man's capacity to act."

The middle of the next day, they were released, and headed their separate ways. Goldstein didn't go back to the rabbis' conference. He went home, to his wife and family, where people hailed him for his role in the demonstrations, and helped raise his $900 in bail. It was nice to be lauded, not insulted, but he didn't feel like a hero. He remembered, mostly, being scared-- and impressed by those who stood for change back in St. Augustine. "If anybody was brave, they were brave," he said.

Secher said, though, that the rabbis might have helped push the country a little bit toward change. That's what people tell him, anyway. "Did we really do good? I put a question mark after that. I think it took a while. We're told this played a role in the Civil Rights Act of ‘64. If it did, boy, am I proud of that one."

Texto completo: ASPEN, Colorado — Aperol spritzes are most definitely back on the menu, because if Martha Stewart says it, it must be so.
Speaking to hundreds of eager fans who paid nearly $2,000 per ticket at the world's fanciest food festival this weekend, Stewart shared her favorite Aperol spritz recipe and took issue with a May 9 New York Times article calling it "not a good drink. "
Said Stewart, in a way that declared the matter closed: “I like it. ” The audience erupted into applause as she took another sip of the sparkling orange cocktail that's a favorite of Instagrammers everywhere.
In between shout-outs for her ice-ball maker, her wine club and her most recent cookbook, Stewart headlined a sprawling cast of celebrity chefs, winemakers, distillers and celebrities who descended on this picturesque mountain town for the annual Food & Wine Classic.
After telling a series of stories that had the audience roaring with laughter, and accidentally advising guests to use a Cuisinart food processor instead of event-sponsor KitchenAid, Stewart wondered aloud if her first festival would be her last: "I hope they invite me back," she said with a smile.
Other high-profile guests included "Top Chef" Season 16 hosts and contestants, including winner Kelsey Barnard Clark of the restaurant Eat KBC in Dothan, Alabama; and chefs from Ming Tsai to Rick Bayless to Andrew Zimmern.
Instagram-famous people were everywhere, eating sustainable seafood lunches with Zimmern, posing with a keg-size bottle of wine or sweating off their excesses with yoga classes. Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom were spotted several times, and invites to late-night parties with unlimited drinks and food were the currency of the weekend.
Capping off the extravagance was wine educator and author Mark Oldman, who hosted a pair of tastings in which participants each tried the equivalent of $14,000 in wine, had they bought the bottles themselves. Dubbed "Wines for Quadrillionaires," Oldman drew inspiration from wines served aboard the Concorde and showed up in a custom-made pilot's uniform, holding court with a champagne saber.
And while guests at Oldman's tasting tried a variety of once-in-a-lifetime wines, it was his 300-glass bottle of Stag's Leap Wine Cellars 2014 CASK 23 cabernet sauvignon (worth $13,000) that stole the show – and had guests posing for photos.
The Heritage Fire festival, also held annually the same weekend in nearby Snowmass, had chefs grilling meats, fish and veggies over open flames. The festival is separate from the Aspen events but draws many of the same guests.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — The Trump campaign has fired some of its pollsters following reports that its internal reelection polls showed President Donald Trump losing to former Vice President Joe Biden in a hypothetical matchup in battleground states.
NBC News first reported Sunday morning that the Trump campaign would be ending its relationships with some pollsters following the leaks, which had first been reported on earlier last week. The New York Times and ABC News later confirmed the departures, adding that two pollsters would be staying on — Tony Fabrizio and John McLaughlin.
According to the polling numbers obtained by NBC, Trump was trailing Biden by double digits in the key swing states of Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Florida, and Michigan. The poll was conducted from March 13-28.
USA TODAY/Suffolk Poll: Most Americans want Trump to comply with House subpoenas. But impeach him? Not so fast

Trump also trailed Biden in Iowa, North Carolina, Virginia, Ohio, Georgia, Minnesota, and Maine.
Trump led Biden by only two points in Texas, where a Democrat has not won since Jimmy Carter took the state in 1976.
Trump campaign staff did not dispute the authenticity of the polls. Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale told NBC that the polls were out of date.
“These leaked numbers are ancient," he argued, "in campaign terms, from months-old polling that began in March before two major events had occurred: the release of the summary of the Mueller report exonerating the President, and the beginning of the Democrat candidates defining themselves with their far-left policy message. "
In a press conference following his meeting with the president of Poland last Wednesday, Trump himself addressed the initial leak of some of the poll data, calling them "fake" and "ridiculous.
"We have great internal polling. They were fake polls that were released by somebody that is — it's ridiculous," he said.

Voters, your foreign policy views stink

Texto completo: Most of human history has been marked by war. Between 1500 and 1945, scarcely a year went by without some great power fighting another great power. Then, in 1945, that stopped. The number of battlefield deaths has plummeted to the lowest levels in history. The world has experienced the greatest reduction in poverty in history, as well as the greatest spread of democracy and freedom.
Why did this happen? Mostly it was because the United States decided to lead a community of nations to create a democratic world order. That order consisted of institutions like NATO, the U.N. and the World Bank. But it was also enforced by the pervasive presence of American power  military, economic and cultural power as well as the magnetic power of the democratic idea, which inspired dissidents worldwide.
Building any community requires exercising power. America's leaders made some terrible mistakes (Vietnam, Iraq). The nation never got to enjoy the self-righteous sense of innocence that the powerless and reclusive enjoy.
But the U.S. having been dragged into two world wars, leaders from Truman to Obama felt they had no choice but to widen America's circle of concern across the whole world. This was abnormal. As Robert Kagan writes in "The Jungle Grows Back," "Very few nations in history have ever felt any responsibility for anything but themselves."
Overall, this history should be a source of pride for all Americans, but it is not. Researchers from the Center for American Progress recently completed a survey of American foreign policy views. They write: "When asked what the phrase maintaining the liberal international order' indicated to them, all but one of the participants in our focus groups drew a blank. Voters across educational lines simply did not understand what any of these phrases ... meant or implied."
That by itself is not a problem. The liberal order was built by foreign policy elites, from George Marshall to Madeleine Albright. The problem is that voters are now actively hostile to the project. Instead of widening the circle of concern, most Americans want the U.S. to simply look after itself.
The CAP researchers asked 2,000 registered voters what U.S. foreign policy priorities should be. The top priorities were protecting against terrorist threats, protecting jobs for American workers and reducing illegal immigration. These are all negative aspirations: preventing bad things from hostile outsiders.
The lowest priorities were promoting democracy, taking on Chinese aggression, promoting trade, fighting global poverty and defending human rights. The things Americans care least about are the core activities of building a civilized global community.
After Iraq and other debacles, many Americans are exhausted by the global leadership role. Many have lost faith in the nation's leadership class. They say correctly that we have a lot of problems here at home.
But a big part of the shift is caused by the fact that many Americans have lost faith in human nature and human possibility.
Even after the horrors of World War II, most Americans said that people can be trusted. Building a community of nations seemed like a doable proposition because most people are basically good. Even today, people who express high social trust are much more likely to see America as an indispensable nation, much more likely to believe American values are universal values and much more likely to support the policies that preserve the liberal world order.
But social trust has collapsed over the decades, especially among the young. Distrustful, alienated people don't want to get involved in the strange, hostile, outside world.
There are two types of low-trust voters. On the right there are the Trumpian America Firsters, who want to cut immigration and break alliances. On the left there are the New Doves. These are young people who express high interest in human rights, but having grown up in the Iraq era, they don't want the U.S. to get involved in protecting them. A survey of American voters by the Eurasia Group Foundation reported, "People under 30 years old were the most likely to want the United States to abstain from intervening in human rights abuses."
The America Firsters and the New Doves may think of themselves as opposites, but they wind up in the same place: America should not be abroad preserving the liberal world order.
The CAP study estimates that less than a fifth of voters are traditional internationalists. The Eurasia Group study estimates that only 9.5% are.
America is withdrawing from the world; the results are there for all to see. China is cracking down on democratic rights in Hong Kong. Russia launches cyberattacks everywhere. Iran is destabilizing the Middle East. The era of great power rivalry is coming back.
We're in a dark spiral. Americans take a dark view of human nature and withdraw from the world. Wolves like Putin and Xi fill the void and make bad things happen, confirming the dark view and causing even more withdrawal.
We need a leader who can grapple with failures like Iraq, build a younger, credible leadership class and embody an optimism that pulls us out of the dark spiral.
David Brooks writes a syndicated column for the New York Times.

A primary &#xa0;of substance

Texto completo: Although their voting patterns often don’t reflect it, Americans claim to prefer substance over style in their presidential candidates. That claim is being tested to an unusual degree by U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts as the race for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination takes shape.
By our count, Warren has issued 19 detailed and ambitious policy proposals since the beginning of the year, covering everything from taxes to housing to student debt to public lands to breaking up the giants of the tech industry. Her “I have a plan for that” slogan seems to be resonating with some voters, and her poll numbers are rising accordingly. She is also putting pressure on her 22 rivals for the nomination to follow her example, which should help all voters to make informed choices.
Warren not only has plans; she has big plans. Taken together, they would bring about major structural change to an economy that many Americans have concluded no longer works for them. She proposes such things as student debt cancellation; eliminating tuition at public colleges; a system of universal, affordable child care; and making big federal investments in housing. As to the inevitable question, “How are you going to pay for it?” — well, she also has a plan for that: Big tax increases on the wealthiest individuals and corporations, including a new tax on corporate profits and a new “wealth tax” on household assets in excess of $50 million. She calculates those measures would raise $3.8 trillion over 10 years.
Reasonable people can, and will, disagree about the merits of any of the individual proposals. But there is great value in focusing more broadly on how to make the economy function better. As Robert Reich, who served as secretary of labor in the Clinton administration, told The New York Times, “She is asking the biggest questions that exist: How do you make the free market work? How do you make capitalism actually work for the many rather than the few?”
And speaking of Bill Clinton, his famous declaration that “the era of big government is over” appears to have been premature. New York magazine reported recently on political scientist James Stimson’s most recent “Public Policy Mood estimate,” which measures shifts in ideological opinion over time. He concluded that the American public was more favorably disposed to liberal economic policy in 2018 than at any other time in the past 68 years. If that’s true, Warren’s proposals may find a receptive audience.
As to charisma on the campaign trail, Warren comes up short in the eyes of many observers. But, writes Dahlia Lithwick, senior editor at Slate.com, she shines during question-and-answer time, both because of her technical grasp of complex matters and because of her ability to explain them clearly.
This rings true from reading some of her position papers. Take, for instance, this passage from the wealth tax proposal: “While we must make income taxes more progressive, that alone won’t straighten out our slanted tax code or our lopsided economy. Consider two people: an heir with $500 million in yachts, jewelry and fine art, and a teacher with no savings in the bank. If both the heir and the teacher bring home $50,000 in labor income next year, they would pay the same amount in federal taxes, despite their vastly different circumstances. Increasing income taxes won’t address this problem. That’s why we need a tax on wealth.”
Do not take any of the above as an endorsement of Warren’s candidacy or any of her individual proposals, or even as a statement of preference among the contenders. There’s plenty of time to sort all that out. What we do endorse heartily is a presidential primary campaign that takes substance seriously and can serve to educate voters as to how the country ended up in its current mess and how it might get out of it. To her credit, Warren has set the stage for that.

Texto completo: This simple wisdom — “Fans don’t boo nobodies” — is courtesy the pinstriped philosopher Reggie Jackson, and it resonates for anyone who has ever been in the public sphere.
Put yourself out there and the cranks crank it up. In the end, they’re still cranks.
When you are being noticed, it’s because you have become a cause for concern, for somebody.
So that’s how I realized early this month that the formerly minor character known as Mayor Pete has become a serious cause for concern for the Republican National Committee as it continues its unethical quest to re-elect the president.
How did I realize this? Because the RNC told me so.
On June 3, its Christiana Purves sent me an email: “Good evening — With less than a month to go before the first 2020 Democrat Presidential debate, we’re still only scratching the surface of truly learning about lesser-vetted candidates like Pete Buttigieg. Unfortunately for Mayor Pete, the more we learn, Californians are more likely to see that he was a lousy Mayor who’s struggling to keep up with the pace of presidential politics.”
Then Purves goes on to cite an odd selection of stories from what the Grand Old Party on a normal day, when it didn’t suit its needs, would term the lamestream media.
“‘I ain’t ever seen the dude’ — Residents of South Bend’s poor neighborhoods say Democratic presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg left them behind,” the RNC quotes CNBC as saying. Oh, how the GOP is in touch with America’s troubled urban youth. And then: “Buttigieg is only top 2020 presidential candidate not offering staffers health care yet.” Ha ha ha. The former deputy press secretary for Trump buddy Sen. Lindsey Graham concerned a Democratic longshot is not yet being able to afford benefits for his ragtag staff? Ha ha ha.
But with the RNC concerned enough about the guy to start doing a lot of opposition research and sending it out to members of the press, maybe he’s not such a longshot, what?
I have by no means figured out who stands the best chance of preventing the global disaster that would be a second term for this president. No one has stood out in particular from the clearly too many candidates clogging the opposition field. Too bad a gutsy moderate Republican won’t come forward to take advantage of the ridiculously tainted incumbent.
The latest poll of California Democratic voters goes: Biden 22, Sanders 17, Harris 13, Warren 18, Buttigieg 10, O’Rourke 3.
So, only 10 percent of California’s Democratic voters right now say Buttigieg is their main man. Or, to look at it another way, a guy who otherwise just leads the fourth-largest city in Indiana is in fifth place among voters in the nation’s largest state. And this sudden GOP attention would lead us to believe that’s fifth place with a bullet. Harvard and Oxford graduate, former Navy Reserve lieutenant who served in Afghanistan — nice resume. Oh, and he’s gay. And he’s getting noticed — pollsters say awareness of Buttigieg shot up from 4% to 48% in the last six months.
Still actually a stretch, though. The problematical guy who is for some reason not a longshot, Joe Biden, is the frontrunner who is really giving the incumbent conniption fits. The president’s own campaign pollster came to him with numbers from a 17-state survey showing Trump losing to Biden in states that he needs to win, including Texas (sweet!), Michigan and Pennsylvania. After seeing the polls, the president told aides to deny them, Annie Karmin reports in The New York Times.
Biden is “Sleepy Joe” to Trump.
What’s he gonna call Buttigieg when the going gets rough on down the road?

LET THEM EAT GOLD CUPCAKES HALF THE WORLD'S CHILDREN ARE MALNOURISHED IN OUR DECADENT AGE

Texto completo: ANTIGUA, Guatemala
Raúl is a happy preschooler, tumbling around among 4- and 5-year-olds, but something is off.
It's not his behavior, for it's the same as that of the other little kids. Rather, it's his face. The baby fat is gone, and although he's only 3 feet 5 inches tall, the height of an average 5-year-old, an older face seems grafted on.
Sure enough, Raúl turns out to be 9. Malnutrition has left his body and mind badly stunted. He's one of almost one-quarter of all children worldwide who are stunted from malnutrition.
Here in Guatemala, almost half of children are stunted. In some Mayan villages, it's 70%.
*
In another world, on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, the restaurant Serendipity 3 offers a $295 hamburger. Alternatively, it sells a $214 grilled cheese sandwich and a $1,000 sundae.
.
br data-css-regions-fragment-of="27286">
"Stunting is probably the best marker of child health inequality," Kirsten Austad, a physician with the Maya Health Alliance, told me. "Stunting is a key driver of intergenerational poverty."
The big problem with stunting from malnutrition isn't that people are short but that they often have impaired brain development.
"He's like a 5-year-old," Rina Lazo Rodríguez, director of the Casa Jackson Hospital for Malnourished Children, said of Raúl. He is now living at the hospital and has never attended school, and staff members aren't sure to what extent he can recover physically or mentally.
Studies find that malnourished children do less well in school, and the mental impairment is visible in brain scans.
The implication is that billions of I.Q. points are lost to malnutrition, and that the world's greatest unexploited resource is not oil or gold but the minds of hungry children.
*
For the diner who has everything, restaurants offer gold in food. A Dubai restaurant, for example, has sold a cupcake enveloped in gold leaf. The gold is tasteless (and nontoxic), so its only purpose is extravagant novelty and a glittering price - in this case, more than $1,000 per cupcake.
*
I'm on my annual win-a-trip journey, in which I take a university student with me on a reporting trip. This year the winner is Mia Armstrong of Arizona State University, and we've been dropping in on villagers in rural Guatemala - and seeing stunning levels of malnutrition. The problem isn't just shortage of calories but of vital micronutrients such as zinc, iron, iodine and vitamin A.
Alas, the most boring word in the English language may be "micronutrients." And boring causes don't get addressed or funding.
One girl we met, Ingrid, was 14 years old and 4 feet 7 inches tall. I asked her if she was in school.
"I dropped out in the first grade," she said.
I asked her to write her name in my notebook.
"I can't write my name," she responded.
*
Sotheby's last year auctioned off a bottle of wine, a Romanee Conti 1945 Domaine de la Romanée-Conti. The label was stained and there were signs of seepage, but the single bottle sold for $558,000.
*
Shawn Baker of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation refers to "the 45% - 1% disconnect." As he explained: "Malnutrition is the underlying cause of 45% of deaths in children under 5, yet less than 1 percent of global foreign assistance goes to addressing undernutrition.
"The bulk of the damage is done in the first 1,000 days - from conception through two years of life - and that damage is largely irreversible." Aside from cognitive impairment, stunted children grow up to have more health problems in adulthood, and stunted women deliver smaller babies, sometimes perpetuating the cycle of poverty.
*
The Ranch in Malibu, Calif., offers a luxury nine-night weight-loss program for $11,400 per person.
*
Nutrition programs are extremely cheap, often among the most cost-effective ways to fight global poverty.
School feeding programs promote education as well as nutrition, and cost just 25 cents per child per meal. Deworming costs about 50 cents per child per year to improve both nutrition and health, yet pets in the United States are more likely to be dewormed than children in many other places.
As Mia noted in a separate article, one nutrition initiative could save up to 800,000 lives a year and requires no electricity, refrigeration or high technology. It's simply support for breast-feeding.
Fortifying foods with iron, zinc, iodine and vitamin A is transformative. Ensuring that children are screened for malnutrition and promptly helped with supplements that are similar to peanut butter is fairly straightforward. Yet malnourished children aren't a priority, so kids are stunted in ways that will hold back our world for many decades to come.
If some distant planet sends foreign correspondents to Earth, they will be baffled that we allow almost one child in four to be stunted, even as we indulge in gold leaf cupcakes, $1,000 sundaes and half-million-dollar bottles of wine.
*
"In 2018, an estimated 60 percent of cats and 56 percent of dogs in the United States were overweight or obese. Pet obesity remains a serious health threat."

Something is wrong with this picture.

U.S. Forces Turn to Containment as ISIS Tightens Grip in Eastern Afghanistan

Texto completo: DEH BALA, Afghanistan -- Two years ago, Pentagon officials said that American forces in the remote reaches of Afghanistan could defeat the Islamic State's offshoot here by the end of 2017.
This month, American Special Forces in eastern Afghanistan were still fighting, with no end in sight.
During a visit by a New York Times reporter to their dusty army outpost, in the eastern province of Nangarhar, the Americans pointed out the ridges and valleys at the foot of the snow-capped Spin Ghar mountains: There, they noted, was the start of the Islamic State's territory, in some of the most forbidding terrain in Afghanistan.
The extremist group is growing, able to out-recruit its casualties so far, according to military officials. It is well funded by illicit smuggling and other revenue streams. And in the eastern part of the country, Islamic State fighters are waging a war of terrain that the United States military can -- for now -- only contain, those officials said.
Interviews with six current and former American officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, indicated that the group is poised to expand its influence if the United States and the Taliban reach a peace settlement. The officials expressed concern that in addition to destabilizing the Afghan government, the group is becoming connected to terrorist plots beyond Afghanistan's borders.
Deep in Afghanistan, the immediate conclusion has been to try to keep up the pressure through patrols and raids by American and Afghan Special Operations units. But the officials acknowledge that it all amounts to more of a containment effort than anything that could eradicate the Islamic State loyalists here.
[Read about the journey that this reporter, Thomas Gibbons-Neff, took when he went from marine infantryman to journalist.]
Mission Support Site Jones, on the outskirts of the small village of Deh Bala, is part of the small constellation of Special Forces outposts in Nangarhar.
The Special Forces units are falling back on a counterinsurgency strategy that has been used off and on throughout 18 years of war. That means they are juggling between clearing territory alongside Afghan troops, trying to hold it, and building an Afghan force that could take over security for the district -- supposedly while keeping the Islamic State contained -- when the Americans eventually leave.
During a recent meeting at his outpost in Nangarhar Province, the team leader of a Special Forces unit pointed to a map of Deh Bala spread out in front of him.
"They're always going to hold those mountains," he said of the Islamic State. The team leader spoke on the condition of anonymity because the Pentagon insists that members of Special Operations units not disclose their names.
History supports his view: This corner of eastern Afghanistan has sheltered insurgencies for hundreds of years.
Efforts to root out militants in this area are hampered by shifting weather that can quickly close off air support, and by drastic changes in elevation -- by thousands of feet -- that limit the troops and equipment that can be safely ferried by helicopter.
What began in 2015 as a small group of tribes composed mostly of former Pakistani Taliban fighters who pledged allegiance to the Islamic State and its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, soon grew into a loosely connected web of fighters and commanders spread throughout the country.
According to American military officials, fighters gradually appeared from all over the region, including Kazakhstan and Tajikistan, as well as a trickle of fighters who had fought in Iraq and Syria.
In the Afghan offshoot's early months, Islamic State leadership in the Middle East sent money to help it along. But officials say the group has approached self-sufficiency by extorting money from locals along with smuggling timber, drugs and raw earth material, such as lapis lazuli, mined in some of the eastern provinces.
Islamic State fighters in Afghanistan are paid significantly more per month than their Taliban counterparts, in some regions by hundreds of dollars. And they have been able to keep growing.
There are an estimated 3,000 Islamic State fighters in Afghanistan, but their relatively low numbers belie the group's growing support network of facilitators with unclear alliances and its ability to move with relative ease between Afghanistan and Pakistan, according to the officials. In recent months, Islamic State cells have appeared in the northern province of Kunduz and the western province of Herat.
But no Islamic State cell is more threatening to maintaining stability in Afghanistan than the one in Kabul, the Afghan capital.
The Islamic State groups there have become increasingly skilled in avoiding detection, the officials said, staging high-profile attacks more frequently since 2016. Last year, it carried out an estimated 24 attacks in Kabul, leaving hundreds dead or wounded and outpacing the Taliban's Haqqani network as the most lethal group in the capital, officials said.
In Kabul and other major cities, Islamic State recruiters are siphoning disenfranchised and educated youth from universities, American officials said. And though the group has long been considered to be locally focused, there is growing concern that it is turning its sights to attacks abroad.
American officials now say that at least one Islamic State leader in Nangarhar Province helped inspire and direct the April 7, 2017, terrorist attack in Stockholm that left five people dead and at least 12 wounded when Rakhmat Akilov, an Uzbek citizen, drove a hijacked beer truck into a crowd of people. One senior intelligence official said that eight people had been arrested in the United States on accusations of providing support to the Islamic State offshoot in Afghanistan.
The group's growing profile, particularly within Kabul, led Gen. Austin S. Miller to form a Special Operations task force soon after he took command of the American-led mission in Afghanistan last year. The task force, led by American troops, works alongside Afghan police special units to track and target Islamic State members.
The task force, according to one American defense official, could be the foundation for a counterterrorism force left behind after any peace agreement with the Taliban is reached.
But that idea remains a sticking point in the continuing peace talks in Qatar. American military officials say the Taliban have pushed back on that proposal, insisting that their fighters could handle and defeat the Islamic State loyalists.
[Sign up for the weekly At War newsletter to receive stories about duty, conflict and consequence.]
Recently, though, the Taliban has done little to fight the Islamic State. American officials give the example of Kunar Province, where the extremist group has quietly probed into Taliban-held territory for months and where Taliban counterattacks have gained little traction. Taliban fighters there, for the most part, have continued to focus on attacking Afghan government forces rather than the competing militants, the officials said.
But not only are the Taliban mostly avoiding fighting the Islamic State, they are also feeding its ranks. Taliban insurgents serve as one of the Islamic State's primary recruiting pools, and they often bring a wealth of combat experience with them, according to the officials.
This has made American military leadership increasingly concerned about large groups of Taliban fighters shifting to the Islamic State if a peace deal is reached. Already, the Islamic State in Afghanistan is using propaganda in preparation for a concerted recruiting campaign after any settlement.
But despite the political uncertainty, the unsettled future of American forces in Afghanistan and the potential surge in Islamic State fighters there, the slow war in Deh Bala goes on.
The Special Forces team at Mission Support Site Jones, named after Capt. Jason Benjamin Jones, a Green Beret who was killed in Nangarhar Province in 2014, is building up its outpost, now a year old. The team has a weekly meeting with village elders, where they discuss the district's security and the results of recent American and Afghan operations.
In a few months, the Special Forces team here will return to the United States only to be replaced by another detachment. But its remaining time will be spent the same way: juggling community outreach and training efforts with hazardous raids up into the mountains where the Islamic State shelters, in the hope that the group can somehow be contained.

The Democratic debate stage lineup is out. Here's how it could all play out

Texto completo: It's official: We now know which candidates will be facing off during the first Democratic National Committee debate June 26 and 27 in Miami.
The first night will feature Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, Beto O'Rourke, Amy Klobuchar, John Delaney, Tulsi Gabbard, Julian Castro, Tim Ryan, Bill de Blasio, and Jay Inslee.
The second group, which will debate the following night, will feature Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, Bernie Sanders, Kirsten Gillibrand, Michael Bennet, Marianne Williamson, Eric Swalwell, Andrew Yang, and John Hickenlooper.
Here are four takeaways from the announced lineups:
It sure looks like there's a tiered debate structure The front-runners of the crowded 2020 primary field are featured heavily on the second night, with Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders, and Pete Buttigieg among the slate of 10. For example, all polled above 7 percent in a recent Quinnipiac poll of 500 likely voters.
As for the first night, Warren had 15 percent of support in the Quinnipiac poll, but none of the candidates she is set to debate received more than 3 percent of support. The lineup could be an opportunity for Warren to stand out.
The Democratic National Committee said that it would not create an “undercard" debate, as was done during the 2016 Republican primaries, and said it would try to spread the front-runners across both nights using a set of two random draws, one for candidates polling at above 2 percent and one for the rest of the field. The idea was to avoid charges of favoritism that dogged the DNC throughout the 2016 presidential primary campaign. But with NBC's decision to hold the Biden/Sanders/Harris/Buttigieg group's debate Thursday night — reportedly to “maximize viewership" — there appears to be a tiered structure despite the DNC's efforts.
No Biden/Warren rematch . . . With Biden and Warren appearing on separate stages, we won't get a replay of Warren's 2005 face-off with the then-senator during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on changes to personal bankruptcy law.
Warren, then a Harvard Law professor, appeared at the hearing to fight a proposed bill that would make it harder for individuals to file for bankruptcy, thereby discharging their debt.
Biden, who voted in favor of the bill, challenged Warren's criticism that credit card companies were getting their loans repaid before driving people into bankruptcy with interest and fees, which Biden said was merely a complaint about predatory credit practices, not a flaw in the bill.
“But, senator, if you're not going to fix that problem, you can't take away the last shred of protection for these families," Warren said, referring to bankruptcy.
“I got it, OK, you're very good, professor," Biden said.
It's clear Warren is ready to revive the issue. She criticized Biden as being “on the side of credit card companies" shortly after he got into the race.
. . . but there are plenty of others eager to attack Biden Biden will stand on stage alongside a formidable group — with some running well to his left and all surely eager to knock him down a few points in the polls. In particular, Sanders has been critical of Biden's stances on health care and trade policy.
And the 37-year-old Buttigieg has tried to make age an issue in the election, though he's refrained from explicitly referencing Biden. He's taken veiled jabs at Biden's recent statement that Republicans will experience an “epiphany" if Trump is out of the presidency.
“Democrats can no more keep a promise to take us back to the 2000s or the 1990s than conservatives can keep a promise to take us back to the 1950s. We can only look forward," Buttigieg has said.
Biden could find that he spends the precious few speaking minutes he gets defending himself from the much of the field.
The debates, as always, are an opportunity for lesser-known candidates to make inroads Candidates who have not gained much traction have an opportunity to make their case before an audience of politically engaged Democratic voters. For some, there's nowhere to go but up: Gillibrand, Hickenlooper, Gabbard, Delaney, Inslee, Bennet, de Blasio, Williamson, and Swalwell all polled at zero percent in the recent Qunnipiac poll.
In beginning of the presidential primary season in August 2015, 24 million viewers tuned in to a Fox News debate of Republican candidates. If the Democratic debates approach that kind of viewership, it's a real opportunity for those candidates who are not household names to introduce themselves to Americans.
Then again, 10 candidates will need to share two hours of speaking time. Representative Seth Moulton, who did not qualify for the debate stage, has said he thinks that kind of speaking time math would negate any advantage gained by participating.
“Folks are barely going to get a chance to speak," the Salem Democrat told Hugh Hewitt, a nationally syndicated radio show host. “This is a long campaign. And it's not going to be decided by the Democratic National Committee in their debates."

Texto completo: In an NBC interview that aired today, Anita Hill implied she would support Joe Biden for president should he become the eventual Democratic nominee. Hill has previously been outspoken about her disappointment in the former vice president's role as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee in her contentious hearings over accusations of sexual harassment against Clarence Thomas in 1991.
After several questions relating to the personal hardship Hill endured during and after the hearings, host Andrea Mitchell asked, "Could you conceive of voting for Joe Biden if he turns out to be the Democratic nominee against Donald Trump?"
Hill quickly responded, "Of course, I could."
In April, Hill told the New York Times that Biden had called her ahead of his presidential campaign announcement to apologize for what she went through during the hearings. In an interview after Biden's phone call, she told the Times, "I hold him responsible certainly for what happened in 1991, and to the extent that many of the same things that happened in 1991 followed in 2018, there is a connection." When asked directly about Biden's apology, Hill declined to categorize his comments to her as an apology, saying, "Sen. Biden and I have had a conversation, and I think he said to me exactly what he has said to the American public."
In an appearance on "The View" Following Hill's comments to the New York Times, Biden said of the 1991 hearings, "I don't think I treated her badly."iFrame Object

Criminal charges are dismissed in Flint water crisis

Texto completo: LANSING, Mich. – The Michigan Attorney General's Office has dismissed all pending criminal charges arising from the Flint drinking water crisis, saying it has instead started over with an expanded investigation.
The office on Thursday announced the dismissal of charges against all eight remaining defendants, including an involuntary manslaughter charge against Nick Lyon, the former director of the Department of Health and Human Services. Charges also were dismissed against other officials from the health department, plus two former Flint emergency managers and current or former employees of the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality and the City of Flint.
Fifteen people had been charged under former Attorney General Bill Schuette, a Republican, and special prosecutor Todd Flood. Seven had pleaded no contest to misdemeanors, with expectations their records would eventually be wiped clean.
Tens of millions of dollars in taxpayer money have been spent on the investigation and to pay the criminal defense bills of the state and city defendants. The statement from the office of Attorney General Dana Nessel said the dismissals were a response to problems with the original investigation, launched under Schuette, and don't preclude recharging the original defendants or adding new ones.
Flint's water crisis began in April 2014, when a state-appointed emergency manager switched the city's drinking water supply from Lake Huron water treated in Detroit to Flint River water treated at the Flint Water Treatment Plant. It was a temporary, cost-saving measure but turned out to be a disastrous mistake. State regulators have acknowledged they failed to require needed corrosion-control chemicals as part of the treatment.
After Flint River water began flowing, corrosive water caused lead to leach from joints, pipes and fixtures, causing a spike in toxic lead levels in the blood of Flint children and other residents. Investigators also investigated possible links between the water switch and a spike in Flint-area deaths related to Legionnaires' disease. The manslaughter charges stemmed from some of those deaths.
Flint switched back to Detroit water in October 2015, and tests show water lead levels now within federal limits. But many residents have lost trust in drinking the water, even with filters, and some risk remains because of possible spikes resulting from ongoing work to replace Flint's lead pipes.
Nayyirah Shariff, director of the grassroots group Flint Rising, described the announcement as "a slap in the face to Flint residents."
"This has been bungled," she said. "I don't know what's going on."
A "community conversation" is set for Friday in Flint with Solicitor General Fadwa Hammoud.
Flint resident Melissa Mays, founder of Water You Fighting For, said she learned about the dismissals from a New York Times reporter.
"It's extremely terrifying," she said. "Now, we have people who may or may not know what is going on," and "all it does is reinforce that our voices mean nothing."

Texto completo: David Spade, who will perform Tuesday, June 18 at Table Mountain Casino, will get a nightly show on Comedy Central later this year.
The actor and comedian is the latest to try the 11:30 p.m. Monday to Thursday slot after "The Daily Show With Trevor Noah," which under Noah or previous host Jon Stewart had great success with "The Colbert Report" but failure with newer shows featuring other former "Daily" correspondents Larry Wilmore and Jordan Klepper.
The new show, expected to steer clear of politics, is another try for the network, too: Spade also led "The Showbiz Show," which aired 39 episodes in 2005.
Like that series, the untitled new show includes Spade's "signature take on the pop culture news of the day," Comedy said in announcing the series at the Television Critics Association, and "a rotating group of Spade's comedian and celebrity friends," along with field segments based on his Instagram stories.
Spade, a former "Saturday Night Live" cast member, also starred in TV comedies "Rules of Engagement" and, more recently, short-lived ABC comedy "The Mayor," which aired in fall 2017.
The USA TODAY NETWORK recently caught up with Spade to ask him some questions.
USA TODAY NETWORK: We were talking about your show in the newsroom this morning, and our consensus was that you're really busy right now. Talk about your touring show. What are people in for when they see it?
David Spade: (Laughs). Major things happening! Uh, no, I've been doing stand-up for a long time, and there's definitely a bunch of places I've heard about but I've never been through.
Q.: Back to the theme of how busy you are. I'm going to read a couple of quotes from reviewers about things you've done recently. Just give me your reaction.
For "Father of the Year," right after it dropped on Netflix in last year, someone went on the Internet Movie Database and gave it a bunch of stars and said, "People like to dump on these movies but they are far and away better than 'Saturday Night Live' has been in over 10 years."
Spade: (Laughs) I've gone through a life of not being super-critically acclaimed. I haven't had that stigma of great reviews. I still do my best and there's definitely a crowd for these movies.
It's a fun R-rated, like, throwback to early "Happy Madison" stuff (Adam Sandler's production company founded in 1999). When I read it, it made me laugh, and me playing a drunk dad who gets in fights is funny and I have a New Hampshire accent. It did well for Netflix, so I think I'm going to do more movies for Netflix now. I understand it's not everyone's cup of tea, and that's OK, too.
Q.: Here's another review. Your new Audible book, "A Polaroid Guy in a Snapchat World," came out last year and immediately hits No. 4 on the New York Times audiobook list. On Audible's page for the book, literally in the first review posted, this person gives the book five stars but then she says, "Much better than the first one!" So at least she read both of your books, right?
Spade: The first book (2015's "Almost Interesting: The Memoir"), when it's about your whole life, is harder to make a straight-up joke machine. There are family problems, there's how I get into comedy, some of it's just blabbing, just exposition about my life. I didn't know about audiobooks when I did that book, but it did get on the New York Times. They said afterward that the audiobook did a bit better than expected. I thought, wow, OK, I had an idea for a concept book about becoming older. I called Audible and said 'I just want to do an audiobook, not even a book. I think I was the first one to do that over in the comedy world because the first book was good enough to be a stepping stone to get people to trust me to try the second one.
James Ward contributed to this report.
How to attend
David Spade performs at 7 p.m. Tuesday, June 18 at Table Mountain Casino. Tickets are $60-$40. Information: https://www.tmcasino.com/

Sparks Library will host Drag QueenStoryHour

Texto completo: Jeff Scott has received dozens of emails against a planned drag queen story time at a local library this month. He's answered all of them the same way.
"We hope that events like these will encourage inclusivity with everyone in our community," said Scott, Washoe County Library's system director.
The Sparks Library will host Drag Queen Story Hour with readings by two drag queens on July 20. It is the first time the Washoe County Library will host the program, which is exactly what it sounds like.
Libraries and bookstores organize the reading, working with local people in drag. The event is geared towards children ages 3-8, and drag queens read three to four children's books.
'It opens minds' In Sparks, the readers will be Aspen Meadows and Ginger Devine, the Reno News & Review Drag Queen of the Year in 2015.
"You get to see them in person and it opens minds," Scott said.
The Draq Queen Story Hour is a nonprofit based in New York, with readings starting four years ago in San Francisco. It has grown in popularity, with events in dozens of cities across the country.
"For us, we thought this program would complement the Northern Nevada Pride Parade," Scott said.
"We have a team of people that come up with ideas, and this came after we walked in the Pride Parade last year," Scott said of annual event, to be held this year on July 27 in Wingfield Park.
Lessons in acceptance Drag Queen Story Hour "helps children develop empathy, learn about gender diversity and difference, and tap into their own creativity," according to the group's website. "DQSH can also be life-changing and ultimately life-saving for LGBTQ kids and teens, kids with LGBTQ parents or family members, and anyone who feels different because of their identity or interests or who may not otherwise see themselves reflected in the broader culture."
Reno mom Vanessa Vancour will take her daughters to Drag Queen Story Hour.
She also took them to the school board meeting when the board voted against approving lessons on sexual orientation and gender identity as part of the sex-ed curriculum.
"This gave me a chance to have conversations about the importance of standing up for other people," Vancour said.
Vancour said her daughters kept asking why people were speaking against teaching students about gender issues.
"We are very lucky because not all people can be their real self," she told them.
Conservative group urges protest The conservative Nevada Family Alliance has been using social media to encourage people to contact the library "and urge them to stop this use of public funds to promote a controversial lifestyle."
The group said on its website that they support citizens advocating for their values including parental rights, sanctity of life, marriage and family.
After mounting protests against the Washoe County School District's sex education curriculum, the group wrote on the Facebook post, "Well, just when you thought it couldn't possibly get any worse, public tax dollars are being used to host a 'Drag Queen Story Time' by the Washoe County Public Library. Yup, adult men dressed in makeup, wigs, and women's clothing will be reading books to children in attendance."
Nevada Family Alliance has not immediately responded to a request for comment.
The program has been protested in other cities.
A June 6 New York Times piece reported that, as the story time has grown to cities around the world, so has the backlash.
Larry Housholder, a state representative from Ohio, called the story time "a stunningly bizarre breach of the public trust," and said that taxpayers do not want teenage boys instructed on how to become drag queens, the Times reported.
Two story hours in Ohio were canceled after threats.
Organizers have been harassed and received death threats in other cities, too.
That doesn't bother Scott, who has received a few dozen emails against the event. He said there is a free speech zone outside the library if anyone wants to protest the event.
"This event will not be canceled," he said. "I am happy that we can provide events like these for our community."
The Drag Queen Story Hour is at 10:15 a.m. July 20 at Sparks Library at 1125 12th St. To see frequently asked questions about Drag Queen Story Hour, go to www.dragqueenstoryhour.org.

Texto completo: Two dozen cages holding child and infant mannequins peppered the streets and public areas of Manhattan and Brooklyn on Wednesday as part of a political campaign called #NoKidsInCages, created by immigration advocates and a partnering advertising agency with the hope of abolishing family separations at the U.S. border with Mexico.
The lifelike installations were placed at - and later removed from - at least eight locations, according to the NYPD, including areas near the Manhattan offices of The New York Times, Fox News and CNN. Other sites included the American Museum of Natural History on the Upper West Side, and the lower Manhattan entrance to the Brooklyn Bridge, which draws an onslaught of tourists in the summertime.
The cages were equipped with audio recordings obtained by ProPublica last year that captured the cries of children living in a real detention camp along the U.S.-Mexico border, according to RAICES, one of the groups behind the effort.
Texas-based RAICES, the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services, which provides legal counsel to immigrants at little to no cost, partnered with advertising agency Badger & Winters to bring attention to family separations at the southern border following President Donald Trump's implementation of a "zero-tolerance policy" for migrants entering the country illegally.
Images of young children separated from their mothers under the since-rescinded policy prompted national backlash, including a legislative proposal to permanently bar the practice introduced by Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-Manhattan) in January.
The legislation has not come to a vote in the House, though Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) introduced a similar bill in the Senate earlier this month with 31 co-sponsors.
The NYPD did not comment Wednesday on whether the 16 other locations provided in a list by RAICES and Badger & Winters had been investigated.
Trump's immigration policy, announced in April 2018 and reversed two months later, separated thousands of migrant children from their families after they made their way to the border.
The Trump administration said in April that it could take up to two years to identify all the separated children, of whom a potential 2,654 minors were identified by the government in court documents last October in a case brought by the American Civil Liberties Union.

Texto completo: At 19, Samuel Buelow felt he had to leave Los Alamos to be himself.
He had grown up as a girl in the insular, scientific community that felt deeply conservative in the late 1990s and early 2000s. After moving to Pittsburgh for college, Buelow came out as a transgender, gay man.
"It was definitely something, at the time, I felt I couldn't have done living here full time," Buelow said of Los Alamos. "There was very little awareness of these issues in general. And when there was, it was surrounded by some pretty intense homophobia and transphobia."
That was then.
This ... is a town sporting different colors.
On Monday, a rainbow flag was raised for the first time in front of the Otowi Building on the Los Alamos National Laboratory campus, flapping alongside the U.S. and New Mexico banners. Lab officials said it will fly for the remainder of the week.
It was another sign of change at the lab, which in previous years has undertaken different pride representations, including decorating the windows of a prominent building with rainbow-colored Post-it Notes in 2017.
CJ Bacino, the laboratory's diversity officer, said a Los Alamos lab LGBTQ staff and allies group called Prism brought forward the idea of raising the flag this year to help mark Pride Week in Los Alamos County.
LANL and Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque both are affiliated with National Lab Pride, an organization founded in 2016 with roughly
80 members representing 14 of the Department of Energy's
17 national laboratories.
Tom Gallant, a program manager at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California, said National Lab Pride was formed to foster a better sense of belonging, as well as information sharing, among the Department of Energy's lab workforce. And Bacino said LANL "has a pretty robust diversity and inclusion strategy in place," including recruiting, retaining and creating a positive work environment for a variety of groups, including the LGBTQ population.
A more inclusive atmosphere wasn't always the case at the national labs.
A new documentary, The Lavender Scare, based on a book of the same title, explores how, on the heels of the McCarthy-era hunt for American communists, federal employees also were interrogated over their sexual orientation. Thousands of investigations were conducted, with people removed from their jobs by the hundreds. In some cases, researchers said, federal employees took their own lives as a result of the persecution.
"No one was defending gay people," filmmaker Josh Howard told CBS News. "The Democrats stayed away from this issue. At the time, the ACLU believed it was perfectly legitimate for the government to fire homosexuals as a threat to national security."
Until the early '90s, federal workers and scientists at LANL and Department of Energy facilities around the country could be denied security clearance on the basis of sexuality. Even after President Bill Clinton signed a 1995 executive order barring the practice, some continued to be denied clearance if they had not come out to family or friends, according to a 1995 New York Times story. And only in 1998 did the White House ban employment discrimination related to sexual orientation.
Some Department of Energy workers remember when discrimination based on sexuality was rampant. Michele Kahn had been living as an openly gay woman for years when she was hired by Sandia Labs in 1992. During her security clearance investigation, she was asked to list the names of her current and past partners, and to call her mother to confirm her family was aware she was a lesbian.
The interviewer "zeroed in on my sexual orientation," she wrote in a blog post for Sandia in June 2017.
Despite a network founded for gay, lesbian and bisexual employees in 1987, Kahn wrote, "Meetings had generic titles to avoid accidentally outing members when others viewed their calendars. People worried that associating with the LGB group would negatively impact their careers."
Though flags remain symbolic, Buelow, a researcher for the Los Alamos Historical Society, said there is a different feeling on the Hill today. This week, for example, has been designated as the annual LGBTQ and Pride Week in Los Alamos County, culminating in a festival Friday.
"The very fact that we had a Pride [commemoration] was so monumental last year," Buelow said. That it was well attended and positively received, is "something I would have never dreamed possible for this community.
"Things are absolutely improving," said Buelow, 36.
Still, he said past discrimination has left a blank spot about the LGBTQ community in Los Alamos history. He is working on a project about the Cold War experience in Los Alamos for the historical society but said there is little archival information about what those in the LGBTQ community faced at the time.
"There were people living here who were either gay or trans -- LGBT in some capacity -- but as far as I know, we know relatively little about who these people were or how they managed the issues surrounding secrecy or government clearance or blackmail and those types of issues," he said, referring to discriminatory practices of the past.
Buelow said he hopes this year to launch an oral history of untold Los Alamos stories -- including remembrances from those who still don't want to be identified as a gay, bisexual or transgender.
There are, "people who were here during the Cold War era who still aren't out. ... They have managed this their entire lives but still are not in a position where they tell many people."
Now, he said, Los Alamos is changing -- and with it the recognition of stories that have long been suppressed.
"It is an issue that I think has just been under the surface for a long time," he said.

Bernie Sanders socialism speech warns of authoritarianism, but ignores the brutal legacy of communism

Texto completo: Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., on Wednesday gave what was billed as a major speech outlining his sweeping vision for "democratic socialism" that he said would require nothing short of "political revolution."
In the speech, he warned of the need to rise up against the "forces of oligarchy and authoritarianism." The concentration of wealth among billionaires, he said, was depriving the masses of the ability to share the benefits of economic growth, and this economic frustration was being exploited by nationalists throughout the world, including President Trump.
"This authoritarian playbook is not new," Sanders said. "The challenge we confront today as a nation, and as a world, is in many ways not different from the one we faced a little less than a century ago, during and after the Great Depression in the 1930s. Then, as now, deeply-rooted and seemingly intractable economic and social disparities led to the rise of right-wing nationalist forces all over the world."
Sanders goes on to mention the massive 1939 Nazi rally in Madison Square Garden as evidence that "dark forces" also tried to organize in the United States, but in his telling, they were thwarted because of FDR's bold economic policies.
What's interesting, and quite telling, in the Sanders analysis of totalitarian movements in the 20th century is that he ignores the totalitarian threat of communism. He mentions Mussolini and Hitler, but does not mention Stalin.
Under communism, angry rhetoric about the concentration of wealth and promises of a more economically equal society evolved into a bloody system of global oppression that was responsible for an estimated 100 million deaths, making it, as author David Satter put it, the "greatest catastrophe in human history."
It also got much closer to becoming a reality in the U.S. than Nazism, with high-ranking government officials serving as communist agents.
In the case of Sanders, his failure to bring up any of this when talking about authoritarian threats is a major omission, especially given his long history of active support for communist regimes. In the 1980s, Sanders visited and warmly praised the authoritarian Cuba and the Soviet Union. As the New York Times reported, he also visited Nicaragua and praised the communist government, attending a Sandinista rally where the crowd chanted, "Here, there, everywhere, the Yankee will die." Liberal Jonathan Chait has argued that Sanders has not properly responded to questions about his support for the Sandinistas.
This is especially scary given that his prescription for America closely parallels his past praise for communist governments.
In his speech, Sanders calls for a new Bill of Rights. Whereas the original Bill of Rights protected individual liberties by describing actions that the federal government could not take against states and individuals, the Sanders revision would manufacture new rights that require the violation of individual liberty.
To Sanders, the nation cannot achieve "true freedom," without free healthcare, affordable housing, free higher education, and a guaranteed job of at least $15 per hour. But this agenda would require mass confiscation of earnings not only of the very rich, but of middle and lower income Americans. It would also mean restrictions on individuals and not just corporations. For instance, individuals would no longer be able to purchase private insurance that duplicates any of the benefits offered by his new government run plan.
Sanders also declared that, "the only way we achieve these goals is through a political revolution."
In 1989, as reported by my colleague Joseph Simonson, Sanders wrote, "For better or for worse, the Cuban revolution is a very profound and very deep revolution. Much deeper than I had understood. More interesting than their providing their people with free health care, free education, free housing ... is that they are in fact creating a very different value system than the one we are familiar with."
Sure, Sanders claims he's talking about a revolution in which the people take on corporate interests through the democratic process.
But if Sanders is going to draw a connection, as he does in this speech, between Trump and fascist movements of the 1930s, he needs to seriously grapple with the fact that his own ideology, in practice, has often turned into authoritarianism. This is especially true given his long history of having praised brutal authoritarian regimes.

Texto completo: El presidente Donald Trump desató críticas y burlas en redes sociales por presumir un papel en blanco como muestra de que tiene un documento firmado por el Gobierno del mexicano Andrés Manuel López Obrador , donde se contempla un “plan secreto”, como parte de los acuerdos para evitar aplicar aranceles a México.

El Gobierno mexicano ha negado que haya un acuerdo secreto.

New York Times pulls plug on its political cartoons after anti-Semitism furor

Texto completo: The New York Times has decided to end its political cartoons altogether, after the backlash over an anti-Semitic cartoon it published in its international edition.
Longtime Times cartoonist Patrick Chappatte expressed his sadness over the paper's decision in a statement on his own website, and issued a warning about the toxic effects of social media outrage mobs on journalism.
"In April 2019, a Netanyahu caricature from syndication reprinted in the international editions triggered widespread outrage, a Times apology and the termination of syndicated cartoons," Chappatte explained. "Last week, my employers told me they'll be ending in-house political cartoons as well by July. I’m putting down my pen, with a sigh: that’s a lot of years of work undone by a single cartoon - not even mine - that should never have run in the best newspaper of the world."
"I’m afraid this is not just about cartoons, but about journalism and opinion in general," Chappatte continued. "We are in a world where moralistic mobs gather on social media and rise like a storm, falling upon newsrooms in an overwhelming blow. This requires immediate counter-measures by publishers, leaving no room for ponderation or meaningful discussions. Twitter is a place for furor, not debate. The most outraged voices tend to define the conversation, and the angry crowd follows in."
CNN's Jake Tapper, himself a cartoonist, condemned the Times' decision Monday as "horrible."

The cartoon in reference was an anti-Semitic depiction of a blind, yarmulke-clad President Trump being led around by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who was portrayed as a dog in a Star of David leash.
The image sparked outrage, leading to protests outside the Times' office in New York City.
Blaming its publication on "a production editor who did not recognize its anti-Semitism," the Times' editorial board also opined at the time that the cartoon was evidence that "this ancient, enduring prejudice [of anti-Semitism] is once again working itself into public view and common conversation."
"The responsibility for acts of hatred rests on the shoulders of the proponents and perpetrators," they continued. "But history teaches that the rise of extremism requires the acquiescence of broader society. As anti-Semitism has surged from the internet into the streets, President Trump has done too little to rouse the national conscience against it."

Texto completo: SANTA MONICA, Calif. -- Raphael Bob-Waksberg insisted that his debut book is optimistic, even if the numbers didn't quite add up.
In his sun-filled kitchen, he thumbed through the pages of his new short story collection, "Someone Who Will Love You in All Your Damaged Glory," delivering a happy-or-not verdict to each entry. The final tally tipped heavily toward bleak. "Nothing but despair," he conceded with "Move Across the Country," about a woman attempting to outrun her feelings ("Hope the Sadness can't be as fleet as you are, hope the Sadness is more rooted").
Gloom might be expected from Bob-Waksberg, the 34-year-old creator of "BoJack Horseman." The Netflix animated series has won accolades for its treatment of sobering human questions that run underneath the goofy veneer of an animal-populated Hollywood. With his book, he has taken a somewhat romantic turn, one that retains his somber sensibilities.
"The idea of a book of love stories conjures maybe something different in the imagination from what the book is," he said ahead of his book's Tuesday release, a new season of "BoJack" and another television series, "Undone," that he is working on for Amazon. "I don't know if this is a thing you want to give your beloved as a token of your affection, necessarily."

The 18 stories in "Someone Who Will Love You" play with formats -- some are bulleted lists, one consists of wry commentary from a can of cashews, another is told from the perspective of a dog, based on Bob-Waksberg's real-life poodle mix, Stilton, who whimpered periodically at his feet while we talked. Some of the stories began as potential screenplays or comedy sketches.
"It starts with the wacky, crazy concept," he said. "And then, kind of the fun challenge is: How do I make you care in a way that doesn't feel like it's betraying the funny, silly concept, but actually almost feels like this funny, silly concept is the only way into the story?"
Beyond their unusual setups, the stories often veer into the melancholic: a satire of theater turns into a tale of guilt and grief, a list of instructions for "Taboo" reflects the fatigue of a couple facing a disintegrating relationship.
In "We Men of Science," a BoJack-esque strain of questioning peeks through an absurdist sci-fi world. A character asks about how her happiness might be affected by stepping through the "Anti-Door," a portal to an alternate universe. "What if I was zero percent happy," she wonders, "and I walked through the door to find that a hundred percent happy still isn't all that happy?"
The scene echoes similar questions in his Netflix series, in which characters chase happiness where none can be found. Still, to Bob-Waksberg, both the book and the show embrace an ultimately positive outlook.
He referred to "The Average of All Possible Things," about a woman struggling to see the color in her life after a breakup. "When I say 'BoJack' is optimistic, I think it's optimistic in the way that this story is optimistic -- that it is about overcoming the relentless sadness of life, and it's about finding ways to get through it, which I think is hopeful," he said, before bursting out in laughter.
The hopeless opposite would be to suggest that we are incapable of trudging through the muck, or, even more cynically, to pretend there is no muck, he added.
"He's a lot at once, in general," said one of his younger sisters, Becky Bob-Waksberg. An early reader of his stories, she credited their father for raising them with a nuanced worldview that she said her brother adopted. "He knows that, in a way, things that are good also are sad, and things that are hard also have good parts."
Bob-Waksberg grew up in Palo Alto, Calif., in a family he described as loving and supportive with a Jewish brand of dark humor. His cultural touchstones, in TV (sad episodes of "The Simpsons" like "Lisa's Substitute," the "NewsRadio" episode that addresses its cast member Phil Hartman's death) and literature (Jonathan Safran Foer's "A Primer for the Punctuation of Heart Disease," Katherine Heiny's "How to Give the Wrong Impression"), use humor and tragedy to buoy each other.
The existential pondering and sense of alienation that recur in his work are harder to trace.
"Some of 'BoJack' and some of these stories come from a place of: 'We are all fundamentally broken and can never really be fixed,"' Bob-Waksberg said. "I don't know if I still believe that as a universal truth, or that assumption that kind of girds some of these stories."
The collection's more cynical stories tend to be older pieces, some written nearly a decade earlier. Back then, he assumed, "I'm going to have whatever professional success and whatever personal success I have, and it's never really going to fill that hole in my heart and my soul," he said. "And I'm always going to be yearning, and I'm always going to be a little bit empty for reasons that I don't understand."
"Maybe that's the biggest change in him," said Lisa Hanawalt, a high-school friend and the production designer and producer of "BoJack." Hanawalt, along with Bob-Waksberg's two sisters, referred to his wife of two years as a tipping point. "He is now a happily married man, just totally different than how he was in his 20s," said Hanawalt, whose own animated series, "Tuca & Bertie," began streaming on Netflix last month.
If there is a theme to his book, it might be, Bob-Waksberg said, that "love is hard, and an open question of: 'Is it worth it?"'
He responded to his own question: "I think where I land is yes. And I don't know if the book lands there."
Where it lands might depend on which story, and when it was written.
In the book's acknowledgments, Bob-Waksberg saves his final thank-you for his wife. "About half of these stories are from before I met her and half since," he read aloud, "and I'm convinced if you lined them all up in the order they were written, you could pinpoint the moment where my heart became whole."

Texto completo: Mexican official: Country's dignity 'intact' after tariff talks with U.S.
TIJUANA, Mexico - Mexican Foreign Relations Secretary Marcelo Ebrard has told a cheering crowd near the U.S. border that his country emerged from high-stakes talks over U.S. tariffs "with its dignity intact."
The event was originally scheduled as an act of solidarity in the face of President Donald Trump's threat to impose a 5% tariff on Mexican imports if it did not stem the flow of Central American migrants heading toward the U.S.
But Mexican and U.S. officials reached an accord Friday that calls on Mexico to crackdown on migrants in exchange for Trump backing off his threat.
Israel has right to retain parts of West Bank, U.S. ambassador says
JERUSALEM - The U.S. ambassador in Jerusalem says Israel has the right to retain parts, but not all, of the West Bank.
David Friedman's remarks in an interview with The New York Times published Saturday came about two months after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to begin annexing parts of the West Bank.
It's unclear if the ambassador was revealing a component of the long-awaited Trump administration Mideast peace plan.

CÚCUTA, Colombia - Thousands of people crossed into Colombia on Saturday to buy food and medicine after Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro reopened a border between the countries that had been shut down for the past four months.
Long lines of Venezuelans stood at two international bridges near the city of Cúcuta waiting to have their documents checked by Colombian officials.

Texto completo: "The main focus is five days in a pressure cooker. There's high emotion, the hurricane is hitting the coast, they bring the whirlwinds inside themselves, their relationship issues,"
Mary Alice Monroe
author
TRYON – One of the greatest upsets of Mary Alice Monroe's seemingly sun-kissed life has been the volatile unpredictability of hurricanes.
So the New York Times bestselling author, who lives part-time in Polk County horse country, and part-time on the Isle of Palms near Charleston, has harnessed that raw and raging emotion into what she calls her most autobiographical novel.
Monroe's 22nd book, "The Summer Guests," which will be released June 11, takes place over five days on a Tryon horse farm owned by a woman who takes in various friends all fleeing the hurricane, which changes names from the actual "Irma" to "Noelle."
In real life, Monroe has been evacuated from her barrier island home more times than she can remember.
The last time was during Hurricane Irma in 2017, when she fled to her friends' Cindy and John Boyle's, horse farm in Tryon. The events that occurred there in the company of other evacuees and total strangers, drew out a new love of horses, a deeper commitment to fighting climate change, an appreciation of what she treasures most, and ultimately, maybe a softening of the fear brought on by the destructive storms.
Not to mention, it planted the seed for "The Summer Guests."
Monroe will launch her national book release at 5 p.m. June 7 at the Tryon Fine Arts Center, at a gala fundraiser to support the Lanier Library, a historic community library association that is one of only 16 solely membership libraries in the country.
One of her guests just might be one of her dearest friends, Delia Owens, author of the NYT No. 1 bestseller, "Where the Crawdads Sing," a story also interweaving personal triumph with the whims of the natural world.
"This is my most autobiographical book to date because it's inspired by my own evacuation from the Isle of Palms to Tryon," Monroe said by phone from Charleston earlier this week.
"I've lived on Isle of Palms for 21 years and been evacuated so many times, I have a little PTSD about it. With the sea levels rising, the climate warming, and flooding, evacuation is going to be the question of the decade — how to deal with that, and how to deal with our response to natural disasters. I wanted to put a human point on it with the novel."
Monroe is a nationally bestselling and award-winning author known for weaving themes of nature and conservation into characters' lives, and always accompanied by a particular animal species.
In 2018, her novel, "The Beach House," was adapted into a Hallmark Hall of Fame movie starring former Asheville resident Andie McDowell, Minka Kelly and Chad Michael Murray.
Turtles took center stage in the "Beach House" series, while the beauty of the horse and the equestrian world take the spotlight in her newest novel.
"I always choose an animal to connect with in my novels. Most of us in America don't have horses, but it's still an American and cultural icon," she said. "You connect with this noble beast, you learn about their emotions. I learned they have 15 facial expressions, more than a chimpanzee — who knew? The reader will really connect with the animal."
While Monroe didn't know much herself about horses, and doesn't ride, she found herself falling in love with the culture while riding out the storm two years ago. The Tryon International Equestrian Center opened its barns to evacuated horses, and Monroe and other human evacuees spent their days caring for the horses.
She also met the Bellissimos, Mark and Katherine, owners of the equestrian center, which hosted hundreds of equestrian athletes and horses last September at the FEI World Equestrian Games. Katherine Bellissimo wrote the forward to "The Summer Guests."
"It's a world that we don't know a lot about and I wanted to get a peek into the people involved in the equestrian world," Monroe said.
"I didn't know a lot about it. I studied and went to classes in dressage and talked to the jumping association in Tryon and I attended so many events, and I became a fan."
Her friends' dressage teacher from Venezuela became the character "Angel" in the novel.
"I watched the mistakes and the corrections and began to understand how the slightest movement of rider is a communication to the horse. The details of connection of rider and horse was a parallel to how humans need to connect and pay attention to small signals as well," she said.
Monroe especially became inspired by the para-equestrians. She befriended Katie Jackson, an aspiring Olympian who lost a leg to cancer. Jackson became the character "Gerda" in the novel.
"The main focus is five days in a pressure cooker. There's high emotion, the hurricane is hitting the coast, they bring the whirlwinds inside themselves, their relationship issues," Monroe said.
"At the end, the question all the characters ask themselves is what the reader will ask, 'When I leave, what do I take with me? What do I treasure?'"
She said she refers to this book as the "Big Chill" with horses – "five days where lives have changed, people interact and they are not the same."
She said even though it deals with a serious situation, there is a lot of humor in the book, with characters larger than life.
"I remember one night, there were five women in kitchen, a baby was crying, the dogs were barking because my dog was in heat, we were cooking spaghetti laughing and drinking wine. ... I looked around at all these women helping each other. When I came home, I knew I had a novel. It was about women helping each other in times of trouble."
She also touches on the trouble brewing with climate change, the gradual warming of the Earth due to the burning of fossil fuels, although she said she doesn't "hammer the message" because her books are fiction.
She belongs to many conservation groups, and has been on the Isle of Palm's Turtle Team for 20 years, working with other women to watch over the sea turtles as they come to shore to nest, and also works with dolphins and birds of prey
"Just this season, we have had the earliest turtle nesting season to date. It's almost a month ahead of schedule, and we are finding the incubation phase of eggs is getting shorter," Monroe said.
"The sex of the turtle is heat determinant, so we are expecting and finding an increase on females as the sand gets hotter, which will have an impact on the species. Climate change is affecting timing of migrating birds. The least terns that nest often on roofs and rocks, and beach nests, their eggs are roasting. It's just too hot."
She has just launched a Facebook page, Light One Candle, to help people fight climate change through suggestions for small steps they can take each day, such as eliminating single-use plastics, like bags, balloons and straws, which often find their way to the ocean.
"I want people to participate in the solution in their own lives because anxiety is very real. If we can give people opportunities to talk and act, it combats apathy and fear."
"The main focus is five days in a pressure cooker. There's high emotion, the hurricane is hitting the coast, they bring the whirlwinds inside themselves, their relationship issues,"

Most Texas workers will no longer lose their occupational license if they default on student loans

Texto completo: Nurses, teachers and other Texas workers will no longer risk losing their occupational license if they default on their student loans, thanks to legislation signed by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott Friday.
While there is no comprehensive data on how frequently this occurs, a report from The Texas Tribune found more than 4,200 people in the state — including security guards, cosmetologists and pharmacists – were likely at risk of losing their license because of student loan default in 2017. Nearly 250 teachers had an application to renew their educator’s license denied over a five year period, according to the Tribune’s reporting.
Changing the practice was at the heart of a half-dozen pieces of legislation filed during this year's legislative session. The measure signed by the governor Friday was authored by state Sen. Judith Zaffirini, D-Laredo, and sponsored by Rep. Matt Krause, R-Fort Worth. It amassed broad support from lawmakers spanning the ideological spectrum, from liberal Democrats to the most conservative faction of the Texas House, of which Krause is a member. More than 30 legislators signed on to back it.
The new law, which took effect Friday, strikes previous provisions that made defaults grounds to deny, suspend or not renew a professional license. There is now an explicit prohibition on those actions.
In a video posted to Abbott's personal Twitter account Thursday night, the governor said he had some “good news for those who have student loans.”
“I’m about to sign a law that ensures that an occupational license cannot be denied or revoked by the state because of default on student loans,” he said. “It protects your right to earn a living.”
People who default on their student loans can still face sanctions that range from wage garnishment to having their tax refunds withheld. A division in Attorney General Ken Paxton’s office collects on loans issued by the state. A private nonprofit called Trellis Company, which was once a public entity, performs a similar function for old loans made by the federal government.
A 2017 investigation from The New York Times found almost 20 states had laws similar to Texas’ on their books. Several have since moved to amend them. Legislation introduced in Congress by Sens. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, and Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, could also bar states from revoking or refusing to issue professional licenses due to the status of an applicant’s federal student loan debt.
Krause, the sponsor of the new law, said he thought "it was past time for the old policy to be repealed."
"As I've said for a while now, to take away an occupational license for a student loan default is counter-productive and counter-intuitive," he said.
Zaffirini, the author, called the practice "as counter-productive as it is callous."
"This bill demonstrates our interest in encouraging more Texans to pursue higher education," she said.

Texto completo: The party isn’t over for the Warriors but the fun is.
You know this thing has gone off the tracks if you’re the wife of the owner, sitting courtside next to the ultimate rapper power couple, when you lean across Beyoncé to ask Jay-Z if you can get him a lime in his vodka and soda … and are vilified globally.
That’s what happened to Nicole Curran, the wife of Warriors owner Joe Lacob, in Game 3 of the Finals when fans of Beyoncé – known as the Beyhive – decided the video showed their idol’s space being invaded, setting off a viral maelstrom, which, a tearful Curran said, included death threats.
In fact, nothing bad had happened, as confirmed by Beyoncé’s spokesperson who asked fans to “spread love, not hate.”
Unfortunately, all that was spreading that night for the Warriors was pain. Minority owner Mark Stevens, also sitting courtside, pushed away Toronto’s Kyle Lowry, who was chasing a loose ball, then, when Lowry protested, cursed at him.
The NBA barred Stevens for a year, fined him $500,000 and may force him to sell his 7% of the team.
Nor did Game 3 go so hot for the team. The injury-plagued Warriors were totally outclassed by the Raptors, a heretofore little-known crew that had avoided overtime in Game 7 of the second round with the stumbling 76ers on Kawhi Leonard’s shot that bounced four times on the rim … then was thought to be toast after trailing the Bucks 2-0 in the Eastern Conference Finals.
The Raptors led Game 3 for 46:35 of 48 minutes, winning 123-109 as Warriors Coach Steve Kerr took out his starters with 1:37 left, a surrender rarely seen in the Finals.
Remember when the Warriors were the adorable dynasty with cute Steph Curry and his band of merry marksmen?
Remember when they seemed invincible … like last week?
Then, out of nowhere, came this unexpected death struggle, capping a four-year glory run in which the Warriors once posted a record 73-9 finish and then landed Kevin Durant … won three titles, blowing a fourth in 2016 after leading 3-1 … then for the maraschino cherry atop the sundae of their magnificence, got DeMarcus Cousins on a one-year, $5.3 million deal.
Unfortunately for them, or fortunately for fans who tired of their domination and self-inflation, it seemed as if the gods had also had enough of the Warriors, whose starters began disappearing even as they went 12-4 in the West draw.
April 15: Cousins goes out in Game 2 in the opening round against the Clippers.
May 8: Durant is lost in Game 5 in the second round against the Rockets.
June 2: Klay Thompson and Kevin Looney go down in Game 2 of the Finals.
June 5: Raptors go up 2-1 as Curran offers Jay-Z a lime and Stevens reaches out and touches someone. Warriors haters just wish it had involved Lacob, the majority owner, who tipped off his self-importance after winning his first title, telling the New York Times his team was “light years” ahead of the others.
Not that a merely 2-1 deficit discouraged the Warriors. With Thompson returning for Game 4, they expected to lock this up in six games … with them as champions, of course.
“We just gotta continue to battle and win the next game, go back to Toronto, win Game 5, come back to Oracle, win Game 6, and celebrate,” said Draymond Green, team braggart. “Fun times ahead.”
Oops.
June 7: Klay goes for 28 points in Game 4 but they fall again. Once again, it isn’t close, with the Raptors winning 105-92.
With KD hoping to make it back for Game 5, the Warriors now expect to pull this one out in seven.
Win or lose, they’re going into a new arena in San Francisco next season, in which their fans, known for enthusiastically backing the team in the bad times, will have to pay tens of thousands of dollars in personal seat licenses as well as the standard exorbitant ticket prices.
So they may have already played their last game in friendly little Oracle Arena … which their loyal fans commemorated by fleeing up the aisles before it was over.
To give them their due, the Warriors really have been special.
They haven’t just been good but entertaining, sparking a revolution in offense. Curry is surely the greatest shooter in NBA history. Steph and Klay are surely the best shooting backcourt. The Steph-Klay-KD combination is one of the NBA’s greatest.
They’re also nice people. Kerr is a great quote and a super-nice man. Curry is said to be as wonderful a person as he is a player. For all KD’s whining, he’s considered a nice guy. For all Green’s braggadocio, he’s an unfailing stand-up guy who never uses the dodge of blaming his latest outrage on the press.
Lacob deserves his share of credit. It was his idea to hire Jerry West as a consultant, making the Warriors the first team to pay over $1 million for a part-timer … which turned out to be a bargain. If Jeanie Buss had been as savvy as Lacob when West was looking to rejoin her team, the Lakers might be in far better shape.
In the biggest “unfortunately” for the Warriors, more is at stake than one title.
The season has been played under the shadow of Durant’s ambition after he turned down a $150 million extension for a one-year deal to become a free agent this summer.
Insiders have paired Durant and Boston’s Kyrie Irving all season. Now with reports that Kyrie is leaning toward signing with the Nets … and Brooklyn trading salary to get a second maximum slot … the KD Leaves scenario looks ever more real.
It’s not over yet for the Warriors, but we’re about to see how many light years ahead they are now.

Senate Dems urge Fed to probe Deutsche Bank's ties to Trump, Kushner

Texto completo: A group of Senate Democrats is urging the Federal Reserve, a finance industry regulator, to investigate Deutsche Bank's relationship with President Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner.
The seven lawmakers, all members of the Senate Banking Committee, sent a letter to Fed leadership Thursday in response to a recent report in the New York Times claiming Deutsche Bank executives ignored red flags from employees in 2016 and 2017 on accounts associated with Trump and Kushner.
“Only by conducting a thorough review of the full range of this activity can we better understand what happened in these cases; what practices, procedures, or personnel may need to be changed at the bank; and what regulators should do to ensure the Federal Reserve’s ability effectively to monitor compliance with anti-money laundering laws,” the Democrats wrote.
According to the Times, an anti-financial crimes team at Deutsche Bank compiled suspicious activity reports involving entities owned or controlled by Trump and Kushner, a senior White House adviser, after transactions were flagged by the lender's software.
In one instance, an anti-money laundering specialist working for Deutsche in Jacksonville, Fla., discovered money had moved from Kushner Companies to Russians and determined the Treasury Department should be informed.
The suspicious activity reports were ignored by Deutsche Bank executives, however, and never passed on to Treasury regulators.
Deutsche Bank has a long relationship with Trump and has been the only major financial institution willing to work with him over the past two decades.
Those ties have prompted intense scrutiny from congressional Democrats who are investigating Trump’s business dealings and finances. The House Financial Services and Intelligence committees subpoenaed Deutsche Bank in April for Trump’s financial records, but the president sued to block the bank from complying.
A federal judge ruled last month that Deutsche Bank should turn over the records, a decision that Trump's legal team is appealing.
“This overdependence on Deutsche Bank and the heightened potential for conflicts of interest it poses is made more troubling because the president has refused to make any effort to address conflicts of interest or disclose his extensive financial ties, as other presidents and candidates have done in the past,” the Democrats wrote.
The Banking Committee Democrats argued the financial institution’s deep ties to Trump and previous misconduct make its compliance with anti-money laundering laws ripe for review by the Federal Reserve.
Days after Trump took office, the bank was fined $425 million by the state of New York over a money-laundering scheme that regulators said improperly moved $10 billion out of Russia. British regulators fined the lender 163 million pounds, roughly $204 million.
The same month, the bank agreed to a $7.2 billion settlement over claims it misled investors about mortgage-backed securities, the declining value of which in the late 2000s was widely blamed for the 2008 financial crisis.

POPE APPROVES CHANGES TO LORD'S PRAYER 'TEMPTATION' LINE GETS NEW PHRASING

Texto completo: Pope Francis has approved a change to the Lord's Prayer, widely regarded as the best-known prayer in the Christian faith.
The measure, which would change how Catholics around the world recite the prayer, replaces the line "and lead us not into temptation" with "do not let us fall into temptation," uCatholic.com reported.
The move to change the "temptation" phrasing in the prayer was not a spur of the moment decision, but the result of 16 years of research by experts into the current translation of the prayer, according to the Christian Post.
Pope Francis had said in 2017 that he took issue with the "lead us not into temptation" phrasing.
"A father does not lead into temptation, a father helps you to get up immediately," the pope said, according to the Christian Post. "It is not a good translation because it speaks of a God who induces temptation."
"The one who leads you into temptation is Satan," he added. "That's Satan's role."
Christians who have been taught the Lord's Prayer, also known as the Our Father prayer, from the time they were children reacted with surprise to the news of the pope's comments last year. On social media, many reacted with comments such as, "Leave the Lord's Prayer alone!"
French Catholics adopted a linguistic change around the same time Francis spoke about the prayer in 2017, and the pope suggested then that Italian Catholics might want to follow suit.
Philip F. Lawler, editor of Catholic World News, a conservative website, has said that while the pope's critique about the translation of the line "isn't unreasonable," if Francis actually intends to change the prayer, "it's very upsetting" because it is so deeply ingrained for Catholics.
Some conservative evangelicals were also quick to respond.
"This is the Lord's Prayer," said R. Albert Mohler Jr., president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. "It is not, and has never been, the pope's prayer, and we have the very words of Jesus in the New Testament."
The prayer comes from the book of Matthew, in which Jesus teaches his followers, "This, then, is how you should pray," then recites the now-famous words.
The Washington Post and The New York Times contributed.

17-year-old Anisimova pulls off stunner

Texto completo: A 17-year-old American pulled off a shocker Thursday in Paris.
Amanda Anisimova stunned third-ranked Simona Halep in the quarterfinals of the Roland-Garros French Open, cruising to a 6-2, 6-4 victory. The win was Anisimova's first against a top-five player, and it secures her first trip to the semifinals in a major championship.
She will next face Australian Ashleigh Barty in the semifinals.
Who is this young American, who beat the defending French Open champion before her 18th birthday?
Here's a quick look at Anisimova, and how she got to this point.
New Jersey born,
Florida raised
Anisimova is the daughter of Russian immigrants Konstanin and Olga, who moved to the United States in 1998 to provide more tennis-related opportunities for the oldest daughter, Maria, according to The New York Times.
Maria went on to play at the University of Pennsylvania, but Amanda quickly grew into a star.
Born in Freehold Township, New Jersey, in 2001, Amanda later moved to Florida, where many professional tennis players live and train. She now lives in Aventura, Florida.
Why tennis?
Anisimova told WTA's website that she was inspired to pick up the sport by her older sister. But she also loves the individual nature of the sport.
"In tennis, you don't have to depend on anyone," she told WTA's website. "I did gymnastics as a kid, and I liked that too, because I only had to depend on myself.
"It's not like it's all about me, but at the end of the day, if I won or lost, I knew what I had to improve, and couldn't rely on a team."
Rapid ascent
Anisimova made her French Open debut two years ago, earning a wild-card spot when she was 15. She also won one title that year on the ITF Women's Circuit, which is a developmental level below the WTA.
Last year, in her first professional season, she climbed to No. 95 in the world with a handful of solid performances, including a runner-up finish in the Hana-Cupid Japan Women's Open in Hiroshima and a run to the fourth round at Indian Wells.
Anisimova then reached the Round of 16 in January in the Australian Open, where she lost to Petra Kvitova. She was ranked No. 51 in the world entering play at Roland-Garros.
Russian roots
Anisimova speaks Russian with her parents, including her father, who served as her coach earlier in her career. But she told The New York Times in 2017 that she has never visited Russia and never considered representing her parents' home country on the court.
"I do plan on going, though," she told the newspaper in 2017. "I really want to visit and see what it's like and see the culture more."
Anisimova is one of two Russian American players who have made waves at Roland-Garros this week. Another young American of Russian descent, Sofia Kenin upset Serena Williams on Saturday.
Backup plan?
Anisimova said in the 2017 article that she would like to become a surgeon if the whole tennis thing doesn't work out.
"Actually what I want to do is go to online college while I'm in my pro career and then go to med school after I finish," she told The Times in 2017.
In a similar vein, WTA's website reported two years ago that Anisimova "spends her free time reading books and watching Youtube videos about science and chemistry."
"I've always been curious about it, and I think it's pretty cool," she said at the time.

Texto completo: La industria de combustibles fósiles se comporta como la prima donna de la economía nacional. Sin importar las consecuencias catastróficas de sus actuaciones, la administración Trump sigue premiándola con ramos de rosas.
Las comunidades hispanas que sufren las consecuencias de estos desastres, en cambio, solo reciben las espinas.
Un claro ejemplo son los barrios hispanos de Houston —Pasadena, Deer Park y Manchester— que recientemente han sufrido de primera mano varios desastres petroquímicos. El más grave fue el incendio en una instalación de almacenaje de ITC que emitió enormes cantidades de sustancias tóxicas al aire y las vías acuáticas colindantes. Decenas de familias, en su mayoría hispanas, sufrieron los efectos tóxicos de venenos como xileno y benceno.
Este abuso ocurre por todo el país. En los dos últimos años se han dado decenas de desastres petroquímicos similares, al mismo tiempo que la administración Trump ha debilitado las protecciones que ayudan a prevenir estas tragedias.
Un estudio del New York Times reveló que desde su llegada al poder, la administración ha debilitado o eliminado 84 protecciones, favoreciendo abrumadoramente los deseos de los contaminadores fósiles.
Esta insidiosa narrativa —sucio, bueno; limpio, malo— es un desesperado intento de ocultar los verdaderos costes de los combustible fósiles. Según un reporte del Fondo Monetario Internacional, Estados Unidos gasta más en subsidiar los combustibles fósiles que en sus fuerzas armadas. En 2015, los subsidios directos e indirectos al petróleo, carbón y gas alcanzaron los $649 mil millones, mientras que el Pentágono recibió unos $600 mil millones.
El cálculo de estos subsidios incluye las llamadas externalidades de esta industria, incluyendo los descomunales costos de su contaminación a la salud nacional. El estudio también reveló que los subsidios mundiales a esta industria se elevaron a $4,7 billones (trillions en inglés). El FMI llegó a la pasmosa conclusión de que si se hubiera puesto un precio justo a estos combustibles, se hubieran reducido las emisiones climáticas en un 28%, y se disminuirían las muertes prematuras en el mundo en un 50%.
Mientras tanto, el avance de la economía de energía limpia continúa imparable. Cinco estados más Puerto Rico y el Distrito de Columbia, y más de 120 ciudades se han comprometido a generar un 100% de energía limpia, y varios proyectos de construcción de gasoductos han sido derrotados o intensamente confrontados en Carolina del Norte , Maryland , Nueva York , Virginia y Virginia Occidental .
En una economía en la que la energía limpia rápidamente se convierte en su prima ballarina, no hay espacio para prima donnas.

Anisimova told WTA's website that she was inspired to pick up the sport by her aforementioned older sister. But she also loves the individual nature of the sport.
"In tennis, you don’t have to depend on anyone," she told WTA's website. "I did gymnastics as a kid, and I liked that too, because I only had to depend on myself.
"It’s not like it’s all about me, but at the end of the day, if I won or lost, I knew what I had to improve, and couldn’t rely on a team. "
A rapid ascent
Anisimova actually made her French Open debut two years ago, earning a wild-card spot when she was just 15. She also won one title that year on the ITF Women's Circuit, which is a developmental level below the WTA.
Last year, in her first professional season, she climbed to No. 95 in the world with a handful of solid performances, including a runner-up finish at the Hana-Cupid Japan Women's Open in Hiroshima and a run to the fourth round at Indian Wells.
Anisimova then reached the Round of 16 at the Australian Open in January, where she lost to Petra Kvitova. She was ranked No. 51 in the world entering play at Roland Garros.
Russian roots
Anisimova speaks Russian with her parents, including her father, Konstanin, who served as her coach earlier in her career. But she told The New York Times in 2017 that she has never visited Russia and never considered representing her parents' home country on the court.
"I do plan on going, though," she told the newspaper in 2017. "I really want to visit and see what it’s like and see the culture more. "
Anisimova is one of two Russian-American players who have made waves at Roland Garros this week. Another young American of Russian descent, Sofia Kenin, upset Serena Williams on Saturday.
Backup plan?
Anisimova said in the 2017 article that she would like to become a surgeon if the whole tennis thing doesn't work out.
"Actually what I want to do is go to online college while I’m in my pro career and then go to med school after I finish," she told The New York Times in 2017.
In a similar vein, WTA's website reported two years ago that Anisimova "spends her free time reading books and watching Youtube videos about science and chemistry. "
"I’ve always been curious about it, and I think it’s pretty cool," she said at the time.

Texto completo: Dance has been a part of Derek Hough's life since he was a child, but he is also an accomplished musician, actor and singer. In his new stage show, "Derek Hough Live! The Tour," he showcases his many talents and opens up with audiences on a more personal level.
Hough is best known as a cast member on "Dancing With the Stars," a TV competition he has won six times. He won two Emmy Awards for his choreography on the show. He recently served as a judge alongside Jennifer Lopez and Ne-Yo on the TV show "World of Dance."
He has played Corny Collins in "Hairspray Live!," been the male lead in a London production of "Footloose" and had a recurring role on the TV show "Nashville." His book "Taking the Lead: Lessons from a Life in Motion" was a New York Times bestseller.
This tour is a different experience for Hough, who is used to working with his sister. In 2014, 2015 and 2017, he toured with Julianne Hough, also an accomplished dancer, actress and singer.
His new show isn't just him on stage alone, though. He has dancers and a band. The show crosses genres, presenting Motown, Latin, rock-and-roll, big band, hip hop and other styles of music and dance. Hough plays the guitar and drums, along with singing and dancing.
He talked about his solo tour during a recent telephone interview.
Question: How have audiences been responding to your tour?
Answer: The audiences' response, the reactions, the reviews have been overwhelming. I've worked so hard on this show, putting together something that appeals to such a wide demographic, everybody from kids to 90-year-olds and everybody in between.
I really get personal, and I get quite vulnerable in the show towards the end, having a chat. The response so far from everybody has been just beautiful. I'll sign autographs and sign posters after the show, and I ask a lot of people what's their favorite part.
What's so wonderful to hear is everybody has a different favorite part that they love the most. Some will be in tears from the emotional parts of the show, and some are having a blast, having fun, standing up and dancing. It captures all of the different emotions.
Q: Do you feel it's changed how people look at you?
A: There's a lot of singing in the show. I do "Singin' in the Rain," Michael Buble songs and some Top 40 stuff. It's wonderful to share that aspect of what I do as well.
For me to have done so many different tours and for people to come up to me and say that they really, really loved this one, it just makes me so happy. I'm always trying to get better and better, elevate and make the best show possible for these audiences.
Q: What went into choosing the dancers for your show?
A: I picked dancers that can do things that I can't. There's certain things that I'm an expert at, and there are certain areas that aren't necessarily my strongest areas. Every night, I'm blown away by what they are producing on that stage, just their technique, their grace and their athleticism.
Q: When you were getting ready for the show, did it feel different working with them compared to your sister?
A: The biggest difference was trying to figure out how I was going to be onstage for the entire time, or where I was going to not be onstage. It was very important for me to have dancers who were so good that it didn't matter if I was onstage or not.
Also, the one big change for this show is I have a live band. That was a big part of the process. It took a lot more thought, a lot more time. I did all the arrangements and was in the recording studio, putting together music. The band was rehearsing, and we were dancing in the room. What it has done is it has made the show feel more like a concert.
Q: How long did it take to put together the show?
A: It took a long time. The thing that took the longest was the music, getting the music and the set list together. I wanted such a big variety of music that covers the whole spectrum of genres and music that inspires us to move and dance. Also, I wanted to pick music that was meant to be played live. I wanted this music to really pop and really feel exciting when you hear it.
Q: How did you decide what music to use?
A: I picked music that I get excited about but also music that I know that my audience will love as well, infusing them, combining them, updating some of them, changing some of these songs and making them feel more contemporary. For me, what's awesome is after the show having a 6-year-old come up to me and say how much she loved the music and, in the same moment, having a 70-year-old come up to me and say how much she loved the music.
Q: Did you have to brush up on any dance styles for the show?
A: I tap a lot in the show. For me, I love tap dancing so much. I had to definitely work hard on brushing up on my tap. I do a really challenging routine in the show. It's very demanding, very physical. Fortunately, I keep sharp in my styles and what I do, and I work hard, train and practice a lot. When it came to rehearsal, I was ready to go.
Q: It sounds like you've really challenged and pushed yourself with this show.
A: This definitely is a challenging show for everybody, including our dancers. The dancers are working extremely hard. It's a full-out show. When people come and see the show, I think they're surprised by the amount of energy that is exerted on that stage.
Q: What do you hear consistently that audiences always love and get excited about?
A: There's a moment where I get really personal. I really open up about struggles that I've gone through and how we all share this vulnerability. We all share these thoughts, these doubts in our mind. I've really heard from a lot of people that it touched them. It really moved them tremendously. That's my goal. I really just want to inspire, motivate or connect with the audience.
Q: Have your dancers and band helped to shape the show?
A: A lot of the big moments, it could only happen because of the talent of the musicians or the dancers. Being a choreographer isn't just about creating moves that you want to see. It's about bringing the best out in who you have. A lot of times, I will say, "Do something amazing here," and they will do something that is in their wheelhouse and only they can bring that to the table. There are so many of those moments that each dancer brings that couldn't have happened without them.

Texto completo: En el Congreso avanzan las voces en contra la decisión del presidente Donald Trump de imponer aranceles del 5% al 25% a productos mexicanos, al grado que senadores advirtieron que se oponían a sus planes.
Esto luego de que el presidente Trump afirmara desde Inglaterra –donde fue a visita de Estado– que los representantes serían “unos tontos” si intentaran bloquear la medida contra México, a partir del 10 de junio.
Aunque defienden la seguridad en la frontera –la principal razón por la que el mandatario impone las tarifas– rechazan que los impuestos se conviertan en una medida de presión, porque afectaría a productores estadounidenses.
El respaldo incluso llegó de senadores que abiertamente defienden al mandatario en casi todas sus medidas, como Ted Cruz , de Texas, reportó The New York Times.
“No me rendiré a nadie con pasión, seriedad y compromiso para asegurar la frontera” , dijo Cruz. “Pero no hay ninguna razón para que los granjeros, ganaderos, fabricantes y pequeñas empresas de Texas paguen el precio de nuevos impuestos masivos” .
Para otro republicano de Texas, John Cornyn , la medida del mandatario es como un suicidio comercial.
“Estamos apuntando un arma a nuestras propias cabezas” , expresó.
La determinación del presidente Trump incluso causó la reacción del titular de la Reserva Federal, Jerome H. Powell , quien insinuó que el Banco Central podría reducir las tasas de interés si la guerra comercial comenzara a dañar la economía.
Los 10 estados que podrían ser más afectados por esta “guerra” serían Arizona, Nuevo México, Texas, Michigan, Rhode Island, Missouri, Nebraska, Dakota del Sur, Iowa y Utah.
En Washington, D.C. hay una delegación mexicana, liderada por el canciller Marcelo Ebrard , para reunirse con su contraparte estadounidense, liderada por el vicepresidente Mike Pence y el secretario de Estado, Mike Pompeo .

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Following a report by the Daily Caller that the Biden campaign website appeared to have plagiarized passages in its newly released climate policy proposal from advocacy groups, the U. S. government, and a river conservation nonprofit, Joe Biden's campaign website has added attribution for several statements relating to climate change.
On Tuesday morning, the Biden campaign released an ambitious 22-page climate plan that pledged to go "beyond the Obama-Biden Administration platform" on climate.
"As President, I will lead America — and the world — not only to confront the crisis in front of us — but to seize the opportunity it presents," said Biden in a video released along with the plan.
After the release of the climate plan, the campaign was hit with allegations that it had plagiarized some of the talking points in a 22-page document. And late Tuesday afternoon, the campaign sought to clear up the matter, issuing a statement that said several citations in its plan "were inadvertently left out of the final version. "
Josh Nelson, Vice President of CREDO, a liberal advocacy group, tweeted Tuesday morning that Biden's climate plan looked "remarkably similar to items" published by two other climate advocacy groups, the Blue Green Alliance and the Carbon Capture Coalition.
Nelson, who has a background in environmental advocacy, told USA TODAY that the language in the sections on carbon capture did not look like typical presidential campaign language. Instead, "It looked like the type of thing the coal industry, trade groups, and coal companies themselves say about carbon capture and sequestration," he told USA TODAY.
"So I grabbed a couple phrases of that language, and copied and pasted directly into Google," he said, and then found that sections of the proposal were the same as previously posted sources.
The Daily Caller first published a story at 1:51 p. m. on Tuesday reporting on Nelson's tweet and highlighting three other instances of "similarly phrased excerpts. "
The Biden campaign issued a statement Tuesday responding to questions of plagiarism: "Several citations, some from sources cited in other parts of the plan, were inadvertently left out of the final version of the 22 page document. As soon as we were made aware of it, we updated to include the proper citations. "
USA TODAY has confirmed at least five instances in which the Biden campaign has updated parts of its climate change platform to add attribution. The campaign added attribution, but USA TODAY accessed the original version of the climate proposal through the Internet WayBack machine.
On Wednesday evening, the Washington Post highlighted another instance of alleged plagiarism in which a line of the Biden campaigns education platform was taken without attribution from an education policy paper by XQ, an education reform organization.
The allegations of plagiarism
Biden website: "Carbon capture, use, and storage (CCUS) is a rapidly growing technology that has the potential to create economic benefits for multiple industries while significantly reducing carbon dioxide emission. "
September 26, 2017 letter from the Blue Green Alliance to the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works: "Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) is a rapidly growing technology that has potential to create economic benefits for multiple industries while significantly reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. "
Biden website: "Biden’s goal is to make CCUS a widely available, cost-effective, and rapidly scalable solution to reduce carbon emissions to meet mid-century climate goals. "
Carbon Capture Coalition website: "The Carbon Capture Coalition brings together energy and industrial technology companies, labor unions, and energy and environmental policy organizations. Its goal is to make carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS) a widely available, cost-effective, and rapidly scalable solution to reduce carbon emissions to meet mid-century climate goals. "
Biden website: "The average American sewage pipe is 33 years old, with many pipes dating back 50 or even 100 years. "
American Rivers website : "As a result, the average American sewage pipe is 33 years old, with many pipes dating back 50 or even 100 years. "
Biden website: "And 40% of the 567 federally recognized tribes in U. S. live in Alaska where the rapid pace of rising temperatures and melting sea ice and glaciers threaten the critical infrastructure and traditional livelihoods in the state. "
U. S. Climate Resilience Toolkit: "Of the 567 federally recognized tribes in the United States, 40 percent (229 tribes) live in Alaska Native communities. The rapid pace of rising temperatures, melting sea ice and glaciers, and thawing permafrost in Alaska is having a significant negative impact on critical infrastructure and traditional livelihoods in the state. "
XQ education policy paper: “Students who participate in high-quality career and technical education (CTE) are more likely to graduate, earn industry credentials, enroll in college, and have higher rates of employment and higher earnings. ”
Biden website: “Students who participate in high-quality career and technical education are more likely to graduate, earn industry credentials, enroll in college, and have higher rates of employment and higher earnings. ”
Joe Biden withdrew from his first campaign for president in 1987 after it was revealed that he had plagiarized lines of a debate speech from British Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock.
At the time, New York Times reporter Maureen Dowd noted the similarities between Biden's speech and Kinnock's, observing how Biden "lifted Mr. Kinnock's closing speech with phrases, gestures and lyrical Welsh syntax intact for his own closing speech at a debate at the Iowa State Fair on Aug. 23 - without crediting Mr. Kinnock.

Talks Over Access to Report Might Be Back On

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- House Democrats said on Tuesday that they were willing to renew negotiations with the Justice Department over access to the special counsel's full report and investigative files, but rejected a call to pre-emptively cancel a House vote to hold Attorney General William P. Barr in contempt.
Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the Judiciary Committee chairman who issued a subpoena for the materials at the center of a simmering dispute, said he was ready to talk immediately to try to reach a compromise, but only "without conditions" preset by the Justice Department. The House has scheduled the contempt vote for next Tuesday after weeks of refusals by Mr. Barr and his department to comply with the subpoena.
"We urge you not to make the mistake of breaking off accommodations again," Mr. Nadler wrote in a letter to Mr. Barr on Tuesday evening. "We are here and ready to negotiate as early as tomorrow morning."
Mr. Nadler's rejection of the department's request left in doubt whether it would still be willing to engage in talks. Stephen E. Boyd, an assistant attorney general, wrote in a letter to lawmakers earlier Tuesday that the Trump administration was willing to negotiate only if the Judiciary Committee withdrew its recommendation to hold Mr. Barr in contempt and Democrats postponed the final vote.
"The department is prepared to resume negotiations with the committee regarding accommodation of its narrowed subpoena, provided the committee takes reasonable steps" to alleviate the threat of a contempt vote for the attorney general, Mr. Boyd had written. The Justice Department did not immediately comment on Mr. Nadler's response.
If the vote proceeds, it would be only the second time in American history that Congress has held the nation's top law enforcement official in contempt -- a sign of the deep animus the special counsel's investigation has engendered between the legislative and executive branches. In addition to holding Mr. Barr in contempt, Democrats were expected to vote to grant House committees the power to go straight to court in similar future disputes.
[Read the letter from the Justice Department.]
Negotiations between the two sides have been rived with mistrust for months, with both sides pointing fingers over the escalating tensions. Democrats are wary that the Justice Department's latest offer could be merely a stalling tactic to try to at least delay the contempt vote rather than a good-faith step toward accommodation. And the department has maintained that Democrats are being unreasonable in the scope and speed of their demands.
With the contempt vote looming, Mr. Nadler had written the department on May 24 that the committee was willing to narrow and prioritize its request to "specific materials that if produced would be deemed to satisfy the subpoena," including summaries of F.B.I. interviews with roughly 30 witnesses, as well as notes taken by key witnesses and White House documents cited in the report and related to possible obstruction of justice. He also said he would be willing to limit a demand over which lawmakers got to see a less redacted version of the report.
Mr. Boyd called the more limited request "more reasonable" and said it "could mitigate some of the legal barriers to disclosure" that the department had earlier objected to.
But even if talks do restart, the two sides appear to be far from a total thaw in hostilities over the Democrat-controlled House's attempt to build a public case that the president obstructed justice in impeding the investigation into his presidential campaign's contact with Russians.
To wit, the last-minute proposal from the Justice Department came only hours after the White House had instructed two more former aides to Mr. Trump not to cooperate with subpoenas from the Judiciary Committee, continuing a crippling blockade of nearly all oversight requests related to the special counsel's investigation.
In a letter to Mr. Nadler, Pat A. Cipollone, the White House counsel, had said that the president's chief of staff had informed the former aides -- Hope Hicks, who served as the White House communications director, and Annie Donaldson, who was the chief of staff to Donald F. McGahn II, the former White House counsel -- that they were not allowed to share the materials in question with Congress because they implicate "significant executive branch confidentiality interests and executive privilege."
[Read the letter from Mr. Cipollone.]
Instead, Mr. Cipollone instructed Congress again to come directly to the White House for any information previously turned over to the special counsel. But he suggested those conversations should be deferred pending the outcome of discussions between the Justice Department and the Judiciary Committee.
Mr. Nadler was furious, arguing that the White House's claims that the material could be protected would not hold up in court.
"Federal law makes clear that the documents we requested -- documents that left the White House months ago -- are no longer covered by executive privilege, if they ever were," Mr. Nadler said in a statement. "The president has no lawful basis for preventing these witnesses from complying with our request."
Under subpoenas issued by the Judiciary Committee, the two witnesses had been instructed to deliver on Tuesday a range of documents related to their work in the White House, including notes and records related to some of Mr. Trump's attempts to thwart federal investigators -- attempts documented by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, in the report he completed in March.
Mr. Nadler said that Ms. Hicks, who also served as a top aide on Mr. Trump's presidential campaign, did produce some documents related to her work before the election. He called it a "show of good faith," though a copy of a letter from Ms. Hicks's lawyer obtained by The New York Times says she handed over only four documents containing email chains.
In addition to documents, the subpoenas call for Ms. Hicks and Ms. Donaldson to testify publicly this month -- and there was no indication on Tuesday whether they would comply. Mr. Nadler made clear his position that both were still expected to show up before the panel. Ms. Hicks has been subpoenaed to appear on June 19 and Ms. Donaldson on June 24.
[Read the Judiciary Committee subpoenas for Ms. Hicks and Ms. Donaldson.]
But there appears to be little chance either former aide will testify, bolstering the case made by a growing number of House Democrats that the president is actively obstructing another branch of government from doing its constitutionally sanctioned oversight function, and that impeachment proceedings are the only proportional response.
The White House issued similar instructions not to cooperate last month to Mr. McGahn, who had served as one of the most important witnesses in Mr. Mueller's investigation into obstruction of justice. He ultimately did not produce a single document or appear for a hearing. If it does not alter course for the Justice Department, the House is poised to hold Mr. McGahn in contempt of Congress next week, as well, and take the dispute to court to try to enforce its subpoena -- steps that could soon follow for Ms. Hicks and Ms. Donaldson if they do not show up to the Judiciary Committee's hearings.
With potential star witnesses off limits and Mr. Mueller reluctant to testify, Democrats have for now been left to try to figure out other ways to bring Mr. Mueller's 448-page report to life. On Monday, Mr. Nadler announced that his committee would hold a series of hearings on the report with former federal prosecutors, legal experts and John W. Dean, who went to jail for his role in the Watergate affair.
Republicans, who remain closely aligned with the president, have repeatedly accused Democrats of being less interested in the truth than in manufacturing a conflict with the White House that could provide a pretext for impeachment. They painted the possibility of new talks between the two sides on Tuesday as further evidence Democrats had been acting irresponsibly.

Texto completo: James Holzhauer's captivating "Jeopardy!" run is officially over, thanks to user-experience librarian Emma Boettcher and a Final Jeopardy wager which host Alex Trebek described as unusually "modest" for the typically big bettor.
Holzhauer, who was just $58,484 from Ken Jennings' all-time record, was going for his 33rd win Monday when he and his two fellow contestants all gave the correct answer in the Final Jeopardy round. The defending champion, known for his aggressive wagering, had $23,400 but bet only $1,399 for a final total of $24,799.
By comparison, Boettcher, who led going into the round, wagered $20,201, and finished with $46,801.
Wondering what was going through his mind? You're not the only one.
“I knew I could only win if Emma missed Final Jeopardy, as there was no way she wouldn’t bet to cover my all-in bet,” Holzhauer explained to The Action Network, a media company that provides sports analysis. “So my only concern was getting overtaken by third place, and I bet just enough to make sure of locking him out.
"Betting big would have looked good for the cameras, but now I turn my straight bet (Boettcher misses) into a parlay (Boettcher misses and I get it right),” he added.
Holzhauer is (finally) unseated as 'Jeopardy!' champion: How did it all come down?
Ken Jennings reacts: Record holder salutes James Holzhauer's 'reign of destruction'
Holzhauer made headlines during his winning streak on the show by taking the board by storm, going for the highest-dollar questions first and hunting for Daily Doubles. Then, he bet big.
In an April interview, the professional sports gambler from Las Vegas told The New York Times in an interview that his huge advantage on the trivia show was that he wasn’t afraid to risk his winnings.
"The fact that I win and lose money all the time helps desensitize me, so I can write down $60,000 as the Final Jeopardy wager and not be trembling at the thought of losing that money," he said.
Who is Emma Boettcher? Meet the 'Jeopardy!' contestant who just dethroned Holzhauer
Opinion: I'll take 'The Importance of Education to Jeopardy!' for $1,000, Alex
Another unorthodox Holzhauer stragegy? He headed straight to the children's section of the library to do his research.
"I’ve found that in an adult reference book, if it’s not a subject I’m interested in, I just can’t get into it," he told the Times. "I was thinking, what is the place in the library I can go to to get books tailored to make things interesting for uninterested readers? Boom. The children’s section. "

LEADING OFF
Happy Tuesday and welcome to Rhode Map, your daily guide to everything happening in the Biggest Little. I'm Dan McGowan and I feel bad for “Jeopardy!" star James Holzhauer. Send tips to Dan.McGowan@globe.com.
How much are Rhode Islanders looking forward to seeing “The Prince of Providence" when it debuts at Trinity Rep later this year?
Well, let's just say Buddy Cianci is entering “Hamilton" territory.
A spokesperson for Trinity Rep confirmed to Rhode Map that the theater is only guaranteeing tickets to the play, based on Mike Stanton's best-selling book, about the felonious former Providence mayor to individuals who subscribe to the whole season of shows.
That's the same policy the Providence Performing Arts Center had when it announced “Hamilton," the hit Lin-Manuel Miranda musical, was coming to the city July 23-Aug. 11. (Note: Individual tickets to “Hamilton" go on sale Saturday.)
“The Prince of Providence" kicks off Sept. 12 and runs through Oct. 20. Those close to Trinity Rep say they can't recall a time where there has been this much demand for a show.
WHAT'S ON TAP TODAY
Each day, Rhode Map offers a cheat sheet breaking down what's happening in Rhode Island. Have an idea? Email us at RInews@globe.com.
• Treasurer Seth Magaziner is holding a press conference at the State House this afternoon to announce he's creating a fund that will support educators who teach personal finance courses in Rhode Island's public schools. This is part of Magaziner's broader push to make those classes mandatory.
• Former Providence Mayor Angel Taveras will be interviewed during a live podcast tonight at Mary Fogarty Elementary School at 6 p.m. It's part of the Rhode Island Foundation's “Pioneers" series, which also included a show with the Globe's Amanda Milkovits .
• Senate President Dominick Ruggerio's attempt to strip Providence of its zoning power on the former I-195 land gets a vote tonight in the Senate Judiciary Committee. Mayor Jorge Elorza strongly opposes the bill, but he'll likely need help from the House to kill it this year.
• The Providence City Council is nearing the finish line on the city budget, as the Finance Committee has a meeting tonight and a public hearing set for tomorrow. Don't forget, most property owners are likely to see a tax increase under the current proposal.

WRAPPING UP
Rhode Map wants to hear from you. If you've got a scoop or a link to an interesting news story in Rhode Island, email us at RInews@globe.com.
• The Providence River Pedestrian Bridge that opens later this year cost $22 million to build. Ed Fitzpatrick found some folks who love it and others who say the money should have been spent elsewhere.
• After you get some Newport Creamery food into US Senator Jack Reed , who knows what he'll say? Don't miss this Globe Q&A, where Rhode Island's senior senator tackles President Trump and foreign policy.
• Writing for ProPublica, Lynn Arditi has another blockbuster on Rhode Island's troubled 911 system.
• The Globe's Kevin Cullen compares Bishop Tobin to President Trump .
• Get ready to see even more Congressman David Cicilline on television now that he's set to lead an antitrust investigation into companies like Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google. In a statement Monday, he said Congress wants to determine whether “existing laws are adequate to tackle abusive conduct by platform gatekeepers or whether we need new legislation to respond to this challenge."
• A big win for Cranston Mayor Allan Fung : The Rhode Island Supreme Court upheld a ruling allowing the city to implement a 10-year freeze on cost-of-living adjustments for retirees. This could also be good news for Providence, which is currently before the high court on a similar matter.

Odds and the end of 'Jeopardy' run

Texto completo: In an upset of extraordinary magnitude, James Holzhauer finally lost on "Jeopardy!" after 32 victories and nearly $2.5 million in winnings. In Monday's telecast of the previously recorded show, Holzhauer is defeated by Emma Boettcher, according to The New York Times.
How unlikely was this?
Going strictly by the available numbers -- that is, the data from his performances and those of hundreds of other recent contestants -- Syracuse University sports analytics professors Shane Sanders and Justin Ehrlich had found that at the start of any given match, there was a 99.3% chance that Holzhauer would win.
Translated into betting odds, you would have gotten 141-1 for a wager against him.
Here's some context on that from the sports world: The University of Maryland-Baltimore County's upset of Virginia in the 2018 NCAA basketball tournament was a 20-1 proposition; Buster Douglas' heavyweight boxing takedown of Mike Tyson was 42-1.
Sanders and Ehrlich had applied probability theory to information compiled on the official "Jeopardy!" website and a fan-created record of the show's games and players called J! Archive.
They also projected that Holzhauer would win 98 more games before losing.
The basic foundation for all of this came from Sanders and Ehrlich examining the likelihood of Holzhauer losing after having led going into the Final Jeopardy round, and the likelihood of him losing after having trailed going into the Final Jeopardy round.
(Primarily because there were very few ties going into Final Jeopardy during the period of pre-Holzhauer matches studied, the professors treated the possibility of a tie as essentially zero.)
What this didn't take into account was the human factor.
For example, according to Sanders and Ehrlich, opponents might have learned better buzzer strategy. Or they could use a betting approach more suited to taking on Holzhauer's aggressive tactics, which include jumping from category to category in search of Daily Doubles rather than staying with one category at a time, as most contestants have done.
Regardless, it wasn't going to be easy.
Holzhauer led going into Final Jeopardy in all 32 of his matches before he lost.
In 29 of those 32, his lead going into Final Jeopardy has been so large that even if his nearest opponent had bet all of their winnings to that point and provided a correct Final Jeopardy response, Holzhauer would have won without a correct response as long as his final wager wasn't greater than the amount of his lead.
However, in Monday's episode, Holzhauer trailed going into Final Jeopardy, according to The Times.
So even though Holzhauer provided the correct response in Final Jeopardy for the 32nd time in his 33 matches, he fell.
Or, as Sanders put it: "It's somewhat like projecting how many months will pass before lightning strikes a building. We can get a good projection that has nice statistical properties. However, statistics provide no guarantees as to when that low-probability event will take place."

Concert review: Bach's breadth, secular and sacred, on display at Maine festival's opening program A top-flight ensemble of Baroque music specialists demonstrates their ample strengths.

Texto completo: It's tempting to think of June as Bach season in Maine, thanks largely to a pair of festivals: the Bach Virtuosi Festival, which got underway Sunday evening at the Cathedral of St. Luke's, and runs through Sunday, and the Portland Bach Experience, which runs from June 14 to 23. Add to that an all-Bach program offered by the DaPonte String Quartet and guest soloists at Bowdoin College on Wednesday.
But in truth, Bach gets plenty of attention here, year-round. As part of its 50th anniversary celebration, the Portland String Quartet played a free performance of "The Art of the Fugue" in December, and in March, Municipal Organist James Kennerley celebrated the composer's birthday with an all-Bach concert, something he plans to do again next season. Bach also figures into two of the four programs announced for the Portland Early Music Festival in October.
That's a pretty solid presence for a composer born 334 years ago, and half a world away, particularly at a time when the classical music world is working hard to update and diversify the repertory. And it seems to prove what most musicians and a great many listeners know: Whether for its virtuosic compositional techniques, its spiritual depths, or the way its demands on players and singers yield dazzling results when the musicians are equal to them, there are qualities in this music that defy the influence of time, place and changing fashion.
Lewis Kaplan, the founder and artistic director of the Bach Virtuosi Festival (and the Portland Bach Festival, from which it emerged), has gathered a top-flight ensemble of Baroque music specialists, several of whom have been with the festival from the start. He also assembled an opening program that introduces these musicians and their ample strengths efficiently, while also offering a glimpse of Bach's compositional breadth, both secular and sacred.
The concert began with an interesting choice. Instead of the the burst of bright-hued energy you might expect as the curtain-raiser at a festival's opening concert, Kaplan and his players opted for depth over sparkle, by way of the solemn Sinfonia from the "Easter Oratorio" (BWV 249) - an instrumental description of the disciples' procession to the tomb, where they are about to discover that Jesus has been resurrected.
It is a simple but emotionally weighty movement, with slow-moving string chords supporting an exquisitely plangent oboe line. John Ferrillo, the principal oboist of the Boston Symphony, gave a bittersweet, nuanced account of that arching solo meditation, and the ensemble's string section supplied a suitably subdued characterization of the downhearted march.
The rest of the program illuminated Bach's more ebullient side. The motet "Singet dem Herrn" (BWV 225) introduced the festival's superb vocal ensemble of eight singers. Presenting this work's writing for double choir with only one voice singing each part may seem unduly spare to listeners who grew up in the days when Bach was the province of large choirs, but it reflects musicological discoveries about the forces available to Bach at the Thomaskirche, in Leipzig, Germany.
More to the point, the single-voice approach exposes the music's inner workings in ways that are obscured in large choir readings. The ensemble was conducted by Sherezade Panthaki (who also sang the soprano lines in Choir I). That said, all eight singers also participated in the performance of Cantata No. 29, "Wir danken dir, Gott" (BWV 29), which closed the program. Two voices to a part is hardly excessive, and was within the possibilities in Bach's Leipzig, and it made sense, given that the cantata, unlike the a cappella motet, is accompanied by a robust ensemble, and demands both solo and ensemble singing.
At any rate, the choir brought to it the same illuminating clarity they brought to the motet, and bass Jonathan Woody, tenor Brian Giebler and countertenor Jay Carter contributed supple solo lines. Much of the joy in this performance, though, was in the instrumental writing, particularly in the Sinfonia, in which Katelyn Emerson navigated the brisk, richly detailed organ line, with magnificent accenting supplied by the ensemble's trumpets, oboes, strings and timpani, in a tight, high-energy performance conducted by Kaplan.
The concert's only secular work, the Brandenburg Concerto No. 2 (BWV 1047), which closed the first half, focused on some of the Virtuosi's instrumentalists. Trumpeter John Thiessen, violinist Adriane Post and flutist Emi Ferguson, along with oboist Ferrillo, each gave powerful, thoughtfully shaped accounts of their solo lines, both when they had the spotlight to themselves, and just as crucially, when they joined forces to bring Bach's finely balanced counterpoint to life.

Texto completo: “Tú vas al hospital y puedes donar tus órganos aunque seas inmigrante” e indocumentado , se lamenta Abigail Martínez , pero “cuando tú eres inmigrante no te pueden dar un riñón, yo creo que es injusto ”.
Su marido, José Antonio Martínez, sufre desde hace cinco años una enfermedad renal, según informa la emisora NY1, y el tratamiento de diálisis al que lleva sometiéndose desde entonces ya no es suficiente .
“Su riñón ya se hizo muy pequeño, ya no le sirven los riñones”, explica su esposa, “no tenemos el dinero, no tenemos los fondos para que a él lo operen”.
Martínez necesita un trasplante de riñones para sobrevivir. Y no es el único. Según un estudio publicado en febrero de 2018, alrededor de 6,500 inmigrantes indocumentados en todo el país sufren una enfermedad renal grave, pero en la mayoría de estados sólo pueden ser tratado con diálisis en caso de emergencia.
Y casi nunca pueden recibir un trasplante de riñón (se han registrado casos en California), que es una opción más saludable para el paciente y menos costosa para el erario público que la diálisis. Además, añade el estudio, los inmigrantes indocumentados donan sus órganos en mayor cantidad de la que reclaman un trasplante.
No existe una regulación legal que impida a estos inmigrantes recibir trasplantes; el problema es que, sin seguro médico disponible, el precio es casi siempre inasumible. Y el seguro médico público sólo cubre la diálisis ordinaria (no de emergencia) en estados como Nueva York, California , Illinois y Washington DC (en el resto, sólo se puede realizar en situaciones de emergencia, pese a ser un tratamiento que se precisa periódicamente), pero casi nunca cubre el trasplante.
En 2015, por ejemplo, una clínica de Nueva York se negó a trasplantarle a una mujer con una enfermedad renal en fase terminal el riñón que le iba a donar su propio marido, al enterarse de que ambos eran indocumentados y, por tanto, el seguro público Medicare no cubriría la intervención.
Según informó entonces el diario Daily News, un trasplante costaba 106,000 dólares , mientras que la diálisis (dos veces a la semana de forma indefinida) cuesta 72,000 dólares al año (para toda la vida).
Es por ello que, pese a pagar sus impuestos en Estados Unidos, algunos afectados viajan a México a realizar el trasplante, aunque allí el precio sigue siendo muy alto (40,000 dólares en 2011, según el diario The New York Times) y requieren de préstamos.
El congresista estatal Félix Ortiz ha presentado en mayo una propuesta de ley para que el seguro médico público Medicaid cubra los trasplantes a aquellos pacientes que lleven al menos dos años bajo diálisis. Según ha relatado a NY1, hay al menos seis inmigrantes indocumentados que lo requieren. La misma propuesta ha sido planteada ante el Senado estatal por el congresista Gustavo Rivera.

Texto completo: Masih Ur-Rahman Mubarez was working in Iran when his wife called him at 4 a.m. from their home in eastern Afghanistan. American and Afghan troops were inside the house, she said. It was a raid.

It was Sept. 23, 2018, and the next time Mr. Mubarez, 39, managed to get a phone call through, her phone was off.
Between 10:30 a.m. and noon, as Mr. Mubarez waited for word from his wife and seven children in Wardak Province, American aircraft dropped a GPS-guided bomb on his house, killing them and four other members of his family, according to Mr. Mubarez and the villagers who helped pull the 12 bodies from the rubble.
The American-led military mission in Afghanistan initially denied the bombing. Three months later, it confirmed the airstrike down to the exact coordinates of Mr. Mubarez's house in the hamlet of Mullah Hafiz. But the American command said that they had been receiving sniper fire from the building, and that "after review, it is our assessment that only combatants were killed."
The disparity between Mr. Mubarez's claim -- that 12 members of his family were killed -- and the matter-of-fact denial from the American military are emblematic of the nearly 18-year-old war, where civilians in virtually every corner of Afghanistan have been touched by violence and death at the hands of both sides.
After interviews with Mr. Mubarez and villagers at the scene, and an analysis of footage before and after the strike, an open-source investigation by The New York Times and The Bureau of Investigative Journalism determined that civilians were killed in an airstrike that used an American-made precision-guided bomb. In Afghanistan, only American forces use this type of weapon, The Times confirmed.
Mr. Mubarez is still searching for an explanation of why his family was killed, and for justice. When he asked the Taliban for answers, they denied the American claim that insurgent fighters had holed up in his home.
"When I went away my home was fine; when I returned it was destroyed, my children were in the grave," Mr. Mubarez said in an interview with The Times last month. "But I will not sit silent."
Mr. Mubarez had worked for four years as a teacher with a Swedish aid organization in his village before moving to Iran out of economic necessity, he said.
What happened that September morning in Mullah Hafiz, a Taliban-controlled village where cell towers are regularly shut down and outside communication is sporadic, is still not completely clear.
Abdul Rahman Mangal, a spokesman for the governor of Wardak Province at that time, denied that there had been any civilian deaths. Mr. Mangal told Pajhwok Afghan News that the operation had been conducted against a jail used by the Taliban, and that Taliban leadership were among the dead.
But Raz Mohammad Hemat Wazir, the district governor, said that the airstrike on Mr. Mubarez's house killed 12 civilians, including women and children. "The airstrike was carried out by American air power during a military raid in the village," he said.
Safiullah Rasooli, Mr. Mubarez's cousin, who was in Mullah Hafiz at the time of the strike, said that the night before there had been a series of airstrikes before Afghan commandos and Americans came to the village. Both Mr. Rasooli and Noor Khan, a village farmer, confirmed that the troops searched houses around the Taliban prison. Some villagers were held and then released, Mr. Khan said. Three people were arrested and taken to Kabul.
Mr. Rasooli said the suspects were bound and beaten, forced to huddle in a single room overnight in a nearby house.
The next morning, with Afghan and American troops still in the village, witnesses said, the Americans bombed Mr. Mubarez's house. Mr. Rasooli said that he looked up and saw several aircraft circling overhead.
Some villagers and Afghan government officials told Mr. Mubarez that Taliban fighters were firing at the aircraft and forces on the ground before the strike, some shooting from his house.
But both Mr. Khan and Mr. Rasooli said there was no gunfire from the village that morning. For people who live in a village under Taliban control, like Mullah Hafiz, confirming that there was gunfire would leave them open to Taliban retribution.
Bob Puritman, a spokesman for the American forces in Afghanistan, said that American and Afghan troops had been in a gun battle with the Taliban after the small force was airlifted into the area on the night of Sept. 22.
Hours before Mr. Mubarez's house was bombed, an American soldier had been wounded and evacuated from Mullah Hafiz village, he said, and American troops there reported they were taking "effective sniper fire" from Mr. Mubarez's house. The Americans then requested the airstrike, Mr. Puritman said. The American command offered no additional evidence that the Taliban had been in the house.
Mr. Mubarez, whose house is roughly 150 yards from the Taliban prison, said that the Taliban denied entering his house. A day after the strike, Zabihullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman, accused the Americans of killing 12 members of Mr. Mubarez's family, all civilians.
But Taliban fighters have long used civilians as shields against American airstrikes.
Several days after the bombing, Mr. Mubarez returned to Mullah Hafiz from Iran. He found his house destroyed, his children's bicycles twisted and mangled. On a nearby hill were the graves of his family: Amina, his wife; his four daughters, Anisa (14), Safia (12), Samina (7) and Fahima (5); his three sons, Mohammad Wiqad (10), Mohammad Ilyas (8) and Mohammad Fayaz (4); and their four teenage cousins.
"When I see my family's grave, that moment is the most painful moment for me," Mr. Mubarez said. "And when I see my ruined home, I don't have any energy to accept it."
A United Nations report released in April said airstrikes were the third-highest cause of civilian casualties in Afghanistan, killing 145 civilians and wounding 83 during the first quarter of the year, a 41 percent increase compared with the same quarter in 2018. The United States Air Force reported that American aircraft dropped 7,362 munitions in Afghanistan in 2018, almost twice as much as in 2017 and the most since the service started publicly keeping track in 2013.
Mr. Mubarez said he planned to rebuild his house, but for now he is living in Kabul. He has gone to the Afghan government, the United Nations and the Afghan Human Rights Commission looking for answers and for help.
"Whether there were Taliban or not, they have technology and modern equipment," Mr. Mubarez said about the American and Afghan military forces. "They can kill the enemy, but they only destroy my home. So far neither local authorities or the defense ministry say that they will investigate and take action. They just say that there was a mistake."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

U.N. expert: Assange suffering psychological torture

Texto completo: A United Nations expert on torture said Friday that an examination of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in a British prison showed an alarming deterioration in his mental and physical state, and he sharply rebuked Britain, Sweden and the United States for "ganging up" on Assange.
The U.N. special rapporteur on torture and ill treatment, Nils Melzer, said the examination in early May revealed that Assange's "capacity to focus and coordinate have been clearly affected" by his imprisonment.
"He was extremely jumpy and stressed," Melzer said in an interview. "It's difficult to have a structured conversation with him."
Furthermore, he said in a statement, Assange should not be extradited the United States. He said that the cumulative effects of his punishment can only be described as "psychological torture."
The U.N. official said he had sent his findings to the governments of Britain, Sweden and the United States, along with Ecuador. A spokesman for the British government said on Friday that the nation supported the important work of the special rapporteur's mandate but disagreed with some of his observations and would reply in due course. Ecuadorean, Swedish and American officials could not immediately be reached for comment Friday.
Assange, 47, hailed by many as a champion of transparency, has been sought by authorities in the three nations for a variety of charges. He jumped bail in Britain and sought refuge in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London as Sweden was in the middle of investigating a rape accusation against him, and the United States has accused him of helping an Army private to illegally download and leak classified information in 2010, much of it about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
After he lived in the Ecuadorean Embassy in the British capital for seven years, his relationship with his hosts soured over his arguments with the embassy's staff, his skateboarding indoors and what the nation's officials described as threats and leaks meant to embarrass Ecuador. The country's vice president, who blamed WikiLeaks, called the actions "despicable" and vowed to take action.
In April, the Ecuadorean government withdrew its protection, leading the British police to haul Assange out of the embassy and place him under arrest, and a British court to sentence him to 50 weeks in jail for jumping bail.
The United States is now seeking his extradition to face multiple counts of espionage for his part in the release of thousands of classified military and diplomatic cables in 2010. And he faces possible extradition to Sweden for the rape investigation.
WikiLeaks said on Thursday that Belmarsh prison authorities had moved Assange to its hospital wing after he experienced drastic weight loss and experienced other health problems.

Texto completo: We seem to have forgotten the Chicken Little fable. By the way, Chicken Little's real name is Henny Penny. Henny Penny freaks out and makes everyone believe the sky is falling." In the overdone distraction, they miss the real danger. Somehow and some way, I think it's happening in the Christian world.
I keep coming across articles that talk about the evangelical/church crisis. Christianity Today released a piece on this very topic. Even the New York Times published an article. Google it and watch the 18 pages of listings appear. There are books being written about it.
What seems to be the issue? Without question, we are in a post-Christian era where the Christian voice has gone hoarse. Maybe it has not actually gone hoarse, but without question it is falling on deaf ears. The days the church held sway are probably over. As one pastor I talk to on a regular basis said, "The horse is out of the barn, and he ain't coming back."
The cultural tsunami that many warned about has occurred. Basic morality has changed. But it has been changing long before now. I remember a college roommate of mine saying, "Whatever is accepted in secular society will be accepted in the church in approximately 10 years." I did not necessarily agree with him 40 years ago, but now that I have some miles under my feet, I think he was on to something.
We Christians like to think we change the culture. The opposite is probably more true. Culture tends to change us. Our culture of relativism leaves us to our own gyrations. They don't care. We resort to screaming to try to be heard, but they just turn up the volume in their own world.
We have not figured out how to impact that world even though God gave us a manual. Instead, here in 2019 we still expect the world to come to us. "Build it and they will come" died a long time ago.
Here we sit, shut out from spheres of influence, and along with that, few actually seek us out anymore. Church attendance is in decline. A recent statistic I heard was that 10 churches a week are closing their doors. Denominations are sliding downward. The sex abuse that laid hidden in all of Christianity has nailed the doors shut for many. Fewer pay any attention and fewer still are coming in the front door.
We are having issues with the back door being wide open as well. We have known for a long time we can't keep our own kids in the pews. It is making some wonder about the truth of gospel transformation. They say these trite prayers to ease a parent's conscience and they bolt when challenged by alternate philosophies and lifestyles.
We know that 85 percent of our own kids are leaving the faith. The biggest difference today? They are not coming back.
Nobody is listening. Fewer are coming and we can't seal the backdoor exodus. Sound the alarm! We are in a crisis!
Or are we?
We tend to apply business principles to the church and can't quite understand that it's not a business. Many think they are selling Jesus. Jesus can't be sold. He is not a commodity or a service to be rendered.
If we do apply business principles, there is probably a crisis. What happens when we are more worried about the little kingdom of God ("my" church) instead of the true, universal kingdom of God? We develop more gimmicks. We work hard to keep the masses happy. We think the sheep are more important than the shepherd. If all else fails, get a better salesperson.
Most articles and books I read on this issue are looking to place blame. Once blame is assessed, we can develop a formula to "fix it." Western culture likes to fix things. Blame the pastor, fire him. Blame the style of worship, change it. Blame the people, make them feel guilty and shameful. Blame the leadership, complain louder. Blame the church as a whole, start a new one. If all else fails, leave the church.
Isn't that what people do in the business world? Blame the boss, fire him. Blame the system, get a new one. Blame the customers, get critical. Blame the department heads, put the heat on. Blame the business, let it go bankrupt and start a new one. Blame the changing culture, retire early. Just fix it.
Trust me, there is a lot of blaming and a lot of fixing going on.
There is a biblical answer if anyone is interested. The blame? We have elevated ourselves at every turn. The answer? Return to him, as Jesus said, "with all your heart, all your mind and all your strength."
Failure to do so? That's the crisis, and it's personal.

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO - More than a dozen Democratic presidential hopefuls flocked to California on Saturday for the chance to make their cases to thousands of activists in the nation's largest liberal stronghold during a three-day gathering of the state party.
California's own Sen. Kamala Harris looked to make a show of force in the prime first speaking slot to kick off the day's main event, and her campaign even emblazoned the official convention lanyards with her name. But it was Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren who electrified the crowd the most among the early morning speakers, bringing the Democratic Party's most faithful voters to their feet repeatedly as she pledged bold action.
"Some say if we all just calm down, the Republicans will come to their senses," Warren said in a thinly veiled shot at former Vice President Joe Biden, who has expressed hope the GOP will have "an epiphany" after President Donald Trump is gone. "But our country is in a crisis. The time for small ideas is over."
Biden was the only major candidate not attending the weekend gathering, opting instead to campaign in Ohio.
A man described as an animal-rights activist disrupted a panel at which Harris, D-Calif., spoke, snatching a microphone out of the presidential candidate's hand as she looked on in surprise.
Harris stepped aside as the man tried to speak and organizers tried to stop him.
He was quickly restrained by several men.
"We need to begin impeachment proceedings and we need a new commander in chief!" she declared.
Acting Pentagon chief slams China's tech policy in speech
SINGAPORE - U.S. Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan on Saturday denounced China's efforts to steal technology from other nations and militarize man-made outposts in the South China Sea as a "tool kit of coercion," saying activities by Beijing the U.S. perceives as hostile must end.
In his first major speech on the international stage, Shanahan mixed sharp criticism of China and warnings of North Korea's "extraordinary" threat with vows that the U.S. will remain strongly committed to the Indo-Pacific region and is ready to invest billions of dollars in securing its stability.
While he didn't specifically name China in early parts of his speech, he made clear who his target was, making pointed references to Beijing's campaign to put advanced weapons systems on disputed islands in the region.
Justice Department preparing to investigate Google practices
WASHINGTON - The Justice Department is readying an investigation of Google's business practices and whether they violate antitrust law, according to news reports.
The search giant was fined a record $2.72 billion by European regulators in 2017 for abusing its dominance of the online search market. In the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission made an antitrust investigation of Google but closed it in 2013 without taking action.
Now the Justice Department has undertaken an antitrust probe of the company's search and other businesses, according to reports by The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and Bloomberg News. They cited unnamed people familiar with the matter.
Google didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
Officials: 79 people injured in blast at Russia explosives plant
MOSCOW - Russia's health ministry says 79 people have been injured in an explosion in a plant manufacturing TNT.
The blast took place Saturday in Dzerzhinsk, 250 miles east of Moscow. An investigation is underway but the cause of the blast has not been determined.
The ministry said 38 employees at the plant and 41 local residents sought treatment after the blast. It said 15 were hospitalized, one in serious condition.
The blast broke windows in about 180 residential buildings near the plant, the state news agency Tass reported.
Dmitry Krasnov, deputy governor of the region that includes Dzerzhinsk, said earlier on state TV that two people were missing in the blast, but later said that information had not been confirmed.
Judge orders captain arrested in Danube sinking
BUDAPEST, Hungary - A Hungarian judge on Saturday ordered the formal arrest of a captain whose Viking river cruise ship collided with a sightseeing boat on the Danube River, sinking the tourist boat and leaving seven South Koreans dead and 21 people missing.
Authorities said water levels in Budapest are expected to fall quickly in the coming days, helping efforts to salvage the wreckage that may still contain victims' bodies.
The judge ordered the 64-year-old Ukrainian captain of the Viking Sigyn cruise ship formally arrested for 30 days. He said the captain could be released on bail - subject to him wearing a tracking device and remaining in Budapest - but prosecutors are appealing that decision.
Divers so far have been unable to even approach the wreckage.
In speech to leaders, Saudi king slams Iranian attacks
MECCA, Saudi Arabia - Saudi Arabia's King Salman slammed Iran over recent attacks targeting the kingdom, describing the incidents on Saturday in a speech before Muslim leaders gathered in Mecca as "terrorist acts" that threaten global energy supplies.
It was the monarch's strongest words yet since tensions spiked in recent weeks between the two regional heavyweights.
Iran had a representative present at the 57-nation summit of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, but its top leadership did not attend.
The Islamic summit drew political figures and heads of state from countries spanning Africa, the Middle East and Asia.
They come with widely varying policies and priorities, but share a common reverence for the Al-Aqsa mosque in east Jerusalem.
Lunch with Buffett: An anonymous bidder has offered more than $4.5 million to have a private lunch with billionaire investor Warren Buffett, shattering the previous record of nearly $3.5 million. An online auction that raises money for the Glide Foundation's work to help the homeless in San Francisco ended Friday night with a winning bid of $4,567,888. It's the 20th year the Berkshire Hathaway CEO has participated in the pricey lunch auction, giving the winner the chance to talk with the renowned investor and philanthropist. Bidding starts at $25,000. Buffett has raised nearly $30 million for the charity over the years. The winning bidder and up to seven friends get to dine with Buffett.

Texto completo: African Americans historically prefer black candidates but feel even more strongly about winning, says scholar
Joe Biden has a past that threatens his prospects with black voters - from his long-ago stance against busing to his mismanagement of Anita Hill's testimony about Clarence Thomas to his onetime support of the 1994 crime bill. Now he's running for president in a crowded 2020 Democratic field that includes three black candidates, all of whom will need strong African American support to secure the party nomination.
So far, though, polling shows Biden with a dominant share of black Democrats' support. An average of two Quinnipiac polls of Democratic-leaning voters, one taken right after Biden declared his candidacy and another released in late May, found him well ahead of the other candidates, with 46 percent among African Americans nationally. Compare that with an average of 10 percent for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), 7 percent for Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and 11 percent for the three black candidates combined.
Biden certainly owes some of this early success to his tenure as Barack Obama's vice president. But a fuller explanation has to do with the politics of pragmatism. When it comes to presidential races, black voters, perhaps more than any other demographic, vote not for what might be gained but according to what might be lost.
Voters are generally risk-averse, preferring candidates they know over those who may be more exciting but unfamiliar. This holds particularly true for black voters: A study published last year in Public Opinion Quarterly noted that black voters are especially inclined to choose established candidates and efficiently assess contenders based on their perceived ability to preserve hard-won civil rights and racial equality gains.
This approach isn't new, but President Trump has intensified it. His disapproval rating among African Americans was 84 percent in a late-April YouGov poll, compared with only 9 percent approval. In a CNN/SSRS poll taken around the same time that grouped together all voters of color, 96 percent of nonwhite Democratic or Democratic-leaning voters reported that defeating Trump was extremely or very important to them in determining whom to support in the primary race; in a contemporaneous Quinnipiac poll, 61 percent of nonwhite Democrats said they believed that Biden had the best chance of doing so. Next best was Sanders, at 10 percent. If you were to go by Twitter or cable news coverage, you might conclude that minority communities are consumed by "identity politics." But voters of color, including black voters, are squarely focused on getting Trump out of office. Biden, for now, is the beneficiary.
This is unwelcome news for the rest of the primary field, especially Sens. Kamala Harris (Calif.) and Cory Booker (N.J.), who should otherwise have an inside track with black voters. In a 2006 paper, Yale University economist Ebonya Washington found that "Black voter turnout increases by 2.3 percentage points for every Black Democrat on the ballot." In a 2007 paper in the American Journal of Political Science, Tasha S. Philpot and Hanes Walton Jr. demonstrated that no bloc supports black female candidates like black female voters. And my own research has found that a candidate's race is especially meaningful to black men's vote choice. Political scientists have long known that black voters share a sense of "linked fate," a term used by University of Chicago political scientist Michael C. Dawson to describe "the degree to which African Americans believe that their own self-interests are linked to the interests of the race."
But when it comes to 2020, the politics of pragmatism make this descriptive representation less important to black voters than voting out the president. One African American voter told the New York Times, "Ms. Harris seems like a decent person, but I just don't think she'd have a chance" as a black female candidate, "and I don't want to throw away my vote." Rosemary Lawrence, a 75-year-old black woman in Charlotte, told The Washington Post she was impressed by Warren's policy agenda and admired Harris and Booker, but she thought Biden was best positioned to beat Trump. That sentiment isn't merely a desire to vote for a winner. (And clearly, it's not just black Democrats who see Biden as a good bet to unseat Trump.) It's the idea that too much is at stake in 2020 to indulge personal preference.
We've seen these politics before. Black Virginians favored keeping Gov. Ralph Northam (D) in office following his blackface controversy, rather than risking the possibility that the Republican speaker of the state House of Delegates would assume the office in his place. And at the end of 2007, Hillary Clinton had far more support among black primary voters than Obama did. Among black women, CBS News reported at the time, she held a 15-point lead, something Democratic strategist Donna Brazile attributed to familiarity and Clinton's perceived chance of victory. "Most black women simply believe Clinton can win," she said. The next year, after Obama won the Iowa caucuses and tied for New Hampshire delegates, the sense that his candidacy wasn't just aspirational - that he could actually snag the presidency - coincided with black support shifting away from Clinton and toward him.
The desire to win is understandable, given the intensity of the distrust, if not outright antipathy, toward Trump among black voters. His hand-waving at white nationalists; his nominations of judges with a history of championing racially discriminatory policies; his support for restrictive voting measures; his efforts to undermine Obamacare, a program that remains popular with African Americans; his hypocritical approach to criminal justice - backing sentencing reform while remaining indifferent to police misconduct - are some of the reasons African Americans want the president gone. A Quinnipiac poll taken last August found that 87 percent of black respondents did not think that Trump treats people of color with the same amount of respect as he treats white people, compared to only 7 percent who did. In particular, the insults the president has directed at a number of high-profile black women - Reps. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) and Frederica Wilson (D-Fla.), journalists Abby Phillip, Yamiche Alcindor and April Ryan - are interpreted not merely as Trump's failure to govern in their interest but also as a mark of his personal hostility.
Another strong sign for Biden is his showing among black voters 45 and over, who constituted a majority of the 2016 black vote. The black voter turnout rate reached historic levels in 2008 and again in 2012, helping to reelect Obama, even, according to Census data, as African Americans 25 to 44 voted at about the same rate, and those under 25 voted at a significantly lower rate than in earlier elections. Older voters also tend to be more conservative, and older black voters are more risk-averse, as evidenced by a 2008 study by University of Louisiana at Monroe political scientist Joshua Stockley showing that over-60 black voters were less likely to support Obama over Clinton.
None of this reflects poorly on other candidates' appeals to black voters. (For instance, Warren's policy-heavy pitch tackling racial disparities in housing, health care and education is starting to show positive results, especially with black female voters, as recently reported by the Associated Press.) And there's no guarantee that Biden will hold his advantage once the debates and primaries begin. Should his campaign falter, the politics of pragmatism will drive black voters to look elsewhere for the best opportunity to win the White House. Candidates who are putting in the work today position themselves to absorb any black support that Biden leaks.
But for now, a viable Biden campaign is likely to remain the practical choice for most black voters. Pragmatism may not inspire, excite or check all the boxes on voters' wish lists, but it may be what transforms Obama's second-in-command into the country's commander in chief.

Texto completo: President Trump has had a hard time finding people to fill the Federal Reserve's two empty spots because he's looking for something that doesn't exist: loyal Republicans who like low interest rates.
Now it is true, as the New York Times's Ross Douthat points out, that there are a handful of right-leaning economists who have consistently bucked the party line (or at least what it was during the Obama years) that lower rates will only set off a 1970s-style Great Inflation. Instead, they have quite accurately pointed out that the far greater risk is that higher rates will send us back into a 1930s-style Great Depression. The very fact that they've been willing to follow the evidence, though, and not what was in the party's best interests - such as, say, crippling the economy ahead of President Barack Obama's reelection - probably makes them suspect as far as Trump is concerned. After all, he has already appointed a few people just like this whom he now wants to fire, because of, yes, how independent-minded they've been. Specifically, they thought that the economy had improved enough last year that they could start raising rates a little bit faster.
The problem, then, is that loyal Republicans don't want low interest rates, and Republicans who do aren't loyal.
So how can Trump try to bend the Fed to his tweets when there aren't any obvious candidates to help him do that? Well, unless he nominates Jared Kushner or Mick Mulvaney - it seems as though they've had every other job in this administration - he really has two choices. Trump can either try to find political foot soldiers who haven't been wrong about monetary policy because they haven't said anything about it, or ones who have been very wrong about it but are now willing to say whatever it is they think he wants to hear.
Someone like Derek Kan, right now the undersecretary for policy at the Transportation Department, fits the mold of that first group. He's reportedly under consideration for one of the Fed jobs, and, on a certain level, it's almost not hard to see why. He would most likely sail through the confirmation process, as he already did for his current job - it doesn't hurt that he used to be the chief economist for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) - and he's generally well-regarded. He has even won praise from across the aisle for, in the words of Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), being both "smart" and "serious." The only drawback, as mentioned above, is that he doesn't really have any relevant experience. He hasn't published any papers on monetary policy or worked extensively in financial markets. Which is why, from Trump's point of view, it would be something of a gamble to nominate him. There's no way to know if Kan would support the kind of rate cuts that Trump wants. It would just be a bet that someone who has risen so far in the party wouldn't want to upset its leader.
The irony, then, is that Trump might have a better chance of getting what he wants by nominating someone who has been against rate cuts in the past. Someone who, as a result, feels as though they would have to go out of their way to let Trump know that they would go along with him now. Someone, in other words, who thinks how much stimulus the Fed gives the economy shouldn't be determined by how much it needs, but rather by . . . the price of gold? Actually, yes. There's always been a strain of thinking on the right, you see, that has wanted to repeal the 20th century: the taxes, the spending, and, above all, the monetary system. That's because they think that going back to the gold standard - which would force the Fed to raise rates whenever supply and demand meant that gold prices "wanted" to rise - would prevent the government from running the kind of deficits or creating the kind of inflation that they blame for kicking us out of the small-government Garden of Eden that they consider to have been the 1920s.
The important thing to understand, though, is that goldbugs tend to be more partisan than ideological. Sure, they would like to cut the deficit, but they won't complain if Republicans increase it by cutting taxes instead. And while they would really like for interest rates to be higher - they talk in fairly apocalyptic terms about the fate of the dollar if that doesn't happen - they won't object if a Republican president says they need to be lower ahead of an election. If anything, the opposite. That, at least, has been the case with Herman Cain, Stephen Moore and now Judy Shelton, all supporters of the gold standard who went from saying that the Fed needed to drastically raise rates under Obama to now saying that it should cut them under Trump.
This is why Trump keeps trying to appoint them - he's moved on to Shelton after personal problems derailed Cain's and Moore's candidacies - even though, at first glance, it would seem as though their policy preferences would be diametrically opposed to his own. Trump understands that if there aren't loyal Republicans who want low rates in general, then he needs to find loyal Republicans who are willing to say they want low rates when he does. The kind of person who, like Shelton, would go from saying that any level of inflation was "immoral," or that trying to create your own gold currency made you a "Rosa Parks of monetary policy," to now saying that the Fed should temporarily cut rates to zero.
And it turns out that there are just enough of those.

Texto completo: Here are some recipes for foods you might find at an iftar dinner like the one recently held in Lancaster.
The first two, for Turkish desserts, come from Cigdem Canleblebici, of Smoketown, who provided the desserts for the iftar dinner.
SEKERPARE (TURKISH
MOIST SEMOLINA COOKIES)
Ingredients:
For dough:
• 125 grams butter
• 2 eggs
• 1/2 cup oil
• 1/2 cup powdered sugar
• 1/2 cup semolina
• 1 teaspoon vanilla
• 1 teaspoon baking powder
• Orange zest
• 5 1/2 cups flour
For the top of dough:
• 1 egg yolk
• 1/2 teaspoon cocoa.
For syrup:
• 3 cups sugar
• 3 cups water
• 1/2 cup orange water
• Water with 2 drops lemon juice
Directions:
Combine dough ingredients, and shape them into flattened circles or ovals.
Brush the tops with a mix of the egg yolk and cocoa.
Bake the cookies at 375 F for 30 to 35 minutes.
Combine syrup ingredients and pour the cold syrup over the baked cookies while they’re still warm.
The following recipe uses kadayif, a sort of shredded phyllo dough that’s used in Turkish and other Middle Eastern desserts. It can be bought in specialty stores, online and even at Walmart.
CUSTARD WITH KADAYIF
Ingredients:
• 1 liter milk
• 1 cup sugar
• 1/3 cup cornstarch
• 1/3 cup flour
• 1 teaspoon vanilla
• 200 grams of cream
• 500 grams of kadayif
• 1/2 cup sugar
• 1/2 cup chopped walnuts
• 125 grams butter
Directions :
Cook the milk, sugar, cornstarch, flour and vanilla together. After you cook it, add cream later and mix it.
Roast dried kadayif, sugar, walnuts and butter until the kadayif is golden brown.
Place some roasted kadaif mixture in custard dishes, add a layer of custard and top it with the rest of the roasted kadayif.
Here’s a recipe for potato samosas that comes from The New York Times.
Both come from Murat Barin, owner of Turquoise Grill in San Antonio, Texas.
POTATO SAMOSAS
Makes about 20 small samosas
Total time: About 1 1/2 hours
Ingredients:
For the dough:
• 2 cups all-purpose flour
• 1/2 teaspoon salt
• 1 teaspoon ajwain or cumin seeds
• 1/4 cup vegetable oil
• 1/2 cup cold water
For the filling:
1 1/2 pounds russet potatoes, peeled, in 1-inch cubes
• 3 medium carrots, chopped, optional
• 3 tablespoons vegetable oil, plus about 3 cups more for frying
• 1 chopped onion, about 1 cup
• Salt and pepper
• 1 teaspoon cumin seeds
• 1 teaspoon black mustard seeds
• 1 teaspoon grated garlic
• 1 teaspoon grated ginger
• 2 Serrano chilies, finely chopped
• 1 teaspoon turmeric
• 1/2 teaspoon garam masala
• 3 tablespoons lemon juice
• 1 cup chopped cilantro, tender stems and leaves
Directions:
Make the dough: Put flour, salt and ajwain seeds in a medium bowl. Drizzle in oil and work into flour with fingers until mixture looks mealy. Add water gradually, stirring until a soft dough has formed. If dough seems too dry, add a tablespoon of water; if it seems wet, add a tablespoon of flour.
Knead for 1 minute and form into a ball. Wrap and set aside for 30 minutes.
Make the filling: Simmer the potatoes and carrots in well-salted water until tender, about 10 to 15 minutes. Drain and set aside to cool. Put 2 tablespoons oil in a deep, heavy skillet over medium-high heat.
Add onions, season with salt and pepper and cook, stirring, until softened and beginning to brown, 8 to 10 minutes.
Put 1 tablespoon oil in a very small skillet over medium heat. When hot, add cumin and mustard seeds. When seeds are fragrant and beginning to pop, stir in garlic, ginger, chilies, turmeric and garam masala. Let sizzle for a minute, then add skillet contents to onions.
Add reserved potatoes and carrots and stir well to coat. Check seasoning and adjust salt. Remove mixture to a bowl and let cool to room temperature.
When cool, add lemon juice and chopped cilantro. Mix well, smashing the potatoes a bit in the process.
Make the samosas. Portion the dough into 20 pieces, each weighing 1 1/2 ounces. Form each piece into a ball and place on a large plate. Cover with a damp napkin.
Roll each dough ball into a thin disc about 6 inches in diameter, as if rolling out pie dough. Cut each disc exactly in half, leaving 2 pieces with a straight side and a round side.
Form each half-disc into a cone by folding it over and pinching the straight sides together. Put 3 tablespoons filling in the opening on the round side, then pinch closed to make a stuffed triangle. Form the rest of dough balls into samosas.
Heat about 2 inches of oil in the bottom of wok over medium-high heat. Adjust heat to maintain the oil at 350 degrees.
Slip samosas 4 at a time into the hot oil and let fry on one side until golden, a minute or so, then flip and cook other side. Lift from oil and drain on paper towels.
Serve samosas hot or at room temperature, accompanied by your favorite chutney.
SUTLAC (TURKISH RICE PUDDING)
Makes 4-6 servings
Ingredients:
• 1/2 cup rice (short or long grain), rinsed and drained
• 1 cup water
• 2 cups whole milk
• 8-10 tablespoons sugar
• 1 heaping tablespoon cornstarch, dissolved in 3-4 tablespoons whole milk
• 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
• 1 egg yolk, whisked
• Sliced strawberries, for garnish
Directions:
Place drained rice and water in a heavy saucepan over medium heat. When water begins to simmer, cover and turn heat to medium-low.
Stir occasionally with a wooden spoon. Simmer until rice is tender (a small amount of water will still remain).
Add the milk and sugar while constantly stirring. Add cornstarch mixture and continue to stir constantly until pudding begins to simmer.
Once the cornstarch mixture is added, continue cooking long enough to dissipate the taste of raw cornstarch.
Add the vanilla extract, reduce heat to low and continue to cook for 2 to 3 more minutes.
Allow to cool for a few minutes. Mix approximately 1/2 cup of the rice pudding with the whisked egg yolk and set aside.
Divide remaining rice pudding among 4 large or 6 medium ovenproof individual serving dishes. Top each serving with some of the egg yolk/rice mixture.
Place the serving dishes on a cookie sheet and place under a broiler for 2 to 3 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove from broiler and allow to cool.
Refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours before serving.
Garnish with strawberries.

Texto completo: Is being unfit grounds to impeach a president? James Madison appears to have thought so when he said, during the debates of the Constitutional Convention of 1787, that a president could be removed for “incapacity, negligence or perfidy. ” Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, has put forward articles of impeachment on those very grounds, saying, “An unfit president can be impeached for those misdeeds that corrupt and harm society. ”
Last week, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, in essence, publicly implied that Trump is too mentally impaired to function as president. If that’s true, doesn’t she have a constitutional duty to act?
Trump arrived late to his meeting on infrastructure with Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer. He did not shake anyone’s hand, he did not sit down, but instead, according to Pelosi, he pounded the table and launched into a diatribe about her comments accusing him of having engaged "in a cover-up" before he stormed out of the room. The entire “meeting” lasted maybe more than three minutes.
Read more commentary:
Trump's cognitive deficits seem worse. We need to know if he has dementia: Psychologist
On Trump's mental fitness, the experts are silenced and the public's in the dark
What's going on with Donald Trump? Psychologist explains the president’s lies, reversals
“I walked into the room and I told Senator Schumer and Speaker Pelosi, 'I want to do infrastructure. … But, you know what? You can’t do it under these circumstances,” Trump said in the Rose Garden minutes later, announcing that he will refuse to carry out his legislative duties as president, unless Congress agrees to stop carrying out their duties of oversight. “You probably can’t go down two tracks. You can go down the investigation track and you can go down the investment track. ” (“You can’t investigate and legislate simultaneously — it just doesn’t work that way,” he later tweeted. )
Presumably, by definition, Trump is “unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office” — the 25th Amendment standard — if he simply refuses to do his job. Presidents aren’t allowed to go on strike.
Mental stability of Trump in question
The next day, Pelosi was still visibly shaken: “The president again stormed out. ” She said “again” because Trump previously did the same thing during a meeting with Pelosi and Schumer aimed at ending the government shutdown. Pelosi then slapped the dais with her hand and said, “Pound the table. Walk out the door. What? … Another temper tantrum. " Pelosi made it clear that this was far more serious than just bad behavior. “Again, I pray for the president of the United States. I wish that his family, or his administration or his staff would have an intervention. … Maybe he wants to take a leave of absence. ”
“Your prayer comments almost suggest you’re concerned about his well being,” said a reporter.
“I am. ”
News reports described Pelosi as “joking” about the 25th Amendment when reporters asked her whether she was suggesting a “statutory intervention. ”
“I thought you said statutory intervention. That would be good. Article 25. . . . That's a good idea. . . . I'll take it up with my caucus, not that they haven't been thinking about it," she said.
Indeed, members of the Democratic caucus have been thinking about it. After Pelosi’s remarks, Rep. Jackie Speier of California said, "I have felt for some time that the mental stability of the president of the United States is in question … and I suggested invoking the 25th Amendment,” citing mental health professionals who have diagnosed him as a "malignant narcissist," showing symptoms of anti-social behavior, paranoia and sadism.
This is not the first time Pelosi has confronted the issue of whether Trump is psychologically fit for office. In March, she told The Washington Post that Trump was “ethically unfit. Intellectually unfit. Curiosity-wise unfit. No, I don’t think he’s fit to be president of the United States. ” On April 10, she told The Associated Press that “in every way he is unfit to be the president of the United States. ”
Trump's diagnosis: mentally unfit for office
Many of us in the mental health community have been arguing for years that Trump should be removed because he is psychologically unfit. We posted a professional petition online stating that “in our professional judgment … Donald Trump manifests a serious mental illness that renders him psychologically incapable of competently discharging the duties of president of the United States. ” It garnered over 70,000 signatures and formed a professional organization, Duty To Warn, dedicated solely to this issue and has held rallies across the country.
Most recently, "Dangerous Case" editor Bandy Lee and a group of colleagues issued a mental health analysis of the Mueller report in which they concluded “there is compelling medical evidence” that Trump “lacks the capacity to serve as president. ” He manifests “impaired capacity to make responsible decisions free of impulsivity,” as well as an "inability to consider consequences before taking action, detachment from reality, paranoid reactions, creation of dangerous conditions, and cognitive and memory difficulties. "
While some have tried to dismiss these professional assessments as partisan, that charge is belied by the members of Trump’s own administration, who have privately mused about the 25th Amendment. "Given the instability many witnessed, there were early whispers within the Cabinet of invoking the 25th Amendment,” wrote the anonymous author of a famed New York Times op-ed. White House staff frequently texted “#TFA” among themselves whenever Trump “did something that was just so insane, and so crazy, and unhinged,” Omarosa Manigault Newman told MSNBC. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, according to reports, admitted that he proposed invoking the 25th Amendment, though he later claimed (unconvincingly it seems to us) to have been joking.
However, the Republican Cabinet will never invoke the 25th, so where does that leave Democrats?
After Trump's temper tantrum in the White House last week, Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland said, “Most of us on the Judiciary Committee have just thrown up our hands” and said “let’s go ahead and launch an impeachment inquiry. ”
Impeach Trump to protect office of president
In the same interview on NBC News, he said, “Today the 25th Amendment has come resurging back into focus because of these extraordinary events that took place in the White House. . . . Speaker Pelosi showed her compassionate side when she said there should be a family intervention. Unfortunately, some conditions are way beyond the capacity of a family intervention to address. This might be far more serious. "
Citing Lee’s mental health analysis of the Mueller report, Raskin said, “The president is failing at every level of basic mental and cognitive health. He cannot take in information successfully. He cannot process information successfully. He cannot engage in decision-making without bias, distortion, impulsivity, impetuosity, and he cannot keep himself and others free from danger. ”
Though Raskin did not directly cite Trump’s lack of mental fitness as the constitutional ground for opening an impeachment inquiry, the context suggests that it was certainly on his mind, and adds to the urgency to the need for such an inquiry, if nothing else. Clearly Congress has an obligation, as James Madison said, to protect the nation against a chief executive who has demonstrated “incapacity. ”
Pelosi has thus far resisted calls for impeachment on the grounds that it would arouse the ire of Trump’s base going into the 2020 election. But she seems to ignore the opposite risk: Underreacting desensitizes us to the dangerous severity of Trump’s dysfunction, normalizing the abnormal.

The invasion of America is not fake

Texto completo: The Democrats running the House of Representatives have gone insane — and they prove it every day.
Despite the conclusions of the Mueller Report, Nancy Pelosi and her Deranged Democrat underlings in the House have not given up their fight to depose President Trump.
They have six kangaroo committees in the House subpoenaing anyone who ever played golf with the president and looking everywhere they can for whatever financial or personal dirt they can find to use against him and his administration.
The Mad House Democrats don't care what irresponsible charges they make.
When it comes to Trump, all's fair in hate and war.
Meanwhile, while they make fools of themselves and waste time trying to over-ride the Mueller Report, the Deranged Democrats refuse to do a single thing about the invasion of migrants on our southern border.
No Democrat would be caught dead calling it "an invasion." Neither would any journalist or pundit employed by CNN, MSNBC, the New York Times or the Washington Post.
But when you have thousands and thousands of Central American asylum seekers over-running our border every day and overwhelming our ability to process and properly care for their families, it's an invasion.
Overcrowding is so bad now at the Texas border that the Border Patrol has had to fly or bus migrant families to processing centers in towns like Santa Fe, Denver, San Diego, San Bernardino and Murrieta, a city of about 100,000 between LA and San Diego.
No one is quite sure where they go after they are processed, but it could be anywhere. And they have little or no money, no food, no place to stay — just a slip of paper telling them to show up at their asylum hearing two years from now.
When will Democrats in Congress wake up and acknowledge this invasion is real? Never. They don't give a you-know-what.
There's nothing planned.
No Democrat is talking seriously about how to fix our broken immigration system — which hasn't been addressed for 33 years by either party in Congress.
Democrats pretend the invasion is not happening and the liberal media either pretend along with them or mock the president and Republicans who call it a national emergency.
The mainstream liberal media are especially at fault because they have done such a biased, half-butted job of covering the migrant invasion.
They've shown us every misery suffered by the poor migrants after they get to American soil.
And they've made sure the whole country knows the details about the separated families and the tragic deaths of six kids in U.S. custody — all of which, of course, are entirely the fault of a man named Trump.
But the mainstream media is shameful.
They have consistently underplayed the scope of the invasion problem, its economic and social costs, its causes (bad immigration laws and a chicken Congress) and ignored its many other victims — the American ones.
The migrant invasion has hurt the overworked border patrol officers, the people and property owners in the towns at the border, American taxpayers and the poorest citizens of the USA whose unskilled jobs are most likely to be taken by migrants.
Now we have cities and towns far from the border becoming the latest victims of Washington's failure to fix immigration.
It's their citizens who are going to have to pay for a lot of the food, housing, policing, education and healthcare of the migrants.
The saddest part is that this politically created mess on our border is not going to change.
Congress isn't going to do anything and it won't let Trump do anything.
It should be up to the public to clean out the bums in the House and Senate, but voters won't do anything because though most of them think Congress is a cesspool of incompetent cowards they also think their home congressperson is just great.
Since the invasion of migrants from Central America is not going to stop anytime soon, you might as well go down to your town square or bus station and put up a "Welcome to America" sign.
Just make sure you write it in two languages.
