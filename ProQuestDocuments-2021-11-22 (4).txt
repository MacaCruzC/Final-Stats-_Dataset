Texto completo: For the last column I'll write in 2019, I think back to the first column I wrote in 2019.
The headline referenced a quote from forward Brayden Schenn: "Blues are 'slumping together.'"
What a demoralizing line. Slumping together. As if not just some of the guys were in a slump -- everyone was playing so poorly, the team's mediocrity was unified.
But Schenn also had another quote in that column: "You look at our roster, we should be at the top of the league, not the bottom."
Sure enough, that roster ended that season at the top of the league -- and engraved on the Stanley Cup.
It was the "David Freese Game" of seasons. The coolest thing to happen to St. Louis sports, spread out across six months: Binnington and the winning streak, Gloria and Laila, the Jets and the Sharks, Schwartz's hat trick and the hand-pass response, Parayko's "KO" of Bishop and Maroon's goal past Bishop, Gunnarsson's Game 2 winner and Pietrangelo's Game 7 crusher; no one touching the Campbell Bowl and the whole city touching the Stanley Cup.
"When I'm reading an article and it says 'the Stanley Cup champion St. Louis Blues,' I'm still a little taken aback," said Tom Stillman, chairman of the Stanley Cup champion St. Louis Blues. "It still hits me every time. . . . And seeing the reaction of Blues fans just shows what kind of emotional bond so many people have with the St. Louis Blues franchise -- and with their own city and community. Because I think it was so intertwined, the feeling of pride with St. Louis, along with the pride in their team."
I was aghast the other day when the New York Times, listing its 12 "Sports Moments 2019," omitted the Blues. That's like naming the top-12 French chicken dishes and omitting cordon bleu.
Even if the 2018-19 Blues had been in first place all year and won the Cup, it still would have been an epic sports story, considering the franchise never had won the Cup -- and hadn't even played in the Final since 1970. Then consider that in January, the Blues has the fewest points in the entire NHL.
They put in their fourth-string goalie, who became the NHL's best goalie. St. Louis won the second round of the playoffs on a double-overtime goal in St. Louis by a native of St. Louis. And the Blues went on to win Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Final in Boston. Before the Blues, no team from the four major North American sports leagues won a title after occupying last place overall after one-quarter or more of the season's games (since 1967-68).
Eh, maybe they'll crack the Times' list next year.
No, but that's the thing -- maybe they actually will. The Blues enter Tuesday as the top team in the Western Conference and winners of eight straight games. While we mention how amazing the first six months of 2019 were for the Blues, the next six also have been quite a fun ride. The Blues made a trade for three-time All-Star Justin Faulk (and have him for seven seasons), and on Monday, three other Blues were named All-Stars.
Oh, and the team and the city of St. Louis will host All-Star weekend in January. The Blues are persistent and consistent -- 13-4-3 at home, 13-4-3 on the road. The power play has been restored, as has Jake Allen. In 40 games played, David Perron has a team-high 40 points.
"Once you get a taste of winning, it's so addictive," Blues budding star Robert Thomas said. "You get that feeling, you get that sense in the room between guys -- you want to do it again. We had the best couple weeks of our lives after we won, so it's definitely something that motivates you to want to do it again. We obviously lost a couple big parts of our team to injuries, but being motivated (to repeat) kick-started our year."
And in 2019, the Blues opened their sparkling new practice facility, the Centene Community Ice Center. At Monday's practice, there was a standing- room only crowd. Really. It was quite the scene -- the stands were packed with fans, and a horseshoe of fans, a couple people deep, stood around one end of the rink. A line snaked at the door. It was easier to get the interview on the phone with Stillman than it was to get one with the security guard at the metal detector.
Finally, there was a quick break in the fan flow.
"I'm definitely surprised by this being just a practice and seeing hundreds of fans come through and to be some pumped and so excited," security guard Aurdie Murphy said. "It tells you about the love that people have for the team here. And the city."
And Stillman epitomizes all of it -- a hockey fan who became an owner and the team's chairman. On Christmas morning, he unwrapped a gift from his wife. It was a personalized photo album of the family's Cup run memories.
Stillman's cup runneth over with Cup memories. The parade and the parties, the White House and his own house.
"Right after it was engraved, the Keepers of the Cup brought it over to the house at about 9 p.m.," Stillman shared Monday. "They carried it through the front door. Put it on top of a chest on the front hall, and there it was. That was one of the most striking occurrences of the whole thing -- to see this entire group engraved on the Stanley Cup forever."
From "slumping together" to "the Stanley Cup forever."
What a year.

Texto completo: If your only sense of the state of our unions is drawn from the pop culture and the prestige press, you probably think marriage in America is on the ropes. The critically-acclaimed new movie, "Marriage Story," described by its costar Adam Driver as a "love story about divorce," provides viewers with an intimate and raw glimpse into the demise of a marriage in New York City and Hollywood. The bestselling new novel from Taffy Brodesser-Akner, "Fleishman Is in Trouble," tells a similarly bleak marriage story about another bitter divorce unfolding in New York between a doctor and a talent agent.
Pop cultural offerings like these give the impression that many marriages are messy and miserable, and the descent into divorce is rampant.
Or take the messages about marriage we get from the media. The New York Times recently ran an op-ed, "Beyond Marriage," from an eminent family scholar suggesting that marriage is "disappearing." Elsewhere, Brookings Institution fellow Isabel Sawhill warns, "marriage is in trouble and, however desirable, will be difficult to restore."
But the story of the death of marriage, told in popular and elite venues, has been greatly exaggerated, to paraphrase Mark Twain. While movies like "Marriage Story" and op-eds do their part to perpetuate the cultural myths of widespread divorce and the collapse of the institution of marriage, the reality is that there is good news to report about the state of our unions and state of the American family. If we look at three key trends over the last decade in the United States, there are bright spots on the family horizon.
1. Divorce is on the rocks
First, divorce is down. In fact, the divorce rate has been falling since it peaked around 1980, at the height of the divorce revolution. According to our analysis, the divorce rate has fallen by nearly 25% over the last decade to the point where there are about 15 divorces per 1,000 married people today -- about the same rate as in 1970. And scholars predict that the divorce rate will continue to fall.
Surveys tell us that Americans are less tolerant of divorce today. That's in large part because, as family scholar Richard Reeves put it, "Modern marriage is not principally about money, sex, or status. It's about children." Today's married couples seem to invest more in staying together, unlike the Boomers who were obsessed with their own fulfillment in the '70s, offering their children a better shot a more stable family life and future.
2. Children following marriage
Second, nonmarital childbearing is down. As Lyman Stone explained at the Institute for Family Studies, though the reasons for the decline are complex, "we are actually approaching a decade of falling births to unmarried women."
The rate of nonmarital childbearing has fallen from 41% in 2009 to 39.6% in 2018. We think what has happened, in part, is that young adults in America have become more cautious in the wake of the Great Recession about forming families and, hence, are less likely to leap into parenthood without a ring on their finger.
3. Two-parent households
And, finally, the share of children being raised in intact, married families is ticking upwards. Although family instability and single parenthood are still too high, less divorce and fewer babies born out of wedlock mean more stable, married families in America. Since bottoming out in 2014, we've seen a small increase in the share of children being raised by their own married parents. Specifically, the share of children being raised in intact, married families bottomed out at 61.8% in 2014 and has risen to 62.6% in 2019, according to our analysis of Census data. We expect this number to keep heading upward in the coming years.
What does all this mean for American children? Children raised by their married parents enjoy a host of life-long benefits compared to children born into other family forms, including more financial stability, greater physical safety, more involved fathers, and greater educational, social and psychological outcomes.
And, as we have seen, those who are privileged to be born into married-parent families today are less likely than children in the past few decades to witness their parents' divorce, sparing children the grief that often follows the death of their parents' marriage.
All of this is good news for our children, good news that has been obscured in recent pop cultural and media depictions of marriage in America. It should encourage us to do a better job of promoting the facts about the benefits of marriage to the rising generation, even as we try to help them form stronger marital bonds.
Although the state of our unions isn't as strong as it could be, for our kids at least, marriage is getting stronger -- and this is news that should be widely heralded as we head into the new decade, especially given that the science tells us that intact marriage is the gold standard when it comes to the welfare of our kids.

Texto completo: He was a suspect in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics bombing, and is now the subject of Clint Eastwood's new film. A look back on our reporting to understand the story.
A special edition of The Atlanta Journal hit newsstands on July 30, 1996, a pivotal headline splashed across the front page: "F.B.I. Suspects 'Hero' Guard May Have Planted Bomb."
It was three days after a lethal explosion killed one woman and injured more than 100 people at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta's Centennial Olympic Park. The story would change everything for Richard A. Jewell, the security guard in question -- even long after his name was cleared.
Before the report came out in the paper, now named The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, officials had used eyewitness accounts to compile a sketch of a man believed to have planted the pipe bomb in the park. But the F.B.I. wouldn't release the sketch, and it wouldn't yet name any suspects. A photo of a man near the blast site was too grainy for officials to make out any facial features.
Spectators in Atlanta and around the world, unnerved by violence at an event that celebrates global unity, were anxious for answers. Enter Jewell -- who seemed to fit the bill of a lone wolf, as some news organizations began to speculate. Maybe he wanted to play hero for 15 minutes. (Never mind the lack of evidence.)
Jewell's story is chronicled -- and perhaps a bit dramatized -- in "Richard Jewell," Clint Eastwood's latest directorial work, now in theaters. Here's how the real events played out in the pages of The New York Times.
Jewell Was Hailed as a Hero ...
Jewell was first referenced in The Times on July 28, 1996 -- not by name, but as "an AT&T security guard," in the paper's initial story on the explosion. AT&T had hired Jewell and others through a security firm to keep an eye on its five-story sound and light tower in Centennial Olympic Park.
Jewell, then 33, had noticed an abandoned backpack under a bench near the tower and alerted an agent with the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. Together, they helped clear 75 to 100 people away from the area, the agent told The Times. The pipe bomb, inside the bag, exploded minutes later. Alice S. Hawthorne, a spectator from Albany, Ga., died in the blast; Melih Uzunyol, a Turkish cameraman running to cover the explosion, died of a heart attack soon after.
"The only thing I wish we could have done is got everybody out of the area," Jewell said in an interview on CNN later that day. "I feel for the victims and their families and, I mean, it's the Olympics. It's supposed to be a time of joy for the world, and it's a very, very bad thing."
... Then Became a Suspect
Jewell's life turned upside down after The Journal named him as the focus of the F.B.I.'s investigation. While the newspaper did not cite its sources for this information, Eastwood's movie depicts a female reporter offering sex to an F.B.I. agent in exchange for it.
Government officials and news organizations descended on the apartment Jewell shared with his mother. Dozens of F.B.I. agents scoured the home and towed away Jewell's truck. In an apartment complex overlooking his building, four stations -- ABC, CBS, CNN and NBC -- paid a tenant $ 1,000 a day to set up a command post in her unit.
Yet he was never charged. Inside, Jewell watched TV. He read. He played video games. He couldn't go outside -- not without setting off a high-speed car chase of government vehicles and media vans, anyway.
But beyond his walls, in the news, his case seemed to worsen. Details that appeared to support his guilt began to emerge: The Journal article quoted acquaintances of Jewell's, who recalled him owning a backpack similar to the one that held the bomb. Officials at Piedmont College, a small Georgia school where Jewell had been a security guard, had called the F.B.I. the day of the explosion with concerns that Jewell was "overly zealous."
If The Times's reporting showed restraint, focusing more on the local frenzy than the man himself, it was thanks to hard-won lessons in sourcing, Max Frankel wrote in the paper's magazine. "The Times had learned from its own sad transgressions over the years that whispered accusations against named individuals must not be trusted."
The Wrong Man, and the Legal Aftermath
Three months later, in a letter to one of Jewell's lawyers, the Justice Department made it official: Richard Jewell wasn't the man they were looking for.
It would take time for officials to track down the right one: Eric Robert Rudolph, an anti-abortion militant who, in 1998, was linked to other bombings, but evaded police for years. In 2005, he pleaded guilty to the bombings and received four life sentences.
The Justice Department admitted some fault in how federal agents handled the investigation into Jewell -- specifically an early interview in which officials intentionally misled Jewell to ask him questions about the bombing. Their interrogation, agents told him, would be used for a training video.
In a memo first reported by The Journal and later confirmed by The Times, the department said that the deceptive tactics used for the interview constituted "a major error in judgment" from the F.B.I.
Jewell also sought legal action for the way he was characterized in the press, winning settlements from CNN and NBC. His libel suit against the company that owned The Journal lingered in the courts for years before the final claim was dismissed.
'A Man Cleared, but Not His Name'
"He feels the stares of strangers in restaurants," The Times's correspondent Kevin Sack wrote one year after the bombing, "knowing they still wonder if he is the one."
It had been nine months since the Justice Department cleared Jewell of any involvement. Still, the constant media attention he received at the height of the investigation had turned him into a public figure. Children asked for autographs. A woman he took on a date published a written account of the evening in a city magazine.
"I'm a lot more cynical than I used to be," Jewell said in Sack's story. "I'm not as trusting as I once was. And I don't think I'm as outgoing as I used to be."
Jewell died in 2007 at his home in Woodbury, Ga., after months of serious medical problems following a diabetes diagnosis earlier that year. He was 44.
In the headline of his Times obituary, Jewell was remembered how people knew him in those first days after the explosion: "Hero of Atlanta Attack."

Texto completo: America is always in a state of flux. The country is an eternal experiment, aiming at evolution, betting on its own betterment.
It has its dark sides — racism, sexism, xenophobia, homophobia — but it clings to the idea, the fairy tale, that change and progress are not only possible, but they are intrinsic to the dream that is this nation.
And, every so often, a period arises in which some of that dream manifests and change is clear and indisputable, a leap forward for a people.
The 2010s were just such a decade.
To be sure, there were some sobering and surprising developments.
Occupy Wall Street, Black Lives Matter, the #MeToo movement, the Women’s March, March For Our Lives and climate activists illustrated an awakening and rebirth of protest movements in this country, against the intransigence of governments hopelessly linked to powerful industries and the gross imbalances of power between races and gender, and gross abuses of power by the state.
Left and right political ideological fundamentalism found their footholds. The right pushed to an extreme of white nationalist insularity fed by a consuming fear of white displacement and religious diminution. The left fought against the placating, middle of the road, quasi-liberalism that flirted too frequently with big business and big money, that spoke more frequently about the middle class than the poor, that rivaled the right in its zeal to be tough on crime at the expense of minority citizens.
Mass shootings have become part of the American motif. Republicans and the gun lobby have resisted efforts to address the epidemic of gun violence in this country, so the carnage has become an ambient terror in our society. The mass shootings have not only increased in frequency, they have become more deadly.
In September, The Los Angeles Times analyzed more than 50 years of mass shootings and found:
“Twenty percent of the 164 cases in our database occurred in the last five years. More than half of the shootings have occurred since 2000 and 33% since 2010. The deadliest years yet were 2017 and 2018, and this year is shaping up to rival them, with at least 60 killed in mass shootings, 38 of them in the last five weeks.”
Social media took a central position in daily life, connecting people, inspiring activism and gathering consensus on social issues. But, it also has begun to pose a very real threat to our democracy, as the Russian interference in the 2016 election revealed. The tech companies were too easily used as vessels for disinformation and they had too few safeguards to prevent it.
But perhaps no subjects inspired a more dramatic change in the way Americans considered basic human behaviors as the huge swings on the acceptance of LGBTQ people and our country’s relationship to drugs.
In 2010, for the first time, American’s acceptance of “gay relations” crossed the 50% mark. Now that number is well into the 70s. Over the same period, acceptance of same-sex marriage went from the 40s to the 60s. Acceptance of gay adoption went from below 50% to above 70%t.
Being gay became mainstream. And, this reaches further than just gays and lesbian. There is a new visibility for trans people, drag and fluidity. A YouGov poll asked Americans to place themselves on the Kinsey scale, “where 0 is completely heterosexual and 6 is completely homosexual.” While only 5% rated themselves as completely gay, 20%t rated themselves somewhere between completely gay and completely straight.
That is not to say that homophobia disappeared, or that there isn’t a tremendous amount of work still to be done around the issues of bullying, discrimination, safety and sexual health. But it is to say that the American society took a quantum leap forward in just a few years on these issues.
The other issue is our view of drug usage.
This one is very much driven by racial considerations. When drug addiction was primarily seen as an inner-city problem plaguing black and brown communities, policymakers and the public at large rushed to impose harmful penalties. Now that white people in the suburbs and rural areas are disproportionately affected, the language and policies have shifted from pathological criminality to sympathetic victimization.
Drug overdoses involving heroin skyrocketed, with white people outpacing all others. This in part led to a sharp increase in mortality among white, less educated Americans. As CBS put it, “In 1999, the mortality rate for this demographic was about 30% lower than those of African Americans. But by 2015, their mortality rate had eclipsed that of blacks by 30%.”
Furthermore, the legalization of marijuana has seen a surge in support. In October 2010, 46% of Americans believed that the drug should be legal, according to the Pew Research Center. Now that number is 67%. A number of states have legalized recreational usage, and it has become a big business. Even John Boehner, the former speaker of the House, has become a lobbyist for the cannabis industry.
On these two major issues, this is the decade that America changed its mind.

Texto completo: Una nueva investigación periodística revela que altos cargos de la administración Trump expresaron su inquietud ante la retención de la ayuda militar a Ucrania hasta que el país del este de Europa anunciara investigaciones en contra de rivales políticos del presidente estadounidense.
El New York Times publicó el pasado domingo una descripción detallada de la consternación que habían mostrado los funcionarios que tenían que implementar las órdenes que finalmente llevaron a Trump a un juicio político este mes de diciembre.
El reportaje del Times muestra a una administración dividida entre los cargos que apoyaban la decisión de Trump de detener la ayuda y quienes cuestionaban la legalidad, moralidad y las posibles consecuencias de las intensiones del presidente.
La investigación asegura que el secretario de Defensa, Mark Esper; el de Estado, Mike Pompeo y el exasesor de seguridad nacional, John Bolton intentaron sin éxito convencer a Trump de emitir la ayuda durante una conversación que tuvieron en la oficina oval.
“Esto es por el interés del país”, diría Bolton mientras Esper trataba de hacer ver a Trump los beneficios que traería a Estados Unidos una Ucrania fuerte. Pero ninguno de los argumentos movieron un ápice la postura del presidente , que siguió ordenando la retención de la ayuda hasta que, en septiembre, cuando saltaron las alarmas de que un informante secreto había revelado el escándalo.
El Times también halló que Mick Mulvaney, jefe de gabinete y de la oficina de Administración y Presupuesto, coordinó a funcionarios para detener la ayuda. Esos mismos funcionarios se encargaron primero de negar los hechos y de culpar a otros de la administración cuando se intensificó el escrutinio en su contra.

Real war on Christmas is Christian persecution

Texto completo: America's "War on Christmas" has been raging for over a decade, inciting controversies over nativity scenes, Christmas lights, holiday cards and even Starbucks cups. Everyone from The New York Times to Time has commented on the so-called war, with one side claiming that Christianity itself is at risk, and the other side dismissing the outrage as "histrionics."
There may or may not be a war on Christmas in America. But there certainly is one in other parts of the world, and it is these wars that should be getting our attention. Open Doors USA calls persecution of Christians "one of the biggest human rights issues of this era," citing instances of violence, imprisonment and murder in countries around the world. According to Open Doors, in 2018 over 245 million Christians were living in places where they experienced high levels of persecution.
A report published this year by the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) found that Christians in Burma, the Central African Republic, China, Eritrea, Iran, Nigeria, North Korea, Pakistan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Vietnam face the highest levels of persecution. According to a USCIRF commissioner, "Christians are the most persecuted religious group in the world," and that persecution is only intensifying.
What does that persecution look like? It looks like government oppression, mob attacks and churches being burned. It looks like rape and attacks on the elderly. It looks like 11 Christians being killed every day for their faith.
In Syria, where over 800,000 people are Christians, Christian villages have been "hollowed out" by ISIS, according to The New York Times. Most historic churches have been demolished or claimed by Islamic groups. Last September, six Christian children were killed in a bomb attack on a Christian village.
Today, with the recent U.S. decision to withdraw most troops from Syria, 150,000 Christians in Northeast Syria are in danger, along with those of many other faiths, according to Lauren Homer, an attorney with Law and Liberty International. Hundreds have already died as their villages have been bombed.
At the same time, there is little hope of resettlement as refugees, especially in the U.S. In the past several years, there has been a sharp decline in the resettlement of Christian refugees, particularly from countries where Christians face extreme persecution. From FY2016 to FY2019, the number of Christian refugees from Iran has plummeted 95.4%; 94.2% fewer Christians have been resettled from Iraq; and the same group from Pakistan has dropped 74.1%.
And now, a Christian pastor seeking asylum in the U.S. is being sent back across the border under the White House's remain-in-Mexico policy. Last week, I met Douglas Oviedo, a Honduran youth pastor who was so effective at drawing young people to Jesus – and away from gangs – that the gangs threatened his life, compelling him to flee his country. After 11 months of waiting in Mexico, Pastor Douglas was granted asylum by a U.S. immigration judge. But he is still not in the clear, because our government has inextricably appealed his case, such that Pastor Douglas could be deported back into the hands of Honduran gangs rather than be allowed to stay in the U.S. and bring his wife and small children.
While I appreciate that President Donald Trump has affirmed his support for Christmas greetings, a much more impactful gesture would be fulfilling his pledge to facilitate the resettlement of persecuted Christian refugees. This would also mean rolling back changes to asylum policy that threaten to deport pastors and others back to the Central American gangs seeking to harm them.
It's okay that not everyone in America shares the same faith; in fact, the religious freedom that allows each person to choose for themselves how (or if) to believe is a core American value. My own Christian faith compels me to welcome refugees and asylum seekers whether persecuted for their faith – Christianity or any other – or for their ethnicity, political opinion or other reasons. I challenge "War on Christmas" warriors to keep their focus on the real sufferers this Christmas.
As we reflect upon the nativity story, let's not forget this detail from the Bible: Just after the three wise men brought their gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh, Jesus himself was carried by Joseph and Mary across a border to Egypt, fleeing the genocidal persecution of King Herod. We can best honor a refugee Savior this Christmas by remembering brothers and sisters persecuted by the Herods of today and by insisting that our government resume its role as a safe haven for persecuted Christians and others fleeing persecution.

Texto completo: The New York Times reached you in more ways than ever in 2019: through a global digital report, one of the most downloaded podcasts, a weekly television program and, as has been true since its founding in 1851, a newspaper that remains dedicated to helping people understand the world. This section is both a reflection of what The Times delivered this year and a thank-you for helping make our work possible. The Times has a team of 1,700 journalists, including those based in 15 bureaus in the United States and 31 more around the world. Members of our staff speak more than 55 languages. We have lawyers covering law, doctors covering health, retired Marines covering war, and economists and M.B.A. recipients covering business. As the essay below illustrates, The Times touches many of our readers' lives, and as the pages that follow show, our reporting reaches into all corners of life, at home and in places few of us will ever travel. More opportunities and challenges await our journalists in 2020, but this is a chance to pause and, on behalf of everyone at The Times, to thank you and wish you a happy New Year. DEAN BAQUET, EXECUTIVE EDITOR
IMAGES THAT CONJURE MEMORIES
We've published more than 1,000 photos since the Past Tense project started last November. Some had been sitting in filing cabinets for more than a century, never before exposed to the public eye. Others had appeared in the pages of The New York Times decades ago and then largely faded from memory. People have reacted to these images with surprise, delight, shock and curiosity -- and sometimes with recognition. Some of the photos brought back cherished memories of the first flushes of romance or of the wild nights of youth. Others captured departed family members or pets. Most delightful of all were the notes we received that allowed us to finally put a name to a previously anonymous face in our archives, decades after one of our photographers first captured it.
1. The art dealer Marianne Boesky was delighted to discover this photo that our photographer Sara Krulwich took of her and her dearly departed pooch, featured in our story about dogs back in February. "Woke up to this throw back pic from 1993!" she wrote on Instagram. "Thank you New York Times and my beautiful Mingus, RIP."
2. Richard Sassin was "truly overwhelmed" to discover this Lonnie Schlein photo of him dancing at Studio 54 in 1979 with Sara Jones, which appeared in our special section "Perpetual Motion" in April. "My Sundays are often spent reading The Times from cover to cover and I hadn't gotten to the Dance section when a friend called to tell me to open to a certain page," Mr. Sassin said. "And there we were in our glory years trying to inhabit the sound pulsating from the speakers and singing along -- probably to the Stones' 'Miss You' that Richie DJ at Studio played when he saw us on the dance floor." At the time, the pair were struggling acting students, "always aware of the cameras in the room," Ms. Jones said. They remain best friends and artistic collaborators. (As Mr. Sassin put it: "Sara and I continue to dance on.")
3. Queenie Mungin-Davis was minding her own business when she got an email a few months ago from an old friend with the subject line: "I always knew you'd be a star." When she opened it, she found a link to our August story about the 50th anniversary of Woodstock, and there, in the article, was a portrait of her -- which she had never seen. "I walked around in a daze," Ms. Mungin-Davis said in a phone interview. "I was like, are you kidding me?" The friend was Rowland Scherman, the photographer who had snapped her in her headband and striped pants in 1969. Ms. Mungin-Davis, then 18 and fresh out of high school, had come to Yasgur's Farm with a friend from the Bronx and two dates. They lost the dates almost immediately, but soon bumped into Mr. Scherman, who was shooting the festival. The pals spent the rest of the weekend hanging out with him and his musician buddies -- including Jimi Hendrix, she said. A month later, she headed off to Wellesley College, completely unaware that Mr. Scherman had captured her last magical hurrah before adulthood. Now a geologist and a grandmother, she has lived and traveled all over the world. But Woodstock, Ms. MunginDavis said, was "one of the sweetest and most amazing experiences of my life."
4. This 1979 traveler was unidentified when he first appeared in The Times -- just one of the scores of commuters passing through Westchester County Airport. It wasn't until we resurfaced the image by our photographer Joyce Dopkeen for a story about business travel that Caren Haberstroh reached out with an answer to the decades-old question: Who was he? That wasn't just anyone strolling down the tarmac, she said. It was her dad, Mel Rosenbloom. He passed away in 1996, she said in a message, but "I'm sure he would have gotten a kick out of reading the article and seeing his pic as we did!"
5. "The couple in that photo are my parents," Alex Daniels said excitedly in an email. "What a terrific surprise to find them in The NY Times." Mr. Daniels contacted our editors regarding this Sam Falk photograph of a couple in Central Park in March 1962, which appeared in our June story about lunch culture. While it was the first time he had seen the photo, Judy and Aaron Daniels had seen it when it first appeared in the paper. "The original photo was taken with a telephoto lens and we had no idea that the picture had been taken," Judy recalled. "I'm not sure which was a bigger surprise -- the original or the one this summer!" Newlyweds at the time, Judy and Aaron celebrated their 58th wedding anniversary in November.
6. When this Bengt af Geijerstam photo from the Indians of All Tribes occupation of Alcatraz Island first appeared in 1970, the figures in it were identified only as John Trudell and family. After we published our story about the occupation in November, we heard from Fenicia Ordóñez, on the right, who had been married to John at the time. "OMGoodness! What a great picture," she said in an email. "That is me and John. He is holding Tara, our daughter, and I am holding Mari, my daughter from my first marriage." At the time of this photo, Ms. Ordóñez was pregnant with the couple's son Wovoka, who was born on the island on July 20, 1970. Their apartment, she recalled, was on the third floor of the married guards' quarters in the former prison. "Thanks for an interesting walk way down memory lane," she said.
7. Belle Brett reached out to our editors after spotting a familiar face in the background of this photo of a Spanish dancer on the Lower East Side in 1964, which appeared in our special section "Perpetual Motion" in April. "Even though the photo was from an event 55 years ago, I spotted my sister immediately," Ms. Brett said. She and her sister, Beth, had come to New York for the World's Fair that summer, when Belle was 16. Beth, then 19, left her alone at the hotel one night to go out clubbing with her friend Arlene (center, in white). Our photographer Sam Falk captured them seated in the front row with another friend, Fausto, as they watched the dancer perform. Beth (left), who was a fashion student at the time, went on to become a knitwear designer. "I lost my sister to cancer in 2003, and the photo is such a sweet memory," Belle said.

Texto completo: Why the 2010s were at once strangely uneventful and yet psychologically traumatic.
Nothing much happened in America in the 2010s. The unemployment rate declined slowly but steadily; the stock market rose; people's economic situation gradually improved. There were no terrorist attacks on the scale of 9/11, no new land wars to rival Iraq and Vietnam. The country was relatively calm: Violent crime and illegal immigration trended downward, teenage delinquency diminished, teen birthrates fell and the out-of-wedlock birthrate stabilized.
In Washington, D.C., only two major pieces of legislation passed Congress, both of them predictable -- a health insurance expansion under a Democratic president, a deficit-financed tax cut under a Republican. No enduring majorities were forged; control of government was divided for seven out of the 10 years. There were few bipartisan deals, even as the policy fads that came and went -- education reform, deficit hawkishness -- left underlying realities more or less the same. Inertia and inaction were the order of the day.
If this doesn't sound like a complete description of the decade -- well, it isn't. It's a provocation that leaves out a lot of important indicators (the opioid epidemic and the collapsing birthrate above all), that deliberately doesn't mention populism, the Great Awokening or Donald Trump, and that ignores the feeling of crisis, the paranoia and mistrust and hysteria, that have pervaded our public life throughout the later 2010s.
[ Listen to "The Argument" podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt. ]
But the provocation represents a truth that's important for interpreting all that paranoia and polarization and mistrust -- because even if you believe that the mood of crisis, the feeling that the liberal order might be cracking up, is the defining feature of the departing decade, you still have to reckon with why that feeling has crested so powerfully in a period surprisingly short on world-altering events.
Consider, by way of contrast, the prior decade to this one. Between 2000 and 2009, the United States experienced the Florida recount and the dot-com bust, suffered the worst attack on our shores since Pearl Harbor, launched two major foreign invasions, attempted and failed at the transformation of the Middle East and entered the worst economic meltdown since the Great Depression. Meanwhile disruption was everywhere: Newspapers perished, partisan cable networks ascended, the smartphone took over the world, and the Amazon-Google-Facebook internet consolidated into something like its current shape.
Compared to this litany, the 2010s look a little uneventful, don't they? Even if you declare Obamacare a big [expletive] deal and grant Trump's election world-historical significance, even if you bring in European dramas like Brexit and the Syrian refugee crisis, even if you pretend self-driving cars are really happening (just as soon as they learn to drive in rain ...) ... even then, the last decade's disruptions don't quite measure up.
So why does the psychology of the 2010s, relative to the country's mental situation in the Bush or Clinton era, feel so disappointed, distrustful, and deranged?
Let me suggest, as one possible answer, that we consider American history since the end of the Cold War as a three-act play. The first act, the 1990s, was a period of hubris, when we half-believed that we were entering a new age of domestic dynamism and global power -- that our leaders deserved trust again, that the emerging digital age would be a blessing, that our innovators were on the threshold of great discoveries and our military was ready to spread liberty's blessings round the world.
The 2000s, in turn, were an era of nemesis -- when the most overstretched expressions of that '90s hubris, from the Pets.com version of the new economy to the Bush doctrine to the exurban housing boom, all met their grimly-predestined fate. In one bust after another, in failed wars and Wall Street fiascos alike, the confidence of the Nineties collided with unavoidable realities, and Rudyard Kipling's gods of the copybook headings made their inevitable return.
But as the 2000s ended, the revenges of reality had not yet been properly interpreted. The failed administration of George W. Bush was there as a scapegoat, Barack Obama was there to play the savior, and first liberals and then some ideological conservatives insisted that in fact everything would have been fine, the optimism of the 1990s indefinitely extended, if only Bush had taken their preferred policy course instead.
Bush was, indeed, an unsuccessful president, but this conceit was false, and the gradually-unfolding revelation of its falseness made the 2010s an era of disillusionment, in which the knowledge we gained mattered more than the new events that we experienced. The sense of crisis, alienation and betrayal emerged more from backward glances than new disasters, reflecting newly-awakened -- or awokened, if you prefer -- readings of our recent history, our entire post-Cold War arc.
Thus, for instance, our Afghanistan and Libyan follies weren't nearly as important or destructive as our Iraq debacle of the prior decade, but they were more revelatory -- in the sense of demonstrating that humanitarian interventions and nation-building projects don't work out any better with liberal technocrats in charge than under Cheneyites, that there wasn't a simple "good war" waiting to be fought by smarter people once the Bush-era cowboy spirit went away.
Or again, the election of Trump probably wasn't the moment of authoritarianism descending -- but it was an important moment of exposure, which revealed things about race relations and class resentments and the rot in the Republican Party and the incompetence of our political class that inclined everybody to a darker view of the American situation than before.
Or yet again, what changed in our relationship to Silicon Valley in the 2010s wasn't some new technology or business model, but our gradual realization of what those technologies and business models were doing to our minds, what they probably weren't doing for social or economic progress, and how the internet might need to be resisted rather than just happily embraced.
Even the apparent trend toward secularization, the decade's most notable religious shift, partially reflected a pattern in which Americans who had effectively ceased practicing Christianity years earlier finally made that disaffiliation official.
Meanwhile, in case after case the 2010s were a decade when cranks were proven right and the establishment wrong about developments from prior decades -- about the wisdom of establishing Europe's common currency, about the economic and political consequences of the turn-of-the-millennium opening to China, about the scale and scope of sexual abuse in elite institutions (not just the Catholic Church, though the cranks were right there, too).
In this sense the Jeffrey Epstein scandal was an appropriate capstone for the decade. Epstein's worst crimes belonged to the 1990s and the 2000s rather than the 2010s, but the full revelations only arrived now, in the age of disillusionment, adding to the retrospective shadow cast across the entire political and journalistic class.
And that shadow feels deeper, in a way, because of the stability with which this essay opened. The 2010s were filled with angst and paranoia, they pushed people toward radicalism and reaction -- but they didn't generate very much effective social and political activity, beyond the populist middle finger and the progressive Twitter mob. They exposed the depth of problems without suggesting plausible solutions, and they didn't produce movements or leaders equipped to translate disillusionment into programmatic action, despair into spiritual renewal, the crisis of institutions into structural reform.
It is this peculiar cultural predicament -- the combination of disillusionment with stability, radicalization with stalemate, discontent and derangement with sterility and apathy -- that I keep calling decadence. Whether it will last another 10 years is an open question; a catastrophe or a renaissance might be just around the corner. But as we usher out the 2010s, this decade of distrustful stability and prosperous despair, it has no rival as the presiding spirit of our age.

Texto completo: The league has been upended in fundamental ways over the past decade, from how teams see players to how players see themselves.
The New York Times is reflecting on the past decade in the N.B.A., which has evolved perhaps more than any other major sports league.
The N.B.A. has been less bound to tradition than the other major sports leagues, embracing uniforms changes more so than the N.F.L. and embracing rules changes more readily than the M.L.B.
But the core of the N.B.A. -- its strategy, culture and narrative -- has been upended in significant ways, both by choice and by urgency, over the past decade. (Remember what free agency was like before "The Decision"?)
Our writers' task was to pick what changed everything for the N.B.A. at its core over the past decade, be it a moment, a theme or a trend.
The Strategy
Senior staff editor and reporter
The 76ers decided that the way to win in the N.B.A. was to lose, and lose a lot. Their scheme, dubbed "The Process," involved making little or no effort to improve the team, losing a lot of games (63, 64 and 72 in consecutive years) and getting great draft picks. The architect of The Process, Sam Hinkie, was eventually fired, but it sort of worked. The 76ers took Joel Embiid with a No. 3 pick and Ben Simmons with a No. 1. It also sort of didn't work. The No. 1 overall pick Markelle Fultz and the No. 3 overall pick Jahlil Okafor did not turn into stars.
But in a big way, The Process really didn't work. Even if Embiid and Simmons someday lead the 76ers to glory, those tanking seasons are lost forever, and the fans forced to sit through a 10-72 season in 2015-16 will always have the dismaying memories of a team that often played hard on the court but was continually undercut by an intentionally woeful performance by its front office.
Did The Process change everything? Let's hope not.
Hall of Fame sports reporter
The N.B.A. Players Association's stubborn refusal to allow the league to institute "smoothing" -- a gradual salary-cap increase starting in 2016-17 season instead of a nearly $ 25 million jump -- paved the way for the Warriors to sign Durant away from Oklahoma City. Golden State's failure to win the championship in 2016 after taking a 3-1 series over lead over Cleveland was another huge factor, since Durant almost certainly would not have chosen to join the Warriors if they were two-time reigning champions. But the cap spike is what made it mathematically possible for the Warriors to afford to sign Durant even with Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green already on the roster. There was no stopping the Warriors from becoming a dynasty once Durant joined them.
Senior staff editor
It is hard to imagine what the decade would have looked like had LeBron James not signed with Miami before the 2010-11 season. The concept of a Big Three was hardly new -- just ask Wilt Chamberlain, Jerry West and Elgin Baylor -- but the teaming up of friendly rivals broke with a tradition in a way that many people found unsettling.
Players, however, seemed to like the idea. With James absorbing much of the criticism, the transactions column was suddenly dominated by players forcing their ways into better situations for themselves, creating would-be superteams.
The concept was taken to a new extreme when Kevin Durant signed with a 73-win Warriors team in 2016, and it continued in this past off-season when James's Lakers traded for Anthony Davis and Durant teamed up with Kyrie Irving on the Nets. Some fans may not like the superteam era, but it does not appear to be going anywhere.
The Culture
Sports business reporter
For years the N.B.A. tolerated Donald Sterling's persistent racism. But in 2014, after TMZ unearthed audio of him uttering racist remarks, Adam Silver decided it had been long enough and barred him from the league for life. Coming just months after he had replaced David Stern as commissioner, the ban signaled Silver's independence and garnered him immense respect from the league's largely black player base.
It turbocharged a decade of player activism that had seen Heat players wear hoodies after the shooting death of Trayvon Martin. Players spoke out on issues of national debate, like the killings of unarmed black men and women by police officers, and teams engaged with movements like Black Lives Matter. The head coaches Steve Kerr and Gregg Popovich regularly condemned gun violence and President Trump.
As the decade drew to a close, the era of league activism crashed into the shores of China, where Daryl Morey's tweet of tepid support for Hong Kong protesters had prompted backlash while the Rockets' owner, the league and prominent players worked furiously to distance themselves from the situation. The Chinese buy shoes too, after all.
N.B.A. editor
It has to be The Decision. LeBron James showed just how powerful a superstar could be -- and a black superstar, at that. Black athletes dominate the N.B.A., and here was one of them making clear that he would control how his talent would be used and to what -- or to whose -- benefit.
The backlash to The Decision and James's subsequent financial power plays revealed a lot of racism -- overt and coded -- among fans and executives and called into question the white boss-black athlete power dynamic pervasive in much of sports. The power to decide who plays where and for how much and when has long been almost exclusively in the hands of white men. James, in the vein of Curt Flood, became an example of how black players could also dictate those choices.
James not only showed other black athletes just how much power they have but also helped everyday black people feel more comfortable leveraging their own talents, too.
The Story
Hall of Fame sportswriter
Just when Andre Iguodala was about to lay the nail in the Cleveland Cavaliers' coffin in Game 7 of the 2016 finals, here came LeBron James with the chase down of all chase downs, blocking the shot and setting up what will likely be remembered as the most important moment of Kyrie Irving's career.
Yes, the foolishness of Draymond Green, who was suspended for Game 5, provided vital assistance to James and company in wiping out a 3-1 deficit and erasing 52 years of sports frustration in Cleveland. But James forever rewrote his personal narrative and cemented his legacy in northeast Ohio and beyond as the man who betrayed Cleveland (2010), came home (2014) and conquered (2016).
Sports reporter
He was not yet a Most Valuable Player Award winner -- or even an All-Star. But when Stephen Curry showed up at Madison Square Garden on Feb. 27, 2013, fans were beginning to see the future. It was a future full of intergalactic 3-pointers and must-see TV live from the West Coast. And then he put on an unforgettable show, scoring a career-high 54 points while shooting 11 of 13 from 3-point range in a narrow loss to the Knicks.
At the time, the Warriors were still two years from assembling their first championship run. But Curry was a new-age star, a savvy point guard who could dribble and pass and shoot -- and do all those things with artistic flair. He was creative and imaginative, and no one had seen anyone quite like him. Now, the next generation wants to be just like him.

Two Dead, One Hurt In Shooting At Church Near Fort Worth, Texas

Texto completo: WHITE SETTLEMENT, Texas - Congregants shot and killed a man who opened fire in a church near Fort Worth, Texas, on Sunday, killing the attacker, police said.
A person shot by the suspect also died and a second parishioner has life-threatening injuries following the attack at the West Freeway Church of Christ, White Settlement Police Department Chief J.P. Bevering said during a news conference Sunday afternoon.
The assailant fired once before the “heroic actions” of the congregants retaliated to cut his assault short, Bevering said.
“Unfortunately, this country has seen so many of these that we’ve actually gotten used to it at this point. And it’s tragic and it’s a terrible situation, especially during the holiday season,” Jeoff Williams, a regional director with the Texas Department of Public Safety, said at the news conference. “I would like to point out that we have a couple of heroic parishioners who stopped short of just anything that you can even imagine, saved countless lives, and our hearts are going out to them and their families as well.”
Authorities have released scant details about the victims, the shooter and what led to the attack.
An elder at the church told the New York Times that one of those killed was a security guard who responded to the shooter, calling him a dear friend.
“He was trying to do what he needed to do to protect the rest of us,” said the elder, Mike Tinius.
“It’s extremely upsetting to see anyone committing violence,” he said.
Tinius said he didn’t know the gunman and that the shooting appeared to be random.
A woman who answered the phone at the West Freeway Church of Christ told the AP she could not answer any questions and that she was told to direct inquiries to authorities.
WFAA, a Dallas-based TV station, reported that the church live-streamed the service on YouTube and that the video showed a man wearing a long coat produce a rifle or a shotgun which he fired twice before someone shot back. Some members of the congregation ducked behind pews while others with handguns rushed the gunman, WFAA said. It said church members can be heard screaming and crying.
The AP hasn’t seen the video, which is marked as private on the video-sharing website.
Two people with minor injuries were treated at the scene, MedStar Mobile Healthcare spokeswoman Macara Trusty said.
Gov. Greg Abbott asked the state to pray for the victims, their loved ones and the community of White Settlement, about 8 miles west of Fort Worth.
“Places of worship are meant to be sacred, and I am grateful for the church members who acted quickly to take down the shooter and help prevent further loss of life,” Abbott said in a tweeted statement.
It is not the first deadly shooting to take place at a church in Texas. In November 2017, Devin Patrick Kelley opened fire on the congregation at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, killing more than two dozen worshippers, before taking his own life.

Texto completo: A man pulled out a shotgun inside a North Texas church on Sunday and opened fire, killing two people, authorities said. It could have been far worse.
Two congregants, both volunteer members of the church's security team, drew their weapons and confronted the gunman, fatally shooting him and saving an "untold number of lives" at West Freeway Church of Christ in White Settlement, a town of about 17,000 people near Fort Worth.
Their actions, described as "heroic" by the Texas Department of Public Safety, brought a quick end to an attack that remained under investigation on Sunday night. Authorities have not provided information about a possible motive.
Officials have not released the names of the victims or the gunman, whom FBI Special Agent in Charge Matthew DeSarno said had roots in the area but is “relatively transient. "
“This team responded quickly and within six seconds, the shooting was over. Two of the parishioners who were volunteers of the security force drew their weapons and took out the killer immediately, saving untold number of lives,” said Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who also hailed the state’s gun laws.
“We lost two great men today," Britt Farmer, the church's senior minister said, "but it could have been a lot worse. ”
'Nothing is going to stop us being Jewish': New York community rallies after anti-Semitic 'terrorism' attack
There were more than 240 parishioners in the church at the time of the shooting, authorities said, and the service was being livestreamed to countless homes.
MedStar Mobile Healthcare confirmed two fatalities — one at the scene and another on the way to the hospital. Hours later, FBI spokesman Jason Wandel confirmed the death of the third person.
All of the victims were male.
"It’s tragic and it’s a terrible situation, especially during the holiday season,” said Jeoff Williams, a regional director with the Texas Department of Public Safety. “We have a couple of heroic parishioners who stopped short of just anything that you can even imagine, saved countless lives. "
Licensed handgun owners can legally carry loaded weapons into Texas churches that do not have posted signs banning weapons. Church security became a major issue in the state after a gunman walked into a church in Sutherland Springs two years ago and fatally shot 26 people and wounded 20 others.
“It was the most scariest thing," Isabel Arreola told CBS11 News. "You feel like your life is flashing before you. "
In a livestream of the church service, the gunman can be seen getting up from a pew and talking to someone at the back of the church before pulling out a gun and opening fire. Parishioners can then be heard screaming and seen ducking under pews or running as papers fly to the floor.
Mike Tinius, a church elder, told The New York Times that one of those killed was a security guard and friend who responded to the shooter. Tinius said that he didn’t know the gunman and that the shooting appeared to be random.
The security guard “was trying to do what he needed to do to protect the rest of us,” Tinius said. “It’s extremely upsetting to see anyone committing violence. "
Gov. Greg Abbott issued a statement of condemnation for the "evil act of violence" at a place of worship.
"I am grateful for the church members who acted quickly to take down the shooter and help prevent further loss of life," Abbott said. "Cecilia and I ask all Texans to join us in praying for the White Settlement community and for all those affected by this horrible tragedy. "
The shooting took place hours after a knife-wielding attacker stabbed five people during a Hanukkah celebration in a rabbi's home outside New York City. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo called the attack "an act of domestic terrorism" and directed the state police hate crimes task force to investigate.

Texto completo: Sue Lyon, the actress who was forever tied to her teenage portrayal of the title role in 1962's "Lolita," died Thursday in Los Angeles. The news was first reported by the New York Times, and no cause of death was immediately given. She was 73.
"How did they ever make a movie of 'Lolita?' " asked the ads for the film, director Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of Vladimir Nabokov's controversial novel about a man in his 40s who becomes obsessed with a young girl. James Mason, Peter Sellers and Shelley Winters also starred in the film.
"From the first, she was interesting to watch," Kubrick was quoted as saying of Lyon in Look magazine. "Even in the way she walked in for her interview, casually sat down, walked out. She was cool and non-giggly. She was enigmatic without being dull. She could keep people guessing about how much Lolita knew about life."

Born July 10, 1946, in Davenport, Iowa, Lyon was just 14 and had had only a few minor credits when she was said to have beaten out more than 800 other young women for the part in "Lolita." Lyon would go on to win a Golden Globe award for most promising female newcomer for her performance. In 1964, writing in the Los Angeles Times, Hedda Hopper declared, "Sue Lyon is the arch prototype of an instant star."
Lyon went on to appear in John Huston's 1964 adaptation of Tennessee Williams' "The Night of the Iguana" and John Ford's 1966 drama "7 Women." She continued to act steadily throughout the 1960s and 1970s in film and TV. Her last screen credit was in 1980's "Alligator."
Lyon was married five times, to Hampton Fancher (who would be a screenwriter on "Blade Runner"), Roland Harrison, Cotton Adamson, Edward Weathers and Richard Rudman.
Adamson was a convict for second-degree murder and robbery in Colorado at the time of their marriage in 1973. When they divorced a year later, Lyon was quoted as saying, "I've been told by people in the movie business, specifically producers and film distributors, that I can't get a job because I'm married to Cotton. Therefore, right now we can't be married."
Lyon had a daughter, Nona, from her marriage to Harrison. She receded from acting and turned away from public life in her later years.
In a 1967 interview with The Times promoting the Frank Sinatra-starring movie "Tony Rome," Lyon, then just 20, said, "To be pretty and to stay pretty are two different things.... You can't take anything for granted, and it's foolish to think you can. You have to think ahead of how to build health and happiness. You have to learn to avoid what is going to hurt you or someone else."

The 235 days that rattled China and shook the world

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- They were 235 days that shook the world, rattled China's regime and refuted the most pernicious wishful thinking since the appeasement of dictators collapsed eight decades ago. Nothing more momentous happened in 2019 than Hong Kong's heroic insurrection.
It began with the April 3 introduction by Beijing's Hong Kong satraps of an extradition bill that would have facilitated the sweeping of inconvenient people into the mainland's suppression machinery that is both Kafkaesque and Orwellian. The convulsions culminated in, but did not end with, Nov. 24's cymbal-crash elections in which the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which had counted on the island city's majority to rebuke the demonstrators, learned the limits of its sterile program of purchasing subservience by promising prosperity.
Elsewhere on China's periphery, Taiwan has a presidential election in less than two weeks. China's President Xi Jinping began 2019 with a Jan. 2 speech identifying Taiwan as the focus of his campaign to make China great again. If -- when, probably -- on Jan. 11, 2020, Taiwan reelects President Tsai Ing-wen, the Taiwanese will have joined Hong Kongers in disdaining the "one country, two systems" fudge as a formula for the incremental suffocation of freedom.
Thirty autumns ago, as the Berlin Wall crumbled and the Soviet Union teetered, approximately 1.5 billion people lived under communist regimes. Today, approximately 1.5 billion people still do. The 1989 figure was 29% of the world's population compared with 20% in 2019, but 89% of today's 20% are caught in the tightening vise of China's Leninism, whose inviolable tenet is that nothing shall challenge the party's supremacy.
With this year's revelations about the million, or perhaps millions, swept into the gulag archipelago in northwestern China, it is possible to hope that in 2020 we will hear less from American businessmen who are as obtuse as they are cocksure. Just 51 days before The New York Times published more than 400 pages of documents on China's concentration camps, presidential aspirant Michael Bloomberg said the CCP's leaders "listen to the public," and "Xi Jinping is not a dictator."
Not content to just "listen to" the public, the CCP, using ever-more-sophisticated technology, surveils almost everything done by almost everyone. Perhaps 2019 foreshadowed the day when today's Bloombergs will be remembered as Charles Lindbergh and others are remembered because they thought dictators in the 1930s were "the wave of the future."
Would that America's serial grovelers had the gumption of the creators of "South Park." When China, a supposedly great power that was actually discombobulated by this animated TV series, banned it, the creators said: "We welcome the Chinese censors into our homes and into our hearts. ... Xi doesn't look just like Winnie the Pooh at all. ... Long live the Great Communist Party of China! May this autumn's sorghum harvest be bountiful! We good now China?"
"We have to stand with Hong Kong, but I'm also standing with President Xi," said America's president, who also said of Xi: "He's a friend of mine." Xi should reciprocate friendly feelings because Donald Trump's biggest blunder, made three days after his inauguration, was jettisoning the Trans-Pacific Partnership, thereby unraveling a 12-nation fabric of commercial cooperation that excluded China.
Two other Trump chums are Russia's Vladimir Putin and Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The former continued his incremental dismemberment of Europe's geographically largest nation, Ukraine, and the latter took Trump's warning against attacking the Kurds as seriously as Trump meant it.
North Korea's Kim Jong Un does not have to settle for mere friendship -- in 2018 Trump said "we fell in love" -- but in 2019 the romance seemed unreciprocated. Kim ended a 522-day self-imposed moratorium on ballistic missile tests, but Trump minimized their importance because the missiles could not reach the continental United States -- just South Korea, Japan and the 80,000 U.S. forces in both places. However, North Korea has given Trump until right now -- the end of this calendar year -- to make additional U.S. concessions, beyond the scaling back of joint U.S.-South Korean military exercises, to avoid "shocking punishment." Fresh concessions are North Korea's price for resumption of negotiations that will lead, if the future is like the last 25 years, to other concessions.
However, because nuclear weapons are at issue, you must remember this: In 1945, having witnessed the New Mexico birth of something used on Japan three weeks later, the Manhattan Project's leaders would have been have been pleasantly surprised had they known that 2019 would be the 73rd year without the use of what they had created. Sometimes what does not happen is itself momentous.

Nonprofit boards and your personal liability

Texto completo: In our last two columns you’ve read about some of the responsibilities of a director on a nonprofit’s board. You may now be thinking, “But why? I’m a volunteer!”
And so enters the lawyer to tell you why in two words: personal liability.
When is a board member liable?
While a board member is a volunteer and afforded substantial protection by law, when duties to the organization are violated (whether through acts or omissions), when certain taxes aren’t paid (notably, payroll taxes), or when a board member engages in self-dealing transactions with the organization or allows others to do so, personal liability may arise.
What are their legal duties?
A nonprofit board member, sometimes called a “trustee,” is a fiduciary — a person who must act for the benefit of another. In this case, a board member is charged with acting for the benefit of the public. It is a serious duty, and a breach of the duties can result in both personal liability and the loss of the entity’s tax exemption.
So what are those duties? In general, a board member owes the duties of care and loyalty.
The duty of care
The duty of care requires the following:
* Exercising proper business judgment based on the best interest of the organization (not its board members and certainly not yourself)
* Being properly informed on all matters voted on, and attending the meetings
* Appropriate information flow in and out (you’re obtaining all information you need to make an informed decision), and you’re not disclosing confidential information to anyone
* Following the organization’s Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws
A board member who violates their duty of care (for example, does not attend meetings, or ask questions about matters they don’t understand, or who, through inaction, allows a behavior detrimental to the organization to continue) can be held personally liable for any damage that occurs. There is a California case where a board, because they couldn’t agree on which investment adviser to hire, allowed a multi-million-dollar gift to sit in a non-interest checking account for two years. This caused the organization to lose significant income, and the board members were held personally liable for that. And, they were removed from the board by the Attorney General.
The duty of loyalty
This requires a board member’s faithful pursuit of the interests of the organization they serve and not the financial or other interests of the director or another person or organization. California law prohibits self-dealing transactions between board members and non-profits.
Serious fines can be imposed against the organization and board members if a transaction is entered into between the organization and an interested director, without steps taken to assure that the corporation did it for its own benefit in a fair and reasonable way that was approved in good faith by a majority of directors then in office (not just those at the meeting where the vote is taken), Did they know material facts? And, prior to approval, did the board consider and determine in good faith after reasonable investigation that they could not have obtained a better deal elsewhere?
Say, for example, the organization needs to paint its building. Director Dave is a long-term board member who happens to own a painting business. Dave offers to paint the building for $X and get it done in the next 48 hours. Board members cannot simply decide Dave is a good guy and deserves some business in return for his years of service, plus, he’s willing to do it quickly so why bother looking elsewhere.
No, the board needs to get bids from other painters and make sure that Dave’s price and quality is the best deal. Does the building need to be painted quickly or does that just to suit Dave’s schedule? Is the price fair? Is Dave properly licensed and bonded?
In other words, board members need to do the same due diligence they would for their selves. If they don’t, they could be liable for the funds lost by the organization. And abstaining from the vote won’t help you — if you don’t feel the board has done its due diligence, you will only be spared personal liability by voting “No.”
The IRS wants a word, too
Board members can also encounter unexpected tax liabilities. The IRS has its own rules against self-dealing (or what it calls “Excess Benefit Transactions”). If a “disqualified person” (someone who in the previous five years was in a position of influence over the organization, such as major donors, board members and executive staff) engages in a transaction with the organization that was to the benefit of the disqualified person, the IRS can exert a penalty against not just the disqualified person, but the entire board, for as much as 200% of the amount of the transaction. If Director Dave had been paid more than the going rate for his painting services, he and the board could face these penalties.
And finally, perhaps most shockingly, board members can be held personally liable for the unpaid payroll tax liabilities of the organization. If payroll taxes are not paid, the IRS will look to all responsible parties — the CEO, the CFO, and often board members — to recover the taxes. This is a very good reason for checks and balances for non-profit financial matters and regular audits.
Emphasis on service
It’s a privilege to serve on a non-profit board. First and foremost it’s a service to the community. To perform that service, always look out for the organization first. And. you should also be certain the organization carries Directors & Officers Liability insurance. It’s the smart thing to do.

Texto completo: COLLEGE STATION, Texas -- Disc jockey Don Imus, whose career was made and then undone by his acid tongue during a decades-long rise to radio stardom and an abrupt public plunge after a nationally broadcast racial slur, has died. He was 79.
Imus died Friday morning at Baylor Scott and White Medical Center in College Station, Texas, after being hospitalized since Christmas Eve, according to a statement issued by his family. Deirdre, his wife of 25 years, and his son Wyatt, 21, were at his side, and his son Lt. Zachary Don Cates was returning from military service overseas.
Imus survived drug and alcohol woes, a raunchy appearance before President Clinton and several firings during his long career behind the microphone. But he was vilified and eventually fired after describing a women's college basketball team as "nappy headed hos."
His April 2007 racist and misogynist crack about the mostly black Rutgers squad, an oft-replayed 10-second snippet, crossed a line that Imus had long straddled as his rants catapulted him to prominence. The remark was heard coast to coast on 60 radio stations and the MSNBC cable network.
Despite repeated apologies, Imus -- just 10 years earlier named one of Time Magazine's 25 most influential Americans -- became a pariah for a remark that he acknowledged was "completely inappropriate ... thoughtless and stupid."
His radio show, once home to presidential hopefuls, political pundits and platinum-selling musicians, was yanked eight days later by CBS Radio. But the shock jock enjoyed the last financial laugh when he collected a reported multimillion dollar settlement of his five-year contract with the company.
Imus' unsparing on-air persona was tempered by his off-air philanthropy, raising more than $40 million for groups including the CJ Foundation for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. He ran a New Mexico ranch for dying children, and often used his radio show to "solicit" guests for donations.
A pediatric medical center bearing Imus' name was opened at the Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey.
Imus, born on a Riverside, California cattle ranch, was the oldest of two boys -- his brother Fred later became an "Imus In the Morning" show regular. The family moved to Flagstaff, Arizona, where Imus joined the Marines before taking jobs as a freight train brakeman and uranium miner.
Only at age 28 did he appear on the airwaves. His caustic persona, though it would later serve him well, was initially a problem: Imus was canned by a small station in Stockton, California, uttering the word "hell."
The controversy only enhanced his career, a pattern that continued throughout the decades.
Imus, moving to larger California stations, earned Billboard's "Disc Jockey of the Year" award for medium-sized markets after a stunt where he ordered 1,200 hamburgers to go from a local McDonald's.
His next stop was Cleveland, where he won DJ of the year for large markets. By 1971, he was doing the morning drive-time show on WNBC-AM in New York, the nation's largest and most competitive radio market. Imus brought along a destructive taste for vodka, along with a growing reputation for irascibility.
In 1977, Imus was ignominiously dismissed by WNBC and dispatched to the relative anonymity of Cleveland. Within two years, though, he turned disaster into triumph, returning to New York and adding a new vice: cocaine. While his career turned around, his first marriage (which produced four daughters) fell apart.
Imus struggled with addiction until a 1987 stint at a Florida alcohol rehabilitation center, coming out just as WNBC became the fledgling all-sports station WFAN -- which retained Imus' non-sports show as its morning anchor.
Imus' career again soared. Time Magazine named Imus one of the 25 Most Influential People in America, and he was inducted into the Radio Hall of Fame. His show began simulcasting on cable's MSNBC in September 1996.
In the decade before his "nappy headed hos" debacle, Imus redefined his show by mixing his comedy segments with A-list guests: politicians (Sen. John Kerry and Sen. John McCain(, journalists (NBC-TV's Tim Russert and The New York Times' Frank Rich, musicians (Harry Connick Jr. and John Mellencamp).
A book plug on Imus' show guaranteed sales, and authors were soon queuing up for a slot on the show.
But he rarely missed a chance to get in trouble, even in the good times. He engaged in a long-running feud with shock jock Howard Stern, who usurped Imus' position as the No. 1 morning host in New York City.
And he outraged guests at the annual Radio and Television Correspondents Association Dinner in 1996, cracking wise about President Clinton's extramarital activities as the first lady sat stone-faced nearby. "We all know you're a pot-smoking weasel," Imus said at another point about Clinton.
A White House spokesman called Imus' bit "fairly tasteless."
One year later, he was sued by a Manhattan judge after ripping the jurist on air as a "creep" and "a senile old dirtbag." Critics carped over the show's content, with Imus' claim that he was an all-inclusive offender deflecting most complaints -- although one show regular was fired in 2005 after a particularly vile crack about cancer-stricken singer Kylie Minogue.
A February 2006 profile in Vanity Fair contained the quote that might best serve as Imus' epitaph.
"I talk to millions of people every day," he said while riding home in a limousine after one show. "I just like it when they can't talk back."
Imus remarried in December 1994, to the former Deirdre Coleman. They had one son, Wyatt.

What's next for Republicans?

Texto completo: The House of Representatives impeached President Bill Clinton on Dec. 19, 1998. It was a Saturday. The votes, in which two articles of impeachment passed, were held around mid-day. By 3 p.m., the House had named its impeachment managers and physically delivered the articles to the Senate for trial.
Impeachment was on. The House, controlled by a Republican majority, was serious about its ultimately failed effort to remove Clinton from office.
Contrast that to today. On Wednesday, Dec. 18, at around 8 p.m., the Democratic-controlled House passed two articles of impeachment against President Trump. Speaker Nancy Pelosi immediately announced that the House would not appoint managers, and the articles would not be delivered to the Senate. The next day, Pelosi told reporters she did not want to talk anymore about it, and the House went into recess until Jan. 7.
Impeachment was not on, or at least a Senate trial was not on. Pelosi was holding out, apparently, for better terms in a Senate trial.
That is where events stand today.
Pelosi acted after a Harvard professor and zealous impeachment advocate, Laurence Tribe, published an op-ed in The Washington Post arguing the Democratic strategy should be "voting for articles of impeachment but holding off for the time being on transmitting them to the Senate."
Withholding the articles, Tribe said, would strengthen Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer's hand as he negotiates with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on the terms of the trial. It would do so, Tribe speculated, "because of McConnell's and Trump's urgent desire to get this whole business behind them."
Without concessions from McConnell, Tribe urged Democrats to withhold the articles indefinitely, because a trial dominated by majority Republicans "would fail to render a meaningful verdict of acquittal."
It seemed a far-fetched idea, to be generous. McConnell and Senate Republicans would be perfectly happy if they never had to hold a trial; after all, they didn't impeach Trump. "I admit I'm not sure what leverage there is in refraining from sending us something we do not want," McConnell said drily.
After the weekly Senate Republican lunch, I asked one GOP lawmaker, via text, what the party's reaction was. He texted back a one-word answer: "Laughter."
Nevertheless, Tribe's idea took off like a rocket in some circles of the Democratic left. His column was published on Monday morning, and by Wednesday night Pelosi had adopted his plan.
Just to be clear: Pelosi has no leverage at all over a Senate proceeding. The Constitution gives the House the "sole power" to impeach, a power Pelosi and her majority used to its fullest. But the Constitution gives the Senate the "sole power" to try all impeachments. The Speaker of the House has no role.
Given that, Republicans have been wondering what Pelosi is up to. Crazy theories -- at least they seem to be crazy theories -- have emerged: Democrats would impeach the president repeatedly. (That was actually a serious suggestion from a New York Times columnist in October.) Or Democrats would never send the articles to the Senate, to keep impeachment hanging over Trump's head. Or whatever.
The key Democrats involved aren't saying. But one plausible notion came from The Hill columnist A.B. Stoddard, who keeps a close eye on Democrats. Party leaders have their eye on the ongoing investigations into Trump, Stoddard said Dec. 19 on Fox News. What about reports of Russian money going to Ukraine figure Lev Parnas' wife? What are prosecutors in the Southern District of New York doing? Is something big coming? There is, Stoddard said, "a lot of pressure on Democrats to wait this out until there is more to throw at the president."
It's not clear precisely how that would work, because the House has already passed two articles of impeachment that make specific accusations against Trump. Beyond that, withholding impeachment indefinitely in hopes that a federal investigation will come up with something big -- basically what Democrats did in the Trump-Russia affair -- might end in disappointment.
In any event, Pelosi is withholding the articles of impeachment. It is unclear how long she will do it, but it seems they will be withheld at least until Jan. 7, when the House returns for business. That alone will delay a Senate trial significantly. (In the Clinton impeachment, as noted above, the House vote was on Dec. 19, the articles were sent to the Senate the same day, and the trial began Jan. 7.)
In the limbo Pelosi has created, almost anything seems possible. Recently, Brit Hume, of Fox News, tweeted that, "If House Democrats continue to play this game, I can't see what would prevent McConnell and the Senate Republicans from dismissing the articles of impeachment for lack of prosecution. It would take two-thirds to convict, but only a simple majority to dismiss." That seemed like an entirely sensible option for Senate Republicans, although one certain to draw howls of opposition from Pelosi and Democrats.
During the House impeachment inquiry, Republicans often complained that Democrats did not observe basic rules of fairness. On one hand, Democrats denied it, and on the other, they argued that the majority can do what it wants. It's true. Given the constitutional authorities involved, the House Democratic majority could do what it wanted during impeachment. Now, if there ever is a trial, the Senate Republican majority can do what it wants. And whatever they choose in the end, Pelosi's gamesmanship will likely make them more united.

The lies and distortions by the hatchet men at Fusion GPS

Texto completo: Glenn Simpson and Peter Fritsch tried to keep the American people in the dark as long as possible. For most of 2017, the founders of Fusion GPS hid the truth about the origins of their now-infamous dossier on President Trump. The real story behind their fight to keep its partisan funding a secret is very different from the version the journalists-for-rent tell in their recent book, Crime in Progress. I know, because I was there.
They smear me, and my former boss, Sen. Chuck Grassley, who was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Then they paint themselves as victims of “ruthlessly partisan” McCarthyite tactics. The irony is rich, given that these former journalists collected a million bucks from one political party to accuse the other of acting as agents of Russia.

The dossier they peddled ignited hysteria about alleged traitors in our government more than anything else has since Joe McCarthy’s Enemies from Within speech nearly 70 years ago. Unlike traditional opposition research, the dossier relied on anonymous foreign sources to allege an international criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. Two independent reviews have since gutted its sensational claims.
The report by the Justice Department’s independent inspector general exposed how the FBI improperly used the dossier to justify domestic spying (a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant). The IG made it clear that the dossier was clearly unreliable. Special counsel Robert Mueller was unable to find sufficient evidence to charge a single American with the dossier’s collusion conspiracy despite two years, $32 million, 500 witnesses, and 2,800 subpoenas-worth of additional investigation.
Like the dossier itself, Fusion’s attempt to defend its work in Crime in Progress cannot withstand scrutiny. It devotes a chapter to denouncing Grassley for asking inconvenient questions about Fusion and the dossier. The essentially fictitious story casts Simpson as “Captain America":
Working to “protect the republic at all costs” from a Manchurian Candidate, with the First Amendment as his only shield, Simpson battles Congressional persecutors who were “trashing the Bill of Rights” by subpoenaing his bank to learn who funded the dossier.
Fusion’s founders target me, as then-counsel to Grassley, for supposedly “pulling the strings” that led to outing their secret. They had promised never to reveal who bankrolled the project. Why? Their book concedes a “more strategic reason” to stonewall: They wanted to control the larger political narrative.
As they write in Crime in Progress: “If it came out too soon that the dossier had been paid for by the Clinton Campaign, that revelation would allow the Republicans to depict [Christopher] Steele’s work as a partisan hit job.” It was “a fact that Fusion managed to keep secret” for nearly 11 months after the dossier became public.
During those 11 months, Fusion’s clients denied their involvement, and Fusion fought to keep anything from coming to light that would contradict those denials. Grassley tried to learn more about the dossier’s claims and Fusion’s involvement. Fusion’s founders claim they would have been willing “to explain their past work” without a protracted battle if “Grassley had simply approached Fusion in good faith and asked.”
Actually, we tried. When I called Simpson, he immediately refused to talk. He lawyered up. He’s also one of only two people who refused to cooperate with the inspector general. Without voluntary cooperation, prying any information loose would prove to be a challenge. Absent a full committee vote, no subpoena could be issued without Ranking Member Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s agreement. Contrary to Fusion’s caricature of our efforts as hyperpartisan, we adopted those new rules in early 2017 to strengthen the committee’s hand in what we expected would be bipartisan oversight work during the Trump administration.
Feinstein was initially willing to question Fusion, but bipartisan efforts to look into the dossier and its allegations soon disappeared. In the beginning, she co-signed document requests to Fusion, which its founders misrepresent in their book as ominous partisan threats solely from Grassley. Feinstein also agreed to subpoena Simpson to testify at a public hearing in the summer of 2017, but he refused to appear, citing his Fifth Amendment rights. We later negotiated a limited voluntary interview in private, where he refused to answer questions on many topics, including who funded the dossier.
Feinstein increasingly began to resist any dossier-related line of inquiry. At the time, Grassley and his staff were unaware the Democratic National Convention’s law firm had funded the dossier or that that a former Feinstein staffer, Daniel Jones, had privately claimed to the FBI that he raised $50 million from “seven to 10 wealthy donors primarily in New York and California.” That money reportedly funds Fusion’s ongoing post-election efforts to vindicate the dossier. It’s unclear how much Feinstein and her staff knew about this at the time.
Grassley played it straight. He supported the Mueller investigation and bucked his own GOP leadership in the Senate to shepherd a bipartisan bill protecting Mueller’s independence through his committee. He worked to conduct vigorous oversight and ask tough questions of everyone, even threatening to subpoena Trump’s son to ensure Democrats had an unlimited opportunity to question him on the record. Of course, Fusion’s narrative omits this evidence of good faith.
The House Intelligence Committee subpoenaed Fusion’s bank records, and in late October 2017, its clients fessed-up to funding the dossier after it became clear they were going to lose in court. New York Times senior White House correspondent Maggie Haberman wrote, “Folks involved in funding this lied about it, and with sanctimony, for a year.” A nonpartisan, nonprofit organization complained to the Federal Election Commission that campaign disclosures falsely described payments to Fusion for opposition research as “legal services.”
During the court battle, Fusion unleashed “a blizzard of filings” in which it “piled on new allegations” of supposed congressional misconduct. The court rejected all of them.
One of the failed tactics that Fusion considered “central” was to argue that the House Intelligence Committee learned “Fusion had an account at TD Bank from someone in Grassley’s staff” and to imply that was somehow improper. While it is true that we had asked about the bank during Simpson’s voluntary interview on the Senate side, it is false to claim, as Fusion does, that we learned the bank’s name from his “confidential” interview and that the information was unavailable elsewhere.
Anyone reading the transcript (p. 17-18) can see that committee staff already knew the bank’s name and mentioned it first. Fusion’s attorney did not ask how we learned it, and we wouldn’t have answered if he had. The committee protects whistleblowers and confidential sources, just as the press does. Fusion had apparently made little effort to keep its bank’s name confidential up to that point. Not only did Simpson voluntarily confirm it when asked, but we also had reason to believe he listed it on invoices to clients, so it was hardly a state secret.
Casting aspersion on the congressional investigators who forced the truth about the dossier’s funding into the open is no more effective in Fusion’s book than it was in the court proceedings. In the end, it’s merely a distraction from the bigger issues with the dossier’s unreliability, which go far beyond the partisan motives of its sponsors.
Although the special counsel and inspector general reports dealt devastating blows to its credibility, Simpson and Fritsch still maintain in their book that “time will tell” whether the dossier “deserves to take its place among” documents that have “bent the course of history,” such as the Pentagon Papers or the Warren Report. A more apt analogy might be the phony list of traitors hyped by McCarthy. But, unlike the Americans targeted in the dossier, a few of McCarthy’s victims actually were colluding with the Russians.

Texto completo: A new video shows the confidential testimony of Navy SEALs who reported fellow SEAL Eddie Gallagher for alleged war crimes.
"The guy is freaking evil," Special Operator Craig Miller said in the video obtained by the New York Times. Miller said he was "broken up about" turning in Gallagher and that it was his first time reporting someone.
Gallagher was acquitted in July of murder and attempted murder, but he was found guilty of taking a picture unlawfully with a corpse. He had been accused of killing an injured teenage ISIS fighter along with shooting at civilians in 2017 in Iraq.
The trove of information obtained by the paper contained dozens of hours of video from the interviews, along with thousands of text messages. Video of the moments before Gallagher stabbed an ISIS fighter was also included.
"I was listening to it, and I was just thinking, like, this is the most disgraceful thing I’ve ever seen in my life," Miller said about Gallagher killing and then posing with the dead ISIS fighter. "I think Eddie was proud of it, and that was, like, part of it for him."
"You could tell he was perfectly OK with killing anybody that was moving," Special Operator 1st Class Corey Scott, a medic, said in an interview. Another SEAL said Gallagher intentionally targeted women and children while bragging that "burqas were flying."
"My first reaction to seeing the videos was surprise and disgust that they would make up blatant lies about me, but I quickly realized that they were scared that the truth would come out of how cowardly they acted on deployment," Gallagher said in a statement about the released videos. "I felt sorry for them that they thought it necessary to smear my name, but they never realized what the consequences of their lies would be."
Special Operator 1st Class Joshua Vriens described Gallagher as a "toxic" person but said he was frightened that Gallagher would sideline him from missions if he were confronted. "He’s just going to do this to a new guy who he can manipulate. So I was like, I’m going to be his right-hand man, so — so no one else got hurt," he said. "So I worked for him, and I kept my mouth shut."
Gallagher met with President Trump at Mar-a-Lago before Christmas. "Finally got to thank the President and his amazing wife by giving them a little gift from Eddie’s deployment to Mosul," the SEAL said in a social media post. Trump pardoned Gallagher of his conviction of posing for a picture with a dead ISIS fighter.

Texto completo: Nara, Japan • In Canada recently, I ran across one of the most anguished mea culpas I’ve encountered in a long time, in a piece prominently displayed in The Toronto Star. Its author, JP Larocque, confessed that in 2008, he foolishly dressed up for Halloween as someone from south of the American border, thus being guilty, all at once, unusually for his considerate homeland, of racial insensitivity, cultural appropriation and a joke in inexcusable taste. That a photo of himself wearing a sign that said, “MEXI-CAN’T” might surface at any moment meant, even more profoundly, that he had “lived with regret ever since.”
I read the piece with care and sympathy, not least because Canada is such a model of global awareness and forward thinking. And it was hard not to feel for this gay man of biracial origin who remained haunted by his tone-deaf cruelty. But a lesser part of me couldn’t help wondering if he hadn’t committed even more egregious sins over the past 11 years (or even 11 days). I certainly have. And whether he didn’t feel that cultural mores and assumptions are always shifting, rendering what was not so exceptional in one era abhorrent in the next.
Aren’t all of us at least a little more mature and discerning now than we were a decade ago, partly because we’ve been schooled by our mistakes? Before long, I was beginning to wonder whether Larocque, a writer for the TV series “Slasher,” wasn’t simply replacing ethnocentricity, noxious and unacceptable as it is, with chronocentrism — a term coined in 1974 to suggest among other things, prejudice against other times, rather than against other races.
One of the blessings of the past few years is that many of us have learned to look with more understanding and clarity at the Other. To be different is not to be worse. Yes, a vicious new xenophobia is arising in many parts of the world in response to the erosion of borders, but in part that’s because more and more others are working to look past the stereotypes and dismissive tags of yesterday. Even as many strive so hard to cultivate tolerance when it comes to race, religion and gender, however, those same people seem ever more ready to countenance intolerance when it comes to earlier times — on the grounds that they were intolerant. The shaky assumption behind such chronocentrism is that we have advanced beyond our forebears to a state of relative enlightenment.
In certain respects — the treatment of women, say, and the L.G.B.T.Q. community, as well as of what Canadians call “visible minorities” — we have. Growing up dark-skinned in an England of “Paki-bashing” and the influential demagogue Enoch Powell predicting rivers “foaming with much blood” if people who looked like me continued to be born in his gray-skied land, I’m delighted to return to a newly open and creative London where the average person was born in another country. My four grandparents, all born in India, came of age in a richly multicultured society, but one in which they had little chance of encountering neighbors from Cambodia or Haiti or Ethiopia, as so many New Yorkers or Angelenos can today. Even 20 years ago, I could never have imagined that in 2008 the United States would elect a president who is a living refutation of black-and-white distinctions.
I’m less thrilled, though, when people fault Shakespeare, say, for daring, in his job as writer (and actor), to try to enter the souls of a woman, a Moor and a devil from Italy (which he does in “Othello” alone). I’m wary of assuming that, just because T.S. Eliot held some positions that we now find offensive, we are more “moral” or attuned to the complexities of human nature than he was. I’m glad that I live in a more diverse world than my grandparents could have imagined, but I’m not sure that means I’m wiser than they were.
For a grateful immigrant like myself, the blessing of America is its freedom from the habits and constraints of the past, its eagerness to right injustices, its belief that we can do better than we did. That is part of what draws people like me here from older and more disenchanted cultures. But those who dismiss the past just because it’s past run the risk of not appreciating the fact that the past, like most of us in earlier times, was imperfectly doing its best. As more and more of us imprison ourselves in the moment — thank you, addictive screens! — we devolve into a “presentism” that shares some of the cruelty of racism. Technology may advance along a relatively straight line, each innovation leading to the next, but human nature does not.
One definition of an adolescent is a person who thinks that what is new is better, precisely because he has so little sense of what is old. One definition of a grown-up is someone who appreciates how little she can be sure of or dismiss. The surest way to be in the wrong is to assume with blind conviction you’re in the right.
As I came to the climax of Larocque’s article — “I can’t expect forgiveness, now or ever” — I said a silent prayer that the writer would not be committing a sequel to his article in 2030, or even next year, berating himself for having values in 2019 that will seem woefully outdated by then. When Oscar Wilde has a character say, “Nothing is so dangerous as being too modern. One is apt to grow old-fashioned quite suddenly,” he’s writing of not just hemlines and suits, but of judgments and assumptions. That we think differently than we did does not mean that we’re better than we were.
Pico Iyer is the author, most recently, of “Autumn Light” and “A Beginner’s Guide to Japan.”

Texto completo: Joe Biden ha asegurado este viernes que no declarará en el ‘impeachment’ en el Senado contra el presidente Donald Trump, si es llamado para ello.
“No lo haré porque está todo diseñado como Trump lo ha hecho durante toda su vida: intentando desviar la atención sobre él mismo. El asunto que se trata no es lo que hice yo”, ha asegurado Biden, en unas declaraciones recogidas por el diario The New York Times.
El exvicepresidente ha asegurado que es todo una “distracción”, a lo que ha añadido que los motivos por lo que sería llamado a declarar en el ‘impeachment’ contra Trump serían “absolutamente engañosos”
Por ello, ha reiterado que los republicanos quieren su testimonio para “desviar la atención” sobre las acciones que ha realizado Trump al frente de la Casa Blanca.
Las declaraciones de Biden tienen lugar después de que la Cámara de Representantes de Estados Unidos aprobara abrir un ‘impeachment’ en el Senado contra Trump, quien se convertirá así en el tercer mandatario del país en hacer frente a un juicio político.
Con 230 votos demócratas a favor, 197 en contra (195 republicanos y dos demócratas) y una única abstención, la de la congresista demócrata Tulsi Gabbard, los cargos presentados en contra de Trump por abuso de poder y obstrucción a la justicia salieron adelante.
La Comisión Judicial acusó a Trump de un cargo de abuso de poder por presionar a su homólogo ucraniano, Volodimir Zelenski, para que abriera dos investigaciones que le beneficiarían para la reelección en 2020: una sobre las supuestas corruptelas del precandidato demócrata Joe Biden y su hijo Hunter en sus negocios en Ucrania y otra sobre “la desacreditada teoría” de que fue ese país, no Rusia, el que interfirió en los comicios de 2016.
Trump también está acusado de un segundo cargo de obstrucción al Congreso por rechazar los requerimientos que le ha hecho la Cámara de Representantes tanto de información como de comparecencia en el marco de la investigación del ‘impeachment’.
Por su parte, la Casa Blanca afirmó que esta decisión fue “uno de los episodios más lamentables de la historia estadounidense”. “Sin recibir un solo voto republicano y sin probar que se incurriese en ningún tipo de delito, los demócratas han sacado adelante unos cargos ilegítimos contra el presidente en la Cámara de Representantes”, señalaron.

Texto completo: "They have never been as popular, with the possible exception of 1924. Now crosswords are more up to date, they're livelier, they feel more modern."
Will Shortz
New York Times crossword puzzle editor
In 1924, the U.K.-based newspaper The Tamworth Herald warned of a dangerous craze that had "enslaved" the United States.
The paper described a "menace ... making devastating inroads on the working hours of every rank of society." People were "shamelessly" participating at all hours of the day. It was dealing "the final blow to the art of conversation."
The culprit? Crossword puzzles.
Yep, crossword puzzles, those grids of black-and-white blocks and often pun-ny clues that appear in the pages of newspapers. They were all the rage in the 1920s, until the nationwide fad eventually died along with the Charleston and pole-sitting.
Nearly a century later and we're in the "golden age of crosswords." Or so says Will Shortz. He should know: Shortz has been the editor of the storied New York Times crossword puzzle since 1993, and before that worked at Games magazine for 15 years.
"They have never been as popular, with the possible exception of 1924," Shortz, who lives in Pleasantville, New York, told NorthJersey.com. "Now crosswords are more up to date, they're livelier, they feel more modern. I think they're attracting a wider audience than ever."
'A good kind of torture' Once upon a time, crossword fans had to rely on newspapers, magazines or published puzzle books to get their fix. Now you can solve them on your tablet or phone via apps (USA TODAY's crossword app was a big hit with its readers), or subscription-based sites like The Inkubator and Fireball Crosswords can send them to your inbox. You can sign up for Queer Crosswords or Women of Letters by donating to specific charities.
"Now there are so many other options and venues," said Anna Gundlach, a puzzle fan and crossword constructor who lives in Portland, Oregon. "A lot of the distribution channels are able to be bypassed entirely."
The proliferation of independent crossword puzzles means a wider range of clues and answers and more provocative content. Puzzle editors at the New York Times reject puzzles if they decide a clue or answer is too obscure. Gundlach said the paper passed on one of hers because it referenced Bell Biv DeVoe.
"The American Values Club, which I've done a crossword for recently, has a more Gen X, millennial bent to it," she said. "Fresher clues, not afraid to swear or talk about sex."
Gundlach has had a nearly lifelong puzzle obsession. For Howard Barkin, a love of crosswords came late. He started solving them in his early 30s during lunch breaks to get his mind off work. Now he's 45 and a legit crossword puzzle champion. Barkin, who lives in Somerset County, finished first place in the 2016 American Crossword Puzzle Tournament in Stamford, Connecticut.
Shortz is the director for the contest, which pits the best crossword solvers against one another in seven games over the course of a weekend, culminating in a final round for the three finalists. Barkin's tournament victory came after solving the last puzzle in 7 minutes, 49 seconds.
The stress was high, Barkin said.
"Most people aren't used to solving a crossword with a timer counting down in a room full of 500 people," he said.
Barkin also constructs crosswords when he frees up time between doing dishes and raising two young daughters. He said his favorite to solve involve "extremely evil" tricks.
"A puzzle that breaks the rules, but for a good reason," he said. "A puzzle where you have to write a Greek letter into a square or something. It's a good kind of torture."
'Wow us' Even with a host of alternatives, the gold standard crossword remains the one The New York Times publishes.
"It's capital T, capital C: The Crossword," Gundlach said. "When people talk about 'the Sunday crossword' or 'the Friday crossword,' that's generally assumed to be the New York Times crossword."
Crossword fans use the hashtag #NYTXW on Twitter to brag about their finish times and offer their often-harsh criticism of that day's puzzle. The Dec. 12 crossword elicited reviews like "Ugh. So Bible heavy and then that twist? No." and "Ok #NYTXW sorry I don't know the ATOMIC NUMBER of NEODYMIUM?!?!"
The paper's associate puzzles editor, Sam Ezersky, doesn't take that kind of criticism personally. His Facebook banner photo is a foul-mouthed pan of one of his crossword puzzles.
"It's an obsessive culture," Ezersky said. "I get being so passionate about something like this."
Ezersky grew up in a Washington, D.C., suburb as a puzzles fanatic and sold his first crossword puzzle to the Los Angeles Times when he was 16 years old. He's 24 now, lives in Hoboken and spends his days sifting through some of the roughly 600 crossword puzzle submissions the New York Times receives monthly (via snail mail only). Some he turns down with nothing more than a glance. Either the grid is an odd pattern, or the words are meh.
"We're just looking for fresh things that really capture our attention," he said. "These days we really need the puzzles to wow us."
Ezersky does not construct puzzles as much as he used to, but he snagged a dream assignment this year, creating the annual "super mega" crossword that ran Dec. 15 in the New York Times' special puzzles section. It was a massive undertaking: a 50x50-square grid with 708 answers. It's so big the clues are printed on a separate page. Ezersky estimates it took hundreds of hours to construct. Still, he would have begged to do it if necessary.
"I know there were other constructors that declined because it's a such a Herculean task," he said. "If I could have been totally no filter and not cared about professionality, I would have been like, 'Please please please please please.'"
An Ezersky crossword from August shows how his mind works when he puzzles out a puzzle. He began with the across answer at the bottom left, where he placed "tech-savvy." He then stacked "heist film" right on top, giving himself the unenviable challenge of finding a down answer that ends with "lv." He did: "capital V."
Once the grid is done, he dreams up clues. He clued "tech-savvy" with "E-sharp?" — that question mark is crossword-ese indicating there's a joke or pun involved — and asked readers to get to "capital V" with the clue "Symbol for 54-down." The answer was "volts."
Constructing crossword puzzles can be agonizing, Ezersky said, but he wouldn't want any other job.
"My mantra to myself is I'm just getting started," he said. "I'm just humbled and grateful to be doing what I'm doing."

Texto completo: Corrections that appeared in print on Friday, Dec. 27, 2019.
PAGES A2-A3
Because of an editing error, an article on Thursday about The Learning Network, a New York Times section dedicated to creating resources for instructors and students to teach and learn using The Times, referred incorrectly to Michael Gonchar's tenure as head of The Learning Network. He has been in the position since January 2019; it is not the case that he will begin in January 2020.
INTERNATIONAL
An article on Wednesday about Australia's volunteer firefighting force referred incorrectly to Balmoral. It is a village southwest of Sydney, not a coastal area of suburban Sydney.
BUSINESS
An article on Wednesday about recent commercial real estate transactions misstated the cross streets nearest to the property at 228 Seventh Avenue in Brooklyn. They are Third and Fourth Streets, not West 23rd and West 24th Streets.
SPORTS
A chart on the "Evolution of the N.F.L." with the "N.F.L. at 100" package on Sunday described incorrectly some links between A.F.L. teams in the 1960s and current N.F.L. teams. The old Boston Patriots should have been linked to the New England Patriots. The old Houston Oilers did not become the Houston Texans; they eventually became the Tennessee Titans, as was noted elsewhere in the chart. And the Dallas Texans/K.C. Chiefs franchise should have been linked to the Kansas City Chiefs, not the Dallas Cowboys.
Because of an editing error, a picture caption on Sunday in a grid of photographs with the "N.F.L. at 100" package erroneously attributed a distinction to Wally Triplett. He was the first black player to play for an N.F.L. team, not the first black player drafted in the N.F.L. (That was George Taliaferro.)
Because of an editing error, an article on Wednesday about Marshawn Lynch's move to the Seattle Seahawks misstated the day of the coming Seahawks-49ers game. As the article noted elsewhere, it is on Sunday night, not Monday night.
OBITUARIES
Because of an editing error, an obituary on Thursday about the songwriter Allee Willis misstated the given name of her collaborator on the song "Boogie Wonderland." He is Jon Lind, not Bob.
An obituary on Tuesday about the journalist Karl E. Meyer misstated who at The New York Times decided not to report in early 1961 that the Bay of Pigs invasion was imminent and that it was being financed and directed by the Central Intelligence Agency. It was the publisher, not the reporter Tad Szulc's editors. The obituary also misstated the given name of Mr. Meyer's paternal grandfather and part of his mother's name. His grandfather was Georg Meyer, not George, and his mother was Dorothy (Narefsky) Meyer, not Narevsky.
OPINION
An Op-Ed article on Thursday about care for the elderly misstated the name of an academic journal that published a report on the likelihood of disability in old age. It is The Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, not American Geriatrics Study.

Texto completo: In 1924, the U.K.-based newspaper The Tamworth Herald warned of a dangerous craze that had "enslaved" the United States.
The paper described a "menace ... making devastating inroads on the working hours of every rank of society." People were "shamelessly" participating at all hours of the day. It was dealing "the final blow to the art of conversation."
The culprit? Crossword puzzles.
Yep, crossword puzzles, those grids of black-and-white blocks and often pun-ny clues that appear in the pages of newspapers. They were all the rage in the 1920s, until the nationwide fad eventually died along with the Charleston and pole-sitting.
Nearly a century later and we're in the "golden age of crosswords." Or so says Will Shortz. He should know: Shortz has been the editor of the storied New York Times crossword puzzle since 1993, and before that worked at Games magazine for 15 years.
"They have never been as popular, with the possible exception of 1924," Shortz, who lives in Pleasantville, told NorthJersey.com. "Now crosswords are more up to date, they're livelier, they feel more modern. I think they're attracting a wider audience than ever."
'A good kind of torture' Once upon a time, crossword fans had to rely on newspapers, magazines or published puzzle books to get their fix. Now you can solve them on your tablet or phone via apps (USA TODAY's crossword app was a big hit with its readers), or subscription-based sites like The Inkubator and Fireball Crosswords can send them to your inbox. You can sign up for Queer Crosswords or Women of Letters by donating to specific charities.
"Now there are so many other options and venues," said Anna Gundlach, a puzzle fan and crossword constructor who lives in Portland, Oregon. "A lot of the distribution channels are able to be bypassed entirely."
The proliferation of independent crossword puzzles means a wider range of clues and answers and more provocative content. Puzzle editors at the New York Times reject puzzles if they decide a clue or answer is too obscure. Gundlach said the paper passed on one of hers because it referenced Bell Biv DeVoe.
"The American Values Club, which I've done a crossword for recently, has a more Gen X, millennial bent to it," she said. "Fresher clues, not afraid to swear or talk about sex."
Gundlach has had a nearly lifelong puzzle obsession. For Howard Barkin, a love of crosswords came late. He started solving them in his early 30s during lunch breaks to get his mind off work. Now he's 45 and a legit crossword puzzle champion. Barkin, who lives in Somerset County, finished first in the 2016 American Crossword Puzzle Tournament in Stamford, Connecticut.
Shortz is the director for the contest, which pits the best crossword solvers against one another in seven games over the course of a weekend, culminating in a final round for the three finalists. Barkin's tournament victory came after solving the last puzzle in 7 minutes, 49 seconds.
The stress was high, Barkin said.
"Most people aren't used to solving a crossword with a timer counting down in a room full of 500 people," he said.
Barkin also constructs crosswords when he frees time between doing dishes and raising two young daughters. He said his favorite to solve involve "extremely evil" tricks.
"A puzzle that breaks the rules, but for a good reason," he said. "A puzzle where you have to write a Greek letter into a square or something. It's a good kind of torture."
'Wow us' Even with a host of alternatives, the gold standard crossword remains the one The New York Times publishes.
"It's capital T, capital C: The Crossword," Gundlach said. "When people talk about 'the Sunday crossword' or 'the Friday crossword,' that's generally assumed to be the New York Times crossword."
Crossword fans use the hashtag #NYTXW on Twitter to brag about their finish times and offer their often-harsh criticism of that day's puzzle. The Dec. 12 crossword elicited reviews like "Ugh. So Bible heavy and then that twist? No." and "Ok #NYTXW sorry I don't know the ATOMIC NUMBER of NEODYMIUM?!?!"
The paper's associate puzzles editor, Sam Ezersky, doesn't take that kind of criticism personally. His Facebook banner photo is a foul-mouthed pan of one of his crossword puzzles.
"It's an obsessive culture," Ezersky said. "I get being so passionate about something like this."
Ezersky grew up in a Washington, D.C., suburb as a puzzles fanatic and sold his first crossword puzzle to the Los Angeles Times when he was 16 years old. He's 24 now, lives in Hoboken, New Jersey, and spends his days sifting through some of the roughly 600 crossword puzzle submissions the New York Times receives monthly (via snail mail only). Some he turns down with nothing more than a glance. Either the grid is an odd pattern, or the words are meh.
"We're just looking for fresh things that really capture our attention," he said. "These days we really need the puzzles to wow us."
Ezersky does not construct puzzles as much as he used to, but he snagged a dream assignment this year, creating the annual "super mega" crossword that ran Dec. 15 in the New York Times' special puzzles section. It was a massive undertaking: a 50x50-square grid with 708 answers. It's so big the clues are printed on a separate page. Ezersky estimates it took hundreds of hours to construct. Still, he would have begged to do it if necessary.
"I know there were other constructors that declined because it's a such a Herculean task," he said. "If I could have been totally no filter and not cared about professionality, I would have been like, 'Please, please, please, please, please.'"
An Ezersky crossword from August shows how his mind works when he puzzles out a puzzle. He began with the across answer at the bottom left, where he placed "tech-savvy." He then stacked "heist film" right on top, giving himself the unenviable challenge of finding a down answer that ends with "lv." He did: "capital V."
Once the grid is done, he dreams up clues. He clued "tech-savvy" with "E-sharp?" – that question mark is crossword-ese indicating there's a joke or pun involved – and asked readers to get to "capital V" with the clue "Symbol for 54-down." The answer was "volts."
Constructing crossword puzzles can be agonizing, Ezersky said, but he wouldn't want any other job.
"My mantra to myself is I'm just getting started," he said. "I'm just humbled and grateful to be doing what I'm doing."

Kamala Harris: Will McConnell Let the Senate Hold a Fair Impeachment Trial?

Texto completo: December 18 - Today the House of Representatives will vote on whether to impeach President Trump. If it votes yes, sometime early in the new year I will take an oath on the Senate floor to uphold the Constitution, review evidence and follow the facts wherever they lead, regardless of party or ideology. Every one of my colleagues will be required to do the same.
As a former prosecutor, I understand the importance of holding powerful people accountable. I know that every trial requires fairness and truth. Having worked my whole life serving the people, I know that any trial that abandons the pursuit of truth cannot be considered fair or just.
But the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, appears more interested in covering up the president's misconduct than in pursuing truth and fairness. He is already trying to limit the impeachment trial by preventing witnesses from testifying, and he has all but announced a verdict. In doing so, he showed the American people that he has no intention of honoring his oath.
Let's be clear: Mr. McConnell doesn't want a Senate trial. He wants a Senate cover-up.
Fortunately, Mr. McConnell does not have the power to unilaterally undermine this trial. Every single senator will be empowered with an equal vote on how the trial will proceed. Though in just the past year, Mr. McConnell has used his position to unilaterally block legislation to restore the Voting Rights Act, lower the prices of prescription drugs and address the gun violence epidemic, he cannot wield the same authority in a Senate impeachment trial.
In this trial, senators will be far more than jurors. Every one of us will vote to determine the rules for the trial, decide which witnesses testify and ultimately serve as both court and jury. Each of us will be called on to uphold our oath with every decision we make. We will all be held accountable by the American people if we refuse to discover the facts relevant to the articles of impeachment.
The Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, has made a reasonable request to hear from four additional witnesses with firsthand knowledge of the president's misconduct and to review documents that shed light on why the administration initially decided to cut off military aid to Ukraine.
We need to hear from Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, who admitted to Mr. Trump's bribery scheme on live television, and from the former national security adviser, John Bolton, who has been shopping stories about Mr. Trump to book publishers instead of speaking with Congress. Every senator should want to hear from anyone who can speak directly to the president's misconduct related to the articles of impeachment.
Even Richard Nixon allowed the key figures behind the Watergate scandal to speak to Congress, and he eventually turned over incriminating portions of his Oval Office recordings to investigators. But Mr. Trump has stonewalled Congress and inhibited our ability to seek justice by demanding that those closest to the center of the Ukraine scandal stay silent.
Senators must be allowed to subpoena relevant witnesses and submit questions to them directly. The Senate should not vote on any article of impeachment or consider a motion to dismiss the trial until we have reviewed the additional testimony and evidence that Mr. Schumer has requested.
I have never been in a courtroom where the accused can unilaterally block witnesses from testifying or prohibit prosecutors from asking witnesses questions. No court would allow a trial to proceed this way, and neither should any member of the Senate.
Ensuring the integrity of this trial is a solemn responsibility for every senator, with consequences that extend far beyond any one presidency. My colleagues and I have a duty to use our voice and our vote to insist on a fair trial, rooted in the pursuit of truth. We must demonstrate to the American people that in our system of justice all are equal under law, and that there are not two sets of rules, one for Donald Trump and another for everybody else. We must conduct the Senate impeachment trial in a way that is fair and that reflects impartial justice.
History will judge the actions taken by the United States Senate at a time when our Constitution and the rule of law were at stake. I'll be fighting for justice and accountability, and my colleagues should too.
Kamala D. Harris is a Democratic senator from California.

Texto completo: A reader's monthslong trek gave him a new perspective on the country's political schism. Also: Pedestrian safety in New York City; presidential debate rules; holiday waste; a tourist's tale.
To the Editor:
For the last five months I was in the woods walking from Maine to Georgia on the Appalachian Trail. The decision was rash and easy, made by two friends and me in our winding-down days of high school -- to hike 2,200 miles instead of directly entering the much-anticipated world of college.
The expected fruits of such a journey were apparent: natural beauty; the joy of meeting other hikers; and the simplicity of this ambulatory life wherein the only necessities are food, water and one foot in front of the other.
Yet as I watched the impeachment process unfold on TV, the great schism along party lines ever deepening, I thought back to the acts of benevolence we saw from people of all 14 states we hiked through. My fellow hikers and I were grateful to all the strangers who offered a bed, food, water, hot chocolate, extra supplies, hitchhikes or whatever we needed. This support came from Trump supporters, from Bernie Sanders supporters, from the unknowing or indifferent; what mattered was that we could use the help.
It brings me solace and hope to know that the televised division of our country illustrated by our elected officials is not a thorough representation of the state of the union or the character of its citizens. It is worthwhile to go out and interact with those who are dissimilar rather than allow what is seen on TV to render them uncongenial.

Risking Your Life as a New York Pedestrian
To the Editor:
Re "Six Pedestrians Are Killed Over Three Days in a Series of Crashes" (news article, Dec. 23):
The recent plague of traffic fatalities in New York City is a grim symptom of the withdrawal of a visible traffic police presence on most city streets. While I greatly admire the New York Police Department's success in reducing violent crime, a lack of traffic enforcement has led to chaotic conditions on the streets.
As any pedestrian can attest, simply crossing the street is often a near-death experience, with trucks and taxis plowing through crowded crosswalks with no concern for those they are almost running down or worry about getting caught. At major intersections, drivers routinely zoom through red lights or block crosswalks.
If Mayor Bill de Blasio is genuinely concerned about making streets safer, he would be well advised to deploy more traffic police to rigorously enforce existing laws. An expensive traffic ticket is an excellent deterrent to bad driving and would easily pay for any increase in police deployments to protect pedestrians.

Debate Standards Are Too Strict
To the Editor:
Re "Stricter Standards in the Next Round" (news article, Dec. 21):
It's unfair of the Democratic National Committee to set such strict standards for candidates to qualify for the next debate. At this point in the pre-election cycle, a candidate's polling numbers can fluctuate, and we should not limit the field so much just yet.
The D.N.C. should strongly consider the request by Cory Booker and others to lower the threshold for the next debate. We want to hear more.

Wasteful Wrapping Paper
To the Editor:
Re "Santa's Workshop Is a Big Eco-Mess" (Thursday Styles, Dec. 19):
Thank you for pointing out the ecological downside of the holidays, especially wrapping paper. According to Sundale Research, Americans spent about $ 8 billion last year on wrapping paper. Not only is that a lot of waste for our landfills, but it's also an expensive habit for something that gets ripped open in seconds.
It has been estimated that if every family wrapped just three presents in reused materials, it would save enough paper to cover 45,000 football fields. It doesn't have to be ugly brown paper either. Personally, I've found the switch quite easy using colorful special sections of The New York Times!

A New York Story
To the Editor:
As a tourist, I've heard how cold people can be in New York City, but this was not my experience. Visiting from Toronto this month, I was often approached by helpful passers-by while trying to figure out subway routes and rubbernecking to get my bearings. And then, this!
During my visit I was saddened to notice that a Christmas card that I had composed to a dear friend who lives in Pennsylvania had gone missing from my purse. Returning home, I received a text from that same friend with a photo of an envelope. On the back was written, "I found this card in Central Park. It must have come out of the sender's pocket. So I put a stamp on it and sent it to you! Merry Christmas!"
Now I, too, ❤️ New York.

Texto completo: Willem Dafoe stars in an adventure movie on Disney Plus. And a PBS program looks at Christmastime in Tudor England.
What's Streaming
TOGO (2019) Stream on Disney Plus. Willem Dafoe throws on a fur coat and hat and takes to the snow-covered mountains in this adventure film, which has skipped theaters in favor of a debut on Disney's new streaming service. The movie is based on the 1925 serum run, during which antitoxins were transported hundreds of miles by dog sled to fight a deadly disease outbreak in Nome, Alaska -- in the middle of a brutal winter storm. It's often associated with Balto, the dog that completed the run (and got a 1990s big-screen animated feature out of the deal). The new movie focuses on a different dog, Togo, and his trainer and musher (played by Dafoe). The story creates drama from a classic combination of heroism and harsh conditions. "It's going to be bad," Dafoe's character says early in the film, sizing up the coming storm. How bad? "Memorable, I think."
LORO (2019) Stream on Hulu; rent on Amazon, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube. The Italian director Paolo Sorrentino creates an excessive portrait of an unrestrained figure in this satirical drama, which casts Toni Servillo as the former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. "In some ways Berlusconi, a media mogul and cruise-ship crooner in earlier phases of his career, a creature of appetite and excess, is Sorrentino's ideal subject," A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times. "But the overlap in their sensibilities turns 'Loro' into a blurry, distracted, sentimental portrait."
THE WITCHER Stream on Netflix. Audiences don't even need to wait for a title card to see the first beast being slain in the opening scene of "The Witcher." The show -- a fantasy series and a clear response by Netflix to "Game of Thrones" -- stars Henry Cavill as Geralt of Rivia, an imposing monster hunter with a conscience. Based on books by the Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski (which have also inspired a popular video game series), the show follows Geralt during business hours (he's essentially an exterminator of mythical brutes) and outside of them, as his story intersects with the lives of a sorceress (played Anya Chalotra) and a young princess (Freya Allan). Cavill "brings a convincing physical presence and some wry humanity and emotional depth to 'The Witcher,"' Mike Hale wrote in his review for The Times. "He's operating above the level of the material (and most of the rest of the cast), and if you're susceptible to the fantasy genre even when it's executed in routine fashion, he could tip the scale in favor of watching."
What's on TV
LUCY WORSLEY'S 12 DAYS OF TUDOR CHRISTMAS 8 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). The British historian Lucy Worsley hosts this holiday program, which explores what Christmas looked like in England during the Tudor period. Out: Christmas trees, stockings and Santa Claus. In: Goblets, creepy masks and roast boar's head ("The snout is definitely the best bit," she is advised).

Texto completo: California’s minimum wage rises to $13 an hour on Jan. 1, and a number of its localities now have wage rates above $15 an hour.
Labor groups promised that $15 would be an economic boon for the state, while then-Gov. Jerry Brown worried that “economically, the minimum wage may not make sense.” The state’s experience with rapidly rising wage rates show the former governor was right to be concerned.
Consider the impact on the state’s full-service restaurant industry, which faces a double-whammy when the wage floor rises. California is one of a handful of states that doesn’t count tips towards an employee’s income; even if a server earns $300 on a Friday night, an effective wage rate of $60 an hour, his employer can’t count one cent of it towards the minimum wage requirement.
Restaurant owners are forced to give a raise to top-earning employees who take home far more than the minimum, with few options to offset the cost.
Paul Fraga, who announced he’s closing Sacramento diner Original Perry’s after more than 50 years in business, explained the dynamic. “For every dollar that [minimum wage] goes up, it costs me around $40,000…I can’t raise menu prices fast enough to compensate [for] that.” He added: “If they could sign a waiver, 99 percent of my servers would be against a minimum wage increase…”
Fraga isn’t alone in feeling the pinch from a rising minimum wage. Another affordably-priced option in town, the beloved Greek restaurant Opa! Opa!, announced that after 14 years in business it would be shuttering its doors. The owner said that since he first opened, prices have increased over 50 percent as a result of burdensome mandates placed on him by the state. Now, fourteen employees are left jobless right before the holidays.
These aren’t just anecdotes. Census Bureau data suggests the state’s restaurant owners have reacted to scaled-up wage costs by scaling back on hiring. In Los Angeles County, for instance, year-over-year full-service employment growth topped seven percent as recently as 2012; it’s fallen every year since then, and dipped below one percent in 2018. In Orange County, growth last year was near-zero.
A similar trend is seen statewide, with sub-one percent growth replacing five percent growth from as recently as 2013. In San Francisco County, stagnant growth turned negative last year, with the city losing nearly 1,000 restaurant jobs. A study published by Harvard University Business School and Mathematica examined the impacts of wage increases in the San Francisco Bay Area. The results were startling. The research found that each one dollar increase to the minimum wage resulted in a 14 percent increase in the likelihood that a 3.5 star (the median rating) restaurant would be forced to close.
Another study, recently released by my organization, found that in states like California with a high minimum wage for tipped employees, full-service restaurants hired 18 percent fewer tipped workers as a share of the workforce. In practice, that means full-service restaurants embrace self-service alternatives where the customer provides much of the service themselves. (The New York Times chronicled a trend in San Francisco of fine-dining restaurants adopting elements of fast-food style service models.)
Will California legislators wise up? Don’t hold your breath.
The state’s Future of Work Commission, which was assembled by the governor to examine future workplace challenges for employers and employees, is stacked with some of the very parties responsible for those challenges. SEIU president Mary Kay Henry, who co-chairs the governor’s commission, has overseen more than $100 million in spending on the Fight for $15, a policy that has forced countless employers to replace human employees with automated alternatives. Another commission member, labor activist Saru Jayaraman, has encouraged other states to follow California’s failed payment model for tipped employees. She’s been opposed in that goal by thousand of tipped servers, who understand the consequences for their own bottom line should their states make California’s mistake.
Gov. Newsom boasts that California is setting an example for the rest of the country to follow. He’s right; the state is showing the rest of the country why a $15 minimum wage is a bad idea.

Jonathan Groff sticks close to Lancaster roots while branching out in film, stage and TV

Texto completo: When he is on stage at the 270-seat Westside Theatre in New York, Jonathan Groff says he often thinks about the Ephrata Performing Arts Center.
He is playing Seymour in an off-Broadway production of “Little Shop of Horrors,” which is being directed by Michael Mayer, of “Spring Awakening” fame, with Broadway veterans Christian Borle and Tammy Blanchard at Westside.
“Everyone is doing this for the fun of it,” Groff says. “It reminds me of EPAC. Nobody is trying to gain anything from it. There are no ulterior motives.”
The show is largely sold out, and reviews have been strong.
Ben Brantley, of the New York Times, wrote that Groff “is generating major nerd charisma.”
For Groff, 34, being onstage is his “ultimate existence.”
“That’s when I’m happiest,” he says. “ ‘Honk’ and ‘Bat Boy’ (shows he performed in at EPAC), it doesn’t get much better than that. And that’s how I feel with ‘Little Shop.’ ”
Hometown plans
Home is never far from Groff’s mind. He returns to Lancaster frequently, though sometimes just for a day.
“He was here for less than 24 hours on Thanksgiving,” says his mother, Julie Groff.
And he recently purchased a house and property next to his father’s farm in Christiana.
It’s a place to live when he’s home, but also, Groff has plans for it.
“I want to turn the barns into creative spaces — a recording studio, an editing suite, a place to write, or a place to have small workshops,” Groff says. “I want it to be inspiring, quiet and peaceful.”
It’s in the future — Groff says it is a 10-year plan — but he is excited about the possibilities.
He got the idea while he was playing Melchior Gabor in the cast of “Spring Awakening,” which he did off and then on Broadway from 2006 to 2008.
“Gideon Glick (who played Ernst and will be replacing Groff next month in ‘Little Shop’) was the first to leave the show, and my mother got a school bus and brought everyone in the cast to Lancaster,” he recalls.
“We hung out in the barn and had a bonfire outside. Gideon said how rejuvenating and inspiring it felt, and that got me thinking. It’s close to New York. Someone could come and spend a couple days here. My dad (Jim Groff) loves the idea, and I love the farm,” Groff says. “So as the years go by, we’ll make it a creative place.”
“When I bought the horse farm in 1987, the Realtor bought the frontage (of the property) and built eight houses. Jonathan bought one of those houses,” says Jim Groff, who is a horse trainer and a jockey. “The view out back is, well, you can’t beat it.”
Both Groffs note that their son won’t be tearing any of the barns down and won’t be changing the house much. As a creative spot, it will not have concerts or performances, but will be a quiet place.
“He wants to keep it all natural,” Julie Groff says. “It’s going to look sharp.”
Big movies
Groff’s career is going at hyperspeed these days.
He had to take time away from the “Little Shop” run for an intense press junket for “Frozen II,” the animated musical film that was released last month and is turning into another massive hit for Disney.
And it was announced recently that Groff will be appearing in “Matrix 4,” a film sequel scheduled for theatrical release in May 2021.
“He’s working with a personal trainer. The ‘Matrix’ people are getting him in shape,” says Jim Groff. “He’s working out every day, and he’s on a really strict diet. What gets me is he had to take a picture of everything he ate for a while.”
“He basically barely has enough time to eat,” says Julie Groff. “He is loving this, but I am sure it will catch up with him.”
There is no rest for the weary. Groff is set to leave “Little Shop” on Jan. 19.
The next day, he starts working on “Matrix 4,” which is being filmed partially in Chicago.
------------
Frozen
“I find it so easy to talk about ‘Frozen II,’” Groff says. “It’s so good, and the relationships with the directors and the the cast have been so positive.
------------
“He’s always wanted to appear in a big action movie,” Julie Groff says. “But he’s really a Disney fan. He always wanted to be in a Disney movie, and that turned out well.”
Indeed. “Frozen,” in which Groff voices mountain man Kristoff, was a global phenomenon and the largest-grossing animated film in history. The sequel is breaking records, too.
“I find it so easy to talk about ‘Frozen II,’” Groff says. “It’s so good, and the relationships with the directors and the the cast have been so positive.
“A lot of my interviews have been with Josh Gad (who voices Olaf the snowman),” he says. “We had such good time. It’s almost like a vacation.”
Groff says that when the first “Frozen” film came out in 2013, nobody expected it to be as huge as it was.
“We had all scattered after the film and didn’t really have a chance to do a lot of publicity,” he says. “So this was like a celebration for us.”
Anybody with children of a certain age will tell you how powerful “Frozen” was for their kids, particularly their daughters. Groff thinks part of the success of the movie was how it empowered the female characters.
“Kristoff is an evolved mountain man,” he says. “I love that he is there to serve the women — a man letting women take the spotlight. That flips convention.”
For a few weeks, Groff was all over TV, appearing on just about every talk show out there, from Jimmy Fallon’s “Tonight Show” to Stephen Colbert’s “The Late Show.”
During his most recent appearance with Colbert, Julie Andrews was another guest.
“Can you believe I met Julie Andrews!” Groff says.
On the show, Groff showed footage of his 3-year-old self dressed as Mary Poppins for Halloween, and noted that his older brother, David, was dressed as The Entertainer, complete with top hat and cane. In the family video, David Groff says of his brother, “He has lipstick on — oooooh!”
“He was trying to upstage me,” Groff says, laughing.
“You’ve got a great mom (to let you do that),” Colbert said.
“I do have a great mom,” Groff replied.
“ ‘Mary Poppins’ was Jonathan’s first real movie. He watched it every single day,” says Julie Groff. “It was my two-and-a-half hours to get things done. He became obsessed with the movie and acted out all the parts.”
His father says that he has always studied movies and other actors onstage.
“When he did stuff at the Fulton or at EPAC, smaller stuff, he would sneak around the corner and watch them every night — watch the changes the actors made,” Jim Groff says.
“Even today he does that,” Julie Groff says. “He never stops learning.”
“I like to call him up and give him my notes after I see a show,” Jim Groff says. “We get a laugh out of that.”
Not easily recognized
You’d think Groff would get stopped by people all the time, especially because of appearances on Fox’s “Glee,” HBO’s “Looking” and the Netflix series “Mindhunter,” in which he plays FBI agent Holden Ford. (Groff says the show is on hiatus at the moment.) But he says he rarely gets recognized.
“I look like a generic white person,” he says. “And I’m mainly on my bike because that’s how I get around New York. I sign autographs if people ask.”
“He said he walked down the street in his King (George) outfit from ‘Hamilton’ once and nobody paid any attention to him,” says Jim Groff with a hearty laugh. “In New York, people don’t bother you much.”
“Things may change with ‘Matrix 4,’ though I hope not,” Julie Groff says.
But Groff hasn’t changed. He still visits with friends from home backstage during a show. He is still accessible and friendly to everyone he meets.
“With Jonathan, what you see is how he has always been,” Julie Groff says.
Right now, Groff says, life is very full. His career is going great, he’s in a relationship with New Zealand-born choreographer Corey Baker, who lives in London, and he’s closer than ever with his family.
“This is a sweet moment in time,” he says.

Texto completo: Sin sorpresa para muchos, Nueva York ha sido calificada de lejos como la ciudad con la gente menos amable en todo el país , según una nuevo sondeo realizado por Business Insider.
34.3% de los encuestados dijeron que los neoyorquinos eran los más rudos del país, casi el doble que el segundo clasificado, Los Ángeles (19.7%).
Los resultados se basaron en dos encuestas en línea realizadas en octubre y noviembre de 2019. A más de 2 mil adultos estadounidenses se les pidió elegir las cinco ciudades menos amables de una lista de las 50 áreas metropolitanas más grandes de la nación.
La noticia no es una sorpresa para muchos. En 2011 el historiador de la ciudad de Manhattan, Michael Miscione, dijo a The New York Times que los neoyorquinos han sido considerados groseros desde finales del siglo XVIII.
“No he visto a un verdadero caballero, un hombre bien educado, desde que vine a la ciudad”, dijo el ex presidente John Adams sobre NYC en 1774: “En sus entretenimientos no hay conversación que sea agradable; no hay modestia, no hay atención el uno al otro. Hablan muy alto, muy rápido y en conjunto . Si le hacen una pregunta, antes de que pueda pronunciar tres palabras de su respuesta, se lanzarán sobre usted nuevamente y hablarán”.
Nueva York es además la ciudad más cara del país y la que recibe más turistas.
Detrás de NYC y Los Ángeles, las siguientes ciudades más rudas fueron Washington D.C. (18.9%), Chicago (18.6%) y Boston (14.9%).

Texto completo: My favorite podcasts of 2019 were those that seemed at first about one thing — Dolly Parton, the reality TV show “Cops,” the mysterious death of New York City punk rocker nearly four decades ago — and carried you away on tangents you never saw coming.
Which, mind you, is not to say I lost all of my ardor for the tried-and-true-crime podcasts, such as “In The Dark,” my favorite of 2018, which just this week resulted in the release on bail of Curtis Flowers, a Mississippi man tried six times who six times had his convictions overturned. There remain plenty of those, though I’ve perhaps become more discerning in my criminal tastes.
The list below presents the dozen podcasts that still resonate for me as the year comes to an end. They’re not in any particular order, so the numbers aren’t rankings, but the first two here are my favorites of the year.
1. Headlong: Running From Cops : Dan Taberski returned this year with his third great podcast in a row – “Surviving Y2K” and “Finding Richard Simmons” preceded this one – and this might be his best. A deep dive into the history of the reality TV series “Cops,” this podcast explores everything from the impact of the show on real-world policing to the way the series may interfere with the rights of the arrested in ways you’d never considered. Entertaining, and it makes you think.
2. The Ballad of Billy Balls : This podcast opens like a typical true-crimer – who killed punk rocker and small-time drug dealer Billy Balls in his East Village apartment in 1982 – but under the empathetic storytelling of host iO Tillett Wright it becomes something much more that incorporates love and grief, family and memory. Billy’s girlfriend Rebecca is an amazing presence throughout the podcast, which reveals one secret after another as Wright seeks the truth of the story.
3. 1619 : This podcast from the New York Times came on the 400th anniversary of the arrival of the first slaves in America. No dry history lesson, the anthology-style five-episode podcast looks at ways in which the impact of slavery has rippled across four centuries of our history tot he present day. Topics range from the economy to land ownership to health care. If you’d like to get a sense of it, dip your ears into the episode by the Times’ Wesley Morris who explores the ways in which black American music seeded every genre we listen to today — including yacht rock.
4. Dolly Parton’s America : Host Jad Abumrad grew up in Tennessee where Dolly Parton is everywhere, and, like many, he took her a little bit for granted. Then Abumrad noticed how in these divided times everyone from MAGA hat-wearers to drag queens loves Dolly, and he started to investigate. He got hours of interview time with Dolly, which is wonderful, but it’s the side trips into the stories of those who know her – in person, by her music, her career – that make this story a wonderful narrative about a singular woman.
5. Crime Beat: Mom vs. Murderer : The second season of this true-crime podcast by reporter Keith Sharon, our (full-disclosure) Southern California News Group colleague, tells the story of the murder of Cathy Torrez in 1994 and the 21 years her mother Mary Bennett fought to see the main suspect — who lived across the street — convicted. It’s a story about a terrible crime, the frustrating injustices of the justice system and a mother’s determination that her child not be forgotten.
6. Lost Notes : This anthology series from KCRW-FM/89.9 and host Jessica Hooper explores the lives and work of musicians in ways unlike any other podcast, digging deep into history and meaning with strong standalone narratives. A punk rock musician with a regional hit when he was 17 questions the sexism of its lyrics as a 56-year-old father. The sisters of the now mostly forgotten all-female rock band Fanny share their story. A writer narrates an audio letter to the musician Cat Power about the impact of her work on the lives of him and others. There are more in 2019’s second season.
7. The Clearing : April Balascio had feared for years that her father Edward Wayne Edwards was a murderer, and in 2009, her tip led to his conviction in a decades-old case. In this podcast, she teams with host Josh Dean to explore the legacy of her father’s life and crimes. These included more murders to which he admitted, several more that he likely committed and a few he almost certainly did not. It’s a fascinating tale of a sociopath father and a daughter brave enough to seek the truth.
8. Against The Rules with Michael Lewis : Writer Lewis is responsible for some of the great nonfiction of the past few decades with books such as “Moneyball,” “The Blind Side,” and “The Big Short,” all of which were adapted for film. This debut podcast brings his unique and questioning mind to the topic of fairness. He explores everything from sports to financial markets, law to media, and what happens in a world where fewer people accept the judgments of referees. Smart, funny, thought-provoking — what else you want?
9. Over My Dead Body:Tally : There’s a nasty divorce between two lawyers, and one of them ends up gunned down in the garage at his Tallahassee, Florida home. Host and co-reporter Matthew Shaer takes listeners through the story, which moves from a fairy-tale romance that made the New York Times to the split and crime that followed. This first season of the podcast makes it easy for listeners to come to their own conclusions about who is responsible, but justice isn’t so easily served.
10. Nice Try! : Host Avery Trufelman explores the history of intended utopian communities — the Jamestown settlement, the master-planned modernist city of Chandigarh, India, the Oneida religious commune in New York, among others — and why so often they have failed to find the perfection for which they were intended. Through history, architecture, culture, and beliefs, Nice Try! presents a cool new way of understanding the worlds in which we live.
11. The Thing About Pam : From NBC and “Dateline,” this Keith Morrison-hosted podcast peels back the layers of lies and deceit that led to the wrongful conviction of a Missouri man for the murder of his wife, and the ultimate discovery of whodunnit. “Saturday Night Live” used to skewer Morrison’s intimate style of narration, but it’s a pleasure indeed to listen to him tell this story, which never lags or feels padded like too many “Dateline” episodes do.
12. It’s a Pixies Podcast : The Pixies, one of the great modern rock bands, agreed to something few bands would consider and invited author-turned-podcaster Tony Fletcher into the recording studio for the weeks they worked on their new album, “Beneath The Eyrie.” It’s a fascinating look at the creative process, the collaborative nature of making a record, and the push-and-pull of personalities all working toward the goal of making music together. A must for Pixies’ fans, but almost as essential for fans of any band for the insights it delivers.

Texto completo: This week’s Liberal Media Scream features Meet the Press host Chuck Todd in a post-impeachment funk, talking on his NBC show about America being “in what feels like a more dark period.”
On his show, he noted a lack of “moral leadership” from politicians in the age of President Trump before giving his ominous view.
Todd revealed that before the program that the panel had voted “social ills” as the No. 1 story of the past decade, specifically gun killings at schools and the opioid crisis. After New York Times reporter Helene Cooper rued that in the wake of the Obama-era Sandy Hook, Conn., school shootings, “We were willing to prioritize our gun rights over protecting children in elementary schools,” Todd said, “It’s a reminder of how little Americans turn to politicians anymore for moral leadership because our politicians have totally failed on these two crises.”

Historian Doris Kearns Goodwin said that “losing trust in government means losing trust in our collective ability to do something,” but, she added: “There were positive things about these ‘10s, there was activism. ... More women ran and won than ever before, a lot more people interested in politics. There’s an arc to this decade. You have to see the positives.”
At which point, Todd jumped in: “You have to see it as a historian. In 30 years, this decade may be reviewed differently than we’re reviewing it now. We’re living in what feels like a more dark period.”
And at that he said: “I have five seconds. Sorry, guys. That’s all we have for today. Thank you for watching. Happy holidays. Merry Christmas. Happy Hanukkah and everything.”
Brent Baker, Media Research Center vice president of research and publications, explains our weekly pick: “Americans who love President Trump are inspired by his efforts to reinvigorate the best of American ideals while even many of those disgusted by Trump see the positives in American resilience overcoming Trump, but Todd only sees the worst, a ‘dark’ America. You can always count on a liberal journalist to see and emphasize the bad news over the good.”
Rating: Three out of five screams.

Lessons from Watergate on what impeachment should be for

Texto completo: After working nights and weekends in an attempt to throw President Trump out of office before the voters can re-elect him, House Democrats declined to send their two articles of impeachment over to the Senate. Instead, they recessed for the holidays and left town.
It looks like everybody got something out of it. Nancy Pelosi got a growling rebuke of the president to satisfy her far-left squad and calm the terrified incumbents who live in fear of a primary challenge from a squad wannabe in their own districts. Adam Schiff got the cover of Los Angeles magazine. And President Trump received a most unlikely Christmas present, Republican unity. He’ll also unwrap fundraising totals for the fourth quarter that will be higher than Trump Tower.
The week featured a lot of thundering about history, and a lot of wailing over what some people think is the unprecedented polarization in our country.
It’s not unprecedented. Drop by the Richard Nixon Library in Yorba Linda and walk through exhibits that bring to life the bitter divisions during the Vietnam War. There you can see a real impeachment inquiry, in a National Archives curated gallery that chronicles the events known as Watergate.
On display is a photograph of a page in an address book. It was the first hint of what would come from the 1972 break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate complex in Washington.
The address book belonged to one of the Watergate burglars. On the page marked “H” was the phone number of E. Howard Hunt’s White House office. But why?
The answer would eventually lead to a House Judiciary Committee vote to recommend three articles of impeachment, and to Nixon’s resignation. It’s often said that the cover-up was worse than the crime. You should see what Nixon was covering up.
In May 1971, the White House planned a “dirty tricks” operation. With Nixon’s knowledge, aides hired Donald Segretti to recruit operatives to disrupt Democratic rallies, forge letters on Democratic campaign stationery, and infiltrate rival campaigns with spies. In December 1971, Nixon authorized a phony “write-in” campaign for Sen. Ted Kennedy in the New Hampshire primary, to try to pull votes away from then-frontrunner Sen. Ed Muskie.
These operations were already underway when a former Pentagon analyst named Daniel Ellsberg, who had come to oppose the Vietnam War, leaked a classified study of America’s involvement in Vietnam. The Pentagon Papers were published in the New York Times in June 1971.
Nixon believed he was facing a conspiracy by holdovers from the previous administration who were trying to sabotage his Vietnam policy. He ordered a top aide to have the Internal Revenue Service launch special audits of “political enemies” on a list. The IRS Commissioner and the Treasury Secretary refused to launch the audits, but the attempt was later cited by the House Judiciary Committee.
The House also noted Nixon’s July 1971 order for an investigation into civil servants at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, when he thought they were intentionally misrepresenting monthly unemployment figures and demanded to know how many Jews worked in the unit. That was in the articles of impeachment, too.
In August 1971, the White House asked the FBI to find dirt on CBS News correspondent Daniel Schorr, but the bureau mistakenly thought the president wanted to appoint Schorr to a federal job and conducted a background-check interview. When Schorr complained, the White House put him on the list for IRS harassment, and the House later put that in the second article of impeachment.
In September 1971, the White House “Plumbers” (plumbers stop leaks) broke into the office of Daniel Ellsberg’s former psychiatrist to try to find the confidential notes he had refused to give the FBI.
In early 1972, G. Gordon Liddy and E. Howard Hunt pitched a plan to Attorney General John Mitchell for a $1 million program of counterdemonstrations, bugging and break-ins at the headquarters of the eventual Democratic nominee for president, the convention hotel in Miami, and the DNC headquarters at the Watergate in Washington, D.C. Mitchell told the finance chair of the Nixon re-election campaign to give them $250,000.
The Watergate burglars were caught in June 1972. When the FBI began to trace the money found in the burglars’ hotel rooms, President Nixon ordered the CIA to mislead the FBI into thinking the Watergate break-in was a CIA operation. Hush money was paid to the burglars from the White House’s secret $350,000 political fund.
In November 1972, Nixon won re-election in a landslide, carrying 49 states and 60.7% of the popular vote. But slowly the cover-up was unraveling. Judge John J. Sirica was overseeing a grand jury investigation, the CIA decided to tell the FBI that the burglary wasn’t their operation, Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein reported doggedly on the story, and by early 1973, some of the conspirators were cooperating with prosecutors.
There were guilty pleas and convictions in the first trial, and the Senate voted unanimously to form a Select Committee on Watergate. Nixon passed up a chance to end the cover-up and decided that finding a million dollars in hush money for E. Howard Hunt was the better choice.
White House firings, resignations and denials followed. In May 1973, Watergate Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox was hired, and in October, Nixon ordered his firing. The attorney general and deputy attorney general resigned.
In March 1974, Judge Sirica handed over the grand jury materials to the House of Representatives, and in July the Judiciary Committee voted to recommend three articles of impeachment. In August, the public got the first look at transcripts of Oval Office tapes that Nixon had tried to keep secret. The nation learned that Nixon had ordered the CIA to obstruct the FBI’s investigation. Support for the president collapsed. He resigned on August 9, 1974.
A walk through the Watergate gallery at the Nixon Library shows the hazards of abusing the powers of the CIA, FBI and IRS to go after political enemies. But it’s not Trump who did that.
After a number of investigations, we have learned that during the Obama administration, the IRS targeted conservative groups and the FBI misled the FISA court to get authorization to wiretap a Trump adviser. The CIA’s actions are currently under investigation by special prosecutor John Durham.
One day, history will judge the House of Representatives’ vote to impeach President Trump. Maybe we’ll find out that the House’s aim was off by one president.

Rose Parade grand marshals have the power to inspire

Texto completo: When Rita Moreno, Gina Torres and Laurie Hernandez were announced in October as grand marshals for the 131st Rose Parade, the selection was fitting.
Over the years, several past choices reflected California in some way. These three Latina women (a veteran Puerto Rican entertainer, Cuban-American actress, Puerto Rican-American Olympic gymnast) epitomize the 2020 “Power of Hope” theme in a state where Hispanics comprise the population’s largest ethnic group.
“Through their talent, efforts, persistence and dedication, they have achieved excellence and have given back to the world stories of hope, dreams fulfilled, dignity, respect and inspiration,” Laura Farber, the Tournament of Roses president, said about the trio in a statement.
A look at the careers and accomplishments of the 2020 grand marshals:
Rita Moreno — who turned 88 on Dec. 11 — was born in Puerto Rico and grew up in Long Island, N.Y. She started doing Spanish voice-overs for American films at age 11. A couple years later, Moreno scored her first Broadway role and was soon starring in multiple film, television and theater productions.
The multi-faceted entertainer is probably best known for the performances that netted Primetime Emmys (“The Muppet Show,” “The Rockford Files”), a Grammy (“The Electric Company”), an Oscar (1961’s “West Side Story”) and Tony (1975’s “The Ritz”) — putting Moreno in the rare EGOT club. She also won Golden Globe, Peabody, Kennedy Center, Presidential Medal of Freedom and National Medal of Arts awards.
During the 1970s and ’80s, Moreno did guest spots on “The Love Boat,” “The Golden Girls” and “Miami Vice.” Other notable TV appearances include “Where on Earth is Carmen Sandiego” (the animated series and its 2019 film version), “Oz,” “The Nanny,” “Law & Order: Criminal Intent,” “Ugly Betty,” “Grace and Frankie” and “One Day at a Time.” In late 2020, Moreno will be seen in the Steven Spielberg-directed film remake of “West Side Story,” starring Ansel Elgort.
Having participated in the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, famous for one of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s stirring speeches, Moreno still keeps active in social causes. Two years ago, she joined Jennifer Lopez, Gloria Estefan, Camila Cabello, Marc Anthony and others for the Hurricane Maria benefit single, “Almost Like Praying,” under the name Artists for Puerto Rico. The project was spearheaded by “Hamilton” creator Lin-Manuel Miranda.
Gina Torres , 50, is a Manhattan native who grew up in the Bronx. She started singing as a child, attended a performing arts high school in NYC, trained in jazz and opera and was in a gospel choir. Torres appeared in Broadway plays and musicals working with acclaimed theater legends Tommy Tune and Jerry Zaks.
But her main focus was acting, and the 1990s saw appearances on such TV programs as “Law & Order,” the daytime soap opera “One Life to Live,” “Xena: Warrior Princess,” “Hercules: the Legendary Journeys” and “La Femme Nikita.”
Since the 2000s, the Afro-Cuban actress has gained a reputation for taking tough, confident female roles. She added some big screen work, notably with two of “The Matrix” sequels and more television appearances on “Alias,” “Firefly,” “CSI: Crime Scene Investigation,” “24,” “The Shield,” “Without a Trace,” “Boston Legal,” “Bones” “Criminal Minds” and “Gossip Girl.”
Astute gamers might recognize Torres’ voice work on “The Matrix” and “DC Universe” online, as well as the “Destiny” series and “Lego DC Super Villains.” More recent TV roles include “The Vampire Diaries,” “Hannibal,” “Westworld” and “The Catch.”
Torres spent seven seasons as Jessica Pearson, the co-founder of a law firm on USA Network’s “Suits” and then transitioned to the short-lived “Pearson” spinoff earlier this year. She is now recurring on “Riverdale.”
Laurie Hernandez , like Moreno, knows her way around the dance floor, from jive to cha-cha and tango. She won ABC’s “Dancing with the Stars” in 2016 with partner Val Chmerkovskiy. Hernandez is the youngest winner of the main competition to date.
The 19-year-old Hernandez is an Olympic medal-winning gymnast born in New Jersey to parents of Puerto Rican descent. As a member of the Final Five women’s team at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Hernandez won gold in the team event and silver on the balance beam.
A 2017 inductee into the USA Gymnastics Hall of Fame, she is currently training at Gym-Max in Costa Mesa with an eye toward making the U.S. team again for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo.
Outside of gymnastics, Hernandez has authored “I Got This: To Gold and Beyond,” which covers her young life journey, and the children’s picture book “She’s Got This.” Both appeared on the New York Times Best Sellers list.
On television, she appeared on “Celebrity Family Feud” and co-hosted “America Ninja Warrior Junior” and also voiced the Valeria character on Nickelodeon’s “Middle School Moguls.”
Additionally, Hernandez serves as a global ambassador for STOMP Out Bullying, a prominent national bullying and cyberbullying prevention organization for children and teens.

Texto completo: New York Times bestselling author Ann Patchett's seventh novel, "The Dutch House," is a tale that lingers long after the final page.
A story of home, love, disappointment and forgiveness, the novel centers around the family home of siblings and parents through decades of their changes, longings and, eventually, a comfortable sense of healing that bridges to the next generation.
A graduate of Sarah Lawrence College and the Iowa Writer's Workshop, Patchett has won numerous awards and fellowships, including England's Orange Prize and the PEN/Faulkner Award. She has authored six previous novels, three books of nonfiction, and a children's book.
In November 2011, she became co-owner of Parnassus Books in Nashville, where she lives with her husband, Karl VanDevender, and their dog, Sparky.
Reviews for "The Dutch House" often refer to it as "a dark fairy tale," and, indeed, its main characters – two siblings whose childhoods were darkened by the abandonment of their mother, followed by the presence of a cruel stepmother, and their attachment to a large and looming home – spend their lives lamenting their misfortunes in later years, but are still drawn back to the house. Tell us briefly about their childhood regrets.
Danny and Maeve regret that they didn't get the house. They regret that their stepmother won, and they lost. Funny, but when I think about regrets, I tend to think about my own actions and not the actions of others. I think they see themselves as fairly blameless in how the events of their childhood unfolded, and I think they're right. I don't want to give too much away but when Danny is a teenager, he feels he dealt with a terrible situation terribly, but I believe that as an adult he doesn't blame himself or harbor any regret.
The house that siblings Maeve and her younger brother Danny grew up in – and would be banished from – is practically a character itself. The design and features of this unique structure, not to mention its furnishings – loom as large as its physical presence. In what ways does this house stand as a metaphor of this story?
I think of houses as our public face. Our house is how other people see us. Houses represent our success and our failure, our good times and bad. It's where we store our memories. If you've ever had the experience of driving past a house you used to live in, you remember very quickly how you felt when you were there. So, for Danny and Maeve the house represents a happier time when their mother was still with them, and it also represents the security of wealth. They had never imagined another kind of life for themselves, and while Maeve was already out of the house, and in a very small apartment, Danny had no idea about the turns that life might take. Children rarely do.
The story goes far beyond the siblings' childhood years, continuing through their middle age and beyond – as it unfolds their divergent careers and personal lives, and, near the end, the unexpected appearance of a character. When you're developing a story, do you map out the way their lives evolve for such a long time?
I do. Different writers approach this question differently. I really have to know where I'm going, or I just meander around and get nowhere. I like structure and plot, so I work out the larger details of the novel before I start writing. It's my favorite part of the process, thinking a story up. I don't write things down. I keep everything in my head. That way I don't get too attached to a certain idea. I can change my mind. I can just forget about something. My outlines aren't specific, but I have a clear idea about all the characters, who they are, what they want, as well as their arrivals and departures.
It seems that the Dutch House redeems itself at the end. What does that state for the entire story?
I've been told this is a very sad book and I've been told it has a happy ending. I like the fact that different people can read it in different ways. The house never changes. It is, after all, just a house. It's incapable of feelings, a fact that irritates Danny and Maeve who believe on some level that the house should have collapsed in solidarity when they were thrown out. Again, I don't want to give anything away. Let's just say the house is loved and obsessed over for many generations.
Ultimately, this story doesn't seem to be the expected "good guy, bad guy" tale; rather, it's pretty much everyone doing the best he or she can. Could you comment on that?
I'm awful at writing villains. I definitely lean towards sympathetic characters, mainly because most all of the people I know personally are sympathetic. We seem to be living in a world of good and evil now, and who is good and who is evil depends on who you're listening to. But I think most people do the best they can. That said, Andrea is the closest thing I've ever come to a villain, and I can even see how she was young and in over her head. I keep meaning to try harder with my villains, but I spend so much time with my characters and look at them so closely I can't help but feel some empathy for most of them.

Vote for someone who will work to close the very real gender pay gap

Texto completo: Vote for someone who will work to close the very real gender pay gap
For some reason, people don’t believe in the gender pay gap, but I know that it’s real. The gender pay gap is when women are doing the same work as men but are paid less because of their gender. For every dollar a man makes, a woman makes 80 cents. As a sixth grader, I think it is very surprising that a woman could get paid less than a man doing the same work.
A person’s race plays a big part in the amount women are paid. African American women are paid even less: 62 cents to every dollar a white man makes. If you are a Latina American, you’re paid 54 cents for every dollar. Native American women are paid only 57 cents. For women of color, race makes the gender disparity in pay even worse.
Another example of a gender pay gap involves the U.S. women’s soccer team. An article in The New York Times in 2016 by Carli Lloyd headlined, “Why I’m Fighting for Equal Pay,” says that for every $406,000 a man on the U.S. soccer team makes, a woman makes only $72,000. In addition, the women on the soccer team are making more money for the U.S. Soccer Federation than men.
I’m hoping that our country can vote for a president who will help pay us equally for equal work. We need to elect someone new, someone who can help and someone who understands that the data show the gender pay gap is real. I can’t vote, but I hope that all who can will vote, and vote for someone who will help close the gender pay gap.

Meg Hansen an advocate for freedom
On Tuesday, Meg Hansen launched her campaign for Vermont lieutenant governor. That is good news for Vermonters.
Hansen, a conservative Republican and a former Brownsville resident who now lives in Manchester, Vt., has expressed that she desires to speak on a statewide platform to the issues that are forgotten and overlooked for Vermonters. Knowing there is a need for clear policy direction in areas of tax reform, health care insurance and school choice, Hansen has confidently declared she is qualified for this position, and a review of her credentials would confirm that. While she is not only qualified from a professional, communication and experience aspect, her attributes go far beyond that.
She truly cares about Vermont and its citizens and wants good things not only for herself but the same for all she will represent. Her desire is to uplift all Vermonters, not to use the position to dictate and control every aspect of their lives, as is the goal of liberal Democrats and Progressives such as our current lieutenant governor.
Hansen is a strong advocate for freedom, but it is not the kind that liberals speak of, which is a license to do anything that you want no matter the consequences, whether it is right or wrong or costs taxpayers so much. Hansen’s freedom is one that was envisioned by our founders and involves in its application the most important element that is defined by the word “responsible.”
Election time is coming, and now is the time to start looking around for those qualified to get your vote in November 2020.
Meg Hansen should be right at the top of that list for us all.

School grant rejection was prudent
We care about New Hampshire children and taxpayers. Denying the federal grant for the expansion of charter schools at this time was a prudent and vital decision (“NH Democrats reject charter school grant,” Dec. 14).
The Legislature fought hard to address the property tax burden and school funding. The results, after hard negotiations with the governor, was revenue sharing to towns, temporary relief to schools based on need and creating an independent commission to study public school funding.
The grant was set to open about 20 new charter schools, which have private boards and buildings and minimal regulation on staff, including teachers. They can set criteria on aptitude and achievement for students and can dismiss or expel students with little ability to appeal. Local public school districts remain responsible for special needs students and may be responsible for transportation for charter school students.
Enrollments are dropping and there are more than 1,000 empty seats in New Hampshire charter schools. Many are struggling with funding. An independent group, Reaching Higher NH, estimated that this grant could have cost the state an additional $57 million to $104 million over the next 10 years. Many public schools have bare-bones budgets, which has resulted in closing school buildings, cutting staff, increasing class size, stopping enrichment activities and vital programs, and running out of basic supplies.
Our founding fathers knew the value of an educated citizenry through free public education for all. Our public schools accept every child who comes to them, regardless of ability, aptitude, achievement, family status, sexual orientation or previous discipline issues. We need to focus on and help all the schools we have. We need to let the commission examine and provide guidance on school funding so we can meet the needs of our public schools, not create more issues by opening more charter schools.
We care about the education of our children and alleviating the burden of property taxes. That is why this decision to not accept the charter school grant was prudent and vital.

The Tyranny of the 63 Million

Texto completo: Impeachment didn't undermine democracy. It vindicated it.
When George W. Bush lost the popular vote to Al Gore in 2000 but became president anyway, he did so with almost 50.5 million votes. I didn't know that number until I looked it up, because it would have been unimaginable for that president -- even though he could be quite demagogic -- to brandish it as proof that he represented some quasi-mystical conception of "the people," in contrast to the nearly 51 million citizens who voted for his opponent.
Anyone who pays attention to politics, however, knows that Donald Trump got around 63 million votes in 2016. That number has taken on a totemic significance for him and his supporters; any attempts to restrain his power are seen as a sin against the 63 million. During the long impeachment debate in the House on Wednesday, Bill Johnson, a Republican from Ohio, called for a moment of silence to "remember the voices of the 63 million American voters" whose will Democrats would defy, as if seeing Trump held to constitutional standards was a sort of death.
On the surface it seems strange, this constant trumpeting of a vote total that is more than two million less than the total received by Trump's opponent, Hillary Clinton. Trump didn't just lose the popular vote -- he lost it by a greater margin than any successful presidential candidate in American history. The right's bombastic repetition of Trump's 63 million could be just a propaganda trick meant to bully America's anti-Trump majority into seeing itself as marginal, despite the more than 65 million votes Clinton received. But as I watched impeachment unfold, it seemed like something more than that -- an assertion of whom Republicans think this country belongs to.
Over the last three years, a political narrative has developed that Republicans in Congress secretly dislike Trump but overlook his personal degeneracy in the interest of enacting their agenda. Wednesday should explode that fiction forever.
The Republican identification with Trump is total. Again and again, histrionic Republican congressmen equated hatred of the president with hatred of themselves and hatred of the sacred 63 million. They spoke of Trump with an awe and a maudlin devotion bordering on religious; Barry Loudermilk, a Georgia Republican, declared that Trump had been given less due process than Jesus Christ himself.
If Trump is a martyr, who are his persecutors? You could watch the debate with the sound off and understand. All day, Republican speeches delivered by old white men alternated with Democratic speeches from women, people of color and young people. White men make up 90 percent of the Republican caucus and 38 percent of the Democratic one, and the day dramatized the representational gulf in the starkest visual terms.
With the sound on, you could hear fury and self-pity from the Republicans, along with, at times, outrage that Democrats would have the audacity to speak on behalf of American values. Clay Higgins, Republican of Louisiana, brought with him one of those color-coded maps Trump supporters love, showing how their fewer 2016 votes were spread over much greater expanses of land. "We're not being devoured from within because of some surreal assertion of the socialists' newfound love for the very flag that they trod upon," Higgins said. "We face this horror because of this map."
In a sense, he's right: We face the horror of Trump because the structure of American democracy gives disproportionate power to a declining demographic group passionately convinced of its right to rule. Trump, with his braying entitlement, his boastful ignorance, his sneering contempt for pluralism, is an avatar of a Republican Party desperate to return to the 1980s, or the 1950s, or maybe the 1910s. He can't betray America if, to those who fetishize the 63 million, he embodies it.
At the start of this administration, many who are horrified by Trump, me included, thought that at some point the Republican fever might break, leading conservatives in Congress to check a dictator-worshiping buffoon for the sake of the Constitution they claim to revere. I've become ashamed of my naïveté in imagining any overlap between my ideas about what is valuable in this country, and theirs.
"There's been a lot of talk about the 63 million people who voted for Mr. Trump," the House majority leader, Steny Hoyer, said in his surprisingly moving speech on Wednesday. "Little talk about the 65 million people who voted for Hillary Clinton." With the House's impeachment vote, the America outside of Trump's ruling faction finally mattered.
I don't mean that impeachment was revenge on a minority president made possible only by a brute majority in one chamber of Congress. Before the Ukraine scandal broke, I had harangued leading Democrats to impeach Trump for obstructing the Mueller investigation, for his flagrant violations of the Constitution's emoluments clause, and for cheating in his 2016 election by committing campaign finance crimes, and I'd been repeatedly frustrated by their extreme reluctance. Democrats didn't want to impeach, but once they decided to, Trump's insistence that his Electoral College victory grants him impunity didn't work. For one night, democracy asserted itself.
Much has been made of the fact that the articles of impeachment received no Republican votes; the one conservative who backed them, the former Freedom Caucus member Justin Amash, left the party to become an independent. But there are hardly any moderate Republicans left who might have been open to impeachment because voters in 2018 replaced most of them with Democrats. In the end, Trump's impeachment passed with more House votes than Bill Clinton's. All but one of the Democrats first elected in last year's blue wave voted for impeachment, some at real political risk, given the conservative lean of their districts.
"Today, especially today, I reflect on the founding documents that have set us apart in the world, leading people across generations and across the world to risk everything because of their belief in our great nation," said the Virginia Democrat Abigail Spanberger, a Constitution scarf around her neck, her voice charged with emotion.
Women and people of color, of course, were originally outside the protection of those founding documents. But on Wednesday, the most diverse Congress in history declared that even the most powerful white man in the world should be bound by them. When Republicans act as if that's a sacrilege, they show us what they worship.

Texto completo: As the impeachment battle moves to the Senate, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is wisely holding the line against Democratic efforts to drag it out.
Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., is demanding that Democrats be able to call new witnesses. He insists an impeachment trial has to "pass the fairness test." Fairness? He must think Americans are fools.
House Democrats have rushed to impeach President Donald Trump without evidence he committed a crime. They concocted two phony charges, "abuse of power" and "obstruction of Congress." Then they rigged the House hearings to exclude testimony from the whistleblower, whose complaint was the pretext for impeachment. And bar witnesses requested by Republicans. How fair is that?
Schumer's insistence on more witnesses -- in addition to the 17 already grilled in the House -- is a ploy to boost the House Dems' pathetic case. Get ready for more demands for witnesses and investigations.
No wonder McConnell is telling Schumer to pound salt. The public is fed up. Polls show independent voters and swing-state voters increasingly oppose impeachment. Ending it quickly will allow Congress to get back to serious issues instead of this invented crisis.
Senate Judiciary Committee chair Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., is proposing a brief Senate trial, with no witnesses. "Here's what I want to avoid," said Graham, "this thing going on longer than it needs to."
House Dems will rehash their feeble case to the 100 Senators who serve as jurors. After the White House legal team rebuts, the Senate will deliberate and vote. It could all be done by mid-January. Better yet, start immediately, and have it done before Christmas.
Under the Senate's long-standing impeachment rules, the trial format does not require witnesses. Schumer falsely claims no witnesses means a cover-up. He needs to read the rules.
Predictably, many Republicans seething over unfair House proceedings want witnesses. They're salivating to put the Bidens, the whistleblower and House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., on the hot seat.
But avoiding a battle over witnesses will allow the Senate to focus on the more important issue -- the Democrats' preposterous grounds for impeachment.
Democrats accuse Trump of "abuse of power," a vague charge. They argue a president can be impeached despite acting legally, and that the test is whether he's motivated by "private self-interest" or the national interest.
That's a trap. Who's to say what's in the national interest? Republicans and Democrats always disagree about that. That's why we have elections.
House Dems also charge Trump with "obstruction of Congress" for refusing to surrender documents and release advisors to testify. That's another made-up charge. Trump was prepared to let the courts decide what he has to release. Last week's Supreme Court's decision to review executive branch subpoenas shows Trump's approach is correct. But House Dems rushed to impeach instead.
The Senate's task is to give Trump a fair hearing but also discredit Dems' phony grounds for impeachment. Otherwise, every future president will have to kowtow to the House majority.
Foregoing witnesses doesn't mean the public has to be cheated out of uncovering the truth about possible Ukrainian election meddling, Schiff's link to the whistleblower, or the Bidens' corruption.
Democrats charge Trump with promoting a "discredited theory" that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election. What's the harm in investigating, as U.S. Attorney John H. Durham is currently doing?
The Senate must also probe Schiff's role in engineering the whistleblower complaint. Schiff's staff met with the whistleblower before the complaint was filed. Schiff lied about that until The New York Times caught him. He also refused to surrender documents about his possible dealings with the whistleblower to House investigators.
As for Hunter Biden's lucrative position with a Ukrainian company while his father was then-President Obama's point person for Ukraine, Joe Biden himself admits that "may have looked bad."
It's possible to end the impeachment frenzy and still get to the bottom of these wrongs.
Meanwhile, Trump leads all his Democratic 2020 rivals in the latest USAToday/Suffolk University poll, indicating what the public thinks of impeachment.

Texto completo: [Financial Analysis and Commentary]
Whoever said that relative performance doesn't put food on the table never worked on Wall Street.
A year ago, Heard on the Street's columnists consoled ourselves with the results of the second annual stock-picking contest by pointing out that we lost less than the overall stock market and also beat an index of hedge-fund managers. This year, the team made a profit, but barely enough for a virtual value meal. The 14 "buy" and 10 "sell" recommendations earned an average return, not including dividends, of just 3.8% over four months. More picks lost money than made money.
While many Heard writers' arguments had holes in them, one did so in a very good way -- a "buy" recommendation on Crocs by Hong Kong-based columnist Jacky Wong that preceded a 62% gain. He argued that the company's ugly shoes were gaining support from social influencers and that, despite a strong run over the past year, they remained reasonably valued at 15 times forward earnings. On the other hand, skepticism was warranted for Heard's second-best pick -- a recommendation to sell then-sizzling Beyond Meat shares, which lost nearly half of their value.
A large number of Heard's readers also were skeptical about the surging stock's prospects. Despite being a new and not especially large company, Beyond Meat was the 2nd-most-picked stock out of over 7,000 entries and one of the few that had more readers betting against it than for it.
Subscribers weren't laughing all the way to the virtual bank with some other popular negative bets, though. For example, Tesla, which attracted a record 282 picks and also the most "sell" recommendations at 195, rose sharply. While it wasn't one of our columnists' selections, Heard columnist Charley Grant wasn't enthused about the company after its October share-price surge on a surprise quarterly profit. Netflix was another popular "sell" with 126 out of 166 readers thinking it would drop. The stock rose modestly despite the emergence of stiff competition in the so-called Streaming Wars.
Another stock frequently in the news, former blue chip General Electric, attracted 98 sells out of 150 picks, but the stock rose by about 10%. It had briefly cratered in August, right when the contest began, after Harry Markopolos, the forensic accountant who had warned authorities about Bernard Madoff, made sensational claims about accounting irregularities. Heard wrote these claims "had little merit." And, despite possibly reading somewhere on Twitter that it is "failing," readers betting against New York Times Co. had all the losses fit to print.
By contrast, there were some stocks that were universally loved by readers. Such unanimity is usually a sign to steer clear, but it wasn't in these cases. Retailers Dollar General and Lumber Liquidators both rose, and the latter was the third-best performer among columnists' picks. It was briefly the top performer following reports that its founder had purchased shares on the open market and might take the company private. He instead sold most of them for what was reportedly a nearly 50% gain.
Stocks rose overall with the S&P 500 gaining 8.6% during the contest. In such an environment, it should come as little surprise that optimism paid off for both columnists and subscribers. Four of the top five Heard picks were "buy" recommendations while four of the five worst ones were "sells." Some 42% of Heard's picks called for stocks to fall while only 21% of readers bet against stocks. That helps to explain readers' superior results -- an average profit of 5.1%, some 1.3 percentage points better than Heard's scribes.
There is a wry saying on Wall Street that a long-term investment is a short-term one that didn't work out. While Heard's picks relied more on fundamental analysis than short-term sentiment and may yet redeem themselves, most readers grasped the key to glory in a short-term contest with imaginary money: You either go big or go home.
All five of the top reader picks were money-losing drug-development companies led by Forty Seven Inc., Chemocentryx and Lexicon Pharmaceuticals. Many of the worst picks were companies close to the precipice such as Dean Foods and Superior Energy Services, which stumbled rather than rebounding. Try to catch a falling knife and you'll probably wind up bloodied. Skeptical bets on loss-making exercise-band maker Fitbit, by contrast, blew up when Google agreed to buy the company.
Heard's writers, after three years of being mostly humbled by the market -- and this year also by our readers -- can see the wisdom in legendary investor Benjamin Graham's words that in the short run, the market is merely a "voting machine." As we dust ourselves off, we take heart in the continuation of the quote: that in the long run it's a "weighing machine."

App developer alleges Apple suppressed competitors " until it got caught

Texto completo: An email app developer says it has uncovered new data that suggests Apple has long been suppressing the rankings of apps in the App Store that compete with Apple's own offerings, according to new court filings by the developer, which sued Apple in October alleging patent infringement and antitrust violations.
Blix, which developed the BlueMail app, said it made the discovery only when Apple's rankings suddenly changed in its favor. At the end of September, Blix unexpectedly jumped from 143rd in Apple's ranking for mail apps to 13th. Blix had for years been highly ranked in the competing Android app stores, run by companies such as Google, Samsung, Amazon and Huawei. But on Apple's iOS, where it competes with Apple's mail app, it had long been ranked very low.
Blix started looking at other apps that also compete with Apple's preinstalled apps. Several others, such as a mail app from Russian tech company Yandex, had also seen dramatic spikes in their rankings. Blix says it used the market research firm Sensor Tower to research the unexplained spike in BlueMail's ranking on the iOS store, which happened on Sept.-26. Using Sensor Tower's historical data, it was able to determine that BlueMail was not the only app that had experienced the spike.
'Multiple different types of Apple app competitors enjoyed a sudden, unexplained rise in search rankings,' according to Blix's latest court filing, which appeared Friday. The spike came roughly two weeks after a New York Times article examined how Apple ranked its own apps higher than competitors'.
Apple spokesman Fred Sainz declined to comment on the litigation. On its website, Apple says its App Store provides 'equal opportunities to developers to deliver their apps and services across iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV, and Apple Watch.'
The allegations come as Apple faces increased scrutiny for how it treats smaller competitors. The House Judiciary Committee and the Justice Department are investigating whether Apple has violated antitrust laws. Last month, the top Democrat in charge of the House investigation raised concerns that Apple was using privacy as a way to shield itself from antitrust scrutiny. The committee has requested information from Apple on how it uses the innovations of app developers on its platform in its own services, one of the key allegations in Blix's lawsuit.
The suit brought by Blix is unusual. Most app developers are careful about saying anything that might be construed as critical of Apple. That is because the only way to distribute software to Apple users is with express approval from the company. Apple also decides which apps are included in the lists of apps that it recommends, one of the most important methods of marketing to Apple customers. Taking the company to court is an almost unheard-of method of resolving a dispute with Apple.
Blix's founders, brothers Ben and Dan Volach, are longtime entrepreneurs who have a big dream: to unify email, calendars, contacts and messaging into one app. (They sold a previous mobile messaging company for $140-million in 2006.) Blix, whose 40-employees are based in New Jersey, Britain and Israel, competes against some of tech's biggest giants, including Microsoft and Slack.
But the Volaches, who are represented by the law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart - Sullivan, say Apple may be particularly threatened by mail applications such as Blix, according to its latest court filings. They say that is because Blix, unlike Microsoft's Outlook and Slack, appeals to everyday consumers looking for more feature-rich alternatives to Apple's bare-bones 'Mail' app, which comes preinstalled on iPhones.
And unlike Apple's Mail app, Blix works across platforms including Android, Windows and Mac desktops. 'Apple's dominance in the MacOS Email client market, as well as its Mac computer sales generally, are threatened by cross-platform messaging solutions, such as BlueMail,' the company says in its latest filing.
Blix has also been locked in a battle with Apple to get its corresponding BlueMail app accepted back into the Mac App Store, the desktop version of the App Store for iPhone, after Apple removed it in June.
In Friday's filing, Blix cited examples where Apple has allowed duplicate apps from the same developer. The encrypted-messaging service Telegram, for instance, has two desktop apps, Telegram and Telegram Desktop. The lawsuit alleges they are 'highly similar.'
Blix claims that Apple has put barriers in the way of users downloading the software directly onto their computers by discouraging them from installing any software that is not downloaded through Apple. Apple says the warnings, which it calls 'Gatekeeper,' are meant to prevent the spread of malware.
Blix says Apple uses Gatekeeper to give itself an unfair advantage, calling it an effort by Apple to consolidate power over its desktop software in the same way it controls its mobile ecosystem, essentially giving the company 'monopoly power over MacOS applications,' the complaint alleges.

Durham scrutinizes ex-CIA director as part of inquiry into origins of Russia investigation

Texto completo: U.S. Attorney John Durham is scrutinizing former CIA Director John Brennan as he seeks answers on the intelligence community’s assessment of Russia’s 2016 meddling.
The federal prosecutor, hand-picked by Attorney General William Barr to lead the inquiry into the origins of the FBI’s Trump-Russia counterintelligence investigation, has asked for Brennan’s electronic communications, phone records, and other documents from the CIA, per a source cited by the New York Times.

Durham wants to know what Brennan thought about British ex-spy Christopher Steele’s dossier and the conversations he had about it, whether it was used in the January 2017 intelligence community's assessment dealing with Russian interference in the race between Donald Trump and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, why former FBI Director James Comey and former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe insisted upon it being part of the assessment, how allegations from the dossier ended up in the assessment's appendix, and whether Brennan had been misleading in his public statements about the dossier’s use by the intelligence community.
Durham’s scrutiny of Brennan and the dossier is likely connected to new revelations by Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz from his investigation into Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuse by the Department of Justice and the FBI. Horowitz concluded Steele’s dossier played a "central and essential" role in the bureau’s pursuit of surveillance warrants against Trump campaign associate Carter Page. The DOJ watchdog also found that Comey and McCabe spent weeks pushing for the dossier to be included in the postelection intelligence assessment ordered by President Barack Obama.

Horowitz said the CIA “expressed concern” about using the former MI6 agent’s salacious and unverified allegations, and the allegations ultimately did not make an appearance in the body of the assessment of Russia’s activities during the 2016 election. The inspector general’s report noted that the CIA believed Steele’s dossier “was not completely vetted and did not merit inclusion in the body of the report,” and an FBI agent told Horowitz the CIA dismissed Steele’s allegations as “internet rumor.”
The 2017 assessment concluded that “Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election” and that “Russia’s goals were to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency” while “Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump.”

Robert Mueller's two-year special counsel investigation concluded the Russian government interfered in a "sweeping and systematic" fashion but did not uncover any criminal collusion between the Kremlin and the Trump campaign.
Brennan said in 2018 that the dossier “did not play any role whatsoever in the intelligence community assessment that was done and that was presented to then-President Obama and then-President-elect Trump.” The former CIA head said, “There were things in that dossier that made me wonder whether they were in fact accurate and true” and that “it was up to the FBI to see whether or not they could verify any of it.”
The FBI, the CIA, and the National Security Agency worked jointly to prepare the 2017 report. Horowitz said, "The FBI first shared Steele's reporting with other U.S. government intelligence agencies in December 2016,” during the drafting process. FBI leaders told the CIA that Steele's information was “reliable." Horowitz said, “Whether and how to present Steele's reporting” in the assessment was “a topic of significant discussion” among the drafters.
Ultimately, Horowitz said the final intelligence report “included a short summary and assessment of the Steele election reporting” in an appendix as a compromise between the bureau and other intelligence agencies, concluding there was "only limited corroboration of the source's reporting” and that Steele's allegations were not used “to reach analytic conclusions.”

Brennan said in late October that “John Durham has a very good reputation” and “I would like to believe that any such review or investigation will be conducted in a professional, fair, and apolitical manner.”
"I look back on it, and I feel good about what it is we did as an intelligence community, and I feel very confident and comfortable with what I did, so I have no qualms whatsoever about talking with investigators who are going to be looking at this in a fair and appropriate manner," he said.
Brennan said Durham's investigation could be justified “if the effort is to try to look back and to ensure that things were done appropriately” but said it would be problematic if it veered into “questioning the analytical assessment that was done and the judgments that came out of it.”

Texto completo: President Donald Trump called Boeing to ask CEO Dennis Muilenburg about the company's health, the day before the plane-maker said it would suspend production of the grounded 737 Max, a person familiar with the matter said.
Muilenburg assured Trump that any potential stoppage would be temporary and there would be no layoffs, the person said, who asked not to be identified. Trump expressed concern about the health of the company on the call, which lasted 10 minutes, and whether Muilenburg was doing well, the person said.
Boeing on Monday announced plans to halt production of its Max in January, a move that will deepen the crisis engulfing the company. The timing of regulatory approval for the return of the jet, which has been grounded since March, has slipped repeatedly and remains uncertain with Boeing's relationship with the Federal Aviation Administration in tatters.
Trump also asked about the progress of the software fix for the Max, which is still being tested by regulators in the U.S. and overseas, the person said. Muilenburg said Boeing has a fix ready, the person said.
The White House did not respond to a request for comment and a Boeing representative in Singapore didn't answer a call seeking comment. The New York Times was first to report on Trump's call to Muilenburg.
The decision to halt production is based on such considerations as "the extension of certification into 2020, the uncertainty about the timing and conditions of return to service and global training approvals, and the importance of ensuring that we can prioritize the delivery of stored aircraft," Boeing said in a statement Monday.
The production decision became more urgent after the FAA signaled it wouldn't certify the revamped Max this year as Boeing had anticipated. The company repeatedly warned earlier this year that it would have to reconsider its Max output plans if the grounding extended into 2020.
Regulators halted Max flights worldwide after an Ethiopian Airlines jet crashed in March, the second tragedy within five months. The disasters combined killed 346 people.
The company isn't allowed to deliver the Max while the grounding remains in place. Boeing said Monday it has about 400 airplanes in storage.

Texto completo: Also this week, a mission to expose invisible methane leaks
Welcome to the Climate Fwd: newsletter. The New York Times climate team emails readers once a week with stories and insights about climate change. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. (And find the website version of this week's letter here .)
Don't feel like watching that holiday movie you've already seen 900 times? Then gather 'round to learn about a topic even more timely than Christmas cookies and the dreidel song: our warming planet.
In addition to the best-known titles, like "An Inconvenient Truth" and its sequel, "Chasing Ice," and Leonardo DiCaprio's "Before the Flood" and "Ice on Fire," here are five documentaries to try. Don't worry about spoiling the holiday mood: Most of them end on an inspiring note.
" Years of Living Dangerously "
This series, featuring celebrity correspondents like Matt Damon and Olivia Munn, is a favorite of the climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe. Not only because it discusses climate impacts and solutions, but also because it tackles two huge myths: first, that climate change is a "distant issue," and, second, that we can only fix climate change by "destroying the economy or our personal liberties."
" Merchants of Doubt "
If you've ever wondered how the climate debate became, well, a debate, then this intriguing and infuriating film is for you. Based on a book by Naomi Oreskes and Erik M. Conway, it draws a parallel between the tactics of Big Tobacco and Big Oil, revealing the world of politics, spin and public opinion.
" Mission Blue "
Besides highlighting the work of the oceanographer Sylvia Earle, a National Geographic explorer-in-residence, this film also paints a picture of the devastating changes she has witnessed during her decades underwater. Xiye Bastida, a 17-year-old activist and organizer for Fridays For Future NYC, said it "shows the power we have as individuals to connect with nature and speak for nature."
" This Changes Everything "
Inspired by Naomi Klein's 2014 book of the same name, this documentary "aims to empower," rather than scare, viewers into action. "The film tells moving, personal stories," said Keya Chatterjee, executive director of the U.S. Climate Action Network, "but weaves them into a larger story about how colonialism and greed got us into this crisis, and also how people-power and disruption will get us out."
" Racing Extinction "
Unless drastic changes are made, some biologists estimate we could lose up to 50 percent of Earth's species within the next century. That devastating fact -- a potential sixth extinction, wherein "humanity has become the asteroid" -- is the basis for this fast-paced, wide-ranging film from Louie Psihoyos, who won an Oscar for "The Cove." While some scenes are tough to watch, they're balanced with awe-inspiring nature shots that showcase a world worth saving.

When our tiny plane packed with scientific instruments took off over the oil fields of West Texas, I didn't know what to expect. We'd chartered the aircraft from a research company in an effort to spot "super emitters" of methane, an invisible gas that's helping to warm the planet.
These emitters, scientific studies have shown, are contributing disproportionately to methane emissions from natural gas production, worsening global warming and local air pollution. But would we actually find one?
Over the course of two short flights, my colleague Jonah Kessel and I ended up finding six super emitters. It turns out they're everywhere. But we weren't done.
For the second stage in our reporting project, we drove to each of the sites to try to capture the methane emissions on video. We took a high-resolution infrared camera with us, one that takes methane's heat signals and turns them into images. We stopped along the way to shoot other oil installations that dot the Permian Basin, the country's largest oil and gas field.
What we saw through the camera's lens, which is made of metal, was startling. Innocent-looking storage tanks belched gas. A nondescript shed glowed with gas and fumes. Compressor stations looked like giant fireballs.
Jonah, who is director of cinematography at The Times, set up shots with both infrared and regular cameras, so we could show you what's visible to the naked eye, compared with what isn't. The contrast, as you'll see in these images, was powerful.
I hope you'll take a look at our project. And let us know what you think -- and if you have any ideas about how we can continue to use advanced technology to further our reporting.
We'd love your feedback on this newsletter. Please email thoughts and suggestions to climateteam@nytimes.com .

Texto completo: Readers' views of impeachment: "richly deserved," a Democratic "temper tantrum," holding the president "accountable."
To the Editor:
Re "Trump Impeached" (front page, Dec. 19):
One hundred years from now when schoolchildren read about American history, they will see that Donald J. Trump was the third president of the United States to be impeached.
There will be no Doug Collins or Jim Jordan or Matt Gaetz or Lindsey Graham or Rudy Giuliani or Kellyanne Conway or Sean Hannity to shout, wave their arms, obfuscate and try to spin that cold hard fact.
When the time comes that Donald Trump is but a name on a page, his defiled legacy will be part of his identity for all time.
As his frantic spinmeisters search in vain to explain his richly deserved impeachment away, may I offer them some advice from one of their own: In the immortal words of Mick Mulvaney, acting White House chief of staff, "Get over it."

To the Editor:

Ursula Kugelman
Deerfield Beach, Fla.
To the Editor:
The president was charged with "abuse of power" and "obstruction of Congress." Funny, these charges could have been leveled against any president who arm-twisted foreign leaders for favors, or who legally defied Congress's requests for documents or witnesses by citing executive privilege.
What we have here is the final temper tantrum by Democrats in response to losing the presidential election of 2016. Voters in the middle of our fractured political spectrum are coming around to that. Just wait until 2020. Voters will not be silenced by the House of Representatives.
Tom O'Hare
Charlestown, R.I.
To the Editor:
During the debate over articles of impeachment in the House, many Republican members referred to President Trump as a "duly elected president." What they failed to acknowledge is that the articles of impeachment were designed, in part, to hold this duly elected president accountable and prevent, or at least restrain, blatant interference by foreign nations in the upcoming election of the next president.
If we do not fight against the willingness, indeed eagerness, of the Trump campaign to enlist the help of foreign agents to assist in his re-election, the phrase "duly elected" may become discredited. That is what this impeachment process is fundamentally about -- protecting the integrity of our election process.
Janis Richter
Rochelle, Va.
To the Editor:
Donald Trump now styles himself as the champion of due process for future presidents, again likening his impeachment to the Salem witch trials in a letter to Congress this week.
So where was he on the due process issue in the case of the Central Park Five, accused of beating and raping a young white woman in New York in 1989? Oh yes, I remember. He took out a full-page ad in The New York Times and three other papers calling for the execution of the boys, ages 14 to 16 -- before their trial. They were completely exonerated 17 years ago after the real attacker, already in prison for something else, confessed and was tied to the crime scene by DNA and other physical evidence. In June of this year, Donald Trump still refused to acknowledge their innocence, much less apologize for calling publicly for their executions.
Republicans, I present you your hero of due process.
Stephen Benko
Southport, Conn.
To the Editor:
There is a lesson from apartheid South Africa that is relevant to the impeachment trial and why it must be taken seriously. My father, the late Jules Browde, was the chairman of Lawyers for Human Rights during that draconian rule. He said: "There are some cases you fight because you know you can win. There are others you fight because it is the right thing to do."
Apartheid came to an end, and I believe that this era of blatant corruption by this president and his protectors will, too.
Paul Browde
New York
To the Editor:
I wish the Democrats would be honest and state that they impeached President Trump solely because they can and have been wanting to do so ever since he won the election. They are dishonest in stating that they are sad about it and that this is about constitutional integrity. They did it just because they could, even though they know full well that the evidence and testimony are not compelling enough to win a conviction in the Senate.
In fact, Nancy Pelosi's statement that she might delay sending the articles of impeachment to the Senate demonstrates that it was all about politics as opposed to the integrity of the process. The House Democrats must expedite sending the articles of impeachment to the Senate and accept the constitutional checks and balances on their own power that they imposed on Mr. Trump. Failure to do so jeopardizes our Constitution more than what Mr. Trump ever did.
James S. Kennedy
Smyrna, Tenn.
To the Editor:
Gail Collins's Dec. 19 column, "Impeachment May Drive Trump Batty," injected some much needed light humor into the polarized and deeply contentious process of impeachment. It also inspired a question: What can Chief Justice John Roberts do to ensure due process and faithful interpretation of the Constitution in the impeachment trial?
It would seem that he should have the power and the responsibility to insist on subpoenas being served and enforced to important witnesses that the White House and Mitch McConnell have thus far refused to allow. All pertinent witnesses and all elucidating avenues must be pursued so that the full facts will emerge and justice will indeed be done.
Marjorie L. Spaeth
Philadelphia
To the Editor:
I spent too much time on Wednesday listening to Republicans compare the impeachment hearing to the crucifixion of Christ. I offer this insight from "Monty Python's Life of Brian": "He's not the Messiah. He's a very naughty boy. Now go away!"

Trump’s anti-Semitism order is a Rorschach test for Jews

Texto completo: (JNS) Demographers have spent a great deal of time in recent decades trying to learn more about the changing demographics of American Jewry. But whatever else he has accomplished, President Donald Trump has, albeit unwittingly, gone above and beyond those efforts. In signing an executive order extending protections to Jewish students against anti-Semitic hate on college campuses due to vicious incitement and discriminatory actions promoted by the BDS movement, Trump has, in effect, provided us with a sanity test for Jews.
It consists of the following formulation: If you are so deranged with hatred of Trump and rabid partisanship that you are even prepared to denounce administration efforts to stop anti-Semitism, then you should immediately seek help.
Unfortunately, some Jews are flunking that test, though to be fair, their deluded reaction to the executive order has been influenced by biased media reports and statements coming from left-wing groups that are the product not so much of madness as of partisanship and anti-Zionist sympathies.
The best example of this was an article in The New York Times that asserted that Trump wanted to redefine Jewish identity. In reporting about his executive order concerning the enforcement of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the paper said that Trump is “effectively interpreting Judaism as a race or nationality.” The upshot of the slanted report was that the president’s motive was to distract the country from his own alleged anti-Semitism and to silence criticism of the State of Israel. That was echoed by another report from CNN. Moreover, the Times and articles published elsewhere intimated that it was “inherently anti-Semitic” for Trump to treat Jews as a separate nationality since it somehow fit in with the views of white nationalists to whom he has supposedly been dog-whistling.
Along the same lines, still other commentaries claimed that the action was “bad for the Jews” because it “separated us from other religious groups and saying that we are something other than American.” If that wasn’t enough, it was also asserted that even actions beneficial for Jews would be terrible if they came from Trump. Others carped that the president was suppressing the free speech of principled critics of Israeli policy.
These arguments are all rooted in false premises about the executive order, the reality of contemporary anti-Semitism and the nature of Jewish identity.
The notion that Trump was trying to redefine Judaism is just nonsense. As even the left-wing magazine Slate pointed out, Trump’s order was in line with past rulings by the George W. Bush Department of Education and Barack Obama Justice Department (in an opinion written by then Assistant Attorney General and current Democratic National Committee chair Tom Perez) about extending Title VI protections. The original language of the act did not extend protection against discrimination to members of religious groups when based on shared ancestry or religion. That means that when groups of people are discriminated against on the “perception of shared race, ethnicity or national origin” – as is the case with Jews as well as Muslims and Sikhs – the law offered them no help. Both the Bush and Obama administrations agreed that was wrong.
Trump’s effort orders that the government use the definition of anti-Semitism promoted by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, which is also the one recognized by the U.S. State Department and many other countries. That definition correctly states that “denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g., by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor, applying double standards by requiring of it a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation, using the symbols and images associated with classic anti-Semitism … to characterize Israel or Israelis” and “drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis” and “holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the state of Israel” are anti-Semitic.
The BDS movement routinely violates every one of those points. That means that while it is not anti-Semitic to criticize Israel’s policies, it is an act of hate to support Israel’s elimination or to engage in rhetoric that is drenched in hatred for Jews. Universities that don’t protect their students against that are now going to hear about it from the federal government.
Moreover, this effort has long had bipartisan support, as both Democrats like former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Republicans, sought to remedy the loophole in the law that got anti-Semites on campus off the hook. Legislative fixes failed due to congressional gridlock.
There is nothing new in Trump’s order. But the difference is that although the Obama administration was on record agreeing in principle to extending Title VI protections to Jews, it chose not to act, leaving Jewish students vulnerable. Trump’s Department of Education has reversed that policy, calling for investigations into anti-Semitic activity at Rutgers University, and the University of North Carolina and Duke University to revise curricula that were anti-Semitic. Trump’s measure merely makes that shift official.
Even those partisans whose bias against Trump has undermined their organization’s missions, like Anti-Defamation League CEO and national director Jonathan Greenblatt, recognize this and have endorsed the executive order.
Left-wing groups like J Street and the anti-Zionist IfNotNow oppose it. The latter is apparently worried that the thuggish behavior of their anti-Semitic allies in the ranks of Students for Justice in Palestine and on college faculties will now actually be held accountable for their actions.
It’s not surprising that anti-Zionists don’t wish to acknowledge that although Jews are not a race or a specific nation under American law, they are more than merely a faith. Jewish peoplehood is not an invention of white supremacists; it is integral to Jewish identity. But if the goal is to deny Jews rights that are given to any other group – as is the case with anti-Semites – then efforts like those of Trump to defend Jews being attacked, marginalized, silence and shunned on campus must be denounced.
The knee-jerk reaction of so many left-wingers to this move says more about them than the president. Trump’s order, as well as his administration’s exemplary policies about anti-Semitism and support for Israel, doesn’t obligate anyone to vote for him. But if you are so crazed by hatred that you reject or denounce actions that clearly help young Jews, then you are the one with the problem, not him.

Texto completo: The House of Representatives impeached President Trump, and at long last, some Democratic members of the House and plenty of progressive activists got what they've wanted since January 2017.
Naturally, however, that's not enough. With removal from office as likely as there being a faraway world with munchkins, yellow brick roads, and flying monkeys, Trump, not Vice President Mike Pence, will serve as president until at least January 2021.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said there was almost zero chance Trump gets removed, and Sen. Lindsey Graham said he would vote to acquit Trump. As such, some are all agog, saying, "How dare you, sir?" They want House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to engage in one last desperate scheme: not sending the articles of impeachment to the Senate.
Latching on to this odd idea are the likes of Harvard Law Professor Laurence Tribe, Democratic superstar Michael Avenatti, former Florida lobbyist and congressman David Jolly, former Breitbart flack Kurt Bardella, and others. The idea is that holding onto the articles to demand that McConnell commit to an "open and fair trial" will put pressure on senators in swing states facing reelection in 2020 to follow suit. That list includes Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Cory Gardner of Colorado, and Martha McSally of Arizona, to name a few.
The only thing missing from this idea is the scheduling of the clown-shoe fitting for those advocating for this desperation move.
The major problem in this latest scheme to get Trump out of office is that the House has no say over how the Senate conducts an impeachment trial. If McConnell wants to pay homage to the O.J. Simpson trial and have the Dancing Itos perform for everyone and serve as witnesses, he can do that. The revered Constitution gives the Senate "sole power to try all impeachments." That means it’s McConnell's gig.
When Republicans offered up complaints about the House impeachment process, the chorus of "Deal with it!" echoed from the halls of Congress to the television studios of CNN and MSNBC and the newsrooms of the Washington Post and the New York Times.
What goes around comes around, I suppose.
I've said many times, both publicly and in private, that public opinion would have to shift in a significant way for there to be a chance to get a simple majority in the Senate to vote for removal, let alone the requisite two-thirds majority. That figure would have to be 66% or higher. As it stands, the RealClearPolitics polling for impeachment and removal is at 47%, with those opposing at 48%.
It won't make much of a difference because once again, the commentariat and other insiders don't get that people aren't sitting around saying, "Well, Cory Gardner won't put pressure on Mitch McConnell to offer up a fair impeachment trial, so I am definitely voting against him!"
If reverence for the Constitution and the oath senators take are so sacrosanct, perhaps they should reach out to some Democrats, including Democratic presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren, Amy Klobuchar, and Michael Bennett. All have implied they'd vote to convict Trump even before the impeachment articles passed the House.
The "hold the articles" gambit is a terrific example of Washington insider nonsense that is a nonstarter in the hinterlands or even the suburbs. The idea will fail, and McConnell will sit back smiling and think of Napoleon Bonaparte, who said, "Never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake."

Texto completo: Readers discussed the president's scathing letter to Speaker Nancy Pelosi as the House vote approached.
To the Editor:
Re "House Votes to Impeach Trump for Abuse of Power" (nytimes.com, Dec. 18):
President Trump has a knack for destroying the reputations and legitimacy of the people he works with. Now, with the impeachment of Mr. Trump moving from indictment in the House to a trial in the Senate, it seems the same corrosive effect will continue.
The Senate will act as jury, but Mitch McConnell has already proclaimed openly that he needs no further testimony and that he is coordinating the Senate actions with the desires and demands of the White House. In other words, the jury is collaborating with the defendant.
I expected no less from Mr. McConnell. But what about Chief Justice John Roberts? When the chief justice of the United States presides over a sham, what sort of judge is he? What sort of country do we live in?

To the Editor:
Re "Trump's 6-Page Diatribe Belittles Impeachment as an 'Attempted Coup"' (front page, Dec. 18):
President Trump has once again acted to subvert Congress and the separation of powers with his nonsensical and ridiculous letter to Nancy Pelosi. He has confirmed what every critic of his has been saying for the last four years -- that he is unhinged, ill qualified and actively seeking to interfere in the democratic system of government. He is living in an alternate reality. How can anyone defend his actions?
He is making a mockery of America on the world's stage. His hypocritical actions just confirm how unfit he is for office. His impeachment is not enough; the Senate should vote for his removal.
Natalie Cardamone
Media, Pa.
To the Editor:
President Trump, in his intemperate letter to Speaker Nancy Pelosi, makes this statement: "So you have spent three straight years attempting to overturn the will of the American people and nullify their votes."
Mr. Trump overlooks the fact that almost three million more citizens voted against him than voted for him. He became president because of a quaint 18th-century quirk in the Constitution, not because the people elected him. We did not.
Further, even unseating the president would not be a nullification of the electoral vote. We would still have an elected Republican president in office.
Roger Bullard
Wilson, N.C.
To the Editor:
President Trump, in his angry letter to Nancy Pelosi, accuses the Democrats of many of the things that he is being accused of, such as "interfering in America's elections" and "subverting America's Democracy." I have heard this argument before -- in kindergarten. It's a version of the classic "I'm not stupid -- you're stupid!"
It is the argument of a simplistic, guilty man. Plain and simple.

To the Editor:
It may or may not be that President Trump pressured Ukraine for political advantage, or held up military aid toward that end. Whether that would rise to the level of an impeachable offense, or merit something less draconian such as censure, is another question. All of that doesn't address the larger issue, however, which is that partisan Democrats have been looking for some reason to "get" Mr. Trump and undo the 2016 election since Day 1.
Their motives are impure, and therefore the process lacks credibility. If it hadn't been Ukraine, it would have been something else. The daily drumbeat of negativity toward this president for the past three years, led, frankly, by your newspaper, has been notable.
The poisonous partisan divide in this country dates back to the Robert Bork Supreme Court confirmation hearings in 1987, and has been fed since then by the enduring conceit of liberals that only they have received wisdom, and all other thought is politically incorrect. This intellectual arrogance is at the root of the problem.

To the Editor:
Every time I hear Republicans insist that impeachment is an attempt to overturn an election, I want to say: "There was an election in 2018, too, and Democrats overwhelmingly won the House -- without the help of any Russians. That election, which could be viewed as a referendum on the president, counts too!"

Rapper Tekashi 6ix9ine given a 2-year sentence

Texto completo: Rapper Tekashi 6ix9ine has been sentenced to two years in prison over racketeering charges stemming from his affiliation with the street gang Nine Trey Gangsta Bloods, according to the Associated Press.
The sentence, delivered Wednesday in U.S. District Court, is substantially shorter than the maximum 47 years previously faced by the 23-year-old rapper, whose real name is Daniel Hernandez. Judge Paul Engelmayer attributed the leniency to Hernandez's working with prosecutors throughout the 13 months he has already served. 'Your cooperation was impressive,' Engelmayer reportedly said. 'It was game-changing. It was complete and it was brave.'
Last week, Hernandez wrote the judge a letter expressing remorse over the crimes he committed.
'I was blessed with a gift of an opportunity that most people dream of but I squandered it by getting involved with the wrong people and misrepresenting myself when I should have been true to myself and my fans,' Hernandez stated, reflecting on his decision to align himself with the gang.
The New York Times reported in September that Hernandez joined the Nine Trey in 2017 to earn 'a stamp of street authenticity that would guarantee musical stardom.' He broke out that year when an Instagram selfie " featuring multiple face tattoos reading '69,' as well as his rainbow hair and grill " went viral on social media, drawing attention to his debut song 'Gummo,' released a few months later. The single hit No. 12 on the Billboard Hot 100, and he reached No. 3 the next summer with the track 'Fefe,' a collaboration with Nicki Minaj.
Hernandez became one of the most popular rappers on SoundCloud, the streaming service that also gave rise to artists such as Lil Pump and XXXTentacion. But like the latter, who died last year, Hernandez's success was mired in controversy from the start: In 2015, he pleaded guilty to one felony count of sexual misconduct involving a 13-year-old girl, for which he eventually received four years' probation.
Though his music career continued to thrive, Hernandez's legal troubles worsened in 2018. That January, he allegedly assaulted a fan. In May, he was charged with two misdemeanors for operating a vehicle without a license and, the next day, reportedly attacked a New York police officer. In November, Hernandez was indicted on the federal charges that led to his Wednesday sentencing.
Geoffrey S. Berman, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a statement at the time that the Nine Trey had 'wreaked havoc on New York City, engaging in brazen acts of violence.' The indictment alleged that Hernandez had participated in an April 2018 robbery of rival gang members and that he had been among a group that agreed to shoot someone who had disrespected the Nine Trey.
In February, Hernandez pleaded guilty to nine counts of racketeering conspiracy, firearms offenses and narcotics trafficking. He cut a deal with federal prosecutors and, in September, took the stand as a star witness against high-ranking Nine Trey members Aljermiah Mack and Anthony Ellison, both of whom now face life in prison. Hernandez, who has since renounced his Nine Trey affiliation, was derided as a 'S.N.I.T.C.H.' by rapper Snoop Dogg, who also pointed out that his close friend Martha Stewart 'snitched on NOT ONE soul' before serving five months for lying about a stock sale. Vince Staples, a rapper known for his outspoken nature, tweeted, 'Did 69 tell on you? Find out next time, on Dragon Ball Z.'
Prosecutors have indicated that Hernandez could enter a witness protection program after his release from prison, though that could prove difficult given the prominence of his unusual face tattoos. In a presentencing letter to the judge, they wrote that the rapper's help 'was extraordinary' and that there is 'no question that the defendant's life will never be the same because of his cooperation in this case.'
'He and his family will have to take extra safety precautions when being in public so as to avoid potential reprisals from others,' prosecutors continued, per the Associated Press.
Hernandez's representatives haven't responded to The Washington Post's request for comment.

China flouts federal law as American newspapers push communist regime propaganda

Texto completo: Democracy dies in piles and piles of blood-soaked cash.

The Chinese government has, for decades, paid major American newsrooms, including the Washington Post, the New York Times, and the Wall Street Journal, to publish propaganda produced by China Daily, the official mouthpiece of the communist regime, according to an investigative report by the Washington Free Beacon.

In the process, China has also circumvented federal law requiring that foreign entities provide a full accounting of all stateside expenditures and activities.

“China Daily has run more than 700 online ads designed to look like news articles and purchased 500 print pages in six American newspapers over the last seven years,” according to the Washington Free Beacon, which reviewed all of the physical copies of pro-China ads filed with the U.S. Department of Justice as well as those that were not submitted. "China Daily uses its large war chest to purchase hundreds of ads in the print and online versions of the Times, Post, and Journal. Ad spending peaked in 2016, when it took out ads in more than 140 pages in American outlets."

The report adds, “These propaganda articles frame state oppression in Xinjiang, Tibet, and Hong Kong in a positive light and run alongside actual news stories produced by reporters at the Post, Times, Wall Street Journal, and other outlets.”

An ad that ran in the Wall Street Journal in March, for example, described the incarceration of an estimated one million Muslim Uighurs in Xinjiang concentration camps as a "law-based campaign of de-radicalization.” Other ads that have run in the Washington Post describe China’s occupation of Tibet in positive terms, including a 2013 article titled, "Harmony rules in Tibet's Catholic town."

China Daily registered as a foreign agent in 1983. However, it would be 29 years before it formally disclosed its business ties to American newsrooms.

“Even after [China Daily] began acknowledging its relationship with the papers, the regime mouthpiece continued to violate federal disclosure requirements," according to the report. "China Daily has failed to provide breakdowns of spending activities and withheld copies of online ads, among other omissions that violate federal law, according to experts who reviewed years of its [Foreign Agent Registration Act] filings."

Federal law requires that foreign entities provide the Justice Department with copies of all propaganda materials "disseminated or circulated among two or more persons" in the United States. In many cases, China Daily did not do this, according to the report. Moreover, even though the communist ads published by American newsrooms contain the legally required disclaimers notifying readers that they were prepared by a Chinese entity, there is nothing to indicate that the ads were prepared specifically by the official propaganda arm of the Chinese Communist Party.

As of November, China Daily continues to ignore U.S. federal law, according to the Washington Free Beacon. A review of the Chinese outlet’s most recent filing shows it "illegally lumps together all expenditures under two vague categories: 'Total Cost of Goods Sold' and 'Operation Expenses.' China Daily should have broken down its expenditures, detailing how much money it paid to each outlet for each ad purchase,” the report notes, citing two experts on the matter.

The Washington Post has published China Daily ads for “more than 30 years,” a spokesman for the American newspaper said. A representative for the Washington Post also defended its history of publishing Chinese agitprop, saying it gives "wide latitude" to advertisers so long as they don’t run afoul of the law.

A spokesman for the Wall Street Journal said in a statement to the Washington Examiner, "We accept a wide range of advertisements, including those with provocative viewpoints. We require all ads to be clearly and properly identified as such, and, if an ad is advertorial, we add additional labeling to make clear the newsroom was not involved in its content or creation. The varied and divergent views expressed belong to the advertisers."

A spokeswoman for the New York Times defended its promotion of China Daily ads, telling the Washington Examiner that it “covers China thoroughly and aggressively, and at no time has advertising influenced our coverage.”

"In fact,” the person added, “the publication of this story in 2012 on the hidden wealth of the family of China’s prime minister resulted in the Times being blocked on all platforms in mainland China, which continues to this day.”

“We’re committed to reporting on China, and fund our Chinese-language site and bureaus in Beijing and Shanghai (as well as Hong Kong) at a significant cost,” she continued. “We also continue to cover China fearlessly. Our recent investigation based on more than 400 pages of leaked internal Chinese documents provided an unprecedented look into the government’s crackdown on ethnic minorities in the Xinjiang region.”

Representatives for the Post did not respond to requests for comment.

Hong Kong Is Still Free; China Can Be; From investors to soccer fans to academics, a conviction that the loss of liberty is not inevitable.

Texto completo: It's looking like a bad day for the communist bullies of Beijing. Despite the best efforts of the Chinese dictatorship, the people of Hong Kong remain free. And even on the Chinese mainland some brave souls are asserting their basic liberties.
A new report helps explain why Hong Kong protesters are so courageous in demanding that the Chinese government keep its promise to allow citizens of the former British colony to enjoy the rights they have long enjoyed. Hong Kongers have more to lose from oppressive government than almost anyone in the world.
The latest Human Freedom Index rates Hong Kong as the world's freest economy and third most free country overall. The U.S. ranks 15th and China checks in at an abysmal 126th, 12 spots behind Russia. The index is co-published by the Cato Institute, the Fraser Institute in Canada and the Liberales Institut at the Friedrich Naumann Foundation for Freedom in Germany.
The season of protests has helped push Hong Kong into its first recession since the financial crisis. But a recent rally in Hong Kong shares suggests that this great jewel of the world economy has not suffered irreparable damage.
Meanwhile citizens of the former colony are sharing the message of freedom well beyond their borders today. In Busan, South Korea, China has defeated Hong Kong 2-0 in a regional soccer tournament, but the Hong Kongers in attendance remain unbowed. The Journal's Eun-Young Jeong reports:
The protest chants would have rung familiar on the streets of Hong Kong. "Fight for freedom! Stand with Hong Kong!" they shouted...
When the Chinese national anthem, the March of the Volunteers, played before the game, dozens of Hong Kong fans booed and turned their backs to the field. Some held up their middle finger. One man held up a banner that read "Hong Kong is not China," and was approached by security guards to take it down.
As soon as the game started at Busan Asiad Main Stadium, the Hong Kong fans belted out "Glory to Hong Kong" in Cantonese, a song that has become the protesters' de facto anthem.
Over on the Chinese mainland, the communist government's effort to expand its control over all institutions of society is meeting some resistance. Strange as it may sound to American ears, university faculty and administrators are pushing back against politicized education. The Journal's Philip Wen reports from Beijing:
Amendments to the charters of three Chinese universities that place absolute adherence to Communist Party rule over academic independence have provoked heated online debate and prompted some prominent academics to raise concerns amid a backdrop of tightening ideological control on China's campuses.
References to academic independence and freedom of thought were stripped out of the charter of Shanghai's prestigious Fudan University, long-considered one of the country's most liberal academic institutions.
Substituted were references to "serving the governance of the Communist Party" and "dedication to patriotism," according to a notice posted on the website of China's Ministry of Education...
"If we do not speak out today about such a blatant challenge to the bottom line of education and academic ethics, I am afraid we will never have the chance," said Lu Xiaoping, vice-president of the literature school at Nanjing University—another university whose charter was rewritten—in a Weibo post on Wednesday that was... later deleted. Shaanxi Normal University, in northwestern China, was the third university to have its charter altered.
Mr. Wen adds that "footage purportedly of Fudan students gathering in a university cafeteria to sing the school anthem circulated on Chinese social media on Wednesday afternoon. The lyrics include the reference to 'academic independence and freedom of thought' once enshrined in the university charter."
Communist party strongman Xi Jinping says China's university campuses should become "strongholds of the party's leadership." Faculty resisters may not be able to draw much inspiration from their U.S. academic counterparts. But liberty advocates in both China and Hong Kong are surely an inspiration to millions of Americans.

Bottom Stories of the Day
Other Than That, The Story Was Accurate The Washington Post makes an interesting editing choice on an op-ed by Robert Pianta, dean of the University of Virginia Curry School of Education and Human Development. "The one education reform that would really help? Giving public schools more money," reads the headline. The secondary headline of the piece reads, "The one thing we haven't tried in the past 30 years is sufficiently investing in our schools."
Then the text of the piece begins: "Correction: An earlier version of this piece stated that, adjusting for constant dollars, public funding for schools had decreased since the late 1980s. This is not the case. In fact, funding at the federal, state and local levels has increased between the 1980s and 2019."

Texto completo: Dozens of his alleged sexual misconduct victims would split the payout and a large part of the money would flow to the attorneys.
"What's the right recompense for these kinds of allegations?"
-- Jodi Kantor, an investigative reporter at The New York Times

Katherine Kendall, a 50-year-old actress, accused Harvey Weinstein of luring her, in 1993, to what she thought would be a work discussion and then chasing her around his New York apartment while he was nude.
Now she is one of dozens of alleged sexual misconduct victims who, after two years of legal wrangling, were nearing a tentative $ 25 million settlement this week with the disgraced Hollywood producer.
The deal would not require that he admit any wrongdoing or pay anything himself to the more than 30 victims -- actresses and former Weinstein employees in the U.S., Canada, Britain and Ireland -- who have accused him of offenses ranging from sexual harassment to rape.
And while many of them were disappointed with the end result, a lawyer representing one plaintiff said that holding out for more favorable terms might have left the alleged victims completely empty-handed.
Kendall said she agreed to the terms of the deal partly because she didn't want to block fellow plaintiffs from getting whatever recompense they could. "I don't love it," she said. "But I don't know how to go after him."
I caught up with Megan Twohey and Jodi Kantor -- the New York Times journalists who broke the Weinstein story in 2017 and authors of "She Said: Breaking the Sexual Harassment Story That Helped Ignite a Movement" (Read it!) -- to take a closer look at the settlement and discuss what comes next.
A $ 25 million payout shared between dozens of victims doesn't sound like a lot. Why do they get so little?
Jodi: What's the right recompense for these kinds of allegations? It's a hard question. Consider that a single one of [former Fox News host] Bill O'Reilly's accusers was paid $ 32 million, while in this tentative civil settlement, dozens or more of Weinstein's accusers will split the $ 25 million.
And a sizable chunk of that will flow into the pockets of the attorneys who represented the plaintiffs.
Megan: At one point, Weinstein's accusers were told they would receive as much as $ 90 million but that amount kept shrinking once Weinstein's company filed for bankruptcy, forcing the women to get in line with the company's creditors, and Weinstein has claimed that he was on the verge of filing for personal bankruptcy.
Will any of this money come from Weinstein's pocket?
Megan: Under this agreement, Weinstein and the board members of his bankrupt company are not required to pay any money to his alleged victims. All of the money for the settlement is coming from The Weinstein Company insurance policies. The insurance companies are also covering a portion of the legal costs for Weinstein and the board members.
Some people have been shocked and dismayed that insurance companies are paying for Weinstein's alleged sexual harassment and abuse -- but this is the way insurance policies work. In fact, some specifically cover sexual harassment.
You mention in the story that another trial on charges of sexual assault involving two women is scheduled for late January. Tell us more about that case. And why aren't they part of this original settlement?
Megan: There are two separate tracks by which Weinstein can be held legally accountable, one civil, one criminal. This tentative settlement involves dozens of women from around the world who are seeking financial recompense under civil law for the alleged sexual misconduct they suffered. Separately, Weinstein is being prosecuted here in New York for allegedly sexually assaulting two women. This case is an attempt to hold Weinstein accountable under criminal law. If convicted, he will go to prison.
The trial is scheduled to begin January 6. The two alleged victims would not be able to bring civil lawsuits against Weinstein until the criminal case is resolved.
So does this basically mean that Weinstein goes unpunished? Is he essentially off the hook?
Jodi: No, because of that criminal trial that's about to start. But it means that the separate, much broader attempt of dozens of women to hold him accountable is coming to an ambiguous resolution.
What surprised you the most when reporting this story?
Jodi: The more interesting question may be what surprised others. Ever since we published earlier this week, readers have been asking us: Wait, insurance can cover sexual harassment and even assault? And Weinstein can wipe these claims away, without reaching into his own pocket to pay the victims?
Readers: Fair? Unfair? Surprising? Inevitable? Write in and tell us your views on the resolution of the civil lawsuits against Harvey Weinstein.

'Twas Christmas on the Hill, and with it came impeachment

Texto completo: President Bill Clinton stood at a lectern in the Rose Garden, surrounded by supporters, including his wife, first lady Hillary Clinton. The votes had been counted, and the news had arrived: He was being impeached.
'I hope there will be a constitutional and fair means of resolving this matter in a prompt manner,' he said. 'Meanwhile, I will continue to do the work of the American people.'
He decried the 'excessive partisanship' and 'obsessive animosity' of the day. Then he turned around, shook hands, walked back into the White House and threw a Christmas party.
In an amazing episode of 'history repeats itself,' the House is expected to vote to impeach President Trump on Dec. 18 " one day short of the 21st anniversary of the House voting to impeach Clinton on Dec. 19, 1998. Both arrived awkwardly in the holiday season known for 'glad tidings' and 'goodwill toward men.'
Clinton wasn't the only one attempting holiday merriment that day in 1998. In the Capitol, Rep. Henry J. Hyde (R-Ill.), who chaired the House Judiciary Committee overseeing the impeachment at the time, scheduled the committee's holiday party for the same time as the impeachment vote. (The vote was later moved from Thursday to Saturday.)
Some Democrats were offended by the double-booking, the New York Times reported.
'It should do wonders for holiday cheer,' Rep. William D. Delahunt (D-Mass.) said sarcastically.
In the halls of the Capitol, CNN correspondent Bob Franken struggled to be heard on-air over a boombox blasting 'O Tannenbaum.'
And it wasn't just Dec. 19 when impeachment and the holidays intertwined. Ten days earlier, at the very moment Clinton lit the National Christmas Tree, House Republicans unveiled their four articles of impeachment against the president. (Only two were passed by the House.)
It was a bit different this time. On Dec. 5, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) announced she was asking Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, to proceed with articles of impeachment. It was the same day as Trump's tree lighting, but she made her speech seven hours before the event, not during.
And there was additional drama with the Clinton impeachment. Moments before the impeachment vote, House Speaker-elect Bob Livingston (R-La.) announced he would not replace outgoing Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) after all. Hustler magazine had just announced it had information that Livingston had had at least four extramarital affairs.
Though the scene on the Hill may have been surreal, life " and Christmas cheer " went on in most of the United States. Local papers across the country widely reported that holiday shoppers weren't bringing up impeachment, and when asked, they mostly responded with a mix of apathy and disgust.
'Mississippians ignore impeachment, finish Christmas shopping instead,' announced a Clarion-Ledger headline.
'I think we have better things to worry about in this country than [Clinton's] personal life,' a Racine, Wis., shopper said to the Journal Times.
'You know what's funny? I went to two Christmas parties last night and no one was talking about impeachment,' an Ohio Republican told the New York Times. 'They talked about whether the [Cleveland] Indians should go after Roger Clemens.'
'Impeachment is old news,' one shopper told the Philadelphia Inquirer. She added that she was more interested in decorating her house for the holidays.
Even right across the Potomac, at the Fashion Centre at Pentagon City, shoppers told The Washington Post that, by and large, they were neither interested nor offended that impeachment was happening in the season to be jolly.
'Things happen all times in the year,' a Navy commander bah-humbugged to The Post. 'The fact that it's Christmas doesn't make any difference.'
But a young mall worker at a politically themed shop noted there was a holiday rush for 'the Ken Starr report on toilet paper' and a parody CD of a Clinton impersonator singing bawdy tunes.
Earlier this month, Gingrich, the former speaker who presided over the vote, complained on Fox News that 'on the eve of Christmas, it is really sad' to see Democrats displaying such 'partisanship' " seeming to forget that at Christmastime 21 years ago, he was doing the same.

Trump's crime in progress

Texto completo: It was as though an accused white-collar criminal, during jury selection for his bribery trial, had offered the judge a briefcase full of unmarked bills.
Or as though a drug offender, taking the stand to defend himself against charges that he trafficked in narcotics, had tried to sell a brick of cocaine to the jury foreman.
But it really happened. Even as the House on Tuesday worked out the rules of the debate that will almost certainly see President Trump impeached by Wednesday night , Trump and his team continued to commit the very offenses for which he is being punished.
As the Rules Committee moved to the floor an impeachment article alleging Trump had abused his office by soliciting foreign help for his reelection campaign, Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, boasted to CNN that Trump is 'very supportive' of Giuliani's ongoing efforts to dig up political dirt in Ukraine that would help with Trump's reelection campaign.
'We're on the same page,' a defiant Giuliani, fresh from a dirt-seeking trip to Ukraine, said of Trump. 'Just in case you think we're on defense, we're not.'
It was the latest stop on Giuliani's media tour " of Fox News, the New Yorker, the New York Times and The Post " boasting about Trump's active engagement in Giuliani's attempts to get dirt on Joe Biden and to bulldoze, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's help, U.S. officials who stand in their way.
The moment Giuliani's plane touched down from Ukraine last week, he said, Trump called him to ask, 'What did you get?' He boasted that he forced out corruption-fighting ambassador Marie Yovanovitch because he needed her 'out of the way.' He says he's writing up a 20-page report full of the dirt he has dug for Trump.
And Trump doesn't disagree. 'He does this out of love, believe me,' the president said of Giuliani on Monday.
In response, Democrats must show their love, too " of the rule of law, the sanctity of elections and democracy itself " by impeaching this recidivist president. Trump continues to cheat in the 2020 election.
'We present you not just with high crimes and misdemeanors but a constitutional crime in progress up to this very minute,' Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), representing the House Judiciary Committee, testified to the Rules Committee. Referring to Giuliani's latest boasts, he added that Giuliani, 'fresh from his overseas travel looking to rehabilitate once again the discredited conspiracy theories at the heart of the president's defense, admitted that he participated directly in the smear campaign to oust Ambassador Yovanovitch.'
Other Democrats on the panel picked up the theme. 'I look at this as a crime in progress, and we're trying to stop the president from rigging the next election,' said Rep. Jim McGovern (Mass.), the committee chairman.
The Rules Committee, which meets in a tiny hearing room on the third floor of the Capitol, is a last haven for congeniality. McGovern gave the ranking Republican, Tom Cole (Okla.), unlimited time to present his case. 'I'm very liberal,' the Democrat explained.
'In the finest sense of the word,' Cole agreed.
When Cole finally finished, 45 minutes later, McGovern quipped: 'You're going to make me into a conservative.'
Before the hearing, McGovern and Rep. Doug Collins (Ga.), assigned to make the case against impeachment, exchanged a smile. 'Livin' the dream,' Collins said.
But when the camera went on, Collins resumed his usual posture, accusing the Democrats of 'abuse,' 'fiction,' 'last- minute Christmas shopping,' a 'kangaroo court' and 'Alice in Wonderland' proceedings. Collins opposed not just Trump's impeachment but also Andrew Johnson's. (Congress 'set him up,' he said.)
McGovern said he was shocked by Republicans' 'inability to acknowledge that President Trump acted improperly.' The chairman asked Collins whether he thinks it acceptable for a president to ask a foreign country to investigate an American citizen.
'Nothing wrong with the call,' Collins replied.
This followed Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-Tex.) saying last week: 'Is it ever okay to invite a foreign government to become involved in an election involving a political opponent? The answer is yes. . . . We do it all the time.'
Trump sure does. At the Rules Committee hearing, Raskin returned several times to Giuliani's boasts about his ongoing efforts to find political dirt for Trump in Ukraine. 'Given that he and his team are still awaiting President Zelensky's statement about investigating Joe Biden, given that he has already invited China to perform an investigation of its own, we can only ask what the 2020 election will be like,' he said.
And Republicans ask why Democrats don't wait for that election " the very election in which Trump is trying to cheat " instead of impeaching him? Or don't wait " likely until after the election " for the dispute to make its way through the courts?
As Trump once said: Talk to Rudy.

Texto completo: Nobody, not Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, or even Barack Obama, plays a president better than Donald Trump, according to the dean of the White House news photographers.
“Donald Trump is the most iconic,” said Doug Mills of the New York Times, the president’s favorite photographer.
In a CBS Morning News feature, Chief Washington Correspondent Major Garrett asked the longtime White House photographer what it is about Trump that makes for good pictures.
Mills didn’t hesitate. “Obviously, his hair, obviously, how big he is, and just his eyes,” said Mills, adding, “Just about everything about him.”
Tweet
For pretty photos, he said, Obama wins. “Barack Obama was the most photogenic,” he said.
But Trump offers so much more, in part because he is extremely accessible to photographers and appreciates their work.
“His emotions are right out there,” said Mills. He recalled one meeting he observed during which Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer were fighting over the budget, and everybody was waving their hands.
“It felt uncomfortable because I thought that at any moment, we should just leave this conversation, yet that’s part of Donald Trump,” said Mills.
Mills is also acclaimed for his photograph this year capturing Pelosi's sarcastic applause during Trump's State of the Union address.
Garrett noted that Trump has called Mills in to special meetings because he values his eye. Once, at an international economic meeting, Trump pointed Mills out to the other leaders and said, “He’s a genius; unfortunately, he works for the New York Times.”

Texto completo: President Bill Clinton stood at a lectern in the Rose Garden, surrounded by supporters, including his wife, first lady Hillary Clinton. The votes had been counted, and the news had arrived: He was being impeached.
"I hope there will be a constitutional and fair means of resolving this matter in a prompt manner," he said. "Meanwhile, I will continue to do the work of the American people."
He decried the "excessive partisanship" and "obsessive animosity" of the day. Then he turned around, shook hands, walked back into the White House and threw a Christmas party.
In an amazing episode of "history repeats itself," the House is expected to vote to impeach President Trump on Dec. 18 — one day short of the 21st anniversary of the House voting to impeach Clinton on Dec. 19, 1998.
And it wasn't just Dec. 19 where impeachment and the holidays intertwined. Ten days earlier, at the very moment Clinton lit the National Christmas Tree, House Republicans unveiled their four articles of impeachment against the president. (Only two were passed by the House.)
It was a little bit different this time. On Dec. 5, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat from California, announced she was asking Representative Jerrold Nadler, a New York Democrat, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, to proceed with articles of impeachment. It was the same day as Trump's tree lighting, but she made her speech seven hours before the event, not during. Earlier this month, Newt Gingrich, the former speaker who presided over the Clinton impeachment vote, complained on Fox News that "on the eve of Christmas, it is really sad" to see Democrats displaying such "partisanship" — seeming to forget that at Christmastime 21 years ago, he was doing the same.

Democratic debate on after parties reach labor accord
LOS ANGELES — The next Democratic presidential debate will go on as scheduled Thursday, after negotiators Tuesday reached agreement in a labor dispute that had threatened to upend the event while highlighting the influence that organized labor wields with the leading Democratic presidential candidates.
The debate, which will be held at Loyola Marymount University, had been in question since last week after the seven participating Democrats each said they would not cross a picket line, if there was one.
The dispute, between a cafeteria workers union and a food services company at Loyola Marymount, involved only about 150 workers and had drawn little notice over nine months. Yet in the heated political atmosphere surrounding the 2020 Democratic presidential contest, the impasse attracted outsized attention this month as the sixth primary debate approached.
Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez worked with the union, UNITE HERE Local 11; their employer, food services provider Sodexo; and other local officials. The two sides resumed negotiations Monday and announced a tentative agreement Tuesday morning.

Trump aide Gates is sentenced to 45 day in jail
WASHINGTON — Former deputy Trump campaign chairman Rick Gates was sentenced to 45 days in jail Tuesday despite crimes that could have put him in prison for five or six years after offering what prosecutors described as extraordinary cooperation with Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe.
Gates can serve the sentence on weekends, US District Judge Amy Berman Jackson said. Gates, who will be on probation for three years, must pay a $20,000 fine and perform 300 hours of community service.
In sentencing Gates, Jackson said she struggled to balance his crimes with the vital "evidence about matters of grave and international importance" he offered federal prosecutors.
"Gates' information alone warranted, even demanded further investigation from the standpoint of national security, the integrity of our elections, and enforcing criminal laws," Jackson said.
A globe-trotting lobbyist who for a decade served as a right-hand man to former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, Gates, 47, pleaded guilty in February 2018 to lying to the FBI and conspiring to conceal tens of millions of dollars earned from lucrative lobbying work he and Manafort had done for Ukraine.
He went on to testify against Manafort, and two others in cases stemming from the probe into whether any Americans conspired with Russian efforts to influence the 2016 election.

President says he'll attend Davos economic event in '20
President Trump is planning to attend next year's World Economic Forum in Davos, according to four administration officials, after skipping the last such event during a partial US government shutdown.
The trip to Switzerland, a Jan. 21-24 gathering of business and political elites, will be an opportunity for Trump to tout his economic record ahead of the 2020 election.

Methane Leak, Seen From Space, Proves to Be Far Larger Than Thought

Texto completo: The first satellite designed to continuously monitor the planet for methane leaks made a startling discovery last year: A little known gas-well accident at an Ohio fracking site was in fact one of the largest methane leaks ever recorded in the United States.
The findings by a Dutch-American team of scientists, published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, mark a step forward in using space technology to detect leaks of methane, a potent greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming, from oil and gas sites worldwide.
The scientists said the new findings reinforced the view that methane releases like these, which are difficult to predict, could be far more widespread than previously thought.
"We're entering a new era. With a single observation, a single overpass, we're able to see plumes of methane coming from large emission sources," said Ilse Aben, an expert in satellite remote sensing and one of the authors of the new research. "That's something totally new that we were previously not able to do from space."
Scientists also said the new findings reinforced the view that methane emissions from oil installations are far more widespread than previously thought.
The blowout, in February 2018 at a natural gas well run by an Exxon Mobil subsidiary in Belmont County, Ohio, released more methane than the entire oil and gas industries of many nations do in a year, the research team found. The Ohio episode triggered about 100 residents within a one-mile radius to evacuate their homes while workers scrambled to plug the well.
At the time, the Exxon subsidiary, XTO Energy, said it could not immediately determine how much gas had leaked. But the European Space Agency had just launched a satellite with a new monitoring instrument called Tropomi, designed to collect more accurate measurements of methane.
"We said, 'Can we see it? Let's look,"' said Steven Hamburg, a New York-based scientist with the Environmental Defense Fund, which had been collaborating on the satellite project with researchers at the Netherlands Institute for Space Research in Utrecht, the Netherlands.
Natural gas production has come under increased scrutiny because of the prevalence of leaks of methane -- the colorless, odorless main component of natural gas -- from the fuel's supply chain.
When burned for electricity, natural gas is cleaner than coal, producing about half the carbon dioxide that coal does. But if methane escapes into the atmosphere before being burned, it can warm the planet more than 80 times as much as the same amount of carbon dioxide over a 20-year period.
The satellite's measurements showed that, in Ohio in the 20 days it took for Exxon to plug the well, about 120 metric tons of methane an hour were released. That amounted to twice the rate of the largest known methane leak in the United States, from an oil and gas storage facility in Aliso Canyon, Calif., in 2015, though that event lasted longer and had higher emissions overall.
The Ohio blowout released more methane than the reported emissions of the oil and gas industries of countries like Norway and France, the researchers estimated. Scientists said the measurements from the Ohio site could mean that other large leaks are going undetected.
"When I started working on methane, now about a decade ago, the standard line was: 'We've got it under control. We're managing it,"' Dr. Hamburg said. "But in fact, they didn't have the data. They didn't have it under control, because they didn't understand what was actually happening. And you can't manage what you don't measure."
An Exxon spokesman, Casey Norton, said that the company's own scientists had scrutinized images and taken pressure readings from the well to arrive at a smaller estimate of the emissions from the blowout. Exxon is in touch with the satellite researchers, Mr. Norton said, and has "agreed to sit down and talk further to understand the discrepancy and see if there's anything that we can learn."
"This was an anomaly," he said. "This is not something that happens on any regular basis. And we do our very best to prevent this from ever happening."
An internal investigation found that high pressure had caused the well's casing, or internal lining, to fail, Mr. Norton said. After working with Ohio regulators on safety improvements, he said, the well is now in service.
Miranda Leppla, head of energy policy at the Ohio Environmental Council, said there had been complaints about health issues -- throat irritation, dizziness, breathing problems -- among residents closest to the well.
"Methane emissions, unfortunately, aren't a rare occurrence, but a constant threat that exacerbates climate change and can damage the health of Ohioans," she said.
Scientists said that a critical task was now to be more quickly able to sift through the tens of millions of data points the satellite collects each day to identify methane hot spots. Studies of oil fields in the United States have shown that a small number of sites with high emissions are responsible for the bulk of methane releases.
So far, detecting and measuring methane leaks has involved expensive field studies using aircraft and infrared cameras that make the invisible gas visible. In a visual investigation published last week, The New York Times used airborne measurement equipment and advanced infrared cameras to expose six so-called super emitters in a West Texas oil field.
In a separate paper published in October, researchers detailed the use of two satellites to detect and measure a longer-term leak of methane from a natural gas compressor station in Turkmenistan, in Central Asia. Researchers estimated emissions from the site to be roughly comparable to the overall release from the Aliso Canyon event.
The leak has now stopped, satellite readings show, after the researchers raised the alarm through diplomatic channels.
"That's the strength of satellites. We can look almost everywhere in the world," said Dr. Aben, a senior scientist at the Dutch space institute in Utrecht and an author on both papers.
There are limitations to hunting for methane leaks with satellite technology. Satellites cannot see beneath clouds. Scientists must also do complex calculations to account for the background methane that already exists in the earth's atmosphere.
Still, satellites will increasingly be able to both rapidly detect large releases and shed light on the rise in methane levels in the atmosphere, which has been particularly pronounced since 2007 for reasons that still aren't fully understood. Fracking natural-gas production, which accelerated just as atmospheric methane levels jumped, has been studied as one possible cause.
"Right now, you have one-off reports, but we have no estimate globally of how frequently these things happen," Dr. Hamburg of the Environmental Defense Fund said. "Is this a once a year kind of event? Once a week? Once a day? Knowing that will make a big difference in trying to fully understand what the aggregate emissions are from oil and gas."

Texto completo: It's a huge undertaking to slow climate change, but we've done big things before.
Decades of climate change foot-dragging are finally giving way to public demands for action. Around the world, millions of young people are on the march. Political and business leaders are making pledges and offering plans.
Yet society delayed action for so long that the pace of change now required seems impossible. Greenhouse gases are still rising globally. Some advocacy groups are demanding that these emissions be eliminated entirely within a decade, requiring a scale of industrial and political mobilization matching or exceeding that of World War II.
In the United States, most of the Democratic presidential candidates have embraced a goal that is more limited, but still challenging: cleaning up, to a large degree, the electricity grid by 2030, just 10 years from now. Turning to cleaner energy sources to generate that electricity would not eliminate emissions from other sources like cars and buildings, but it would be a huge step in the right direction. It appears the 2020 election may feature an argument about whether such a rapid cleanup is possible. So is it?
To figure that out, we used the Energy Policy Simulator, developed by the climate policy research group Energy Innovation, to calculate the scale of the required construction program. The results are sobering, but they point to a strategy.
The United States starts with an advantage. Most of the dams built in the first half of the 20th century, and most of the nuclear plants built in the second half, are still supplying power. More recently, wind and solar plants have grown to supply nearly 10 percent of our electricity. Altogether, 38 percent of American electricity already comes from low-emission sources.
Getting the rest of the way in a decade, our modeling suggests, would require a national project of immense scale. New nuclear plants take too long to plan and build, and have incurred disastrous cost overruns, so they are largely off the table for a 2030 target. Instead, American workers would have to build about 120,000 new wind turbines and about 44,000 large solar power plants in a decade.
The pace of construction would need to be three to four times as fast as the maximum annual pace we have achieved so far, in 2012 for wind turbines and in 2016 for solar panels. We would most likely need more than 60,000 miles of new power transmission lines, and many grid batteries to store electrical energy on a large scale and balance the variable wind and solar output.
China, which has four times as many people as the United States, is building renewables faster than any country in the world. Yet the construction program required here would be about as fast as China's best years for wind and solar.
The sheer physical demands of such a rapid build-out are daunting. To construct the turbines, steel mills would have to rev up to meet rising demand; spot shortages of raw materials and price spikes are easy to imagine. The roads would be crawling with trucks hauling huge wind-turbine blades. We would need hundreds of millions of solar panels, and most of the world's production capacity is in China. American solar factories would certainly increase production, but many of the panels would probably have to come from abroad.
Yes, it all sounds quite intimidating.
We know for a fact that such a program is possible, however. We know so for the simple reason that America has tackled grand projects on this scale before.
When Franklin D. Roosevelt became president in 1933, most of rural America still had no electricity. In 1935, he created the Rural Electrification Administration, and in just five years the nation built 250,000 miles of power lines and hooked up nearly a million farms. By the early 1950s, virtually the entire country had electricity. Many Americans have probably heard from their older relatives about the moment the R.E.A. transformed their lives.
As a young Army officer, Dwight D. Eisenhower joined a cross-country convoy in 1919 and was appalled by the condition of the nation's roads. As president, he began construction of the Interstate Highway System in 1956, perhaps America's greatest peacetime construction project. Within five years the country built 10,400 miles of freeways; by 1992 that number quadrupled, to 48,000 miles.
True, those grand programs happened back when America had competent national leadership and a functional Congress. Can we still build at scale? Well, consider this: Since 2010, companies drilled 130,000 new oil and gas wells, many using a tricky -- and controversial -- technology called hydraulic fracturing. Each of those wells was at least as complicated as erecting a wind turbine. Washington may be broken, but America remains a wealthy and skilled nation with a tremendous capacity for large-scale enterprise.
As you may have guessed, the real barriers to getting this done are not physical -- they are legal and bureaucratic. The most critical missing element is a national mandate to do it, but that is not the only problem.
Our power markets, for example, are broken in some big ways. Ill-conceived market rules mean that dirty power plants are still getting paid to keep operating -- or just to sit there! -- across large areas of the United States where wind and solar power can now beat them on price. We may need to use some combination of market reforms and public money to pay utilities to shut down those dirty plants.
If liberals and conservatives joined forces to develop more of a free market in electric power, that would also unlock more low-cost renewable energy. Texas has done this, under Republican leadership, and that huge state of 29 million people is expected to get more than 20 percent of its power from wind turbines this year.
A fast renewable power construction program would require an acceleration of the cumbersome procedures required to put up power lines and other infrastructure. That would have to include speeding up environmental reviews, which can easily take a decade on large projects. We support strong environmental standards, but the reviews should be much faster.
The power-market rules, the bureaucratic hurdles -- those were all created by governments. In the end, whether America can be repowered with green technologies in a decade, or even two, comes back to politics.
In the face of federal intransigence, Texas and some other states are moving forward on clean energy, but states alone cannot secure a safe climate without national leadership. President Roosevelt electrified the nation and President Eisenhower built the freeways because they inspired the public with their visions and won the political capital -- the clout in Congress -- to get it done.
In the end, it is not the capacity of our steel mills or our trucks that will determine how fast we can go. The real question is whether the American people will elect a government in 2020 that is truly committed to salvaging a livable Earth for future generations.

Texto completo: In the annals of “fake news,” a recent New York Times piece impugning FedEx for allegedly paying no taxes may be Exhibit A. Because my office does not subscribe, I had to borrow a copy. But upon reading, it was clear the story was saturated with bias.
Instead of scolding FedEx and sanctimoniously questioning the company's corporate citizenship virtues, the Times should be applauding the company, President Trump, and congressional Republicans. By helping to pass the Tax Cut and Jobs Act two years ago, we helped single moms, middle-class families, small businesses, and companies such as FedEx grow and benefit their workers and customers.
The Times’s assertion that FedEx isn’t paying taxes simply isn’t true. FedEx is paying billions in taxes. But their lower tax burden is also enabling the company to make the very kind of investments and capital expenditures we wanted to incentivize when we passed the TCJA and lowered the corporate tax rate from 35% to a globally competitive 21%. As FedEx CEO Frederick W. Smith recently wrote in the Wall Street Journal, “We placed a major order for 24 Boeing wide-body freighters, funded major facility modernizations and expansions, put additional funds in our pension plan, and increased wages by more than $200 million.”
Smith noted that each order of one type of Boeing aircraft (the 777F) “injects about $540 million into the U.S. economy, supports 1,850 jobs, and generates roughly $45 million in federal, state and local taxes.”
As the member of Congress who represents Wichita, Kansas — also known as the “Air Capital of the World” — I have seen the economic implications of these purchases firsthand. After the passage of the TCJA, FedEx, like many companies, consciously adjusted its behavior, investing in its equipment and employees. FedEx helped not only Boeing but other companies such as Wichita’s Spirit AeroSystems and other local aircraft suppliers that benefit from increased aviation purchases. All of these decisions generate new economic activity and new tax revenues for governments at all levels.
Cessna, another Wichita-based aviation company, has also seen expanded growth as a consequence of the tax law. Since the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, deliveries of Cessna Citation jets in 2018 were at their highest since 2009. This increased demand for aviation companies means jobs for a critical industry in my district. It shows that two years after the law was implemented, tax cuts are helping families and businesses thrive.
FedEx’s Smith was rightly apoplectic following the Times story. He challenged Times publisher A.G. Sulzberger to a public debate about “federal tax policy and the relative societal benefits of business investments … to the United States economy, especially lower- and middle-class wage earners.”
FedEx made a point of noting that it has paid almost $10 billion in total taxes in the U.S. during the last five fiscal years, even as the Times “paid zero federal income tax in 2017 on earnings of $111 million, and only $30 million in 2018.”
FedEx also emphasized that the investments it made following the passage of the TCJA included a voluntary contribution of $1.5 billion to the FedEx pension plan and more than $200 million in increased wages, two-thirds of which went to hourly workers.
The Times obviously doesn’t want to admit that the Tax Cut and Jobs Act is working because that would give President Trump and Republicans credit for our current booming economy. Likewise, many Democratic politicians have tried to write off the benefits of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Yet, two years after its enactment, the law continues to fuel growth, investment, and the lowest employment rate in 50 years. This economic growth has also increased middle-class incomes by $5,000 in the last three years, compared to just a $1,200 increase in the previous seven years.
Democrats and the Times may not want to remind Americans (and voters) about the benefits of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act for fear of losing the next election. But no matter what they think, America’s economy is growing, and families are benefiting. And like FedEx, companies all across the country are finally able to invest in new equipment and their employees for the first time in years. This is something we should all celebrate, and the Times should live up to its motto — "All the News That's Fit to Print."

Bret Stephens: Britain’s ominous portent for the Democrats

Texto completo: When Britain flummoxed and flabbergasted the world by voting in 2016 to leave the European Union, it seemed like a one-off: An unexpected gamble by a normally prudent country, but nothing that signified a profound shift beyond the United Kingdom and Europe.
Donald Trump’s election a few months later proved otherwise. Brexit was a portent, not a fluke. The British electorate may have been incautious, but it was ahead of the trend. The desire, however misplaced or ugly, to “take back” control of a country from supercilious political elites was a global phenomenon, not a local event.
Don’t think it can’t happen again, in much the same way.
That’s a lesson Democrats ought to draw, quickly and clearly, from the thumping victory Boris Johnson won for the Conservative Party on Thursday. As recently as September, some left-wing pundits and politicians were glibly writing off Johnson as a “failed prime minister,” peddling a “fantasy” of a renegotiated Brexit and facing “political disgrace” after losing his majority in Parliament.
Today, Johnson has renegotiated Brexit, the Tories have their largest majority since 1987, and Labour has suffered its worst defeat since 1935.
How did he do this? In four ways, each of which has parallels with Trump.
First, Johnson was fortunate in his political foes. He ran against the most avowedly leftist frontbench the Labour Party has put forward since the early 1980s. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn proudly calls himself a “socialist.” He rails against a “rigged system” that supposedly exists for the benefit of a handful of billionaires. His campaign promised free college, dramatic increases in health spending, a hike in the minimum wage, massive infrastructure spending, new taxes on the rich, and a “new green deal.”
Sound familiar? It’s the Warren-Sanders manifesto, only with British pound signs rather than dollar signs attached.
Second, Johnson was faithful to his base. He ran as the candidate of Brexit — not, as Theresa May had, as its reluctant and dutiful custodian, but as its persevering and happy warrior. Brexit wasn’t just about unyoking the U.K. from the EU. It was also a statement of British self-belief, self-reliance and capacity for self-rule.
That meant that the moment Brexit passed, it was both morally wrong and politically dumb to try to reverse the result. The former, because it was an attempt to nullify people’s votes. The latter, because it could only be accomplished by means of complex parliamentary and legalistic maneuvers to get a second referendum — carried out by the people who always claim to know what’s true and right.
If impeachment — which I support as a matter of constitutional duty but fear on political grounds — winds up helping Trump get reelected, it will be for similar reasons. That is, Democrats got so wrapped up in trying to bring the president down by legal and legislative means that they forgot to bring him down by ordinary political ones. The main job of any competent opposition is to fight the next election, not relitigate the past.
Third, Johnson was attuned to the moment. The prime minister is an ideological opportunist, not a purist. This upsets his critics on the right, who dislike some of his big-spending promises. And it confirms the view of his critics on the left, who see his political plasticity as being of a piece with his moral plasticity.
But we live in a moment when many things are fluid and bending. Voters seem comfortable with leaders whose policies defy most of the usual left-right categories, including on matters like moral character or budgetary discipline. What matters more is relatability, reliability and results. Does the candidate get people like me? Will he keep his political promises? And has he achieved something that directly and tangibly benefits me?
This is Trump’s calling card, as it is Johnson’s. Are there equivalent figures on the left in the U.S. or U.K. willing to shake free from their party’s increasingly tightfitting, ideological straitjackets?
Finally, Johnson has benefited from critics whose mode of analysis is that anything and everything he does is dumb, dishonest, wretched and ruinous. Lately, they warn that he will bring about the end of the country itself. Similarly in the United States, some anti-Trump pundits have been forecasting economic decline and doom for three years straight as the economy continues to grow and unemployment plummets.
Bad things can — and, inevitably, will — happen. In the meantime, what we have is a trans-Atlantic case of boys crying wolf. Does it ever occur to the critics that, by constantly inferring or predicting the worst about either man, they make their less-than-worst moments look good, and their good ones seem positively great?
Regular readers of this column know that I have no wish to see Trump reelected (though I am delighted by Corbyn’s drubbing). If they share my wish, they should heed Thursday’s lesson: Like Johnson, Trump is a formidable incumbent. To oppose him with Corbynite candidates and progressive primal screams is to ensure his reelection.

Texto completo: Residentes del norte de Estados Unidos empiezan a vivir en carne propia la pesadilla que padecen miles estadounidenses en el sur del país: los cerdos salvajes .
Un reporte del New York Times indica que manadas de especie invasiva, que es común en Texas y otros estados del sur, estarían llegando a los estados del norte desde Canadá.
Relacionado: Cerdos salvajes destruyen cargamento de cocaína escondido en un bosque
El animal es temido por su capacidad destructora. Las noticias de los cerdos acabando con la grama de parques o cultivos en granjas son pan de cada día. Representan pérdidas por un valor cercano a los $2,000 millones de dólares anuales .
“Los cerdos salvajes son destructivos de muchas maneras, impactan varios sectores”, dijo al diario neoyorquino Dale Nolte, en referencia al daño que pueden hacer en las poblaciones de aves, anfibios y reptiles .
Los animales son descendientes de los jabalíes que trajeron los conquistadores europeos , quienes los usaban para tener presas de caza y alimentarse. Con el paso del tiempo se mezclaron con los cerdos de granjas que se escapaban.
El reporte dice que los animales han sido llevados por humanos desde Texas a otros estados con el fin de estimular a los cazadores. El problema es que son especies bastante prolíficas. Una hembra puede tener dos partos de seis crías por año.
En Canadá también fueron traídos para la caza en la década de los ochenta. Se creyó que no iban a resistir el invierno, pero expertos comprobaron que los cerdos aprendieron a hacer madrigueras para aislarse del frío. Otros han desarrollado pieles gruesas.
El gobierno de Estados Unidos hace seguimiento a la situación en la frontera norte y respondería con un ataque aéreo contra los animales.
Los cerdos son portadores de al menos 33 enfermedades , entre ellas la tuberculosis bovina. A los animales se les culpa de los brotes de E. Coli en lechuga y espinaca ya que los cerdos estarían defecando en las granjas.

Texto completo: OLIVESBURG, OHIO – For Sam Donohue, philanthropy started early.
The son of Crestview graduates Sean and Molly Donohue, the 5-year-old came up with the idea to have a drive for socks for needy children.
His idea blew up more than his parents could have imagined. The drive led to the donation of 619 pairs of socks, 80 hats and 121 pairs of gloves. People also contributed three earmuffs, three headbands, a pair of shoes, a fleece jacket and a scarf.
"It kind of spread, which was really awesome," Molly Donohue said. "It got exciting for us as parents."
The idea came from the children's book "What Do You Do with an Idea," a New York Times bestseller.
"You change the world," Donohue said. "It's kind of a lot for a 5-year-old. We tried to make it make more sense to him.
"We could help other people. Socks and warm things are not something everybody has. It started very small."
It grew very big.
Donohue's mother, Joyce Brennan, shared the idea with her garden club.
"They did a huge collection," Donohue said.
A neighbor – the Donohues live in Akron – donated 200 pairs of socks. Sean Donohue mentioned the drive at his workplace.
Because of the huge haul, the Donohues divided the donations between Crestview and Akron City Schools, where Sam is in preschool.
"It was all going to be for Crestview," Molly Donohue said. "I wanted to give back. Our roots go back to Crestview."
Molly graduated in 1999, while her husband graduated in 1998.
She and Sam took the items to Crestview Elementary School early last week, coordinating with school counselor Taylor White.
"We have a lot of students that come in without gloves or hats," she said.
White gave socks to a boy whose family had recently moved. She said she was impressed with Sam's initiative.
"It was very unexpected that a 5-year-old had the idea," White said. "It was very much appreciated."
Donohue also has a niece who is in the first grade at Crestview.
One of the family's neighbors bought the book "What Do You Do with an Idea?" for Sam and asked him to pick another child he thought would have good ideas to change the world.
"Pretty cool," Donohue said.
According to amazon.com, "What Do You Do With an Idea?" is for anyone who's ever had a big idea.
It's the story of one brilliant idea and the child who helps to bring it into the world. As the child's confidence grows, so does the idea itself. And then, one day, something amazing happens.
Amazon.com says it is a story for anyone, at any age, who's ever had an idea that seemed a little too big, too odd, too difficult. It's a story to inspire you to welcome that idea, to give it some space to grow and to see what happens next. Because your idea isn't going anywhere. In fact, it's just getting started.
Donohue said she and her husband try to give back, noting the Ronald McDonald House is one of their favorite charities.
She is challenging News Journal readers to keep the idea going on their own. She wants the same for Sam.
"I'm hoping that this continues his whole life," Donohue said.
Sam Donohue, 5, started a sock drive for needy kids that ended up with nearly 600 donated pairs.

Texto completo: San Diego - When Orioles executive vice president/general manager Mike Elias addressed the team's affiliates at their annual dinner Tuesday night in San Diego, he touted the player development progress made in the first year of the team's rebuild and the momentum toward continuing that.
All that development, however, could be happening in a vastly different environment considering Major League Baseball's proposal to cut 42 minor league teams, reorganize the affiliate structure and change the way prospects get to the major leagues. It's all a part of sweeping changes to the Professional Baseball Agreement that governs the relationships between MLB and Minor League Baseball and expires next year.
Many of the Orioles' affiliates have come out against the plan, with the Triple-A Norfolk Tides, Double-A Bowie Baysox and High-A Frederick Keys issuing statements praising Congress forming the "Save Minor League Baseball" task force to protect the threatened MiLB teams. Frederick is on the initial list of teams in jeopardy, according to The New York Times.
The proposal was a big part of commissioner Rob Manfred's annual winter meetings press conference, and Elias' final media session Wednesday. Where it didn't really come up was at the affiliates dinner, which celebrated the successes of the farm system at a time when it is receiving more attention than ever. And more attention means more money.
"For us, we've found success in the current setup and we really like the way our minor leagues are situated with Baltimore, with all of them so close," Elias said. "It's all a big part of our fanbase. To us, 'Birdland' is this entity that extends beyond Baltimore and includes our minor league facilities. We like our setup. We think it's helpful for us, but any time there's new regulation, you certainly have to tailor your strategy towards it.
"Unless that happens, it's hard to know what that looks like. But I think we know how to succeed in the current setup and the current environment as well anyone."
Ken Young, owner of Norfolk, Bowie, and Frederick and president of the Tides, said the affiliates have gotten that same impression, and he's hopeful none of those teams end up on the outside of whatever agreement is reached.
He posited that the published list of possible teams to cut was compiled by some who "didn't have a great knowledge of the minor leagues," while expressing hope that MLB "will see that it's in their best interest to do something different than the cut they were planning."
"The Orioles, and Mike may have told you this if you ask him, really like where their affiliates are right now, including Frederick," Young said. "They think they have a great situation, so Frederick being on that list wasn't caused by the Orioles, because the Orioles' desire is still to play in Frederick. Eventually, that's the way it's going to continue to be."
Elias didn't address the plan in the full-group setting of the annual dinner.
"I think there's some anxiousness on all of our parts when there's ideas floating around out there, but it hasn't been a topic of conversation," Elias said.
"We're focused on the current setup. We had a terrific year. ... I think we have a lot to celebrate there, and some really good relationships across all of our affiliates between the front office and each minor league affiliate."
Manfred said Wednesday that the negotiations between the two sides had been "a little more positive" while noting that the initial reporting of the proposal is "by no means a fait accompli as to what the agreement is going to look like."
He also said that MLB would be flexible, while MiLB "has taken the position that they're not willing to discuss anything but the status quo or any changes that would provide for upgrades in adequate facilities, better working conditions for our players." He added that the minor league side's actions in breaking the confidentiality of the negotiations created some ill will from the major league owners.
Earlier this fall, MiLB representatives presented the same kind of intransigence about their major league counterparts.
MLB subsidizes minor league baseball "to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars every single year," Manfred said when asked whether he appreciated that teams in small towns across the country are a conduit to growing the game.
"Given that we are already subsidizing at the level that I've previously referred to, I think it is unreasonable to come to a bargaining table and say, 'Yeah, we got some facilities. We know they're substandard. In fact, they may not be fixable, but we're not willing to do anything about that.' That's unreasonable."
MiLB, for its part, issued a lengthy statement Friday to dispute most of what Manfred claimed, pushing back on everything from facilities issues to travel and player welfare while noting what's overseen by the major league clubs versus the minor league affiliates.
Part of the issue of facilities standards applies to the player development conditions at the Maryland stadiums that house Orioles affiliates, too. Some of the charms and quirks of a minor league stadium are less so when it comes to taking batting practice and building professional athletes.
There's an expectation at some affiliates that investment toward upgrades that best align with the organization's player development goals are on the horizon.
And while each side has painted the other's negotiators as stubborn at one turn or another, the scope of what's been proposed and what significant changes could mean should be plenty to allow for an agreement.
"This has been one of the great relationships in American sports history," Bowie general manager Brian Shallcross said. "It's the reason our sport covers every corner of the United States, the system between Major League Baseball and Minor League Baseball. Look at any other sport. It just doesn't work like the baseball model works.
"I think that at the end of the day, that's still going to be intact, and we've got to make sure that we respect the wishes of our major league partners and certainly that the game of baseball takes top priority, for what's good for the game."

Texto completo: If social media is your résumé, DM is your inbox.
When my husband decided to propose to me three years ago, he needed help picking out an engagement ring. He quickly realized he didn't have phone numbers or email addresses for my friends and family, but since we were all connected on social media, he gathered opinions by sending direct messages over Facebook messenger. This was the best way to establish communication quickly and discreetly.
A direct message -- DM -- is a one-on-one conversation with another user hosted on a social media platform. Most of the places you spend your time online -- like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, LinkedIn and so on -- offer some form of DM communication.
"In 2019, if social media is your résumé, DM is your inbox," said Natalie Zfat, a social media expert. You can DM just about anyone, whether you know them or not, without needing to know their contact information. And, unlike email, DMs let you know when your message has been seen.
"The barrier to communicating with people outside your realm socially, professionally and geographically is shrinking," said Margaret Morris, a clinical psychologist and author of "Left to Our Own Devices: Outsmarting Smart Technology to Reclaim Our Relationships, Health and Focus." However, just because it might be easy to send a private message doesn't mean your note will be effective or without risk. A DM is tantamount to sitting across the table from someone who has given you their time and their openness, Dr. Morris said. You want to use that opportunity well.
Even though it's common, sending a DM remains an intimate and slightly mysterious corner of social media. Here's what to keep in mind when reaching out to people in your personal and professional lives, along with some tips on communicating with commercial brands so you have a better chance of breaking through the noise and getting a positive response.
Personal relationships
Keep it short. Think a few sentences, not several paragraphs. "When DMing, give the recipient the information they need," Ms. Zfat said. If you're interested in continuing the conversation, suggest moving it over to email within the first two or three messages.
Don't make demands. "If you've never sent somebody a message before, your first message to them should never be a request of them," said Luvvie Ajayi Jones, a speaker and New York Times best-selling author of "I'm Judging You: The Do-Better Manual." Ms. Ajayi, who hosts the "Rants & Randomness" podcast, said that it can come off as inauthentic if your first message to someone is a "help me do this thing" plea.
Avoid chasing someone across several platforms. Ms. Ajayi doesn't like it when people send her DMs across multiple platforms hoping to catch her attention. "You could've just sent one email as opposed to five DMs to get me to respond," she said.
Be interesting. Use your introductory message to offer something relevant to the person you're DMing (a video, a song, an article), and say, "Here's something I thought you'd enjoy." Dr. Morris said this can be a quick way to show some personality, intellect and taste without explicitly saying: "These are my interests."
It might feel like a private exchange, but don't assume it is. "Keep in mind that anything we write through direct messaging could become part of a public post," Dr. Morris said. This happens not only in cases of sexual harassment, but also when someone has responded either in a discouraging way or reached out to someone in a way that doesn't feel appropriate. Act accordingly.
Professional contacts
Explain why you're reaching out. Be specific. Don't ask if you can pick their brain, said Alison Green, who runs the Ask a Manager blog. This is such a vague request that most people don't know what you're looking for or how they can be helpful. Pose precise questions, such as, "I'm wondering about the following two things."
Check your DMs regularly, especially your requests folder. This way you won't miss out on any professional opportunities, Ms. Zfat said. "Ninety-two percent of H.R. people use social media before making hiring decisions," she said. "DM might not be the place you sign the contract, but it could be the place you first shake hands."
Let people know how you'd like to be contacted. Consider sharing your email address in your social media profiles, along with a note that lets people know how you want them to connect with you and what you wish to connect over. "You can follow and connect with people all day long, but unless they know how and why to reach out to you, the ball will remain in your court," said Cynthia Johnson, digital marketer and author of "Platform: The Art and Science of Personal Branding." "Take the time to set up a communication flow that works for you."
Be realistic. If you admire a person in your field or industry, chances are that other people do, too. "People are stretched very thin and it's probably not personal if they don't respond to you," Ms. Green said. In fact, Ms. Ajayi said she gets hundreds of DMs every day. "DMs are so casual, so easy to miss," she said. "If I have a busy day, my DMs are the last place I'm checking."
Email is still the safest bet ... for now. If your direct message is unanswered, you might wonder if you should've reached out over email. "I think you'd worry about it less if you had sent an email instead," Ms. Green said. "Email feels the most reliable."
You're allowed one follow-up email if your DM is unanswered. Experts agree that this is generally the limit. You risk appearing pushy if you reach out in different ways too many times. Saying something like, "I'm sorry to bother you, but I just want to make sure that you saw that I asked you about X," can help buffer any potential blowback, Ms. Green said.
Commercial brand
Be nice. "Always keep in mind that there is a human on the other side of a DM who cares about you and your experiences with their brand," said Carly Bigi, founder and chief executive officer of Laws of Motion, a direct-to-consumer womenswear company. Sure, it can feel good to rant, but remember the customer service representative wants to help you find a solution.
The more details you can provide upfront, the better. "A clear description of the product or experience issue will jump-start a brand's ability to fix the problem," Ms. Bigi said. Including pictures will also help determine the best next step.

Leave the company C.E.O. out of it. What doesn't work, Ms. Johnson said, is tagging a chief executive in a complaint over social media. It's wiser to direct grievances or questions to a dedicated customer service account. They're trained to fix your problem.
Share feedback. Critiques not only allow teams to fix any problems on their end, but they also help brands get smarter with their approach, Ms. Bigi said. Thanks to your comments, they'll be able to make adjustments to their products and further develop their technology.
Keep at it. "The truth is the technology malfunctions," Ms. Johnson said. She recommends trying to connect with customer service accounts two or three times to ensure your concern is addressed, as there's always a possibility of human error. Maybe the person who was supposed to respond to your question quit that day. "It's a complicated thing," she said. "So don't necessarily get upset at the first time and try again."

Texto completo: A new TV adaptation by Steven Knight ("Peaky Blinders") presents a portrait of the miser as a (relatively) young man.
BOVINGDON, England -- "I've never done a mouse decapitation before," the actor Johnny Harris said, standing before a canopied bed in a gloomy, almost empty room.
"Her name is Brenda," the mouse-handler said helpfully.
There was silence as Brenda was carefully placed in Harris's hand, and cameras began to roll, moving in on a close-up of the actor's ferocious scowl. With a guttural grunt, he mimed a swift slicing stroke of a knife.
"Cut," called out Nick Murphy, the director of FX and BBC One's new three-part "A Christmas Carol." "And well done, Brenda!"
Rodent murder doesn't generally figure into adaptations of Charles Dickens's perennial Christmas favorite. But this new version, which debuts Dec. 19 in America via FX, was created by Steven Knight, who conceived and writes "Peaky Blinders." As anyone familiar with that gritty, violent period series or Knight's other work ("Taboo," "Eastern Promises") might imagine, his "Christmas Carol" isn't the usual sentimental tale of exaggerated miserliness vanquished by seasonal good will.
Instead, there is a relatively young, embittered Ebenezer Scrooge (Guy Pearce) with obsessive-compulsive tendencies and a history of family trauma. When he revisits his youth with the Ghost of Christmas Past (Andy Serkis), the memories mostly hinge on a terrifying and neglectful father, played by Harris, who abandoned Scrooge to an abusive schoolmaster -- but not before killing young Ebenezer's little white mouse in a wanton act of cruelty.
"A Christmas Carol" is the first in a projected series of Dickens adaptations by Knight to be produced by the BBC and FX. Such coproductions, as well as a growing appetite stateside for British television, have allowed the BBC to become more ambitious with its literary adaptations. "Now that we have the luxury of the eight-hour box set, there is a real opportunity," Knight said.
He began with "A Christmas Carol," he added, because its story of Scrooge, Jacob Marley and the three spirits is shorter and simpler in structure than the complex novels he hopes to take on next ("Great Expectations," "A Tale of Two Cities," "David Copperfield").
"I knew it could be three-parts, not eight," Knight said, adding that the story has been so popular for so long that "there is clearly something in there that is universally appealing."
That's for sure. Within a year of the 1843 publication of the 66-page novella, there were several productions of the story on the London stage. Public readings of the tale were also popular, with Dickens himself performing in both England and America. A New York Times account of his appearance before a packed crowd at Steinway Hall in 1867 reported that he gesticulated freely, making "a face of infinite wonderment and exultation when shouting, in the piping tones of the two youngest Cratchits, 'There's such a goose, Martha!"'
In addition to the countless theater productions, screen adaptations of "A Christmas Carol" have appeared almost as regularly as Christmas itself, starting with the 1901 British silent movie, "Scrooge, or Marley's Ghost." To date, over 20 feature films and around 30 television versions have been made. The Muppets, Mr. Magoo and Bugs Bunny have all had their own -- there has even been a "Doctor Who" episode based on the tale.
So what did Knight feel he could bring to "A Christmas Carol" that made it worth yet another retelling?
"Every generation needs its own interpretation," he said, adding there were issues that Dickens couldn't have raised explicitly but his audience would have understood, like the sexual abuse of children and women, which feature in Knight's version. "I wanted to look at these things, not to disrupt or be shocking, but to say the things one can say now," he said. "I am trying to make some suggestions about why Scrooge is Scrooge."
Murphy said that although he initially hesitated in directing the series ("the Muppets had done 'A Christmas Carol,' and who could top that?"), he was attracted by Knight's approach.
"I liked the idea of examining not just why Scrooge is a bad person, but why do bad people become like that. At this time, there are people on the international stage who seem to live in a moral vacuum, and it's important to think about how people can convince themselves they are doing absolutely nothing wrong."
It's a big step away from the more usual caricature of Scrooge as a wizened old miser who is frightened into repentance. "He is usually a bit like Santa Claus in that you don't really think about him," said Pearce ("The King's Speech"), who is almost never offscreen during the three-hour show. "It's just one of those Christmas things: tree, figgy pudding, presents, Scrooge."
When Pearce first talked to Knight and Murphy about the part, he said they made it clear to him that they wanted a young, robust Scrooge, in the prime of his working life.
"This Scrooge is actually someone with a puffed-out chest, who has swagger and arrogance and a cynicism that is in some ways very healthy," Pearce said in a telephone interview. "He is depressed by the hypocrisy in the world, he has his own very high moral standards, and it has turned him into a warrior, although he uses his weapons in all the wrong ways."
Knight and Murphy follow the traditional outlines of the story, beginning with Scrooge and Bob Cratchit (Joe Alwyn) in his office, a visit from Scrooge's nephew and two men seeking donations for the poor. But their interest in the principal character's psychology keeps the focus tightly on Scrooge throughout the series. Even the settings feel reflective of Scrooge's personality; his office and home are large but palpably cold and devoid of color.
"I wanted his surroundings to be an expression of the emptiness of his soul," Murphy said, adding that he had been inspired by the bleak interiors in the work of the 19th-century Danish painter Vilhelm Hammershoi. Scrooge, he added, "is independent in the frame in those early segments, and gradually, as the story unfolds, it becomes a little more cluttered until we end up tight and close together in the Cratchit house."
Scrooge's journey through his past and toward a more hopeful future involved a rethinking of the role his sister Lottie (Charlotte Riley) has played in his life, as well as a subplot involving Mary Cratchit (Vinette Robinson), the wife of his clerk and mother of the disabled Tiny Tim (Lenny Rush). Both women are minor, almost voiceless characters in the Dickens story, but they have significant roles here.
"I think you need that in a story you are telling in 2019," Robinson said in a telephone interview, adding that her character's new prominence also helped reveal aspects of Scrooge's character. "She has her own power and importance," Robinson added. "Perhaps she is even the one who summons the spirits?"
The suggestion of supernatural forces at work -- and a question-mark over Mary's possible powers -- is "part of the fun," Knight said. "It's very much part of the book, and I hope I've retained some of the Dickens chocolate-box warmth about that spooky element."
Murphy said that he had set out to make the supernatural elements -- ghosts, miraculous changes of time and place, fantastical events -- feel "handmade" rather than through impressive visual effects. "I don't want audiences to think, 'Oh, cool,' and admire the director's ideas during the film," he said. ("I don't mind if they give me awards afterward though," he added, deadpan.)
"It's a world informed by a child's imagination," he added. So while computer-generated imagery is used, Ali Baba's palace, for example, is evoked in the style of Arthur Rackham illustrations. "It has a naïveté and clunkiness, like something dreamed up by a Victorian magician."
Even though the story ends, as it must, with Scrooge's remorseful realization of the wrongs he has done and his newfound desire to make amends, he does not seek forgiveness. Unlike the near-total redemption Scrooge enjoys in most adaptations of "A Christmas Carol," in this version he clearly understands that the sufferings of his childhood don't excuse the behavior of his adult self, and that the consequences of his past behavior can't be changed.
"We shouldn't exist in a world where we say, 'Oh, O.K., you're forgiven,' and crack on; it's about what actions we decide to take after that," Murphy said.
"I think that's Dickens's message in the book," he added. "I feel that the old guy would have liked what we've done."

Texto completo: Two readers worry that the Democratic strategy may backfire and end up helping President Trump.
To the Editor:
Re "Trump Impeachment Articles Approved by House Panel" (nytimes.com, Dec. 13):
By pursuing impeachment when a Senate acquittal is virtually guaranteed, the Democrats are increasing the chances that Donald Trump will be re-elected. Polling has been consistently steady since the impeachment hearings began: According to the Real Clear Politics averages, a majority disapprove of the job he is doing, yet the country is evenly divided as to whether he should be removed from office via the impeachment process.
Americans love an underdog, and sadly that is how this story may be playing out -- the relentless Democrats, some of whom have wanted to impeach the president since before he took office, rushing to judgment against poor Donald Trump.
The Democrats say they must impeach to send a message that Mr. Trump should not repeat his abuses of power. Why not censure the president for those abuses, and let the voters decide in November whether he should keep his job? What message will it send if he is impeached, then acquitted, and then re-elected?

To the Editor:
The deeply divided House Judiciary Committee's approval of two articles of impeachment accusing President Trump of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress could have been so much more than a cathartic partisan exercise had Democrats sought the assistance of the judiciary branch in compelling many of the direct players to testify before Congress.
American voters deserve to hear a firsthand accounting of this president's alleged depravity. If members of the administration were to defy the courts, that in itself would likely influence public opinion as well as the political decisions of any remaining Republicans who possess a semblance of righteousness.
The way things are going, Donald Trump will likely emerge triumphant, and Congress will be further weakened.

To the Editor:
Re "Maybe a Political Plus, but Certainly a Personal Humiliation" (news article, Dec. 13):
On Thursday, the president of the United States, Donald J. Trump, wrote and sent out 123 tweets. This is an amazing and disturbing statistic and a window into the president's mind and mood.
Mr. Trump uses twitter like a "mind dump" to empty the contents of whatever is in his head in the moment. The president's tweets show a mind and a man obsessed with a litany of personal grievances, perceived injustices being perpetrated against him and an impeachment mania. As always, it is all about him. No other presidents would find the time to do all of this tweeting; they would be too busy doing the people's work, not attending to their own personal agenda.
Arguably, this huge wave of tweets, this veritable tsunami of words pouring out of the president, is one more manifestation of a mind in disarray, a mind in a state of deterioration. While no one can deny that having a strong economy and a booming stock market is unabashedly a good thing, having an unhinged, unraveling president most assuredly is not.

Prison Art, Dark With a Muse Always Present

Texto completo: A Drawing Center show makes a soulful statement about the nature of creative expression and what it means to be imprisoned.
In the opening of her new book, "Making Comics," the cartoonist and MacArthur fellow Lynda Barry reminds her adult readers that they made art when they were young, even if they self-consciously stopped doing so long ago. "There was a time when drawing and writing were not separated for you," she writes. "We draw before we are taught."
I thought of Ms. Barry's words about the innate primacy of making marks on paper while exploring "The Pencil Is a Key," a remarkable exhibition at the Drawing Center. The show contains about 140 drawings made by more than 50 artists -- some of whom had begun drawing long before being imprisoned, and others who found their creative voices while behind bars.
The term "incarceration" is used somewhat loosely here. In the catalog, the curators -- all four members of the organization's curatorial staff, and the director -- define incarceration as "any situation in which an individual is denied their freedom." I'd tweak that to physical freedom, as the exhibition features artists who have been confined against their will, whether in French Revolution-era prisons, the Soviet gulag, mental institutions or in the United States under the practice of mass incarceration.
That list only partly represents the range of times and places from which these works come; such breadth is what makes the show so unusual. While wall labels supply information on the artists' identities and the circumstances of their imprisonment -- including presumed innocence or guilt -- "The Pencil Is a Key" is not ultimately about the politics of incarceration. By drawing connections across centuries and cultures, the show makes a soulful statement about the fundamental nature of creative expression and what it means to be imprisoned.
The show begins with familiar names, like Honoré Daumier and Gustave Courbet, both of whom were imprisoned during France's tumultuous 19th century (Daumier for a caricature of the king; Courbet for his part in the Paris Commune). Their inclusion signals not only the historical scope of the exhibition but also its institutionally serious purpose to focus mostly on those who have been identified -- whether by themselves or by society -- as artists, rather than on prisoners who happen to have made art.
There are terrific exceptions in the second gallery: spotlights on paños chicanos, which are drawings on handkerchiefs, and envelope drawings. In these cases, rather than concentrating on specific creators, the curators have included dozens of examples as a means of illuminating resourceful and baroque genres of contemporary American prison art.
Thus a show that begins on fairly traditional ground, with Mr. Daumier's witty lithographs and Mr. Courbet's plaintive sketch of a cell, swiftly veers into more expansive and unpredictable territory.
A series of drawings by Migron, an inmate at Mazas and then Saint-Joseph Prison in France, tells the story of a man who murders his wife's lover in the style of a comic strip. Its simple forms and rich colors have an unlikely resonance with diaristic ledger drawings by Howling Wolf, Bear's Heart and Etadleuh Doanmoe, whose works offer glimpses of their Native American nations' exploits and struggles against the United States government. The three were among the 72 Southern Plains leaders imprisoned at Fort Marion after the late-19th-century Red River War, but two of them were first sent to Fort Sill -- which, as the wall text notes, became a Japanese-American internment site nearly seven decades later.
In a pair of charcoal drawings, Miné Okubo expresses the pain of internment by rendering stone-faced figures in thick strokes with their arms raised. The pose reminded me of photographs of the Holocaust -- which is represented in a group of works nearby. Most haunting are two nightmarish sketches of skeletons playing the clarinet -- studies for the painting "Death Triumphant" (1944) -- made by Felix Nussbaum not long before he was killed at Auschwitz.
"The Pencil Is a Key" runs chronologically, but one of its strengths (helped by the fact that the Drawing Center's main galleries comprise only two rooms) is that you can trace different paths and connections through it. A small, devastating collection of handmade greeting cards from gulag camps -- one for Easter depicts a baby chick breaking free of its shell, with a chain around its neck -- prefigures the envelope art of today: Both seem made to be sent to loved ones, and both repurpose generic imagery for personal expression.
Remarkably, the composition of Mahmoud Mohamed Abd El Aziz's "A Plea to God," which he drew in 2018 while imprisoned in Egypt for participating in anti-government demonstrations, is almost identical to that of the Chilean artist Miguel Lawner Steiman's "Navidad en Ritoque (Christmas in Ritoque)," made while he was incarcerated at a Chilean concentration camp in 1974. The two present bird's-eye views of men -- presumably the artists themselves -- hunched over drawings in their cells.
Such similarities raise questions: Can the aesthetics of prison art be identified or defined? Are people in confinement more likely to draw certain things? The curators avoid a typology, but themes and motifs emerge. Quite a few artists have passed time by making portraits of their fellow inmates, including Zhang Yue in China, José Alvarez (D.O.P.A.) in the United States, and Azza Abo Rebieh in Syria; others, like Inez Nathaniel-Walker, dreamed up the people they drew.
Depictions of the built environment are common, whether intimate, vibrant renderings of life there by Fatima Meer, who was incarcerated during South Africa's apartheid era, or a dense cityscape devoid of humans and drawn from memory by Abdualmalik Abud, who spent almost 15 years at Guantánamo Bay. (His tranquil sketch contrasts sharply with the Guantánamo detainee Abu Zubaydah's recently released drawings of the torture he endured in secret prisons by the C.I.A., made as legal evidence and published in The New York Times.)
Some have tried to escape their confinement by pouring the contents of their imaginations onto the page: Frank Jones, a longtime inmate at Texas State Penitentiary in Huntsville, drew ghosts and devils inside red and blue structures that seem to crackle with fire, while Marcus Behmer, who was imprisoned by the Nazis for homosexuality, is represented here by three trippy, occult-like drawings of humans, animals and hybrid creatures.
As I walked through "The Pencil Is a Key," I made notes about some of the ways that drawing functions for people in captivity: as documentation or expression of identity; as a means to connect with the world or to create other worlds; as a form of currency or communication. Especially because it eschews the complicated issue of legal innocence or guilt, the exhibition provokes serious, empathetic thought.
It will make you consider anew what art is, can be, and can do. To put pencil or pen to paper in such circumstances is to reassert your humanity -- to remind yourself and others that you exist. It's a way of saying "I'm still here," when the powers that be don't want you to be seen.

Texto completo: SENTINEL NEWS SERVICE
Lula Washington Dance Theatre is celebrating KWANZAA with four unforgettable holiday dance concerts at the Lula Washington Dance Theatre's Intimate Studio Stage, 3773 Crenshaw Boulevard, Los Angeles, CA 90016.
In the spirit of the Kwanzaa principle of Kujichagulia, (Self-Determination), the dance company will kick off its Kwanzaa celebrations with the Umoja Circle Dinner and Performance on Friday, Dec. 27 at 6 :00 p.m. at the Lula Washington Dance Theatre. This is a fundraiser to support the on-going work of the dance company and school as it closes out its 39th year and prepares for its year #40.
This event includes dinner, a candle lighting ceremony; a champaign toast to ring in the organizations 40th anniversary in 2020; and a "special" program unique from the other weekend performances.
Our annual Kwanzaa concerts happen as usual on Saturday Dec. 28 at 2:30 p.m.
Tickets are on sale now at Brown Paper Tickets, 800-838-3006; or, online at www.BrownPaperTickets.c om. Ticket prices range from $10 for young children to $35 for the general public. Groups of 10 or more get a 10% discount.
The shows will feature amazing West African drumming and high energy dancing by some of the most talented young artists in Los Angeles!
"We celebrate Kwanzaa every year because it is a cultural holiday that focuses on children, family, and culture," said Lula Washington, artistic director of the dance company. "You will see our tiniest tots to our teens, a reunion of returning college students and company alumni- all dancing with our acclaimed adult touring ensemble. It's beautiful to see the intergenerations of dancers on the stage together, all performing at incredible levels of excellence and passion."
"Kwanzaa is a cultural holiday based on NGUZO SABA, (Seven Principles), which encourages African Americans to know and celebrate their cultural heritage. Kwanzaa aims for people to recommit to their families and communities; and to remember to be faithful to each other as we go through life, " added Tamica Washington-Miller, associate director of the dance company.
This year, we are focusing on self-determination to craft the kind of future that we want for our next 40 years," added Erwin Washington, co-founder and executive director. "We want to be sure that we can continue our good work for the future, and that means we have to build broader support financially so the dance and educational work can continue."
Reviewer Tonya Plank called Lula's Kwanzaa the "The best dance show she's seen in Los Angeles." The New York Times has praised Lula Washington as a "gifted original."
The Kwanzaa performance is sponsored in part by the Los Angeles City Department of Cultural Affairs; Kaiser Permanente; the Los Angeles County Department of Arts and Culture; and Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas.

Texto completo: NEW YORK (AP) - An 18-year-old Barnard freshman has been fatally stabbed in a park in Manhattan, sending shock waves through the college and wider Columbia University community.
“With broken hearts, we share tragic news about the death of one of our students," Barnard President Sian Leah Beilock said late Wednesday in a letter to the campus. “This is an unthinkable tragedy that has shaken us to our core."
The letter identified the student as Tessa Majors and said she was fatally wounded during an armed robbery near Barnard's campus. Barnard College is part of Columbia University.
Police said they responded to an assault report at around 5:30 p.m. and found an unconscious woman, who had been stabbed multiple times. She died at a hospital.
There have been no arrests.
The teen's parents, who live in Charlottesville, Virginia, headed to New York after learning the tragic news, her grandparents told New York's Daily News.
Her grandfather, Andrew Burton, called her “a lovely, lovely girl - very, very smart and sweet.”
Isabel Jauregui, a Barnard student who works on the Columbia Spectator campus newspaper, told The New York Times that students were on edge.
“My friend is throwing up in the bathroom,” she said. “She’s so scared.”
Counselors were being made available.
“In these difficult circumstances, it is important for us to take care of each other," Beilock wrote. “Please hold Tessa and her family in your hearts and keep each other close."

Texto completo: At the Redwoods, a Mill Valley community of seniors, we're aiming to turn green by changing our recycling habits, saving water, planting trees, turning off unnecessary lights and using as little plastic as we can. We're not taking cold showers yet but at least we're using cold water for the laundry.
Mill Valley Seniors for Peace, a community group, was founded at the Redwoods. You've probably seen us waving signs and singing every Friday from 4-5 p.m., rain or shine, on the corner of Camino Alto and Miller Avenue. The Redwoods' CEO, Hunter Moore, often joins in with his guitar. And we have now launched a climate crisis group, led by Carol Saysette and John R. Boettiger, to study and implement green ideas.
This crisis group recently hosted Professor Andrew Jones of the University of North Carolina, who is also a lecturer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Jones emphasized the crucial role in global warming played by combustion of fossil fuels gas, oil, and coal and the consequent emission of carbon dioxide, a "greenhouse gas".
By enrolling the United States in the International Paris Climate Accord of 2015, along with 194 other nations, President Barack Obama pledged to work toward reducing our "carbon footprint" on the natural world. The goal was to reduce the global temperature rise to only 2 degrees Celsius (or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels.
How to start? "Many small efforts grow to big results," Jones said, illustrating with color graphics: the use of LED lighting, solar and wind energy sources, turning out lights in empty rooms, and switching to bicycles and electric cars. He urged us to develop an action plan for ourselves, our employers, our friends and families.
People who own stocks should rid themselves of companies that invest in fossil fuels, he said. "They are the polluters-in-chief; there is no silver bullet only silver buckshot." We must also reduce atmospheric methane (a greenhouse gas 25 times more harmful than C02) that is given off by cattle. This means cutting back on cheese and milk and giving up beef "Start by renouncing hamburgers for plant-based Impossible Burgers, which are remarkably good," he said.
In early December the New York Times published "Five Global Trends Shaping Our Climate Future." Among the main takeaways from the 180-page report are these:
 Renewable electricity is set to surpass coal soon. Still the consumption of coal, the world's dirtiest fuel, is starting to stall. Investment in new coal-fired power plants has slowed as countries like India find that solar panels and battery storage can often be cheaper to produce electricity.
 Offshore wind goes big. And mainstream projections are that global use for gasoline could peak by the mid-2020s
 Energy efficiency efforts are slowing and it's important that countries improve the efficiency of their homes, factories, schools and vehicles through building codes and fuel economy standards.
 What happens in Africa is crucial which is projected to urbanize over the next few decades at at faster pace than China did in the 1990 and 2000s.
As a nation, we need to hit polluters with a carbon tax, and to rejoin the Paris Accord, which President Donald Trump has scorned.
Readers, why not join the Mill Valley Seniors for Peace Climate Action Group? Meetings are held from four to five p.m. on the fourth Tuesday of every month, except for December. We also welcome participants in our Friday afternoon demonstrations and singing. Find out more at MVseniorsforpeace.org. Or form your own group.
None of this is easy, but how could you explain to your kids that you did nothing?

Texto completo: Disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein reached a tentative settlement with his sexual misconduct accusers, but he couldn't stop a judge from doubling his bail Wednesday for allegedly messing with his electronic ankle monitor so he could disappear for hours at a time.
According to a report, the $25 million settlement doesn't require Weinstein to pay a dime - or admit he did anything wrong.
Under the agreement, the insurance companies representing Weinstein's bankrupt film studio would foot the bill for payments to women who have accused the disgraced movie mogul of rape and sexual misconduct, according to The New York Times.
The agreement did not please all of Weinstein's accusers.
"We reject the notion that this was the best settlement that could have been achieved on behalf of the victims," said Douglas Wigdor, who represents at least two of Weinstein's alleged victims.
"It is shameful that $12 million of the settlement is going to the lawyers for the directors who we alleged enabled Harvey Weinstein, and it is even more outrageous that the proposed settlement will seek to bind non participating members by providing a release to the insurance companies and the directors of the Weinstein Co. itself. " Wigdor said.
"While we don't begrudge victims who want to settle, we plan to vigorously object to any provision that tries to bind victims who want to proceed with holding Harvey Weinstein accountable for his actions which is exactly what we intend to do."
Weinstein, meanwhile, had to cough up another $1 million to stay out of jail on sexual assault charges against him. A Manhattan judge doubled his bail to $2 million from $1 million amid allegations that he tampered with his electronic monitoring device.
Weinstein used a walker to shuffle into a Manhattan courtroom for a bail hearing where he was hoping to escape over the alleged violation.
A wobbly Weinstein appeared pained as he hobbled into Manhattan Supreme Court, but his lawyer, Donna Rotunno, insisted that the fallen film czar's use of a walker was not a sympathy plea.
Days earlier, Weinstein had limped into the courthouse. Rotunno said Weinstein is scheduled to have back surgery on Thursday.
"We insisted that he use a walker today," Rotunno told reporters outside court. "Mr. Weinstein didn't want the press to think he was seeking sympathy. He's in pain. He's having surgery."
Weinstein's legal team had blamed dead batteries in his ankle monitoring device for dropping the law enforcement radar for hours at a time.
But prosecutors said Weinstein had been disabling a piece of his tracking device, and told Judge James Burke that they feared the alleged sex offender might flee the country ahead of his trial, which is slated to begin on Jan. 6.
"He certainly has means to fly private jets back and forth across the country," Assistant District Attorney Joan Illuzzi-Orbon said.
"These were not technical glitches in any way shape or form," she added. "Mr. Weinstein didn't want people to know where he was."
Weinstein was found to have tampered with his ankle monitor 57 times in just two months and didn't report malfunction difficulties until he got caught, prosecutors said.
Weinstein assured the judge he had "every intention" of being at his trial.

A noose, a menstrual cup, Hitler's mustache: The anti-vaxxers' shameful toolbox Sun Sentinel Editorial

Texto completo: It's ugly, the way a small but vocal band of activists are fighting to keep kids from having to get mandatory - and necessary - vaccinations to attend public schools and keep our communities safe.
Really ugly.
Take what happened to Florida Sen. Lauren Book of Plantation after she filed a bill to end the religious exemption for public school vaccinations and create a medical review panel to examine any unusual trends in medical exemptions.
Someone on social media posted a doctored photo of Book, who is Jewish, in Nazi regalia with a Hitler mustache. Another criticized her children and her father. Another accused her of being a medical rapist - of holding and injecting children against their will. If you know anything about Book's crusade against child sexual abuse, you know such comments are both cruel and absurd.
Or take what happened in California in October after state senators passed a bill that tightens the rules on vaccine exemptions. A woman in the Senate gallery threw a menstrual cup down upon them, splashing several.
Or take what happened to U.S. Rep. Frederica Wilson of Miami Gardens in June, after she refiled a bill to stop states from allowing non-medical exemptions for school vaccines. A man left a voicemail threatening to kill her.
"I'm gonna kill your ass if you do that bill, I swear. I will f--ing come down and kill your f--ing ass. This is the United States of America, bitch. Get the f-- out. I'll tell you what. I'll come down to Miami, bitch. I'll f- you up," said the man, whom federal officials later identified as Darryl Varnum, a Maryland anti-vaxxer and cybersecurity engineer for a Pentagon contractor.
Sadly, it wasn't Wilson's only death threat on the issue. Earlier this year, someone else mailed her a noose.
Leaders of the anti-vaxxer movement may not intend violence, but they have fostered an environment where followers feel emboldened to bully, threaten and attack people who stand up for science and public health.
"I've been in public life a long time and I've never experienced anything like this," Wilson told us. "I've had people say, "'We don't agree with you.' But nobody wants to kill you."
Unfortunately, the protesters' bullying tactics are delivering success. They are convincing some Florida lawmakers that childhood vaccines are a political issue, not a serious public health issue.
Republican Sen. Gayle Harrell of Stuart, who chairs the Florida Senate's Health Policy Committee, is refusing to hear Book's bill because she doesn't support eliminating the religious exemption or creating a panel to review medical exemptions.
Harrell told us she believes in vaccinations, but when her legislative delegation met in West Palm Beach some weeks back, about 25 people - including one rabbi - showed up to testify against Book's bill. They were concerned about fetal DNA being in the vaccines that protect children and teens from 16 deadly diseases. Opposed to abortion, the speakers said they were opposed to vaccinating children for religious reasons.
In an accompanying editorial, we call attention to the growing public health threat facing Florida because of the growing number of unvaccinated schoolchildren. The CDC counted Miami-Dade, Broward, Orange and Hillsborough among the Top 25 counties most at risk for a measles outbreak this year.
In it, we note that vaccines are highly purified, though they may contain traces of DNA from the human or animal cells they were grown in, the New York Times reports. These include ancestor cells from aborted fetuses never exposed to pathogens, the paper reports.
Nonetheless, "religious authorities have meticulously studied how vaccines are made and what is in them, and still have ruled that they do not violate Jewish, Islamic or Catholic law," the paper reports.
If all the major religions support the use of vaccines that have saved more than 10 million lives around the globe, why should Florida do otherwise?
"I haven't found a religion yet that prohibits it," said Rabbi David Shabtai of Boca Raton. "It's often just people who are hiding their personal choice.
"Whenever I talk to someone who has a religious exemption, they believe they don't work, they aren't necessary or they're dangerous. They're couching their concerns in religious terms and that's fraud. That's just fraud."
Harrell told us she also objects to the creation of a medical review panel. "We're going to have everyone who needs a medical exemption go before a panel?" Imagine the cost of having five doctors examine every child, review their medical records and talk to their parents, she says.
But that's not what Book's bill suggests at all. Rather, a medical review would be triggered only if a high concentration of medical exemptions arises from one physician or one practice. Such a mechanism is justified given the experience in other states that have ended religious exemptions, only to see medical exemptions surge.
Book said she got involved after a coalition of religious leaders approached her following last spring's measles outbreak in an ultra-Orthodox Jewish community in New York. They were concerned about the anti-Semitism that came from that.
Book hoped to start a conversation. A committee hearing or workshop would unquestionably help everyone, including Harrell, better understand what's at risk and what Book's bill proposes. But it's not going to happen, at least not this year.
"They have succeeded in making people believe it's about religious freedom, when it's really about the health and safety of children and folks across our state," Book says.
"God bless them, they're organized. They've been to every single delegation meeting, some group of them. There's not any member of the Legislature that doesn't know that 674 is that crazy vaccine bill Sen. Book is doing. They don't know what it is, or what it does, but they know they've gotten got emails about it. It's a dangerous way to look at this issue.
"This is something that's not going away," Book says. "We know we're going to have an outbreak."
When that outbreak happens, who should we hold accountable? The ugly posters on social media? Or the people elected to keep us safe?

A STRIKE TO DEMOCRACY HONG KONG ELECTIONS A BLOW TO MAINLAND CHINA

Texto completo: The democracy movement in Hong Kong posted a significant victory in local elections Nov. 24, embarrassing the pro-Beijing government which has taken a tough line with protesters.
The mainland China government's desire to control the city and rein in its citizenry has collided with a long tradition of democratic rule and individual freedoms. Those freedoms included democratic elections, a free press and an independent judiciary. China considers those hallmarks of freedom thorns in the side.
China's attempts at tightening control over the city have backfired.
In recent district council elections, turnout hit record levels and pro-democracy candidates won some 377 of 452 elected seats. Pro-government, pro-China candidates were defeated, holding onto only 48 seats. Pro-government candidates had held about 300 seats.
Voters sent the mainland and pro-China government of the city a clear message: Voters support democracy and the protesters, who have been increasingly subjected to harsh police tactics.
The local councils have influence in choosing Hong Kong's overall government. The victory of the democratic movement means that pro-democracy candidates will gain greater strength on the governing council, much to China's chagrin.
Democracy and human rights are dear to Americans, and many people around the world see us as a model for their aspirations of self-government. In a democracy, wrongs can be remedied. Dictatorships and autocracies are not generally amenable to change.
The aspirations of the people of Hong Kong are the same aspirations of America's founders, then, later, advocates for women's suffrage and civil rights. They sought to make our government and society fulfill its promise as the nation matured.
America must support the democracy movement in Hong Kong.
A survey by the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute shows 68 percent of Americans believe the United States should support the democracy movement in Hong Kong, even if it angers China. If China escalates suppression in Hong Kong, 69% of Americans would favor economic sanctions on China.
President Donald Trump has signed bills passed by Congress imposing sanctions on Hong Kong. Experts hold different opinions on who will be hurt, average citizens of the city or both the U.S. and Chinese economies. The president must keep up the pressure either way because, either way, democracy is the American way.

Ending Our Endless War in Afghanistan

Texto completo: We need to press for an agreement between the U.S. and the Taliban and cement the parallel support of the Afghan government.
I took command of the United States Army's 75th Ranger Regiment two months before the Sept. 11 attacks. Not long after, the regiment deployed to Afghanistan as part of the American effort to destroy Al Qaeda and remove the Taliban from power.
In the 18 years since, soldiers from the 75th Ranger Regiment, a Special Operations light-infantry unit, have always been deployed to Afghanistan. And as others did, I returned many times thereafter. During his Thanksgiving visit to American troops in Afghanistan, President Trump declared that he had reopened peace talks with the Taliban. The president's announcement is a rare chance to end our longest war.
We are now in a position to seal a United States-Taliban agreement that would lead to intra-Afghan negotiations and move the conflict into the political realm. We should not miss this opportunity.
The war has exacted an overwhelming cost: 1,892 American military personnel killed in action and 20,589 wounded, about a trillion dollars spent, the psychological and emotional impact on veterans and their families, and similar material and human costs to our allies. And there is the devastating cost paid by the people of Afghanistan: Of the 147,000 killed in the war since 2001, more than 38,000 have been civilians. This long war must end.
The first opportunity to end this conflict on our terms was in 2002 when Al Qaeda was dispersed and the Taliban were shattered. A persistent political and diplomatic effort supported by steady military support could have put us on a different path. Instead, the intervening years brought one failed strategy after another, each for identifiable reasons: diverted attention, lack of military resources, loss of political will, arbitrary timelines, a resurgent and externally supported Taliban, fatigue in both the United States and Afghanistan and severe internal problems within the Afghan government.
The most recent opportunity to achieve our objectives emerged in August 2017 with the announcement of the Trump administration's South Asia strategy, which earmarked political reconciliation between the Afghan government and the Taliban as our principal objective.
At the time, I was commander of United States Central Command, responsible for our military operations in an area that spread from Egypt to Pakistan and Kazakhstan to Yemen -- including Afghanistan. We recognized early that the South Asia strategy was a prudent and realistic way to put focus back into the political and diplomatic realm and that pursuing a political settlement was our best chance to end the war.
We also knew a quick resolution wasn't possible given the obstacles: A fractured Afghan government, Pakistan continuing to enable the Taliban, the influence of Iran and Russia, mixed Afghan military performance, increasing high-profile insurgent attacks in urban areas of Afghanistan, lack of trust between the principal Afghan adversaries and emergence of a branch of the Islamic State in Nangarhar province in eastern Afghanistan.
The United States continued working toward our objective, and there has been some progress since August 2017. There have been short cease-fires, a marked decrease in Pakistan interference, direct talks with the Taliban, preliminary agreements and a prisoner exchange. But there has also been continuing violence, a breakdown in talks and a continuing lack of trust between the Afghan government and the Taliban.
The Taliban refused to open direct talks with the Afghan government, so the United States took a first step toward peace by opening peace negotiations with them, which we hoped would lead to internal Afghan-Taliban negotiations.
Despite the uneven progress on the ground, the special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad, the chief American negotiator, supported by American and coalition forces, continued to press for peace. Even after the peace negotiations stopped in September following a spike in Taliban violence, Mr. Khalilzad continued his shuttle diplomacy to preserve this tenuous opportunity.
On Saturday Mr. Khalilzad rejoined negotiations with the Taliban in Doha, Qatar. We need to press for an agreement between the United States and the Taliban and cement the parallel support of the Afghan government. This would lead within days to the initiation of direct meetings between the Afghan government and the Taliban.
Specific agreed-upon conditions would then drive the pace of the withdrawal of American forces. But the Taliban must demonstrate commitment to our shared objectives of a reduction in violence, make an unambiguous break from Al Qaeda and commit to continued (and effective) operations against the Islamic State.
The initial objective should be a comprehensive and enduring cease-fire. This approach can provide us a way to consolidate the gains of the past 18 years and achieve our stated objective of ensuring that we will never absorb another attack on our homeland from Afghanistan.
Some may argue that the Taliban cannot be trusted and will never live up to their commitments, and this may be true. But we can put in place measures that will allow us, and the international community, to observe, monitor and enforce whatever agreement is finally reached.
President Trump often highlights the need to "end the endless wars." We should end this one by pursuing the difficult and sometimes messy political and diplomatic process that includes talking, finding compromise and setting conditions to forge new relationships.
I have retired from the United States Army, but soldiers from the 75th Ranger Regiment -- some born after the Sept. 11 attacks -- are still deployed in Afghanistan.
Now is the time to seize a fleeting opportunity and fully support internal Afghan negotiations. We should put ourselves in the position to shift our focus to enforcing peace and greater stability in Afghanistan. Now is indeed the time to bring an end to our endless war.

Texto completo: His partnership with Aaron Spelling gave the world "Charlie's Angels," "Fantasy Island" and many other series. On his own, he created "Blue Bloods."
Leonard Goldberg, who produced the popular television series "Charlie's Angels" and "Fantasy Island" with Aaron Spelling in the 1970s and late in life conceived the hit police drama "Blue Bloods," died on Dec. 4 in a hospital in Los Angeles. He was 85.
His wife, Wendy Howard Goldberg, said the cause was injuries from a fall at his home.
For nearly 60 years, the suave and calm Mr. Goldberg found success as an executive with 20th Century Fox and ABC, where he helped establish the genre of weekly made-for-TV movies.
But he preferred the creative art of producing TV shows. Among the best-known Spelling-Goldberg productions was "Charlie's Angels," which became a pop-culture phenomenon and made a star of Farrah Fawcett-Majors as one of three beautiful female detectives. She left after the first season, but the show remained a hit.
As Mr. Goldberg neared his 80s, "Blue Bloods," which proved to be his longest-running series, made its debut on CBS, in 2010. The show tells the story of the Reagans, a law-enforcement clan led by a New York City police commissioner, played by Tom Selleck. Mr. Goldberg created it as a hybrid of police procedurals, like "Starsky & Hutch," another Spelling-Goldberg production, and "Family," the company's much-praised series about a middle-class family in California.
In developing a series about a strong-willed family that also includes two police officers and a prosecutor, Mr. Goldberg added an unusual touch: Every episode featured a post-church Sunday dinner, with the Reagans talking (and arguing) around the table.
"We had to have something singular, something that would crystallize all of my thoughts about what a family should be," Mr. Goldberg told Shalom TV (now the Jewish Broadcasting Service) in 2014. "I came across the Norman Rockwell painting that celebrated Thanksgiving with a family, and I thought about my own upbringing, with our own Shabbat dinners."
Mr. Selleck, in a phone interview, said that the weekly scene was inviolate to Mr. Goldberg, and that Mr. Goldberg had fought the network to retain it. (He sat on the CBS board for many years.)
"In our first encounter, I said, 'Leonard, there's this eight-page dinner scene that I love, but by the time the networks get it, it'll be cut to two pages,"' Mr. Selleck said. "And he said, 'No, that'll be a set piece for the show."'
He added, "We're on episode 213, and anybody who talks about our show says their favorite part is the family dinner."
Mr. Goldberg was born on Jan. 24, 1934, in Brooklyn. His father, William, made women's coats and suits, and his mother, Jean (Smith) Goldberg, was a homemaker who also raised money for the B'nai B'rith and other charitable organizations.
After graduating from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania in 1955 with a bachelor's degree in economics, Mr. Goldberg spent six months in the executive training program at Bloomingdale's. He disliked it and left after six months, finding a job at ABC in its research department. He then moved briefly to NBC before joining the advertising agency Batten, Barton, Durstine & Osborn.
He returned to ABC in the early 1960s and rose to vice president of daytime programming, introducing "The Dating Game" and "The Newlywed Game" to the lineup.
As Mr. Goldberg told it, he had prodded Chuck Barris, then ABC's director of West Coast daytime programming, to create "The Dating Game," in which a bachelor or bachelorette would choose a date from among three unseen members of the opposite sex after asking them questions.
As he recalled in an interview with the Television Academy Foundation in 2004, he told Mr. Barris: "What do young women like? We're guys, we like girls. They must like guys."
Mr. Goldberg became ABC's vice president of programming in 1966. Over three years in that position he helped develop the made-for-TV movie format out of boredom, by his account, with conventional television series. He also introduced prime-time shows like "Love, American Style," "The Flying Nun" and "The Mod Squad," which Mr. Spelling produced with Danny Thomas.
Mr. Goldberg moved in 1969 to Screen Gems (which later became Columbia Pictures Television), where he was the vice president of production. While there, he read an excerpt in Look magazine from "I Am Third" (1970), the Chicago Bears running back Gale Sayers's book about his friendship with his teammate Brian Piccolo, who died of cancer.
Mr. Goldberg recalled that he wept while reading the article. He called his former protégé at ABC, Barry Diller, and made a deal for Screen Gems to produce a TV movie based on the book, titling it "Brian's Song." Broadcast on ABC in 1971, it was the highest-rated TV movie that season and won five Emmy Awards.
After building Screen Gems into a more powerful force on television, Mr. Goldberg left in 1972 to collaborate with Mr. Spelling. It was a potent partnership that brought popular (if not critically acclaimed) series to ABC. They also produced 35 movies for television.
Mr. Goldberg recalled that his concept for "Fantasy Island" -- about a mysterious tropical resort where visitors have unique adventures -- emerged during a distracted moment in a meeting with ABC executives.
"I was looking out the window, and I was caught by the ABC vice president of programming, who said to me, 'Are we boring you?' I said, 'A little bit,"' Mr. Goldberg told the academy. "And he said, 'Where would you rather be?' I said, 'I'd rather be on a desert island with Charlie's Angels."'
"A lot of people have fantasies," Mr. Goldberg added, "and that's how it began."
He parted with Mr. Spelling after a decade to produce theatrical films like "WarGames" (1983) and"Something About Amelia" (1984), a groundbreaking TV movie about incest starring Ted Danson and Glenn Close. That movie earned Mr. Goldberg his only Emmy Award, for outstanding drama or comedy special, which he shared with Michele Rappaport.
He was lured back into an executive position in late 1986, when Mr. Diller, who had become the chairman of Fox Inc., hired him to be president of 20th Century Fox. While Mr. Diller focused on the newly formed Fox network, Mr. Goldberg oversaw film and TV production.
"I've always wanted to run a movie studio," he told The New York Times when his appointment was announced. "I've done almost everything else in this business."
Films like "Broadcast News," "Big," "Die Hard" and "Working Girl" helped revive the studio, but Mr. Goldberg was unhappy with the bureaucratic details of running it. He preferred creating films and TV shows and resigned in early 1989.
Back on his own, he produced "Sleeping With the Enemy" (1991), "Love Letters" (1999), "Double Jeopardy" (1999) and other movies. He was also credited as an executive producer of the three theatrical "Charlie's Angels" films, the most recent of which was released this year.
In addition to his wife, Mr. Goldberg is survived by his daughter, Amanda Goldberg Raskind; his stepsons, Richard and John Mirisch; five grandchildren; and his brother, Stanley.
The confidence that Mr. Goldberg and Mr. Spelling had in their ability to conceive a new series found an outlet even after their partnership had ended. One day they sat down to a lunch.
"I wonder if we could come up with a show by the end of lunch that we could sell to ABC," Mr. Goldberg recalled Mr. Spelling suggesting to him. "I said, 'Why not?"'
They thought of a series focused on young officers training at a police academy, then called an ABC executive from the restaurant. "We said: 'A lot of people have the last Monet and the last Picasso. We'll give you an opportunity to have one last Spelling-Goldberg production,"' Mr. Goldberg said in the academy interview.
ABC agreed. "T.J. Hooker," starring William Shatner, made its debut in 1982.
For the 2000 film "Charlie's Angels," the director McG paid tribute to Mr. Goldberg by creating scenes from a faux "T.J. Hooker" movie, seen on an airplane movie screen.
Looking at the screen, a character played by LL Cool J sighs and says, "Oh, another movie from an old TV show."

Texto completo: PARIS - France's prime minister said Wednesday that the full retirement age will be increased for the country's youngest, but offered concessions in an ill-fated effort to calm a nationwide protest against pension reforms that critics say will erode the nation's way of life.
The government says it wants to make the pensions system sustainable and simpler but is facing public pressure, including a week of the most debilitating transport strikes in decades.
Major unions were quick to reject the proposals and vowed to strike on.
The day after more than 300,000 people protested across France, metro lines in Paris but two were closed and many train routes remained canceled as unions dig in their heels against President Emmanuel Macron, whom they accuse of shaping policies in favor of the rich.
Prime Minister Edouard Philippe detailed the pension changes in a speech Wednesday, saying bluntly that the French "will need to work longer."
People born after 1974 will have to work until age 64 to get a full pension, instead of 62 previously. Those born before that date will not be affected, he said.
The new scheme is aimed at replacing a complicated pension system that included dozens of special privileges for some sectors, like public transport, with one set of rules.
Philippe said the changes ensure the pension system is "fair and sustainable" for a growing population with a record number of people over 90.
For people entering the workforce, the reforms will only start to apply in 2022, which happens to be the last year of Macron's term.
Nobel laureate Suu Kyi defends Myanmar army in UN court
THE HAGUE, Netherlands - Nobel Peace Prize winner and former political prisoner Aung San Suu Kyi denied Wednesday that Myanmar's armed forces committed genocide, telling the United Nation's top court that the mass exodus of Rohingya people from the country she leads was the unfortunate result of a battle with insurgents.
The image of the former pro-democracy icon appearing before the International Court of Justice to defend the army that kept her under house arrest for 15 years was striking.
Myanmar's accusers have described a deliberate campaign of ethnic cleansing and genocide that drove more than 700,000 Rohingya to neighboring Bangladesh.
Suu Kyi calmly rebuffed allegations that army personnel killed civilians, raped women and torched houses in 2017.
Leaders scramble for votes as UK's ugly campaigning ends
LONDON - Britain's election has been like the country's late-autumn weather: chilly and dull, with blustery outbursts.
On the last day of the campaign, political leaders dashed around the U.K. on Wednesday trying to win over millions of undecided voters who will likely determine the outcome.
Opinion polls suggest Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservatives have a lead over the main opposition Labour Party led by Jeremy Corbyn ahead of Thursday's election.
Britain's first December vote since 1923 for all 650 seats in the House of Commons has been dubbed the Brexit Election. It comes more than two years early in hopes of breaking the political deadlock over the country's stalled departure from the European Union.
Report: Giuliani settles long divorce from his third wife
NEW YORK - Former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and his third wife have reached a settlement in a yearslong court battle that exposed details about their luxurious lifestyle, The New York Times reported.
Giuliani, 75, and his wife, Judith, put an end to their differences and "intend to remain friends in the years to come," Judith Giuliani's divorce attorney, Bernard Clair, told the newspaper.
The couple was married for 15 years.
Throughout the divorce, details about the couple's $230,000 monthly budget became public, including six houses, 11 country club memberships and $12,000 on Rudy Giuliani's cigars.
Giuliani previously was married for 20 years to Donna Hanover. Before that, he was married for 14 years to Regina Peruggi.
YouTube cracks down on racist, sexist insults
SAN FRANCISCO - YouTube is taking another step to curb hateful and violent speech on its site.
The video streaming company said it will now take down videos that lob insults at people based on race, gender expression, sexual orientation or other "protected attributes." The Google-owned company will also prohibit veiled threats of violence, taking a step further into moderating what people can say on the videos they create and upload.
YouTube has been slapped with criticism from politicians, viewers and video creators for the material it allows on - and bans from - the site. The site has been accused of allowing and fostering hate speech and extremism and creating spaces for harassment to linger online, along with other digital sites that allow people to upload their own material, such as Facebook and Twitter.
Chile: Debris found believed to be from missing plane
PUNTA ARENAS, Chile - The Chilean Air Force says it has recovered debris believed to be from a military transport plan carrying 38 people that vanished days earlier en route to Antarctica.
Air Force Gen. Eduardo Mosqueira says "sponge" material was found floating roughly 18 miles from the place the C-130 Hercules last had radio contact.
It had left southern Chile and was flying over Drake Pass, a notoriously turbulent area.
Mosqueira said Wednesday the debris will be analyzed to see if it corresponds to the missing plane. He says the process could take up to two days to confirm.
The C-130 Hercules took off Monday afternoon from a base in far-southern Chile on a regular maintenance flight for an Antarctic base. Radio contact was lost 70 minutes later.
In Niger: About 100 Islamic militants ambushed an army camp in western Niger, a military spokesman said late Wednesday, killing at least 71 soldiers in the deadliest attack on the West African country's forces in years.
The large-scale attack comes amid a surge of assaults on army camps in the Sahel region, which have allowed jihadists to amass weapons and vehicles for their arsenal. Neighboring Mali has seen such an increase in ambushes on its army that it has even closed some of its most remote and vulnerable army outposts.
A Niger army spokesman read the death toll announcement on state TV Wednesday night and said a dozen others had been wounded after the ambush overnight.

The decline of print news is hurting us all

Texto completo: For years, one of the most widely read sections of any newspaper was the obituaries. But judging by a recent Pew Research Center study, we might soon be reading the obituary for print journalism as a whole.
According to the study, newsroom workforces at print newspapers have been cut in half over the past decade. The primary reasons for the decline are obvious: media bias and the rise of online news sources.
The evidence for the latter effect is overwhelming — employment doubled at digital news outlets over the same period. But as for media bias, although conservatives may take delight in seeing left-wing print news outlets fall apart, the result is a short-term negative for our nation.
When readers replaced newspapers with the websites of their choosing, they didn’t end up reading new, unbiased media outlets that were publishing solid journalism. Instead, left-wing readers began reading sites that fed them the news they wanted to hear. Right-wing readers did the same. Rather than replacing “fake news” with real journalism, the decline of print media increased political tribalism by placing an increasing amount of Americans in their echo chambers.
In addition, when the print media began laying off employees, they also began degrading the quality of the product they were selling. Expensive, long-form investigative journalism was replaced by clickbait stories attempting to chase the “Trump bump.” Biased journalism became full-fledged fake news. As a New York Times editor was captured admitting on hidden camera, “The main objective is to grab subscribers. You do that any way that you can.” For many outlets, this meant publishing anti-Trump fan-fiction rather than actual news.
This business model is shameful for any newspaper that takes itself seriously, but it’s undeniably profitable in the short-term. In fact, the New York Times just passed 3.8 million online subscribers.
But what is the long-term plan? Once President Trump is out of office, how will the Times hold the attention of this rabid anti-Trump audience?
The Times and others would do well to learn a lesson from sports journalism. In an era full of clickbait stories about the NFL, NBA, and NHL, sports site The Athletic has shown that there is a real demand for serious journalism with insightful, long-form stories. The site was founded just three years ago, but it already boasts a value of $300 million, with more than 500,000 paying subscribers. Little by little, The Athletic has expanded coverage on an increasing number of sports by hiring talented, well-known writers with their own followings.
Imagine if political journalism were done the same way — rather than pretending to be unbiased while offering left-wing propaganda, news sites could hire talented reporters from a multitude of geographic locations and political persuasions. These journalists could cover a variety of stories from a variety of viewpoints. And as long as their biases were known and their stories were accurate, no one would begrudge them for having a point of view.
Unfortunately, the ultimate echo chambers are the editorial boards of the New York Times, the Washington Post, and the rest of their allies. They’ve spent the past three years making the case that anyone who disagrees with their liberal agenda is “racist, sexist, and anti-gay.” As a result, they couldn’t possibly offer column space to someone spewing “hate speech.”
Their inability to look outside their echo chamber will likely be listed in that future obituary as their cause of death. Such a shame, particularly when their disease could have been cured.

Texto completo: Washington • A top Interior Department official broke a federal ethics rule by improperly meeting with his former employer, a conservative research organization, to discuss the rollback of endangered species protections that the group had been pushing, the department’s internal watchdog said in a report published Tuesday.
The watchdog, the Interior Department’s inspector general, concluded that the official, Douglas W. Domenech, an assistant secretary for the office with stewardship of the nation’s oceans and coasts, violated federal rules in April 2017 when he met with representatives of the Texas Public Policy Foundation, where he was working before he joined the Trump administration, creating the appearance of a conflict of interest.
A separate inspector general investigation made public Tuesday cleared the Interior secretary, David Bernhardt, of charges that he improperly tried to influence or delay a scientific report on the effects of pesticides on endangered species. The inspector general found that Bernhardt had intervened in the writing of the report, which likely delayed its publication and may have changed some of its content. But the investigation concluded that Bernhardt’s actions, which were first reported in a New York Times investigation, did not constitute an ethics violation and that none of his former lobbying clients would have been affected by the outcome of the report.
The Texas Public Policy Foundation, which received substantial funding from Charles and David Koch, the billionaire brothers who have fought environmental regulations, has salted the Trump administration with many of its top officials, elevating its influence and prestige.
Federal ethics laws prohibit government officials from meeting with their former employers for at least a year after they take public office to prevent those employers from improperly influencing the outcomes of public policy. At the Texas Public Policy Foundation, which is based in Austin, Domenech led the group’s Fueling Freedom Project, which aims to “explain the forgotten moral case for fossil fuels” by making the case that preserving oil, natural gas and coal shields the poor from higher energy costs.
Domenech — the father of conservative personality Ben Domenech, a co-founder of The Federalist and the husband of Meghan McCain — also worked on lawsuits designed to undo or weaken federal environmental policies.
His April 2017 meeting with his former employer, which was still pursuing litigation against the Interior Department, was a clear violation of federal rules, the inspector general said.
The report highlighted an email Domenech sent to a Texas Public Policy Foundation attorney shortly after the meeting, saying, “Keep fighting.”
Nicholas Goodwin, a spokesman for the Interior Department, wrote in an email, “While Assistant Secretary Domenech did not do anything partial in meeting with a former employer, the Department concurs with the Inspector General’s report that Assistant Secretary Domenech should have considered the appearance of meeting with a former employer.”
Goodwin said that Domenech has received additional ethics training and guidance, and said the Interior Department considers the matter resolved.
A spokeswoman for the Interior Department’s inspector general declined to comment on the reports.
“This is now a familiar pattern: time and again, Trump appointees at the Department of the Interior think the rules don’t apply to them, and they act accordingly,” said Sen. Tom Udall, D-N.M., who requested the investigation.
“These ethics rules are just common sense, to ensure public officials are actually acting in the public interest, and not in their own interest or in the interests of their prior employers,” Udall said. “The secretary should take strong public action to show that these violations won’t be tolerated, and to make sure other Interior officials pay attention to the rules.”
Rep. Rob Bishop of Utah, the ranking Republican on the House Natural Resources Committee, said the watchdog’s report on Bernhardt exonerated the secretary.
“Contrary to false allegations lodged at David Bernhardt during his Senate confirmation process, the Inspector General has confirmed Secretary Bernhardt never interfered with scientific findings,” he said. “Once again, facts have revealed hyperpartisanship that has blinded Democrats from focusing on real issues rather than attempting to besmirch dedicated public servants in this administration.”
A spokeswoman for the Texas Public Policy Foundation did not respond to a telephone message or email requesting comment.
The investigation of Domenech could shed light on higher-profile inquiries that the Interior Department’s inspector general is conducting into the conduct of about half a dozen of President Donald Trump’s senior appointees at the Interior Department, which oversees the nation’s public lands, waters, parks and endangered species.
Several of the current investigations focus on Bernhardt, a former oil lobbyist who, like Domenech, has also been accused of creating the appearance that he is improperly working on behalf of former clients.
Trump’s first appointee to lead the Interior Department, Ryan Zinke, resigned last year amid similar allegations of unethical conduct.
Bernhardt remains under investigation for allegations that he has personally pushed for the Interior Department to make policy changes that benefited his former clients at the expense of the agency’s own scientific findings and the law, and that he violated federal lobbying laws by continuing to lobby on behalf of a former client after he dropped his lobbying registration.
The report on Domenech is expected to be the first of several investigations of Interior Department officials to be published in the coming months, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Domenech served in the Interior Department during nearly the entire George W. Bush administration, when the agency became ensnared in corruption scandals. In one such scandal, a deputy secretary of the interior, J. Steven Griles, was imprisoned for lying to a Senate committee about his ties to lobbyist Jack Abramoff.
The inspector general’s report noted that, as a former administration official with broad experience in office, Domenech had received ethics training on multiple occasions. But Domenech told investigators that he had not fully understood the ethics rules before attending the meetings with his former employer.
However, in 2018 Domenech read a newspaper article describing similar meetings between an Interior Department official and a former employer, describing such meetings as inappropriate, and then told the agency’s senior lawyers about his meetings.
According to the report, Domenech told the inspector general that he had scheduled two April 2017 meetings with the Texas Public Policy Foundation at the request of the organization’s attorney.
At the meetings, which were also attended by two other top Interior Department officials, the participants discussed two key topics of interest to the foundation: its litigation concerning the Bone Cave harvestman, an endangered orange spider whose preservation had affected Texas land use, and a legal dispute between the Interior Department and Texas residents near the state’s Red River.
This year, the Interior Department announced that it was opening a review to consider removing Endangered Species Act protections on the Bone Cave harvestman, which has been protected under the law since 1988.
Domenech told agency watchdog officials that he was aware of the prohibition on government officials meeting with former employers but believed he was exempt from that rule because, while at the foundation, he had not worked specifically on policy matters involving the spider or the Red River case.
Domenech told investigators that his follow-up “Keep fighting” email, which also focused on the Bone Cave harvestman, was “his way of encouraging the TPPR to continue to pursue its constitutional rights,” the report said, “and he denied that he was commenting on the litigation in any way.”

Texto completo: Durante varios días, se han visto palomas multicolores con sombrero de vaquero pavoneándose en las calles de Las Vegas. Nadie sabe quién equipa a los pájaros, según publica The Washington Post.
El residente de Las Vegas, Bobby Lee, subió a Facebook un video de dos pájaros con sombreros en miniatura, uno rojo y otro rosado, la semana pasada en Facebook . Los “pájaros tienen sombreros, hermano”, exclama en el clip. La publicación, que se compartió ampliamente, rápidamente se hizo viral en Internet y llegó a Mariah Hillman, cofundadora de un rescate local de palomas llamado Lofty Hopes.
Hillman, de 47 años, y la búsqueda de las aves de su hija de 30 años despegaron rápidamente. Comenzaron investigando áreas conocidas, donde repartieron tarjetas de visita y les dijeron a los transeúntes: “Si las ves, aliméntalas. Estamos a solo tres millas de distancia y podemos llegar bastante rápido “.
I finally found one!!! @LasVegasLocally pic.twitter.com/j2u90R2esL
— ???????? ♥????‍♀️ (@kassandraqueenn) December 9, 2019
Desde entonces, Hillman le dijo a The Washington Post, el dúo recibió dos pistas cada día de personas que vieron las palomas, a menudo adjuntando pruebas de video.
Hillman estaba en casa, limpiando jaulas de pájaros, cuando se enteró por primera vez de un avistamiento. Era demasiado tarde para ir a verlo, pero a la mañana siguiente, tan pronto como Hillman entró en la urbanización cerrada, vio la paloma con sombrero rojo, encaramada a la derecha. Ella desaceleró su auto y dijo: “Hola compañero”.
“Estaba sacudiendo la cabeza, tratando de quitarse el sombrero. Definitivamente es pegamento “, le dijo a The Post sobre el adhesivo utilizado en el pájaro. “Tenemos que mudarlo, lo que llevará tiempo”.
Hillman continuó: “Lo único que no los dañaría es el petróleo, que luego lo convierte en una paloma grasa, como los que están alrededor de McDonalds”.
De cualquier manera, la paloma debe quedarse con Hillman por un tiempo. Durante la persecución de dos horas, la exactivista por los derechos de los animales vio un halcón que rodeaba el área, al que llamó “preocupado”.
El misterio permanece
Aunque la gente ha especulado que los sombreros se originaron con un asistente del Rodeo de las Finales Nacionales, que actualmente se lleva a cabo en la ciudad, la asociación ha negado su participación, según The New York Times, y el Departamento de Policía Metropolitana de Las Vegas dijo que “no parece ser un asunto policial “.
Por ahora, Hillman se centra en localizar a las aves y garantizar su seguridad. Hasta ahora, ella y su hija acogieron a Cluck Norris, que luce un sombrero rojo de vaquero, y Coo-lamity James, que usa uno rosa. Otros avistadores mencionaron pájaros con gorras grises y marrones, aunque Hillman aún no los ha encontrado.
El New York Times entrevistó a un ornitólogo de la Universidad de Cornell, Charles Walcott, que se especializa en palomas. “Disfruté el video”, dijo Walcott al Times. “Solo pensé que esas palomas con sombreros eran lindas”.
Walcott también dijo que no está preocupado por las palomas, que actúan con bastante normalidad y no parecen estar angustiados. Los sombreros son “ciertamente lo suficientemente ligeros”, dijo al Times. “A mí me parecen palomas felices. Es difícil saberlo, por supuesto, porque no nos hablarán”.
Las palomas, dijo Hillman, tienen mucho para ellos: se aparean de por vida, los machos y las hembras producen leche y alimentan a sus crías, pueden vivir hasta 20 años en una unidad familiar, y son una de las diez especies que pueden reconocerse en un espejo.
“Son una gran primera mascota”, agregó, y señaló que tienen picos flexibles y no agudos. “Cuando necesitábamos palomas durante la guerra, eran considerados héroes. Ahora que no los necesitamos, se han convertido en alimañas o plagas. Hacemos eso con muchas cosas en esta sociedad, y eso no está bien”. (Editado por Pelayo Escandón)

Texto completo: A scientific breakthrough occurred last week at a Florida high school. Students at J.W. Mitchell high school in New Port Richey dissected a bunch of frogs.
They weren't really frogs, however. They were synthetic. Fake frogs with man-made organs.
It was a Neil Armstrong moment, though to truly appreciate it you need to be a frog or to have sliced one up in the name of science. The latter group includes millions of people who will forever be haunted by the experience.
Well, not everybody was grossed out in my biology class. A few classmates were strangely intrigued by the prospect of poking around inside a frog's belly.
They went on to be doctors or medical researchers. The rest of us went on to lesser careers that did not require smelling formaldehyde.
That educational rite of passage may be ending, which is good for many reasons. Perhaps the only downside is future generations won't be able to share their icky dissection stories.
That means they won't be able to joke about what happened with the cadavers of the frogs and cats when dissection lessons were over.
More than one frog ended up as a hood ornament in the student parking lot. I heard of a teacher who routinely staged a cat cadaver costume contest.
Students would dress up their specimens as football players, beauty queens or the principal. I'll admit I still have to stifle a laugh at the thought of a line of dead cats imitating the Radio City Rockettes.
Note to today's youth - Be Better!
Even a frog deserves death with dignity. In fact, dissected frogs don't deserve death at all.
"Frogs are cruelly stolen from their homes in the wild and are killed specifically for dissection in classrooms," according to PETA.
We shouldn't equate frogs with the Lindbergh baby, but PETA alarmists have a point with this one. Frogs have been around for millions of years, providing a nightly chorus of croaking along rivers and lakes as the sun sets.
There were so many along the Nile River ancient Egyptians depicted the god of fertility as a frog named Heqet. Centuries later, Jim Henson depicted a frog named as Kermit as the lead Muppet, and millions of kids had an amphibian hero.
Kermit's still around, but more than 200 frog species have vanished since 1970. Researchers fear many more will become extinct due to habitat loss, disease, commercial trade and pollution.
Frogs help the ecosystem hum along, acting as predators and as prey. Scientists can gauge the health of rivers, ponds and marshes by the croaking.
"If they go silent, there could be bad stuff happening," Christopher J. Raxworthy, a herpetologist at the American Museum of Natural History, told the New York Times.
PETA estimates 10 million animals are dissected annually in the U.S. The impact of dissection on the frog population is debatable. Even if it's minimal, PETA says it "can foster callousness and insensitivity toward animals and nature."
I suppose dressing a dead cat as Richard Nixon to win a costume contest qualifies. PETA has videos of a teacher juggling dead frogs and students using cat intestines as a jump rope.
Now along comes SynFrog, the life-like model. It's manufactured by SynDaver, which manufacturers all sorts of pretend animals, human body parts and various accessories.
Synthetic and virtual cadavers are the future of dissection. Who knew it would arrive first in Pasco County?
"We are excited to announce that Mitchell High School is the first in the world to use SynFrogs in science labs," Superintendent of Schools Kurt Browning proclaimed in a statement.
A SynFrog costs $150, but it's reusable and more economical than real frogs, which cost $5 to $15. There also are benefits money can't buy.
"Kids are involved," J.W. Mitchell Principal Jessica Schultz said. "They are finger deep in frog guts, but it's all synthetic, so the smell isn't there, the stigma isn't there."
You know what else won't be there? The stories.
Call it one small step for man, one giant leap for frogs that might have become hood ornaments.

A classic Hershey's Kisses ad turns 30 this year - here's how it happened

Texto completo: It's so simple, and it wasn't initially an approved commercial, but it stuck.
The classic ad featuring a hand bell choir of Hershey's Kisses ringing "We Wish You a Merry Christmas" - with a big finish by one particularly enthusiastic little Kiss, so spent by the effort that it wipes its proverbial brow - turns 30 this year.
The ad has not changed since some producers came up with it during their spare time in a San Francisco studio, apart from an update to high-definition CGI animation in 2016 and, in 2018, a digital extension online where one could play the bells and create a new tune, according to Anna Lingeris, a public relations representative at Pennsylvania-based Hershey, one of the world's largest chocolate manufacturers.
Hershey's brand manager at the time, John Dunn, went to San Francisco to meet with ad agency Ogilvy Mather and producer Colossal Pictures and oversee the production of a series of animated Kisses commercials for a new marketing campaign using tabletop stop-motion photography.
Once those planned commercials were done, and having some time to spare before flying back to Pennsylvania, Dunn asked two producers from Colossal Pictures to create a holiday ad spot for Hershey Kisses, according to the Hershey Community Archives. Dunn did not have authorization to make it, according to the archives, but he felt confident he'd be able to convince his boss to run it.
Today, it is the longest-running commercial for the Hershey brand.
It did align with the campaign they were paid to work on, which was called the "whimsy" campaign. It was apparently Dunn who suggested the frantic solo bell finish at the end to "reinforce the whimsy and innocence of the brand identity," according to the archives.
Five years in, a Hershey marketing director told The New York Times that perennial ads like this "don't wear out like normal commercials."
The bells ad joins the ranks of other well-known holiday ads spanning multiple decades. Remember when two goofy M&Ms discovered that Santa was real? That "Christmas Faint" ad had been running since 1996, leaving a 20-year cliffhanger until the company released a sequel in 2017.
A Corona ad without people or dialogue - seconds of nothing but a dim shot of a single cabana surrounded by palm trees, and whistling to "O Tannenbaum," the tune of "O Christmas Tree" - has been running untouched since 1990.
Other ads run the same concept from year to year but choose different characters and a slightly modified spin. The Lexus "December to Remember" campaign, which first aired in 1998, usually features a new family member getting surprised by a new Lexus in some unexpected way.
This year's bells ad started wishing us a "Merry Christmas" online on Nov. 4 and on television Nov. 18.

NEW NORTH AMERICAN TRADE DEAL TAKES A STEP FORWARD IN CONGRESS WITH LABOR'S ENDORSEMENT, GRIPES FROM SEN. TOOMEY

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - The country's largest labor federation on Tuesday endorsed a new North American trade deal negotiated by the Trump administration, a significant boost to get the rewrite of North American Free Trade Agreement across the finish line in Congress as early as next week.
If that happens, expect Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey - a Republican and ardent supporter of lowering trade barriers - to protest loudly.
Mr. Toomey, after a briefing by Robert Lighthizer, the U.S. trade representative, told reporters the Trump administration gave away critical provisions in bargaining with House Democrats, who announced their support along with the AFL-CIO Tuesday morning.
The new agreement, called the the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement or USMCA, "clearly moved way to the left" by including stricter labor protections in Mexico, threatening tariffs, eliminating protections for investors and imposing a expiration date in 16 years unless renewed by Congress, Mr. Toomey said.
"It runs contrary to the principles of a free trade agreement," said Mr. Toomey, who was the only Republican to state his opposition to USMCA during a Senate Finance Committee hearing in July. "Many of the changes are counterproductive."
It's unclear whether Mr. Toomey's colleagues share his frustration and, if so, are willing to block what would be a significant legislative achievement for President Donald Trump.
Passage of the USMCA would notch a major victory for Mr. Trump, who campaigned in 2016 on a promise to tear up trade deals, calling NAFTA, signed into law in 1993, "the worst deal ever."
It would also be a remarkable moment of compromise reached by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., as the House Democrats' impeachment inquiry against Mr. Trump churns on. An hour before meeting with reporters on the USMCA, Ms. Pelosi joined top Democrats to unveil two articles of impeachment against Mr. Trump.
At the USMCA announcement, Ms. Pelosi said she was confident the deal had enough support among Democrats to become law. Months of Capitol Hill negotiations with Mr. Lighthizer had resulted in stronger labor, environmental and enforcement provisions, Ms. Pelosi said.
"It is infinitely better than what was initially proposed by the administration," she said. "It's a victory for America's workers."
Organized labor's support was critical in the Democratically controlled House, and the AFL-CIO's endorsement gives the green light for lawmakers to line up behind the pact. Rep. Mike Doyle, D-Forest Hills, and Rep. Conor Lamb, D-Mt. Lebanon, did not respond to a request for comment as of early afternoon.
Richard Trumka, president of AFL-CIO, said in a statement on Tuesday that the final language is a "vast improvement over both the original NAFTA and the flawed proposal brought forward in 2017."
"President Trump may have opened this deal, but working people closed it," said Mr. Trumka, a Greene County native and longtime leader of the labor federation, which encompasses unions with nearly 13 million members. "Now we have secured an agreement that working people can proudly support."
The AFL-CIO's statement said the final USMCA deal eliminates some of the Trump administration's initial proposals, including loopholes designed to make it harder to prosecute labor violations.
"For the first time, there truly will be enforceable labor standards - including a process that allows for the inspections of factories and facilities that are not living up to their obligations," Mr. Trumka stated.
Mr. Toomey, speaking with reporters on Tuesday, said he was still reading through outline language circulated by House Democrats. But new concessions by the administration regarding labor provisions include "facility-based enforcement of labor obligations" and penalties on goods and services "not produced in compliance with collective bargaining agreements," he said.
"It sure sounds like there could be tariffs or quotas or some kind of penalty imposed on Mexican products if somebody alleges there's a factory not in compliance with collective bargaining," Mr. Toomey said.
He added that "these provisions are meant to diminish the only competitive advantage Mexico has, and that is a low-cost economy, and it has correspondingly lower wages."
The Trump administration also appeared to roll back intellectual property protections for biologic medicines. U.S. law currently requires 12 years of exclusivity on promising new drugs, he said, allowing companies to earn a return on research and development costs.
Mr. Toomey called the move a "complete capitulation" to Democrats, who see the protections as benefiting drug companies and increasing health care costs.
Yet the changes approved by Mr. Trump could build Democratic support in the House for the new trade deal, which governs a massive amount of commerce.
Trade with Canada and Mexico supports 12 million U.S. jobs, with exports supporting 2 million manufacturing jobs, according to the National Association of Manufacturers. Nearly one-third of U.S. agricultural exports go to Canada and Mexico.
Business groups, which have been aggressively marketing USMCA for months in Washington, praised the deal.
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce said "this development will open the door to final approval of USMCA on a bipartisan basis by the end of the year, which will especially benefit American farmers, manufacturers, and small businesses."
The National Mining Association called it "a win not just for mining, but for our manufacturing, technology, energy and defense industries."
In a case of strange bedfellows, unions agreed.
Darrin Kelly, president of the Allegheny County Labor Council, the local chapter of the AFL-CIO, said the USMCA was "without a doubt a win for the American worker."
"The American people need to remember this is a win for the entire country," Mr. Kelly said in a brief interview, "not for a political party."

Texto completo: If your pet tears, chews, or otherwise ruins your stuff, these tips can help you keep your gear like new.
This is why we can't have nice things.
I repeat that phrase when the dog chews up my favorite eyeliner pencil or the cat scratches up the new duvet cover.
Though pet owners have probably been saying this since the dawn of dog domestication, the truth is that pet owners can have nice things. We just need to know how to keep our stuff safe while ensuring that our pets still get the enrichment they deserve.
As the pets writer for Wirecutter, a New York Times company that reviews and recommends products, I've learned a lot about pet supplies and animal behavior. There's a ton of gear out there that keeps our pets from scratching, marking, or chewing on the wrong things. Yet deterrents alone won't keep your belongings in like-new condition. You also need to guide your pet's instinctual behaviors toward constructive outlets, like pet-friendly toys, and reinforce their good manners so they don't revert to their troublesome ways. Here's how.
Set them up for success
If I forget to close the bathroom door before I leave for work, I'll come home to find my dog Sutton sitting on the tile floor, shredding a roll of toilet paper. Catching my dog in the act is one way to save my stuff from total annihilation, but I'm not always around to stop her.
It's easier to keep my dog from trashing the place if I set her up for success from the start. First, I create roadblocks by stashing the toilet paper in a secure cabinet. Then I redirect her chewing impulses to a constructive outlet by leaving a chew stick on her bed before I head out the door.
The roadblock makes it harder for a pet to perform an unwanted behavior, and the enrichment activity allows them to safely act on their animal instincts. Regular exercise is a great form of enrichment that's free. It's also a bonding opportunity, and it will tire them out so they're less likely to act out when you're away.
If you want to up the fun factor, consider a monthly pet subscription box, which provides an assortment of toys and treats that are attractive to most pets. My pet-owning colleagues and I spent an entire summer testing 73 different kits, and we like the Meowbox for cats and the PupJoy Box for dogs for the quality and value of their gear and their flexible shipping options.
Keep cats from tearing up your stuff
"Stit, stit, stit, scratch" is a familiar tune in my home. It's an overture that sounds whenever my cat Tanzie drags her nails down the frame of my sofa or bed. The instinct is understandable, because cats scratch to relieve stress, mark their territory, sharpen their claws, and as a form of play.
To keep my cat from scratching the furniture, I deploy Pioneer Pet's "Sticky Paws" furniture strips. The long pieces of double-sided tape are more durable and wider than the kind you buy from Staples, and they cling securely to surfaces and don't leave a residue behind when removed. I stick them to the side of the sofa, on the edges of curtains, or on baseboards to keep bad scratching habits at bay.
Then I direct my cat's scratching impulses to a cat scratcher placed near her favorite scratching spots. I've tested dozens of cat scratchers with the help of 74 cats and kittens at a local rescue group, and these are my favorite scratching posts.
Prevent pets from peeing on everything
Pets sometimes pee where they're not meant to -- whether it's because of poor training, a behavioral problem, or just an accident. And in a household full of stuff, it can be challenging to find just where the stench originates. Directing that behavior onto pet-friendly alternatives and reinforcing your pet's good behavior with treats or praise will help your belongings stay pee-free.
Pads like the Iris Neat 'n Dry aid in housebreaking dogs who think everything in sight is a tree, and they work well for elderly dogs who need a designated place to go indoors. The pads absorb liquids quickly, turning urine into a gel, so your dog won't track pee-soaked paws through your home. Sutton learned the difference between a training pad and the rug at lightning speed whenever I fed her a pea-sized serving of cheese each time she used the pads or peed outdoors.
Cats who sneak behind the sofa to urinate can be dissuaded if you place a strip of aluminum foil back there (because they hate unfamiliar textures). But if they continue to relieve themselves nearby, they're probably protesting a change in their environment -- like if you switched to a scented cat litter or a smaller, hooded litter box for human convenience. Reverting back to your cat's bathroom preferences may be a quick, inexpensive fix -- as is scooping the litter box daily or having enough litter boxes in a multi-cat home. The A.S.P.C.A. offers a thorough explanation on litter box issues.
Other times, marking behavior can be a sign of a bigger concern, such as stress or pain. Synthetic pheromone sprays and diffusers can reduce territorial marking and alleviate newfound stress, say, if you've recently moved or added a new pet to the home. Wirecutter likes Feliway products for cats and Adaptil products for dogs.
But if your pet howls when they're marking, or you see blood in their urine, it's best to get them to the vet to rule out a urinary tract infection or other medical concerns.
Stop them from chewing on your things
Puppies and kittens are both prone to snacking on unattended, tasty-looking USB-C charging cables, and those resulting frayed cords may damage your equipment with improper power flow, are fire hazards, and can cause electrocution. Keep your home-office buddy safe by wrangling tangled-up cords with reusable cable ties, cable sleeves, and a power strip hider. Then lift them out of paw's reach and secure them with a wall hook or tape them to the underside of your desk.

Cats and dogs who love to chew on furniture legs, door frames, or houseplants may be deterred by a foul-tasting spray like Grannick's Bitter Apple. I've had mixed results with the nontoxic concoction over the years, but some Wirecutter employees swear by it. (If your pet is particularly prone to gnawing on plants, be sure to consult the ASPCA's list of harmful plants.)
You can stop cats from hopping on countertops and stealing food if you regularly clean surfaces with a citrus-scented cleaning spray, because the scent repels most cats. (Keep in mind that household cleaners are toxic to pets, so keep cleaners out of their reach.) Or cover the counters in a texture that's alien to them, like aluminum foil or cardboard coated in double-sided sticky tape. Then place a counter-height cat tree nearby so your cat can still pretend like they're lounging on Pride Rock. Slather the tree in some Yeowww Catnip or leave treats on it. After a few days, your cat will love the new perch and won't give that kitchen countertop a second glance.
Pets who rummage through the garbage can often be thwarted by a lidded trash can. The best small-space trash can I've found is the Simplehuman 10-Liter Profile Step Can. The lid stays secure, and the bin never tips over, even after you slam the foot pedal. It's also the only compact, lidded trash can that my small dog can't open on her own. For bigger rooms, Wirecutter's recommendations for kitchen trash cans are just as good. And if you overstuff the trash basin until the lid won't shut, there's a simple hack to keep it secure: a short bungee cord wrapped across the top.
Finally, make sure your pets have access to things they can chew on, and rotate use of those items to keep pets engaged. Think treat-filled rubber chew toys (like Kongs stuffed with peanut butter), treat-dispensing balls, and durable squeaker toys for dogs, and crinkle balls and chirping toys for cats.
Look beyond the pet gear
It's enticing to buy new gear for your pet in the hope of quickly fixing the problem, but it's not the right solution for every pet or household. Destructive behavior in a pet occurs for many reasons -- everything from a lack of exercise and pure boredom to territorial aggression and separation anxiety.
I've written about how to find an accredited dog trainer and when it's the right time to seek a professional's help (hint: the sooner, the better). Consulting an expert ensures that you're not mistaking a serious behavioral or medical issue as animal silliness, and that you're tackling your pet's destructive tendencies head-on.

The Perverse Servility of Bill Barr

Texto completo: How does Trump's attorney general keep a straight face?
Donald Trump famously said that he could shoot somebody in the middle of Fifth Avenue and not "lose any voters." I don't know about that. But I'm confident that he wouldn't lose Bill Barr.
Execution privilege, Barr would probably call it. He'd release a statement or hold a news conference to say that Trump had a spastic trigger finger or was triggered by Adam Schiff or was set up by those dastardly Ukrainians, who are never up to any good. Such is the magnitude of Barr's servility, the doggedness of his deference. He's the president's moral launderer. Trump does evil, and Barr washes him clean.
As attorney general, he's supposed to be the nation's lawyer. But he has bought into the autocratic delusion that Trump equals America, that national interest and presidential prerogative are inextricably intertwined. So he's Trump's advocate, come hell or high crimes, as surely as Pat Cipollone or Rudy Giuliani is.
On Monday, showing fresh contempt for the people who work under him in the Justice Department, Barr renounced a determination by the department's inspector general that the F.B.I.'s investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia was legitimate and that anti-Trump bias was not its animating force. He did this instantly.
And then, on Tuesday, did it again, with even less subtlety and more sanctimony. "It was a travesty," he said of the investigation, and he was speaking not just of the sloppiness and haste of some of the F.B.I.'s actions, with which the inspector general also took issue. He was dismissing the whole effort as rotten.
It was an eerie echo of his efforts last spring, when he sought to neuter Robert Mueller's findings about the Trump campaign's openness to Russian help and the president's attempts to obstruct justice. Give Barr points for consistency. He has bought fully into the idea that the zeal of Trump's detractors matters more than the presidents' abuses of power.
But what of the Constitution? What of common decency? Barr isn't concerning himself with those. To do so would call into question the honor of serving in this administration, the compliment of holding the job that Trump gave him. And he wants that compliment. That pedestal. He prefers to see himself as a holy warrior than as an unholy dupe.
To appreciate his perspective, you must travel back two months, to the University of Notre Dame, where he delivered a speech that garnered some headlines but not nearly enough of them.
You should read it. You should savor its grandiosity -- it has references to the dawn of homo sapiens, the twilight of the Judeo-Christian order, Edmund Burke, James Madison -- so that you can understand his current overreach, born of his certainty that he knows better than the rest of the body politic and is called to heal us.
You should note his remarks' obsession with morality and you should try not to laugh, the same way you stifle chuckles when you're reminded that Mike Pompeo is a putatively worshipful Christian and you try to square that with how he abetted the persecution of Marie Yovanovitch, leaves his State Department charges twisting in the wind and genuflects before a false prophet. In Trump he trusts.
You should dwell on the part of Barr's jeremiad where he says that "men are subject to powerful passions and appetites and, if unrestrained, are capable of ruthlessly riding roughshod over their neighbors and the community." Ruthless? Roughshod? That's Trump in an alliterative nutshell, but Barr seemed to be perversely oblivious to that. He was making a case for Trump's presidency.
The wonder of this wretched moment has never been the existence and stench of a bad egg in the Oval Office. That's hardly strange, given how ably shamelessness serves ambition. The wonder is how many other bad eggs the current president has assembled or hatched. The wonder is this fluffy, funky omelet of unscrupulousness.
All these supposedly godly men -- Barr, Pompeo, Mike Pence, Ben Carson, Rick Perry and more -- cluster around such a demonstrably godless one. They rationalize that Trump's indulgence of certain religious factions absolves him of his sins. Barr is the principal agent of that absolution.
He's also a paragon of hypocrisy, telling Pete Williams of NBC News that the F.B.I. investigation of Trump's campaign was an ominous abuse of government power for partisan aims. That description better suits the conduct for which Trump is about to be impeached. I don't know how Barr kept a straight face.
Actually, I do. Since betrothing himself to Trump, he has had ample practice. In the Notre Dame speech, without any palpable sense of irony, he urged a "moral renaissance" and delivered this priceless line: "No society can exist without some means for restraining individual rapacity." I agree.
In our society, impeachment is one of those means. The law is another. And if Barr could dig out his conscience from under all those layers of ego, he'd see that the rapacious individual in direst need of restraint is the one he's letting roam free.

THE WORLD; Mexico's former security chief held; U.S. accuses Genaro Garcia Luna of taking millions in bribes from Sinaloa drug cartel.

Texto completo: As Mexico's top cop who helped launch the country's war against drug cartels more than a decade ago, Genaro Garcia Luna won the trust of U.S. counter-narcotics officials and was celebrated for rooting out graft among police ranks.
"In the fight against corruption, we won't give in to pressures," he told journalists in 2007 after announcing that he was firing hundreds of federal police commanders.
U.S. officials now say that Garcia Luna himself was corrupt.

He was arrested in Dallas on Monday and charged with taking millions of dollars in bribes from the Sinaloa drug cartel that was once headed by Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman.
Garcia Luna, who led Mexico's Federal Investigation Agency from 2001 to 2005 and served as secretary of public security from 2006 to 2012, is one of the highest-ranking Mexican officials indicted on drug trafficking charges in a U.S. court.
Officials claim that on at least two occasions, he accepted briefcases from cartel couriers stuffed with at least $3 million in cash.
In exchange, they allege, Garcia Luna provided the Sinaloa cartel with safe passage of its drugs as well as sensitive details about law enforcement investigations into the group and information about rival gangs.
Garcia Luna was charged with three counts of conspiracy to traffic cocaine and one count of making false statements, according to an indictment unsealed Tuesday. It's the latest in a string of U.S. cases targeting the Mexican narcotics industry, including this year's conviction of Guzman on trafficking and murder charges.
U.S. Atty. Richard Donoghue said in a statement that the Garcia Luna case "demonstrates our resolve to bring to justice those who help cartels inflict devastating harm on the United States and Mexico regardless of the positions they held while committing their crimes."
According to the indictment, the bribery occurred sometime after 2001, the year Garcia Luna became the head of the Federal Investigation Agency under newly elected President Vicente Fox.
The election of Fox, a former Coca-Cola executive from the National Action Party, ended more than seven decades of rule by the Institutional Revolutionary Party, and it was widely hailed as an unprecedented democratic opening and an opportunity to stamp out corruption.
Under the previous political system, cartels frequently paid Mexican officials in order to easily traffic drugs north to the United States. Fox and his young protege Garcia Luna presented themselves as reformers intent on professionalizing Mexico's institutions.
When Felipe Calderon took office as president in 2006, also under the banner of the National Action Party, Garcia Luna became the public face of the president's controversial war on drug cartels.
During that time, Garcia Luna worked closely with U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration officials and was tasked with building a federal police force.
A flattering 2008 profile in the New York Times Magazine described Garcia Luna as "something of a wunderkind," a man with a "square jaw, squat build and crew cut" who was savvy with technology and committed to cleaning up Mexico's notoriously corrupt police.
"We are obligated to confront crime," Garcia Luna said when asked whether Mexico should consider making deals with cartels to reduce crime. "That is our job, that is our duty, and we will not consider a pact."
But as time went on, Garcia Luna began to face scrutiny for his own behavior.
There was an embarrassing episode in which he was found to have staged a police raid of kidnapping victims for a television crew. And then there was the question of his numerous luxury homes, which seemed out of reach for someone with a civil servant's salary.
U.S. officials say records show that by the time Garcia Luna moved to the U.S. in 2012, he had amassed a fortune of millions of dollars.
Prominent Mexican journalist Anabel Hernandez took note of his personal wealth and published a book in 2010 alleging that Garcia Luna accepted bribes in exchange for protecting the Sinaloa cartel. She later filed complaints with Mexico's human rights commission accusing Garcia Luna of trying to hire federal police officers to kill her.
The bribery claims against Garcia Luna reemerged during Guzman's drug trafficking and murder trial last year.
At the trial, former cartel member Jesus Zambada Garcia testified that he twice met Garcia Luna in a restaurant and gave him a briefcase filled with cash.
Zambada Garcia said the first payoff occurred in 2005, when Garcia Luna was the head of the Federal Investigation Agency, and the second one a year later, after Garcia Luna had been promoted to secretary of public security.
Garcia Luna has denied those claims in the past.
He did not enter a plea to the indictment at his initial appearance in a Dallas courtroom this week, according to John Marzulli, spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office. Calls to Garcia Luna's attorney were not returned.
Garcia Luna obtained legal residency in the U.S. several years ago, according to a detention memo filed by the U.S. attorney's office.
In 2018, he applied to become a naturalized U.S. citizen. In the detention memo, prosecutors alleged that on his citizenship application Garcia Luna "made materially false statements denying his past criminal conduct."
If he is convicted of accepting bribes, it would be a major stain on the legacies of the two presidents whom he served.
Analysts say it would especially hurt Calderon, who made combating drug traffickers his main policy priority and who has frequently criticized the less militarized approach of current President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.
"It is a massive blow for Calderon," said Carlos Bravo Regidor, a political analyst. "It strips away any authority he had left to speak about security matters."
Bravo also described the arrest as a boon to Lopez Obrador, who has frequently described his predecessors as corrupt.
"This is the U.S. going after Calderon's public security secretary," Bravo said.
It is not the first time a top Mexican official has been brought down by drug trafficking allegations.
In 1997, Mexican anti-drug czar Jose de Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo was arrested for working with the Juarez cartel. Like Garcia Luna, he had once been celebrated as Mexico's best hope in fighting crime.

Texto completo: When her daughters, Olivia Jade and Isabella, were younger, Lori Loughlin and her husband Mossimo Giannulli loved to give them a white Christmas by packing the family up and flying — presumably by private jet — to Colorado so they could all play in the snow and ski.
More recently, though, the Giannulli family has stayed in Los Angeles in their Bel Air mansion, as the former Hallmark Channel star told Parade magazine in 2017. But Loughlin said they still enjoyed other holiday traditions: picking out a tree and decorating it. She said she and her fashion-savvy, social media influencer daughters also loved to go shopping.
“It’s really about getting together with family,” Loughlin said.
This year, the former “Full House” star and her family again will be in Los Angeles, but things will be far less jolly. That’s because Loughlin, 55, is facing the possibility of years in prison for her alleged role in the college admissions scandal and has been hunkering down in rooms with lawyers to prepare her defense, Us Weekly is reporting in its new issue.
The actress best known as wholesome Aunt Becky is participating in “grueling” mock trials, essentially rehearsals for what could be the biggest, most consequential performance of her life: defending herself in federal court against bribery, fraud and money laundering charges.
According to Us Weekly, Loughlin, 55, is “adamant” that she wants to testify, even though it’s never a requirement for defendants to take the stand and defense attorneys often advise against it.
“Lori has no choice at this point but to take this to trial and hope for an acquittal or a hung jury,” a source told Us Weekly.
Loughlin apparently believes she can convince a jury that she’s a sympathetic figure, another insider said. She and her husband are charged with paying $500,000 in bribes to get Olivia Jade, 20, and Isabella, 21, fraudulently admitted to the University of Southern California.
Perhaps the veteran TV actress and media personality hopes she can use her star power and comfort in the spotlight to present herself as a loving mom who thought she was doing right by her daughters. Loughlin and her fashion designer husband also are expected to argue that they were duped into engaging in a bribery scheme concocted by college admissions consultant William “Rick” Singer.
“She feels they’ll believe that the accusations against her don’t merit criminal prosecution, that she truly thought she was making a legal contribution to charity,” the insider told Us Weekly.
Loughlin and Giannulli reportedly will argue that they believed the money they paid to Singer and to his alleged accomplices at USC were legitimate donations to Singer’s education nonprofit and to the school’s athletic programs.
“Mossimo strongly believes they were victims of a con and did nothing wrong,” an insider previously told Us Weekly.
But as much as Loughlin and Giannulli agree on some issues related to their “united front” defense, they disagree on others. That includes Loughlin’s reported earlier desire to strike a plea deal with prosecutors. Now, Loughlin wants to testify, and her husband doesn’t think it’s a good idea at all, Us Weekly reported.
“Mossimo doesn’t want to testify, but will be forced to if Lori does,” the insider told the outlet.
Another worry for the couple is that Olivia Jade and Isabella may be called as prosecution witnesses to testify against their parents. The indictment alleges that Olivia Jade and Isabella participated in the bribery scheme by posing for photos on rowing machines. The photos were used for fake athletic profiles that Singer and his accomplices created in order to present the sisters to admissions officers as crew team recruits.
The prospect of Olivia Jade and Isabella testifying terrifies Loughlin, Us Weekly reported.
“Lori’s bereft when she talks about the girls being forced to testify at their trial,” the insider said. “She doesn’t understand how it got to this point.”
Legal experts say that the decision to testify is always up to a defendant. Juries are instructed to not hold it against defendants when they don’t take the stand.
“There are so many risks to testifying that every attorney worth his salt thinks long and hard about recommending it,” according to a post on AbovetheLaw.com. “No matter what the prosecutor’s evidence, if a defendant testifies that is what will determine the verdict.”
When a defendant testifies, she loses her right to remain silent. It also shifts the burden of proof, which normally is on the prosecution, the legal site said in its post. After a defendant testifies, juries must now look at two “stories” of the case.
“Whether the prosecution made its case or not, if they don’t like how the defendant came off, either because they don’t believe him or just don’t like him, they’ll generally convict,” the post said.
Defense attorneys may see an advantage to putting certain defendants on the stand, notably professional, educated defendants in white-collar cases who have no prior criminal history, the New York Times said. Attorneys may believe they can adequately prepare these defendants to put their cases in the best light.
“The problem in calling the defendant to testify is the second act: cross-examination,” the New York Times said. “Prosecutors often can hardly contain themselves at the thought of getting a shot at the defendant.”
The prosecutor’s strategy usually involves making the defendant uncomfortable and forcing her to respond to questions she may not want to answer, which puts her credibility on the line, the Times added.
For an attorney to decide whether to put a client on the stand, “it comes down to figuring out how well the defendant can perform on the witness stand, particularly cross-examination, as measured against the strength of the government’s case.”
If it’s a matter of “performing,” Loughlin may have an advantage, since performing in TV and in films has been her livelihood for several decades.
In that sense, Loughlin has begun to treat her trial preparation like a “full-time job,” doing the mock trials, meeting with her lawyers or discussing strategy over email,” Us Weekly reported.
Still, the actress also realizes that this could be her last Christmas at home, if the trial doesn’t go her way. For that reason, Loughlin also is trying to spend as much time with her husband and daughters as possible, Us Weekly said. After all, she also once said, “It’s important to make the effort to see your family around the holidays.”

Trump to sign executive order defunding colleges that fail to fight anti-Semitism

Texto completo: President Trump is expected to sign an executive order that will allow the administration to cut funding from colleges and universities that have failed to quell anti-Semitism on their campuses.
Trump’s order will be delivered on Wednesday, according to the New York Times. The order reclassifies Judaism as a race or nationality, affording Jews Title XI anti-discrimination protections under the 1964 Civil Rights Act.
The boycott, divestment, and sanctions movement calls for cracking down on Israel for its treatment of Palestinians living in Israeli-controlled territory. Congress passed a bipartisan condemnation of BDS as a movement that "promotes principles of collective guilt, mass punishment and group isolation, which are destructive of prospects for progress towards peace."
The BDS movement has gained traction on college campuses in recent years. The movement, along with a rise in anti-Semitic attacks against Jews, has motivated lawmakers on both sides to push for legislation through Congress similar to Trump’s executive order.
David Krone, who was chief of staff to Sen. Harry Reid, applauded the expected move by Trump.
"I know people are going to criticize me for saying this, but I have to give credit where credit is due," Krone said.

Texto completo: Bethlehem buildings don't
fit historic neighborhood
I thought the Skyline West project in Bethlehem had the Tasteless Architecture Award wrapped up, but incredibly a late entry at 548 N. New St. may win. Both are by the same developer/design team. Apparently their aesthetic was greatly influenced by early episodes of "The Jetsons."
These proposed buildings are in or adjacent to the Historic District of Bethlehem. In researching how it is possible that these buildings could be approved, I found that City Council, the Planning Board and the Zoning Commission have no say over design, unless the building is in the Historic District.
Not to pick on Bethlehem, the same group has a similar building proposed for Easton, also in a historic area. Looks like an alien structure giving birth, waiting for the mother ship to call them home. Neighborhood residents appearing before Easton's Historic District Commission opposed the project. Hopefully, Easton will listen to them.
I hope the people of Bethlehem will Google these buildings, their locations and voice their concerns to the city.

Help keep Postal
Service carriers safe
The holiday season is approaching fast and shopping online has never been more popular. Extra online shopping means more packages delivered by the U.S. Postal Service. We expect to deliver over 800 million packages between Thanksgiving and New Year's Day throughout the country.
To accommodate the extra volume, carriers will be out in the mornings, evenings and on Sundays. And their aim is to complete their rounds safely so they, too, can enjoy the holiday season.
We are asking customers to be aware of the additional times carriers might be at their doors. It would help if customers left their lights on and kept pets restrained.
And if it snows, please make sure walkways, steps and porches are clear.
With the extra bustle and early darkness, please be aware of our vehicles driving slowly and carriers exiting vehicles to deliver packages.
Please be extra cautious when passing a postal vehicle.
The USPS employees of Easton take pride in delivering the holidays for our customers. Thank you for helping our employees to do it safely.

Impeachment hearings
were a comedy show
After watching the Judiciary Committee's impeachment hearings on Dec. 4, I think this would win an Oscar as a good comedy show.
I was taught to believe that a person is innocent until proven guilty. Well apparently the Democrats on the committee, including our own congresswoman, Madeleine Dean, have made up their minds.
The Democrats had as their witnesses three professors from liberal colleges. They sounded like they also were Trump haters. The ranking member of the committee asked Chairman Nadler to answer a few questions, which he declined.
I can see the impeachment as a slam dunk for the Democrats. All this time and money spent trying to win the 2020 election. Trump wanted to drain the swamp, which you see these congressional members are resisting.
Remember Russian Chairman Nikita Khrushchev said we can't beat the United States militarily but can defeat them from within. Let's take back our country and vote these people out of office in 2020.

Republicans' defense of
Trump doesn't make sense
Does anybody wonder, if as Republicans are saying, Trump withheld aid to the Ukraine because of a "deep-seated, genuine and reasonable skepticism" of the Ukraine due to its history of corruption, why would he want them to investigate an American citizen and their own interference in an American election?

Democrats should offer
real world solutions
A recent commentary by David Von Drehle of The Washington Post ("Working class voters don't want Democrats' grand plans," Dec. 5, The Morning Call) was dead on. The reason Democrats still struggle to connect with middle-class voters is all their grand schemes always end up with negative consequences for those who end up paying for them.
Their "trust me I know what's good for you" ends up being way scarier than anything Trump might say or do. Come up with real world solutions and I may start paying attention to your message.

Diplomats showed love
of country at hearings
Because too many people lack the time to read more than headlines in newspapers, the impeachment hearings have given the nation information about what has been happening since the last election in the nation and the world. Career diplomats caring little about party affiliation gave testimony without bias.
Names like Taylor, Yovanovitch, Vindman, Sondland and Hill will be remembered for their love of and service to our country.
Dec. 4's expert legal scholars (Karlan, Feldman, and Gerhardt) clearly and simply explained with precision and compelling rationale why impeachment must be a given. Informing the millions watching why avoiding the impeachment investigation would be a mistake, they cautioned that our present fragile democracy hangs in the balance.
Anyone watching and listening to them but not having the time or inclination to investigate the complexities and chaos of government matters should have had no problem deciding whether this impeachment is just a lot of nonsense or is a legitimate threat to our democratic process, and especially the next election.

Senators could follow
surgeon general's example
C. Everett Koop, the U.S. surgeon general, stood up to big tobacco. His 1988 Report of the Surgeon General had a tough anti-smoking stance.
Smoking rates fell from 33% of the American public to 26% under Koop's leadership, according to The New York Times. Before Congress required cigarette warnings, my mother asked her doctor, "Is it alright to keep smoking during my pregnancy?" The doctor said there was no reason to quit. As that baby, I find his reply mystifying.
Will children born today be puzzled at society's complacency at carbon dioxide levels over 400 parts per million? The levels of carbon dioxide and lung health problems of Americans provide enough information for lawmakers to act. Now is Sens. Casey's and Toomey's opportunity to support Senate Bill 3791, the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act, which offers steps for lowering carbon dioxide levels.
Just over 30 years ago, Koop completed his term as surgeon general. Are Casey and Toomey up to the challenge of making strides to improve the lung health of Americans as Koop did?

Nike Workers Protest Company's Treatment of Women; Employees march as building named after disgraced coach Alberto Salazar is reopened

Texto completo: Nike Inc. employees staged a protest over the company's treatment of women on the same day the sportswear company reopened a headquarters building named after the disgraced running coach Alberto Salazar.
A flier circulating among employees read, "Join us for a campus walk to celebrate what women bring to sport and to raise awareness of how Nike can support our female athletes and employees."
Employees marched Monday morning at the company's Beaverton, Ore., headquarters in an event not sanctioned by the company. Some held up placards saying, "Empower Women." Several senior executives joined the employees and engaged them in a dialogue, said people familiar with the event.
"We respect and welcome employees' feedback on matters that are important to them," a Nike spokesman said. "The flier prepared by some employees was not officially distributed by Nike."
Buildings on the sprawling Nike headquarters are named after famous athletes with Nike connections, including the golf great Tiger Woods and soccer star Mia Hamm. Mr. Salazar, a track coach whose name is on a large office building, has been suspended from the sport for four years on doping charges. Mr. Salazar has said he planned to appeal the doping ban. He has disputed allegations from some former female athletes that he has mistreated them.
Nike has been dealing with concerns about its workplace culture for more than a year. In early 2018, a group of women circulated a survey to protest inappropriate behavior by men at the sneaker company as well as pay disparity and gender imbalance in the top ranks. Later that year, Nike replaced several senior executives, and Chief Executive Officer Mark Parker apologized at an all-hands meeting , pledging to improve the workplace culture.
More recently, Nike has been embroiled in controversy surrounding Mr. Salazar, a coach who has been associated with the company for years. Mr. Salazar received a four-year suspension for orchestrating and facilitating prohibited doping conduct following an investigation by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency.
The running prodigy Mary Cain told the New York Times recently that during her time with the Nike Oregon Project, Mr. Salazar's now-defunct elite training group, she missed her period for three years after coaches pressured her to lose weight. On Monday, she commented on the march, saying Nike needed to let its employees and community talk freely. "Stop the intimidation," she said on Twitter.
The Nike coach said he was sorry his frank discussions with athletes caused hurt feelings but disputed that he encouraged female athletes to maintain an unhealthy weight.
Nike has defended Mr. Salazar, himself a former elite runner and a Boston and New York City marathon champion. He is a close friend of Nike's co-founder, Phil Knight, both of whom are alumni of the track-and-field program at the University of Oregon. The company has said it is conducting an investigation into Mr. Salazar's treatment of athletes.
On Oct. 1, Mr. Parker sent an email to Nike employees in which he said the company would never condone cheating and underscored his support for Mr. Salazar. "As for Alberto, it's clearly a difficult time for him, his family and his athletes," the CEO wrote. "I think it's important that you know we looked into these allegations and did not find that he violated any rules."
Mr. Parker said on Oct. 10 that the company was disbanding the Nike Oregon Project. About two weeks later, Mr. Parker said he would step down as CEO in January and become executive chairman. Nike said Mr. Parker's decision to leave the CEO role was unrelated to the Nike Oregon Project.

Texto completo: MIAMI - In plain sight of art aficionados and influencers, a prankster removed a $120,000 banana from an Art Basel exhibition in Miami Beach, Florida, on Saturday, peeled it and then ate it.
It happened on the second-to-last day of the art show, where much fuss and head scratching this week has been over a solitary banana - an overripe one - duct-taped to a wall.
Three buyers paid between $120,000 and $150,000 for this week for limited-edition pieces featuring a single banana, created by artist Maurizio Cattelan and titled “Comedian.” Each came with a certificate of authenticity and replacement instructions, which perhaps should have included a disclaimer: for display only. The bananas were bought at a local grocery store. No instructions were given on what to do as the banana ages.
Shortly before 2 p.m. Saturday, a New York City-based performance artist, David Datuna, peeled the taped banana from the wall and devoured it, an Instagram video posted by Datuna showed.
He grinned and raised the half-eaten banana as if making a toast.
Another video posted on Twitter showed Datuna appearing to be escorted out of the Galerie Perrotin space as bemused and stupefied art patrons watched.
But a spokeswoman for Galerie Perrotin, which represents Cattelan, said in an interview Saturday that the gallery was not taking any action against Datuna.
“It’s all in good spirits,” the spokeswoman said. “Perrotin is not pressing any legal charges.”
Gallery officials replaced the banana with another one, saying that the artwork was not destroyed and that the banana was simply an “idea.”
3D-printed cocktails, a traffic jam sculpture made of hundreds of tons of sand and more celebrity sightings than a Kardashian Christmas party were all part of over-the-top festivities during the week in Miami, but it was a banana that stole the show.
On Friday night, art collector Wayne Boich hosted a lavish dinner at his home that included Dan Marino, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh. The after-party crowd, including Floyd Mayweather, Hannah Bronfman, and Alesso, watched a performance by Wyclef Jean, who did a throwback to the Fugees with “Ready or Not,” and later brought dozens of girls onstage to dance with him before passing the mic to “Country Grammar” singer Nelly. Rapper 2 Chainz closed out the night.
Across town, rapper Travis Scott didn’t take the stage until 3:30 a.m. at a sold-out performance at 24-hour nightclub E11even. Scott stood on top of the DJ booth tossing dollar bills into the crowd and yelling at partygoers to put away their phones and enjoy the moment.
The city of Miami Beach commissioned a million-dollar traffic jam by artist Leandro Erlich. It took 330 tons of sand to construct 66 life-sized sculptures of cars and trucks stuck in an imaginary traffic jam on the oceanfront of popular Lincoln Road. The installation alludes to Florida’s fragile position in the large universal canvas, touching on climate crisis and rising sea levels.
The Shore Club South Beach also focused on global warming where a 36-foot-long floating ice sculpture inside the pool spelled out the words “HOW DARE YOU.” The piece, titled “Climate Meltdown” by artist Rubem Robierb, lasted approximately eight hours.
Photographer David Yarrow’s picture of real-life “Wolf of Wall Street” Jordan Belfort sold for $200,000. The piece was signed by director Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio.
Bulleit’s novel 3D-printed bar also drew a curious crowd, where guests watched a robotic arm disperse microscopic drops of liquid into drinks in a pre-set pattern. The whiskey maker has printed more than 7,800 cocktails since partnering with a robotics engineer.
On Saturday, G-Eazy performed poolside at the Maxim magazine party, surprising guests when he brought rapper Wale onstage to perform their song, “Fashion Week,” together.
Haute Living hosted a party for Fat Joe’s new album “Family Ties.” Wearing a baby blue track suit, the rapper entertained guests including DJ Khaled, Fabolous, Jeezy and Too Short.
“We grew up in the projects and now we in a 100 million dollar house rapping about our history,” he told the crowd before pulling Swizz Beatz onstage to perform.
At various clubs over the weekend, Lil Wayne, A$AP Rocky, Rick Ross and 2 Chainz performed. Sean Penn and DiCaprio partied late night at Rockwell x 1 Oak, where Gucci Mane took the stage. Brody Jenner, Meek Mill and Too Short hung out at LIV to hear Alesso play.
And “Cats” actor Idris Elba, who performs under the name DJ Big Driis, spun tracks along with Diplo at an extremely packed club Basement on Saturday night.

Shooting treated as 'act of terrorism'

Texto completo: The FBI confirmed Sunday it is investigating the deadly shooting at Naval Air Station Pensacola on Friday as an act was terrorism, but assured the community that 100% of all international students are accounted for and are on base.
A number of Saudi students were close to the shooter, identified as Mohammed Alshamrani, a 21-year-old second lieutenant in the Royal Saudi Air Force, said Rachel Rojas, special agent in charge of the FBI Jacksonville Division, at a press conference Sunday.
The shooter killed three people and injured eight others shortly before 7 a.m. Friday when he stormed a classroom building on the base.
Rojas said the Saudi students are continuing to cooperate with authorities, and their Saudi commanding officer has restricted them to the base. She said the Saudi government has pledged to "fully cooperate" with the investigation.
Rojas declined to comment on a motive for the attack, but said that investigating the shooting under the presumption that the act was terrorism allows officials to take advantage of "investigative techniques" that can help them more quickly identify other potential threats.
The FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Forces and the FBI Counterterrorism Division are working to determine if any ideology was a motive in the shooting, Rojas said.
"Our main goal right now is to confirm whether he acted alone or was he a part of a larger network," she said. "We currently assess there was one gunman who perpetrated this attack and no arrests have been made in this case."
The FBI had previously said it was working to confirm whether tweets protesting U.S. intervention in the Middle East came from the shooter. The tweets came just two hours before a 911 call about an active shooter from a profile that looked like an overhead shot of NAS Pensacola.
The author outlined their hatred of the United States for crimes against Muslims, including the detention of suspects at Guantanamo Bay. The account has since been suspended.
The FBI confirmed in a news release Sunday afternoon that investigators have recovered digital evidence that includes a bystander's cellphone videos and multiple videos from base security surveillance.
The cellphone videos were taken by a bystander from outside the building after the attack had started and after first responders had arrived, according to the FBI. The FBI has interviewed that person and is analyzing the videos to determine if any details can further the investigation.
The shooter purchased the weapon used to carry out the shooting, a 9 mm Glock 45, "legally and lawfully" in Florida, but Rojas declined to say when and where it was purchased.
Rojas declined to comment on reports that the shooter had hosted a dinner party prior to the shooting where guests allegedly watched videos of mass shootings.
The Associated Press was the first outlet to report the dinner party and said that one of the three students in attendance later recorded video outside the building where the shooting was taking place.
The New York Times, citing a person briefed on the investigation, instead reported that a video was taken by a student who told investigators he just happened to be in the area during the shooting.
Officials stressed that there is no credible threat to the community, but encouraged anyone with information about the shooter or his activities to contact the FBI at 1-800-CALL-FBI
" ... (W)e encourage you to keep an eye out for each other, especially after a tragedy like this one. If you see something, please say something," she said. "And if you saw something, anything, please provide that information about the shooter that you think that might be relevant in this case. There is absolutely nothing too small. Anything you have, we will take every single tip seriously and we encourage you to come forward."
In all, the FBI has dedicated 80 special agents and task force officers, as well as 100 professional staff from field offices to the investigation, Rojas said. In addition, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, Naval Criminal Investigative Service, Homeland Security Investigations, Florida Department of Law Enforcement, as well as other state and local officials, are helping in the investigation.
As of mid-day Sunday, investigators were focused on conducting additional interviews of witnesses, base personnel, the shooter's friends, classmates and other associates.
"While there are many reports circulating regarding the shooter's motivation, and his alleged activities leading to his attack, I can tell you that we are looking very hard at uncovering his motive. And I would ask for patience so we can get this right," Rojas said.

A Bookstore Whose Vibe Is Pure Narnia

Texto completo: Montclair Book Center is 9,000 square feet of nooks, alcoves, labyrinths and warrens. "It's like a time machine," one customer says.
MONTCLAIR, N.J. -- Montclair Book Center is 35 years old, going on eternity.
A ramshackle throwback to a funkier, more literary time, the store has shelves handmade from raw lumber. And its customers and clerks are often just as eccentric as the shelves.
I've been shopping and snooping there since 1995 and still haven't exhausted all of this biblioscape's labyrinths and warrens -- some of which, I suspect, lead to C.S. Lewis's Narnia or Mervyn Peake's Gormenghast.
Stuffed with hundreds of thousands of best sellers, worst sellers and everything in between, the store is a haven where you can ferret out that certain book (or vinyl record) you don't know you need until you see it. I've stumbled across Italo Calvino limited editions, a hardcover of William Burroughs's "Naked Lunch," and a stash of musty, black-and-white comics magazines from the 1960s and '70s that included Eerie, Creepy and Savage Tales.
The store, which sells both new and used books, is three floors and 9,000 square feet of nooks, alcoves and cul de sacs. Wooden floorboards creak and groan, and the owners have preserved the tin ceilings from the building's decades as a hardware store.
Really, it's an analog heaven. And, essential to me, the place is suffused with the sweet reek of ink, decaying pulp and vintage book dust -- seductive scents that are like pheromones to book lovers.
"Unless you work at a bakery, you don't get many customers talking about how good your store smells," said Pete Ryby, who has worked there since it opened in 1984 and is now the store's primary owner. (Other employees own smaller stakes.)
The pre-World War I building itself is so cockeyed that it looks set to pratfall down the street, as in some silent Buster Keaton two-reeler. It's not hard to imagine Allen Ginsberg holding court out front, chanting from "Howl."
Still, the store is orderly if not antiseptic. Signs are hand-lettered; there are plenty of chairs for contemplation and ladders for climbing; and, whether by accident or puckish design, the crime section stops short at a fittingly dead end.
John D. Ynsua, a co-manager and owner, says the store has hundreds of regulars, including many "who come from far away." But some are more memorable than others. There's the customer, for example, who anchors himself at the checkout and mutters in what sounds like heavy-metal vomit vocals. On one visit, he'll ask for the Christian Bible; on others, the Satanic Bible.
More often, customers are like Fabrice Nozier, a senior at Drew University in Madison, N.J. "I like the feel of this place," he said as he sat on the floor and pored over filmmaking volumes. "It's like a time machine, coming here."
Holding up a copy of "Guide to Filmmaking," a 1969 Signet paperback by Edward Pincus, Mr. Nozier added, "I wouldn't find a book like this at Barnes & Noble."
When I tell people about Montclair Book Center, I almost always mention Ynsua, a friendly 56-year-old filigreed with tattoos and earrings who started there in 1999 and who embodies its eclectic vibe. He owns five kilts and hundreds of vintage T-shirts -- Count Chocula, the Emma Peel and John Steed "Avengers" -- and his passions as a bibliophile include comics, science fiction and pre-Renaissance European history. He's also the store's resident carpenter and a talented cartoonist who once studied at Joe Kubert's cartooning school in Dover, N.J.
"I've tried not to work for corporations," Ynsua said. "I like bosses who own their businesses. I like jobs where I can improvise."
There's plenty of that at the Book Center. Indeed, improvisation has helped the store stay in business. Since it started selling used vinyl in 2014, for example, the records "have brought in a lot of new customers and increased foot traffic," said the co-owner Maureen Disimile, who manages the music side of the business and was dressed in a black Bruce Springsteen T-shirt.
A quick look at the records revealed a healthy infestation of Beatles; "Together," by Marvin Gaye and Mary Wells; the musical "Hair," in the "version originale française"; and even the 1960s British blues rockers Blodwyn Pig. There was also a strong dose of 45s.
Still, the store comes down to what employees call "book people." "I like being around literature, art and music, and the people who like that stuff," said Ynsua, who doesn't own a computer or subscribe to cable TV. "My brain isn't calcifying here."
Lucas McGuffie, a clerk since 2014, added: "The attraction is the books, and the book people. They aren't stupid. They're more open-minded. They're smart enough to know that they don't know all there is to know."
Disimile said: "Montclair is a cool town to have a bookstore in because of all the different kinds of people who live here." The city of some 39,000 has an art museum and annual jazz and film festivals, and supports another fine indie bookstore, Watchung Booksellers.
Ryby acknowledges that having the business in Montclair has been significant in weathering the bedlam of the book business: "Not many downtowns around could support our kind of store," he said. "We're a throwback, in this day and age. If you're going to sell something, you're lucky it's books."

What Not to Do on Your Work Computer

Texto completo: It's best to assume your work computer is monitored and act accordingly. Here are some less obvious tasks you should be mindful of.
If you use a work-issued laptop or desktop computer, you've likely been tempted to check your personal email, store private files on the company's Google Drive, or avoid work entirely by diving into a research rabbit hole that has absolutely nothing to do with your job. You probably shouldn't do any of this on a computer provided by your employer.
Employers can install software to monitor what you do on your work-issued laptop or desktop. In the most watchful of workplaces, this may include keyloggers that can see everything you type or screenshot tools that track your productivity. What type of surveillance and security software is installed on your company computer is often based on two factors: how large the company is (and what resources it has to dedicate to this) and what type of information you deal with in your role. If you work with sensitive materials, such as health records, financial data, or government contracts, you can count on your employer keeping a careful eye on what you do.
For most of us, the fear of being heavily surveilled at work is unwarranted. Jesse Krembs, senior information security analyst at The New York Times, said, "Without supporting evidence, at scale this is pretty rare. It tends to generate a lot of useless data, rope the employer into liability issues, and generally make the team that monitors these surveillance systems miserable. That being said, almost all large companies have a targeted program for doing this, especially for dealing with suspected insider threat or fraud."
Even if your every move isn't being watched, it's still best to assume your work computer is monitored and act accordingly. Here are some less obvious tasks you should be mindful of.
Don't store personal files on your work-issued laptop or phone
Every security expert I spoke with mentioned one no-no: storing personal files on an employer-issued phone or computer. If you're fired, your laptop is usually the first thing it'll take from you, and if your company ends up in a lawsuit, any files on your laptop or desktop are fair game. Tracy Maleeff, an information security analyst at The New York Times, pointed to security concerns as well: "From the employer's perspective, it just adds to the threat model of potential infected documents."
Isaac Blum, director of applications and system services at logistics real estate company Prologis, added that even if you feel like you have job security, you might not have data security, depending on the security tools your company uses. "Some of these tools, if they detect a breach, they'll start wiping files," Mr. Blum said. If your computer gets infected with malware, the security measures taken to try to get rid of problems might clear out your personal files, too.
Don't use Google Docs, Slack, or similar tools for anything you don't want your employer to see
Since it's online and not software installed on our computers, it's easy to think of G Suite, which includes services like Gmail, Google Docs, and Sheets, as private productivity software. But the Freedom of the Press Foundation notes several reasons you shouldn't use a company-issued Google account to store your private data.
Administrative users with G Suite Enterprise can search for specific phrases in an employee's emails and documents, just like you can in your own account. Employers can set up audits to be notified of suspicious behavior and create custom scripts for retaining data.
For example, an employer could establish a process by which your email drafts are saved even if they're never sent. If you've ever considered drafting a resignation email calling your boss a jerk, do so elsewhere.
As for non-Gmail employee email accounts, you can safely assume they're being monitored too. Mr. Blum said, "We can see people's emails. There's only a select few people, but nothing is technically not viewable." Due to the risk of sharing insider information, the number of individuals who have access to employee emails is usually small.
The same goes for chat software, including Slack. Admins have access to private messages, and Slack saves messages on its servers.
You should avoid signing in to other personal messaging apps, like Apple Messages or Google Hangouts. Not only would your employer potentially have access to those messages, but you also make yourself susceptible to embarrassing moments, like receiving a private message when you're screen sharing. If you want to trash-talk your co-workers or your company, do it over a third-party app (like Signal) on your personal phone.
Assume your internet traffic is monitored
Your employer almost certainly monitors your internet traffic. But beyond watching out for the obvious stuff, this probably isn't as nefarious as you think. Blum said it'd be aware of "basic web traffic" only. Though, if you're routinely not getting your work done, don't be surprised if a boss rolls out data on how much time you spend scrolling Facebook.
If you think you can use a VPN to hide what you do, think again. "We deploy endpoint protection," Mr. Blum said. "Even in the event you install a local VPN on a laptop, we can still see the DNS traffic. We have an agent so when it connects back up, it'll shoot over whatever history was there. But while you're connected to the VPN, it'll still be anonymized by the VPN you're using."

Even if your employer doesn't care much about your browsing habits, it's still best to avoid doing any personal business -- like side hustles or hobbies -- on your work computer. But you don't have to be paranoid about everything. "You can pay all your bills," Mr. Blum noted.
"That's not the kind of thing people should be concerned with." Joanna Grama, senior consultant at Vantage Technology Consulting Group, suggested, "Use your smartphone when you want to access your personal social media."
Be more careful with your computer when you're in public
You should treat your work computer with the same care as you would your personal computer. That means being secure on public Wi-Fi and using common sense. Ms. Maleeff suggested using a VPN for public Wi-Fi (Wirecutter recommends using TunnelBear).
Ms. Maleeff also suggested locking your computer when you step away from it. "I have a great story of a U.S. government employee traveling next to me on Amtrak who left his laptop open and unlocked while he left his seat," she said. "Without even touching the computer, I was able to determine a lot of information." If you're at a coffee shop, on an airplane or train, or anywhere else in public, log out or shut your laptop.
How to see what's running on your computer
When you use employer-owned equipment, it's good to remember you don't have a right to privacy -- but that doesn't mean your employer shouldn't also clearly state what kind of monitoring it does and how.
Ms. Grama noted that your employee handbook is a good place to look to find out what software may be running on your computer. "Probably anybody who works in H.R. will say that yes, this type of information must be in an employee handbook," she said. "It's a really good practice and would engender good feeling about your employer if you knew that type of monitoring was taking place."
If your handbook doesn't have details but you're still curious about which monitoring software your computer has, the information is usually easy to find. Mr. Blum said that such software "may not launch on a task bar, but many are still located in add/remove programs. On a Mac, they'll show as an application or service." A quick Google search should reveal the software's capabilities. As weird as it can feel to have your employer monitor you, everyone I spoke with recommended against deleting the software, which will call attention to you.
Most employers include screen-sharing software, like VNC or TeamViewer, which gives your I.T. department access to your computer remotely. If you've ever been freaked out because an I.T. worker "took control" of your mouse to fix your computer, this is what they used. It's usually obvious when this software is running, so don't fret about your I.T. department watching you mistype emails all day long.
The central tenet of this advice is to avoid saying or doing anything on a work-issued computer or account that you don't want your employer to see. It's probably fine to pay a bill now and again -- or to create a lineup for your office's fantasy football league -- but avoid doing anything personal or unprofessional.

Texto completo: The president had pardoned Army First Lt. Clint Lorance and Maj. Mathew Golsteyn last month, in a move that strained his relationship with Pentagon leaders.
President Trump brought two soldiers he had pardoned in cases involving war crimes onstage at a fund-raiser this weekend in Florida, tightening his embrace of an episode that roiled his relationship with military leaders and prompted a public outcry.
Mr. Trump, as the featured speaker, invited up Army First Lt. Clint Lorance and Maj. Mathew L. Golsteyn, according to a report in The Miami Herald that was confirmed by a person with knowledge of the event.
The fund-raiser, which was held Saturday at the J.W. Marriott Turnberry Resort and Spa in Aventura and benefited the Republican Party of Florida, was closed to reporters. A Republican official, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the event, said that the officers were guests of an attendee and that they had not been part of the program. Mr. Trump appears to have called them up upon learning they were there.
Major Golsteyn was awaiting trial at the time of his pardon, charged with a single count of premeditated murder for the 2010 killing of a Taliban bomb-making suspect. He had admitted he killed the man in interviews with reporters, but said it was justified because he believed the man was returning to the Taliban after being released from questioning.
Lieutenant Lorance was serving a 19-year sentence for directing soldiers in his command to shoot unarmed villagers, killing two men, in 2012.
Mr. Trump pardoned Major Golsteyn and Lieutenant Lorance last month, causing tension with top brass at the Pentagon over the message that such a move sent to troops about the importance of following laws governing military conduct. Mr. Trump also intervened to restore the rank of Edward Gallagher, a member of the Navy SEALs who had been charged with and acquitted of crimes related to his service in Afghanistan, a move that led to the ouster of the Navy secretary.
Officials at the White House and the Republican Party of Florida did not respond to requests for comment.
Still, the move by the president did not come out of nowhere. Despite pleas from advisers that he not intervene in the men's cases, Mr. Trump has remained adamant in private discussions with advisers that the men are "warriors" who were being denied the tools they needed to fight, according to three people close to Mr. Trump.
Mr. Trump is also said to have suggested to aides that he would like to campaign with the three men. Advisers privately said they thought he was being provocative and did not intend to carry through with the suggestion.
But he has already used the men as a talking point in his political rallies, arguing in Florida last month that he had "stuck up for three great warriors against the deep state."

The weak case for impeachment and why it might backfire

Texto completo: It was Gerald R. Ford who said, “an impeachable offense is whatever a majority of the House of Representatives considers it to be at a given moment in history.”
Ford said that in 1970, and he wasn’t talking about President Richard Nixon. He was proposing the impeachment of a Supreme Court justice.
Then-Congressman Ford, the House Republican leader, “touched off an angry floor debate,” according to a New York Times report, “by suggesting that Justice William O. Douglas might have had ties with gambling and underworld figures.” Ford said the 71-year-old justice was “unfit and should be removed.” He accused Douglas of espousing “hippie-yippie style revolution” in his writings.
The House Judiciary Committee investigated for six months, but there never was a trial in the Senate. Justice Douglas served on the Court until his retirement in 1975. Then it was Gerald R. Ford who appointed his successor, having become president in 1974 when Nixon resigned under threat of impeachment.
Although it may seem that impeachment is a rare occurrence, the subject comes up often in American political history.
“The Framers foresaw that impeachment might be subject to superheated partisanship,” wrote Harvard Law School professor Raoul Berger in his 1973 book, “Impeachment: The Constitutional Problems.” Berger noted that the impeachment of President Harry Truman was suggested during the Korean War, there were repeated demands for Nixon’s impeachment over the war in Vietnam and John F. Kennedy believed that “if he had not moved to expel Soviet nuclear missiles from Cuba at the time of the confrontation with Khrushchev, he ‘would have been impeached.’”
Dive into the scholarly research or take Jerry Ford’s word for it: An impeachable offense is whatever the House says it is, and conviction is whatever two-thirds of the Senate “considers to be sufficiently serious to require removal of the accused from office.”
The House of Representatives can impeach President Donald Trump, even if he didn’t commit any crime. Impeachment trials are nothing like criminal trials. After an impeachment trial, the prosecutors and the jury have to stand trial themselves—in their next election.
One-third of the United States Senate and every member of the House of Representatives will be on the ballot in November 2020, unless they’ve chosen not to run for re-election or somebody knocks them out in a primary.
Impeachment is politically risky, yet House Democrats are pursuing it at the frantic pace of a Keystone Kops chase. The Intelligence Committee’s 300-page impeachment report is a rush job that draws heavily on the opinions and impressions of bureaucratic specialists who clearly are appalled that the president isn’t relying on their advice.
This type of conflict between bureaucratic experts and elected leaders isn’t new. In the early 1980s, President Ronald Reagan sent a handwritten letter to Soviet General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev, which is on display at the Reagan Library. A sign next to the letter reads, “Despite the State Department’s many attempts to change it, the President finally demanded that his own personal draft be sent to Brezhnev accompanied by the State Department’s thoughts in a separate document.”
Imagine the news headlines that House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff’s leaky crew could have made from that.
They certainly puffed up the importance of government workers who were never elected by anybody. “NSC staff had prepared a standard package of talking points for the President based on official U.S. policy,” the Intelligence Committee report states in a section titled, “The President’s Misconduct.” The talking points “included recommendations to encourage President Zelensky to continue to promote anti-corruption reforms in Ukraine,” which was “a pillar of American foreign policy in the country” going all the way back to “the 1990s” but — cue the dramatic music — “this call would deviate significantly from that script.”
Of course, the president has a perfect right to deviate from the staff’s script and to make changes in the policy, but House Democrats, most of them, contend that Trump was motivated by the desire for personal political advantage.
Here’s what Trump said to the president of Ukraine: “I would like you to do us a favor, though, because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike … I would like to have the attorney general call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it. As you saw yesterday, that whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an incompetent performance, but they say a lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can do, it’s very important that you do it if that’s possible.”
And also, “I would like [Rudy Giuliani] to call you. I will ask him to call you along with the attorney general. Rudy very much knows what’s happening and he is a very capable guy. If you could speak to him that would be great.”
And also, “The other thing, there’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great.”
In all three of those excerpts, Trump is asking Zelensky to work with the attorney general of the United States, William Barr. The AG is heading up an investigation into the suspicious origins of the Trump-Russia story that was used to justify a secret counter-intelligence investigation, then a secret warrant to spy on an American who was an adviser to the Trump campaign and then a two-year investigation by a special prosecutor that ultimately found nothing that linked Trump to Russia.
Barr’s investigation follows a narrower investigation by Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz. The IG has jurisdiction to investigate current employees of the government, but lacks wider authority. Still, Horowitz’s report is expected to shed light on the actions of FBI employees and others who made questionable decisions to investigate Trump during the 2016 campaign.
The report is set for release on Monday, Dec. 9.
Is it possible that the Democrats’ noisy rush to impeachment is a massive misdirection to neutralize the damage from coming reports about the actions of officials during the Obama administration?
We’ll see. Meanwhile, the signs of political damage are beginning to appear.
On Thursday evening, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi held a one-hour televised town-hall meeting on CNN. Thirty-four minutes in, she was pleading with the audience, “Could we not have any more questions about impeachment?”
By November, that may be the Democrats’ campaign slogan.

Texto completo: TEMPE, Ariz. - Xephos is not the author of “Dog Is Love: Why and How Your Dog Loves You,” one of the latest books to plumb the nature of dogs, but she helped inspire it. And as I scratched behind her ears, it was easy to see why.
First, she fixed on me with imploring doggy eyes, asking for my attention. Then, every time I stopped scratching she nudged her nose under my hand and flipped it up. I speak a little dog, but the message would have been clear even if I didn’t: Don’t stop.
We were in the home office of Clive Wynne, a psychologist at Arizona State University who specializes in dog behavior. He belongs to Xephos, a mixed breed that the Wynne family found in a shelter in 2012.
Wynne’s book is an extended argument about what makes dogs special - not how smart they are, but how friendly they are. Xephos’ shameless and undiscriminating affection affected both his heart and his thinking.
As Xephos nose-nudged me again, Wynne was describing genetic changes that occurred at some point in dog evolution that he says explain why dogs are so sociable with members of other species.
“Hey,” Wynne said to her as she tilted her head to get the maximum payoff from my efforts, “how long have you had these genes?”
No one disputes the sociability of dogs. But Wynne doesn’t agree with the scientific point of view that dogs have a unique ability to understand and communicate with humans. He thinks they have a unique capacity for interspecies love, a word that he has decided to use, throwing aside decades of immersion in scientific jargon.
Dog books abound
“Dog Is Love” is one of several new books on dogs out this year, and one of a flood of such books over the last decade or so. Brian Hare, an evolutionary anthropologist and researcher of dog behavior at Duke University, who founded the Duke Canine Cognition Center, recently wrote that there are 70,000 dog books listed on Amazon.
Since 2000, around the time dog research had a resurgence, a small but significant number of those books are written by scientists for a general audience. Like Hare’s “The Genius of Dogs,” published in 2013, the books address what is going on in a dog’s heart and mind. Most emphasize the mind.
Wynne’s book runs counter to Hare’s when it comes to the importance of dogs’ thinking ability, which Hare sees as central to their bond with humans. By using the L-word, Wynne may well appeal to the many besotted dog owners. But he may also disappoint. The reason dogs are such “an amazing success story” is because of their ability to bond with other species, he said. Not just humans.
Raise a dog with sheep and it will love sheep. Raise a dog with goats and it will love goats. Raise a dog with people ... you know the rest.
Some now-extinct wolves attached themselves to humans 15,000 years ago or longer because we had good leftovers, or so the dominant theory goes, although what actually happened is lost to time. Apparently, humans liked the renegade wolves quite a bit and eventually started controlling their breeding and letting them sleep on down coverlets.
Now, as Wynne said in a talk at the International Canine Science conference in Phoenix in October, dogs are an astonishing evolutionary success. Wolves, not so much. “For every one surviving wolf on this planet, there are at least 3,000 dogs.” On the other hand, nobody puts a silly Halloween costume on a wolf.
In the early 2000s, when Wynne began research on dogs, one of his experiments was a follow-up on the work of Hare, who had concluded that dogs were better than wolves or other animals at following human directions. In particular, dogs followed human pointing better than other animals. Wynne and Monique Udell, an animal behaviorist at Oregon State University, expected to confirm Hare’s findings.
The wolves they chose to work with were hand-raised and socialized at Wolf Park in Lafayette, Indiana. Wynne said he found the wolves were as good at following human pointing as the best pet dogs.
Hare and his colleagues responded by questioning whether the experiments were really comparable, maintaining that dogs have an innate ability to follow human pointing without the special attention the wolves were given. The debate continues.
The second part of Wynne’s argument has to do with how social dogs are. There is no question that they bond with people in a way that other canines do not. Wynne recounted an experiment showing that as long as puppies spend 90 minutes a day, for one week, with a human any time before they are 14 weeks old, they will become socialized and comfortable with humans.
Interestingly, the experiment found no genetic absolutism about the connection between dogs and humans. Without contact with humans when they are young, dogs can become as wary of humans as wild animals. Wolves are not so easily socialized. They require 24-hour-a-day involvement with humans for many weeks when they are puppies to become more tolerant of human beings. They never turn into Xephos.
What brain scans show
The evidence of dog affection for humans goes beyond the observable actions of Xephos and those like her. Gregory Berns, a neuroeconomist at Emory University, who himself was drawn into animal study by wanting to understand what his own dog, Callie, was thinking, used MRI machines to watch what was going on in their brains.
Among his findings is that the part of dogs’ brains that light up when they hear their owners’ voices is the same part of the human brain that lights up when we are fond of someone or something. His first book was “How Dogs Love Us.”
Alexandra Horowitz, head of the Dog Cognition Lab at Barnard College in New York, and a prolific writer on dogs, also addressed the question of love briefly in her new book, “Our Dogs, Ourselves.”
Without doubt, dogs have feelings, she wrote, but she cautioned that just as certainly, those feelings were not the same as human feelings. Nor, she argued, should we assume that dogs are in between robot and homo sapiens on an emotional spectrum. She wrote in her book, “For all we know, dogs’ emotional experience is far more elaborate than ours.”
Central to that experience, although unknown in its complexity, is the pleasure a dog experiences in the presence of humans. The intensity of that pleasure and the ease of triggering it, Wynne said, is built into the dog genome.
He found this in his research with Bridgett vonHoldt, a molecular biologist at Princeton University. She and a team of researchers identified genes in dogs that in humans are associated with Williams-Beuren syndrome, a rare genetic disorder. One of the many symptoms of the syndrome is indiscriminate friendliness. Wynne and Udell worked with vonHoldt on a subsequent study of wolves and dogs that tied behavior and genetics together. They concluded that the genes associated with Williams-Beuren syndrome in humans underlie the friendliness of dogs compared to wolves.
Humans, they suggested, may have selected friendly dogs over thousands of years of domestication, and the Williams-Beuren genes may be one of the results. Other scientists have been cautious about the results, seeing the work as presenting an intriguing hypothesis that requires more research.
Whether these are the genes involved, humans appear to have molded dogs to be friendly to other species beyond humans. Apparently, puppies introduced to any other species when they are young enough form a strong bond with that species.
Dogs have “an abnormal willingness to form strong emotional bonds with almost anything that crosses their path,” Wynne said. “And they maintain this throughout life. Above and beyond that they have a willingness and an interest to interact with strangers.”
How and when this free love, or hypersociality, evolved in dogs is up for debate. Wynne is betting that after some ancient wolves began to associate with humans 15,000 or more years ago and became dogs, and humans began to live in settlements and farming took off about 8,000 years ago, humans began to breed dogs for friendliness, causing the genetic differences that vonHoldt found. With luck, future research on modern and ancient dog DNA will show if he is right.
For now, we humans can at least enjoy the amiability of dogs. Looking at Xephos as we wrapped up our conversation, he said, “It’s not strange that she wants to interact with me. What’s strange is that she wants to be friends with you. Right?”
Well, I don’t know about that. I’m a pretty good ear scratcher. “Right, Xephos?”

Texto completo: Dr. Jen Gunter has two New York Times columns dedicated to women's health, a Canadian docuseries called "Jensplaining" and a very active social media presence where she disseminates medical fallacies in a way that the general public can understand. Her latest project is the book "The Vagina Bible: The Vulva and the Vagina: Separating the Myth from the Medicine" (Citadel, $18.95) - a Publishers Weekly and New York Times bestseller.
Born and raised in Winnipeg, Canada, the obstetrician and gynecologist resides with her sons in Northern California. An edited version of our conversation follows.

Q: You're famous for all the information you share about women's health, but let's be real. Your shoe collection is famous too. Where do you buy them?
A: (Laughs) Oh yeah, I have a thing for shoes. I wear a lot of Fluevogs. These are the shoes I purchase the most because they're so comfortable. I have a huge shoe cabinet in my bedroom where I display my most beautiful shoes like artwork. I grew up with size 10 1/2 feet and no stores carried bigger than a 10. My whole life I wore shoes that were too small and painful or just really ugly, so I think that's why shoes are such a thing for me.

Q: You do a lot of writing that you share with the public. Do you write when you're on the road?
A: I actually do. I don't use public Wi-Fi ever, especially in places like airports. So I write a lot on planes and at airports, because I won't be distracted by being online. I can usually sit somewhere and tune everything out. I recently flew to Chicago and worked three hours solid on the way there and back. Writing makes the trip go faster.

Q: What was the first trip you took as a child?
A: My parents emigrated from England and we went back there every few years. The first trip I remember would've been around kindergarten time. It was such a big deal to fly in the early '70s. You dressed up and had to behave. The flight attendants gave you things like wings and little books for kids to fill out.

Q: Given the choice, would you eat at a street cart or fine restaurant?
A: There are people who have street carts who are making amazing food, but I like the experience of going in and sitting down to a great meal and I want my kids to have that experience. I cook at home mostly and we only go out to eat every four or five months, but when we do, it's to a really nice place like a Michelin-starred restaurant as a treat.

Q: Where are your favorite weekend getaways?
A: We don't really go away for the weekends. My kids do, because they'll do that with their dad. But when they travel with me, it's usually on longer trips to see family in Canada or England. But once we get there, we will take overnight trips to another city. It's so much fun as a tourist to take the train.

Q: What would be your dream trip?
A: I'm desperate to go to Greece. I grew up obsessed with Greek mythology. I want to see the Parthenon and Acropolis and all the things I had read about. I also love Greek food!

Q: What are some of your favorite cities?
A: I love Cardiff in Wales. Welsh people are so awesome, but I'm kind of biased because my dad's family is originally from Wales. It's cool to have a castle right in the city that you can walk right up to. It's not crowded or crazy. They have a beautiful art museum in Cardiff and you walk in and there's no crowd.
I also like New York. When I took my kids the first time, they were unprepared for the volume of people on the street. They were a little freaked out. They'd been to Toronto and London, but London's not as dense as New York. It's a big city, but everybody's so nice and the food is great.

Texto completo: One of art's great privileges and responsibilities is to imagine lives that may not be written about in our textbooks.
"History is almost always written by the victors," Jawaharlal Nehru famously wrote, and like most highly reductive, irresistibly catchy phrases, it's not completely wrong. Of course, considering the arc of human existence as a series of scrimmages won or lost is problematic in a number of ways, chief among them the implication that life itself is something that can be measured quantifiably. Yet for centuries, we have been taught that there was a single, unified narrative: To the victor went the spoils, and the spoils were stories, annals of their feats and adventures.
One of the shared missions of recent decades of scholarship, art and activism has been the complicating of the historical record, something realized not only in its correction, but in its expansion. It isn't just that the historical chronicle needs to be revised; it's that we need to understand that there isn't simply a chronicle -- that history is the sum total of both the ur-text and the footnotes (and that some footnotes should be texts of their own). Some of this work has been done by journalists; my own colleagues at The New York Times have used reportage to enrich our understanding of history with projects such as Overlooked, which gives long-overdue obituaries to women whose accomplishments the paper chose not to recognize in their lifetime. It's a reminder that history doesn't belong to any single group of people, and nor is it static; it is a palimpsest, and all of us its authors.
Artists, too, are increasingly revisiting and limning history, giving voice to lives that always existed but were rarely heard. In his story "The Revisionists," Jesse Green, the Times' co-chief theater critic, surveys the work of a group of multidisciplinary queer artists who are either placing gay and trans people into a history that excludes or refuses to acknowledge them or are ferreting out those hidden biographies and yanking them into the spotlight. The results are, often, thrilling, as well as deeply moving: Some of the works are more clearly fantastical than others, but all of them should and do make the viewer or reader wonder what it says about us if we're so shocked at the idea of gay lives existing where we've been told they never did. As Green says of Larry Kramer's two-volume "The American People," which depicts an America founded almost exclusively by gay men (including, in Kramer's version, Washington, Hamilton and Lincoln), "to imagine that everything Kramer argues is mad is to make an even madder argument: That no one of such consequence as these men could ever be gay."
Why do we accept some people and some lives and not others? It's because at some point we heard about them or read about them. Seeing the fact of them recorded, presented for us all to look at, makes them real. One of art's great privileges and responsibilities is to imagine lives that may not be written about in our textbooks. Any of us who's not yet seen ourselves reflected in art knows that that doesn't mean we don't exist -- it only means that we've yet to write (or paint, or photograph, or sing) ourselves into the canon. So maybe it's not a revision after all. Maybe it's actually a reckoning.

Texto completo: There is no denying that Paris-based journalist Elaine Sciolino is a badass. As part of her encyclopedic research for her new book, 'The Seine: The River That Made Paris,' the former Paris bureau chief for the New York Times, 70, stripped down to her undies and jumped into the Seine about 125 miles southeast of Paris on a July day. The water was less than 60 degrees.
You could call it immersive journalism. Because, let's face it, there's nothing like an American in Paris to truly enthuse over every aspect of France, its beautiful Seine and all things French, no matter how frigid.
Sciolino achieved that level of enthusiasm (if not immersion) in her 2016 'The Only Street in Paris: Life on the Rue des Martyrs.' Now the writer, who was also a foreign correspondent for Newsweek, has written an extended love letter to the Seine, from its ancient underground source in a 'forgotten corner of Burgundy' to its drab discharge into the English Channel at Le Havre.

In too many spots, though, 'The Seine' reads slightly more like an almanac than a love letter. With this sweeping level of research, the reader has the sense that no tidbit is excluded: The river is 483 miles long; it's an estuary river (like the Hudson) that rises and falls with the tides; and on and on. In fact, it's clear that this book is meant not to be read straight through but to be sampled bit by bit, like the delicate macarons that line the shelves of so many patisseries.
With that attitude in mind, it's fun to select the morsels, from those that will undoubtedly impress and disgust dinner companions to those that might come in handy in a trivia contest. For instance, in the 18th century, the Seine running through Paris was so polluted, it took on the color of whatever was dumped into it: animal carcasses, sewage, tanner's dyes. Poor people had no choice but to use it for drinking water, which probably contributed to the cholera epidemic of 1832.
Here's another good one: The death mask made from 'L'Inconnue,' a mysterious and innocent teenager who apparently drowned in the Seine in the late 19th century, became a model for Resusci Anne, the lifelike mannequin upon whom many of us learned CPR.
And Francophiles like me might find themselves collecting ideas for new places to visit: the chateau at Vaux-le-Vicomte; the Musee Carnavalet in Paris; Ile Saint-Louis for Berthillon ice cream; La Maison Fournaise, where Renoir painted 'Luncheon of the Boating Party'; Rouen's Musée des Beaux-Arts.
Sciolino reaches the right elegiac note in her afterword. Although the book was mostly finished before the devastating April fire at Notre Dame, she added a final section that allowed her to conclude this homage to her adopted river, city and country. We learn that without hoses on fire brigade boats drawing from the abundant waters of the Seine, the fire on the Ile-de-France might have been even worse for the cathedral at the heart of French life.
'In the Middle Ages,' she writes, 'the Seine contributed to the creation of Notre-Dame. Barges on the river and oxcarts on land brought thousands of tons of stone and other construction materials from faraway places in France to the building site. On the night of the great fire, the river was the cathedral's salvation.' Sequana, the ancient goddess who gave the Seine its name, 'saved the greatest cathedral in the world.'
At the same time, the book falls short in places. An entire chapter on the photography of the Seine offers up just one photo. Granted, it's a good one, of writer Emile Zola with his camera on the banks of the river, but Sciolino is reduced to writing descriptions of all of the other photographs. In a later chapter she describes an iconic photo of Hitler at Trocadero in front of the Eiffel Tower in 1940, after France surrendered to Germany. 'Hitler and his aides are center stage, rendered in stark black and white, the background of Paris in pale shades of gray.' I wish she had been able to offer it as well.
And this love letter sometimes comes closer to the tone of a guidebook. She writes: 'We crowded at the front of the deck and snapped the postcard-perfect image. 'I've never seen anything so beautiful,' said Joanna, a retired schoolteacher from South Carolina.'
Here she describes La Seine Musicale, an arts center that opened in 2017 on an island in the Seine seven miles southwest of Paris: 'It is the go-to place to experience some of the best global music and dance, to dine, shop, have a drink, walk through the gardens, and take in the view from the roof.'
The romantic allure of the Seine will do that to people. But there are worse things than being seduced by a river, even if it sometimes leads to a couple of weak-kneed sighs. As the French would say, 'Ça vaut la peine' " it's worth it.

Texto completo: On a recent Saturday, producer Todd Lieberman trekked to the Rose Bowl to witness a marketing stunt for his new movie, "The Aeronauts," starring Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones as 19th century hot air balloonists.
Amazon Studios, the distributor of the estimated $40-million period drama, had set up an old-timey carnival replicating the fair depicted in the movie, with a juggler, a tightrope walker and a hot air balloon that took guests 60 feet in the air. After sunset, guests watched the film on a giant screen attached to the side of another balloon equipped with a wrap-around screen.
During a two-day late-November stint in Pasadena, thousands of people attended the carnival, which Amazon is taking to multiple cities as a touring show before returning to Los Angeles later this month to coincide with its streaming release. Lieberman said he was wowed.

"The whole experience of it made the film feel like a massive event," Lieberman said.
Amazon is hoping audiences agree this weekend, when the film plays in select theaters shortly before it becomes available for streaming on Amazon Prime Video.
Building audience interest has been a challenge for the period drama, which tells the story of a scientist (Redmayne) and a balloon pilot (Jones) who attempt to soar higher than anyone before them. The roll-out hit a setback earlier this year when the studio backtracked on its plan to wage a full-fledged theatrical release for the London-set feature.
Amazon had planned to give the movie a high-profile fall release, starting with a week exclusively in Imax auditoriums to take advantage of the movie's aerial visuals.
But those plans were scrapped this summer when Amazon decided instead to put the film in theaters Dec. 6, followed by its streaming release Dec. 20.
The move represented a surprising shift for Amazon, which theater owners had seen as an ally. Unlike its disruptive competitor Netflix, Amazon typically released films in theaters nearly three months before bringing them to streaming viewers.
With its brief two-week window, "The Aeronauts" is playing in only about 100 theaters this weekend, including Los Angeles arthouse locations The Landmark and Laemmle's Playhouse. But Matt Newman, cohead of Amazon's film division, said he's satisfied with the theatrical footprint.
"To me, the most important thing was ensuring our customers have that choice to watch it in theaters or to watch it on Amazon Prime Video," Newman said. "It makes me pretty excited that we're giving customers a chance to watch it in theaters if they want to."
Analysts and executives say the plan supports the company's larger strategy to better serve customers by bringing some movies to Prime Video viewers more quickly. Meanwhile, the company is facing an onslaught of competition in the streaming wars from rivals including Netflix, Disney+, Apple TV+ and the upcoming HBO Max.
As it fights for viewers amid an unprecedented wave of new streaming movies and shows, Amazon is hoping its marketing ploys will grab attention for its films.
The idea to re-create the 1862 fair from "The Aeronauts" came during a fall brainstorming meeting at the Amazon Studios' Culver City headquarters. During the meeting, an employee floated the idea of showing the movie on the side of a hot air balloon. Newman initially thought it sounded like a "pretty crazy idea." They went ahead with it anyway and attached a giant, flexible LED screen to the side of the floating vessel.
The company has taken its touring show to San Francisco and Phoenix, and it will also hit Atlanta, Orlando and Austin, Texas. The initiative will then have a three-day stop at the Grove in Los Angeles starting Dec. 20. The Rose Bowl event drew more than 5,000 attendees over two days and employed a staff of 100, including an aerial acrobat and a fortune teller.
"Aeronauts" isn't the only Amazon film this season to get a short theatrical window. The political thriller "The Report," starring Adam Driver, opened in theaters Nov. 15 for a limited run. Mirroring Netflix, Amazon has not released box office tallies for the film and won't for "The Aeronauts" either.
To tout "The Report" debut last week, the company bought front-page ads in newspapers, including the Los Angeles Times, New York Times, USA Today and Wall Street Journal. The ads resembled the front page of each publication, with headlines and stories redacted with black lines.
The campaign for "The Report," which the company sees as an awards hopeful, was successful, according to Amazon executives. Newman said the movie had the biggest first-weekend viewership of any film on Amazon Prime Video, though he couldn't specify how many people watched; Amazon does not release viewership numbers.
"We're doing something new," Newman said. "Knowing we have a two-week theatrical window, we wanted to make sure we went above and beyond to allow these movies to create noise and become a cultural moment."
Such marketing tactics are becoming more common for studios. On the TV side, Amazon got attention during its Emmys push for "The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel," when the company partnered with Los Angeles-area businesses to offer 1950s-inspired prices on goods and services, including $40 hotel rooms, 30-cent malts and $2.50 makeovers.
Other companies have been experimenting with unusual marketing ploys.
For "The Irishman," which was briefly in theaters before its Nov. 27 streaming release, Netflix gave New York's Little Italy a 1975 makeover, hiring actors to dress up and interact with passersby as if it were the day after the disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa. The company printed fake newspapers and offered food specials at local restaurants.
Earlier this year, Universal Pictures offered blowouts for dogs at Drybar locations to advertise "The Secret Life of Pets 2."
Such initiatives aren't cheap. People familiar with the matter say the campaigns for Amazon's recent movies cost close to what the company spends on a traditional domestic release, which industry sources estimate at about $20 million. But analysts say the spending is necessary for companies like Amazon that are trying to compete during awards season.
"I think it's a smarter way of using your media buy," said Jim Amos, former studio executive and founder of entertainment consultancy Scout53. "This is a lot more targeted."
The campaign for "The Aeronauts" comes amid broader questions about Amazon's larger film strategy. The decision to give the movie a truncated release prompted wide speculation that the company had lost confidence in its box-office prospects.
For movies including "Manchester By the Sea" and "The Big Sick," Amazon pursued the more standard film release pattern, betting that it set it apart from Netflix and helped attract filmmakers who want their movies seen on the big screen in thousands of theaters.
But recently, its movies, including the Mindy Kaling-Emma Thompson dramedy "Late Night" and the Jillian Bell film "Brittany Runs a Marathon," have struggled in theaters. "Late Night" and "Brittany Runs a Marathon" grossed $15.5 million and $7 million, respectively, in North America.
Amazon executives have insisted that the about-face for "The Aeronauts" was not related to the struggles of its recent films, nor is it a sign that Amazon is abandoning theaters altogether. Rather, the company is determining its distribution plans on a case-by-case basis to best serve its Prime customers, executives say.
For example, "Honey Boy," Shia LaBeouf's dark semi-autobiographical drama, is getting a release typical of arthouse pictures, debuting in four theaters Nov. 8 before expanding to 186 last weekend.
"We wanted to make sure the movie found the widest audience possible," Newman said of "The Aeronauts." "I think we're going to be very happy with that decision."
Lieberman said he's pleased with the roll-out, despite the limited theatrical run: "I'm very glad Amazon sees this movie as the event that it is, and is treating it that way."

Texto completo: GOP media battler Dan Bongino has made good on his plans to create a news site that would be more like the Drudge Report than the real Drudge Report. And it almost imploded his server.
Bongino, who hosts a widely subscribed Dan Bongino Show podcast, had 20,000 users on his site just an hour after it went live on Wednesday. “Interest has been through the roof,” he said of the Bongino Report.
Like Drudge, it aggregates stories, especially those of interest to conservatives. Unlike Drudge, it generally won’t pick up stories from sources critics dub “fake news,” such as the New York Times or CNN.
Tweet
Bongino started the site because he felt that in recent months, Drudge has highlighted too many anti-Trump stories he believes aren’t true. It’s a complaint also heard in the White House.
But he doesn’t call his page a competitor or Drudge challenger. “I am not competing with anybody. I wish them all the best,” he said.
“I don’t want to steal Drudge’s thing,” he told me. “I have an agenda: Freedom and liberty. It’s no more complicated than that.”
He’s not the only news aggregator in the alternative Drudge space.
Tweet
Notably, Citizen Free Press has exploded in traffic recently.
Founder "Citizen Kane," told us, “CFP started the year averaging 100,000 page views per day, and now we can hit 600,000 on a good day, and still virtually no one knows about Citizen Free Press.” He said he receives 15 million page views a month compared to Drudge’s 500 million, according to Quantcast.
And while Bongino has a long list of media friends helping to spread the word, Citizen Free Press is a one-man band with no advertising or publicity, just like Matt Drudge when he started.
The Bongino Report looks like a modern news site, well designed with a special feature that shows shadow headlines on many stories. Citizen Free Press has taken Drudge’s old school look to an extreme and stands apart with edgy headlines.
But unlike Bongino, CFP is a direct challenge to Drudge.
“Matt Drudge has worn out his welcome with conservatives and Trump voters alike,” said the founder.
“Citizen Free Press was founded two years ago and has benefited greatly from the shift away from Drudge,” he said, adding, “We welcome super Dan Bongino to the space and wish him much success. We're all on the same team, trying to provide conservative news junkies with their daily fix of truth they won't hear anywhere in the anti-Trump media industrial complex.”

Texto completo: The Barebones Black Box Theatre in Braddock has built a reputation for bringing edgy, entertaining and thought-provoking plays to the stage. Its current production, "Dance Nation," is no exception.
"Dance Nation" is a comedy/drama by Clare Barron that played to off-Broadway audiences in New York last year. But while it strikes to the core of the kind of shows Barebones does, this is the first time the theater's artistic director, Patrick Jordan, has had to hire a choreographer.
"People hear about it and they're like, 'this doesn't really suit Barebones.' And I'm like, 'Come see the play.' It's a Barebones play," Jordan said.
Back story
A finalist for the 2019 Pulitzer Prize in Drama, "Dance Nation" revolves around the members of a competitive dance troupe of 11- to 13-year-old girls training for nationals. The twist is that the dancers are played by actresses ranging in age from their 20s to their 60s.
As New York Times reviewer Ben Brantley explained it after the play opened last year, "Whether you admit it or not, your 13-year-old self is still living somewhere inside you like a feral demon-child whispering in the dark. It is a creature of frightening extremes, this being you once were."
Director Melissa Martin said "Dance Nation" looks at dance as an allegory for the idea of learning to be aggressive as a woman and compete in the world.
"It's asking the question, 'What would have happened to women if, at 13, they were able to maintain the ferocity that they had at 13?' It looks at this transition between 12 and 13 as being a pivotal point in the evolution of who women become," said Martin.
"When we leave childhood and become teenagers and puberty takes over and you start to conform to societal expectations, what does that do to you?"
Jordan said there are backstage and dressing room scenes in "Dance Nation" that might make audience members squirm with discomfort.
"Some people might be offended by the language, but if you've ever heard a 13-year-old talk behind closed doors ...
"It's very real and it doesn't pull any punches. At one point, there are nine actors up there dancing and we've got it all cramped into our little postage stamp of a theater. This shows we're capable of doing anything."
Choreographer engaged
And while there are plenty of dance numbers in the play, the playwright did not want professional dancers in all the roles. Still, a choreographer was needed to get the performers in step. The job was given to Tomé Cousin, who teaches dance at Carnegie Mellon University and performs internationally. He made Jordan happy from the start.
"We had a dance audition and I'm sitting there in our theater in Braddock and Tomé calls out ... 'five, six, seven, eight' ... and eight people start doing a time-step and I'm like 'Oh my God, this is amazing!' I was just giddy," Jordan said.
In the play, the dancers are drilled by the character known as Dance Teacher Pat played like a football coach by actor David Conrad, known for his work in the TV series "Ghost Whisperer." Conrad, a Pittsburgh native, also appeared earlier this season in "The Legend of Georgia McBride" at Barebones.
"Dance Teacher Pat is at times inspiring and at times cruel. But it's because he absolutely 100% believes in competitive dance like it's a religion," Martin said. "There are times where we see that there might be something else going on underneath it, but he's primarily interested in winning."
The play looks more at the mothers, said Martin, and how they respond to the girls and what they want from their daughters in terms of being whole human beings.
"It's a bit of a protest play but it's also a big celebration of the potential of girls," Martin said.
The cast includes Mita Ghosal, Liron Blumenthal, Mei Lu Barnum, Hope Anthony, Lissa Brennan, Cary Anne Spear, and Jerreme Rodriguez.
"Dance Nation" opened in late November and runs through Dec. 15.
"We've got people laughing, we've got people crying, and we've got some people that might be offended by the language but there is so much heart in this play and it comes across," Jordan said. "Some people feel like they're watching an acid trip. Some people feel like they're watching an after-school special."
But Martin warns that just because so much of the play is focused on 13-year-olds, it's probably not a good idea to bring your preteen to this play.
"Like all Barebones shows, it's for adults. This play has an awful lot of language about body parts and celebrating body parts, it's out there and I think most people would not be happy if they brought their 13-year-old to it."

Anne Hathaway on 'heartbreaking' eco-drama 'Dark Waters'

Texto completo: Anne Hathaway didn't have to dig deep for her latest role in "Dark Waters."
In Todd Haynes' whistleblower drama, the Oscar winner plays the real-life Sarah Bilott, whose husband, lawyer Rob Bilott (Mark Ruffalo), helped expose decades of environmental contamination by chemical company DuPont.
"It's heartbreaking and infuriating on a human level," Hathaway says. "There wasn't really any acting required, in terms of playing someone who was learning of (corruption) and was equal parts aghast and terrified and angry and emotional."
Based on a 2016 New York Times Magazine article by Nathaniel Rich, "Dark Waters" begins with Rob taking on a new client: a West Virginia farmer (Bill Camp) who believes his cows' mysterious deaths are caused by a toxic runoff from a DuPont landfill, which contaminated a creek on his land.
Rob's work eventually leads to a study that finds roughly 70,000 people were drinking tainted water with traces of PFOA, a toxic chemical used in the production of Teflon products such as non-stick pans until 2013. DuPont was allegedly aware for years that PFOA exposure is linked to illnesses such as kidney cancer and thyroid disease, and the company was forced to pay out $671 million in personal injury lawsuits in 2017.
The story hit close to home for Hathaway, 37, already a mom to son Jonathan, 3, with husband Adam Shulman, and now "a thousand months pregnant" with a second child, she says good-naturedly by phone.
After reading the script, "I opened the drawer where I keep my pans and pots, and there was a non-stick pan," Hathaway says. "And despite reading an article when I was pregnant with my first child that said 'don't use non-stick,' there was one that had somehow slipped through the cracks and I'd been feeding my family with it for years.
"I try not to blame myself too hard in those circumstances, because I believe that we as human beings and as Americans should never be put in that position where we're just trying to do our best, and we're inadvertently poisoning ourselves and the people we love."
Hathaway has always had an activist spirit, which is part of the reason why Haynes thought of her to play Sarah.
"Anne has this incredible vitality and intelligence and compassion, and you see that in her work," says the director, best known for the Oscar-nominated "Carol" and "Far from Heaven." "Sarah is an essential part of the story of Rob and how he was able to do what he did, but also how hard it is on a domestic relationship when somebody takes on the system."
A vocal member of the Time's Up movement against sexual harassment and workplace discrimination, Hathaway credits her activism to her parents, who instilled the importance of equality and inclusivity from an early age.
"I was born in the early '80s, and there were still things I was told I couldn't do because I was a girl," Hathaway says. "I was really lucky I was raised in a household where that sentence was never uttered. It seems strange to me that anybody would try to put me in a box based on the way I was born, when it's so much easier to just accept other people for how they are. So I guess that was my first awareness that the world wasn't a fair place for everyone."
The actress says she is grateful for her "Dark Waters" co-star Ruffalo, who has long spoken out about climate change and fracking. She also feels encouraged by the work of 16-year-old Greta Thunberg and other young environmental activists.
After roles in "Serenity" and "The Hustle" earlier this year, Anne Hathaway is back on the big screen this fall with "Dark Waters," pictured, which tackles industrial pollution.

Texto completo: Anne Hathaway didn't have to dig deep for her latest role in "Dark Waters."
In Todd Haynes' whistleblower drama, the Oscar winner plays the real-life Sarah Bilott, whose husband, lawyer Rob Bilott (Mark Ruffalo), helped expose decades of environmental contamination by chemical company DuPont.
"It's heartbreaking and infuriating on a human level," Hathaway says. "There wasn't really any acting required, in terms of playing someone who was learning of (corruption) and was equal parts aghast and terrified and angry and emotional."
Based on a 2016 New York Times Magazine article by Nathaniel Rich, "Dark Waters" begins with Rob taking on a new client: a West Virginia farmer (Bill Camp) who believes his cows' mysterious deaths are caused by a toxic runoff from a DuPont landfill, which contaminated a creek on his land.
Rob's work eventually leads to a study that finds roughly 70,000 people were drinking tainted water with traces of PFOA, a toxic chemical used in the production of Teflon products such as non-stick pans until 2013. DuPont was allegedly aware for years that PFOA exposure is linked to illnesses such as kidney cancer and thyroid disease, and the company was forced to pay out $671 million in personal injury lawsuits in 2017.
The story hit close to home for Hathaway, 37, already a mom to son Jonathan, 3, with husband Adam Shulman, and now "a thousand months pregnant" with a second child, she says good-naturedly by phone.
After reading the script, "I opened the drawer where I keep my pans and pots, and there was a non-stick pan," Hathaway says. "And despite reading an article when I was pregnant with my first child that said 'don't use non-stick,' there was one that had somehow slipped through the cracks and I'd been feeding my family with it for years.
"I try not to blame myself too hard in those circumstances, because I believe that we as human beings and as Americans should never be put in that position where we're just trying to do our best, and we're inadvertently poisoning ourselves and the people we love."
Hathaway has always had an activist spirit, which is part of the reason why Haynes thought of her to play Sarah.
"Anne has this incredible vitality and intelligence and compassion, and you see that in her work," says the director, best known for the Oscar-nominated "Carol" and "Far from Heaven." "Sarah is an essential part of the story of Rob and how he was able to do what he did, but also how hard it is on a domestic relationship when somebody takes on the system."
A vocal member of the Time's Up movement against sexual harassment and workplace discrimination, Hathaway credits her activism to her parents, who instilled the importance of equality and inclusivity from an early age.
"I was born in the early '80s, and there were still things I was told I couldn't do because I was a girl," Hathaway says. "I was really lucky I was raised in a household where that sentence was never uttered. It seems strange to me that anybody would try to put me in a box based on the way I was born, when it's so much easier to just accept other people for how they are. So I guess that was my first awareness that the world wasn't a fair place for everyone."
The actress says she is grateful for her "Dark Waters" co-star Ruffalo, who has long spoken out about climate change and fracking. She also feels encouraged by the work of 16-year-old Greta Thunberg and other young environmental activists.
"I'm so inspired by them – their priorities are exactly right," Hathaway says. "They are focused and doing all the things we tell young people to do. So I don't understand people's negative reaction to this generation, except to say they must be very comfortable with the greed innate in the status quo."

Texto completo: Review
'Dark Waters'
1/2
Credits: Directed by Todd Haynes, starring Mark Ruffalo, Anne Hathaway, Tim Robbins, Bill Camp, Victor Garber, Mare Winningham
Running time/rating: 2:07, PG-13 for mature thematic elements, disturbing images and strong language
There are a few notable disappearing acts being performed in "Dark Waters," a fact-based - and decidedly unflashy - drama about the corporate lawyer who sued DuPont for, in essence, poisoning a West Virginia community with a chemical used to make Teflon.
The most obvious one is undertaken by the film's producer and star, Mark Ruffalo, who, as real-life Cincinnati attorney Rob Bilott, erases his movie-star persona beneath an unflattering haircut, cheap suit, bad posture and the ever-present pout (and jutting lower lip) of an avenging nebbish.
The second is by Bill Camp as Wilbur Tennant, the Parkersburg cattle farmer who first noticed that his cows were dying off in high numbers and who sought the assistance of Bilott because Tennant knew the lawyer's mother.
We're used to seeing Camp, one of the great unsung character actors, vanish inside a role, and here he does it again delivering his lines with a gruff affect and thick accent that is unintelligible much of the time. It's not a flaw of the performance. This detail is wholly accurate according to the New York Times article that inspired the film.
But perhaps the most superficially startling disappearing act is the one performed by the film's director, Todd Haynes, who brings a sort of aggressive stylelessness to a subject that initially seems a surprising choice for the director of the lavishly cinematic period pieces "Carol" and "Far From Heaven."
It is arguably not that much of a departure for a shapeshifting filmmaker whose varied résumé also includes a film in which six actors play Bob Dylan; the glam-rock musical "Velvet Goldmine"; and his 43-minute breakout film "Superstar" - the story of singer Karen Carpenter told entirely with Barbie and Ken dolls. And let's not forget "Safe," in which Julianne Moore played a woman with multiple chemical sensitivities.
But "Dark Waters" feels like the kind of issue film that almost anyone could have made. The issue, in this case, being not just about DuPont - a company that, as evidence in the film shows, was aware of the dangers of its Teflon ingredients for many years before Bilott's fight - but the fight for stronger environmental protections against corporate malfeasance.
The film's production company, Participant Media, has launched a campaign - in conjunction with Ruffalo, wearing his activist hat - titled "Fight Forever Chemicals." The term refers to often-toxic man-made substances that do not break down in the environment and build up in humans and animals over time.
As such, "Dark Waters" is an effective outrage machine: If you like "Erin Brockovich," you'll probably like this, too, although Ruffalo's schlubby crusader, despite the clunker he drives and his degree from what we're told is a "no-name" law school, doesn't have quite the same working-class pizazz that Julia Roberts brought to that 2000 role.
Anne Hathaway, playing Bilott's wife, is one performer who never quite disappears into her character, always seeming like the glamorous Hollywood actress in search of an Oscar moment, in what amounts to a thankless supporting role.
Still, "Dark Waters" is a solidly built film - because of its lack of features rather than despite it. There are other good performances, including Tim Robbins' turn as Bilott's conflicted boss, the head of the corporate law firm who let his employee bite the hand that feeds them.
But Victor Garber doesn't bring much nuance to the role of an obstructionist DuPont attorney, and Bill Pullman, who shows up late in the game as a country lawyer who helps Bilott drive home the knife in the case against the chemical giant, seems to have based his performance on every cinematic legal shark hiding behind an aw-shucks grin who has come before him.
"Dark Waters" doesn't aspire to be something it's not. Like Bilott himself, it gets the job done - not by showboating but by laying out the facts.

Did Politico fault Ukraine on 2016 U.S. election?

Texto completo: Republicans have asserted in recent weeks that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election. Their source often traces back to a 2017 investigation in Politico.

Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., repeated the talking point Dec. 1 on NBCs Meet the Press.

I think both Russia and Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election, he said during the program. Russia was very aggressive, and theyre much more sophisticated. But the fact that Russia was so aggressive does not exclude the fact that (then-Ukrainian President Petro) Poroshenko actively worked for Secretary Clinton.

Pressed by host Chuck Todd about whether Kennedy was concerned he was promoting Russian propaganda, Kennedy cited a variety of media reports about Ukrainian actions in 2016  including the 2017 Politico story. I believe the reporting by the Politico magazine, he said.

Allies of Donald Trump and Republican lawmakers have repeatedly referenced the article in interviews and congressional hearings during the impeachment inquiry against the president, which centers on his interactions with Ukraine.

PolitiFact decided to take a closer look at the Politico story to outline what it does  and doesnt  show about Ukraines involvement in 2016.

At more than 5,000 words in length, the Politico article delves into 2016 efforts by Ukranians to bring attention to Paul Manafort, then Trumps campaign chair. They hoped to discredit Manafort by publicizing his work on behalf of a previous, Russia-aligned government of Ukraine. Some of the articles key points are based on anonymous sourcing.

The article itself cautions that the actions of the Ukrainians to oppose Trump were not as expansive or as centrally controlled as the election interference by Russia. But those nuances have been ignored by Trump allies, who have chosen to play up the Ukrainian efforts outlined in the article rather than the more extensively documented Russian meddling.

What the article says

In the January 2017 article, Kenneth Vogel and David Stern reported that Ukrainian government officials tried to boost Hillary Clintons chances of winning the election.

The report said Ukrainian officials tried to sway the election in favor of Clinton by publicly questioning Trumps fitness for office; disseminating documents implicating Paul Manafort, Trumps former campaign manager, in corruption; and working with a Democratic National Committee contractor to dig up dirt about Trump and his advisers.

Alexandra Chalupa, the consultant mentioned in the story, revealed some findings to Ukrainian embassy officials and the DNC, according to Politico. The story does not say the DNC authorized Chalupas research or worked directly with either Ukraines government or the Clinton campaign. Our reporting has come to a similar conclusion.

Politico also cited several instances in which Ukrainian officials pushed back against Trumps comments that Russias annexation of Crimea should be accepted as a done deal. For instance, Ukraines U.S. ambassador had an op-ed in the Hill that said Trumps words sent the wrong message. And Ukraines minister of internal affairs tweeted that Trump posed an even bigger danger to the US than terrorism.

Politico reported that such efforts promoted the narrative that Trumps campaign had ties to Russia, Ukraines political foe, and helped force Manaforts resignation.

Politicos investigation found evidence of Ukrainian government involvement in the race that appears to strain diplomatic protocol dictating that governments refrain from engaging in one anothers elections, Vogel and Stern wrote.

But the article also states that the attempt wasnt comparable in scale to Russias meddling in the election, which was outlined at length in former special prosecutor Robert Muellers report. The Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election in sweeping and systematic fashion, the Mueller report said, citing everything from Russian spy agency hacking to coordinated social media efforts.

According to Politicos article, Russias effort was personally directed by Russian President Vladimir Putin (and) involved the countrys military and foreign intelligence services, according to U.S. intelligence officials, they wrote. Theres little evidence of such a top-down effort by Ukraine.

What the publications say now

Vogel, now a reporter with the New York Times, has defended his reporting. I stand by the story. It was both accurate and prescient, revealing the genesis of Trumps grudge against Ukraine, he told PolitiFact.

Politico and Stern, Vogels co-author, have noted that the article told one part of a very large story and drew a distinction between what it said Ukrainians did and what Russia has been shown to have done.

When you dig down into the details, the efforts by Ukraine and Russia were very, very different, Stern said on CNN in July 2017. What we said in the article is that we dont have, as far as we can see, the type of top-down and wide, broad attack on the American election that was being alleged.

The article did not state that the Ukrainian government conspired with the Clinton campaign or the DNC, said Melissa Cooke, a booking manager for Politico, in an email. It also emphasized that the acts of Ukrainian officials to raise questions about Trump were not comparable to Russias interference in the 2016 election, and reported that the then-Ukrainian government was trying to make amends with then-President-elect Trump.

In an interview, Peter Canellos, the Politico editor-at-large who edited Vogel and Sterns investigation, said the article is a deeply factual story that has never been challenged.

Kennedys office did not respond to our request for comment.

Was the Ukrainian president involved?

The Politico article does not clearly back up the specific claim by Kennedy that President Poroshenko actively worked for Secretary Clinton. Kennedy was sharing anonymous assertions from the article and ignoring contrary evidence that was also presented in the story.

The only voice in the Politico article suggesting that Poroshenko was personally involved in anti-Trump or pro-Clinton efforts was an anonymous operative who has worked extensively in Ukraine. He said it was something that Poroshenko was probably aware of and could have stopped if he wanted to.

But Politico also reported that Poroshenkos camp disputed the notion that they were behind the anti-Trump efforts, going into significant detail about how the presidents office separated itself from efforts to publicize Manaforts connections.

So at most, the Politico article offers an anonymous operative speculating that Poroshenko could have opposed the efforts targeting Manafort (and indirectly, Trump) but didnt. But Kennedy ignores Poroshenkos spokesmans forceful denial in the Politico story.

Why Ukraine had reason to worry in 2016

Republicans attempts to pin election interference on Ukraine ignore the real policy difference that Ukrainian officials had with candidate Trump.

Ukraine had just recently lost part of its territory, Crimea, to Russia. In 2014, within days of the removal of Ukraines pro-Russia president, Russian special forces were activated on the Crimean Peninsula, where Russia had a key naval base. The special forces occupied the regional parliament, and in short order, residents there voted in a referendum to ally with Russia. The fairness of the vote was criticized, but by the end of March, Crimea became part of Russia.

The Obama administration strongly opposed Russias action on Crimea, but Trump seemed to support it. In a July 31, 2016, ABC News interview, Trump suggested that the people of Crimea, from what Ive heard, would rather be with Russia than where they were.

Ukrainian officials heard Trump repeating a Russian justification for aggression. They argued against that in an op-ed from Ukraines ambassador and social media posts from officials.

If you are ambassador, you cant accept Putin talking points from anybody, Anders Åslund said. Its not a matter of taking a stand in the election. It was just to set the record right.

What the article doesnt say

One of the claims that allies of Trump have used to bolster the narrative that Ukraine targeted Trump in 2016 does not appear in the article  a conspiracy about the hack of the Democratic National Committee.

Trump and his allies have floated the theory that the cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike hid a server of Clintons emails from a 2016 intelligence community investigation  and that Ukraine somehow controlled Crowdstrike. We found no evidence that Crowdstrike ever worked on issues around Clintons private email server. Crowdstrike was involved in investigating the hack of the Democratic National Committee, which is altogether different from the Clinton emails. Intelligence officials have warned lawmakers that the conspiracy has been promoted by a yearslong Russian campaign to frame Ukraine for the hack.

Fiona Hill, a former official at the U.S. National Security Council, pushed back against some of those false narratives in her public testimony to the House Intelligence Committee on Nov. 21.

Some of you on this committee appear to believe that Russia and its security services did not conduct a campaign against our countryand that perhaps, somehow, for some reason, Ukraine did. This is a fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves, Hill said.

Still playing &#xa0;Putin’s game

Texto completo: President Donald Trump and his defenders simply won’t stop playing into Russia’s hands by promoting the debunked conspiracy theory that Ukraine hacked the 2016 election in an effort to sabotage his candidacy.
On Sunday, Sen. John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, was on Meet the Press spreading this disinformation. “I think both Russia and Ukraine interfered,” he said. Russia may have been more aggressive and sophisticated, he allowed, but “that does not exclude the fact that President Poroshenko actively worked for Secretary Clinton.”
There is no evidence that former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko conspired with the Clinton campaign. American intelligence agencies unanimously agree that Russia perpetrated the hacking.
Kennedy went even further a week earlier, when he suggested on Fox News Sunday that, in fact, Ukraine had hacked the Democratic computer server, obtaining emails that embarrassed Hillary Clinton’s campaign. (The next day he told CNN’s Chris Cuomo: “I was wrong. It was Russia who tried to hack the computer. I’ve seen no indication that Ukraine tried to do it.” It is unclear what changed his mind. Again.)
Kennedy is not alone in his historical denialism. Despite reports this week that the Republican-controlled Senate Intelligence Committee had checked out the allegations against Ukraine and found no evidence worth pursuing, Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina, the committee’s chairman, told reporters on Monday that he didn’t “think there’s any question that elected officials in Ukraine” favored Clinton.
Somewhere, President Vladimir Putin of Russia must be smiling.
Much of the House Intelligence Committee’s report on Tuesday about its impeachment inquiry involved the president’s demands that releasing military aid to Ukraine be conditioned on its announcing investigations into Joe Biden and his son. But of all the efforts to defend Trump, legitimizing his efforts to have Ukraine investigate the 2016 election may be the most egregious, since it helps Moscow deflect blame for its assault on American democracy.
In her testimony before the House Intelligence Committee on Nov. 21, Fiona Hill, the former top Russia expert at the National Security Council, chided lawmakers for spreading a “fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves.”
Senators received classified briefings from intelligence officials this fall detailing Moscow’s multiyear effort to spin that tale and pin its malfeasance on Ukraine. Trump’s first homeland security adviser, Tom Bossert, was one of multiple staffers to assure the president that the allegations about Ukraine were unfounded. On Tuesday, an undersecretary of state, David Hale, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that none of the allegations of Ukrainian interference were true.
But if anything, support among Republican legislators for the conspiracy theory continues to grow.
Time and again during the impeachment hearings, House Republicans sought to distract from, or even justify, Trump’s attempt to strong-arm Ukraine by floating the specter of Ukrainian saboteurs. Rep. Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the Intelligence Committee, called for the panel to refocus its investigation on the former Soviet republic.
This whole fantasm haunts Washington in tandem with Attorney General William Barr’s aggressive efforts to discredit the FBI investigation of Russian ties to the 2016 Trump campaign. The Justice Department’s inspector general has reportedly concluded that the basis of that investigation was legitimate and that claims of deep-state manipulation were nonsense, leaving Barr fuming.
To be clear, plenty of Ukrainians openly opposed Trump’s candidacy for fear he was too supportive of Putin. Trump’s public acceptance of Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea prompted particular concern. So did ties between Paul Manafort, Trump’s former campaign chairman, and pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine. Serhiy Leshchenko, an anti-corruption crusader and former member of Ukraine’s Parliament, worked to publicize secret payments Manafort received for his work in Ukraine, which eventually led to Manafort’s resignation from the campaign.
But beginning in 2017, if not before, the Kremlin went to work spinning such episodes into an elaborate conspiracy theory aimed at framing Ukraine.
In Trump, Putin found the perfect dupe to promote even the most crackpot of theories. Trump’s ego has long chafed at the idea that Russia meddled on his behalf, believing it to undercut his electoral achievement. Plus, accepting that Putin orchestrated such an effort would complicate Trump’s cozy relationship with him. From the president’s perspective, far better to believe there is a secret DNC server hidden in some rich Ukrainian businessman’s basement.
The dissemination of such folderol is a triple win for Putin. It distracts from the Kremlin’s past — and continuing — work to undermine American elections even as it erodes political support in the United States for Ukraine’s fight against Russian domination. More broadly, the dueling Ukraine narratives are fomenting division and confusion among the American public, an enduring goal of Putin’s. The Russian president is clearly delighted by the success of his disinformation crusade. “Thank God no one is accusing us anymore of interfering in the U.S. elections,” he said at a conference in Moscow last month. “Now they’re accusing Ukraine. We’ll let them deal with that themselves.”
That should make it clear whose interest Trump and congressional Republicans are serving.

Texto completo: Portland singer Kalie Shorr turned out one of the 10 best albums of 2019, at least in the opinion of a critic at The New York Times.
On Thursday, the Times released two lists of the top 10 albums of the year, by music critics Jon Pareles and Jon Caramanica. At No. 7 on Caramanica's list was "Open Book" by Shorr, a Portland native who has been writing and recording pop and country songs in Nashville for the past few years.
Caramanica wrote that Shorr's debut "is the sort of gut-wrenching album made by someone who understands how vital and detailed country music can be, and who is faithful to its heritage, including its lineage of resistance. Everyone in Nashville is likely hoping to sandpaper her into something just a little bit less confrontational; fingers crossed that doesn't happen."
Shorr, 25, said in an email to the Press Herald that she was still a little stunned by the news. The album, which is her first, came out in September.
"Honestly, I can't even believe it. I poured my entire heart and soul (even the darkest corners) in this album. ... To have that be received by fans and critics alike is all I could have hoped for," Shorr wrote.
She said she was honored to be on the lists with some of her favorite albums, including "Norman ____ Rockwell" by Lana Del Rey and "Clarity" by Kim Petras.
Shorr grew up in Portland and began writing songs when she was 6 or 7. While a student at Deering High School, she garnered national attention for You Tube videos she made, singing and playing guitar. After high school, she moved to Nashville, taking menial jobs and singing and writing when she could. In 2017, she was named one of the Next Women of Country by the country music cable network CMT. In February 2018, she went on a nationwide tour with country star Sara Evans and has played at The Grand Ole Opry more than a dozen times.
She performed at Aura in Portland in November as part of the Let the Girls Play concert event, a benefit for Girl Scouts of Maine.
"Lullaby" from Kalie Shorr's debut album, "Open Book"

A Seminal German Work Adopts a Texan Accent

Texto completo: Before the start of Heartbeat Opera's production of Weber's "Der Freischütz," which opened on Wednesday at the Baruch Performing Arts Center in Manhattan, Louisa Proske, who conceived and co-directed the staging, told the audience that the mission of this small but ambitious company was to present "radical adaptations" of familiar works.
On that count, this inventive "Freischütz" delivered. The story was shifted from a rustic community in mid-1600s Bohemia to a town in contemporary Texas. Yet the updating was actually the least radical element.
"Der Freischütz," which loosely translates as "The Marksman" and runs at Baruch through Dec. 14, takes place in the aftermath of the Thirty Years' War. It is a culture in which hunting and marksmanship are rituals of manhood; where rowdy gatherings at the local tavern and sentimental paeans to healthy rural life go hand in hand; and where citizens are prone to superstition and see evil forces at work everywhere.
The translation of this story into contemporary American life was "disturbingly easy," as Chloe Treat, Ms. Proske's co-director, said in a recent interview with The New York Times. The Texas town we encounter here -- centered on a ramshackle tavern, in Sara Brown's imaginative set -- is steeped in toxic masculinity, gun culture and the demonization of outsiders.
Weber's main character, Max, is a decent but weak-willed assistant forester who wants to inherit the top job -- and with it the de facto leadership of the town -- from Kuno, as well as marry Kuno's winsome daughter, Agathe. But first he must prove himself in a shooting contest. In this staging, Kuno became the town's sheriff, with Max his earnest but bumbling deputy, routinely subjected to bullying by the community's young alpha men.
Many opera stagings update works in just this way. But Heartbeat Opera is far more unusual in its tweaking (and trimming) of librettos and its reorchestration of scores. Passages of spoken dialogue in this "Freischütz" have been rewritten and are delivered with salty American slang. And the music director, Daniel Schlosberg, has effectively transformed Weber's colorful score for seven players, some on multiple instruments.
But that's not all. For Weber's most original scene, which takes place in the haunted Wolf's Glen, Mr. Schlosberg has transformed the orchestration into a collage of electronic and acoustic sounds, in effect a recomposition, set here in the smoky, mysterious Wolf Canyon.
Why not? "Der Freischütz," a seminal German opera first performed in 1821, remains a rarity in America. Weber dared to mix opulent arias and ensembles with catchy songs and dances, hints of folk tunes and spoken drama, all to conjure a world of both everyday life and fantasy. Heartbeat's production team wanted to delve into the work's disturbing, timely subtexts by streamlining and modernizing it. They succeed.
The most daring adaptation concerns the character of Kaspar, Max's rival, who has made a Faustian pact with a devilish spirit, Samiel (here played by the sinewy dancer Azumi O E). Heartbeat's Kaspar is a returning Iraq war veteran -- a brutish and maniacal but surprisingly sympathetic character, sung on Wednesday by the robust bass-baritone Derrell Acon. (The main roles are double cast for the run.)
Weber's Kaspar draws on dark spirits to lure Max into a web of darkness. Heartbeat's version, by contrast, is a cynical realist who knows firsthand what killing involves. Where he has been, marksmanship is not just proof of manliness, but also means of survival.
The husky-voiced tenor Ian Koziara made a vulnerable Max, hamstrung by bullying and desperate to find some means -- any means -- to prevail. The soprano Summer Hassan brought an ample, dark-hued voice to Agathe. Quentin Oliver Lee as Kilian, a big-shot townsman, and Kevin McGuire, as Kuno, were both excellent. The bright-voiced soprano Jana McIntyre was wonderful as Annchen, Agathe's sassy cousin.
While the dialogue is spoken in English, all the music is sung in the original German. By keeping the music in the original language and style, the contrast between American ambience and classic Romanticism made a powerful impact. Here was a rare presentation of the work that would define 19th-century German opera, made topical in a way that both respected Weber and stretched him.

A concert to match Cage's 'mystical quality'

Texto completo: Cage
Presented by the Run AMOC! Festival. At The Ex, American Repertory Theater. Dec. 13-14,
6:30 p.m. $25-$35, 617-547-8300, www.americanrepertorytheater.org
In February 1948, John Cage gave a lecture at an arts conference at Vassar College in which he detailed his artistic development. Somewhere in the midst of the address, he casually mentioned that, on the suggestion of a friend, he had “two years ago start[ed] writing 20 short Sonatas and Interludes which I have not yet finished."
The pieces, he added, “have all been written in my new apartment on the East River in Lower Manhattan which turns its back to the city and looks to the water and the sky."
It was a remarkably succinct precis of what would become one of Cage's most venerated works, the Sonatas and Interludes for prepared piano. The image of Cage's composing space as a refuge from the tumult and commotion of New York, allowing the composer to seek a deeper and more private beauty, perfectly captures the music's mysterious aura. That rarefied character made it perhaps the closest to a canonical work in Cage's oeuvre, admired even by those who find Cage's later, chance-based music something akin to a sham. It is, in the words of Cage scholar James Pritchett, “a big piece with a quiet voice."
Last year, pianist Conor Hanick and director Zack Winokur found an innovative way to present the Sonatas and Interludes at the American Modern Opera Company's Run AMOC! Festival. Seated at a lidless piano in The Ex, the American Repertory Theater's small black box venue, with the audience surrounding him, Hanick played Cage's music while a subtle play of lighting (designed by Winokur, AMOC's co-artistic director) unfolded in the room. Choreographer Julia Eichten added an energetic dance component to the first interlude, performed largely in shadows. It was, according to the New York Times critic David Allen, “probably the best instrumental concert I have seen all year by virtue of its rethinking of the basics of what a recital might be."
“We all felt there was a mystical quality about the piece we wanted to explore in different ways," said Hanick, who will reprise “Cage" at this year's Run AMOC! “It's such a unique listening experience that I wanted the actual concertgoing act to be similar."
The Sonatas and Interludes are of central importance to Hanick, who first performed them in 2013 and has done so almost every season since. “It feels like a piece I've always known," he said via phone recently from his home in New York City. “The whole thing sounds like a whisper. There are these more resonant and clangorous moments, but I think at its heart, it's soliloquy, or a monologue, really, that is delivered in undertones."
The irony of the piece, Hanick pointed out, is that music of such otherworldly delicacy is created using the crudest of materials — screws, nuts, and bolts made of metal and rubber, all lodged in the piano strings in an arrangement that Cage lays out in the score with almost obsessive detail. (Preparing a piano for performance in this way takes around two to three hours.)
Yet Hanick found in earlier performances that following Cage's directions to the letter produced notably unsatisfying results. “You're measuring out three-and-a-half inches, you're using a furniture bolt between the first and second strings on [the note] A, you screw in the bolt, and it just sounds like a dead nothing," he said. “The note has no profile, it doesn't have a color, it just sounds like metal in a piano.
“It can't be that's what he meant," Hanick continued. “It's just inconceivable to me that he wanted the piece to sound that way." Once Hanick gave himself permission to slightly alter Cage's preparation instructions, “you just start creating these overtones and this other level of harmonicity with the instrument. And I think once that kind of becomes what you're looking for, you're getting more to the beauty of the piece."
Last year's AMOC production opened new dimensions of the Sonatas and Interludes for Hanick as well as for the audience. On one level, it allowed him to illuminate musical relationships and connections among the pieces in an unobtrusive way. But it also deepened the entire performative experience. “It draws the listener in when that's what's required, and allows the listener to pan out when that's required," he explained. “When you're sitting playing two or three sonatas in a row and the only light in the entire space is a very dim spotlight on the keyboard, it puts you in a different zone. There's no escaping what is going on in that very small space.
“The way that it's presented partly makes me play better," he added, “but it also creates this really intense cocoon for listening intently, which this piece really deserves."

Previews & Openings
'CHRISTMAS RAPPINGS' at the Judson Memorial Church (performances on Dec. 6 and 7). Fifty years ago, Al Carmines, a minister at the Judson Memorial Church and a key figure in the Off Off Broadway movement, premiered a holiday oratorio that captures, as he put it, "the human interest and the joy" of the nativity story. Nearly 50 performers, some of them original cast members, now revive it.
christmasrappings2019.brownpapertickets.com
'42FT: A MENAGERIE OF MECHANICAL MARVELS' at the New Victory Theater (performances start on Dec. 6). A steampunk circus reoriented for the proscenium stage, the latest show from this American company performs traditional circus acts with a few more gears and wheels. Highlights include log juggling, flying trapeze and a cantering mechanical horse. Chris Lashua and Aloysia Gavre direct.
646-223-3010, newvictory.org
'GREATER CLEMENTS' at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater at Lincoln Center Theater (in previews; opens on Dec. 9). In Samuel D. Hunter's new play, Judith Ivey stars as a woman who runs a mine tour and museum in an economically depressed and politically divided Idaho town. The return of an old boyfriend (Ken Narasaki) offers the possibility of escape. Will she take it? The director Davis McCallum, Hunter's longtime collaborator, digs deep.
212-239-6200, lct.org
'HALFWAY BITCHES GO STRAIGHT TO HEAVEN' at the Atlantic Theater Company at the Linda Gross Theater (in previews; opens on Dec. 9). A playwright who never met an expletive or a wounded heart he couldn't love, Stephen Adly Guirgis returns to the Atlantic with a big-cast, high-energy story of a women's halfway house in New York. Under John Ortiz's direction, the cast includes Patrice Johnson Chevannes, Liza Colón-Zayas and Elizabeth Rodriguez.
866-811-4111, atlantictheater.org
'HARRY CONNICK JR.: A CELEBRATION OF COLE PORTER' at the Nederlander Theater (performances start on Dec. 7). Delightful, delicious and potentially delovely, this concert pairs the American crooner and a 25-piece orchestra with one of the great practitioners of the American songbook. Will the evening be a trip to the moon on gossamer wings or just one of those things?
877-250-2929, harryconnickjr.com
[ Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead. ]
'JUDGMENT DAY' at the Park Avenue Armory (in previews; opens on Dec. 10). A different kind of trolley problem motors into the armory. Christopher Shinn adapts Odon von Horvath's 1937 play, both a tense drama and a political allegory exploring guilt and responsibility. Luke Kirby ("The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel") stars; Richard Jones directs.
212-616-3930, armoryonpark.org
'KEEP' at St. Ann's Warehouse (in previews; opens on Dec. 8). Diffident, aggressive and often startlingly funny, the storyteller Daniel Kitson brings his new work to Brooklyn. In a show that sounds less like a monologue and more like a job for Marie Kondo, Kitson attempts a digressive catalog of the 20,000-some possessions in his home.
718-254-8779, stannswarehouse.org
'ONE IN TWO' at the Pershing Square Signature Center (in previews; opens on Dec. 10). In Donja R. Love's new play, Jamyl Dobson, Leland Fowler and Edward Mawere star as three black queer men, one of whom is diagnosed with H.I.V., as Love ("Fireflies") was a decade ago. Stevie Walker-Webb directs for the New Group.
917-935-4242, thenewgroup.org
'ONE NOVEMBER YANKEE' at 59E59 Theaters (in previews; opens on Dec. 8). A crashed Piper Cub shapes the lives and arguments of three sibling pairs, all portrayed by Harry Hamlin ("L.A. Law") and Stefanie Powers ("Hart to Hart"). The play, which takes its name from the aircraft's registration, is directed by its writer, Joshua Ravetch.
646-892-7999, 59e59.org
'THE THIN PLACE' at Playwrights Horizons (in previews; opens on Dec. 12). The playwright Lucas Hnath ("Hillary and Clinton," "The Christians," "A Doll's House, Part 2") has a taste for alternative realities. This new play, directed by Les Waters, is about a medium (Randy Danson) and a young woman (Emily Cass McDonnell) who may have some extrasensory perceptions, too.
212-279-4200, playwrightshorizons.org
'WEST SIDE STORY' at the Broadway Theater (previews start on Dec. 10; opens on Feb. 6). Does Broadway feel pretty? Does Ivo van Hove? The celebrated and sometimes controversial Belgian director revives this Stephen Sondheim, Leonard Bernstein and Arthur Laurents musical, with new choreography by Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker, and one song and one ballet extracted. Isaac Powell and Shereen Pimentel star.
212-239-6200, westsidestorybway.com
Last Chance
'BETRAYAL' at the Bernard B. Jacobs Theater (closes on Dec. 8). Harold Pinter's chronologically tricky and emotionally sticky love triangle leaves the stage. Ben Brantley described Jamie Lloyd's production, starring Tom Hiddleston, Charlie Cox and Zawe Ashton, as "the most merciless and empathic interpretation of this much performed work I've seen." He added, "I didn't expect it to be one of those rare shows I seem destined to think about forever."
212-239-6200, betrayalonbroadway.com
'FOR COLORED GIRLS WHO HAVE CONSIDERED SUICIDE/WHEN THE RAINBOW IS ENUF' at the Public Theater (closes on Dec. 15). Leah C. Gardiner's ecstatic, anguished revival of Ntozake Shange's choreopoem reaches its end. Ben Brantley wrote that what is most pervasive in this production, which stars Jayme Lawson, Adrienne C. Moore and Okwui Okpokwasili, among others, is its "sense of women talking to -- and being deeply invested in -- one another, as if in an eternal support group."
212-967-7555, publictheater.org
'THE ROSE TATTOO' at the American Airlines Theater (closes on Dec. 8). Tennessee Williams's sunstruck, Florida-set comedy of sex and grief ends its run. Though Ben Brantley had some encouraging words for its stars Marisa Tomei and Emun Elliott, he noted that "it's a vaudevillian notion of sex they're presenting, the poignancy and poetry within their characters' coming together are mostly absent."
212-719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org
'SCOTLAND, PA' at the Laura Pels Theater at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater (closes on Dec. 8). Adam Gwon and Michael Mitnick's update of Shakespeare's "Macbeth," with '70s rock and a side of fries, places its final orders. Jesse Green noted that under Lonny Price's direction, it is not only funny, but also "quietly insightful, making piquant connections between Shakespeare's drama of political powerlust and the consumerist mania of our own fast-food culture."

Texto completo: The impeachment report shows that the president's personal lawyer was in frequent contact with the White House at key moments in the Ukraine pressure campaign.
Trump administration officials, seeking to weaken Democrats' case for impeachment, disputed on Thursday some of the details in the House Intelligence Committee's report about calls between President Trump's personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani and White House aides.
As part of its portrait of Mr. Trump's campaign of pressure on Ukraine, the committee's report released this week listed several calls between Mr. Giuliani and White House phone numbers, including one "associated with" the White House's Office of Management and Budget, cited in the report simply as "O.M.B. number."
Such calls suggested contact between Mr. Giuliani and key officials at significant moments during Mr. Trump's dealings with Ukraine. The budget office was involved in the administration's freeze on $ 391 million in security aid for Ukraine, a key lever in the president's pressure campaign.
But the phone number is a generic White House switchboard number, "(202) 395-0000," people familiar with the phone records said, making it difficult to tell whose desk it came from. While government directories list it as associated with the budget office, they also show the number as associated with offices in other parts of the White House, including the upper floors of the West Wing and the National Security Council.
A review of budget office call logs showed that no one spoke with Mr. Giuliani around the times of the calls in April and August, an O.M.B. official said. Mr. Giuliani did not speak with Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff and director of the budget office, whose name has come up in testimony about the aid freeze, a White House official said.
Still, administration officials have not contested the broader assertion that the impeachment report made with the call records: that Mr. Giuliani was in close contact with the White House as he carried out a shadow Ukraine policy pressing its new president to announce investigations that could benefit Mr. Trump politically.
Asked about the call labeling in the impeachment report, a senior Intelligence Committee official said the phone numbers appeared to be associated with the budget office based on public government directories.
The committee was still investigating the call records, including those identified in the report as connected to the budget office, said the official, who like others was not authorized to speak publicly.
The committee issued subpoenas to the White House and Mr. Giuliani asking for records that the official said would "clarify" who at the White House spoke with him. But both the White House and Mr. Giuliani defied those demands.
Mr. Giuliani has given different answers publicly about whether he spoke with anyone at the budget office.
On Tuesday, he told The New York Times that he had nothing to do with the administration's decision to withhold aid from Ukraine, which is fighting a war against Russian-backed forces in its east, and that his conversations with officials at the budget office related to other issues.
"I never discussed military assistance," he said. "I am expert on so many things it could have been some very esoteric subject."
But on Wednesday, he texted CNN that he did not "remember calling O.M.B. and not about military aid never knew anything about it."
Mr. Giuliani did not respond to a message seeking comment on Thursday.

According to reports, SAG-AFTRA has launched an investigation into the circumstances surrounding Gábriellé Union's departure from "America's Got Talent." In a statement sent to Variety on Dec. 1, a spokesperson for the performers' union said, "While we have taken steps to investigate this matter, we have nothing to report now." Variety reported exclusively that Union was let go from her rumored $12 million per season job on the NBC competition series after the actress spoke to producers about the alleged workplace toxic environment she endured and witnessed as a judge on the recent 14th season of the show. NBC issued a statement saying that it is "working with Ms. Union through her representatives to hear more about her concerns."
The film "Queen & Slim," starring Jodie Smith Turner and Daniel Kaluuya, was the name of the game over Thanksgiving weekend. First, the Queen of Entertainment, Beyoncé, along with her sister Solange, mother Tina Lawson, cousin Angela Beyince, and dear friend, Kelly Rowland, attended a screening of the film on Nov. 30 that was hosted by the movie's director, Melina Metsoukas. A friend of the family, Matsoukas also directed the music videos for several of Beyoncé's songs, including "Formation," as well as Solange's numbers "I Decided" and "Losing You." "Queen & Slim" came in number five at the box office with $11. 7 million.
Speaking of Rowland, the songstress/actress went a step further to help out "Queen & Slim" by buying out two screenings in her hometown of Houston, Texas at the AMC Willowbrook. Snoop Dogg also got in on the action by buying out a screening at Cinemark Baldwin Hills in Los Angeles on Nov. 29. Meanwhile, Snoop is releasing a lullaby album called "Lullaby Renditions of Snoop Dogg," which includes soothing instrumental versions of some of his biggest hits including "Drop It Like It's Hot," "Gin and Juice" and "Sensual Seduction."
The Green Room 42, the new intimate concert venue dubbed Broadway's "off-night hotspot" by the New York Times, will welcome back Tony Award winner Lillias White in a special new holiday concert, "A Lillias White Christmas," for three performances this season in New York City. The shows will take place on Friday, Dec. 13, Saturday, Dec. 14 and Sunday, Dec. 15. With music direction by James Sampline, the evening will feature Ms. White singing great holiday classics from stage, screen, radio and beyond.

Today is Walt Disney’s birthday; the iconic entrepreneur, animator, producer and dreamer would have been 118 years old. Under his leadership, the Walt Disney Company became a powerhouse of visionary entertainment for children as well as a multi-faceted conglomerate. Movies and cartoons, theme park attractions, merchandise—the works. Yet after his death in 1966, Disney endured a series of notable peaks and forgettable valleys over the next 40 years.
Today, the company is fighting off false accusations of being a monopoly due to becoming the No. 1 box office leader in all of entertainment. This is largely the result of Disney growing its blockbuster business through a number of savvy, branded acquisitions over the last 15 years. So in honor of the big man, let us revisit the major moves that perched Disney atop the industry.
Pixar
In 2006, the Walt Disney Company acquired Pixar Animation Studios for $7.4 billion. The deal marked one of the first major moves of CEO Bob Iger’s tenure. He and then-Pixar head Steve Jobs were negotiating the future of Pixar’s existing distribution deal with Disney when it morphed into a larger conversation about the future of both companies. Little did any of us know that it would be the first of several big splashes made during Iger’s stewardship.
“As we approached the end of our relationship with Disney and we looked at our future, we were at a fork in the road,” Jobs told the New York Times at the time. “Disney is the only company with animation in their DNA.”
The deal was largely motivated by Iger’s stated desire to acquire and create brand-name content for Disney consumers at a time when Disney’s in-house animation division was desperate for a hit. Pixar and DreamWorks had surpassed the Mouse House as the go-to destination for animated content and the Magic Kingdom needed to emerge from the funk of the Michael Eisner era.
Since the deal closed, Pixar has released 15 movies under Disney for a worldwide gross of more than $10 billion.
Marvel
In 2009, Disney acquired Marvel Entertainment for $4 billion. The move gave Disney control over the fledgling Marvel Cinematic Universe and a library of 5,000 characters. This deal sent a message that Iger was aggressively seeking out growth opportunities while the industry’s emphasis on scale and consolidation was still a few years away.
“Marvel’s brand and its treasure trove of content will now benefit from our extraordinary reach,” Iger said at the time. “We paid a price that reflects the value they’ve created and the value we can create as one company. It’s a full price, but a fair price.”
The MCU has gone on to become the single-most consistently-successful endeavor in Hollywood history and inspired rival studios to unsuccessfully chase its formula. Last year saw Marvel’s Black Panther score the superhero genre’s first-ever Best Picture nomination at the Academy Awards and this year saw Avengers: Endgame ($2.797 billion) surpass Avatar ($2.74 billion) as the highest-grossing film in history. As the MCU enters Phase IV, Marvel is preparing a handful of new blockbuster films and Disney+ series to further expand the brand.
Since the deal closed, Marvel has released 21 movies under Disney for a worldwide gross of more than $21 billion.
Lucasfilm
In 2012, Disney acquired Lucasfilm for $4 billion. The move gave Disney control of the Star Wars franchise, arguably America’s most beloved movie series. At the time, it was Disney’s fourth-largest acquisition ever. Iger acknowledged the name power it brought to the Mouse House’s reputation.
“This is one of the great entertainment properties of all time, one of the best branded and one of the most valuable, and it’s just fantastic for us to have the opportunity to both buy it, run it and grow it,” he said at the time.
Fans of the franchise had been left with a bad taste in their mouths by the oft-maligned prequel trilogy, released between 1999 and 2005. By the time Disney released The Force Awakens in 2015, Star Wars had been out of cinemas for 10 years and audiences quickly embraced its return. J.J. Abrams’ franchise relaunch went on to become the highest-grossing domestic film ever with more than $936 million.
Looking ahead, Lucasfilm has the grand conclusion to the Skywalker Saga arriving later this month, at least three live-action Disney+ series set in the Star Wars universe as well as a new season of the animated Clone Wars series, and at least one new big screen franchise in the works.
20th Century Fox
In March, Disney closed its acquisition of Fox’s entertainment assets for $71.3 billion. It is the company’s largest acquisition ever, surpassing the $19.7 billion buyout of Capital Cities/ABC in 1995. The move, completed against an aggressive pursuit by Comcast, marked a peak in media entertainment consolidation as Disney gobbled up a near 100-year-old storied studio, sparking both concern and excitement throughout different corners of the industry.
“This is an extraordinary and historic moment for us,” Iger said in a statement at the time.
The acquisition was largely driven by Iger’s desire to better position Disney as a direct-to-consumer force against the Netflixes of the world. As an acknowledgment that linear cable is in decline during the age of cord-cutting, Disney is pivoting toward online video and Fox’s assets will serve as a foundational building block in that effort.
The studio’s family-friendly content has landed on Disney’s new streaming service, Disney+. As part of the deal, Disney also took a majority stake in Hulu (later acquiring full ownership) and is planning to use basic cable network FX and indie/art-house subsidiary Fox Searchlight to prop up the streamer with exclusive content.
As of August, Fox posted a $170 million operating loss in Disney’s third quarter due to underperforming theatrical releases. Last month’s Ford v Ferrari , which has earned more than $145 million worldwide thus far, is the first big theatrical Fox success under Disney.

Editorial: Dems in Congress need to walk their talk, approve trade pact

Texto completo: Congressional Democrats have taken great umbrage at the suggestion they are so obsessed with trying to run President Donald Trump out of office via impeachment that they aren’t doing much heavy lifting when it comes to other issues of importance to the American people.
They could go a long way toward making that case by approving the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, better known as USMCA.
While there is some possible tinkering that could be easily done, there is no good reason not to approve this replacement for NAFTA. As the New York Times – not known as a defender of anything Trump – put it in a front-page story this week: “House Democrats return to Washington facing a difficult choice: Should they hand President Trump a victory in the midst of a heated impeachment battle or walk away from one of the most progressive trade pacts ever negotiated by either party?”
One would hope their sense of duty to country would prevail and this important agreement would move forward to votes in the House and Senate, with a simple majority required in each chamber. Two key players who should work to get that done are members of New Mexico’s delegation: assistant speaker Rep. Ben Ray Luján because of his leadership role and first-term Rep. Xochitl Torres Small, who represents the Second Congressional District, which borders Mexico.
USMCA is a good deal for all parties. In addition to requirements, for example, that more American-made parts must be included in vehicles manufactured in Mexico – with Mexican workers getting higher wages and collective bargaining guarantees – both Democrats and Republicans represent huge agricultural concerns that need USMCA to be ratified. Mexico already has done so with an almost unanimous vote in its upper chamber.
The U.S. International Trade Commission estimates the USMCA would result in $28 billion in new U.S. auto part purchases and create 76,000 U.S. auto jobs.
Journal contributing columnist Jerry Pacheco says about 6,000 jobs in this state are directly tied to trade with Mexico, along with “many jobs where people don’t even know their employment is ultimately tied to trade.”
And as for our neighbors to the south, Mexico’s economic ministry said Senate approval in that country “sends a clear message in favor of an open economy and of deepening its economic integration of the region.”
There is a real fear that if the agreement isn’t voted on this year, it will languish during a 2020 election campaign and end up being scrapped. That would be a travesty because as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said in an interview with Bloomberg News, USMCA is “the easiest trade deal that we’ve ever done.”
Richard Neal, D-Mass. and head of the Democrat group negotiating with the Trump administration over possible modifications, told the New York Times, “By any standard what we’ve already negotiated is substantially better than NAFTA.”
Democrats in Congress need to move this forward to a vote and approve it for the benefit of the American public and our North American trading partners.
Not doing so could disrupt our economies, decrease productivity and make us less competitive in the global market.
On the flip side, Pacheco noted, smooth ratification in Congress “can demonstrate to Americans and to the world that our lawmakers can still put aside deep-rooted differences and come together for the good of our nation and our neighbors.”
That would, indeed, be a lovely Christmas present.

Y lo hace cobrando precios exorbitantes.
Se trata de Omni Air International , la cual tiene contrato con el Departamento de Defensa de los Estados Unidos para el traslado de soldados y con el Departamento de Seguridad Nacional (DHS) para concretar deportaciones que ICE califica como “ misiones especiales de alto riesgo ”.
Un documento sobre el presupuesto de ICE obtenido por el sitio de noticias Quartz revela que se ha tenido que pagar prácticamente lo que la empresa pide por sus servicios aéreos, ya que es la única dispuesta a realizar esos vuelos especiales.
Un agente de viajes habría advertido a ICE que muchos operadores aéreos no quieren participar en el proceso de deportación ante una posible reacción negativa del público y el impacto en los medios de comunicación.
“Como resultado, nuestro grupo de selección de operadores se ha reducido a uno solo, Omni”, indica el documento de ICE.
El pasado 18 de noviembre ICE pagó $33,500 dólares por hora para trasladar a 166 inmigrantes que fueron deportados de Arizona a Bangladesh, India y Vietnam. Lo que cobró Omni es el doble del precio en el mercado, reconocen las autoridades.
Los inmigrantes detenidos que puedan ser perjudiciales durante un vuelo o que físicamente se rehúsen a ser deportados, serán enviados a su país en un vuelo chárter especial de alto riesgo, establece la unidad de Operaciones Aéreas de ICE .
Omni Air International es la encargada de esos vuelos especiales y también de los casos de deportación de alto perfil , como quienes son considerados una amenaza a la seguridad nacional, violadores de derechos humanos y detenidos con órdenes de arresto en el extranjero o que son buscados en su país de origen.
Esa misma aerolínea tiene operaciones comerciales en los aeropuertos de Las Vegas, Dallas, Seattle, Hawaii y Baltimore.
Otras compañías aéreas que han colaborado en la deportación de inmigrantes, en vuelos que no son de alto riesgo, son Xtra Airways , con sede en Florida y que ha realizado traslados a México y Centroamérica, al igual que Swift Air , que de acuerdo con el New York Times esta empresa estaría recibiendo $15 millones de dólares al año por el contrato que tiene con ICE.
En declaraciones públicas, algunas aerolíneas como American , Frontier y United han dejado en claro su rechazo a participar en la política de deportación del presidente Donald Trump .

Texto completo: Damariya Carlisle, age 9, jumped as an instructor hauled a crab pot onto the steel deck of the barge docked on the Elizabeth River, a Chesapeake tributary in Norfolk, Virginia.
She marveled at the Atlantic blue crabs’ claws but worried they might pinch her. The visit was part of a fourth-grade class trip in October.
“They get to see and feel real crabs,” said Janet Goldbach Ehmer, an educator with the Elizabeth River Project who pulled the trap from the water. “It helps to create a personal connection and investment in the river.”
The Elizabeth River Project received about $500,000 for youth resiliency education as part of a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration grant program to encourage children’s resilience when faced with climate-related disasters. The grants are intended to teach young people and adults to better respond to threats like sea-level rise, severe storms, flooding, drought and extreme heat.
A main focus of the grants is to encourage students to answer: “What can I do to make myself” - as well as my family and my community - “more resilient?” said Sarah Schoedinger, a senior program manager in NOAA’s education office. “How do we rebound to something” that might leave us in a position that is “better than before?”
The Elizabeth River Project welcomes up to 200 students a day on field trips to its 120-by-32-foot learning barge. It enlists the Atlantic blue crab as a means to teach students in the area about increased flooding and sea-level rise, nudging students toward actions they can take to reduce climate impacts.
“You don’t have to grow up to do these actions,” Goldbach Ehmer tells students. “You can start these actions today.”
After attending the program, Damariya vowed to turn off lights and computers more often.
Since 2015, NOAA’s Environmental Literacy Program has awarded nearly $10 million to 22 resiliency programs across the country, in both coastal and inland states.
The programs provide education, and projects include building rain barrels, planting trees, hosting resiliency expos, collecting environmental data and interviewing community members about extreme weather events. The approach is intended to help stave off the paralysis or anxiety that may occur when confronted with climate data that may feel overwhelming.
Robin Dunbar, Elizabeth River’s deputy director of education, said, “Our whole message has not been scary” or all “gloom and doom.” She added: “I’m not trying to just push cupcakes and unicorns. We do include real science for all ages.”
Several of the programs aim to empower students to take part in community resiliency planning.
“Sometimes, when talking about big environmental issues,” Dunbar said, “there’s this idea: We need the adults to figure this out. I always come in and say, ‘Let the kids have a part in this.’”
Over the summer, middle-school boys in a hazard resiliency program in Gunnison, Colorado, that caters to rural schools hashed out how to protect their small town at the base of the Rocky Mountains from an approaching wildfire as part of a board game that incorporates hazard survival strategies.
“The foothills closest to your community have been burning for several days and your community has been blanketed with smoke,” read one of the game’s emergency updates.
The game, developed by the Boulder-based Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences, is intended to prime students to help if a real flood, drought or fire threatens their communities. The institute received about $200,000 for the project, which is estimated to reach 600 students across Colorado.
Many of the programs target underserved communities.
“For youth and their families who live in underserved communities, this is not an abstract issue,” said Ethan Lowenstein, director of the Southeast Michigan Stewardship Coalition at Eastern Michigan University. Climate change can affect young people in ways that are not immediately obvious, Lowenstein said. For example, if sports fields flood, students miss practices and games, which may affect their ability to get scholarships.
The coalition is a partner in a program called Climate Resilience From the Youth Up, which brings together high school students, educators, scientists and community members in Detroit and southeast Michigan.
Grant recipients hope student enthusiasm will spur action in neighboring communities. Watershed Management Group, an environmental nonprofit in Tucson, Arizona, engages students to design and build rain gardens, using native plants and trees and diverting stormwater runoff from school buildings to water the gardens.
Students learn about extreme weather patterns and how rain gardens mitigate extreme heat and flooding. They calculate water flows and choose materials. Students and volunteers gather, typically on a Saturday, to build the gardens.
On a recent morning, Riley Fletcher, age 13, checked temperatures throughout the rain garden that stretches along a side of Drachman Montessori K-8 Magnet School in Tucson.
“When I first came to the school, it was dead dirt,” said Riley, an eighth-grader. “Nature can really be beautiful and not only look that way, but it also helps the world.”

Texto completo: A pulmonologist writes that hits of pure oxygen are hardly an answer. Also: Philanthropies' special obligation; addiction in the new economy.
To the Editor:
Re "An Oxygen Bar Offers a Respite From Toxic Air in India" (news article, Nov. 16):
Fifteen minutes of clear air is no solution at all to the awful problem of air pollution in India or anywhere else. The toxic particles and chemicals that are inhaled from the air in polluted cities won't be washed out by a brief hit of pure oxygen, and understandably concerned and desperate citizens shouldn't be misled into thinking otherwise.
Eighty percent of people living in urban areas breathe air that is worse than World Health Organization standards, and air pollution is the leading environmental threat to health around the globe.
Seven million people each year die from breathing polluted air. Citizens everywhere deserve transparency about air quality where they live.
Only concerted action to reduce emissions through the use of cleaner fuels, promulgation and enforcement of tighter regulations, and cooperation on a global level will solve this problem.

Charities Shouldn't Dictate
To the Editor:
Re "Philanthropists Bench the M.V.P.s," by Vanessa Daniel (Op-Ed, Nov. 20):
The New York Times Magazine's 1619 Project details how slavery became an engine for what is described as "America's low-road approach to capitalism." It should come as no surprise that the painful history that built our economy also gave rise to philanthropy and the issues articulated by Ms. Daniel.
Foundations need to realize that the wealth they distribute is not theirs to operate or control. Instead, we need to determine how to return money to communities that were exploited in creating today's economy.
In addition to funding more organizations led by people of color, philanthropy can do this by providing grantees more power to decide how resources are allocated within their organizations.
If foundations are serious about addressing inequities, they need to listen to communities and co-create solutions rather than dictate them.

Juul and the New Economy
To the Editor:
Re "How Juul Got a Generation Hooked" (front page, Nov. 24):
I was amazed to learn that Juul Labs is now worth more than the Ford Motor Company.
We once had a manufacturing economy, then a service economy and now, it seems, an addiction economy. The big winners are those who can get consumers hooked on their products (opiates, video games, e-cigarettes), never mind the personal and social costs.
For whom is this economy working, exactly?

Texto completo: The panel has been involved with impeachment proceedings against three presidents. On Wednesday, Donald Trump will be the fourth.
WASHINGTON -- Since its creation in 1813, the House Judiciary Committee has served as the backdrop to debates over the most contentious issues in American history, including a woman's right to vote, immigration and civil rights. It has either held or recommended impeachment proceedings against three presidents: Andrew Johnson, Richard M. Nixon and Bill Clinton.
Now President Trump is on that list.
On Wednesday, the judiciary panel -- 24 Democrats and 17 Republicans -- is to open the second phase of Congress's inquiry into Mr. Trump's effort to enlist Ukraine to dig up damaging information on his political rivals. Four constitutional scholars will testify on what constitutes an impeachable offense, a prelude to the panel's consideration of articles of impeachment.
Here are some key committee members to watch:
Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York and chairman of the committee
The son of a Jewish chicken farmer, Mr. Nadler has a long and not happy history with the president. The two fought bitterly in the 1980s over a real estate development Mr. Trump sought to build on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. Meticulous and thorough -- he is never seen without a stack of briefing papers -- Mr. Nadler, 72, faded from view when Representative Adam B. Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, took the reins over the Democrats' impeachment inquiry. Now it's Mr. Nadler's turn.
Doug Collins, Republican of Georgia, the ranking member
Fast-talking, ambitious and a fierce defender of the president in the Capitol and on Fox News, Mr. Collins, 53, has lately been in the news over a dispute between Mr. Trump and Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia over who should fill the Senate seat being vacated by Senator Johnny Isakson, who is retiring early. Mr. Trump wanted Mr. Kemp to appoint Mr. Collins, figuring Mr. Collins would be an attack dog during a Senate impeachment trial. Mr. Kemp appointed someone else, but Mr. Collins may seek the seat anyway.
Zoe Lofgren, Democrat of California
Ms. Lofgren has the distinction as the only committee member present for all three of the modern impeachment proceedings. In 1974, when Nixon resigned rather than face impeachment, she was a law student working on the staff of a California congressman who served on the judiciary panel. She joined the committee as a member after she was elected to Congress in 1994. Her politics are more moderate than Mr. Nadler's. The two ran against each other for the panel leadership when Democrats took the House majority this year. Mr. Nadler, who has seniority, won.
Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio
Americans who tuned into the recent Intelligence Committee impeachment hearings are already familiar with Mr. Jordan, another fierce Trump defender whose pugnacious manner and sartorial choices -- shirt and tie but never a jacket -- have drawn derision among liberals. A scrappy former wrestler and firebrand founder of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, Mr. Jordan, 55, is embroiled in controversy at home over allegations that as a young assistant wrestling coach at Ohio State University in the late 1980s and 1990s, he ignored reports that a doctor was sexually molesting team members.
Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York
The smooth-talking Mr. Jeffries, a corporate lawyer before he entered politics, is chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, which means he is responsible for developing and articulating the party's message. At 49, he is widely viewed as a rising star among the next generation of leaders whose ascent has been blocked by the two septuagenarians and one octogenarian who now hold the top three slots: Speaker Nancy Pelosi, 79, Representative Steny H. Hoyer, 80, the House majority leader, and Representative James E. Clyburn, 79, the Democratic whip.
John Ratcliffe, Republican of Texas
Mr. Ratcliffe, who also holds a spot on the Intelligence Committee, was briefly Mr. Trump's pick to succeed Dan Coats as the director of national intelligence after Mr. Coats announced his resignation in late July. But Mr. Trump abruptly dropped the plan after questions from both Democrats and Republicans about Mr. Ratcliffe's qualifications and concerns over whether he had exaggerated his résumé. Even some Republicans said he was too partisan for the job.
Jamie Raskin, Democrat of Maryland
Mr. Raskin, 56, who was a state legislator and full-time constitutional law professor at American University in Washington before his election to Congress in 2016, has established himself as a strong liberal voice on the committee. He represents a suburban Maryland district, just over the border from Washington, filled with the power lawyers and journalists Mr. Trump often derides.
Steve Chabot, Republican of Ohio
Mr. Chabot, 66, has experience as one of the Republican House managers of the impeachment of Mr. Clinton. He is one of two managers, along with Representative Jim Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, who remain on the judiciary panel. The two recently wrote an opinion article in The Wall Street Journal titled "The Clinton Impeachment Was Fair." But he is the rare Judiciary Committee member in a swing district, and could be someone to watch for evidence of any breaks in Republicans unity.
Val B. Demings, Democrat of Florida
Ms. Demings, 62, has an only-in-America story. She grew up poor in Florida, where her father worked in the orange groves and her mother was a housekeeper. She attended segregated schools and went on to become the first female chief of the Orlando Police Department, a position she held from 2007 until her retirement in 2011, after serving on the force for 27 years. The next year, she narrowly lost a race for the House, but won in 2014.
Matt Gaetz, Republican of Florida
Mr. Gaetz, a conservative with a flair for theatrics, knows how to grab the spotlight. When the Intelligence Committee began taking closed-door depositions at the outset of the impeachment inquiry, Mr. Gaetz tried to force his way in -- prompting a fiery standoff with Mr. Schiff, who insisted he was not entitled to be there. Mr. Gaetz responded by holding a news conference to protest the closed-door depositions, and led about two dozen Republicans who stormed the secure briefing room where they were taking place, bringing the proceedings to a halt for hours.
Norman Eisen, the Democrats' lawyer
Mr. Eisen, who will conduct some of the questioning for Democrats, made his name in Washington in the early 2000s as a founder of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a good governance group. He later worked as an ethics counsel to his Harvard Law School classmate, President Barack Obama, and eventually became Mr. Obama's ambassador to the Czech Republic. His mother, a Czech Holocaust survivor had been deported to Auschwitz by the Nazis, who during World War II occupied the Prague estate that later became the ambassador's residence. Mr. Eisen, who lived there, recently wrote a book about the house, "The Last Palace."

Harris ends 2020 bid

Texto completo: The Associated Press
SACRAMENTO, Calif. - Sen. Kamala Harris told supporters on Tuesday that she was ending her bid for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.
"I've taken stock and looked at this from every angle, and over the last few days have come to one of the hardest decisions of my life," the California Democrat said. "My campaign for president simply doesn't have the financial resources we need to continue."
A senior campaign aide said Harris made the decision Monday after discussing the path forward with family and other top officials over the Thanksgiving holiday.
Her abrupt withdrawal marked a dramatic fall for a candidate who showed extraordinary promise. Harris launched her campaign in front of 20,000 people on a chilly January day in Oakland, Calif. The first woman and first black attorney general and U.S. senator in California's history, she was widely viewed as a candidate poised to excite the multiracial coalition of voters that sent Barack Obama to the White House.
Her departure erodes the diversity of the Democratic field, which is dominated at the moment by a top-tier that is white and mostly male.
"She was an important voice in the race, out before others who raised less and were less electable. It's a loss not to have her voice in the race," said Aimee Allison, who leads She the People, a group that promotes women of color.
Harris ultimately could not craft a message that resonated with voters or secure the money to continue her run.
She raised an impressive $12 million in the first three months of her campaign and quickly locked down major endorsements meant to show her dominance in her home state, which offers the biggest delegate haul in the Democratic primary contest.
But as the field grew, Harris's fundraising remained flat; she was unable to attract the type of attention being showered on Pete Buttigieg by traditional donors or the grassroots firepower that drove tens of millions of dollars to Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.
In her note to supporters, Harris lamented the role of money in politics and, without naming them, took a shot at billionaires Tom Steyer and Michael Bloomberg, who are funding their presidential bids.
"I'm not a billionaire," she said. I can't fund my own campaign. And as the campaign has gone on, it's become harder and harder to raise the money we need to compete."
Harris suffered from what allies and critics viewed as an inconsistent pitch to voters. Her slogan "for the people," referenced her career as a prosecutor, a record that was viewed skeptically by the party's most progressive voters.
Through the summer, she focused on pocketbook issues and her "3a.m. agenda," a message that never seemed to resonate with voters. By the fall, she had returned to her courtroom roots with the refrain that "justice is on the ballot," both a cry for economic and social justice as well as her call that she could "prosecute the case" against a "criminal" president.
At times, she was tripped up by confusing policy positions; particularly on health care. After suggesting she would eliminate private insurance in favor of a fully government-run system, Harris eventually rolled out a health care plan that preserves a role for private insurance.
Michael Kraut, a Los Angeles defense attorney and member of Harris's finance team, said Harris suffered early on from too many people telling her what to do.
"When she is truly being who she is, she soars," he said before Harris withdrew from the race. "When she's listening to everybody talk in her ear she doesn't so much soar."
Stumbles, often of the campaign's making, continued to dog Harris into the winter, stymieing her ability to capitalize on solid moments. Harris kicked off November with a well-received speech at a massive Iowa dinner, just a day after her campaign announced it would fire staff at its Baltimore headquarters and moving some people from other early states to Iowa.
Her message was regularly overshadowed by campaign aides and allies sharing grievances with the press. Several top aides decamped for other campaigns, one leaving a blistering resignation letter.
"Because we have refused to confront our mistakes, foster an environment of critical thinking and honest feedback, or trust the expertise of talented staff, we find ourselves making the same unforced errors over and over," Kelly Mehlenbacher wrote in her letter, obtained by The New York Times. Mehlenbacher now works for businessman Bloomberg's campaign.
Harris and her aides believe she faced an uphill battle - and unfair expectations for perfection - from the start as a woman of color. Her stump speech included a line about what Harris called the "donkey in the room," a reference to the thought that Americans wouldn't elect a woman of color.
Harris often suggested it was criticism she faced in her other campaigns - all of which she won.
Her departure from the presidential race marks her first defeat as a political candidate.

Texto completo: France has designed a new tax to hit American technology companies. In response, President Trump is threatening to add new U.S. taxes on imported French wine and cheese, among other items. A better approach would be to make fun of the French government and increase U.S. imports of French people.
Noemie Bisserbe and Matthew Dalton report in the Journal from Paris:
France bristled at President Trump's plan to impose tariffs on French imports, saying the European Union stood ready to retaliate and raising the specter of a trans-Atlantic tit-for-tat.
As Mr. Trump and President Emmanuel Macron of France met on the sidelines of a North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit in London on Tuesday, the leaders tried to paper over the trade tensions, which erupted Monday evening after the Trump administration proposed levies of up to 100% on $2.4 billion of French imports.
The Trump administration proposed the tariffs... in response to France's new digital-services tax, which Mr. Trump says targets U.S. tech companies such as Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc. 's Google unit....
Rather than punishing U.S. consumers, Mr. Trump should consider spending more time belittling French policy makers. Step one is to explain why the United States creates great technology companies and France doesn't.
This column often questions the value of presidential tweeting, but it's certainly cheaper than taxing. And there's an opportunity here for some high-level trolling of an overbearing overseas bureaucracy. Mr. Trump might even encourage the government in Paris to allow France to be great again.
According to Forbes magazine, the two richest people in the world are U.S. technology entrepreneurs. And there are five more American founders of digital enterprises in the top 15. Meanwhile, the richest people in France create lovely handbags.
France produces great engineering talent. But the list of leading French technologists is difficult to compile because so many of them are now located in northern California or southern Manhattan. You'll also find them in east London.
French President Macron is well aware of his country's regulatory hostility to economic growth and specifically its failure to allow tech enterprises to grow. Liz Alderman reported last year in the New York Times:
When President Emmanuel Macron took office, he took pains to include two iPhones in his official portrait, a symbol of his penchant for technology. Millennials throng as he buzzes from one French start-up event to the next. He has wined and dined the chief executives of the world's largest tech companies, who in turn have vowed to invest billions in France.
Yet a year after Mr. Macron unveiled an aggressive agenda to turn France into "a start-up nation," it is unclear if reality has kept pace with his rhetoric. While the country has quickly become one of the most talked-about destinations in Europe for tech companies and start-ups, France still faces an uphill path in its bid to usurp London as the region's technology leader.
France's move to tax digital companies may seem like a fun way to plunder the revenues of American firms like Apple and Facebook, but it's one more reason not to try building such a company in France. As if anyone needed another one.
Mr. Trump now has a long flight home to consider memes related to Mr. Macron's pose with iphones and his new tax on their manufacturer. Surely there's some fun to be had at Mr. Macron's expense, while reminding both American and French entrepreneurs that the U.S. is a better place to do business.
A better retaliation than raising costs on U.S. consumers would be for the President to announce upon his return home that the United States is raising the number of visas available to French tech workers. Recruiting France's most talented people and allowing them to invent and live well in the U.S. is the best revenge.
Tax Foundation President Scott Hodge writes via email that the U.S. is unlikely to get satisfaction by using international organizations to challenge the French tax assault on U.S. tech firms:
The WTO is clearly an option, but those cases take forever and the Europeans have a bad track record of complying in cases in which they lose...
It is unlikely that any "solution" to the issue of how to tax digital companies that do business in a country with little physical presence in the country, will come out in favor of the US because we have the lion's share of successful digital companies. Last year, the US had a $72 billion trade surplus in digital services. Moreover, an IMF study earlier this year estimated that the US had 50% of the world's "residual profits," meaning profits above a 10% normal rate of return.
The OECD's solution to taxing digital companies is to give "market countries" (those with the customers) more taxing rights over those residual profits. This would mean reallocating more taxable profits from those successful US firms to those other countries--such as France, etc... Many companies I talk with would rather deal with these one-off [digital-services taxes] than the new rules being proposed by the OECD...
At a press conference with President Macron in London on Tuesday, Mr. Trump was asked about his latest trade spat:
Q Mr. President, what is your message to President Macron about America's tech companies? And what will your process be in determining what additional products from France you might apply tariffs to?
PRESIDENT TRUMP: Right. Well, we're working on that right now. We have discussed it. I think we'll be able to work something out, I hope. And maybe not. Maybe we'll do it through taxing. You know, we could work it out easily through taxing.
But the techs -- you know, they're American companies -- the tech companies that you're talking about. They're not my favorite people because they're not exactly for me, but that's okay. I don't care. They're American companies. And we want to tax American companies, Phil. That's important. We want to tax them. That's not for somebody else to tax them.
And, as the President knows, we taxed wine and we have other taxes scheduled. But we'd rather not do that. But that's the way it would work. So it's either going to work out, or we'll work out some mutually beneficial tax. And the tax will be substantial. And I'm not sure it's going to come to that, but it might. It might.
Before it comes to that, Mr. Trump should make the case for the competitive tax model he enacted in America in 2017.

Texto completo: What emails about Ukraine does President Trump think, or hope, will never get out?
During two interviews with FBI agents and members of Robert S. Mueller III's team last year, former White House communications director Hope Hicks recounted the president's reaction to the discovery of damning emails about the meeting his son Donald Trump Jr.; son-in-law, Jared Kushner; and campaign chairman Paul Manafort took with a Russian emissary at Trump Tower in June 2016.
'Throughout Hicks' conversations with Trump, it was clear to her that Trump did not think the emails would get out,' according to the FBI's summary of her first interview, which was released Monday night in response to an open-records lawsuit. 'Hicks' impression was Trump meant the emails would not get out to the press, but he did not say that explicitly.'
Hicks said she thought the messages would come out eventually and warned Trump that they would become a 'massive' story. She wanted 'Junior' " as the FBI summaries refer to the president's eldest son " to give an interview to a friendly media outlet, where he could take 'softball questions,' to minimize the fallout. 'The President said they should not do anything, asked why so many people had the emails, and said they needed to let the lawyers deal with it,' Hicks recalled to the FBI.
There are no fresh bombshells in these new summaries. The juiciest material appeared in Mueller's 448-page report on his investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election. But the memos about Hicks's FBI sit-downs, which occurred in March 2018, offer a revealing window into how Trump tries to control bad news. His unwillingness to rip off the Band-Aid and get out in front of bad facts has resulted in a drip, drip, drip of revelations that have clouded most of his tenure in office.
Hicks's comments are newly relevant against the backdrop of the impeachment inquiry. The White House's categorical refusal to comply with subpoenas for documents, from phone records to emails, has made it harder for investigators to corroborate sworn testimony from witnesses about the alleged campaign to coerce Ukraine's new president to announce an investigation into former vice president Joe Biden and his family in exchange for a White House meeting and nearly $400 million in military aid that had already been approved by Congress.
A confidential White House review of Trump's decision to freeze the aid turned up hundreds of documents that reveal extensive efforts to generate an after-the-fact justification for the decision and a debate over whether the delay was legal, as The Washington Post reported last week. But none of those emails have been turned over to investigators.
Trump appointees at the State, Energy and Defense departments have also defied subpoenas and refused to produce documents that get at the heart of the impeachment inquiry. They have justified doing so by making absolutist claims of presidential privilege that have led to protracted litigation in the courts. The White House is refusing to participate in the House Judiciary Committee's first impeachment hearing Wednesday.
For her part, Ivanka Trump repeatedly conducted official government business on her personal email account throughout much of 2017, sending hundreds of emails in potential violation of federal record-keeping rules. The House Oversight Committee has unsuccessfully sought to subpoena Ivanka Trump's emails.
House Democrats are quietly debating whether they should expand articles of impeachment to include charges stemming from the Mueller report, including the episode Hicks discussed with the FBI.
When the House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed Hicks to appear for a closed-door interview in June about the possible instances of obstruction of justice outlined in the Mueller report, she refused to answer any questions related to her interactions with Trump after Election Day in 2016. Citing a directive from White House lawyers, Hicks declined to answer 155 different questions from lawmakers, according to a transcript.
BuzzFeed News and CNN filed lawsuits under the Freedom of Information Act to force the release of the FBI notes, known as '302 reports,' created as part of the two-year Mueller probe. The 295-page tranche that went out Monday night is quite repetitive, and the interviews are mostly whited-out. The media outlets pledged to challenge the heavy redactions as part of the litigation to obtain records.
Hicks left the White House last year and now works at the Fox Corporation as a public relations executive. During another closed-door deposition in February 2018, while she was employed by the White House, Hicks acknowledged that she occasionally told 'white lies' for Trump. She was advised that it is a crime to lie to the FBI in the course of an investigation, which she acknowledged.
Hicks was treated like family during her time as a member of the Trump inner circle. That's how she ended up in the White House residence on the morning of June 22, 2017, with only Trump, Kushner and Ivanka Trump. 'Kushner had a manila folder with documents with him and said to the President that they had found one thing that the President should know about, but it was not a big deal,' according to Hicks's account. 'Kushner told Trump that he, Don Jr. and Paul Manafort had attended a meeting during the campaign. When he started to open the folder, Hicks said, the president stopped him and said he did not want to know about it.' Hicks believed that Kushner's folder included emails about the June 2016 meeting.
The next week, on June 28, Kushner asked Hicks and his spokesman Josh Raffel to go to the offices of someone whose name has been redacted (perhaps a lawyer) to review documents. 'Hicks was shocked by the emails concerning the meeting she and Raffel reviewed,' the FBI write-up says. 'She thought they looked really bad.'
The next day, June 29, Hicks joined Kushner, Ivanka Trump and the president in his personal dining room to discuss the emails. 'Hicks' initial reaction was that they should get in front of the emails,' according to the FBI summary. 'Kushner responded that it wasn't a big deal, just a meeting about Russian adoption. Kushner reminded the president that he had previously mentioned a meeting, and the President said he did not want to know about it.'
When Hicks said the story was going to be 'massive,' the FBI summary says, 'the President did not want to talk about it and did not want details.'
Fast-forward to July 7. Kushner and Ivanka Trump came to Hicks's hotel room in Germany to confer about how to respond to a story the New York Times was working on about the Trump Tower meeting. The next day, while they were all at the Group of 20 summit, Hicks alerted President Trump about what the Times was chasing. He told her not to comment.
Hicks and Trump talked again that day. 'The President asked what the meeting was about. Hicks told him Kushner and Junior had told her the meeting was about Russian adoption,' per the summary. 'The President said words to the effect of, 'Then just say that,' and dictated what she should say.'
When they got to Air Force One for the flight back, one of Junior's representatives texted Hicks the statement that the president's son wanted to provide to the media. 'She took that to the President's cabin and read him Junior's statement,' according to the FBI summary. 'He told her they should not respond. Hicks advocated for providing the full story. The President did not say what was wrong with Junior's statement, but just felt they were giving the media too much. . . . After meeting with Trump about Junior's statement, Hicks returned to a seat and started texting with Junior. They worked on the statement for a period and ultimately settled on the statement that went to the press.'
During that flight back to Washington, Hicks also went to Trump's cabin to tell him that then-White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus knew about the emails. There are four redacted paragraphs about what happened next.

CAPITOL JOURNAL; Harris' campaign undone by a lack of conviction

Texto completo: California Sen. Kamala Harris should never have run for president in the first place. Her ambition far exceeded her ability.
She hadn't yet established herself in the U.S. Senate. And she hadn't exactly excelled in her previous job as California's attorney general. There wasn't much of a record worth bragging about on the campaign trail.
After being elected to the Senate in a 2016 cakewalk, she should have spent the next three years focused exclusively on representing Californians in Congress, helping the state on such vital issues as water development, environmental protection, healthcare and homelessness.

But people around her -- political advisors and her sister Maya Harris -- convinced the senator she could be a female Barack Obama and be elected the first woman president. And wouldn't it be a kick to be the Democrat who brought down President Trump?
Most presidential candidates fail, she was told, but the smart ones come out ahead of where they started.
That's true in a few cases, but not in most. They just fade away. And in Harris' case, she rocketed to the top tier of candidates early, then plummeted to the ground, discarded and her campaign broke. What sort of impression will that leave? We'll find out.
She could boost herself with Democrats by helping the party take back the Senate next year, raising money and stumping for candidates.
"My campaign for president simply doesn't have the financial resources we need to continue," Harris wrote supporters and staffers Tuesday.
But Harris' lack of money was just a symptom of her failed presidential bid, not the root cause of its demise. Her downward slide in polls destroyed the confidence of potential campaign contributors in her ability to win, drying up the money flow. But the plunging poll numbers resulted from her inability to connect with voters.
And she couldn't connect with voters because of the core weakness in her candidacy: a lack of cohesive strategy and clear personal convictions. There was no evidence of the political soul needed to guide her toward public policy she felt strongly about.
"She didn't exactly have a sense of who she was and what she believed and what she wanted to get done," said a disappointed Harris insider who asked for anonymity. "And sooner or later that stuff gets exposed."
"Her strategic plan wasn't clear," the insider continued. The campaign was confident she would win the votes of African Americans in South Carolina and from fellow Californians.
When that scenario didn't seem to be working out, Harris belatedly began focusing on the first contest in Iowa. The senator was failing there, too, when she pulled the plug.
"She was all over the map on healthcare and criminal justice," the insider said of the former San Francisco district attorney. "Was she a prosecutor or a public defender? It wouldn't have made much difference which role she decided, but she started bouncing around to be all things to all people. Voters instinctively understand your heart's not in it."
Anyone who watched Harris as attorney general could have predicted this outcome. She refused to take positions on any state ballot proposition. Her excuse was that the attorney general writes the official ballot titles and summaries, and she didn't want to appear biased. But that was nonsense. She was trying to avoid making political enemies, especially among law enforcement.
Most unacceptable was her refusal to take a stand on two propositions to abolish the death penalty, a cause that she claimed to have long supported. The measures narrowly lost. She also remained neutral on an initiative to expedite the death penalty. It passed. And she didn't take a position on a measure to reduce prison sentences, which passed.
Yet, Harris leaped into the presidential race promising to be a "fighter for the people." Clearly that message was gleaned from focus groups. The rhetoric didn't match the record.
I've gone back and forth on Harris -- initially a skeptic, then impressed and back to skepticism.
Another Harris problem that was little known outside the political world is that employees reportedly found her difficult to work with.
That created a lot of staff unhappiness and it boiled over in recent weeks, creating an explosive front-page story last weekend in the New York Times.
A top Harris aide who jumped ship to another candidate left a scathing resignation letter that was leaked to the New York Times. One quote: "This is my third presidential campaign and I have never seen an organization treat its staff so poorly."
"When your staff is knife-fighting in the New York Times and Politico, your campaign is pretty much done," says Gil Duran, a former Harris staffer. "This was pretty toxic."
Duran, who was also press secretary for former Gov. Jerry Brown and U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, is now opinion editor for McClatchy newspapers in California. A week before Thanksgiving, he wrote a column urging Harris to drop out.
"The hard truth: Harris was a weak presidential candidate," Duran wrote.
Harris excelled in California politics because she's part of a home state Democratic cabal, an insiders' machine. But that machine doesn't work outside California.
Gov. Gavin Newsom and Harris are tight political siblings, sharing the same campaign consultant, Ace Smith. Now Newsom will miss an opportunity to stump for Harris in Iowa -- and plant seeds for his own presidential campaign in four or eight years.
As for Harris' candidacy, to paraphrase what Gertrude Stein wrote about the senator's hometown of Oakland: There was no there there.

Texto completo: I wanted to find out just how deeply the opioid epidemic could reach a community. So I got hold of a yearbook.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
When I first visited an Appalachian community long known as ground zero in Ohio's opioid crisis, I never expected to go back in time. I cover American youth, and my focus on that trip was on the children growing up today in families plagued by addiction.
But shortly after I arrived in Scioto County in March, I met Jake Bradshaw, a ribald, tattooed entrepreneur who spent more than two decades ensnared by drugs. A local educator had told me Mr. Bradshaw could help introduce me to families for my article, and soon he was giving me a tour of Portsmouth, the county seat, just across the Ohio River from Kentucky. As we drove through the city's gritty streets, Mr. Bradshaw began sharing his own story of opioid addiction, a downward spiral that had started when he was a high school sophomore.
Mr. Bradshaw grew up in nearby Minford, a one-stoplight town nestled amid woods and horse pastures. Back then, he said, few residents locked their doors at night and even fewer had ever heard the word overdose. As they had been for generations of Minford high schoolers before him, weekend nights were a time to hang out drinking with friends around a bonfire, or to cruise down Portsmouth's main drag in their cars -- pastimes etched deeply into teenage Americana.
But by the mid-90s, a new, darker strain of recreation was creeping into town: opioid painkillers like Percocet, Lorcet and OxyContin, which hit the market in 1996, the year Mr. Bradshaw started high school. Soon students were experimenting with pills at parties, while some, including Mr. Bradshaw, took to regularly snorting them before school, totally unaware of the opioid addictions taking over their teenage brains. "We didn't know we were doing heroin," Mr. Bradshaw said.
I kept thinking about that statement as I interviewed children in Scioto County, many of whom had addicted parents who were around Mr. Bradshaw's age. His words stuck with me as I wrote about how addiction has changed everything from how children are raised and what they learn in school to what happens when they are placed in foster care. Nearly 20 years since Mr. Bradshaw's high school graduation and 400,000 opioid overdose deaths later, his story seemed to shed light on how the crisis took root and spread over a generation. Today, it seems like everyone in Scioto County knows someone affected by addiction. Mr. Bradshaw told me that three of his former classmates and several students in the grades above and below his class had died from drug use. Many more survive. I wondered exactly how many of his classmates had been affected.
With that question in mind, I asked Mr. Bradshaw: Did he have his yearbook? A few weeks later, the leather-bound pages landed on my desk, shipped via FedEx.
I decided I would try and reach all 110 members of the Minford High School Class of 2000.
It was a long and challenging investigation. Mr. Bradshaw made numerous introductions when he could, but I quickly discovered that not everyone was so eager to share personal details about their lives, especially with a stranger asking how the opioid crisis had impacted them and their families. Many members of the class ignored my persistent Facebook messages, emails and voice mail messages. Others could not be found. When I hit a wall, The New York Times's indefatigable researchers came through with contact information for dozens more. In the final stretch, my colleague Matthew Sedacca helped me get through the list. Some of those phone numbers worked, but many were out of service. Some classmates declined to be interviewed. Most did not want to be identified.
Still, I was gratified by how many from the class were willing to share their stories on the phone and in person during another visit to Scioto County this summer. I listened as faces smiling in the yearbook spoke somberly of teenage opioid use turning into adult heroin and meth addiction. They recounted drug-induced driving accidents, stints in prison, failed attempts at recovery and the daily victory of sobriety. I heard shame and resilience, bitterness and mourning.
One classmate, who first tried OxyContin during a high school class, described how he had gone to buy drugs years later only to discover that the dealer was his long-estranged mother. He bought the drugs anyway.
A woman recalled how, after her cousin had fatally overdosed, her grandmother slapped his face at the viewing. I watched as a man who had recently been arrested using heroin paged through the yearbook in silence, heavy with regret. Another class member spoke to me while she was in rehab.
Of the nearly 50 classmates -- or their relatives -- we reached, 15 have struggled with addiction, almost a dozen have been arrested or imprisoned for drug use and 36 have family members who became addicted, some of whom died. Based on conversations I had with many of these class members, I believe that the full tally of those impacted is quite likely much higher.

Wolf asks MLB not to cut minor league ties

Texto completo: Gov. Tom Wolf is going to bat for three Pennsylvania minor league baseball teams that could lose their affiliations as Major League Baseball looks to trim the ranks of those feeder clubs.
On Monday, Wolf sent a letter to MLB Commissioner Robert Manfred and Deputy Commissioner Dan Halem urging them not to cut ties with the Erie SeaWolves, State College Spikes and Williamsport Crosscutters arguing that they're both economic engines for their communities and provide low-cost entertainment for parents and children.
"Baseball is one of America's favorite pastimes and Minor League Baseball teams have brought professional baseball and the joy of the game to many people across the country," Wolf wrote. "The result of your proposal will be detrimental to not only players and employees of teams who will lose their jobs, but to the communities these teams call home. Minor League teams support local businesses and host various forms of charitable work for their communities."
The State College and Williamsport teams play in the New York-Penn Short Season A League, and are respectively the affiliates of the St. Louis Cardinals and Philadelphia Phillies. The SeaWolves are AA affiliates of the Detroit Tigers.
Major League Baseball is currently considering whether to cut ties with 42 of its 160 minor league teams across the country, according to The New York Times. The proposal is part of an overall plan to reshape the minors and the way that up-and-coming players are developed, the newspaper reported.
According to the Times, the "newly independent teams would be welcome to join a lower-quality Dream League populated largely by undrafted and released players, a plan one minor league official called a 'death sentence.'"
Officials in the affected towns and states say they're worried about the long-term economic impact of severing those ties, as well as the survival of those teams, which bank on their major league affiliations to draw fans, hoping to get an early glimpse of future stars, to their stadiums.
Wolf raised that same concern in his letter to Manfred and Halem:
"In Pennsylvania, cutting these teams will take opportunities away from families to experience an affordable, family-friendly professional baseball game within a local setting," he wrote. Williamsport, State College, and Erie are each located several hours from a Major League stadium, so losing the local Minor League team would make attending baseball games difficult for families who live in these places.
"Children and young adults in these communities, including Williamsport, the home of the Little League World Series, would lose invaluable opportunities to watch and learn from talented Minor League players," Wolf continued. "If these teams are cut, it also creates another issue for local authorities in regard to possibly having an empty stadium to maintain. Minor League Baseball teams promote talent development, encourage fan loyalty, and most importantly, bring communities together."

Texto completo: Rigor could be restored to mainstream climate journalism with a single clause. That clause consists of the words "if climate models are accurate."
A United Nations study issued in advance of this week's climate summit in Madrid would appear in a different light, though still worrisome, and still a challenge to policy makers, if it were reported as saying: To avoid any chance of a temperature increase of 1.5 degrees Celsius, annual emissions cuts of 7.6% must begin next year if computerized climate simulations are correct.
Such simulations, we should admit, are science. Their findings represent a legitimate pursuit of knowledge. The common failing in the media involves leaving out the necessary caveats. Such carelessness has ultimately enabled a new kind of science denial on the left, where advocates like Greta Thunberg and the U.K. group Extinction Rebellion increasingly talk about climate change leading to a human demise that is nowhere supported in the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change or other scientific bodies.
In my view, Al Gore bears heavy responsibility here. Name any important policy commitment in history—whether Social Security or Medicare or even fighting World War II—that required that all debate be silenced and all skeptics vilified before it could proceed. The Gore formula is good for stoking tribalism. It's not good for making policy progress in a democracy. And so it has proved. Nobody remotely believes the supposedly necessary emissions cuts will take place. The only response left to the climate crowd is to ratchet up even more dire predictions.
Let's start over. If stated properly, the "scientific consensus" would run as follows: climate models teach us to expect some warming from human-caused atmospheric CO2 increases, but disagree about how much. It's hard to make cost-benefit judgments on such a basis, but happily the Green New Deal makes it easy—it would cost a lot of money and accomplish nothing since U.S. emissions are just 14% of the total and shrinking. India and China, not the U.S., will determine the fate of climate change.
Cost-benefit analysis also tells us a bunch of things that might be worth doing even in light of the uncertainties. A tax reform based on a revenue-neutral carbon tax could make our tax system more efficient and pro-growth. Government investment in basic research tends to have a high payoff, and battery research is a particularly attractive opportunity. Rethinking nuclear power and regulation is another area of huge potential. Safer and cheaper nuclear technologies continue to advance on the drawing board even in today's inhospitable political environment.
And guess what? All the above would be easier to sell to other countries than Green New Deal masochism. Voters would readily gobble up new energy technologies and tax models that would make their societies richer and stronger.
In honor of this week's global climate gathering in Madrid, the New York Times aptly refers to the "gap between reality and diplomacy." International agreements, by their nature, are designed to put an imprimatur on what domestic politicians would do anyway, and that doesn't include prematurely ending their careers by imposing on consumers the kind of crushing burdens the green left seeks.
Look elsewhere for the turning points that actually matter. If climate change proves as severe as some scientists believe, the most damning moment will be one that passed largely unremarked except in this column : the Fukushima nuclear reactor meltdown after Japan's 2011 earthquake and tsunami. Under Chancellor Angela Merkel, Germany, the world's sixth biggest emitter, chaotically and thoughtlessly announced within weeks that it would close all 17 of its nuclear plants. China and India, then pursuing ambitious nuclear expansions that should have become more ambitious, instead recommitted themselves to burning vast amounts of coal.
Nuclearphobes should remind themselves that more people die each year from coal-mining accidents than have been killed in all the nuclear accidents in history. Never mind the tens of thousands who are statistically estimated to die annually from inhaling particulates. No technology is perfect, but NASA's James Hansen, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, Gaia theorist James Lovelock, and the late Harvard economist Martin Weitzman are among the diverse and serious students of climate change who have said that meaningful cuts won't happen without nuclear.
The Fukushima accident, widely misread and breathing new life into the antinuclear lobby, will prove more significant than even the advocacy errors of Al Gore. It will prove more significant than the Paris Agreement, the election of Donald Trump, the tiresome legal vendetta against Exxon, or any of the matters that obsess the climate left. It probably put paid to any hope that emissions cuts will play a role in climate change for at least the next three or four decades. Get used to it.

A ghost of a story

Texto completo: Martha Taylor, the official Henniker town historian, believes ghosts may exist.

Not this ghost, though. Not the ghost named Mary Wallace – once connected to her hometown – despite visual evidence to the contrary, shown on a recent documentary on the Travel Channel.
“I believe in the possibility of ghosts, but the show was made for entertainment purposes, and I think I had to be there to see what really happened,” Taylor told me by phone the day after the show.
Mary, the story went, haunted a house in Henniker, before a team of ghost-hunters – the stars in that recently shown documentary – eventually discovered that Mary has been haunting a house in Rhode Island, not in Henniker.
The Rhode Island house originated in Londonderry, once Mary's childhood home in the 18th century, and it was dismantled and moved to the Ocean State, year unknown, reason unknown. Mary never lived in Rhode Island, having passed away long before the move, and her ties to Henniker were deemed strong enough to send a crew here for a new show, The Holzer Files, and its segment on Mary, “Legends and Lies.”
Mary, buried in the cemetery behind the Henniker Town Hall, died in 1814 at the age of 94. She fooled paranormalist Hans Holzer, who was famous enough to earn a staff-written obit in the New York Times 10 years ago.
He visited the Henniker house in the 1960s, looking for clues, and came away unfulfilled, not realizing at the time that he was searching in the wrong place.
And that's not simply because Mary had more interest in haunting her childhood home, the one that landed in Rhode Island. It's because the Henniker house under the microscope when Holzer rode into town once belonged to Mary's son, Robert, whom she never lived with.
Instead, Mary moved in with another son, William, after her husband died, and William lived on the same street, Bear Hill Road, as Robert.
Taylor and other longtime residents have long known the real story, that Mary never lived in the Henniker house that's supposedly haunted; and that some guy nicknamed Gussie moved into that house and ran with the story, charging admission to the gullible, convincing them that he lived at the epicenter of the supernatural; and that Mary really lived her later years in another house in Henniker, also on Bear Hill.
Those factors contributed to Taylor's skepticism before she'd even seen the film, shown on Nov. 21.
“Not buying into it,” she said then.
I'd seen an advanced copy, sent to me earlier in the week. I'd wait for Taylor to watch for herself. Then seek comment. Perhaps she'd be convinced that Mary has been floating around in Rhode Island for decades, maybe centuries.
I'd see what she thought about the mysterious snow-white footprints and an unexplained voice, caught on tape, in the Rhode Island home, featured in the second half of the documentary.
But the next morning, Taylor remained unconvinced.
“I think I had to be there to see what happened,” she said. “You can only do so much on TV to prove it. I have great doubts about what they found.”
This is a complex tale of twists and turns, following the trail of ghostly breadcrumbs that Mary dropped so long ago. She was born on a ship sailing from Ireland to the United States in 1720, leading to her longtime nickname, Ocean-Born Mary. Pirates boarded the ship. Mean pirates.
But baby Mary caught a break when the captain of the pirates offered her mother a deal: Name your baby after the captain's mother, or die.
Simple enough. Mary named her baby after the captain's mother. She grew up in Londonderry, married there, had children there. Then her husband died and three of their sons moved to Henniker, building separate houses.
Mary moved in with William, whose house should have been the famous one, because that's where Mary lived the last 16 years of her life.
But when a photographer named Louis Maurice Augustus Roy – nicknamed Gussie – moved into Robert's house in 1917, dollar signs appeared in his eyes.
Gussie knew about the legend of Ocean-Born Mary and built his business, steeped in deception. He spread the word, falsely saying that Mary had died in his house, that the pirate had come to visit her there and that he buried his treasure there as well.
For a fee, you could come inside, listen to the noises, watch the rocking chair rock, feel the fear. He rented out shovels to his customers and let them dig for the captain's treasure until the cows came home.
“He was a showman,” Taylor said. “He promoted his ghost story and expanded the whole story.”
Facts blurred. Legends grew. Roy made money.
He also, according to some, confessed on his death bed in 1960 that he had made the whole thing up. And when Taylor moved to Henniker in the early '90s, she soon got into the spirit of the climate there.
“Libraries from out of state came to see it,” Taylor said. “Groups of children came as part of a field trip.”
Back to Holzer, who died 10 years ago at age 89. He went to the house in the 1960s, and his interviews from those visits can be heard in the documentary. Holzer never completed his work in Henniker, never felt satisfied that he had uncovered the whole truth.
The Travel Channel's ghost-finders – led by lead investigator Dave Schrader – began snooping last spring, with Holzer's daughter joining the team.
They learned the details, the real details, Schrader says, that Mary and the pirate did not have a fling, as was thought, and Gussie had exploited the wrong house. They also buried the idea that treasure was hiding.
The other Henniker house, Mary's house, might have been a good place to look, but it burned down in the 1920s and was never rebuilt.
So they went to Rhode Island. To the old Londonderry house.
“That's where Mary found solace, in that house,” said Schrader.
He's the face out front, answering questions about his credibility.
He and his team of four set up walkie-talkie-looking things that, Schrader said, would beep when something unseen passed. It beeped.
They spoke to the woman living there now – the human woman – who said Mary had begun to make her presence felt recently. They shot video and saw footprints, bright white. We don't see how the prints were made, but we see them.
And on a recording, after Mary was asked if she was in the room at that very moment, you hear “Yes,” spoken in a creepy, gravelly whisper. Did she bring the valuable jewelry, found hidden in the house?
“No.”
Her third and final word was “Lies,” proof, Schrader says, that the untold story, the one with so many elements falsely passed down through the years, had caused Mary's restlessness.
Maybe she could rest in peace now.
Seriously, Dave?
He swore by it, telling me there was no trickery involved. Nothing. Nada. Zilch.
“We don't do that,” Schrader said.
He cited his professional background, in radio for 13 years, a published author. “I would not put myself into the cross-hairs of something that will use fake evidence and while I'm honoring the name of Hans Holzer,” Schrader said. “That place was amazing.”
Schrader knew ​​​​​​what ​Taylor and Kristin MacLean, the president of the Henniker Historical Society, were thinking last spring, when the production team came to visit.
“They were completely skeptical,” Schrader said, “because they knew the original story wasn't true.”
Not even creepy voices and footprints, however, could change Taylor's mind. She's like a lot of people. She needs to see this ghostly stuff for herself. No TV show. No scripts.
Personal, visual contact, or bust.
“If they didn't find the ghost they were looking for, maybe there's no show,” Taylor said. “To sell it to the Travel Channel, they had to have something to show.
“How do I know they didn't cut and paste?”

Texto completo: Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins are getting real about their feelings.
The stars opened up about everything from crying to alcohol to moving on from mistakes, in a conversation published by Interview magazine Monday.
At one point during their conversation, the two got personal about their emotions, with Pitt revealing he hasn't been one to cry easily.
"I am quite famously a not-crier," Pitt, 55, said. "Is that a term? I hadn’t cried in, like, 20 years, and now I find myself, at this latter stage, much more moved — moved by my kids, moved by friends, moved by the news. Just moved. I think it’s a good sign. I don’t know where it’s going, but I think it’s a good sign. "
Hopkins, 81, said he cries "at the drop of a hat, because everything moves me. "
"You’ll find, as you get older, that you just want to weep," he added "It’s not even about grief. It’s about the glory of life. "
The stars also discussed their struggles with alcohol. Pitt recalled how Hopkins told him he'd "dumped" the substance while they were filming 1998's "Meet Joe Black. " In September, Pitt opened up to The New York Times about quitting drinking and attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.
Brad Pitt talks sobriety, Alcoholics Anonymous: 'I removed my drinking privileges'
"I look at it, and I think, 'What a great blessing that was, because it was painful,' " Hopkins said. "I did some bad things. But it was all for a reason, in a way. And it’s strange to look back and think, 'God, I did all those things?' But it's like there's an inner voice that says, 'It's over. Done. Move on. ' "
Pitt agreed with Hopkins' attitude of "embracing" mistakes, something the "Ad Astra" actor says society does not do enough.
Review: 'The Two Popes' engages with a tale of pontiffs and pizza, not preachiness
"I think we’re living in a time where we’re extremely judgmental and quick to treat people as disposable," Pitt added. "We’ve always placed great importance on the mistake. But the next move, what you do after the mistake, is what really defines a person. We’re all going to make mistakes. But what is that next step? We don’t, as a culture, seem to stick around to see what that person’s next step is. And that’s the part I find so much more invigorating and interesting. "

Gronkowski Won't Return for Patriots' Playoff Run

Texto completo: The retired tight end did not meet the N.F.L.'s deadline to be reinstated.
Rob Gronkowski really is retired, at least for this season.
The former New England Patriots tight end had dangled the possibility of returning to the N.F.L. almost as soon as he announced his retirement in March, a month after he helped the Patriots beat the Los Angeles Rams in Super Bowl LIII.
Despite a long list of injuries during his nine-year career, all spent with New England, Gronkowski said in October that he loved football and would keep the door open to playing again someday. The Patriots, too, were welcoming.
The team's owner, Robert K. Kraft, reportedly told Gronkowski after the retirement announcement that he wanted the tight end back in time for this year's playoffs. For that to happen, Gronkowski needed to file paperwork before Week 13 of the season so that he could be taken off the team's reserve list, but he missed the Nov. 30 deadline.
The Patriots (10-2) are tied for the A.F.C.'s best record but have struggled with a thin receiving corps this season. The team released the former Pro Bowl receiver Antonio Brown in September and the veteran Josh Gordon in October. For many years, Gronkowski was one of quarterback Tom Brady's favorite targets.
If Gronkowski, 30, still wants to make a comeback, he will have to wait until the 2020 season, at the earliest. Dallas Cowboys tight end Jason Witten took a similar route, retiring before the 2018 season and then returning to play for the team this year after working as an ESPN analyst.
Since leaving the Patriots, Gronkowski has remained in the limelight. Among other pursuits, he became a football analyst for Fox Sports and a pitchman for a company that produces a line of cannabidiol-infused topical pain relievers. In an interview with The New York Times in August, he did not rule out a cameo in World Wrestling Entertainment or an appearance on "Dancing With the Stars." He said he had lost about 20 pounds since retiring, and was focused on improving his health.
"I have nothing against drinking, and I believe that there's times for celebration -- 100 percent -- after good days of hard work, or you win a championship," he said. "But I've definitely cut hugely back on that, which I knew I needed to. I'm still really figuring out how bad it was to do it the way I was doing it. I took the hard route to find that."

SESTAK QUITS HIS RUN FOR PRESIDENCY

Texto completo: After about five months of campaigning in which he failed to register half a percent in national polling, former Pennsylvania congressman Joe Sestak dropped from the race for the presidency Sunday.
In a message posted to his Twitter, Mr. Sestak wrote that it would be unfair to ask others to sacrifice their resources to his campaign without having "the privilege of national press."
Mr. Sestak, a retired Navy admiral, wrote that there is a "tear in the fabric" of America right now, "but it can be repaired by someone who can lead, and therefore unite, all Americans."
He did not endorse a candidate in his announcement.
Mr. Sestak, who served two terms in the House before losing a pair of general elections to Republican Pat Toomey for a Senate seat, was polling at an average of 0.3% and didn't register a percentage in last week's Quinnipiac University poll.
His departure from the race leaves 17 Democratic candidates pursuing the nomination.
Mr. Sestak, 67, a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy who spent three decades in the Navy, served two terms in the House, 2007-2011. In joining the crowded field last June, Mr. Sestak called for strong action to deal with climate change, corporate accountability and China's geopolitical threat.
Among the centerpieces of the Democrat's platform were a job training guarantee for employees displaced by technological advances and outsourcing, and a system of public hospitals in underserved areas.
Mr. Sestak recently completed a walk across New Hampshire to drum up interest in his campaign.
It was a tactic he had tried before, in 2015, when he walked across Pennsylvania to open a second campaign for the Senate.
It did not work then, either.
The Democratic Party remained rankled over Mr. Sestak's campaign in 2010 to challenge Sen. Arlen Specter in the Democratic primary. In 2016, Mr. Sestak's go-it-alone style continued to earn him the ire of many national and state Democrats.
The Associated Press, The New York Times and The Washington Post contributed.

Texto completo: For, Ellen Barry, it was supposed to be a short-term project. But a family of deposed aristocrats living in isolation proved intriguing.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
The mysterious man living in a ruined palace in a forest in the middle of India's capital city first contacted Ellen Barry, a correspondent for The New York Times, over four years ago.
"He was elfin and wore high-waisted mom jeans," Ms. Barry, wrote in "The Jungle Prince of Delhi," the article she recently published on the man and his family.
He called himself Prince Cyrus, and said he was a member of the fallen House of Oudh, royals of a Muslim kingdom captured by the British East India company in the 19th century. For a time, after the partition of British India in 1947, Prince Cyrus lived with his mother, Wilayat, and sister, Princess Sakina, in an old hunting lodge in a jungle thicket inside Delhi. The family's story tugged at the curiosity of locals and journalists for decades. And, every so often, the family would grant an interview to a foreign reporter.
At first, Ms. Barry, the former South Asia bureau chief for The Times, expected a short-term project, but as the story was delayed, she became more intrigued and drilled into the family's background.
And, after following the story for years, she discovered that the family were not who they claimed: Before Partition, they had lived an ordinary life under different names. (Prince Cyrus's real name was Mickey Butt.) Ms. Barry reflected on her reporting in this interview, which has been lightly edited and condensed.
You had read various newspaper accounts about the royal family of Oudh over the years. What made you feel like there was still more to tell?
I suppose the great mystery is why a family with those resources and background would live in those conditions. It was difficult to make sense of that.
How much time did you spend with Prince Cyrus?
Over a period of a year and a half, I probably went to see him seven or eight times. When I left [India to start a new job in London], I brought a colleague who I thought could continue to visit him after I was gone.
What were those meetings like?
When you are speaking to someone for a story, some percentage of the time is spent doing things other than trying to get information. So, we talked about the past. We talked about food. We talked about his aspirations. He talked about his paranoia, and I talked about what was going on in my personal life. It's like what you talk about when you go visit an elderly relative.
How is reporting a story like this different from covering a news story like Brexit, as you have recently?
I think reporting is always about building trust and building relationships and trying to confirm facts. It's always the same.
What really blew your mind in the process of reporting this story?
It surprised me that they had first-degree relatives who had perfectly normal, comfortable, ordinary lives.
What do you encourage readers to think about as they're reading?
I think that there's an enormous amount of dislocation and trauma from that period in Indian history that hasn't been fully told.
This was an extraordinary family. They led an extraordinary life, and they made a big mark on the city they lived in. What I hope is that it leads to some kind of permanent record of their existence. There's beautiful photographic work that has been done around this family for many years. I also think that it's possible to find Prince Cyrus's grave and mark it.
How would you describe the reaction to the story?
One thing that I was hoping would happen, and is happening, is that people are coming forward with their recollections of the family, and new information is coming out. I've been contacted by people who knew them in Kashmir, where they lived for some period, and from people who interacted with them when they lived in the forest. I feel like the account that I was able to put together will be flushed out as time goes on.
How do you verify your reporting, for people who aren't familiar with the process?
You basically try to speak to as many family members as possible to see if you can confirm independent accounts. You look for records and documents. In this case, I'm sure there are documents, but the period around Partition was a chaotic one. It was difficult to find documents other than newspaper articles in this case. But there were a lot of newspaper articles.
You were working in India for four years. How did the time you spent in that region help shape this story?
It is just a very storytelling culture. I lived in Russia for a long time and people gobbled up Bollywood throughout the Soviet period because of the nature of the stories. It was always a scrappy hero who came from behind to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. That's part of life there and part of the life of the city that I lived in and loved for four years.
You recently returned to the United States to work as the New England bureau chief. What is it like to come back to America now?
It's great. I really just started the new job, but writing about America is a treat. This is probably the most interesting place in the world right now.

Texto completo: A reader discusses the environmental risks posed by wood-burning ovens. Also: Term limits; a bad education bill; wealth inequality; foster care and bias.
To the Editor:
Re "Canadian Bagel Rivals Unite Against Environmentalists" (Montreal Dispatch, Nov. 27):
The story of two rival bagel makers in Montreal who have joined forces to oppose the demands of "anti-bagel radicals" -- those local residents and policymakers who want to ban their wood-burning ovens because of the environmental risks they pose -- sounds like something straight out of an episode of "Curb Your Enthusiasm" or "Seinfeld." But it's no laughing matter.
While wood-burning ovens help make Montreal bagels the best in the world (sorry, New York), the scientific consensus is demonstrably clear: Wood smoke, whether from an industrial oven or a home fireplace, is a major health hazard and contributor to urban air pollution.
Because of this unhappy truth, I now know what it must feel like for religious people to be told that their cherished beliefs collide with reality. The alternative -- in this case, making Montreal bagels in non-wood-burning ovens -- is sacrilege.

Lesson From the Hearings: We Need Term Limits
To the Editor:
Re "Lessons of the Trump Inquiry," by Susan E. Rice (Op-Ed, Nov. 23):
The No. 1 lesson from the Trump inquiry is that there must be term limits for our legislative branch. How many of us would willingly give up a potential lifetime position with a solid salary, amazing benefits, plenty of time off as well as some genuine celebrity, in order to do the right thing? Not many. That's realistic and it's human.
Never before has it been so apparent that term limits are an essential component of our democracy. Holding onto that job will almost always "trump" standing up for principle. This time it's the Republicans; next time it could be the Democrats.

The Flaw in a Higher Education Bill
To the Editor:
Re "In Back Rooms, College Inc. Clamors for Access to Cash," by Kevin Carey (Business, Nov. 16):
Mr. Carey misses the point in his attack on higher education associations and accreditors in stating his support for a proposal in a House higher education reauthorization bill that requires accreditors to establish minimum benchmarks.
The issue is not that accreditors need to have benchmarks, nor is it that we think that student outcomes are not important. Accreditors should have meaningful benchmarks. The issue is that under this legislation the secretary of education gets to approve them.
This would put academic control of every college and university in the country in the hands of politically appointed federal officials.
That is not a power we believe any secretary of education, Democratic or Republican, should possess.

Fixing the Political Imbalance
To the Editor:
Re "Bill Gates, I Implore You to Connect Some Dots" (Op-Ed, nytimes.com, Nov. 11):
Michael Tomasky is right that extreme wealth inequality necessarily threatens democracy. To his fear that inequality fuels demagogy should be added another concern: A society with an oligarchic concentration of wealth is likely to function as a political oligarchy as well.
Fueled by the Supreme Court's horrendous decision in Citizens United a decade ago, the superrich now decisively dominate election financing. The top 100 donors are responsible for nearly three-quarters of funding for super PACs, the most important political committees in the post-Citizens United era.
The outsize role of the superrich affects who runs for office, who wins and what policy options are considered "reasonable." Political and economic inequality fuel each other, and together are doing severe damage to our country and our planet.
Reforms aiming to de-concentrate wealth necessarily should also include political reform, including a system of public and small-donor financing of elections (included in the transformative H.R. 1, the For the People Act) and a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United.

L.G.B.T.Q. People and Foster Care
To the Editor:
Re "Proposed Rule Could Deny L.G.B.T. People an Adoption" (news article, Nov. 3):
As an adoptive parent in a same-sex marriage, I'm proud that New York has been one of the most progressive states on this issue. We cannot afford to go backward when there are thousands of children in foster care in our state.
Anyone who believes that L.G.B.T.Q. people cannot provide a healthy home environment for a child is not only being discriminatory, but is also advocating against the best interests of children and sending a damaging message to youth who identify as L.G.B.T.Q. and who are disproportionately represented in the child welfare system.
Child welfare organizations should never place their personal or religious beliefs above the needs of children in their care. J.C.C.A., the child welfare organization I lead (formerly known as the Jewish Child Care Association), is a historically Jewish organization, and our values are firmly grounded in the Jewish tradition. These guide our understanding that children need loving and nurturing families of all faiths, combinations and backgrounds.
It is fair to restrict taxpayer funding for agencies that choose to discriminate against particular groups. After all, that funding comes from taxpayers from all walks of life.

Texto completo: As head of the Elias Sports Bureau, which he took over in 1952, he supervised record-keeping for baseball, football and other professional sports.
Seymour Siwoff, who brought statistical analysis to the sports world, chronicling feats from the epic to the arcane through seven decades as the head of the Elias Sports Bureau, died on Friday at his home in Manhattan. He was 99.
His death was confirmed by his grandson Joe Gilston, whose Joseph Gilston Trust took over Elias in March, purchasing 100 percent of its stock.
Until then, Mr. Siwoff had since 1952 been the president and chief executive of Elias, the official record-keeper for America's major professional sports leagues. In recent years the bureau's day-to-day operations had been overseen by Steve Hirdt, the executive director, but Mr. Siwoff remained a presence in its Manhattan office until just a few months ago.
When Mr. Siwoff took control of Elias, it was tallying basic baseball records for newspapers and wire services. At the time, the Brooklyn Dodgers were evidently the only team with its own statistician, Allan Roth, who tracked the performances of the Dodgers' players.
Sports statistics were still relatively primitive, and record-keeping, long before the computer age, was a laborious task. Managers, coaches and front-office executives were armed with only modest information for plotting strategy and making trades. The correct answer to many a barroom trivia argument might remain unclear long after closing time.
That began to change when Mr. Siwoff purchased the Al Munroe Elias Baseball Bureau from the widows of Al and Walter Elias, who founded it in 1913.
Mr. Siwoff (pronounced SEA-woff) had worked part time for Elias in 1939, when he was a freshman at St. John's University in Queens. After serving in the Army in World War II -- he was wounded in the Italian campaign -- he obtained an accounting degree from St. John's, then returned to Elias, where he melded his professional training with his interest in sports.
Mr. Siwoff renamed the company the Elias Sports Bureau, reflecting his ambition to range through the entire sports world.
Elias eventually became the record-keeper for Major League Baseball, the National Football League, the National Basketball Association, the National Hockey League, the Women's National Basketball Association and Major League Soccer. It also provides national and local sports broadcasting outlets and sports websites with data and content drawing on its archives; among its offerings are short "Elias Says" items for ESPN's website.
By the 1970s, Elias was relying on computers to unearth data and indicate what it all might mean in anticipating players' performances.
Through its computer programming, Elias has also provided teams and news media outlets with bits of history within minutes of an odd or spectacular moment on the field, revealing whether anything like it had happened before.
"Statistics can be cold and trivial," Mr. Siwoff was quoted as having said in the 1970s in "The Numbers Game: Baseball's Lifelong Fascination With Statistics" (2004), by Alan Schwarz, a former reporter for The New York Times. "But they can also be alive and full of drama."
"What I enjoy most about statistics is the chance they give you to relive the past," Mr. Siwoff said. "When Nate Colbert drives in 13 runs in a doubleheader, it gives you a chance to recall when Jim Bottomley drove in 12 in a game." (Colbert set his record with the San Diego Padres in 1972; Bottomley achieved his with the St. Louis Cardinals in 1924.)
"In looking up things like that, I can see these guys in my mind as clearly as if they were playing again," Mr. Siwoff said.
Mr. Siwoff assembled a staff, which presided over computers and old record books and scrapbooks, on an upper floor of an office building at Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street in Manhattan, overlooking the New York Public Library.
"We've got more information on sports up here in our office than they do down there," he once said.
Elias has over the years been joined by a growing field of statistical compilers and analysts. But it retains its standing as the official statistician for many leagues.
Seymour Siwoff was born on Nov. 9, 1920, in Brooklyn to Jack and Ida Siwoff and grew up in the Brighton Beach section. His father made women's shoes.
In his early years at Elias, Mr. Siwoff delivered updated statistics for the major leagues' batting and pitching leaders to New York newspapers and wire services like The Associated Press after the bureau combed through daily box scores.
Long after his data was computerized, Mr. Siwoff retained something of an old-time aura.
"His slight, angular frame is covered by conservatively cut business suits," The Hartford Courant reported in 2004. "He always wears a tie and leather shoes with laces, of course, even in the summer. In the winter months comes the overcoat and fedora. His reed-thin mustache is right out of Ronald Colman or William Powell."
In 1975 Mr. Siwoff began publishing The Player Analysis, printouts weighing some 40 pounds, for about a half-dozen major league baseball teams. The teams paid Elias to assess each of their players' performances in a host of situations.
From 1985 to 1993, Elias put out a successor publication, the annual Elias Baseball Analyst, which was sold to the public. It has long issued The Elias Book of Baseball Records, an annual publication also available for purchase.
In addition to Mr. Gilston, Mr. Siwoff is survived by a son, Ronald; a daughter, Nancy Gilston; three other grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren. His sister Lela Swift, a pioneering female director whose career went back to television's early years, died in 2015 at 96.
Elias considers its data proprietary, designed for use by its customers. It doesn't invite phone calls seeking a definitive answer to barroom arguments.
When asked his age by reporters as the years went by, Mr. Siwoff had a standard retort. As he put it to The Buffalo News in a 2008 interview, "That's the question I never answer."

Texto completo: Overlooking the tragic lessons of the region's dictatorial past, politicians are turning again to the armed forces to resolve crises.
At first glance, the fall of Bolivia's president, Evo Morales, this month may appear to be a victory for democracy. After all, his populist government had grown increasingly undemocratic. Having already served three terms, Mr. Morales called a referendum in 2016 seeking to eliminate the Constitution's term limits. When Bolivians voted the proposal down, the Constitutional Court, packed with Morales loyalists, allowed him to run anyway -- on the absurd ground that term limits violated his "human right" to run for office.
In October, Mr. Morales "won" a fourth term in an election that an Organization of American States report says was marred by vote tampering. Widespread protest and a police mutiny erupted, opposition leaders called on the armed forces to dislodge Mr. Morales and army leaders "suggested" that he resign. Mr. Morales fled to Mexico, and an opposition senator, Jeanine Áñez, assumed the presidency. In effect, Mr. Morales fell prey to a coup.
Many Bolivians sought Mr. Morales's departure. But he quit only after the police rebelled and the army chief called for his resignation -- a call made after he had conceded to new elections under new electoral authorities, which offered a plausible way out of the crisis without military intervention.
The coup highlights an alarming development in Latin America: Ignoring the tragic lessons of the region's praetorian past, many politicians are turning to the armed forces to resolve crises and even remove governments.
In Ecuador in 2000, Venezuela in 2002, Honduras in 2009, and now in Bolivia, opposition groups applauded when the army stepped in to remove elected governments they viewed as inept, corrupt or a threat to democratic institutions. Military intervention, they declared, was a means of defending democracy.
Such views are misguided. Military coups rarely lead to democratic transitions; when they do, it's mostly in cases when the target is an established dictator, as in Venezuela in 1958, the Philippines in 1986 and Paraguay in 1989. Coups against elected governments -- even populist ones with authoritarian tendencies -- almost always push countries in a less democratic direction.
For a coup to bring democracy, interim governments must exercise extraordinary restraint. Unelected and without a popular mandate, they must limit themselves to forging a consensus around democratic rules of the game and overseeing clean elections.
Yet anti-populist coups rarely produce such restraint. Having come to power in a polarized environment, with many supporters driven by intense anger and animosity toward the former government, interim leaders are often tempted to engage in partisan revanchism: They indulge in policy reversals, purge the bureaucracy of the former government's supporters, prosecute former officials and their allies.
Such measures almost invariably prompt a new round of polarization and conflict. Supporters of the previous government tend to close ranks, radicalize and mobilize against the new government, which, in turn, brings repression. This spiral of mobilization and violence tends to strengthen the hand of government hard-liners who call for the jailing, exile and even banning of the populists in a retreat into authoritarianism.
This is what happened in Argentina after the overthrow of Juan Perón in 1955. Peron's support for unions and generous social welfare policies won him the support of the Argentine working class. Yet he governed in a polarizing and autocratic manner, generating fierce opposition from the middle class, the wealthy and sectors of the military.
After Perón's ouster, many believed Argentina would return to democracy. These hopes were soon dashed, however, as the new military government attempted to eradicate Peronism from Argentine society. Perón was exiled, his supporters were persecuted, and his party, the country's largest, was banned. Even uttering his name became a criminal offense. The effort to eradicate Peronism brought nearly three decades of instability, including three more coups and two periods of military dictatorship.
More recently, an anti-populist coup in Thailand proved similarly destructive of democratic institutions. The military's removal of Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra in 2006 polarized Thai society. And when the army responded to heightened conflict by attempting to destroy Mr. Thaksin's political movement, it destroyed Thai democracy.
There are signs that Bolivia may be embarking on a similar path. Like Argentina in 1955, Bolivia's interim administration has been revanchist. The new cabinet is dominated by religious conservatives from the eastern lowlands who are bitterly opposed to Mr. Morales's secular and indigenous-based Movement Toward Socialism party. Instead of prioritizing elections and negotiating democratic rules of the game with Mr. Morales's party, which remains Bolivia's largest, the new officials declared their intention to "hunt down" and prosecute party leaders and their allies.
Predictably, this generated protest, which was met with repression. Using language reminiscent of the 1970s, South America's most repressive decade, supporters of the new government have described the Movement Toward Socialism as a "cancer," while government officials threatened to prosecute opponents for sedition and claimed to possess lists of subversive journalists. Most ominously, President Áñez granted the security forces immunity from criminal prosecution for acts undertaken while maintaining public order -- in effect, carte blanche for the military to engage in lethal repression.
The next day, military and police forces fired on protesters in Cochabamba, killing nine and wounding more than 100 others. Although internationally mediated negotiations and new elections offer a possible way out of the crisis, the spiral of mobilization and violence -- at least 32 deaths have been reported -- has generated fear that Bolivia is moving toward a low-intensity civil war.
There is another, more basic, reason to resist the temptation to call on the military to resolve crises: Military intervention undermines the development of democratic institutions.
Most of Latin America was plagued by military interference for the first 150 years of independence. Military officers directly seized power, removed or installed governments, or threatened to do so to exert power behind the scenes.
Armies established themselves as the ultimate arbiters during crises, with deleterious consequences for democracy. Rather than relying on elections and the rule of the law to resolve conflicts, politicians often turned to the military. Research shows that each intervention reinforces the norm that the army can (and maybe should) intervene in politics, which makes future interventions more likely. The result, in many countries, was decades of instability and military rule. Bolivia, for example, experienced 13 coups, more than one every five years, between 1920 and 1980.
Establishing a civilian rule is a long and difficult process. Each time military officials step in to resolve a crisis, no matter how benign or even democratic their motives may appear to be, the process of institutionalizing civilian control is undermined. Only recently has Latin America began to break out of this vicious cycle. After 1980, the number of coups declined significantly. At least partly as a result, the last three decades have been the most democratic in Latin American history. The renewed willingness to accept and even seek out military intervention is deeply troubling.
The political scientist Alfred Stepan, an expert on Latin American militaries, wrote during the 1980s that the key to preserving the region's new democracies lay in ensuring that no civilian group knocked on the barracks door. In other words, politicians from across the political spectrum must agree that under no circumstance will they seek out or support a coup. Without civilian allies, militaries rarely intervene. These lessons are especially important today as Latin America enters a period of heightened polarization and unrest.
The lessons extend to the international community. If foreign governments choose sides in the region's conflicts, tolerating coups that favor their ideological allies rather than consistently defending democracy, it will encourage a return to the violence and instability that Latin Americans struggled so hard to end.

No shortage of musical Advent performances this holiday season

Texto completo: Frosted pines at the Royal Hawaiian, each branch heavy with ornaments. Surfer Santas gliding in on beaches from Hanalei to Kamakahonu. Rudolph in suspended animation, prancing year-round with Dasher and Dancer and Vixen on a Kalaupapa rooftop. In or out of season, the Yuletide spirit rhymes just fine with aloha here in Hawaii nei. But holiday cheer of a musical nature is for the most part a December exclusive.
And on the Valley Isle there’s plenty of all kinds to choose from. The Advent festivities commence this afternoon at 3 p.m. at the Maui Arts & Cultural Center’s Castle Theater with the Maui Choral Arts Association in “December Joy: A Choral Concert of Joy and Wonder,” conducted by artistic director Gary Leavitt. Classical arrangements share the bill with pop stylings of traditional favorites as well as novelties. If “Silent Night” seems a distinct possibility, a rousing fortissimo or two is virtually guaranteed. Though in lean months the association gets by with a perfectly respectable tally of some 50 voices, with the influx of “snowbirds” right about this time of year, the ranks double to a roof-raising 100.
To continue in chronological order, two Sundays hence, again at 3 p.m., the Maui Pops fills the Castle with “Holiday Pops,” a blizzard of frothy favorites. Before intermission James Durham, music director and impeccable emcee, brings on seasonal bonbons like “The Christmas Waltz,” “Sleigh Ride” and “Carol of the Drum.” For the second half, the Pops musicians welcome two prolific and much-honored recording artists, both fixtures on the Los Angeles jazz scene.
One is the sophisticated Sara Gazarek, whose “Thirsty Ghost” was just nominated for a Grammy as best jazz vocal album of the year. The other is pianist David Benoit. For a moment of stillness in the swirl, the guests will perform “What Child Is This?” as a duo, while the local musicians listen with folded hands. But mostly, the multitalented Benoit will conduct from the keyboard; the playlist includes his own arrangements of music by the late jazz pianist Vince Guaraldi, whose tracks for “Peanuts” TV specials like “A Charlie Brown Christmas” turned him on to jazz in the first place.
That’s entertainment!
IN A CONTEMPLATIVE VEIN, the Good Shepherd Episcopal Church in Wailuku offers “Lessons and Carols” on Wednesday, Dec. 18. The congregation’s home page reads in part, “We are a church that reflects all of the ethnic diversity of Hawaii, and welcome all whether you are native Hawaiian or arrived last week.” In keeping with ohana priorities, the congregation doesn’t put on a show — it holds a service. But the musical offerings are rich, and the opportunity to sing along has its appeal. Robert E. Wills conducts.
From Dec. 19 to 22 a dozen or so Maui all-stars—among them Jerry Eiting, Dale Button and Marsi Smith — converge on the ProArts Playhouse for “The Reluctant Elf,” an all-new, family-friendly jukebox musical promising dancing reindeer, a singing Santa and, yes, audience participation, all in a swift, chockablock 70 minutes. If you’re flashing on the book by the same name or “Elf,” the Will Ferrell comedy, you’re on the wrong track. Director Ally Shore, who matched an original storyline to “songs you’ll know,” lets the cat out of the bag to this extent: “Our buddy, who’s an elf — no, not that Buddy the Elf — tries to convince his 8-year-old daughter how great it is to work for Santa.” It’s early Christmas for Mikaela Petrilli, set to sparkle in the title role.
Bringing our calendar of Advent musicales to a close, the Maui Chamber Orchestra presents “And on Earth, Peace” at the Historic Iao Theater on Dec. 21 and 22. Mozart’s “Regina Coeli” and J.S. Bach’s Cantata 191, “Gloria in Excelsis,” lend the program a joyous Old World flourish of ecclesiastical drums and trumpets. Bach’s Brandenburg Concerto No. 3, which is never out of season, is on the program, too, along with wide-ranging selection of shorter choral pieces. The conductor is Stephen Spinelli, assistant director of choral programs at Cornell University. Spinelli made his Maui debut last year at the invitation of the MCO’s executive director, John Rowehl. On that occasion Spinelli brought along a cohort of his Cornell singers to augment the MCO Chorus in Franz Joseph Haydn’s majestic “Harmoniemesse” (“Mass With Wind Band”), the last of that great composers major works.
The lovefest between Spinelli and our Maui musicians began even before the visitors landed. “We were very late arriving,” Spinelli said recently. “It was 11 p.m. local time, there was the six-hour time change and we’d had a long delay in Phoenix. We were confused and exhausted and so eager to get to bed. Coming down the escalator in the airport, we heard ukuleles and singers from the MCO chorus, who had waited with John for hours and hours to greet us with lei and a song.
“I teared up,” Spinelli continued. “So did lots of my singers. And when we were about to fly home, a chorister who happened to work in the secure area at the airport brought a suitcase full of chocolate-covered macadamia nuts and handed them to every last member of our group. I couldn’t be more excited to get back to the island to work with the Maui Chamber Orchestra and Chorus. They live in the joy of music. It will be a very special week.”
All this, plus neighborhood carolers and who knows what other pop-up surprises at malls, in office buildings, in restaurants — not to mention the latest edition of the Maui Academy of Performing Arts’ full-length staging of that Christmas perennial “The Nutcracker,” with its infectious Tchaikovsky score, at the Castle on Dec. 20 and 21. But that’s another story. (Watch this space.)

Texto completo: Singapore • One of the most negative byproducts of the Trump presidency is that all we talk about now is Donald Trump . Don’t get me wrong: How can we not be fixated on a president who daily undermines the twin pillars of our democracy: truth and trust?
But there are some tectonic changes underway behind the Trump noise machine that demand a serious national discussion, like the future of U.S.-China relations. Yet it’s not happening — because all we talk about is Donald Trump.
Consider this: On Nov. 9, European leaders gathered in Berlin to mark the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. It was an anniversary worth celebrating. But no one seemed to notice that almost exactly 30 years after the Berlin Wall fell, a new wall — a digital Berlin Wall — had begun to be erected between China and America. And the only thing left to be determined, a Chinese business executive remarked to me, “is how high this wall will be,” and which countries will choose to be on which side.
This new wall, separating a U.S.-led technology and trade zone from a Chinese-led one, will have implications as vast as the wall bisecting Berlin did. Because the peace, prosperity and accelerations in technology and globalization that have so benefited the world over the past 40 years were due, in part, to the interweaving of the U.S. and Chinese economies.
The messy, ad hoc decoupling of these two economies, driven by miscalculations by leaders on both sides, will surely disrupt those trends and the costs could be huge. We might want to talk about that.
Former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson gave a speech here a year ago trying to kick-start that discussion. “For 40 years,” Paulson noted, “the U.S.-China relationship has been characterized by the integration of four things: goods, capital, technology and people. And over these 40 years, economic integration between the two countries was supposed to mitigate security competition. But an intellectually honest appraisal must now admit both that this hasn’t happened and that the reverse is taking place.”
That reversal is happening for two reasons. First, because the U.S. is — rightly — no longer willing to accept China’s unfair trade restrictions on importing of U.S. goods and its stealing of the intellectual property of U.S. firms — something we tolerated for many years before China became a technology powerhouse.
And second, because, now that China is a technology powerhouse — and technological products all have both economic and military applications, unlike the toys, T-shirts and tennis shoes that used to dominate our trade — the two sides are struggling to figure out what to buy and sell from and to each other, without damaging their national security.
The net result, argued Paulson, is that “after 40 years of integration, a surprising number of political and thought leaders on both sides advocate policies that could forcibly de-integrate the two countries across all four of these baskets.” And if that trend continues, “we need to consider the possibility that the integration of global innovation ecosystems will collapse as a result of mutual efforts by the United States and China to exclude one another.”
That, Paulson concluded, is “why I now see the prospect of an Economic Iron Curtain — one that throws up new walls on each side and unmakes the global economy, as we have known it.” Yikes!
One could argue that a digital Berlin Wall began rising years ago when China created its Great Firewall to seal off the internet inside China from the global internet — so Beijing could censor all news and online internal discussions, freezing out Google, Facebook and Twitter. China, as well as other countries, has also begun ring-fencing certain data pools, software and technology stacks to make sure that all of them, or at least key elements, are stored on domestic servers and not accessible from abroad.
But the digital Berlin Wall took a big step up on May 17, when Trump placed China’s Huawei — the world’s second-largest maker of smartphones and the world’s largest manufacturer of 5G telecom equipment — on the U.S. “Entity List.”
That meant that China’s most important technology manufacturer and scores of its affiliates across the globe were blacklisted and could no longer buy parts from their major U.S. suppliers — such as Google, Qualcomm, Intel, Micron and Microsoft — without a special license. U.S. officials argued that Huawei was guilty of facilitating Chinese espionage — or would do so in the future if China’s government asked it to — and had engaged in fraud, technology theft and violations on U.S. sanctions against Iran.
However much justified, this move was the equivalent of China freezing out Apple and Microsoft. In was an earthquake in China’s tech lands. It “woke up everybody in China,” a prominent Chinese telecom executive told me. “We now have to think about this world differently,” the executive explained. “We need to build on a mix of our own technologies to be sure that we are safe. They totally underestimated what they have done.”
Lots of Chinese tech companies are now thinking: We will never, ever, ever leave ourselves again in a situation where we are totally dependent on America for key components. Time to double down on making our own.
At the same time, U.S. manufacturers are saying to themselves: We’d better think twice about building our next factory in China or solely depending on a supply chain from there.
The ripping sound you hear is the sound of two giant economies starting to decouple.
And now that tear is moving to people. Since June 11, the State Department has been restricting visas for Chinese graduate students studying in sensitive fields — like aviation, robotics and advanced manufacturing — to one year, instead of five years. There has also been a crackdown on Chinese investments in anything close to American infrastructure or military-related industries.
On June 25, MIT’s president, L. Rafael Reif, warned the MIT community that “looking at cases across the nation, small numbers of researchers of Chinese background may indeed have acted in bad faith, but they are the exception and very far from the rule. Yet faculty members, post-docs, research staff and students tell me that, in their dealings with government agencies, they now feel unfairly scrutinized, stigmatized and on edge — because of their Chinese ethnicity alone.”
Protracted visa delays and “harsh rhetoric against most immigrants,” Reif added, are sending a message that “the U.S. is closing the door — that we no longer seek to be a magnet for the world’s most driven and creative individuals.”
Over dinner last week in Bangalore, India, with a group of young Indian tech starter-uppers, I heard this message: The number of people who want to stay in India and work on local startups versus going to the U.S. has sharply increased in the last two years. And many of those who do go abroad now prefer Canada and Australia over America. We will pay a price for that over time.
This decoupling is not all Trump’s fault — not by a long shot. China’s president, Xi Jinping, also overplayed his hand, taking over islands in the South China Sea, announcing plans to invest massive amounts so China can dominate critical technologies of the 21st century, tightening Communist Party rule over Hong Kong, sending Muslims in Western China to “re-education” camps and resisting pressures to reduce China’s most abusive trade practices.
The country benefited tremendously from the globalization system that the U.S. and its allies built since World War II, but Beijing has often been grudging about making any sacrifices to maintain it.
Speaking broadly about America’s role in the world versus China’s, a senior Indian diplomat remarked: “America has been fighting without winning for 20 years. China has been winning without fighting for 20 years.”
All this has fed a backlash in the U.S., where even Democrats are now supporting Trump’s hard line on China. “There’s a very quiet debate in China in the party on who lost America,” Jim McGregor, chairman of APCO Worldwide for greater China, said during the recent Times DealBook conference discussion on China. “The extreme direction China has gone has really pushed America away.”
What to do?
I am not blasé about letting China sell technologies in America that might be used for espionage, but I am increasingly of the view that everyone spies on everyone — and always will. I am increasingly of the view that while surely some Chinese students are engaged in espionage, a vast majority are not, and their talents nourish our industries and schools. And I am increasingly worried that by imposing more and more export and visa controls we will be cutting ourselves off from the access we need to the global investment pools, customers and collaborative scientists and engineers to maintain our technological lead.
I still believe that the most open systems win — they get all the signals of change first, they attract the most high-IQ risk-takers/innovators and they enrich and are enriched by the most global flows of talent, ideas and capital. That used to be us.
We need to pause and ask ourselves exactly where we are heading with this whole tech/trade war with China. And Beijing needs to do the same.
China is our economic competitor, economic partner, source of talent and capital, geopolitical rival, collaborator and serial rule-breaker. It is not our enemy or our friend.
The only effective way to manage a relationship this complex is: 1) with an all-of-government approach. You can’t have the Justice Department doing one thing, the Pentagon another, the Treasury another, the trade negotiators another, the State Department another and the president tweeting another. There has to be a tightly coordinated strategy to get the best out of this relationship and cushion the worst. And 2), we need as many Pacific and European allies as possible so it’s “The Whole World Versus China” on the right rules for trade and technology integration in the 21st century, not just Trump versus Xi over who has the biggest tariff.
Unfortunately, Trump has deployed a totally disjointed, impulsive “America First” strategy that has ended up “America Alone” — and weaker. And Xi has been no better. So a relationship that the world needs to work, to drive growth and deal with global problems like climate change, is slowly unraveling. We will miss it when it’s gone.
Or, as Kishore Mahbubani, the Singaporean academic, former diplomat and author of the forthcoming book “Has China Won?” said to me: “I wonder if one day future historians will look back at this contest between Americans and Chinese and compare them to two families of apes fighting with each other while the forest around them is burning.”

Texto completo: My parents were mathematicians. My mother helped code one of the first stored-program computers — the Manchester Mark 1. They taught me that when you program a computer, what you can do is limited only by your imagination. That excitement for experimentation and change helped me build the World Wide Web.
I had hoped that 30 years from its creation, we would be using the web foremost for the purpose of serving humanity. Projects like Wikipedia, OpenStreetMap and the world of open source software are the kinds of constructive tools that I hoped would flow from the web.
However, the reality is much more complex. Communities are being ripped apart as prejudice, hate and disinformation are peddled online. Scammers use the web to steal identities, stalkers use it to harass and intimidate their victims, and bad actors subvert democracy using clever digital tactics. The use of targeted political ads in the United States’ 2020 presidential campaign and in elections elsewhere threatens once again to undermine voters’ understanding and choices.
We’re at a tipping point. How we respond to this abuse will determine whether the web lives up to its potential as a global force for good or leads us into a digital dystopia.
The web needs radical intervention from all those who have power over its future: governments that can legislate and regulate; companies that design products; civil society groups and activists who hold the powerful to account; and every single web user who interacts with others online.
We have to overcome the stalemate that has characterized previous attempts to solve the problems facing the web. Governments must stop blaming platforms for inaction, and companies must become more constructive in shaping future regulation — not just opposing it.
I’m introducing a new approach to overcome that stalemate — the Contract for the Web.
The Contract for the Web is a global plan of action created over the past year by activists, academics, companies, governments and citizens from across the world to make sure our online world is safe, empowering and genuinely for everyone.
The contract outlines steps to prevent the deliberate misuse of the web and our information. For example, it calls on governments to publish public data registries, so that they are no longer able to conceal from their own citizens how their data is being used. If governments are sharing our data with private companies — or buying data broker lists from them — we have a right to know and take action.
The contract sets out ways to improve system design to eradicate incentives that reward clickbait or the spread of disinformation. Targeted political advertising is giving political parties the ability to subvert the debate. We need platforms to open their black boxes and clearly explain how they’re minimizing or eliminating risks their products pose to society. In my view, governments should impose an immediate ban on targeted political advertising to restore trust in our public discourse.
Crucially, the contract also contains concrete actions to tackle the negative — even if unintended — consequences of platform design. For example, why on an exercise app should women have to worry that their precise jogging routes are shared by default with other users? Perhaps because they were designed by people not thinking about the safety needs of women. We need a tremendously more diverse work force in our technology industries to make sure their products serve all groups. And companies should release reports that meaningfully demonstrate their progress toward those diversity goals.
To make the online world a place worth being in, we must all use the Contract for the Web to fight now for the web we want.
Governments must support their citizens online and ensure that their rights are protected through effective regulation and enforcement. Companies must look beyond next-quarter results and understand that long-term success means building products that are good for society and that people can trust them.
There’s already a powerful coalition backing the contract. The governments of nations such as France, Germany and Ghana have signed on to its principles. The tech giants Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Reddit sit alongside other specialists such as the search engine DuckDuckGo in committing to action. Many civil society organizations, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Reporters Without Borders and AccessNow, have joined the growing movement, as well as individuals such as Rep. Ro Khanna of California.
In endorsing the contract, governments and companies commit to taking concrete action across several issues. Some changes may take a long time: We are not expecting overnight transformation. But we will track their efforts, and if they fail to make progress, they will lose their status as a backer of the contract.
The contract is already being used to inform policy decisions, as a best-practice guide for government and company officials, and as a tool to help civil society advocate change, measure progress and hold governments and companies accountable.
But that alone is not enough. Our World Wide Web Foundation, together with its global partners, will work to mobilize people around the world. As elections approach, raise these issues with your political representatives and candidates. The best way to change the priorities and actions of those in power is to speak up.
Join our foundation, our partners and people around the world in the fight for the web.

Study: MRIs Work To Detect Tumors In Women With Dense Tissue

Texto completo: Many women who have mammograms get normal results that come with a caveat: They are told they have dense breast tissue, which can make their scans harder to read and could leave cancer undetected.
Sometimes those patients are advised to follow up by getting ultrasounds or MRI scans, but for many, it is unclear what their next step should be.
Now, a new study provides strong evidence that supplemental MRIs are more effective in finding tumors in these women than mammograms alone.
The study, of more than 40,000 women with extremely dense breasts in the Netherlands, found that those who had mammograms followed by MRIs had more tumors detected than with mammography alone. The research also found that those who had MRIs were less likely to find a cancerous lump in between routine screenings; by the time tumors are big enough to be felt, they tend to be more advanced.
The study, the first large randomized controlled trial of supplemental MRIs in women with dense breasts, was published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday.
A common problem
Just under half of women over the age of 40 have dense breasts, which means their breasts have more connective and fibrous tissue than usual and relatively less fat. Women with dense breast tissue have a higher risk of developing breast cancer than women with more fatty breast tissue.
Dr. Wendie Berg, a professor of radiology at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and chief scientific adviser for DenseBreast-info.org, said the study’s finding were “very important.”
“The standard practice of mammography alone is not adequate for women with extremely dense breasts,” Berg said, adding that her own cancer was detected early enough to require minimal treatment because her family history led her to seek an MRI.
“Women should be advocating for increased access to screening MRI,” she said.
But though the study results were significant, it is still unclear whether supplementing mammograms with MRIs ultimately reduces breast cancer deaths.
Matter of survival
“The ultimate test of the value of MRI screening” in these women will be “whether it improves survival - an answer that we will not have for a very long time,” cautioned Dr. Dan L. Longo, a deputy editor of the New England Journal and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, in an editorial accompanying the study.
For all the promise, there is also a downside to using MRIs for breast cancer screening: They yield many false positive results that lead to unnecessary biopsies, and they can detect very early stage tumors that might never become life-threatening, said Carla van Gils, senior author of the study and a professor of clinical epidemiology at University Medical Center Utrecht.
Lifesaving tool
Nevertheless, van Gils said, the significant reduction in interval cancers - cancers that are diagnosed after a negative mammogram - suggests supplementary MRIs may be a lifesaving tool for women with dense breasts.
“It’s not the same as mortality, but it’s the first step. It’s a prerequisite,” she said, adding that the study is ongoing, and mathematical models will be run to make further predictions about mortality and overdiagnosis. “There are more questions that need to be answered.”
Only about 10% of women have extremely dense tissue like the women in the Dutch study. But having dense breast tissue generally makes it harder to see tumors on a mammogram because both the dense tissue and the tumors show up white on an X-ray. Fat, on the other hand, shows up black, so tumors are easily seen.
Many states now require that women having mammograms be informed that their breast tissue is dense when they get the results, and the Food and Drug Administration is developing similar guidelines. But there is little to no guidance on what women given the information should do about it. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists does not recommend routine use of additional tests after mammography in women who do not have symptoms or other risk factors, though many patients are referred for a supplemental scan.

Texto completo: In the ears and in the heart of Jane Monheit, there is no reason that certain Christmas carols should not ride side-by-side with the works of Duke Ellington and Cole Porter.
And so, when the jazz singer takes the stage at The American Theatre in Phoebus on Saturday night, her set will feature songs from her 2005 Christmas album, "The Season," as well as the American classics through which she has established her career.
"The best of our Christmas songs really do belong to the Great American Songbook, but we only sing them for one month," Monheit said in a phone interview. "I have a million favorites, but if I had to pick one it would be 'Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas.' That's the 'Over the Rainbow' of seasonal songs."
Monheit, 42, grew up on Long Island, New York, the daughter of a chorale singer and a bluegrass musician. She was exposed to a wide variety of music, including the songs on the burgeoning MTV network, but from an early age she found herself drawn mostly to jazz and Broadway show tunes.
She found her hero in Newport News native Ella Fitzgerald. Monheit released her first album, "Never Never Land" (2000) at age 22, selecting some of the songs Fitzgerald had helped to popularize. When she launched her own label and released her 11th recording in 2016, it was "The Songbook Sessions: Ella Fitzgerald." (The name of the label, Emerald City Records, is a nod to another influence, Judy Garland.)
Monheit said she picked up early how Fitzgerald used her voice as one more instrument in the band, and demanded that she have the same responsibilities as the performers around her. Whatever the genre, it falls to the singer to master the technique just like everyone else.
"From the time I was tiny, her records were always my favorites," Monheit said. "Even yesterday, listening to holidays songs on XM, her 'Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas' came on, and I was singing along. How many millions of hours I spent singing along with her records as a kid? She was babysitting me."
That keen ear and early practice paid its dividends. At the respected allmusic.com, reviewer David Adler called Monheit's voice "as close to flawless as a human can get." Christopher Loudon of JazzTimes hears "the honeyed-whiskey gorgeousness of Monheit's voice," and Stephen Holden of the New York Times called it a voice of "phenomenal beauty and flexibility."
She will be backed at The American by her longtime trio - her husband, Rick Montalbano, on drums, Michael Kanan on piano and Neal Miner on bass.
Asked to describe the adrenaline rush she feels every time she steps on stage to sing for an audience, Monheit considers it, briefly at a loss for words.
"All I know is it's something I'm immensely grateful for," she said. "I don't take it for granted. Each time, I always feel like I'm in for a surprise."

Texto completo: The attacks could help the waning outbreak gain new life in an area that has endured heavy fighting.
BENI, Congo -- Rebels have attacked and killed several health workers responding to Ebola in eastern Congo, the head of the World Health Organization said on Thursday, an alarming development that could cause the waning outbreak to regain momentum in an area that has been the site of heavy fighting.
"We are heartbroken that our worst fears have been realized," the official, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said on Twitter.
Three health workers were killed when Mai-Mai fighters attacked a center run by the United Nations health agency overnight in Biakato, a local official, Salambongo Selemani, told The Associated Press. One resident also was killed and Congolese forces killed one attacker and captured two others, Mr. Selemani said.
Warnings had been posted earlier demanding that the health workers leave or face "the worst," he said.
Health workers trying to contain the second-worst Ebola outbreak in history have been targeted in the past, but the current outbreak has been described by some observers as more complicated than any other. Several rebel groups are active in the region, and local officials have said that some of the insurgents believe that the reports of Ebola are a political trick.
"Imagine, a doctor leaves home in the U.S. or elsewhere to come sleep in a tent to help save us from this scourge of Ebola and yet poorly educated young people want to attack him," said Fiston Kamango, a youth leader in Biakato. "It is very deplorable."
In a second attack, Allied Democratic Forces rebels killed a civilian overnight in Mangina, a rural community in Beni territory, according to local official, who added that the target was not the Ebola center but the local population.
The city of Beni, where residents outraged by repeated rebel attacks stormed the local United Nations peacekeeping base, has been the site of unrest. With residents demanding more protection, the World Health Organization evacuated 49 of its workers there, leaving 71 in place.
The Ebola response was put on lockdown in Beni, dismaying health experts who say every attack hurts crucial efforts to contain the deadly virus. Most recent new cases have been reported in the newly targeted communities of Biakato, Mangina and Beni.
The number of cases had been dropping in the yearlong outbreak, which has killed more than 2,100 people and was declared a global health emergency earlier this year. Several days this month, zero cases were reported, but cases have surged after attacks on health workers and facilities.
In one example of how any pause can sharply affect Ebola containment efforts, the World Health Organization has said that no one in Beni could be vaccinated against the virus on Monday. The health agency could previously trace more than 90 percent of contacts of infected people in the city, but that figure has dropped to 17 percent, a United Nations spokesman said on Tuesday.
Residents have accused Congolese and United Nations forces of failing to do enough to protect civilians from the rebels who fight for control of the region's vast mineral wealth. The Allied Democratic Forces alone have been blamed for the deaths of more than 1,500 people in and around Beni in the past four years.
The latest rebel attack outside Beni killed 19 people, the United Nations said on Wednesday.
After an emergency meeting on Monday, President Felix Tshisekedi decided to allow joint operations between Congolese and United Nations forces in Beni following the protests that also burned the town hall.
Far from the capital, Kinshasa, some traumatized residents in the densely populated border region near Uganda and Rwanda are wary of outsiders, further complicating the containment work in a part of Congo that had never recorded the Ebola virus before.
Despite two promising new Ebola vaccines, health workers continue to battle misinformation and reluctance to seek treatment for the virus that is largely spread via close contact with the bodily fluids of infected people, including the dead.
In addition, many local health workers have been recruited to work on the Ebola response, leading to shortages of trained people to deal with other serious health issues such as an even deadlier measles outbreak and malaria, the medical charity Doctors Without Borders said in a statement.

Texto completo: George Conway denied a rumor that he and his wife, Kellyanne Conway, had partnered to write the anonymous tell-all book about the Trump administration.
CNN contributor John Dean floated the theory that the two could have been responsible for the book A Warning, a tell-all about the Trump administration that was written by the anonymous author of a New York Times op-ed from a senior official describing the efforts to resist President Trump from within his administration.
Dean said he had read A Warning and compared it to George Conway’s column in the Atlantic and said the two had similar writing styles.
“Reading this piece while reading 'A Warning' by Anonymous strongly suggests Anonymous is a collaboration of Kellyanne and George Conway,” Dean tweeted. “Similar style. Anonymous told Reddit yesterday that s/he will publicly identify before Nov. 3, 2020 — Election Day.”Tweet
Conway, 56, shut down Dean’s theory, tweeting, “I wish. But no.”
Tweet
The Conways hold very different political views. George has advocated for Trump’s removal from office for months while Kellyanne remains one of Trump’s most loyal supporters. George has gone as far as saying that Kellyanne was “in a cult.” Kellyanne has preferred to keep her husband out of the headlines, according to a report from Vanity Fair.
Trump chimed in on their political tensions last week, saying, “I don’t know what Kellyanne did to that guy. I don’t even know him. I met him for a second. He's got to be some kind of a nut job. She must have done some bad things to him because that guy is crazy."
Conspiracies about who Anonymous might be have been floating around since the New York Times op-ed was published. A former speechwriter for ex-Defense Secretary James Mattis, Guy Snodgrass, had toyed with rumors that he was responsible for the book but eventually denied that he was the author.
The real Anonymous vowed to confront Trump in person before the 2020 elections. In a post to Reddit, the author wrote, “Trump will hear from me, in my own name, before the 2020 election. As far as anonymity is concerned, I will not keep my identity shrouded in secrecy forever. I am not afraid to use my own name to express concern about the current occupant of the Oval Office.”

OGUNQUIT — For his senior thesis at Bates College in Lewiston, senior studio art major Matt Tavares wrote and illustrated a children’s picture book about a boy who caught a magic foul ball at Fenway Park.
<img class="size-medium wp-image-12679274" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/11/Dasher-cover-300x269.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="269" />
He could not have imagined that 22 years after his graduation, he would have 20 published volumes, including his most recent— a lushly illustrated tale of how Santa got his reindeer.
“Dasher,” the new book, landed on The New York Times’ bestseller list shortly before Thanksgiving, a first for the acclaimed children’s writer and illustrator.
Tavares is “very happily surprised” about that.
The book’s roots lie in a call from his editor, who suggested he try a holiday-themed book featuring animal characters, the sort of volume that could, with a little luck, catch the public’s eye.
Tavares said he liked the concept but after mulling it all day, “I came up with nothing” beyond the possibility it could focus on reindeer.
Then as he was making the 10-minute drive between his home and his 12-year-old daughter’s basketball practice in Wells, “the whole story” came to him: a tale of a brave reindeer doe in a traveling circus, dreaming of freedom under the North Star.
Without giving much away, Dasher reaches Santa and the holiday magic triumphs, filling a major gap in the whole Santa story: just where did those flying reindeer come from?
“It feels like the story of Christmas,” Tavares said, and the words and art he produced to bring it to life have obviously resonated with others.
“It’s fun to have this happen,” he said, with “Dasher” now one of the best-selling children’s books this season.
“Gorgeous illustrations make this one sure to fly off shelves ‘like the down of a thistle,’” Kirkus Reviews pronounced.
But the one that got him started is that long-ago thesis back at Bates, which he called “a dress rehearsal of what I do now” during a recent interview in his small studio in his purple-painted home with a white picket fence just a short walk from the ocean.
Tavares, who grew up in Winchester, Massachusetts, a Boston suburb, said he’s always loved to draw.
But he wasn’t sure at age 17 that he was quite ready to commit himself to a career as an artist.
So he opted to go to Bates, a liberal arts school with a solid arts program in a new building that seemed to have smart teachers and a warm atmosphere.
“It just felt right,” Tavares said.
Tavares felt comfortable heading to Maine for college. He’d been vacationing every summer in Ogunquit for years with his parents and three sisters, he said. His parents bought a place there when he was in about fifth grade, he said.
At Bates, he said, he thought about his future, trying “to figure out how to draw every day as a grown-up.”
Paintings and galleries “never really appealed to me,” Tavares said, but the picture books he remembered from childhood did.
As he contemplated his options, thinking about some Norman Rockwell creations he loved, the notion of illustrating a children’s book began to grow on him.
“I was really drawn to that,” he said, in part because “a children’s book, it lasts forever,” or at least a lot longer than the average illustration. Its permanence mattered to him.
Tavares had long recognized that the best children’s books often contained some terrific art, from favorites such as Dr. Seuss to Bernard Waber’s “Ira Sleeps Over,” a 1972 volume he read “a million times” because he loved it so much.
Chris Van Allsburg’s “The Widow’s Broom,” a 1992 children’s book with gorgeous sepia-toned drawings, showed him what was possible artistically.
“Really into baseball,” Tavares said, he decided to create a volume that focused on the game. He said he set it at Fenway Park because it “is this pretty magical place and I wanted to capture that as a book.”
<img class="size-medium wp-image-12710830" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/11/Tavares-1-300x230.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="230" />
He said his professors encouraged him to try it. Tavares said his thesis adviser, Robert Feintuch, believed in letting students explore their ideas.
He hoped from the start that he could get the book published, but he didn’t know anyone who could help.
“In a way, it’s good that I knew nothing about the publishing industry and what I was up against,” Tavares said.
He found an agent, though, who was a friend of a friend and she shopped the book around, landing him a deal with Candlewick Press that has served him well ever since.
After graduation in 1997, he moved to Arlington, Massachusetts, outside Boston, where he lived for five years, working on more books, often about baseball, and meeting the woman who became his wife, Sarah, a special education teacher who grew up in Wiscasset.
He and Sarah moved into the house in Ogunquit that Tavares’ parents had bought years earlier, renting it at first and then buying it for themselves as they raised two children there.
Looking around his studio, with shelves full of children’s books and graphic novels, Tavares said he can remember sitting in the room as a child, coloring with crayons.
He’s come a long way, learning all sorts of techniques, including how to draw on a computer, to create stunning art.
Tavares, for instance, illustrated a book about Benjamin Franklin’s boyhood that’s due out in March. He just got the final proofs that show exactly what it will look like.
At one point, he said, an editor thought the Boston docks in one picture looked “too dusty,” the sort of thing that would be tough to change on paper or canvas.
<img class="size-medium wp-image-12710854" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/11/Tavares-4-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" />
On the computer, though, Tavares said he simply removed the third of three layers of dust from the illustration, instantly making it less dusty.
He could also move ships or people around, getting everything just so.
For Tavares, the ability to keep learning new ways to create his art is part of the craft.
“It’s fun to mix it up between the different kinds of books,” he said.
It’s not a lonely endeavor either.
Tavares said he talks often with others in his field. They even have a Skype group where they regularly offer tips and share their work.
“It’s cool to see what other people are working on,” Tavares said. “A good number of us are in Maine.”
Looking around at shelves and cabinets full of his work, his table mostly clear with just a few pencil drawings at the edge, he said it’s a good life.
“This is my favorite part,” Tavares said, “getting to sit here in my studio and draw.”
“This is really important to me. This is what I want to do,” he said. “Kids are a great audience.”

Texto completo: To the Editor:
Re "After Outcry Over Blackface, Virginia's Governor Rebounds" (front page, Nov. 12):
Virginia Democrats, having won control of the Legislature for the first time in a generation, are eager to advance their agenda by working with Gov. Ralph Northam. But viewing Virginia's off-year election in purely partisan colors obscures significant voter concerns that both parties' establishments have yet to address.
Consider this: In a bid to salvage its influence over Virginia's energy policy, Dominion Energy -- the state's biggest corporate campaign donor by far -- increased its political giving by more than 35 percent over any past election cycle this decade.
Yet this largess failed to prevent the election of nearly 50 candidates -- including all eight who flipped seats to Democrats -- who pointedly refused its money.
Until recently, taking Dominion's money and supporting its self-serving legislative proposals were widely considered de rigueur by both parties. Virginians know that Dominion has amassed hundreds of millions in excess profits as Virginia families struggle to afford their electric bills.
Rural landowners and environmental justice advocates have united in opposition to Dominion's proposed Atlantic Coast Pipeline. And the fact that sinking billions of captive customer dollars into that fossil fuel project flies in the face of Governor Northam's well-received call for 100 percent zero-carbon electricity by 2050 has not gone unnoticed.
The next General Assembly, and the governor, have a clear mandate to put an end to the special favors that enrich monopoly utilities at great cost to Virginians.

Texto completo: News from around Ohio:
Pay floor: 57% of Ohio voters in 2006 approved changing Ohio’s constitution to increase the minimum wage with inflation. Next year, it will be $8.70 an hour, well above the federal rate of $7.25 that last changed in 2009 - a difference of $3,000 for a full-time worker over a year, cleveland.com’s Rich Exner reports.
Stock issue: The Ohio Supreme Court has agreed to hear an appeal over whether the gun-rights groups Buckeye Firearms and Ohioans for Concealed Carry have standing to challenge the city of Columbus’ ban on bump stocks. As cleveland.com’s Jeremy Pelzer writes, if the court sides against the city, it could open the door to other activist groups challenging local ordinances on a variety of topics.
Attempted hack: Hackers in Panama, associated with a Russian-owned company, tried to get into the Ohio Secretary of State’s website, as well as state internal systems, the Dispatch’s Rick Rouan reports. Secretary of State Frank LaRose called the attempt relatively unsophisticated, and that election machines and ballot counters are not connected to the internet.
Opening offices: Democratic presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren, the only Dem with paid staff in Ohio, is opening offices in Cleveland on Tuesday on Columbus on Dec. 4 and Cincinnati on Dec. 5. She’s believed to be the only Democratic presidential candidate with offices in Ohio - a sign that she expects to win enough state primaries to continue on in the race through the Ohio’s March 17 primary.
Speaking circuit: The Dayton Daily News’ Laura Bischoff got a copy of the contract between Miami University and Greater Talent Network LLC, which represents John Kasich, for a speech he gave Nov. 13. He was paid $40,000, got an armed security guard, “cool” water throughout the talk and a five-star hotel room with a king bed. Kasich was criticized by a Miami professor for the lucrative gig, when as governor he called on colleges to cut costs and increase professor teaching load.
So ordered: Franklin County Common Pleas Judge Kimberly Cocroft has granted a five-month extension in the state’s case against the former e-charter school known as the Electronic Classroom of Tomorrow, or ECOT. Ohio Attorney General David Yost, and defendants - including Bill Lager, his for-profit companies Altair Learning Management and IQ Innovations - jointly asked for more time, as first reported by Gongwer. The state is suing to recoup money from ECOT and Lager, saying they took state education money for students who merely logged in and didn’t complete tasks.
Fighting tax: Some residents in conservative Clermont County east of Cincinnati took matters into their own hands after Amelia imposed a 1% municipal income tax. They voted this month to dissolve the village. Now, the changes are starting to be seen, as the New York Times reported in a feature story. Amelia’s seven police officers lost their jobs. And residents of the former village will no longer be part of the same government; they will be in separate townships divided by Main Street.
Armor all: Since July 2018, the Ohio attorney general’s office has awarded a total of almost $4 million to 426 law-enforcement agencies around Ohio to purchase body-armor vests, according to a release from AG Dave Yost. That includes more than $345,000 in the last three months alone. The money for the program comes from the Ohio Bureau of Workers’ Compensation as part of its Safety Intervention Grant Program.
Medicare for all: 71% of Ohioans favor giving some people under the age of 65 the option to buy insurance from Medicare, according to Interact for Health’s Ohio Health Issues Poll, which asked a similar question that the Kaiser Family Foundation has asked nationwide. The Ohio poll didn’t ask people other questions in the Medicare-for-all discussion, such as whether they would support nixing private health insurance for Medicare.

Texto completo: Amajor campaign against single-payer health care or Medicare-for-all if you prefer has been waging the past several months.
A health system that has served most of the rest of the civilized world quite well the past many decades at relatively half the cost that Americans spend has been demonized as unworkable and hopelessly unaffordable.
Worse, of course, it's been labeled socialistic, a "far left" idea and, therefore, un-American.
Recent polling shows that many Americans have bought the arguments made by those whose profits depend on maintaining the status quo. The claim is that a single-payer plan will cost $50 trillion over the next 10 years and force working Americans to give up their coveted employer-provided insurance. What they fail to mention is that the cost of our current system, if left unchanged, will cost even more than that.
A consortium of insurance companies, for-profit hospitals and drug conglomerates have been spending millions to spew nonsense for instance, that you will lose your doctor and be forced to stand in line for medical treatment. The so-called Partnership for America's Health Care Future, a consortium of organizations and businesses that thrive under our current system, has been spending millions to protect the status quo.
And all too often, a gullible media take it as the gospel truth.
There's no question that Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act was a giant step forward, insuring low-income Americans, who never were covered before, through Medicaid and insurance exchanges. But, thanks to sabotage by the Trump administration, it's been weakened, and the number of Americans without any health care coverage is rising once again. Latest figures show 27.5 million Americans are uncovered.
As for the employer-paid private insurance that the for-profit consortium laments will be lost under a single-payer system, I've been clipping stories about just how well that's working.
They tell of the heartbreak when patients learn from their private insurers that certain treatments aren't covered. The Chicago Tribune reported a sad story recently about an insurance company declining five times to pay for treatment for a 4-year-old, only acquiescing when the paper got involved.
There are stories about frantic families being plunged into bankruptcy because they can't afford even the co-pays that are increasing each year, or the growing thresholds that the sick must cover before insurance kicks in.
And, no, these aren't problems confined to Medicaid cases or low-cost insurance plans that offer scant protection. They are occurring regularly in those employer-paid private plans, too.
In September, the New York Times reported how some hospitals and medical centers are getting tough on those who owe them money. Under the headline, "Proficient at Healing, and Suing," the paper reported how the Carlsbad Medical Center in New Mexico had filed 3,000 lawsuits against patients in the past four years. The Memphis- based Methodist Le Bonheur Healthcare has filed 8,300 suits in the past five years.
But, even they pale compared to Virginia, where hospitals filed more than 20,000 lawsuits in 2017 alone.
"The majority of accounts from which we seek to collect payments are patients with insurance who have not fulfilled their deductible, co-payment or coinsurance responsibility set by their health insurance plan," a spokesperson for the Carlsbad group said.
Meanwhile, the skyrocketing cost of drugs is forcing many Americans to skimp on medications, prompting alarm from the National Center for Health Statistics. What's surprising, the center reported, is that 14% of patients with private insurance have been forced to go without their medicine.
As any senior citizen on Medicare can attest, these aren't problems under a single-payer system.
Yet, it's demonized as "far left," when, in fact, it ought to be mainstream.

Must-see TV? It isn't Bears [Corrected 11/27/2019]

Texto completo: You know how you stumble across ABC's 30-year-old "America's Funniest Home Videos" and are always surprised it's still on the air?
That's how it has been with the 2019 Chicago Bears.
They keep showing up on national TV -- including a Thanksgiving meeting with the Lions and a week later against the Cowboys on "Thursday Night Football" -- no matter how they play.
It turns out Bears fans weren't the only people fooled into great expectations for coach Matt Nagy and Co. based on last season's 12-4 finish, despite their early ouster from the playoffs.
The NFL and its TV partners also bet big on the Bears this season -- and America's viewers lost as a result, force-fed a steady diet of Mitch Trubisky whether they like it or not.
The 5-6 Bears are the embodiment of meh.
They're hardly the most compelling, competitive or entertaining NFL team.
Their vaunted defensive prowess is badly handicapped by a decidedly lackluster offense.
Nothing about their play to date screams, "You've got to see this." Not in a good way at least.
Yet the Bears' next two games are locked into national TV showcases with Joe Buck and Troy Aikman on the call, with still another prime-time appearance penciled in on the schedule.
NBC and the NFL could switch the Bears out of their scheduled Dec. 22 "Sunday Night Football" appearance with the AFC West-leading Chiefs, a fifth prime-time turn for the Bears this disappointing season.
But, believe it or not, it's also possible they could stick with the matchup for lack of better options.
Obviously, the Bears playing in the country's No. 3 TV market figured into the TV scheduling. So too did the charter NFL franchise's heritage as the league celebrates its 100th season.
But overestimating their competitiveness and how interesting they would be to watch no doubt was a factor as well.
One might pair the historically mediocre Lions with the Bears in Fox's Thanksgiving Day slot for tradition's sake. But you know everyone from the schedule-makers on up had much higher hopes for the Bears and Cowboys when they put them down for a December prime-time date on Fox and NFL Network.
The Cowboys, 6-5 atop the NFC East, remain more likely than not to make the playoffs, according to the outfits that forecast that sort of thing.
As per fivethirtyeight.com and playoffstatus.com, however, the Bears have only a 2% chance of making the playoffs. The New York Times pegs their chances at a mere 1%.
Even if the Bears win in Detroit, giving them a .500 record heading into the Dec. 5 prime-time meeting with the Cowboys, much of the matchup's initial gleam is long gone.
It won't be as bad as some ESPN "Monday Night Football" games have been this season (i.e. Browns-Jets, Bengals-Steelers, Dolphins-Steelers), but it's not ideal.
Then there's the possibility NBC may be stuck with Chiefs-Bears if it decides it can't come up with a better combo.
The best matchup that weekend might be Cowboys-Eagles, but Fox has that scheduled as its late-afternoon game and almost certainly has locked it down so NBC can't take it away. Besides, NBC already had that matchup Oct. 20.
Further complicating matters is
NFL Network plucked three games for Saturday, Dec. 21, taking two good games in the process with Rams-49ers and Bills-Patriots.
Panthers-Colts and Saints-Titans are still options to sub for Chiefs-Bears.
NBC doesn't have to decide until Dec. 10. Who knows? A lot could change by then.
If NBC sticks with the Bears, though, imagine how often Al Michaels and Cris Collinsworth will mention how general manager Ryan Pace traded up for a quarterback but left reigning NFL
Most Valuable Player Patrick Mahomes for the Chiefs.
Also, imagine all the viewers coast to coast left to wonder why they're watching the Bears yet again.

U.S. News: Trump Knew of Whistlebower Complaint

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- President Trump was briefed about the whistleblower complaint prompted by his dealings with Kyiv before the White House lifted a hold on more than $391 million in aid to Ukraine, according to people familiar with the matter.
The president was briefed about the complaint in August by White House counsel Pat Cipollone and John Eisenberg, an attorney with the White House National Security Council, the people said. The complaint triggered the impeachment inquiry by Democrats in the House, which Mr. Trump has dismissed as a hoax.
The inquiry alleges that Mr. Trump abused the power of his office by pressing Ukraine to open investigations that could benefit him politically at a time when he had ordered congressionally approved Ukraine aid put on hold. The White House has defended the president's actions, in part by saying there was no link between suspending the aid and the president's request for investigations because the hold on the money was lifted in September.
The August briefing Mr. Trump received from the White House lawyers, which was earlier reported by the New York Times, indicates Mr. Trump was aware of the whistleblower complaint before he ordered the hold on aid lifted.
A White House spokeswoman didn't respond to a request for comment.
Messrs. Cipollone and Eisenberg had known in early July about concerns from White House officials about Mr. Trump's request to Ukraine but didn't relay those concerns to the president, The Wall Street Journal has reported.
Mr. Trump said at an Oct. 2 news conference that he lifted the aid after a request from Sen. Rob Portman (R., Ohio).
The whistleblower complaint followed a July 25 call between Mr. Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which Mr. Trump asked his counterpart to work with Mr. Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, and Attorney General William Barr on investigations that could benefit Mr. Trump, including into former Vice President Joe Biden, a 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful. Mr. Trump has termed the call "perfect."

TODAY'S EXPLAINER NAVY SEAL: Why SEAL Gallagher is at center of war crimes case: The Navy and President Donald Trump have been in a tug of war over Chief Petty Officer Edward Gallagher, the Navy SEAL at the center of a highly publicized war crimes case. The Navy prosecuted Gallagher and moved to expel him from the SEALs, but the president, as commander in chief, has repeatedly intervened in the sailor's favor.

Texto completo: Gallagher, 40, enlisted in the Navy as a medic in 1999 and deployed to Iraq attached to a Marine infantry unit. He became one of the few Navy medics ever to complete the Marines' demanding scout sniper school.
He graduated from Basic Underwater Demolition in 2005 and joined the SEALs. Since then, he has deployed to combat zones with the SEALs five times, rising to become a special operations chief, as SEAL chief petty officers are known.
He was named the top platoon leader in SEAL Team 7 and has been awarded several Bronze Stars.
Since his arrest last fall, Gallagher's supporters have portrayed him as being unfairly prosecuted over heat-of-the-moment decisions. But his critics, including some fellow SEALs, have said he'd become a rogue operator and had committed acts of unnecessary violence.
What was he accused of?
SEALs from the platoon that Gallagher led during a deployment to Mosul, Iraq, in 2017 said they saw the chief kill a wounded ISIS captive. Navy investigators said while several SEALs were giving medical aid to the fighter, Gallagher stabbed him several times in the neck and torso with a hunting knife.
He also was accused of firing a sniper rifle at civilians, striking a girl and an old man. Several SEALs broke the group's code of silence and testified against him.
What happened in the court-martial?
The trial, which started in late June, was marred by accusations of prosecutorial misconduct and a witness who changed his story on the stand.
Gallagher was acquitted of murder, attempted murder and obstruction of justice. But the chief was convicted of a less-serious charge for posing for inappropriate photos with the dead captive. He was sentenced to four months' time served. The jury also ordered him demoted one rank to petty officer first class.
During the sentencing, Gallagher said he had put "a black eye" on the Marine Corps and Navy. "I've made mistakes in my 20-year career -- tactical, ethical, moral -- I'm not perfect," he said. "But I've always bounced back from my mistakes."
Why did the Navy want him out of the SEALs?
Officials uncovered evidence that Gallagher had violated regulations in a number of ways: A live training grenade was found in his garage. He texted about using drugs with other SEALs.
That behavior, along with his criminal conviction, has rankled the commander of the SEALs, Rear Adm. Collin Green. A sailor can be expelled from the SEALs if a commander loses "faith and confidence in the service member's ability to exercise sound judgment, reliability and personal conduct."
The Navy has expelled more than 150 sailors from the SEALs since 2011.
How has Trump helped him?
Trump has tweeted supportive messages for Gallagher. After the court-martial verdict the president said of him and his family, "You have been through much together."
The president ordered less restrictive confinement for Gallagher while he awaited trial, reversed his demotion and restored his rank to CPO after the verdict. Last week, he announced that he would prevent the Navy from kicking him out of the SEALs.

Texto completo: Martin Scorsese's acclaimed new gangster movie hits Netflix. And get Thanksgiving inspiration from "Julie & Julia," which airs on Showtime.
What's Streaming
THE IRISHMAN (2019) Stream on Netflix. "I don't think 10 years ago, he makes a film like this," Al Pacino said in a recent interview with The New York Times. The "he" there is Martin Scorsese, and the film is "The Irishman," Scorsese's new mob epic, which deals with made men, hits and betrayals, and with aging and legacy. Robert De Niro plays Frank Sheeran, a former hit man who tells the story of his life in organized crime. (He is based on a real person.) That story, seen in flashbacks that make up a large part of the movie, revolves around work for a Mafia figure played by Joe Pesci and, ultimately, and involves the disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa (played by Pacino). Bobby Cannavale, Anna Paquin and Ray Romano are in the film's ensemble. "The movie is long and dark: long like a novel by Dostoyevsky or Dreiser, dark like a painting by Rembrandt," A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The Times. "This is Scorsese's least sentimental picture of mob life," Scott added, "and for that reason his most poignant."
FORKY ASKS A QUESTION Stream on Disney Plus. Parents who want to watch "The Irishman" will need something to distract their young ones. This Pixar series should do the trick -- at least for a short while. "Forky Asks a Question" stars Forky, the haphazardly assembled spork toy voiced by Tony Hale in "Toy Story 4." Each short sees that character exploring a different topic by asking his friends about it (examples of subjects include money and art). "Toy Story" enthusiasts may enjoy the fact that those friends are various characters from the series.
NOWHERE TO HIDE (2000) Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. In a recent article in The Times, Mike Hale wrote that this cops-and-gangsters movie from the South Korean filmmaker Lee Myung-se is the "greatest unknown movie of the century so far." It will be screening at Lincoln Center on Nov. 30, but audiences outside the city (or who simply want to avoid a weekend excursion) can stream it from home. The story is simple: In Incheon, South Korea, a cop hunts a gangster. But the film's style is hard to pin down. "It slips back and forth from high-octane chase to slow-motion slapstick ballet to noirish, rain-soaked romance, the way an old-fashioned Hollywood musical changes up song styles," Hale wrote. "If you can negotiate the shifting tones and rhythms," he added, "Lee's guerrilla-like inventiveness will keep a nearly constant smile on your face."
What's on TV
JULIE & JULIA (2009) 5:55 p.m. on Showtime. Set to air right in time to inspire (or intimidate) home cooks readying for Thanksgiving, this dramedy from Nora Ephron is filled with great food. Meryl Streep plays Julia Child, the famous chef; Amy Adams plays Julie Powell, the blogger who in the early 2000s famously chronicled her attempts to cook through the entirety of "Mastering the Art of French Cooking," the seminal cookbook that Child was an author of.

Texto completo: The bill, called the Preventing Animal Cruelty and Torture Act, makes intentional acts of cruelty to animals federal crimes carrying penalties of up to seven years in prison.
In a rare display of political unity, President Trump on Monday signed a bipartisan bill that, for the first time, makes acts of animal cruelty a federal crime punishable with fines and up to seven years in prison.
The bill, called the Preventing Animal Cruelty and Torture Act, was introduced in the House this year by two Florida lawmakers -- Representative Vern Buchanan, a Republican, and Representative Ted Deutch, a Democrat. It expands a 2010 law signed by President Barack Obama that banned videos that show animals being crushed, burned, drowned, suffocated, impaled or subjected to other forms of torture.
Now, intentional acts of cruelty shown in the videos are also felony offenses.
"It is important that we combat these heinous and sadistic acts of cruelty, which are totally unacceptable in a civilized society," Mr. Trump said at a signing ceremony on Monday, where he was joined by Mr. Buchanan and animal rights advocates.
The bill was passed unanimously by a voice vote in the House in October. It was passed unanimously by the Senate in November and went into effect on Monday.
Mr. Buchanan said that signing the bill "into law is a significant milestone for pet owners and animal lovers across the country."
Federal law already bans sponsoring animal fights.
Laws in all 50 states already include felony provisions for animal cruelty. But the federal bill would help prosecutors address cases of abused animals that cross state lines, animal rights groups have said. It could also funnel more resources toward investigating and prosecuting animal cruelty cases.
The additional step of making acts of cruelty a crime "makes a statement about American values," said Kitty Block, president and chief executive of the Humane Society of the United States.
"The approval of this measure by the Congress and the president marks a new era in the codification of kindness to animals within federal law," she said. "For decades, a national anti-cruelty law was a dream for animal protectionists. Today, it is a reality."
Chris Schindler, vice president of field services at the Humane Rescue Alliance, said in a statement on Monday that the law would be particularly important in the District of Columbia, where cruelty cases often involve multiple jurisdictions and, on occasion, federal property.
"Our officers investigate thousands of animal cruelty cases each year, but have been unable to truly bring justice for the animals in instances when the cruelty occurs across multiple jurisdictions," he said. "The PACT Act is a necessary tool for us to provide further protections for animals and our community, and will ensure some of the most horrific acts of animal cruelty are prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law."
The bill would not apply to people who slaughter animals for food or to those who hunt, trap and fish.
Federal action addressing animal cruelty stretches back to the late 1990s, after the Humane Society of the United States began investigating "crush videos," in which animals are tortured or killed, often under a woman's foot, in the service of a sexual fetish.
The federal government enacted a law in 1999 that made the production and sale of such videos a federal crime. But in 2010, the Supreme Court ruled that law unconstitutional on First Amendment grounds after some argued it was overly broad.
A replacement bill was passed and signed by Mr. Obama in 2010.

ANOTHER THANKSGIVING MARRED BY ROMAINE RECALL. The more things change the more they romaine the same.
For the second Thanksgiving season in a row, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has warned the public to avoid eating romaine because it may have been infected by E. coli. While last year government officials issued an unusually blanket warning to the public to avoid all romaine, this year’s warning is more narrow: Officials have said people should specifically avoid romaine lettuce that comes from Salinas Valley, California.
As of Friday, 40 people in 16 states were infected as a result of eating the lettuce. The majority of illnesses were severe, with at least 28 hospitalizations, but no deaths.
The E. coli infestation is similar to the outbreak last year, and the strain that is circulating can cause kidney failure. Thanksgiving already makes the CDC nervous about food poisoning from improper food prep. Sometimes food poisoning doesn't set in for several days, making it difficult to figure out what part of the meal might have gone bad.
For the romaine, it’s not yet clear what the source is. Other than the CDC, the Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration work together on food safety. The FDA specifically works with states to try to find out which brand, grower, supplier, or distributor might be responsible for the outbreak.
Scott Gottlieb, the former FDA commissioner, laid out in a tweet how complicated it could be for scientists to track down the cause.
“Another Thanksgiving another romaine recall,” Gottlieb said. “The specific E. coli strain is exactly the same one that caused last year’s outbreak. We must ask if there are systemic problems with open water sources, nearby cattle crazing, or susceptibility of the product itself.”
The CDC doesn't break down illnesses that happen specifically around Thanksgiving, but it estimates that each year 48 million people get sick from foodborne illnesses, 128,000 are hospitalized, and 3,000 die.

TRUMP’S LATEST THINKING ON VAPING: President Trump engaged in a new line of thinking about vaping and the possibility of a flavor ban in a meeting Friday with industry officials and activists, suggesting the possibility that regulation could lead to dangerous illicit vaping. "You watch prohibition, you look with the alcohol, you look at cigarettes… Instead of Reynolds or Juul, or, you know, legitimate companies, good companies making something that's safe, they're going to be selling stuff on a street corner that could be horrible,” he said.
The general consensus among vaping representatives at the meeting, like Juul CEO K.C. Crosthwaite, NJOY CEO Ryan Nivakoff, and Vapor Technology Association executive director Tony Abboud was that the minimum purchasing age nationwide should be 21, not 18. After about an hour of tobacco opponents and vaping advocates talking over one another, straddling the line between a spirited debate and a heated argument, the press was ushered out. Trump did say, however: "We'll be announcing very soon… but we're going to continue this meeting for a little while."
TRUMP RAISES EXPECTATIONS FOR DRUG IMPORTATION RULE: In case you missed it, Trump raised expectations Friday that a rule for importing drugs from Canada, first promised by Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar in July, is coming soon.
RBG IS ‘DOING WELL’ AFTER WEEKEND AT THE HOSPITAL: Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was discharged from Johns Hopkins Hospital Sunday having experienced chills and fever on Friday. She was given intravenous antibiotics, and SCOTUS spokesperson Kathleen Arberg said “her symptoms have abated” and she is doing well.

Texto completo: Los demócratas ganaron este lunes una batalla legal contra la negativa de Donald Trump a dejar participar a sus principales asesores en las audiencias para su juicio político. Un juez falló que el antiguo asesor del presidente Donald F. McGahn II deberá declarar ante los investigadores del ‘impeachment’ sobre si Trump obstruyó la investigación Mueller .
El juez Ketanji Brown Jackson, del Tribunal de Distrito Federal para el Distrito de Columbia, rechazó el bloqueo de la administración Trump al proceso de juicio político contra el presidente . El gobierno había afirmado que los principales asesores de Trump estaban exentos de hablar sobre sus deberes oficiales y que, por tanto, ni siquiera acudirían a una citación.
Sin embargo, esto no garantiza que McGahn testifique pronto ya que lo más seguro es que el Departamento de Justicia presentará una apelación para que se suspenda el fallo del juez. El afectado y su abogado, William A. Burck, defienden que la batalla se libra entre el Congreso y la administración Trump para que los abogados del gobierno sean los que manejen el caso.
“Don McGahn acatará la decisión del juez Jackson a menos que se suspenda mientras se espera apelación”, dijo Burck a The New York Times por correo electrónico. “El Departamento de Justicia está manejando este caso, por lo que deberá preguntarles si tienen la intención de solicitar una suspensión”, añadió.
Aunque el Departamento de Justicia pida la suspensión para hacer apelaciones, el fallo también alcanza a la inmunidad que la Casa Blanca ha invocado sobre otros testigos para no colaborar con la investigación de los demócratas en el Congreso . Varios de ellos ya se han acogido a la teoría de la administración para negarse a declarar por el escándalo ucraniano.
Si McGahn se niega a testificar hasta que el caso llegue a la Corte Suprema y esta emita un fallo, es posible que el asunto no se resuelva a tiempo para que la declaración del exasesor del presidente tenga un peso importante en la investigación.

Anti-Immigrant Tale Retains Its Influence

Texto completo: "The Camp of the Saints," published in 1973, has been a must-read within white supremacist circles for decades. Stephen Miller, Marine Le Pen and Steve King have touted it in recent years.
One morning in 1972, the French author Jean Raspail was at his home on the Mediterranean coast when he had a vision of a million refugees clamoring to enter Europe.
"Armed only with their weakness and their numbers, overwhelmed by misery, encumbered with starving brown and black children, ready to disembark on our soil," he wrote. "To let them in would destroy us. To reject them would destroy them."
At the time Raspail was a respected writer best known for his travelogues. But the racist novel that resulted from that episode, "The Camp of the Saints," would become his most famous, most controversial and, surprisingly, most influential work.
For some 30 years, "'Camp of the Saints' has been one of the top two books in white supremacist circles," said Heidi Beirich, an expert on extremism at the Southern Poverty Law Center. The center leaked emails earlier this month in which the Trump adviser Stephen Miller touted the book to Breitbart staffers as a work with strong parallels to recent waves of migration.
Published in 1973, the dystopian novel details how a flotilla of Indian migrants reach France's southern coast to invade the country. Political elites fail to respond to the influx, and the continent is overrun. For nearly half a century, the book has stoked fears of immigration that have, to its supporters, seemed increasingly prescient as growing numbers of refugees and asylum seekers have arrived in Europe in recent years.
"Raspail can boast himself about being a prophet," said Jean-Yves Camus, an expert on the far right at the French Institute for International and Strategic Affairs. "People now buy 'The Camp of the Saints' because they want to read the book written by the writer who saw what would happen before everybody else."
What Raspail described as a "parable" came to be seen as a canonical text in white nationalist circles.
"The power of the book comes from the very vivid images of near destruction of the white race, and the absence of resistance from the government," said Cécile Alduy, a professor of French studies at Stanford University who has studied the discourse of the French far right.
Its leader, Marine Le Pen, said "The Camp of the Saints," which she read at 18, "left a great mark on her," and urged French people to read it to understand what she described as the country's "migratory submersion." Steve Bannon claimed that European countries had been confronted with an "invasion" similar to the one described in "The Camp of the Saints." Iowa Representative Steve King argued that the book's story "should be imprinted into everyone's brain."
In the United States, Beirich said the book stood alongside "The Turner Diaries," a race war novel by William Pierce, former head of the neo-Nazi group the National Alliance, as the top fictional references for white supremacists. The recognition of the place held by "The Camp of the Saints" in such circles may have reached a new high last week, when it was revealed that Miller, President Trump's influential immigration adviser, had cited it.
In September 2015, while European countries struggled with an immigration crisis, Miller encouraged Breitbart editors to write about Raspail's book. Three weeks later, the conservative website ran a story noting that, like in the novel, contemporary Western leaders were "urging on ever larger waves" of immigration, and may well be "unable to erect walls."
"The Trump administration's anti-immigration policy is a direct consequence of taking 'Camp of the Saints' as a blue book for governing," Alduy said.
The migrants in "The Camp of the Saints" are portrayed as diseased people who eat human feces -- the group's leader is nicknamed "turd eater" -- and their arrival is described as an "endless cascade of human flesh" clambering ashore like an "anthill slashed open."
Now 94 and a well-traveled monarchist, Raspail seems an unlikely hero to the Americans for whom "globalist" is an insult. Indeed, when "The Camp of the Saints" was published, few could have predicted that the book would have such a wide-ranging afterlife.
The title is taken from the Book of Revelation in the Bible, a reference to the army gathered by Satan who overrun the earth, including the camp of the saints. Raspail drew on his experience documenting endangered communities in Latin America and elsewhere to imagine what waves of outsiders would mean for France's culture, language and population.
"The Camp of the Saints" was translated into several European languages but was hardly a runaway hit. It was published as a hardcover in the United States in 1975 by Scribner and in a paperback edition two years later. A 1975 New York Times review described reading it as "like being trapped at a cocktail party with a normal‐looking fellow who suddenly starts a perfervid racist diatribe."
The reclusive heiress Cordelia Scaife May, who used her fortune to bankroll the anti-immigration movement, gave $ 5,000 through her Laurel Foundation in 1983 to a group called the Institute for Western Values to distribute the English translation of the book in the United States. The Social Contract Press, founded by John Tanton, the architect of the modern American anti-immigration movement, published an English edition and still sells it online.
The publisher's note to the Social Contract edition explains how, unlike in a work of nonfiction, "storytellers can advance notions prohibited to others," predicting that the book could "become the '1984' of the twenty-first century," referencing the famous George Orwell novel about totalitarianism.
Raspail's book helped inspire "The Great Replacement," the idea that white populations of Western countries could soon be supplanted by newer arrivals. Another French writer, Renaud Camus, developed the theory, which has become increasingly popular in white supremacist circles over recent years.
The man accused of killing 51 people in attacks at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, earlier this year, titled his manifesto "The Great Replacement." It was also cited by the shooter at a Walmart in El Paso, Tex.
Although he has acknowledged that his book was "dangerous," Raspail has said in recent years that we would not withdraw a single line. He has claimed that the invasion in "The Camp of the Saints" was an accelerated version of what he called the "infiltration" faced by France over the past several decades.
In France, a new edition published in 2011 became a best seller. The book was published for the first time in Dutch in 2015. That same year a right-wing press republished it in German.
Camus, of the French Institute for International and Strategic Affairs, said Raspail attracted hundreds of fans at an October book signing in Paris for his latest novel, adding, "Those who are obsessed with decadence do like prophets a lot."

34 killed amid floods, mudslides
NAIROBI — Kenya's interior minister says 29 people have been killed in mudslides, among the 34 people overall who lost their lives Saturday amid flooding in the East Africa nation. Heavy rains unleashed overnight floods in western Kenya. Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiangi said 17 people died in a mudslide in the village of Takmal in the Pokot Central district, while 12 others lost their lives in mudslides in the villages of Parua and Tapach in Pokot South. Five other people died when their car was swept away. Matiangi said the government sent military and police helicopters to help, but the scope of the disaster was not yet clear. (AP)
England
2 sentenced for hiding treasure
LONDON — Two men from Wales were sentenced Friday for failing to follow Britain's rules on reporting discoveries of treasure. George Powell, 38, and Layton Davies, 51, dug up a Viking hoard of gold and silver in 2015 in a field in Eye in western England. Instead of reporting it, as required by law, the two hid some of the items, estimated to be worth millions of pounds, and sold others to dealers. Powell received a total term of 10 years, and Davies was sentenced to 8½ years. The judge told Powell and Davies that the “irony in the case" was that if they had followed the correct procedure, they might have been in line to receive up to half the value between them, the BBC reported. “But you wanted more," the judge told them.

Texto completo: My Mom died Tuesday. As much as I admire her 92 years of life, I remember as a kid thinking life had cheated her at times.
Lois Evaughn Schembs was born on a farm outside of Remington, Indiana, on Jan. 28, 1927, to farmer Jesse Schembs and his wife, Floretta Casey. Mom never said they were poor, but she did tell stories of running to the outhouse in the middle of winter nights and being happy to find a Sears catalog instead of just corn cobs. She’d heat an iron in the fire and use it to warm her bed sheets, but she’d still wake up some mornings to find the water frozen in her glass next to the bed.
She was so smart as a child, she skipped second grade. Then she got scarlet fever and missed so much school, she had to repeat third grade. Good in math and English, she was salutatorian of her Class of 1945 at Remington High School, where she also played the drums.
Of course, old classmates of hers just called her "the prettiest girl in school." They say she should have been queen of the Fountain Park Chautauqua in Remington, but the judges declared it a tie and Mom lost the coin flip.
Second in her class. Second to the queen. And second-class citizen when it came to education, I thought. College was never an option for her, so she took a job in bookkeeping with Sherman White and Co., a buyer of farm goods in Goodland. That’s where she met my dad, Willy Constable, on the day he came home from World War II and stopped by in uniform to see his sister, who introduced him to my mom. He was more than 10 years older, and Mom remembers being mortified when he wore his fedora on their first date to the movie theater, as if he were an old man.
Dad proposed on their third date. Three years later, Mom accepted. But first, she and her younger sister, Dorothy, crossed the Atlantic Ocean in the steerage compartment of a steamship for a grand adventure in Ireland. That took courage. Mom came home and married my dad on March 13, 1950, on what happened to be the first day in weeks that it was too wet for farmers to work. The last-second nuptials meant Willy’s father, Bert, skipped the wedding to attend his previously scheduled town board meeting. A rainy spring extended my parent’s honeymoon.
Mom gave birth to daughters Sally and Nancy, and then me and my brother, Bill. Mom insisted that all of us kids learn to play piano and sing alongside Dad and her in the choir at the Goodland Presbyterian Church. My sisters played organ and piano for church and countless weddings. My brother became a gifted musician and keyboard player who charmed crowds with his music. As the only person in my family who never got paid to perform music, I might be the only kid in history whose mother asked him to stop taking piano lessons. We both thought that was a good idea.
Mom and Dad were key members of the South Newton High School Production Company and got all of us kids interested in theater. They took us to Christmas concerts at Purdue University. They also had good seats for Boilermaker football games, where we’d wrap our feet in plastic bread wrappers to keep warm and Mom would open her stash of homemade chocolate-chip goodies only when our team needed her "third-down cookies." Her only attempt at athletics was standing on her head on her birthdays.
Mom quizzed us on current events and political news at supper and set up an Electoral College voting system for family decisions, with everybody getting votes depending on age. A parental bloc defeated any move by the minority children, but any split opened the door for new alliances. Mom filled our home with books, music, humor and love.
An avid reader, political junkie and crossword wiz, she used to quote from New York Times stories and talk about writing her own book. "I’d call it ‘Hamburger and Sex,’" she said. "Because I know hamburger, and I need sex to make it sell."
In addition to cooking our meals and running the household, Mom was the driving force in getting all four kids to go to college. But she didn’t just inspire her own kids. She had an uncanny ability to draw people to her and consider her their second mom. People confided in her about sexual issues, drugs, abuse, alcoholism and dreams.
She lived on a farm in a conservative, heavily Republican, all-white community, but became a go-to person for anyone from outside those boundaries. She and Dad visited Jimmy Carter’s church in Plains, Georgia. Mom and her friend Ruthann were once in a photo on the front of The Indianapolis Star talking with Jesse Jackson after they made the trip to hear the civil rights leader speak. Mom donated to Barack Obama, slapped an Obama bumper sticker on her car in 2008, and probably deserves credit for making Indiana a blue state that year. No one so much as teased her.
Once we kids were out of her hair, she focused more on herself. She and her friends had frequent Lunch Bunch outings.
In her 70s, she took art classes and became an accomplished watercolor artist, winning a couple of ribbons and landing one piece in a juried art show.
She got back to her drums, too, playing snare drum in the Newton Jasper Community Band from her early 70s through her late 80s.
Lovely and elegant are words often used in descriptions of her. Always polite, Mom never swore or spoke badly about anyone. She never let us kids say the S-word, whether that meant "stupid" or "shut up."
She cared for the old ladies in the church. She cared for her parents. She cared for my dad before he died in 2003. She cared for my brother before he died in 2010. She cared for others her whole life. My thoughts about what she could have been if she had been given the chance vanished. Life didn’t cheat her of opportunities. It let her forge her own.
She had grace, smarts, love and a wonderful life. And we were lucky to be part of it.

Brodi Ashton: The day an internal organ turned on me

Texto completo: Recently, I spent six days in the hospital. It all started with stomach pain in the emergency room and quickly turned into pancreatitis. (This is a condition where your pancreas packs its bags, waves goodbye, turns cannibal and uses its own enzymes to devour itself.) If you’ve never experienced pancreatitis, my advice is… don’t. And if you want to know what it feels like, have a baby. And if you want to know what that feels like, well, go impale yourself, all the while breathing regularly and making comments about how beautiful the process is.
Suffice to say, by the time they admitted me, I was doubled over, my heart rate was sky high, and I’m pretty sure sweat was dripping off my face. That’s when a nurse said, “Have I admitted you before?”
Me (grunting): “No.”
Her: “Are you sure? You look very familiar.”
Me (grunting): “I’m sure I’d remember being admitted before.”
Her (revelation hitting): “Oh, I know how I know you! You write for The Tribune.”
This was an unfortunate time to be recognized, since I’m sure I looked like a grunting pile of sweaty goo, and there’s a good chance my hands were frozen in two permanent birds. (That said, love you, Trib readers!)
My stay didn’t start out smoothly. I was in my room for less than an hour when a friend, in an effort to adjust the room temperature, accidentally pulled the lever that called a code blue, which indicates that a patient is in cardiac arrest, and the entire hospital staff is supposed to rush in to save the day.
We apologized profusely, and we were lucky that they actually took the time to show us morons where the thermostat was. No offense to my friend, but I have to say: The thermostat looked like a thermostat, and the code blue lever definitely looked like something we shouldn’t touch.
For the next few days, I was not allowed to eat or drink anything. My mouth was like the Sahara Desert, except drier. At the same time, they were pumping me full of fluid. This led to an incredible swelling of my body and my face. One friend said it was like looking at Jabba the Hutt wearing a blond wig. She said my double chin was only being held up by my ginormous stomach. I love her dearly.
On the third day, they said I could have some ice chips. I got a large cup of ice chips and proceeded to shovel them into my mouth with a spoon. I quickly asked for more, and the nurse (we’ll call him Fred) said, “You already went through all those ice chips?”
Me: “Yes, I was hungry.”
Fred: “Ice chips are to be used to wet your mouth and melt slowly.”
Me: “Perhaps you should’ve been more specific in your instructions.”
That’s when I lost ice chip privileges.
By day four, my IV was a little bit of a mess. I asked the nurses to redress it, but they were wary about disrupting a very good IV and vein. I begged them to redress it. They did, carefully maneuvering around the needle and the tubing. The second they were done, I thanked them, and then reached down to grab my phone. My tube got caught on the bed lever and when I turned back, my brand new IV popped out, blood and fluid rushing everywhere.
I apologized again as they put a new IV in my other arm.
By day five, there was a new concern. To put it politely, my digestive tract wasn’t doing its business. This was due to the pain medication. So, the doc gave me something that would hopefully jumpstart my system.
I had made friends with the staff, and at one point the housekeeper (we’ll call her Stella) was in my room lamenting about her ex-husband. We were really getting into a deep conversation about midlife crises when my intestines raised their hands and said: “Hey, remember us? The strike is over. We’re ready to work again.”
But Stella was in the middle of some soul-searching information.
I tried to tell my intestines to take five, but they weren’t having it. So I interrupted Stella by pointing to my stomach and exclaiming, “Thundercats are a go!!”
By day six, my pain was under control, I was back on solid food, I was off my IV pain meds, and it was time for me to click my heels and go home. I wouldn’t say I was anxious, but I was unhooked, dressed and made the Kessel Run in less than 12 parsecs.
In a way, I’ll miss the third floor, and the awesome day nurses and the unflappable night nurses and the observant doctors and the gift shop operator who always asked me if I had staged a jailbreak every time I visited her in my hospital garb, towing my IV machine.
But Stella, I think I’ll miss you most of all.
And I hope to never see any of you ever again. Needless to say, I’m sure the feeling is mutual.

Texto completo: July 2019. The White House — 3 a.m. Donald Trump tosses and turns.
MELANIA: What’s wrong, Donald?
TRUMP: I can’t sleep.
MELANIA: (Turns the lamp on.) Why, what’s bothering you? You can tell me.
TRUMP: No, no. I don’t want to bother you with my problems.
MELANIA: Donald, I’m your wife. You can tell me anything.
TRUMP: OK … The truth is, I just can’t stop thinking about corruption in Ukraine.
MELANIA: Oh, honey.
TRUMP: It’s killing me. I can’t eat. I can’t sleep.
MELANIA: Maybe you should take a Xanax.
TRUMP: I took two. It did nothing. The thing is, Melania, it’s just so difficult for some of these post-Soviet countries to set up a functioning democracy, and corruption is at the root of that. It’s endemic. These poor people who lived under the yoke of Communism for so long are thirsting for genuine democracy and. … (He wells up.)
MELANIA: What, honey? What is it? Tell me.
TRUMP: I just need a second. (Melania hands him a tissue.) Thanks, I’ll be O.K. I just feel so deeply for them. They’re a brave, decent, honest people. They deserve so much more than they’re getting. It’s such a shame. I’ll tell you one thing — I’d like to get my hands on some of those crooks! That Zlochevsky — I don’t know what I’d do to him. You know I fought in the Golden Gloves? I could’ve been a professional boxer. I had many offers. Many.
MELANIA: I didn’t know that.
TRUMP: Oh, yeah. My fights would be over so fast, I wouldn’t even break a sweat. Didn’t even take a shower. Sometimes my opponent would beg me to stop: “Please, please! Don’t hit me anymore!”
MELANIA: I would’ve liked to have seen that.
TRUMP: Unfortunately, none of it’s on video.
MELANIA: Yes, that is unfortunate. But Donald, listen to me. You can’t keep going on like this.
TRUMP: I know. The whole thing sickens me. Honestly, I’m nauseous. And Ukraine has so many other problems. I just want to do everything possible to help the Ukrainians. But how can I if there’s rampant corruption? I can’t! I can’t! (He slams his hand on the nightstand.)
MELANIA: Donald, don’t! You’re going to drive yourself crazy. You’ve got too many important things to think about here. Besides, that’s Ukraine. It’s a foreign country thousands of miles away.
TRUMP: That doesn’t mean they’re not entitled to good governance, to the best that man has to offer. It doesn’t matter what country, or where it is — everyone’s entitled to expect more from their leaders. But this corruption — it’s shameful. Shameful.
MELANIA: There must be something you can do. After all, you’re president of the United States. You’re the most powerful person in the world.
TRUMP: Yes, but this is an internal matter. I can’t just tell their president what to do.
MELANIA: You know, he used to be a comedian.
TRUMP: Yeah. I’m so much funnier than he is. You’ve seen the rallies. How funny am I? I get tremendous laughs. And I’m doing it off the cuff. It’s not “material.” None of these comedians can do that. Seinfeld. Chappelle. Rock. Theirs is all written. I’m improvising. I’m raw.
MELANIA: Maybe that’s something you should think about doing when you get out of office.
TRUMP: You know what, not the worst idea I ever heard. I like it. … (Gets an idea.) Oh my God!
MELANIA: What?
TRUMP: I got it. Listen. Ukraine needs military aid to fight the Russians, and I was going to give it to them. I was going to give them so much aid, they’d be thanking me for the next 20 years. They’d rename the capital after me. I wouldn’t even be able to enter the country because they’d be draped all over my car. It would be adulation like you’d never seen because of this military aid package. I’m telling you, it’s bigger than the Marshall Plan. It’s a beautiful package.
MELANIA: O.K. What’s the idea?
TRUMP: Suppose I make the military aid contingent on them rooting out all corruption?
MELANIA: Donald! How fabulous!
TRUMP: Fabulous, right?
MELANIA: Are you sure that’s legal?
TRUMP: Of course it’s legal. I’m going to get rid of corruption in Ukraine! How could anyone possibly object to that? And by the way, even if someone does object, I don’t care. I’m doing something great for that country.
MELANIA: It sounds great.
TRUMP: You know what? I feel better. I knew I’d eventually figure out a solution. You know what I am?
MELANIA: A genius?
TRUMP: A stable genius. A very stable genius.
MELANIA: Goodnight, honey. This might be the most perfect plan you’ve ever had.
TRUMP: Yes, it’s perfect.
MELANIA: (Turns out the light.) I’m so proud of you.
TRUMP: So am I.

Texto completo: The illegal wildlife trade in Vietnam has depleted some forests so drastically that scientists call the result “empty forest syndrome,” where almost nothing sings or crawls or rustles the branches.
“There’s a beautiful, vibrant tropical forest around you, but no animals in it,” said Andrew Tilker, a scientist with Global Wildlife Conservation and doctoral student at the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research in Berlin. “It’s an eerie feeling.”
Within this emptiness, Tilker and a team of researchers went looking for a small, deerlike mammal called the silver-backed chevrotain, which scientists had not seen any evidence of in nearly 30 years. But, the team reported last week in Nature Ecology & Evolution, there is at least one pocket of forest where the mammal is alive and well, for now.
With its Search for Lost Species initiative, Global Wildlife Conservation aims to highlight species, like the silver-backed chevrotain, that are “lost” to science but not necessarily extinct. Scientists have recorded only five silver-backed chevrotain specimens. All of them were already dead. The first four appeared in 1910, and the final specimen, killed by a hunter, turned up in 1990.
Researchers had no reason to think the silver-backed chevrotain had gone extinct. But the researchers also had no idea where to find the animal.
In March 2017, members of the research team brainstormed about where to look for the silver-backed chevrotain. They focused on dry coastal forest in the southern part of Vietnam, near where the first specimens turned up more than a century earlier. It’s a very different habitat from the wet evergreen forests that are common across the country, Tilker says, but other research in those forests hadn’t turned up any silver-backed chevrotains. “We thought, hey, why don’t we go somewhere different?”
Next, Vietnamese team members interviewed local residents about whether they had seen any silver-backed chevrotains in the forest. It was a delicate question, Tilker said, because the wire-snare hunting that has emptied Vietnamese forests is illegal. Most of it supplies a thriving illegal wildlife trade, with much of the meat ending up in restaurants. Some of the people who could best answer the scientists’ questions were hunters and traders.
An Nguyen, also a Global Wildlife Conservation scientist and a Leibniz Institute doctoral student, led the interviews. Researchers started with simple questions about people’s lives to get them comfortable, Nguyen said, and then asked about wildlife in the forest. Had they seen the little deerlike animal with a pointed face, tawny fur and a grizzled back?
Everyone interviewed said that chevrotain populations (including the silver-backed as well as another species, the lesser chevrotain) had plummeted in recent years from hunting. But at least nine of the 35 people interviewed said they had seen a silver-backed chevrotain. One person walked researchers into the forest and showed them the exact location. The team used the information to set up camera traps, or motion-activated cameras that snap a burst of photos whenever something walks by.
A few months later, the researchers collected the cameras they had left in the forest and combed through the pictures. In photograph after photograph, there it was: the silver-backed chevrotain. It appeared in daytime, usually alone. The cameras had captured the species on 208 separate occasions.
Nguyen says that after walking through the camera trap sites and seeing footprints and other evidence of mammal life, the pictures didn’t surprise him. Still, they are the first known photos of silver-backed chevrotains alive, and the first scientific evidence of the creature in almost three decades.
The silver-backed chevrotain is one of many species unique to the Annamite Mountains of Vietnam and Laos. Tran Van Bang, a co-author of the study and scientist with the Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology’s Southern Institute of Ecology, said that learning more about these species is important for drawing attention and resources to these threatened forests. To keep the silver-backed chevrotain safe in the immediate future, though, the authors aren’t saying exactly where they put their cameras.
But they may have said too much already, said Diana Bell, a professor of conservation biology at the University of East Anglia whose research team has also worked with elusive wildlife in Vietnam. “I think the most important point it raises is whether authors should in fact be publicizing the rediscovery of a critically endangered species.”
Even though the scientists have hidden the silver-backed chevrotain’s exact location, Bell worries that the publication could increase demand for the animal by hunters.
“It is deeply depressing that conservation biologists should now be placed in this dilemma,” she added.
Tilker agreed that hunting is the most imminent danger to species like the silver-backed chevrotain. Even if the animals remaining in the Vietnamese forests avoid extinction from hunting, they will still face other threats including climate change and habitat destruction. But knowing where some animals are still hiding out is a first step toward keeping them alive.
“Until we find the species and start learning something about it, it’s not possible to do any sort of conservation,” Tilker said. “It’s hard to protect a species if you don’t know if it still exists.”

Texto completo: The angels have left the runway: Victoria's Secret cancels annual fashion show
The angel era is over.
L Brands, the parent company of Victoria's Secret, has officially canceled its annual fashion show after more than two decades of star-studded, glitter-encrusted spectacle. Rumors of cancellation have swirled since May, when chief executive Les Wexner sent a memo to Victoria's Secret employees saying it was time to "rethink" the annual extravaganza, CNBC reported, as network television was no longer "the right fit."
In its broadcast debut in 2001, Victoria's Secret's parade of winged, scantily-clad supermodels drew more than 12 million viewers. But viewership has fallen steadily, as consumers have soured on the brand's narrow representation of female sexuality, which had been historically geared toward male desire. Last year's show had the worst viewership in its broadcast history, drawing 3.3 million viewers according to Nielsen, and on the earnings call, Burgdoerfer indicated that it had been failing to boost the company's falling sales.
"Did we see specific material impact on short-term sales response to the airing of the Fashion Show as a general matter? The answer to that question is no," Burgdoerfer said. He added that it had been "a very important part of the brand-building of this business" but that the company was working to advance the brand's image. L Brands shares are down more than 32 percent this year.
Once credited with transforming lingerie into an everyday item for the average woman, Victoria's Secret has been hemorrhaging customers as many turn to more inclusive, comfort-oriented competitors, like Rihanna's Savage x Fenty and popular startup ThirdLove. Last year's low ratings came after L Brands chief marketing officer Ed Razek said the show shouldn't feature transgender models because it was supposed to be a "fantasy." The longtime architect behind the show, Razek, later apologized. After he retired in August, the company hired its first openly transgender model, Valentina Sampaio.
"Victoria's Secret's brand image is starting to appear to many as being outdated and even a bit 'tone deaf' by failing to be aligned with women's evolving attitudes towards beauty, diversity and inclusion," James A. Mitaronda, head of activist investor Barington Capital Group, wrote in a letter to Wexner in March. "While Victoria's Secret has improved the racial and ethnic diversity of the women in its advertising campaigns, it continues to use models that depict a very narrow definition of beauty."
Wexner and Victoria's Secret have also come under scrutiny for ties to Jeffrey Epstein, who long served as Wexner's personal financial adviser. The New York Times reported that Epstein had tried to pass himself off as a recruiter for Victoria's Secret models. In 1997, Epstein invited a model to his hotel room to audition for the brand's catalog, then attacked her, according to the Times.
At the outset, Victoria's Secret was geared toward male appetites. Founder Roy Raymond got the idea for the company in the mid-1970s after an embarrassing experience in a department store, where he'd gone to buy lingerie for his wife. Raymond envisioned a lingerie store that men would feel comfortable shopping in, choosing the name "Victoria" for the association with Victorian era decorum that could mask "secrets" beneath, Slate reported in 2013. He opened the first store with a $40,000 bank loan and $40,000 borrowed from relatives.
Wexner, already a retail giant, discovered the store in 1982, on a business trip to San Francisco. By then, Raymond had turned it into a chain, but it was struggling, teetering on the edge of bankruptcy.
- The Washington Post
"It was a small store, and it was Victorian - not English Victorian, but brothel Victorian with red velvet sofas," Wexner told Newsweek in 2010. "There wasn't erotic lingerie, but there was very sexy lingerie, and I hadn't seen anything like it in the U.S."
Soon after, Raymond asked him if he'd be interested in purchasing Victoria's Secret, which Wexner did, for about $1 million. Raymond stayed on as president for a year before leaving to open My Child's Destiny, a high-end children's retailer, which went bankrupt within a few years. He committed suicide by jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge in 1993.
Wexner saw Victoria's Secret had been failing because it was unwelcoming to female customers, so he sought to make it more appealing and accessible to a broader customer base. By 1995, Wexner had turned Victoria's Secret into a company worth nearly $2 billion, with more than 650 stores across the country. That year saw the very first Victoria's Secret fashion show, at the Plaza Hotel in New York. It was void of glitter, and there were no wings to be seen.

Texto completo: A guidebook, conversation prompts and analog gadgets to ground you this holiday season, or whenever.
The whirl of holiday activity -- traveling, talking, eating, gifting -- can be dizzying. During the overwhelming moments, I notice that I frequently retreat into the world of my phone. I pull my device from my pocket and tap endlessly through various apps and articles for a brief reprieve, escaping to other places and people's lives for a while. But then, of course, I neglect what's happening in my own. I don't love it.
So this go-round, I'm making an effort to tune in. That means lining up some analog tools that don't have the ability to transport me away so I can focus on the here and now. Even if you don't celebrate, maybe you can relate to feeling F.O.M.O. (the fear of missing out) on other experiences. In collaboration with Wirecutter, a New York Times company that reviews and recommends products, here are five cheap(ish) things I'm using to stay present during the holidays and year-round.
Have a deeper conversation
It's a big part of my job as a journalist to ask questions. But even I burn out on how to lead chats away from talking about my dating life, or from banal small talk. You can ease the pressure of keeping up the conversation with a pack of icebreaker cards, which will come up with the questions for you. I like the Icebreaker Deck cards (bestself.co), which come with 150 prompts. They're color coded by topic, so you can choose whether you want to keep a conversation light or dig a little more. Reviewers say they use these cards for everything from therapy sessions to college workshops to group vacations. Using them may feel a little formal with people you already know, but it's a chance for you to learn more about them.
Play a game
A board game is an easy way to help people share an experience, and there are so many options beyond Monopoly. The best ones are easy to learn and balance interaction, strategy and luck; they might even win over the people who claim to dislike playing. Wirecutter's two favorite party games are Dixit, an interactive card game, and Codenames, a spy-themed word-affiliation game.
Snap an analog photo
As an alternative to using a phone for photos, I love using instant cameras to capture a moment. Wirecutter recommends the Fujifilm Instax Square SQ6, which makes the highest-quality photos of any instant camera, with extra controls if you want to get artsy. The more budget-friendly Fujifilm Instax Mini 9 will also yield tangible souvenirs, it just makes slightly smaller photos with less detail. Although you may start a squabble over who will get to take the photos home, with multiple packs of film you can take doubles to give away.
Don't caption, write
I hate to admit this, but I often mentally sum up an experience or feeling as a potential caption or tweet to post. To check the impulse and raise my chances for self-reflection instead of outside validation, I've started writing down my thoughts on paper instead of broadcasting them before they're fully formed. Wirecutter recommends the stalwart Field Notes Notebooks. They're lightweight and small enough to fit in a pocket, and won't smudge when you're writing. As for writing instruments, Wirecutter recommends the smooth-writing Uni-Ball Jetstream.
Make a plan
Phone addiction is real, so to try breaking my negative patterns that flare during the holidays, I picked up Catherine Price's book "How to Break Up With Your Phone." Her pocket-size book isn't preachy or didactic, although the first section, called "The Wake Up," is meant to scare you into action. Ms. Price nails my habit as "Phoning out," and writes that there isn't anything wrong with doing this occasionally -- as long as it's not a default setting. She offers simple guidelines for a 30-day reset, but they're flexible. If you want to go on your own phone breakup journey before or during the holidays, you can get the book and enlist others to do it with you for support.

Texto completo: It can be done in barely 30 minutes in a hotel room, garage or even an airport lounge. All you need is a jump rope.
How can anybody fit in a simple, quick, full-body workout, anywhere?
"Two words: Jump rope," said Dr. Michael Joyner, an avid exerciser and physiologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.
In his usage, the phrase is both object and action. "I have a beautiful leather boxers' jump rope my mother gave me when I was trying to become a more coordinated high-school basketball player," he said. "When I travel and there is zero equipment, I find a place to do a series of calisthenics and jump rope."
[Need a jump rope? Wirecutter, the product recommendation company owned by The New York Times, has suggestions.]
His regimen follows. It can be done in barely 30 minutes in a hotel room, spare bedroom, garage, porch, park, driveway or airport lounge, if you are uninhibited, he said. He does this in locker rooms during his sons' swim meets.
Ask a family member to cheer and time you and switch places at the end.

Texto completo: Escalating rhetoric reveals how seriously Beijing views the unrest in Hong Kong.
In a week when Hong Kong's universities became tear-gas-scented battlegrounds, the escalating violence has been matched by an intensifying spiral of rhetoric from the governments of Beijing and Hong Kong. Words have always been weapons in conflict, but in the social media age, their potential as tools of mobilization is exponentially multiplied, and the terminology used to describe protesters seems like a signal of tough action ahead.
Language has been key to this protest movement since its beginning. In June, Hong Kong's chief executive, Carrie Lam, characterized a protest against a controversial extradition law as a "riot." That designation -- which echoed a pivotal moment in April 1989 when The People's Daily, the main newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, called a mourning assembly by students in Tiananmen Square "turmoil" -- was met with fury by protesters. They argued that the gathering had been calm until the police responded with tear gas and rubber bullets. That anger helped swell the crowds of marchers to an estimated two million people four days later, with new demands including the retraction of the term "riot."
For the first few months of the Hong Kong protests, China's state media outlets seemed to be drawing upon the 1989-era playbook. They attributed the unrest to mysterious instigators whom they called "black hands," and external hostile forces including the C.I.A.
By August, state media had stepped up the rhetoric, describing the protesters as "violent mobs" and saying the protests showed "signs of terrorism." On Tuesday, a day after students lobbed Molotov cocktails and fired arrows at police officers who had trapped them inside Hong Kong Polytechnic University, China Daily, a state-run English-language newspaper, described Hong Kong's campuses as "fortresses of terrorist activities," and warned of separatists "conspiring with foreign forces" to turn Hong Kong into a "bridgehead to subvert China." Another article carried by the state mouthpiece described protesters' demands for Western-style liberal democracy as a "malignant virus" and an "infection."
Such comparisons reveal how seriously Beijing views the unrest in Hong Kong, which had long been one of the most stable places on China's periphery. In a move that was part public relations exercise and part threat, People's Liberation Army troops that are stationed in the city jogged out of their barracks last weekend to "voluntarily" clean the streets, bearing brooms and plastic buckets. It was only the second time since 1997 that they have been seen on Hong Kong's streets, and it was not lost on Hong Kong's residents that these soldiers were from the top counterterrorism unit, a designation emblazoned on their colorful jerseys.
The mini-constitution that governs Hong Kong, the Basic Law, stipulates that troops can be called out to help with disaster relief if requested by the local government. In this case, no request had been made. Even if the troops remain in the barracks in the future, their presence has now been advertised, and this contributes to the perception of a militarization of Hong Kong's streets, which nightly -- and increasingly by day, too -- teem with regular police officers, riot policemen and members of the elite "Raptor" unit, a specialized riot control task force.
To Chinese readers, mentions of separatism and terrorism invoke Xinjiang, the northwestern province where China is holding an estimated one million members of the Uighur minority in political indoctrination camps. The discourse of pathology is often used in relation to Xinjiang, where Islam is depicted as an ideological illness. One China Daily opinion essay expanded on the comparison, explaining: "The problems of Hong Kong and that of terrorism have similar causes: lack of realistic economic opportunities and misguided ideology. Regarding terrorism, China has shown the world a more effective and humane approach than that pursued by other countries."
According to this logic, a "weakened immune system" is a vulnerability that can be healed only by the education of "corrigible" but misguided youngsters, raising the chilling prospect of some form of Xinjiang-style ideological re-education in Hong Kong. However, an attempt seven years ago to introduce courses in "national and moral education" to Hong Kong failed after mass protests by students.
These disease metaphors underline Beijing's view of Hong Kong's protest movement as a threat to its body politic, with ideological infection posing an existential danger to the Chinese Communist Party. Such discourse could prefigure new restrictions on speech in Hong Kong, a possibility that seems to be inching incrementally closer. An injunction that has been introduced to protect Hong Kong police officers from "doxxing" -- releasing their personal details online -- has been criticized as overly broad, since it also prohibits "harassing, threatening, pestering or interfering" with the police. Such a law could even technically outlaw singing protest songs about the police. More worrying, one adviser to Hong Kong's government has already warned that an internet ban has not been ruled out.
As the arrests in Hong Kong mount, to around 4,500, the language from Ms. Lam, the unpopular chief executive, is hardening as well. In August, she lay the blame for the protests on a small minority with "no stake in society." Two weeks ago, she denounced the "rioters" as "enemies of the people." This phrase, alien in Hong Kong, comes straight from the Communist Party lexicon. Chairman Mao once decreed that "enemies of the people" do not actually belong to the category of people. They are, effectively, nonpeople.
The dehumanization of Hong Kong's protesters has been underway for months. In July, when a pro-Beijing legislator, Junius Ho, complained that his parents' graves had been defaced, a senior police officer, John Tse Chun-cheng, said the vandalism was done not by humans but by "cockroaches." Since then, state media has carried cartoons depicting activists as cockroaches, which has become a term of abuse by the police. A week ago, video emerged on social media of police officers talking about "killing cockroaches." This language -- the rhetoric of genocide -- carries an implicit threat for protesters.
The protesters' language, too, has become much harsher; "dogs" and "triads" -- a reference to Hong Kong's feared criminal syndicates -- are among the few printable epithets used against the police. Cantonese is famously sweary, and profane graffiti now spackles Hong Kong's streets, including provocative terms like "Chinazi," a portmanteau comparing today's China to Nazi Germany.
As the protest movement has widened its focus -- from one specific law to police brutality and Hong Kong's own political future -- its slogans, too, have changed. A subversive rallying call that was once considered a fringe idea has become a clarion call: "Retake Hong Kong, Revolution of Our Times!" The phrase was coined by Edward Leung, a pro-independence politician who is serving a six-year jail sentence for his role in a 2016 street skirmish that became known as the Fishball Revolution. Its meaning is ambiguous, but officials are publicly denouncing it as a challenge to national sovereignty.
But Beijing is not trying to counter the protesters slogan for slogan. Its strategy is much broader. Earlier this year, China harnessed Twitter and Facebook to run state-backed disinformation campaigns, directed mainly at overseas Chinese and Hong Kongers, to frame the protests as a separatist plot aimed at undermining China's territorial integrity. In October, having laid that groundwork for public support, Beijing said that it was planning a "national security" solution in Hong Kong, paired with ideological education. It's unclear how severe those measures will be, butPresident Xi Jinping has warned that anyone attempting to split China will face "crushed bodies and shattered bones." The violence of his language leaves little space for compromise or compassion.

Texto completo: STOCKDALE, Texas - The 300-pound llamas strolled quietly through the corridors of the nursing home, lowering their heads to be petted by residents in wheelchairs and pausing patiently as staffers took selfies.
“Did you get a bath today?” one resident, Jean Wyatt, asked Tic, a white male llama owned by Zoe Rutledge. (He had.)
Zoe, a high school sophomore, was there with her parents, Jeff and Carol Rutledge, who keep 13 llamas and alpacas at their home here in Stockdale, an exurb of San Antonio. Three of their herd have passed the qualifying exam necessary to become registered therapy llamas, a test that involves being touched by strangers and remaining impassive when people nearby start arguing.
“You look for the ones that are mellow and calm,” said Zoe, explaining how her family chose the animals they take to assisted living facilities, nursing and veterans’ homes, rehabilitation centers and walkathons for groups like the Down Syndrome Association of South Texas.
Llamas and alpacas - popular in TV commercials, as toys and on all manner of apparel - are simultaneously growing more common in therapeutic settings. While a handful are registered with Pet Partners, a national nonprofit clearinghouse for therapy animals, most are simply family farm pets whose owners take them to hospitals, college campuses and senior centers to ease people’s stress.
The novelty factor is a big part of the appeal, along with the creatures’ big-eyed, empathetic gaze. Among the animals that biologists refer to as charismatic megafauna - tigers, elephants, giant pandas and the like - llamas, which are not endangered, are among the few that people can safely hug.
“For some people, dogs are a little too much, or they’ve had a bad experience with them,” said Niki Kuklenski, a longtime llama breeder in Bellingham, Washington, who was one of the first to use the animals for therapeutic purposes. She said that her llamas, especially a female named Flight, “will read people. So when she goes into a setting where someone’s really animated and excited to see her, she’ll put her head down for a hug.”
But if someone seems apprehensive, “Flight will stand stock still,” Kuklenski said. “She is very cool.”
Don’t forget llama insurance
At Pet Partners, 94% of the registered therapy animals are dogs, but there are 20 llamas and alpacas in the mix, said Elisabeth Van Every, a spokeswoman for the group. (Most are llamas, which are much larger than alpacas and typically far friendlier to humans.) People who register their animals are covered under Pet Partners’ insurance for the duration of their therapy visits, and must abide by strict rules about health, grooming and working conditions. No animal may work more than two hours a day, and handlers must be aware of any signs of fatigue or annoyance.
Llama owners will tell you that their pets have a sixth sense about people who are needy, ill or frail. Carol Rutledge says that her therapy llama, whose name is Knock, will walk voluntarily to the bedside of a hospice patient and stand in silence while the patient reaches for him. “It wrenches at your heart,” she said. “It’s taken me several visits to be able to get through it without getting emotional.”
Mona Sams, an occupational therapist in Roanoke, Virginia, has eight llamas and five alpacas at her practice, which serves children with autism and other disorders, as well as adults with developmental disabilities. One patient is a girl with severe cerebral palsy and seizures who comes twice a week. “I have one llama” - named Woolly - “who literally sits there with her for a whole hour, face to face,” Sams said. “She calls Woolly her ‘counselor,’ and she will spend the first part of the hour telling Woolly what difficulties she’s had, and he just sits beside her for that entire time.”
Sams is the lead author of what seems to be the only published study involving the use of llamas as therapy animals. The article, published in 2006 in the American Journal of Occupational Therapy, describes a very small clinical trial in which children with autism were given either standard occupational therapy or therapy that involved handling llamas. The results “indicated that the children engaged in significantly greater use of language and significantly social interaction in the occupational therapy sessions incorporating animals than in the standard occupational therapy sessions,” the study authors wrote.
Hal Herzog, an anthrozoologist and professor emeritus of psychology at Western Carolina University, said that such results are not surprising, though they do not prove the efficacy of animal-assisted therapy. He says there’s a big mismatch between what the public believes - or wants to believe - about the effectiveness of therapy animals and what scientific studies show.
“The evidence for the short-term, probably transient, effects of interacting with animals in nursing homes or for autistic kids is quite good - petting a dog, or interacting with a llama, stress levels go down,” Herzog said. “But when we think of therapy, we think about long-term treatment, and I think the evidence for that is mixed.”
In Sams’ llama study, for example, he said, the children who got the standard therapy were doing “boring stuff” compared with the children who got to play with llamas. “I have no objection to that llama study, if it makes the kids feel better for a time, but I wouldn’t call it therapy,” said Herzog, author of the animal ethics book “Some We Love, Some We Hate, Some We Eat.”
He also pointed out that many people who research the human-animal bond are what he calls “true believers,” eager to validate the positive influence of pets and emotional support animals. “As an animal lover myself, I really wanted to believe it, too,” Herzog said, adding that his research led him to a different conclusion.
Not for everyone
Llama therapy is certainly not for everyone. While llamas are gentle creatures that seldom spit at humans, some people find their large stature intimidating or get spooked at seeing livestock indoors. On the flip side, some llamas aren’t cut out for the job: The two notorious runaway llamas that escaped onto a highway near Phoenix in 2015 had bolted from a visit to an assisted-living residence.
When two of the Rutledge family’s three therapy llamas - Tic and Knock - arrived at the Stockdale Residence and Rehabilitation Center for a regular visit, Bill Smallwood, a resident who is disabled from a motorcycle accident, accepted a small hair brush from Zoe and began grooming her llama. Smallwood is nonverbal, she said, but when the llamas are there, he will murmur and make wordlike noises.
This summer, for a science competition for 4-H Club, Zoe compared the blood pressure readings of three of the nursing home’s residents, including Smallwood and Wyatt, before and after the llamas visited. Her hypothesis proved correct: Most of the time, their blood pressure was lower after the llamas left, and, observationally, they seemed happier.
Bobbie West, the nursing home’s activities director, said she kept it secret when the llamas were scheduled to visit, lest staff and residents get too excited. “They love the llamas,” she said. “One lady, she can be in the foulest of moods, and when the llamas come, she just gets a whole new aura to her.”

Texto completo: The claims by an asylum seeker in Australia couldn't be independently verified, but Western officials are treating them seriously.
BEIJING -- A man claiming to be a disillusioned Chinese intelligence operative has told the Australian authorities that China's military intelligence agencies were directly intervening in politics in Hong Kong and Taiwan, buying media coverage, infiltrating universities, funneling donations to favored candidates and creating thousands of social media accounts to attack Taiwan's governing party.
So far, some Western diplomatic officials believe the claims by an asylum seeker named Wang Liqiang to be reliable at least in part, according to two people briefed on the matter. While some of his details appeared speculative and impossible to verify, the officials were taking his claims seriously, the people said.
If verified, his account would be one of the most detailed ever made public of China's covert measures to manipulate politics and public opinion in Hong Kong and Taiwan.
Mr. Wang's account, a 17-page plea for political asylum in Australia, reads in parts like an espionage thriller. He detailed code names of covert operations, shadowy business ventures and ultimately his dawning disenchantment with what he described as China's efforts to stifle democracy and human rights around the world.
"I do not want to see Taiwan becoming a second Hong Kong," he wrote. "And I would not become an accomplice in the conspiracy of turning an originally democratic and free land into autocratic land."
The office of Australia's Minister for Foreign Affairs confirmed receiving Mr. Wang's statement, which was first reported by The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age. An English translation was provided to The New York Times by a person familiar with his request for asylum. The people familiar with Mr. Wang's statement requested anonymity because his allegations are still being investigated.
Mr. Wang's statement surfaced as protests continue to convulse Hong Kong, driven in large part by concerns over the steady encroachment of Communist Party rule despite Beijing's pledge to respect the former British colony's economic and political autonomy.
In his account, Mr. Wang said he was involved with the apprehension by Chinese agents in 2015 of five booksellers in Hong Kong, an incident often cited by demonstrators. He said he received orders "to pay close attention" to one of them, Lee Bo, for his involvement in publishing a gossipy book called "Xi Jinping and His Six Women" that purported to delve into the personal life of China's top leader.
The statement also emerged only weeks before Taiwan's presidential election in January. The campaign has already been shaken by allegations of Chinese interference. The governing party has accused China of supporting the opposition party, the Kuomintang.
"I have to repeat that China is factually interfering in Taiwan's election, and it happens every day," Taiwan's president, Tsai Ing-wen, said on Tuesday as she officially launched a re-election campaign.
Beijing has made no secret of its opposition to Ms. Tsai and her party, the Democratic Progressive Party, which has sought to bolster Taiwan's political and economic independence. Her challenger is Han Kuo-yu, a populist who was last year elected mayor of Kaohsiung, a city in southern Taiwan, and who has promised to improve relations with the mainland.
According to his account, Mr. Wang himself helped funnel campaign donations of roughly $ 2.8 million to Mr. Han in the 2018 elections.
"Now that the 2020 presidential election is approaching, China will be putting much more efforts into it," he wrote.
Chao Chien-min, one of Mr. Han's policy advisers, strongly disputed the accusations.
"How could Han Kuo-yu dare to casually accept 20 million renminbi in unknown money?" he said. "Does he still want to survive in Taiwan's political arena? I believe that is impossible."
Mr. Wang's allegations seem certain to reverberate widely in Taiwan, in Hong Kong and on the mainland. Although China's intelligence operations in Taiwan and Hong Kong have long been presumed to be robust, the statement provided an extraordinary amount of detail.
"We had an inkling this was happening, but we have never had evidence or an insider's account," Adam Ni, a researcher at Macquarie University in Sydney who has been recently working in Taiwan, said in a telephone interview.
With the elections in Taiwan, for example, Mr. Wang described how the separate branches of China's military divided up their labors.
Mr. Wang said intelligence efforts included creating more than 20 media and internet companies to launch "targeted attacks," and spending roughly $ 200 million over an unspecified period to invest in television stations in Taiwan. His statement did not explain how such a large sum of money failed to be noticed or raise alarms.
The disclosures could also further sour relations between China and Australia, which recently passed a law seeking to rein in foreign interference after several wealthy Chinese businessmen tied to Beijing were accused of trying to manipulate Australian politics.
One of those businessmen, Huang Xiangmo, was a successful developer who had his Australian residency canceled in February. According to Mr. Wang's statement, Mr. Huang led a group of Australian state and local lawmakers to visit Hong Kong, where they met with Mr. Wang's boss, a man named Xiang Xin. Mr. Huang, who has previously rejected the claim that he has tried to interfere in Australian politics on behalf of Beijing, could not be reached for comment.
These kinds of connections between Australian lawmakers, Chinese wealth and officials whose Communist Party ties are masked by big business have put much of Australia on edge. Earlier this week, the former head of Australia's main foreign intelligence agency described China's espionage efforts as "insidious."
Mr. Wang described himself as the son of a public servant, but little else is known about him, including his age and hometown. He could not be reached for comment. One clue from his statement is that he studied to be a painter, winning awards in Anhui Province in eastern China.
Seeking a job, he ended up at an investment firm called China Innovation Investment Limited, run by Mr. Xiang. Mr. Wang wrote that the company was in fact a front for an arm of China's Ministry of National Defense to conduct a range of political and economic espionage.
Mr. Xiang, 54, is an owner or top director at more than a dozen Hong Kong companies. Some of the companies are co-owned by his wife, Gong Qing, whose biography includes positions at two government-tied institutions. One of those was the China National Science and Technology Information Center, a military intelligence organization within the People's Liberation Army.
Asked to comment, Mr. Xiang denied any knowledge of Mr. Wang. "I never knew Wang," he wrote in an email.
China Innovation Investments is registered in the Cayman Islands and publicly traded in Hong Kong. The company focuses on both private and public investments related to the "integration of military and civil sectors," according to company documents. Mr. Xiang is the chairman and Ms. Gong is listed as an alternative director.
The operations in Hong Kong Mr. Wang described occurred before the protests erupted. He said he became disillusioned when he was tasked to travel to Taiwan in May to take part in operations related to the coming election. He received a false identity with a South Korean passport and a predated French visa, which was mailed to him from the National University of Defense Technology in Hunan Province.
His wife, also a painter, moved to Australia to study in 2012, he wrote. After visiting her and their child in December 2018, he decided to defect and seek asylum.
It is far from clear that he will receive it.
In 2005, Chen Yonglin, a Chinese consular official, sought asylum, promising to divulge details of China's spy network. The Australian government initially rejected his request, prompting a parliamentary inquiry. It found that he was told the denial was "for reasons of foreign affairs." Mr. Chen's application was later approved.
Mr. Wang suggested he understood that Australia might again need to be persuaded before standing up for a single defector. He condemned China's autocratic ways, expressing his "resolute opposition to the actions imposed by the Communist Party of China that trample on democracy, human rights and freedom."
"If I return to the place under their control," he added, "I will surely be killed for disclosing the secrets because I know too much."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz is expected to allege in a voluminous report that a former FBI lawyer altered a document related to the surveillance of a Trump campaign aide, according to people familiar with the matter.
But Horowitz is expected to conclude that the lawyer's conduct did not change the legal basis for the request to wiretap Carter Page, a former foreign policy adviser to President Donald Trump's campaign, one of the sources said.
The long-awaited review is set for release on Dec. 9. Horowitz is scheduled to testify about his findings before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Dec. 11.
Among the most politically charged areas of the review is whether the FBI abused its surveillance authority due to bias against the president. While the report is expected to be sharply critical of the bureau, The New York Times reported Friday that the inspector general is not expected to conclude that top FBI leaders acted out of bias.
Anticipation of the report has long animated Trump and his Republican allies. The president has repeatedly asserted that the inquiry into Russia's interference in the 2016 election was a "witch hunt" orchestrated by political enemies.
In a Friday morning interview on "Fox and Friends," Trump kept up the attack, accusing the FBI of "spying on my campaign. "
"We're dealing at the highest levels of government," the president said following reports of the FBI lawyer's alleged conduct, first reported by CNN.
Horowitz's report will be made public amid a fast-moving impeachment inquiry into allegations that Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine in order to pressure its government to open an investigation into the family of Democratic rival and former Vice President Joe Biden.
And it comes amid criticism from Democrats that the Justice Department, under Attorney General William Barr, has become a tool against the president's political enemies.
Release of the inspector general's report follows revelations last month that a related – and equally politically charged – examination of the origins of the Russia investigation has shifted to a criminal probe.
The allegation against the former FBI lawyer is at least part of the reason for that change, according to a person familiar with the matter.
The FBI and the inspector general's office declined to comment.
Russia probe: DOJ inquiry into origins of investigation has shifted to criminal probe
Spying, treason and politics: President Trump ups the stakes in Russia probe battle despite scant evidence
What Horowitz looked at
The inspector general's review centered on the FBI's surveillance of Page during the early stages of its investigation into Russian interference and possible ties to the Trump campaign.
Horowitz launched his review in March 2018 in response to requests from lawmakers and then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions. The inspector general looked into whether the FBI violated the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, when it sought a judge's permission to wiretap Page.
Page, who had longstanding connections to Russia, admitted meeting with Kremlin officials in July 2016, when he was the Trump campaign's foreign policy adviser.
Horowitz also examined the FBI's relationship and communication with Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence officer. He was hired by a research firm working for the campaign of then-Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, and he compiled a now-infamous "dossier" alleging links between Russia and the Trump campaign.
Republicans have complained that the FBI, in its applications to seek and renew surveillance on Page, concealed its reliance on Steele's findings. But copies of those applications released after USA TODAY and others sued showed FBI investigators did disclose to judges that Steele sought information to "discredit" Trump, and investigators had broader suspicions about Page's ties to the Russian government.
The counterintelligence investigation was launched in the summer of 2016, after the FBI learned that another campaign aide, George Papadopoulos, boasted to an Australian diplomat that Russia had offered the Trump campaign damaging information about Clinton.
Investigators also determined that Russian intelligence had stolen troves of emails from the Democratic National Committee. Papadopoulos' boast came before the Russian intrusions were publicly known.

Mueller concluded Russians interfered in 2016 election
Special Counsel Robert Mueller took over the FBI's investigation in May 2017 and indicted three dozen individuals and entities, including six former Trump associates and campaign aides -- all of whom have either pleaded guilty or been convicted by a jury.
Mueller's report detailed a "sweeping and systematic" effort by the Russian government to intercede in the election to help Trump win, but concluded neither the president nor his campaign conspired with Russians. The report, however, portrayed the campaign as an eager beneficiary of Russian efforts.
In April, shortly before the Justice Department released a redacted version of Mueller's report, Barr told lawmakers he would conduct a separate examination of how the Russia investigation began and whether the government improperly "spied" on the Trump campaign.
Barr's announcement came amid Trump's escalating battle against the law enforcement and intelligence agencies that investigated him and his campaign.
The president and his allies have long alleged that FBI officials were biased against him and spied on his campaign to damage him politically. Trump has also accused law enforcement and intelligence officials of treason.
Barr tapped Connecticut U. S. Attorney John Durham to lead that inquiry. Durham has led high-profile special investigations, such as an examination of the FBI's handling of criminal informants in Boston during the Clinton administration.
Barr has personally overseen the inquiry, seeking assistance from law enforcement partners around the globe.
Former officials dismiss spying claims
Former law enforcement officials have dismissed accusations of spying and treason, saying the surveillance of Page wasn't unusual.
"There was no conspiracy to unseat Mr. Trump or defeat him. There was no treason. There was no sedition," James Baker said in May. He's the FBI's former general counsel and oversaw the launch of the Russia investigation.
Carter Page: Who is he and why is he at the center of the Nunes memo?
Former FBI director James Comey has echoed this sentiment. In a Washington Post op-ed, he wrote that the FBI properly investigated whether Americans associated with the Trump campaign conspired with Russians.
In a separate report released in August, the inspector general concluded that Comey, whom Trump abruptly fired two years ago, broke Justice Department policy by disclosing the contents of confidential memos detailing his interactions with Trump.
Last year, Horowitz released a scathing review of the FBI investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server when she was secretary of state.
The 568-page report rebuked Comey's handling of the investigation and acknowledged "troubling" text messages between two former FBI officials that disparaged Trump, then a presidential candidate. But Horowitz said his examination did not find evidence that political bias affected the investigators' actions.

Texto completo: Ballard Partners – the lobbying firm headed by top Tallahassee and Washington influencer Brian Ballard – and others in President Donald Trump's fundraising network have been subpoenaed as part of an investigation of associates of Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, the New York Times reported Wednesday.
The Ballard firm isn't alone: "FBI agents have knocked on the doors of others involved with Republican campaigns," CNN also reported Wednesday.
Sources told CNN subpoenas were sent to Paul Okoloko, "an executive with a Nigerian fertilizer company who lives in Florida," and Meredith O'Rourke, "a prominent Florida GOP fundraiser who worked with the Trump Victory Fund." Neither one has publicly confirmed they had received the subpoenas.
"There is no indication that those who have received subpoenas or agreed to provide documents or interviews are suspected of wrongdoing," the Times reported.
Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, Soviet-born Florida businessmen and American citizens, "helped Giuliani wage a pressure campaign on Ukraine that is now at the center of the impeachment inquiry" into President Trump, the Times reported.
Parnas and Fruman – who tried insinuating themselves into GOP Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' inner circle – are charged with violating federal campaign finance laws in an unrelated matter; they have pleaded not guilty.
Ballard Partners, headquartered in Tallahassee with offices throughout the state and in Washington, D.C., last year paid Parnas "at least $22,500 for referring business from the Turkish government," according to the Times. The firm has had no dealings with either man since.
Requests for comment from tallahassee.com were pending Thursday morning with Ballard and William W. Taylor III, the firm's Washington-based lawyer.
Taylor confirmed to the Times that Parnas had referred the Turkish government to Ballard for lobbying services.
The attorney said in a statement to the paper: "Ballard Partners is cooperating with a United States Attorney's office for the Southern District of New York investigation. It has received a subpoena and is complying."
Ballard, dubbed "the most powerful lobbyist in Trump's Washington" earlier this year by Politico, spent decades building relationships and business in Florida. The firm now is in its namesake Ballard building, a new multi-million dollar tower in downtown Tallahassee, on the corner of Park Avenue and South Monroe Street.
After Ballard's fundraising support of Trump, his firm now handles national and international clients. Lobbying records show, for example, the Turkish government had agreed to pay Ballard Partners "$1.5 million over a year in May 2017, and renewed its contract for $750,000 a year later," the Times reported.

Photographer Brigitte Lacombe Portrays Celebrities and Journalists Equally

Artists like Brigitte Lacombe are rare: people who exude the sort of ease that infects their subjects and floats recognizably through their work. Lacombe’s fluid intimacy is present in all of the portraits she’s produced in her long, extraordinary photography career; a career that’s involved everything from snapping Nelson Mandela and Louise Bourgeois to capturing the behind-the-scenes action on The Wolf of Wall Street . Lacombe’s upcoming book, Forward: 20 Years of TimesTalks , will offer portraits to commemorate the twenty years of photos she’s taken for TimesTalks, the New York Times interview series. On Monday, Observer spoke to Lacombe about politics, her favorite portrait subjects and the importance of cultivating good vibes on set.
Observer: What sort of environment do you like to create when taking photographs? Emotionally, intellectually, how do you like people to feel?
Lacombe: Well, my work is very classic and simple. For the book, I had decided to do two portraits. One was shot on film with a medium format camera square, and all these portraits were done in daylight on one side of my studio. The other side of my studio was set up as a very simple studio with a strobe light, and that’s where we shot pictures that were maybe full length or three quarters and of course, there’s movement.
A lot of the time I photographed people on both sides so that I could produce two portraits that were very different. And then in the process of working on the design and layout and sequencing of the book, some felt stronger with only one image and some felt stronger with two images. And also, it’s close to seventy portraits, so it does not become monotonous. It’s a very beautiful but very simple and spare studio that is all daylight, overlooking a park and it’s very intimate. I ask people to come by themselves, there was no hair and makeup and people just came as they wanted to be.
I think it comes across in the images themselves; they have that quality. Whether it’s Ava DuVernay smiling or Joan Didion giggling, it’s these incredible artists with formidable and earned intellectual reputations. But your photos give them that playful element.
Good, I’m so glad you feel it comes through because that is what I’m looking for.
In terms of this book particularly, who were some of your favorite figures to photograph?
What’s most interesting to me is there’s a mix of personalities that I’m very familiar with, people that I know very well who are performers and artists. But the most interesting part of the project to me was the journalists, and since the beginning of the project, I’ve always thought that they would be portrayed and featured exactly on par with the personalities. So you have Dean Baquet, you have Maggie Haberman, you have Frank Bruni, you have Peter Baker, you have all the top journalists of the New York Times . You have all these extraordinary journalists, and they are pictured in exactly the same way as the personalities that they did interviews with.
Why was it important for you to do that?
Why, because that’s what the New York Times is. I mean, the New York Times is definitely about the excellence of the journalists and to me, that was what makes them stand apart. Many people are doing books about personalities, but what was interesting was to treat the journalists exactly like the personalities because they are equally, in my eyes, equally if not more important a lot of times than that personalities that are portrayed. So, to get everybody on an equal footing was what the interest of the book was for me.
That is interesting, and could even be read as political, especially at a time when journalists and the press are under such consistent attack. Did you see it that way?
Exactly, that’s a really important part of it, to recognize and honor all these journalists. And it’s interesting, the few people that have seen the book were all—I mean, of course, it idolizes a certain group of people who are passionate about the news, but everybody was really interested. They said ‘oh, that’s what Frank Bruni looks like’ or ‘oh, that’s what Maggie Haberman looks like.’ That’s exactly what I was looking for. It was the most important part of the book for me.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Un exfuncionario de la Agencia Central de Inteligencia (CIA) que pudo haber devastado la recopilación de inteligencia de Estados Unidos en China al entregar a su red de informantes a Pekín fue sentenciado el viernes a 19 años de prisión.
Jerry Chun Shing Lee, un ciudadano estadounidense naturalizado que trabajó para la de 1994 a 2007, fue arrestado en enero de 2018 por poseer ilegalmente información clasificada de defensa estadounidense, que según los fiscales, entregó a los agentes de inteligencia chinos.
“Lee traicionó a su propio país por codicia y puso en riesgo a sus antiguos colegas”, dijo Timothy Slater, subdirector de la oficina de campo del FBI en Washington. “La seriedad de su traición y crimen se demuestra con la sentencia de hoy”, indicó.
La acusación asegura que Lee se mudó a Hong Kong en 2010 y comenzó a aceptar pagos de agentes chinos que le pidieron información confidencial sobre la CIA.
Pero en mayo pasado, Lee, de 55 años, se declaró culpable de un cargo de conspiración por entregar información de defensa nacional para ayudar a un gobierno extranjero, al tiempo que insistió en que el gobierno nunca probó que dio información a los chinos ni que haya aceptado $840,000 dólares de Pekín, como se alega.
El caso ha generado mucha especulación sobre lo que realmente hay debajo, porque le tomó al gobierno seis años desde la primera investigación de Lee hasta su arresto.
Informes de medios de prensa lo vincularon con la destrucción catastrófica de la red de informantes de la CIA en China entre 2010 y 2012.
El New York Times informó en 2017 que los chinos mataron a “al menos una docena” de fuentes que la CIA tenía dentro de China y encarcelaron al menos a otras seis.

Texto completo: Our guide to plays and musicals coming to New York stages and a few last-chance picks of shows that are about to close. Our reviews of open shows are at nytimes.com/reviews/theater .
Previews & Openings
'A BRIGHT ROOM CALLED DAY' at the Public Theater (in previews; opens on Nov. 25). Another fantasia on national themes, Tony Kushner's time-vaulting play returns to the Public. The original drew parallels between the Weimar Republic and Reagan-era America. This new version wrenches the action toward the present. Under Oskar Eustis's direction, Nikki M. James, Crystal Lucas-Perry and Jonathan Hadary star.
212-967-7555, publictheater.org
'FEFU AND HER FRIENDS' at the Polonsky Shakespeare Center (in previews; opens on Nov. 24). After a four-decade absence, María Irene Fornés's lapidary comedy-drama, an early example of a promenade play, returns Off Broadway. At a country house, in 1935, eight women gather to discuss love, violence, gender and philosophy. Lileana Blain-Cruz directs a cast that includes Amelia Workman and Jennifer Lim.
866-811-4111, tfana.org
'MEASURE FOR MEASURE' at the Public Theater (in previews; opens on Nov. 22). The Public's Mobile Unit has been solving Shakespeare's political problem play at correctional facilities, homeless shelters and community centers throughout the five boroughs. The production, directed by LA Williams, now returns to the theater with a reminder that lawmakers may place their own interests above the commonweal.
212-967-7555, publictheater.org
'SING STREET' at New York Theater Workshop (previews start on Nov. 25; opens on Dec. 16). John Carney's 2016 movie, which A. O. Scott described as "an autobiographical tribute to Dublin, hair gel and the power of lip-syncing," arrives Off Broadway. The playwright Enda Walsh, who also adapted Carney's "Once," joins the director Rebecca Taichman and the choreographer Sonya Tayeh for this story of a boy, a girl and a band.

'THE THIN PLACE' at Playwrights Horizons (previews start on Nov. 22; opens on Dec. 12). The playwright Lucas Hnath ("Hillary and Clinton," "The Christians," "A Doll's House, Part 2") has a taste for alternative realities. This new play, directed by Les Waters, is about a medium (Randy Danson) and a young woman (Emily Cass McDonnell) who may have some extrasensory perceptions, too.

'THE YOUNG MAN FROM ATLANTA' at the Pershing Square Signature Center (in previews; opens on Nov. 24). The Signature Theater Company revives Horton Foote's late masterwork about a couple grieving their adult son's death. Reviewing the original Signature production in 1995, Vincent Canby called it "tough, one of Mr. Foote's most serious and scathing works." Kristine Nielsen, Aidan Quinn and Stephen Payne star. Michael Wilson directs.

Last Chance
'DR. RIDE'S AMERICAN BEACH HOUSE' at Ars Nova at Greenwich House (closes on Nov. 23). This new play about women on a rooftop on the evening before Sally Ride's 1983 spaceflight ceases its orbit. "I couldn't stop grinning," Jesse Green wrote, "partly because Liza Birkenmeier's play is so witty and partly because it's so weird." Katie Brook directs a cast that includes Marga Gomez, Erin Markey and Kristen Sieh.

'THE GREAT SOCIETY' at the Vivian Beaumont Theater (closes on Nov. 30). The second of Robert Schenkkan's plays about the presidency of Lyndon B. Johnson ends its term. Directed by Bill Rauch and starring Brian Cox, the drama incorporates Johnson's high and low moments, but it doesn't do much more. "A play that doesn't dramatize a man's interior landscape is just a pageant," Jesse Green wrote.

'THE HEIGHT OF THE STORM' at the Samuel J. Friedman Theater (closes on Nov. 24). Florian Zeller's drama about a couple, long married and possibly dead, divorces itself from Broadway. Jesse Green wrote that Zeller's "idée fixe about unfixed consciousness gets its fullest and least rewarding workout." Still, he praised the play's stars, Jonathan Pryce and Eileen Atkins, "who face the adversity of the text in contrastingly and compulsively watchable ways."
212-239-6200, manhattantheatreclub.com
'IS THIS A ROOM' at the Vineyard Theater (closes on Nov. 24). Tina Satter's lauded play, based on a transcript of an F.B.I. interview with the whistle-blower Reality Winner, ends its interrogation. Ben Brantley praised the "almost forensic detail" of Emily Davis's central performance and the nerve-shredding over all. "Unlike more classic high-anxiety plays -- say, 'Oedipus Rex' or 'Macbeth' -- this production isn't about to offer you the cleansing release of catharsis," he wrote.
212-353-0303, vineyardtheatre.org
'THE MICHAELS' at the Public Theater (closes on Dec. 1). Richard Nelson's new play, the first of a planned cycle, clears its dinner table. A meal set in the home of a dying choreographer, this drama is even quieter than Nelson's other dramas set in Rhinebeck, N.Y., but Ben Brantley found it still as rich and "as hopeful as it is heartbreaking."

Texto completo: An investigation found that several sites owned by Ken LaCorte push inflammatory items -- stories, petitions and the occasional conspiracy theory -- to the public.
SAN FRANCISCO -- At first glance, the websites Conservative Edition News and Liberal Edition News have only one thing in common: Both have been carefully curated to inflame America's culture wars.
Conservative Edition News is a repository of stories guaranteed to infuriate the American right. Its recent headlines include "Austin sex-ed curriculum teaches kids how to obtain an abortion" and "HuffPost writer considers Christianity 'dangerous."'
On Liberal Edition News, readers are fed a steady diet of content guaranteed to drive liberal voters further left or to wring a visceral response from moderates. One recent story singled out an Italian youth soccer coach who called Greta Thunberg, the teenage climate activist, a "whore."
The sites are the work of Ken LaCorte, the former Fox News executive who was accused of killing a story about President Trump's affair with Stormy Daniels, the pornographic film actress, before the 2016 election.
Their content is written by a network of young Macedonians in Veles, a sleepy riverside town that was home to a collection of writers who churned out disinformation during the 2016 presidential election in the United States. Among Mr. LaCorte's network was one writer who helped peddle a conspiracy theory that Hillary Clinton had ties to a pedophile ring.
Until now, it was unclear who was behind the sites. But an investigation by The New York Times and researchers at Nisos, a security firm in Virginia, found that they are among several sites owned by Mr. LaCorte that push inflammatory items -- stories, petitions and the occasional conspiracy theory -- to the American public.
While big tech companies like Google and Twitter are trying to distance themselves from divisive politics by restricting or banning political ads, Mr. LaCorte's websites are a reminder that there is a cottage industry of small sites happy to stoke passions on both sides of the political aisle and cash in on that anger.
Conservative Edition News and Liberal Edition News forgo bylines. The only hint of their maker is in fine print at the bottom of each page: "By Bivona Digital Inc.," a corporation whose only known address is a drop box typically reserved for transient sailors off the San Francisco Bay in Sausalito, Calif.
Mr. LaCorte acknowledged in an interview this week that he operated the hyperpartisan sites with help from young Macedonians and American editors. He uses them, he said, to drive Facebook traffic to his flagship venture, LaCorte News, a "centrist-right" website that he brands as a "digital news start-up with the stated goal of restoring faith in the media."
"I wanted to try to find middle ground," Mr. LaCorte said. "Unfortunately, the things that work best right now are hyperactive politics. On one hand, that's at odds with what I want to do. But you can be more successful by playing the edgy clickbait game."
He added: "Where does that line turn from good business to 'Eh, that's sleazy'?"
Exploiting American cultural and political fissures to drive traffic to his websites has worked wonders. At last count, Mr. LaCorte had more than three million followers on the social network and 30 million unique visitors to his sites. Even he couldn't believe his success.
"One day I woke up and more than 1 percent of Americans were following my sites," he said.
Intentionally or not, the sites are mimicking Kremlin interference in 2016, when Russian operatives used fictitious personas to inflame American discord over Benghazi, border security, gun control and Black Lives Matter.
American officials have warned that Russia is laying groundwork for interference in 2020. In a rare joint statement this month, officials at the Department of Homeland Security, the F.B.I., the National Security Agency and other agencies warned that Russia, China, Iran and other nations would seek to interfere in the 2020 election through social media, disinformation and cyberattacks. The announcement was intended to assure Americans that the government was prepared.
What is less clear is how officials plan to address the growing and increasingly profitable marketplace for politically divisive content that is being operated by Americans. In this case, with help from Macedonia.
The spreading of politically divisive content or even blatant disinformation and conspiracy theories by Americans is protected free speech. Security experts said the adoption of Russian tactics by profit-motivated Americans had made it much harder to track disinformation.
"It's this blending we're most worried about," said Cindy Otis, Nisos' director of analysis and threat investigations. "It makes it much harder to determine motivation and even the actor."
She added, "This slow-and-steady mainstreaming of disinformation-like tactics is normalizing things we would otherwise identify as inauthentic behavior."
Mr. LaCorte had steered clear of promoting his role in the sites. His employees were careful to omit any mention of their involvement on their LinkedIn profiles. But The Times and Nisos traced their involvement through historical internet records, state business records, web server addresses, the WordPress publishing platform, and Facebook and Google Analytics accounts.
Mr. La Corte, an acolyte of Roger E. Ailes, the former Fox News chairman, served two decades at Fox before being pushed out in November 2016 as part of what he called a post-Ailes "corporate purge."
He soon began devising his own venture, LaCorte News, "center to right leaning, but nothing like the hard-core political sites you see around," he said in a Facebook post.
With a $ 1 million investment -- including $ 250,000 of his own money and more from friends and family -- he hired executives like John Moody, who left Fox after posting a racially inflammatory column, and brought on advisers, including Michael Oreskes, a former New York Times editor who was later ousted from an executive position at NPR amid sexual harassment allegations.
"Mr. LaCorte asked me for advice on launching a nonpartisan news site," Mr. Oreskes said. "I gave it, just as I would give advice on this important goal to anyone else who asked, including The New York Times."
Mr. Moody did not respond to requests for comment.
Almost immediately, Mr. LaCorte noted that there was little audience for his centrist news start-up on Facebook. "Facebook has created an onboarding system where I could not just go out and do standard news and have that be a successful strategy," he said.
He set up several Facebook pages on science, history and humor, anticipating that they would eventually direct traffic back to LaCorte News. The pages accumulated nearly 300,000 followers, but the traffic rarely crossed over from Facebook to Mr. LaCorte's websites.
In time, he reached a conclusion similar to one reached by the young Macedonians in 2016. They discovered they could make tenfold their country's average monthly salary using Google AdSense's pay-per-click ads next to inflammatory stories aimed at pro-Trump American audiences.
In the final weeks of the presidential campaign, Buzzfeed found more than 100 Macedonian pro-Trump websites that pumped out false and inflammatory stories.
Mr. LaCorte said he hadn't followed Macedonia's fake-news industry until early 2017, but came to admire its ads and traffic. He reached out to a 19-year-old Macedonian on Facebook and put a handful of his friends on monthly wages to do what he called "journalism lite" -- hot takes on sensationalist stories from The Daily Caller and other right-leaning sites.
Mr. LaCorte said his sites weren't making things up. "It's not like I went to Macedonians 'R' Us," he said. "Every story went through a U.S. editor. It's not like we were doing 'Hillary Clinton's Cronies Did This.' It was fair news. It was real."
Looking back, Mr. LaCorte said of the 15 stories that his various sites put out each day over the past two years, "I would only be embarrassed by four."
Facebook shut down Mr. LaCorte's pages and even employees' personal accounts last week after researchers at Nisos and The Times asked about his business. The move, which Mr. LaCorte denounced as conservative censorship, killed off roughly 90 percent of his income.
A Facebook spokeswoman said the action had nothing to do with content. After learning of the pages, she said, Facebook concluded that Mr. LaCorte had violated its terms of service by buying and exchanging so-called site privileges, and that accounts in his network had engaged with well-known Macedonian "troll farms."
While Mr. LaCorte waits to see if Facebook will turn the spigot back on, he is moving more content to YouTube and creating an anti-censorship Reddit-like "Free Speech Zone."
That content will also have Macedonian help. "I wish I could have an office full of locals," Mr. LaCorte said. "But there's no chance I could stay alive and pay Bay Area salaries as a start-up."
Recently, the Macedonian government began investing in media literacy, in an effort to extinguish its "fake news" reputation.
"I chuckled when I saw that," Ms. Otis said. "It hasn't gone away. What's happening is they're professionalizing into communication services that sound a lot more legitimate than teenagers just trying to make a buck. And now, Americans are hiring them."

Texto completo: Our guide to dance performances happening this weekend and in the week ahead.
BALLET HISPÁNICO at the Apollo Theater (Nov. 22-23, 8 p.m.). This popular company -- sharp in its steps, smooth in its attitude -- returns to the Apollo Theater for two performances that feature the premiere of "Tiburones" ("Sharks") from the choreographer Annabelle Lopez Ochoa, a frequent collaborator. The work critiques and attempts to correct the portrayal of Latino artists in the entertainment industry, while challenging gender roles as well. Also on the program: the return of "Nací," a 2009 dance by Andrea Miller that draws from the Sephardic Jewish culture of Spain, and "Con Brazos Abiertos," a 2017 piece by Michelle Manzanales that reconciles the two parts of her Mexican-American identity with a sense of humor and an eclectic soundtrack.

ALI CHAHROUR at the Fisher Center for the Performing Arts at Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y. (Nov. 22, 7:30 p.m.; Nov. 23, 3 p.m.; Nov. 24, 4 p.m.). As part of the Live Arts Bard biennial, Chahrour, a contemporary Lebanese choreographer who draws from the literary, cultural and religious traditions of the Arab world, presents his newly commissioned work, "Night." The dance aims to capture the age-old plight of lovers across time and place whose relationships violate social norms, and whose lust is replaced by longing after forced separation. Chahrour focuses on the physical consequences of that rupture, using violent convulsions to depict the breakdown of the body as it fights against cultural restrictions on love while yearning for reunion.

CUMPARSITA: THE TANGO at the Leon M. Goldstein Performing Arts Center at Kingsborough Community College (Nov. 23, 8 p.m.). In 1997, the revue "Forever Tango" opened on Broadway and became a surprise hit, returning a few times since, most recently in 2013. The creator of that show, Luis Bravo, has fashioned a new one from the same cloth: flashy costumes, smoldering stares, melodramatic intensity and an acrobatic version of the titular Argentine partnered dance, executed by several pairs of performers. "Forever Tango" was both embraced and dismissed as a spectacle (and applauded for its live music), and "Cumparsita" will likewise appeal to those with maximalist taste. The performance has sold out online; contact the box office regarding additional tickets that might become available.

MERCE CUNNINGHAM at the 92nd Street Y (Nov. 22, noon) and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum (Nov. 24-25, 7:30 p.m.). The celebration of the centennial of Cunningham's birth continues on Friday at the 92Y, where the former New York Times dance critic Alastair Macaulay, a Cunningham scholar and fan, and Patricia Lent, director of licensing for the Merce Cunningham Trust, will host a program that focuses on the 1989 work "August Pace," and includes performance excerpts and a discussion with a panel of Cunningham alumni. On Sunday and Monday at the Guggenheim, the former Cunningham dancer Dylan Crossman will present a program comprising Cunningham solos extracted from a spectacular showcase in April, as well as several duets that Crossman will dance with his fellow alum Jamie Scott. A discussion of Cunningham's legacy will follow.

NEW CHAMBER BALLET at New York City Center, Studio 5 (Nov. 22, 8 p.m.; Nov. 23, 7:30 p.m.). For 15 years now, the German-born choreographer Miro Magloire has quietly and consistently presented evenings of classical concert dance paired with live contemporary classical music. The intimacy and modesty of his usual performance space -- a studio rather than a theater -- paired with the easy grace of his dancers and his ear for interesting scores make for satisfying performances. To mark this anniversary, and the departure of two longtime dancers, Magloire introduces two new ballets -- a solo set to music by Schubert and an ensemble piece to Dvorak. They are accompanied by repertory works to John Cage, Wolfgang Rihm and Karlheinz Stockhausen.
212-581-1212, newchamberballet.com
NIA & NESS at JACK (Nov. 22-23, 7:30 p.m.). Nia Shand and Ness White met in 2013, became romantically involved and, a few years later, formed a company that pairs virtuosic poetry with articulate dance. In "Home," their second evening-length piece, which builds on a previous work, "Run," Nia & Ness offer a more detailed portrait of their lives as a black lesbian couple in New York City, using spoken text and dynamic movement to convey the violence and small daily affronts they have experienced. They also illustrate how the strength of their love has served as a kind of antidote to the sometimes hostile world that surrounds them.

Texto completo: NEW YORK - Oprah Winfrey's going on tour, and she's bringing a rock-star lineup with her, including former first lady Michelle Obama and Grammy- and Oscar-winner Lady Gaga.
Live Nation announced Wednesday that Winfrey's wellness arena tour with WW (Weight Watchers Reimagined) - dubbed "Oprah's 2020 Vision: Your Life in Focus" - will also include guest appearances from Jennifer Lopez, Dwayne Johnson, Amy Schumer, Tina Fey, Tracee Ellis Ross and Kate Hudson.
On the tour, Winfrey will hold one-on-one conversations with the superstars, first with Gaga on Jan. 4 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The nine-city tour will also visit St. Paul, Minnesota (Fey); Charlotte, North Carolina (Schumer); Atlanta (Johnson); Brooklyn, New York (Obama); Dallas (Ellis Ross); San Francisco (Hudson); and Los Angeles (Lopez). Winfrey will wrap the tour March 7 in Denver with BFF Gayle King.
In addition to the celebrity interviews, each full-day wellness event will include Winfrey discussing her own wellness journey; a dance exercise from choreographer Julianne Hough; talks from inspirational guest speakers; a pre-show dance party; a WW-customized box lunch; and interactive concourse activations.

Hunter to star in NBC comedy: Holly Hunter will star opposite Ted Danson in an upcoming NBC comedy set in the world of local politics. The network said Wednesday that Hunter will play a liberal Los Angeles city councilwoman in the series from writer-producers Tina Fey and Robert Carlock. An air date for the untitled series wasn't announced.
SuperM, BoA to perform at Global Goal Live: K-pop supergroup SuperM and singer BoA will perform at a Global Citizen event in Asia as part of a massive multi-continent concert next year. The advocacy organization says the performers will join the lineup of Global Goal Live: The Possible Dream in Seoul, South Korea, on Sept. 26. The 10-hour concert will span five locations.
"1619 Project" books: The New York Times' acclaimed "1619 Project" will be the basis for a series of books, for readers of all ages. Random House Group imprints have acquired rights to the books, the publisher announced Wednesday. The books will build upon the Times' magazine special issue from last summer that centered on the 400th anniversary of the first enslaved Africans to be brought to the U.S. and slavery's enduring legacy.

Texto completo: An upcoming exhibition at a Beijing arts center was canceled, the latest sign of how China's turn toward a more hard-nosed authoritarianism has crept into civil society.
BEIJING -- A prominent arts center in Beijing has canceled a Chinese-American artist's exhibition of works with strong social and historical themes, planned for December, after the local authorities declined to issue the necessary import permits. The cancellation comes amid a growing clampdown on civil society across the country and rising tensions between China and the United States.
China's censorship review process is notoriously opaque and there was no official reason given for withholding the permits. In a letter to lenders of the works announcing the cancellation, Philip Tinari, director of the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in Beijing, said that after months of back and forth with the local cultural authorities, the gallery was suddenly informed this month that the approvals would not be coming.
"Topics that were once relatively open for discussion are now increasingly scrutinized," Mr. Tinari wrote in the letter, which was seen by The New York Times. "An exhibition that might have been greenlighted a few years ago -- such as this one -- must now be canceled."
The show, featuring the artist Hung Liu, was scheduled to open on Dec. 6. Ms. Liu, who was born in the northeastern Chinese city of Changchun in 1948 and moved to the United States in 1984, is known for fusing her early artistic training in socialist realism with Western influences to create paintings based on historical photographs.
Her work can be overtly political, like a series of pencil sketches titled "Where Is Mao?" But the 30-plus paintings that had been proposed for the Beijing show focused more on questions of culture, gender, history and memory.
In an interview, Ms. Liu said that the local authorities had initially raised concerns about nine works, including a 1993 self-portrait based on a photograph of the artist as a young, rifle-toting woman at the end of the Cultural Revolution, the decade-long period of political tumult that rocked China under Mao Zedong, and a 1988 painting, "Abacus," or "Seven-Up Eight-Down" in Chinese -- a common phrase that is often used to describe the state of feeling agitated.
"Maybe they felt like it was a comment on the current state of China," said Ms. Liu, speaking by telephone from her home in Oakland, Calif.
Another work in question was a 2011 painting of 12 schoolgirls in uniforms wearing gas masks, which Ms. Liu said was originally based on a historical photograph of an air raid drill during World War II.
"The message is antiwar so I thought it was O.K., but when I talked with my Chinese artist friends about it, they just said one word: Hong Kong," Ms. Liu said.
In recent months, images of gas masks -- particularly as worn by students -- have become widely associated with the antigovernment protests that have convulsed Hong Kong since June and angered the authorities in Beijing, who see the demonstrations as a direct challenge to their rule in the semiautonomous territory.
Ms. Liu said that after the authorities voiced objections, she reluctantly agreed to withdraw the nine works in question from the show. What remained was still a "pretty strong show," she said, including a large-scale installation of 250,000 fortune cookies piled atop train tracks -- a reference to the nuggets of gold that lured a wave of Chinese immigrants to America in the 19th century, many of whom later went on to build the country's first Transcontinental Railroad.
The final show would also have included some of Ms. Liu's more recent works, based on the Depression-era photographs of Dorothea Lange as well as some works that had been exhibited in China before, like a painting of a Chinese mother and daughter pulling a barge upstream.
But in a sign of the fast-shrinking space for expression in China, the authorities decided in the end to effectively kill the show altogether by refusing to issue the approvals required to import the remaining works.
"I was so sad and disappointed," Ms. Liu said. "Of course my work has political dimensions, but my focus is really the human faces, the human struggle, the epic journey."
"I sincerely feel like all I'm doing is enshrining the anonymous working class who never had a voice," added Ms. Liu, who will be the subject of a retrospective at the National Portrait Gallery in Washington in 2021.
The show's cancellation, which was first reported by The Art Newspaper, is a setback for the UCCA, which is coming off the huge success of a major exhibition of works by Pablo Picasso and its recent announcement of plans to open an outpost in Shanghai.
It is also the latest indication of how China's turn toward a more hard-nosed authoritarianism under the leadership of Xi Jinping has crept into all corners of society. While censorship has been a source of frustration in China's cultural sectors for years, most knew generally where the so-called red lines were and how to avoid them.
But many now say the red line of censorship has been moving, a point that was illustrated most vividly over the summer when the opening of a big-budget Chinese patriotic movie -- of the sort typically beloved by the authorities -- was abruptly canceled.
Last year, several artworks that raised questions about the social and ethical implications of artificial intelligence and biotechnology were pulled at the last second from an exhibition on orders of the authorities in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong. More recently, the opening of the Pompidou Center in Shanghai was tainted by the revelation that the esteemed French cultural institution had agreed to censor several works in its inaugural show at the request of the authorities.
Ms. Liu, who was sent to do manual labor in the countryside for four years during the Cultural Revolution, said the cancellation of her show was a reminder not to take progress for granted.
"Chinese contemporary art over the past 25 years has reflected an opening up of speech in China, and a meaningful dialogue with the world," she said. "That openness is now beginning to feel like a dream."

Texto completo: The victim was a spectator at a Friday night playoff game in New Jersey.
PHILADELPHIA -- When the Philadelphia Eagles decided to host the remaining minutes of a New Jersey high school football game that was interrupted by gunfire last week, it was supposed to be a chance to write a new narrative: that violence would not win.
But the mood at Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia on Wednesday afternoon was not primarily one of triumph, as news spread that earlier that day a 10-year-old boy, Micah Tennant, one of three people injured in the shooting, had died.
"I was shocked," said Dashahn Draper, 16, a guard on the Camden High School team, who heard about the death in the locker room just before the game. "He was young. Football is supposed to bring people together. This shouldn't happen."
A few hundred people who attended Wednesday's game in the cavernous pro football stadium -- some friends, some family, a few school administrators -- held a moment of silence for Micah. For some attendees, that was the first time they had heard about Micah's death.
He was a spectator at the playoff game at Pleasantville High School on Friday. Camden High School was ahead, 6-0, when, just before 8:30 p.m., with 17 minutes remaining in the game, the shooting unfolded, sending spectators and players scrambling for safety.
Five people were initially charged in connection with the shooting. And on Wednesday, the Atlantic County prosecutor, Damon G. Tyner, said in a statement announcing Micah's death that one of the five men was now being charged with murder.
The man, Alvin Wyatt, was already facing two counts of attempted murder, unlawful possession of a weapon and possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose, according to the prosecutor's office.
Mr. Wyatt served more than two years in prison for unlawful weapons possession and was on parole after being released about a year ago.
Friday's shooting also injured a 27-year-old man, who police believe was the intended target, and a youth was grazed by a bullet, the authorities said. The sequence of events was captured on video by local news media covering the game.
In a statement on Wednesday, Mr. Tyner said: "On behalf of the Atlantic County Prosecutor's Office, we would like to express our sincere condolences to the Tennant family on the tragic passing of Micah. Words at this time seem so insufficient to portray the anger and outrage that our community feels regarding his loss."
Late Tuesday night, Micah's mother, Angela Tennant, posted on her Facebook profile thanking people for their support. "Everyday I talk in his ear and say Dew you're so loved and famous," she said in the post.
Some people at Lincoln Financial Field on Wednesday learned about Micah's death shortly before the game, which had many of the features of any regular high school football game, including a band and cheerleaders on the sidelines. The Pleasantville team learned about the death that morning, around 11 a.m., from its coach.
Some players had written Micah's name on their helmets and shirts.
Camden defeated Pleasantville in the game, 22-0, scoring 16 points during the 17 minutes played on Wednesday.
Hours before the game, Carson Wentz, the Eagles' starting quarterback, met with the high school players and praised the Eagles' decision to host the two high school teams. He said it was "really cool to see the organization step out and reach out to try to make a difference."
"You know," he said, "it's Friday night lights, it's something that kids just dream about playing in, and it's something I'll cherish for the rest of my life, is playing Friday night lights."
He added, "It might not undo what's happened, but just try and bring some joy and get all those families to keep moving forward."

Texto completo: The authorities are seeking more information about Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who worked with Rudy Giuliani in Ukraine and have been charged with campaign finance violations.
WASHINGTON -- Federal prosecutors in Manhattan issued subpoenas in recent weeks to several players in President Trump's fund-raising apparatus as part of an investigation into two associates of Rudolph W. Giuliani who have been charged with violating campaign finance laws, according to people familiar with the investigation.
The subpoenas went to a lobbying firm run by a top fund-raiser for Mr. Trump, Brian Ballard, and to two people who have helped raise money for America First Action, a super PAC created to support the president and allied candidates, the people said.
Mr. Ballard and the America First fund-raisers worked to varying extents with Mr. Giuliani's associates Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, American citizens who helped Mr. Giuliani wage a pressure campaign on Ukraine that is now at the center of the impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump.
The recent activity by prosecutors and F.B.I. agents shows that they have cast a wide net as they collect evidence about Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman, who were arrested last month. It also comes as the same prosecutors look into whether Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Trump's personal lawyer, violated a federal lobbying law in some of his dealings with Ukrainians.
Mr. Giuliani and one of his companies were mentioned by name in one of the subpoenas, which was issued to a businessman who was approached by Mr. Parnas seeking an investment.
He was trying to finance a portion of a $ 500,000 payment he had promised to Mr. Giuliani to consult for a company he helped found, Fraud Guarantee, according to a person familiar with the solicitation of the businessman. The businessman never provided the money.
There is no indication that those who have received subpoenas or agreed to provide documents or interviews are suspected of wrongdoing. Prosecutors and F.B.I. agents have been seeking to speak with witnesses about how Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman gained entree into elite Republican finance circles that brought them into direct contact with Mr. Trump.
Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman were charged with violations related to donations to various Republican politicians and groups, including a $ 325,000 contribution made to America First Action. They made the donation in the name of a company they had recently founded, Global Energy Producers.
America First Action has voluntarily turned over documents to prosecutors in Manhattan, according to people familiar with the investigation.
Prosecutors also arranged a voluntary interview in New York as soon as this week with Andrew Favorov, an executive with the Ukrainian state-owned gas company Naftogaz whom Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman tried to enlist in an effort to win business, potentially through Global Energy Producers.
Mr. Favorov has Russian and United States citizenship, and permanent resident status in Ukraine. His interview, which was first reported by The Associated Press, suggests that prosecutors' interest in Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman extends beyond their political donations, and into their business efforts.
The authorities arrested Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman on Oct. 9, sooner than previously planned, fearing they would leave the country without plans to return.
Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman, who have pleaded not guilty, played major roles in the effort by Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani to pressure the Ukrainian government to commit to investigations that could be politically helpful to Mr. Trump, which was first reported by The New York Times.
Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman helped connect Mr. Giuliani to Ukrainian prosecutors who claimed to have incriminating information about former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a leading contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. The prosecutor also claimed to have damaging information about Ukrainians who sought to undermine Mr. Trump in 2016 and about Marie L. Yovanovitch, the United States ambassador to Kyiv and a target of Mr. Trump and his allies.
Democrats contend that the efforts to force Ukraine to investigate those targets were an abuse of power. And witnesses in the impeachment hearings have suggested that Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman had financial motivations for pursuing the Ukrainian pressure campaign.
In addition to the investigation by federal prosecutors for possible violations of a lobbying law, Mr. Giuliani has been subpoenaed by the House's impeachment investigators. He has denied wrongdoing and said that he has no current business interests in Ukraine.
Mr. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor, has acknowledged accepting $ 500,000 for business and legal advice from Fraud Guarantee, and said that he represented Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman on a legal matter in Ukraine.
The investigation into Mr. Giuliani grew out of the investigation into Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman. The charges against Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman are narrowly focused, and mostly unrelated to the Ukrainian pressure campaign. Mr. Parnas has indicated a willingness to work with congressional impeachment investigators, but it is unclear whether he will testify.
Mr. Giuliani met Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman as they became involved in the Republican major-donor circuit, and the recent activity by prosecutors suggests that they are interested in learning more about how the men gained entree into that world.
Mr. Parnas also developed a relationship through Republican donor politics with Mr. Ballard, whose firm, Ballard Partners, paid Mr. Parnas at least $ 22,500 for referring business from the Turkish government.
The Turkish government agreed to pay Ballard Partners $ 1.5 million over a year in May 2017, and renewed its contract for $ 750,000 a year later, according to lobbying records.
William W. Taylor III, a lawyer for Ballard Partners, confirmed that the business referred by Mr. Parnas was with the Turkish government. Mr. Taylor said in a statement: "Ballard Partners is cooperating with a United States attorney's office for the Southern District of New York investigation. It has received a subpoena and is complying."
Kelly Sadler, a spokeswoman for America First Action, said in a statement that the group contacted the Southern District of New York last month "and offered to voluntarily cooperate."
"We have not been issued any subpoenas," she added. "America First Action strictly follows the law and, as this is an open matter, we have no further comment."
Joseph A. Bondy, a lawyer for Mr. Parnas, said he and his client were "pleased to know that the U.S. attorney's office in the Southern District of New York is continuing its investigation, and look forward to its witnesses providing complete and accurate information in response to their questions."
A spokesman for Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States attorney in Manhattan, declined to comment.

The Metropolitan Museum of Art, as one of the most important artistic institutions in North America, has long been looked to as a sort of control factor when spectators and commentators attempt to determine how entrenched, powerful museums tend to operate. In 2018, the museum hired Max Hollein, formerly the Director of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, to be the Met’s tenth director. This week, the Metropolitan Museum of Art announced that one of Hollein’s first hires as director is curator Dr. Denise Murrell, who will join the museum full-time in the newly-created position of associate curator for 19th and 20th century art.
In 2018, Murrell earned rave reviews with an exhibition that she curated during her time as a Ford Foundation Postdoctoral Research Scholar at Columbia University’s Wallach Art Gallery: “Posing Modernity: The Black Model From Manet and Matisse to Today.” With the exhibition, Murrell illustrated the centrality of the black figure to the development and evolution of modern art, focusing principally on Edouard Manet’s 1860’s portrayals of a model named Laure and branching outward to include an interdisciplinary analysis of other Impressionists, artists of the Harlem Renaissance, and more.

The exhibition also traveled to the Musee d’Orsay in Paris, helping to quash Murrell’s lingering fears that work concerning race wouldn’t find a broad audience. “We had record-setting audiences at Wallach,” she told Observer in an interview for this year’s Arts Power 50 list. “Many visitors said they were there for the first time. Visitors often said they made repeat visits, going back with friends and family. The audience was diverse.”
Now, with Dr. Murrell’s appointment at the Met, she is poised to inject further complexity into the way art is presented and displayed to audiences who are undeniably hungry for nuance. “Max and his team want to proactively move toward a more inclusive presentation of art history across all periods,” Murrell told the New York Times . “This is a moment of inflection at the Met—a reconsideration of the West that moves away from an exclusively European culture; a deeper presentation of artists of color and a greater breadth of images depicting people of color.”

Texto completo: If you want to understand why Sen. Elizabeth Warren has been trending in the polls in recent weeks, look no further than Wall Street.
The big money people who have been free to plunder the country's working class are all worked up about Warren's plans to hold them accountable and require them to pay a fair share of taxes like most other Americans.
"Our democracy has been hijacked by the rich and powerful," she often remarks on the primary campaign trail.
That's a message that has obviously energized a significant number of those paying attention to the Democratic primary campaign and, according to several news accounts, Wall Street financiers and wealthy individuals are in a panic.
The New York Times reported earlier in the month that big money is unleashing a barrage of public attacks, donating money to her Democratic rivals and scrambling to counter her blistering narrative about Wall Street.
They're predicting that if Warren were to win the presidency, our entire economic system would collapse. Billionaires like Leon Cooperman and even Bill Gates expressed alarm that Warren wants to add a surtax on those making more than $50 million a year. Chase Manhattan CEO Jamie Dimon complained that she's vilifying "successful people."
It's got some of us wondering if some of these honchos have lost their marbles.
Warren, of course, isn't the first candidate to make the concentration of wealth and economic inequality in America a campaign issue. Sen. Bernie Sanders has been assailing the dictatorship of wealth for years, but apparently the rich don't think he can get the Democratic nomination. They're not that sure about Warren.
Unlike Sanders, Warren calls herself a "capitalist," but she believes the current system that lavishes riches on CEOs and produces corporate billionaires while the working class languishes needs a house cleaning. And, of course, it certainly does.
There are millions of people out there whose memories are still fresh with what the Wall Street cabal did to them with its phony mortgage bundling, exotic financial instruments and, in several instances, outright fraud.
While millions lost their jobs, their homes and life savings in the Great Recession, most of those who caused the debacle paid no price. They weren't even embarrassed by the financial carnage they had caused. Worse, they fought every attempt at reform to keep it from happening again. Once a defender of corporate America, Warren grew increasingly alarmed by the concentration of power among the Wall Street elite. Greed knew no end. Regulators removed safeguards. The top 1% saw their taxes go down and their earnings rise. Working people were lucky to stay even.
There was a time when millionaires and billionaires did pay a fair share. Top income tax brackets were as high as 90%.
Even when John F. Kennedy became president in 1961, it was still at 70%.
Guess what the economy did just fine. The rich still got richer, but working people got raises, too. America's middle class was thriving.
Then, starting with Ronald Reagan in 1981, the government decided that we need something called "trickle-down" economics. Give the rich tax breaks and the people below will benefit, too.
This has been done three times in the years since, and the result? The top 1% now owns 40% of the nation's wealth more than all of the bottom 90% of Americans own.
Does Wall Street really have to wonder why Elizabeth Warren is doing well? CREDIT: By Dave Zweifel ; Dave Zweifel is editor emeritus of The Capital Times. dzweifel@madison. com, 608-252-6410 and on Twitter @DaveZweifel.

Texto completo: Former Bolivian President Evo Morales, who had done some good things for his country since becoming president in 2006, was forced from office following accusations of electoral improprieties. He went into exile and has since been granted asylum in Mexico.
The question of an ex-president, defeated or overthrown, not wanted by the successor government running around loose in his home country, potentially fueling an effort to regain power, is a recurring problem in international politics.
The ideal, from the point of view of peace and tranquility, is for the ousted leader to renounce politics altogether, stick to his pledge and concentrate on the happiness of his grandchildren forevermore, before being laid to rest in a quiet graveyard or a roaring crematorium.
This ideal, however, frequently does not mesh with the brash ambition that may have brought the deposed leader to power in the first place. Napoleon, returning from exile on Elba, is the classic example.
As an American diplomat serving in the U.S. Embassy in Zaire, I can remember being instructed to ask President Mobutu Sese Seko if Zaire would be willing to take in outgoing president of Haiti, Jean-Claude Duvalier, or "Baby Doc," whom the U.S. was looking to plant somewhere far from Haiti. Mobutu declined, gauging that he had enough problems at home without importing another. He later offered a home to the wife of the president of Rwanda after he was assassinated. She stayed in Zaire until Mobutu himself had to bail out.
All of this, and the current American political circus revolving around possible or impossible impeachment and the upcoming 2020 elections, inevitably raises the question of what would happen if President Donald J. Trump lost next November.
Let us recall, unhappily, that he has said that the only way he can lose a presidential election is through fraud. That is to say that he is going to resist leaving the White House, in the courts, in the streets or some other way. Never mind the Constitution. There is some thought that he has catered to the American military so that he can call on them if push comes to shove.
My own experience with the American military is that it would not intervene to save Mr. Trump or any other president in those circumstances. American military personnel are deeply devoted to their country and its Constitution. Nearly all of them believe they should stay out of partisan politics, the national equivalent of a nest of copperheads.
Thus, ousted from office through either impeachment or the loss of the 2020 election, Mr. Trump would need a home. Exile for him would be difficult. What country has he not offended, through tweets, betrayal or otherwise?
Kiev? Moscow? Even Ottawa or Mexico City? No. Perhaps his latest change of home state from New York to Florida, where he is a major property-owner, means he plans to urge its secession to serve as a place of comfortable exile for him - golf, beaches, bikinied maidens and so forth.
But all of these scenarios likely are pipe dreams. The Republican-controlled Senate is not going to vote to impeach the president. Meanwhile, the Democrats are still floundering to come up with a viable candidate to face him in 2020. Joe Biden's paint has been badly scratched by the Ukraine affair. Why didn't he just tell his son not to involve himself and his family in Soprano-like Ukraine? Bad judgment.
I am not prone to saying with passivity that we are going to be stuck with the lying, crooked, unpatriotic Mr. Trump for four more years, but I am saying that I don't like the drift of this, nationally or internationally.

Texto completo: More than two years after a gunman opened fire at a country music festival on the Las Vegas Strip, a Mira Loma woman who was paralyzed in the attack has died, authorities said, raising the death toll of the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history to 59.
Kimberly Gervais, 57, died Friday evening at Redlands Community Hospital, according to San Bernardino County coroner's officials.
An autopsy is pending. Gervais had suffered spinal injuries and was living in a nursing facility before being taken to the hospital Friday, authorities said.

On Oct. 1, 2017, 64-year-old Stephen Paddock carried out a meticulously planned attack from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel across the street from the Route 91 Harvest country music festival. He used a modified semiautomatic gun to target the crowd, firing so rapidly that authorities initially thought he was armed with a fully automatic rifle.
The initial death toll was 20, but that number soon climbed.
In a Facebook group dedicated to survivors and victims of the shooting, Gervais' death was mourned.
"Our hearts are extremely heavy tonight with this incredibly sad tragic news," a post from Sunday read. "Our hearts, thoughts and prayers are with the family of Kim Gervais who became the 59th fatality of the Las Vegas mass shooting when her heart gave out over the weekend after bravely struggling from her injuries which had left her a paraplegic."
Las Vegas officials are considering adding another tree to the Las Vegas Community Healing Garden memorializing the victims, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal.
Gervais' sister, Dena Sarvela, told KPTV that the quadriplegic woman suffered immensely in the last two years.
"She hurt. Even though she was paralyzed from the neck [down], she could feel all the pain," Sarvela told the Oregon news outlet. "There was scrap metal still in her because he used exploding bullets."
According to a New York Times article, Gervais broke down in tears when she learned she was left without the use of her limbs.
She had attended country music concerts for years and had looked forward to the Route 91 festival.
Weeks later, she found herself in a hospital room.
"I'm disgusted," she told the New York Times of the gunman. "I'm angered. I have all kinds of emotions toward him. Because he took a part of me that I can't get back."

Main Street: The Attack on Asian-Americans

Texto completo: Asian-Americans have finally made it in America. How do we know? Not from their wealth or educational achievements, but from the way progressives now target those in the community who believe people shouldn't be judged by skin color. For in so doing, these Asian-Americans have exposed a growing fault line in affirmative-action orthodoxy.
The most recent occasion for progressive grievance comes courtesy of the state of Washington. There, Asian-Americans proved instrumental in killing a law that would have overturned a two-decade-old ban on racial preferences in public education, employment and contracting. To do this, Asian-Americans successfully rallied to force the law onto the ballot -- and then defeated it. It's a staggering achievement in a state that ranks among America's bluest, and in a contest where the pro-affirmative-action side enjoyed more resources plus the support of the political establishment, including an Asian-American former governor.
The ballot referendum in Washington isn't the first time Asian-Americans have rebelled against an attempt to sneak racial discrimination back into the law. Five years ago, when California considered a law that would have reversed its own ban on racial preferences, a backlash by the Asian-American community forced three Asian-American Democrats who had voted yes in the state Senate to switch sides -- dooming the measure. In New York, Asian-Americans are now battling Mayor Bill de Blasio's bid to increase the number of African-American and Latino kids at the city's specialized high schools -- at the expense of Asian-American children. Meanwhile, a high-profile lawsuit brought against Harvard for its race-based admissions preferences is likely to end up before the Supreme Court.
The Asian-American role in these campaigns is not going over well in some parts of the community. Comedian Hasan Minhaj closed out his 2018 Netflix special by calling the Asian-Americans suing Harvard "the worst kind" of Americans. Playwright Young Jean Lee wrote an op-ed in the New York Times calling the Harvard lawsuit "a cynical manipulation that urges Asian-Americans to sell out other people of color." In the Nation, Claire Jean Kim says that what we are seeing is "nascent, conservative Chinese immigrant nationalism" combining with "an older, conservative white nationalism" to inflame anti-affirmative-action politics.
That's one way of looking at it. Another is that increasing numbers of Asian-Americans, rather than unthinkingly embracing identity-politics dogma, have come to recognize that using race discrimination to promote diversity, especially in education, is excluding their children from opportunities they have earned. Some are also struck by a progressive narrative that encourages the celebration of diversity -- the Asian-American community itself spans dozens of nations, ethnicities, religions and languages -- even while insisting all are required to think alike.
One man whose name comes up often in these complaints is Edward Blum. A visiting fellow at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, Mr. Blum is also president of Students for Fair Admissions, which is leading the lawsuit against Harvard. In an earlier day Mr. Blum might have been hailed for reaching out across racial lines to work for a colorblind America. Alas, the demonology of the day holds that Mr. Blum is working cynically, as the American Civil Liberties Union puts it, to "pit people of color against one another." Never mind that Mr. Blum makes an unlikely avatar for white privilege.
"I grew up in a Yiddish-speaking household where we children were taught that racial and religious discrimination were malicious," he says. "My efforts to help end the discrimination that Asian-Americans suffer when applying to elite colleges is part of a long tradition of civil rights advocates."
The champions of affirmative action point out that when Washington's ban originally passed in November 1998, it did so with a robust 58% of the vote. This time, it was sustained very narrowly (50.4% to 49.6%), suggesting public opposition to affirmative action is thinning. But Mr. Blum suggests that the vague wording of the referendum -- which included language guaranteeing opportunity and prohibiting quotas -- may have more to do with the narrow margin.
Compare the wording of Washington ballot measure, he says, with that of a Pew Research Center survey from earlier this year. When asked directly whether "race or ethnicity" should be a "major factor," a "minor factor" or "not a factor" in college admissions, 73% of Americans chose "not a factor." Not only did 78% of whites agree but so did 65% of Hispanics, 62% of blacks, 58% of Asian-Americans -- and 63% of Democrats.
Meanwhile Asian-American leaders who contend that affirmative action is doing their community no favors find themselves denounced as sellouts. Wai Wah Chin, president of the Chinese American Citizens Alliance of Greater New York, says this is no different from how blacks and Latinos who also dissent from the progressive party line on race have been treated.
"For many Asian-Americans who mobilized against the Washington ballot initiative," she says, "it was their first participation in American politics. In the 19th century we had the Chinese Exclusion Acts. In the 21st, we are fighting a modern Asian Exclusion Act."

Texto completo: If you are going to end another life, at least end it mercifully.
NASHVILLE -- Last week, Walden's Puddle, a nonprofit wildlife rescue organization in a rural area of Nashville, posted a set of photos of a barred owl caught in the jaws of a leg-hold trap. The first photo, which featured the owl on the ground, its wings spread wide and its eyes cast down, was emblazoned with the words "Graphic images ahead." I didn't click through to see the rest of the pictures. The sight of that magnificent creature of the air tethered to the ground was graphic enough to break my heart. I didn't need to see what the rest of the images would inevitably reveal: sinews torn, bones splintered, flesh bloody and swollen, great yellow claws mangled beyond repair.
Walden's Puddle rehabilitates and releases orphaned and injured animals, and its Instagram account is normally a feel-good feed of squirrels, songbirds, turtles, deer, raccoons, opossums, snakes, rabbits, foxes, skunks, groundhogs, bobcats -- pretty much everything that flies or crawls or walks or swims -- and all of them on the mend. The caption to the post about the barred owl, which had to be euthanized, was uncharacteristically fierce:
These traps are cruel, evil, disgusting and should be illegal, causing unimaginable suffering to any creature who gets caught in its unforgiving jaws. While it is illegal to harm protected bird species such as this one (though these situations rarely result in criminal charges), these types of traps are sadly still legal to use in the state of Tennessee and in many other places, though they've been outlawed for many years in other parts of the world. Because the law requires they only be checked every 36 hours, any animal stuck in its grip will experience unimaginable pain and fear, possibly for hours or days.
Although their use has been banned or severely curtailed in more than 120 countries, leg-hold traps are indeed legal in Tennessee and in most other states in this country. Traps are sometimes used by farmers and ranchers to catch livestock predators, but the primary use for leg-hold traps is to catch an animal in a way that preserves the value of its pelt. Fur-edged down parkas, a fashion trend kick-started by a 2013 Sports Illustrated cover featuring the model Kate Upton wearing a bikini and a fur-trimmed Canada Goose parka, are now so prevalent among the affluent that they have caused a boom in backwoods trapping.
Trappers still use leg-hold traps illegally in states where they have been banned, but the problem isn't generally a matter of legality. The problem is that these traps, and every other kind of trap on the market, are indiscriminate. They mangle pets and people. They mutilate "trash animals" whose pelts are worth nothing to the fur industry. They destroy songbirds and raptors, all of whom are federally protected. And in every one of those creatures, they cause unimaginable suffering.
There are many contentious issues here, but let's leave aside for now the question of how on God's green earth a wild animal's life could possibly be worth less than a fashion statement. Let's leave aside the question of whether there are better ways for farmers and ranchers to share their ecosystem with the animals who were there first, and better ways for trappers to make a living. Let's leave aside all fundamental questions of whether human beings have the right to take another animal's life, and if so for what reasons. These are good questions, and other writers have addressed the issues at length, and from all sides of the argument.
The question I want to ask is simpler than that. I want to know why it is still legal to kill animals in ways that cause inexpressible pain and fear and destruction, to both the targeted animals and an immense range of others. Why, when there are humane ways to end an animal's life, is it still legal to end an animal's life in any other way? Even people who have no moral qualms about killing animals, at least in some contexts, would surely draw the line at lethal methods that cause another creature to suffer terribly, and for no reasonable purpose.
Hunters, for example, are just beginning to recognize the collateral damage that lead ammunition does to scavenger animals -- who are poisoned by eating lead-tainted meat left in the field -- and opting to hunt with copper bullets instead. The stakes are high and growing. Many species are already struggling because of habitat loss and climate change. We can't afford to keep losing upward of 20 million bears, coyotes, raptors and carrion eaters like vultures and ravens for no reason but longstanding habit among hunters.
Too many people aren't aware that wild animals so often suffer horrific deaths, even closer to home. We prefer not to get blood on our hands, so we choose to kill them in ways that keep their deaths out of sight. A mousetrap is designed to kill instantly, but we don't want to look at the little broken-necked mouse, so we set out poison. We don't see the mouse staggering outside to die slowly. We never think of the hawk or the fox that will eat the poisoned mouse, and so we don't think of its terrible, stumbling death either. Or we set out little cardboard boxes lined with glue, never imagining the skin-peeling horror that happens when an animal stuck in a glue trap struggles to break free.
And people who wear parkas trimmed in fur don't think about the barred owl whose feet were destroyed by a leg-hold trap meant for a coyote. They probably don't even think about the coyote, struggling for days in the snow with a mutilated leg -- bleeding, torn, bone-splintered -- only to die of suffocation or blunt-force trauma when the trapper arrives to claim his pelt.
The word "humane" refers to qualities we believe are part of human nature: tenderness, compassion, mercy. We rarely live up to our own etymology, but in this matter it poses no great trouble for us to do so. We don't need to agree on whether it's morally permissible to kill animals to agree that this is not the way to do it. It's time to ban glue strips. It's time to ban rat poison. It's time to ban lead ammunition. It's time to ban traps that injure but do not kill. There is no good reason not to.

Texto completo: Readers say his regret is welcome but too little too late.
To the Editor:
Re "Bloomberg Says He Now Regrets 'Stop and Frisk"' (front page, Nov. 18):
Understandable as a political strategy, but not credible as a heartfelt apology.
It's too late and too facile, especially coming at a time when it serves Michael R. Bloomberg's electoral interests. Especially when he defended the tactic for years in the face of undeniable evidence that it was racist and illegal. He even said, "I think we disproportionately stop whites too much and minorities too little."
As other New York City mayors have done, Mr. Bloomberg is paying the price for not restraining the Police Department's worst practices.

To the Editor:
Even if Michael R. Bloomberg's apology is genuine and most sincere, it would have been much more credible if he had offered it to a carefully selected group of black and Latino victims of his stop-and-frisk policy instead of to a gathering at the Christian Cultural Center, a black megachurch, in Brooklyn.
His response is difficult to accept, even for African-Americans like me who would like to believe him. It suggests an apparent insensitivity to how stop-and-frisk was reminiscent of the South African passbook laws during apartheid. Under those laws, it was compulsory for all black people over 16 to carry a passbook when in a white neighborhood.
Let's hope that Mr. Bloomberg recognizes that his apology is only a first baby step in accounting for his stop-and-frisk policy.

Trump Can Temporarily Withhold Tax Records

Texto completo: John Roberts blocked an appeals court ruling requiring disclosure of the records while the Supreme Court considers how to proceed.
WASHINGTON -- Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. on Monday temporarily blocked an appeals court ruling that required President Trump to turn over financial records to a House committee. The brief order gave no reasons and served to maintain the status quo while the justices decided how to proceed.
In a letter to the court earlier on Monday, lawyers for the committee said they did not oppose a brief interim stay. In entering one, the chief justice ordered the committee's lawyers to file papers on whether to grant a longer stay by Thursday. If the justices grant a longer stay, they will next consider whether to hear Mr. Trump's appeal.
The case, concerning a subpoena from the House Oversight and Reform Committee, is one of two cases before the Supreme Court in which Mr. Trump is seeking to halt disclosures of his financial records by his accounting firm, Mazars USA. The other case concerns a subpoena from Manhattan prosecutors to the firm seeking eight years of his personal and business tax returns.
The Supreme Court is expected to announce whether it will hear the appeals in the coming weeks. If it declines to step in, appeals court rulings requiring disclosure will stand, and Mazars has indicated that it will supply the requested records. If the Supreme Court agrees to hear the cases, it will probably hear arguments early next year and issue decisions by June.
No stay from the Supreme Court was needed in the Manhattan case because prosecutors there had agreed not to seek immediate release of the records in exchange for a prompt request for Supreme Court review. There was no such agreement in the House case.
"It has now been seven months since the Oversight Committee asked for these records," Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, a New York Democrat and the committee's acting chairwoman, said in a statement last week. "It is time for the president to let us do our job and stop blocking Mazars from complying with the committee's lawful subpoena."
Both subpoenas sought information concerning hush-money payments made in the run-up to the 2016 election. Mr. Trump and his company reimbursed the president's former lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, for payments to the pornographic film actress Stormy Daniels, who said she had an affair with Mr. Trump. The president has denied the relationship.
The House subpoena also sought records prompted by Mr. Cohen's testimony that Mr. Trump had inflated and deflated descriptions of his assets on financial statements to obtain loans and reduce his taxes.
Mr. Trump's lawyers argued that the House committee was powerless to obtain his records because it had no legislative need for them. They said the panel was engaged in an improper criminal inquiry and was not seeking information to help it enact legislation.
Lawyers for the committee responded that the records were needed for multiple, proper reasons; that courts should not second-guess congressional decision-making; and that the committee had the authority to issue subpoenas without separate authorization by the full House.
In October, a divided three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit refused to block the subpoena.
"Having considered the weighty interests at stake in this case, we conclude that the subpoena issued by the committee to Mazars is valid and enforceable," Judge David S. Tatel, who was appointed by President Bill Clinton, wrote for the majority. Judge Patricia A. Millett, appointed by President Barack Obama, joined the majority opinion.
In dissent, Judge Neomi J. Rao, appointed by Mr. Trump, wrote that "allegations of illegal conduct against the president cannot be investigated by Congress except through impeachment."
In the case concerning the grand jury subpoena in New York, Mr. Trump's lawyers made a different argument, saying that he was immune from all criminal proceedings and investigations so long as he remained in office. But even if some federal investigations may be proper, they said, the Supreme Court should rule that state and local prosecutors may not seek information about a sitting president's conduct.
"That the Constitution would empower thousands of state and local prosecutors to embroil the president in criminal proceedings is unimaginable," Mr. Trump's lawyers wrote.
Mr. Trump's lawyers noted that the Supreme Court heard cases concerning claims of immunity from Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Clinton.
"The court should do the same here," the petition said. "Whether the Constitution permits an assertion of this kind of authority over the chief executive raises a momentous question of first impression about the scope of presidential immunity."
In the two earlier cases, United States v. Nixon in 1974 and Clinton v. Jones in 1997, both presidents suffered unanimous losses.
On Nov. 4, a unanimous three-judge panel of a federal appeals court in Manhattan ruled against Mr. Trump. The court, in a focused ruling, said state prosecutors may require third parties to turn over a sitting president's financial records for use in a grand jury investigation.

Texto completo: Two prison workers who were guarding Jeffrey Epstein when he hanged himself could be charged as early as this week with falsifying records.
Two federal prison workers on duty the night Jeffrey Epstein killed himself in a Manhattan jail could be charged as early as this week with falsifying records to hide their failure to check on him as was required, according to a person briefed on the case.
The workers, who have not been publicly identified, came under scrutiny soon after Mr. Epstein's death because they were responsible for monitoring the high-security unit where Mr. Epstein, the disgraced financier who had previously been convicted of sex crimes, was being held.
Rather than checking on Mr. Epstein every half-hour as they were supposed to, the workers fell asleep for several hours and doctored corrections records to cover up what they had done, according to several law enforcement and prison officials with knowledge of the matter.
The charges against the workers would be the first to arise from a criminal inquiry into the death of Mr. Epstein, who hanged himself at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan while awaiting trial on new sex-trafficking charges.
Mr. Epstein, 66, had been held at the jail for more than a month when he was found early on Aug. 10. He had pleaded not guilty and was set to go on trial next year. If convicted, he faced up to 45 years in prison.
New York City's chief medical examiner ruled the death a suicide. Despite having only recently been removed from a suicide watch, Mr. Epstein was left unchecked for hours before tying a bedsheet to his bunk and hanging himself.
Lawyers for Mr. Epstein challenged the medical examiner's finding, and a pathologist hired by his family said that "evidence points to homicide."
That Mr. Epstein was able to kill himself while in federal custody was an embarrassment for the Justice Department and the Bureau of Prisons.
Attorney General William P. Barr said at the time of Mr. Epstein's death that a preliminary investigation had turned up "serious irregularities" at the Manhattan jail, whose warden was reassigned.
"We will get to the bottom of what happened," he added. "There will be accountability."
The two corrections workers who are expected to face charges were placed on leave in the days after Mr. Epstein's death. In recent weeks, federal prosecutors in Manhattan have offered them plea deals, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.
The United States attorney's office in Manhattan declined to comment.
Falsifying government records is a felony, but it is typically punished with suspension by the Bureau of Prisons, one prison official said.
That could be changing. Kathleen Hawk Sawyer, who previously led the bureau and was handed the reins again by Mr. Barr after Mr. Epstein's death, warned staff members in a memo this month that falsifying logs could result in criminal investigation.
"Recent reviews of institution operations have resulted in findings that some staff members have failed to perform rounds and complete counts on housing units while documenting that they have," said the memo, which was obtained by The New York Times.
"Failure to conduct rounds, complete counts, and providing inaccurate information in government systems and documents are considered very serious allegations of misconduct by the agency, and will be responded to appropriately," Ms. Sawyer said.
The investigation being led by federal prosecutors is one of three inquiries into the circumstances surrounding the death of Mr. Epstein, who was accused of running a sex-trafficking scheme that exploited dozens of underage girls in New York, Florida and the United States Virgin Islands.
The Bureau of Prisons is conducting an internal inquiry focused on its personnel and procedures. The findings of that investigation are expected to be released soon.
Michael E. Horowitz, the Justice Department's inspector general, is investigating the possibility of systemic failures at the Manhattan jail and the Bureaus of Prisons more broadly. The results of that inquiry are not expected for some time.
Benjamin Weiser contributed reporting.

Texto completo: Health care for all
Editor: I was moved by the Oct. 20 Sunday Times health and science page article: “To protect against skin cancer, the key is vigilance,” by New York Times writer Jane E. Brody.
As someone helping to care for an elderly parent, I have seen the benefits of regular health checkups and screenings. I know of times when I, others in my family and close friends have postponed screenings, treatments and medications due, in large part, to the prohibitive costs associated with health care - even while insured.
We know early screenings save lives. Officials at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, for example, report that tens of thousands of lives are saved each year through routine cardiovascular exams alone. What’s more, screenings save money. The surgeon general’s office estimates that the nation could save $3.5 billion each year if screenings were greatly increased, shifting the costs from treating disease to preventive care. Yet many Americans delay coverage due to costs.
Many studies, such as one at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, indicate that government-funded health care is not only economically viable but would cost less. This is one of the reasons why I support Bernie Sanders for president. In addition to “Medicare for All,” we need the structural changes he will work to accomplish for our financial, mental and physical well-being.
JOHN SAKSON
JESSUP
President Ruiz
Editor: Some people might remember Rosie Ruiz.
She was the apparent winner, in record time, of the women’s division of the 1980 Boston Marathon. But in a post-race interview, she showed that she knew nothing about race preparation or the most significant landmarks on the course. Suspicious officials subsequently discovered that she had jumped into the race about a half-mile from the finish. They also found that six months previously, she had used a similar ploy to record a sub-three hour time in the New York City Marathon, a time that qualified her for the Boston Marathon.
She retroactively was disqualified from both events. In other words, not only was she unqualified, but she had also lied and cheated to win.
You see where this is going.
Ruiz’s marathon strategy sounds more than a little like Donald Trump’s presidential campaign strategy, as revealed in special counsel Robert Mueller’s report and the current impeachment proceedings. Sadly, I don’t think that President Trump will be removed from office and I do think he will be re-elected in 2020.
But I also think that Trump is the Rosy Ruiz of U.S. presidents.

Honor educators
Editor: This week, we celebrate American Education Week, a great opportunity to appreciate the amazing public school educators and support professionals who work hard every day to prepare our students for future success.
Our educators introduce students to the wonders of reading. They teach them to reason with numbers and explore the mysteries of science. They give up lunch breaks and stay after school to give students the extra help they need.
During American Education Week, we also honor the many other people who help make our public schools great. From parents and grandparents to community leaders and entrepreneurs, all play a critical role in building great public schools for our students. The classroom is where students learn to think, solve problems and cooperate with each other.
These skills are critical in shaping the future of America. Thank you for being a part of it. Your support makes all the difference.

Triumphs overlooked
Editor: I take great umbrage with the hint that Lackawanna County’s ship is off course and we are “acrimonious, fragmented and ineffective” (“Put County on better course,” Oct. 31).
There were no tax increases over these four years and we consolidated county government in one central location, which resulted in saving $1.5 million on leases. There was no property reassessment to create additional tax burdens and we gave voters the opportunity to make the decision and did not force it on them. We increased benefits for veterans, community reinvestment funding, instituted upgrades to our 911 radio signals and land bank, putting 119 properties back on the tax rolls and adding five municipalities to the organization with, hopefully, more to follow. Our administration refinanced a bond series, saving the taxpayers more than $30 million over the life of the debt.
Our administration was responsive and performed its duties with diligence and took on all issues in a professional manner. We did not shirk our responsibilities, unlike The Times-Tribune, when it moved its printing plant from Scranton to Waverly, reducing our tax base.
Our administration worked feverishly in investing in our future. Our top priority was always our 214,000 constituents and their futures.
It’s my hope that the newspaper was as effective and invested here instead of criticizing the county’s positive accomplishments.
PATRICK M. O’MALLEY
LACKAWANNA COUNTY COMMISSIONER
Editor’s Note: The Times-Tribune did not suggest in the editorial that Lackawanna County had raised taxes.
The newspaper’s printing plant, in Scott Twp. near the Waverly exit of Interstate 81, expanded, rather than reduced, the county tax base. Taxes on The Times-Tribune’s downtown headquarters did not decline when the company moved print production to Scott Twp. in 1988, and the production plant is a major structure on what had been empty land.

Texto completo: In May 2017, elite marathon runner Shalane Flanagan tweeted a very personal piece of information. In all her years of training and competing against the best in the world, she wrote, she had never missed a menstrual cycle.
Five months later, she won the New York City Marathon.
Flanagan's tweet was startling because many athletes don't even talk to their coaches about their periods—much less the world. It was also surprising because of the long-held perception that it's normal, even preferable, for women in distance sports to be so lean that they no longer menstruate.
"I just wanted to reinforce to endurance athletes that, 'Yes, here I am. I run 120, 130 miles a week. I don't miss (my period). So it's not normal,'" Flanagan said in a recent interview. "That doesn't mean I'm not trying or training hard enough."
Flanagan recently retired from competitive running and is transitioning to coaching in the elite Nike-sponsored Bowerman Track Club. She'll be one of the few high-level female coaches in the world, and said she plans to talk to athletes about their cycles.
A combination of mostly-male coaching ranks, a lack of sports-science research on women and public silence about the topic have combined to keep athlete menstruation in the background. But those dynamics are changing. Female athletes are speaking about the importance of getting a period and embracing emerging research about how hormonal fluctuations can affect training and performance.
Running prodigy Mary Cain told the New York Times recently that during her time with the now-defunct elite training group the Nike Oregon Project, she stopped getting her period for three years after coaches pressured her to lose weight. Nike has said it will investigate Cain's allegations.
Cain told her story in the wake of the four-year ban for doping conduct of her coach, Alberto Salazar. Salazar said he was sorry his frank discussions with athletes about the impact of weight on performance caused hurt feelings but disputed that he encouraged female athletes to maintain an unhealthy weight.
Dawn Scott, high-performance coach of the U.S. women's soccer team, talked after the team's World Cup victory about using the period-tracking app FitrWoman to help mitigate hormone-related performance shifts among players through nutrition and sleep.
Flanagan co-wrote the cookbook "Run Fast. Eat Slow," focusing on nourishing recipes for athletes, with Elyse Kopecky, who said she got an irregular period for years while a competitive runner in high school and at North Carolina.
Many female endurance athletes struggle with menstrual dysfunction at some point, often because they're not eating enough, said Kathryn Ackerman, medical director of the Female Athlete Program at Boston Children's Hospital.
"There's certainly a lot of resistance to gaining weight because there's no question that being light is an advantage in running," Dr. Ackerman said. "But when they start to get injured, they start to see that there's a delicate balance between getting normal function and being thin enough to feel like they are racing well."
The International Olympic Committee in recent years published consensus statements on a syndrome called Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport, or RED-S, from which men also can suffer. The syndrome is fueled by an athlete taking in less food than needed for her level of exercise, which results in inadequate energy to support healthy bodily functions—including a menstrual cycle.
Most girls begin menstruating between ages 11 and 14, and can lose their periods if their weight or body fat are too low.
A common remedy for athletes who lose their periods has been to put them on hormonal birth control. But that approach masks the problem of underfueling, does not correct the multiple hormonal disruptions that can affect health and sports performance, and does not improve bone density, Dr. Ackerman said.
"The best solution is to get their own cycles," she said.
Menstrual cycles make women more complicated research subjects and historically discouraged medical studies on them, particularly in the area of sports science, said Georgie Bruinvels. She's lead scientist in the FitrWoman program, produced by the Ireland-based sports-science and data analytics company Orreco.
Hormone levels rise and fall during a woman's roughly 28-day menstrual cycle, and researchers only in recent years are figuring out exactly how those changes affect female athlete performance.
In the lead-up to last summer's World Cup, Dr. Bruinvels tracked U.S. women's soccer players' cycles. She made sure they consumed anti-inflammatory foods such as berries before their periods, took in enough iron during their periods and maintained healthy habits throughout the month.
"We know that eating a diet that is high in saturated fat, not eating enough anti-inflammatory and antioxidant-rich foods, not sleeping well, consuming too much alcohol, smoking and being psychologically stressed can all exacerbate symptoms," Dr. Bruinvels said. "So getting all of those in check is a really powerful way to help you manage symptoms."
Many athletes have flocked to the 2016 book "Roar," about how to match food and fitness to women's physiology. It was co-written by author and athlete Selene Yeager and Stacy Sims, senior research scientist with the Sports Performance Research Institute New Zealand at Auckland University of Technology. At a recent TEDx talk , Dr. Sims said silence about periods is among the reasons girls drop out of sports.
In September, U.S. Olympic triathlete Sarah True asked her more than 20,000 Twitter followers: "Random question for female athletes & coaches of female athletes: Do you track menstrual cycles and the effects on performance? Not just menses," she wrote, using a medical word for period. Just over half of respondents said they did.
True said that only in the past year has she started tracking her cycle closely enough to see a pattern.
"My worst training days normally coincide with ovulation," she said. That means feeling sluggish, getting more headaches, having a lower tolerance for heat and performing worse at the highest-intensity exercises.
True said she was relieved to discover that the dip in performance had an explanation. She is 37 years old, and nearly all the coaches in her career have been men. Only with a few of them did she broach the topic of menstruation, she said.
"We've already accepted that high performance, a lot of it is about data," she said. "A potential breakthrough for women's sports is having a highly individualized training program that reflects hormonal fluctuation based on menstrual cycle."

Texto completo: Many Gen Z-ers are aware of privacy concerns on the Chinese-owned app TikTok. But they are in too deep to opt out.
The media executive had a dire message for Kayla Curry and her classmates: If you have TikTok on your phone, delete it.
The executive, who had come to talk to the journalism students at Missouri State University, was concerned about the app's Chinese owners and the potential that TikTok could be used to spread disinformation, according to Curry. Soon after that, the 19-year-old sophomore got a news alert from the New York Times reporting that TikTok was the subject of a national security investigation by the U.S. government.
Curry joined TikTok in September. She's a pretty typical user of the short video app: scrolling, sometimes for hours, watching an endless stream of videos that TikTok's mysterious algorithms guessed she would love. But as she read about the off-screen dimensions of the app, about who decides which videos get seen and which don't, she started to worry. And she processed that worry by making a TikTok video joking about it.
'Apparently TikTok is owned by a Chinese company that data-mines user information and sells it to the Chinese government,' Curry said, directly addressing the camera. 'Yikes.
'But honestly it's a small price to pay,' she continued, 'because this app is free and therapy is not.' Her video has more than 370,000 views.
TikTok referred The Washington Post's request for comment to an October statement on the company blog, which said that TikTok's data for U.S. users is stored in the United States, and that TikTok is 'not influenced by any foreign government, including the Chinese government.' Earlier this month, The Post reported that ByteDance, TikTok's Chinese parent company, subjected moderators to oversight and strict content rules as recently as last spring, according to multiple former employees. TikTok has said it has since changed the moderation process for U.S. content and is working on making the app more responsive to the expectations of American users.
TikTok's core audience is Gen Z, a generation that simultaneously balances a deep understanding of how the Internet has eroded privacy with the reality that living online is basically a requirement for young people who don't want to be hermits. Members of that generation are accustomed to the tension of projecting their lives to the world while coming to grips with the scrutiny and surveillance that follow.
Gen Z, after all, was responsible for the 'FBI Man' meme, which inspired touching vignettes of government agents who they assumed were monitoring all of their activity and devices. (For example: The FBI Man who has watched you for years through a hacked webcam sheds a tear as he watches you graduate from high school; the FBI Man who monitors your phone wonders when you will finally find love.)
The FBI Man meme was an early example of what happens when you still have to live under the watchful eye of faraway tech companies and their customers and collaborators. Living without a digital footprint is the only way to avoid compromising your privacy online, and Gen Z has more or less stopped 'trying to tip toe around it,' Curry told The Post in an email, 'because we know we can't avoid it.'
'People our age are on all kinds of different social media platforms and we've heard countless stories about how our information is out there for everyone to see,' Curry wrote. She knows that signing up for an account on Google, for instance, grants the company access to a ton of information about her. She doesn't love that, 'but life without Google? Insane.'
TikTok users can be surprisingly confessional, speaking to the camera as if they're Face Timing with a friend. Even if they know nothing on the app is really private, many young users treat TikTok as a space that exists outside the realm of parents and other authority figures. Confessional content also tends to do well on TikTok. The presence of corporate authorities is also treated as beside the point, with social media influencers on various platforms setting the tone.
'Creators are critical of host platforms and feel that they don't have their best interests at heart,' said Zoë Glatt, a researcher at the London School of Economics who studies content creators. 'However, creators still use these platforms, often to share intimate details of their lives, because they want to communicate with their audience-community (whether these are friends or fans).'
Internet users are hostages of their habits, regardless of generation, and so people who are outraged by the behavior of social media companies (and the behavior their platforms inspire in the rest of us) tend to register their disillusionment by contributing content to the very platforms they are criticizing. Facebook users post articles about Facebook's alleged deceptions of its users. In tweets, Twitter users admonish each other to 'never tweet.'
On TikTok, users make videos that convey concern about the platform's security or criticize the Chinese government and dare TikTok's moderators to take it down. Some feature images of Winnie the Pooh " whose resemblance to Chinese President Xi Jinping became a popular meme, prompting censorship of the cartoon bear in the country. Others discuss the protests in Hong Kong or, like Curry's video, concerns about data privacy. And although some of these videos do appear on the 'for you' feeds of American users, they're merely blips on the app's endless feed of family-friendly hashtag challenges, dance videos to the Home Depot theme song and jokes about boomers.
Some TikTok users are trying to actively test their own concerns about TikTok's Chinese ownership.
David, a 22-year-old TikTok user with about 60,000 followers who is part of a small group of individuals collecting information about censorship on the app, made two videos in recent weeks on China's alarming measures to forcibly assimilate the mostly Muslim Uighur minority, and potential censorship on TikTok, 'as an experiment to see what would get views, what would get response from viewers.' David asked that The Post withhold his last name because he was worried about how TikTok's moderators might respond to his videos.
His videos did well, but it's tough to turn concerns about the future of democracy into a catchy meme: Largely unanswered questions about the implications of a Chinese app attracting a huge audience of young Americans don't make for fun hashtag challenges. And, David worried, talking about those concerns can make you sound a bit conspiracy-minded.
Many TikTok users are aware of the app's Chinese ownership and the resulting complications, but it's more of a 'jokey awareness' from what they're seeing in a few short viral videos. American TikTok content on China is a lot of Winnie the Pooh and relatively little discussion of, for instance, how increasingly forceful crackdowns against pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong have turned a university campus filled with students similar in age to TikTok's core user base into the site of a siege. And that dovetails with the dominant tones of TikTok: confessional, playful and relatively wholesome.
'People are protesting in Hong Kong against the Communist Party and getting beaten and silenced,' Curry says, 'whereas in the U.S., we don't have to think twice about expressing our views.'
TikTok is a space where forgetting about that reality is as easy as flipping to the next video.
'We're all just in too deep, I think,' the college sophomore says. 'And it's hard to break yourself from anything related to social media these days once you're hooked.'

Texto completo: DERRYLIN, Northern Ireland - Kevin Lunney, a 50-year-old businessman from Northern Ireland, was heading home one evening when he became the victim of a prolonged, sadistic and ostentatious assault. Abducted by four masked men, he was driven across the nearby border with the Republic of Ireland, locked in a horse trailer and beaten and tortured for two hours.
One leg was broken in two places with a heavy implement, several fingernails were pulled out and the initials of his employer, Quinn Industrial Holdings, were carved into his chest with a knife. He was then doused with bleach, apparently to destroy forensic evidence, before being dumped on the side of a quiet country road.
History of murder
The Irish borderlands have a history of murder and intimidation, and Ireland’s deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, likened the attack to the “gangland, paramilitary-style, punishment beatings” that were a feature of Northern Ireland’s 30 years of Troubles.
For some, the assault conjured a vision of a grim future along the border, in the event that Britain leaves the European Union without an agreement.
For now, people can cross the border freely and without any need for checks. A so-called no-deal Brexit would be likely to change that: Northern Ireland is a part of the United Kingdom, while the Republic of Ireland will continue to be a EU member state, implying a need for a harder frontier. That new division, many fear, could create ideal conditions for smuggling, and potentially provoke a resurgence of paramilitary intimidation and violence.
Workers attacked
Yet the attack on Lunney appears to have had nothing to do with politics or religion. Instead, this assault was just the most ghastly of dozens of incidents in an eight-year campaign of unpunished arson, vandalism, death threats and assaults against the management of Quinn Industrial, also called the Quinn Group or simply Quinn. The violence has brought into question the ability of Dublin and London to enforce the law on their common border.
At the heart of the matter is the ownership and management of Quinn Industrial, the region’s biggest industrial employer, which straddles the border between Derrylin in Northern Ireland and Ballyconnell in the south.
Lunney, the operations director at Quinn, was part of a mainly local management team that rescued the business and its 830 jobs with financial backing from the United States after the group’s flamboyant self-made founder, Sean Quinn, went bankrupt in 2011.
Local hero
Once Ireland’s richest man, Quinn had leveraged a successful construction business into a global insurance, hotel, health care and real estate empire worth an estimated $6 billion in 2008.
The business investment and thousands of jobs that Quinn brought to the impoverished rural counties of Fermanagh and Cavan made him a local hero.
But in 2011, Quinn lost his fortune after investing heavily in shares of Ireland’s now notorious Anglo-Irish Bank, which was itself about to go broke because of reckless property lending, a bank failure that saddled Ireland’s 4.9 million citizens with more than $30 billion in debt.
Since then, Quinn has encouraged the notion that he and his family got a raw deal in the liquidation. He and his sympathizers have blamed his setbacks not on his business decisions but on the machinations of Dublin’s bankers and politicians, as well as his former staff.
Empire liquidated
The attacks on Quinn’s former businesses in Cavan and Fermanagh began as his empire was being liquidated in 2011, and were accompanied by anonymous threatening messages calling for the local management, many of them his former assistants, to hand the company back to him.
At a public meeting last year, a tearful Quinn told hundreds of local supporters - some of them still employees at QIH - that he “felt stabbed in the back” by his former executives.
Quinn has repeatedly condemned the intimidation and attacks, including the assault on Lunney.
A statement released by the Quinn family said, “We have had no involvement in the Quinn Group for several years now and are deeply frustrated and angered that our former ownership of those businesses is being associated in any way with such abhorrent acts.”
In a recent rare TV interview, with Britain’s Channel 4 News, Quinn said that he had “no hand act or part, or no knowledge or no gain” in the attack on Lunney, and that it had caused him to give up his ambition to regain control of his former companies. “People can say whatever they want about me, but I don’t want to be seen to be the beneficiary of abuse or criminal activity.”
Despite Quinn’s repeated condemnations, the campaign has continued. Ten days after his TV interview, a masked man wearing a costume associated with paramilitaries fighting British control in Northern Ireland issued a new letter threatening Quinn Industrial’s owners and management.
‘Last warning’
“This is your last warning to resign to the directors of Q.I.H., obviously you haven’t learned your lesson after what happened to Kevin. If we wanted we could have killed him very easily,” the statement read. “The Quinn family that employed hundreds of people were stabbed in the back and we have the capability and manpower to see this through until the end and achieve a permanent solution.”
Liam McCaffrey, the company’s chief executive, said that he felt he and his fellow managers had been too reticent in the past about speaking out against the campaign, and that the authorities in Dublin and Belfast had been slow to respond.
“It was underestimated and not taken seriously at the highest level,” he said. “There was a feeling that it was a local issue and it would just go away. What happened to Kevin has changed that. There is more effort now, but they are having to catch up.”

Cretton's 'Mercy' a movie of heroes

Texto completo: When Destin Daniel Cretton begins filming Marvel's highly anticipated "Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings" in the new year, he'll consider it the second superhero movie he will have made.
The first is "Just Mercy" starring Michael B. Jordan as civil rights defense lawyer Bryan Stevenson, whose careerlong crusade to save individuals from the death penalty and effect criminal justice reform is about to get its own origin story onscreen.
After an awards-qualifying run in limited release beginning Christmas Day, the film will open nationwide on Jan. 10. But the attorney and activist at the center of "Just Mercy" entered the Hollywood spotlight in August after a special screening of the film in Los Angeles, when Cretton and actors Jordan, Brie Larson and Jamie Foxx -- all of whom have Marvel movies on their resumes -- assembled for an emotional Q&A. They were joined by Stevenson, who drew the biggest applause.
Based on the 2014 New York Times bestselling memoir "Just Mercy: A Story of Justice and Redemption," the film stars Jordan as the Delaware-born Stevenson, an eager young attorney whose compassion is awakened while working with clients on death row in the Deep South.
Foxx co-stars as Walter McMillian, an African American pulpwood worker sent to Alabama's death row in 1988 for the murder of a white woman, who maintains his innocence as his clock ticks down and his tenuous hopes for exoneration fade.
Directing a script he wrote with Andrew Lanham, Cretton tracks Stevenson's fight to overturn McMillian's death sentence and those of other inmates sentenced to die in Alabama, the only U.S. state that does not provide postconviction legal aid to the condemned.
It charts the early work with advocate Eva Ansley (Larson) that led to the 1989 founding of the Equal Justice Initiative, a nonprofit dedicated to battling racial and economic injustice, mass incarceration and excessive punishment.
Oscar-nominated producer Gil Netter ("The Blind Side," "Life of Pi") optioned "Just Mercy" and approached Cretton to direct. Cretton read the book and found himself crying -- and, to his surprise, laughing -- in coffee shops as he pored over Stevenson's elegantly pointed and poignant writing.
"These characters are so human, and I just felt like I knew them," Cretton remembered. "I felt like they were my friends. By the end of this book, where you're confronted with so many harsh truths, you expect to be depressed. But I somehow felt really hopeful and inspired."
Now based in Los Angeles and father to a toddler, Cretton admits he didn't always feel that way. "To me it's really hard to be both informed and yet hopeful ... and that, to me, is the power of Bryan Stevenson and his work."

Texto completo: Cue the misogyny. Again.
The latest example comes from a poll of registered voters in six states expected to play outsize roles in the 2020 presidential race. Nearly four in 10 (38%) of these potentially pivotal voters agreed with this overtly sexist statement: "Sometimes, it feels like most women who run for president just aren't that likable."
The very statement, posited in a recent New York Times-Siena College poll, is at once infuriating and comical, blatantly sexist and rather preposterous. This is, after all, the first time in U.S. history that one might reasonably ask any question involving most women. And while it is not the first time one might credibly ask whether the plethora of men who run for president are likable, the mere thought of that question is, well, not thought of.
Pollsters have long tried to assess whether voters felt comfortable with candidates. Gallup first asked whether each candidate was likable in 1976. Many polls have asked whom you'd prefer to grab a beer with. But those questions addressed each individual candidate (male and, when there was one, female) and didn't conjoin – much less ridicule – a minority of them.
This presidential election, which comes during the centennial of women's voting rights, has drawn a record number of women seeking a major-party nomination (now five, after Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York ended her campaign). Yet we have one question – framed in the negative – that lumps them all together.
As Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics, told me, "This is the thing that plagues and haunts women: Are they likable enough?"
Why would more than 1,400 of the 3,766 registered voters in the poll bite on a question like this? Why would they agree, either strongly or somewhat, that most women presidential candidates are unlikable?
"I'm not sure if it's just these candidates, just these women, or a deep-seated resentment," said Meghann Crawford, a pollster for Siena College.
Let's contemplate that. How well, exactly, do the respondents know most of the women? What traits do they think Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and self-help guru Marianne Williamson share? What could possibly make most of them unlikable? What, really, do they have in common?
And what of the dozen men who are vying for the Democratic nomination? What about the four men competing for the GOP nomination, including Donald Trump? Are most of them unlikable? Are any of them? The poll didn't ask.
It has long been a given that women in politics and elsewhere (read: everywhere) are held to different standards than men, particularly when they seek or attain power. They not only have to be overqualified, they also have to be assertive (not aggressive), smart (not haughty) and serious (but not too much). They also should be nurturing (but not smothering), empathetic (but not tearful) and able to laugh (but not cackle) at themselves (and at the sexist jokes that undoubtedly will come their way). Oh, and they shouldn't be too ambitious (read: like the men who set the standards).
If they are too (fill in the blank), they definitely will be unlikable.
Notably, women are tougher on other women than men are: 43% of women – versus one-third of men – said most of the women who run for president are unlikable.
One woman, Elysha Savarese of Florida, told The Times that female presidential candidates are "super unlikable."Savarese said Warren, the top-polling woman, has body language that is "off-putting."
"She's very cold," said Savarese, 26. "She's basically a Hillary Clinton clone."
Which is fitting. Apparently, there is only one presidential candidate in all of American history to whom we can compare Warren. It is not other Massachusetts senators, like John or Teddy Kennedy, Calvin Coolidge or John Kerry. It is not another academic like Woodrow Wilson, or a law professor like William Howard Taft. It's not eggheads like Adlai Stevenson or Barack Obama. No, Warren either is or is not the new Clinton, the one woman a major party has nominated to the highest office in the land.
Let's be clear: When we compare Warren to Clinton, we're not comparing their policies, which are relatively dissimilar. We're comparing their personas. Or, rather, stereotypes of women's personas. Are they shrill? Are they nasty? Do they grate on you?
Clinton was a lightning rod whom a lot of people liked to dislike. She won the most votes anyway.
Imagine, then, what other women might do.
If only most of them were likable.

Texto completo: November is National Adoption Awareness Month. Journalist, author and adoptee, Seth Berkman, got a taste of his birth country when the New York Times sent him to report on the United Korean women's hockey team. Consisting of players from North and South Korea, select players trained and competed together as teammates at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. Berkman's coverage spurred him to write "A Team of Their Own: How an International Sisterhood Made Olympic History" (Hanover Square Press, $19.99).
An edited version of our conversation follows.

Q: How have your trips for work shaped how you travel?
A: Traveling for work has been one of the privileges of my job. In particular, traveling to smaller cities in America is always intriguing. I often find that it's helpful to capture the ethos of a location, to learn about the subject I'm reporting on. Environment can critically shape who we are. I also enjoy going running in new places. I find that's a great way to explore the intricate nooks of somewhere new.

Q: Where have you been to that you'd like to return to explore further?
A: Seoul. I was born in Seoul, then adopted at a very young age. I didn't go back until February 2018 for the Winter Olympics. I was so busy with work duties on that trip and follow-up reporting trips, I feel like I really haven't had a chance to get to know the city where I was born.

Q: What is your favorite vacation destination?
A: Vienna, Austria. I was lucky enough to live in Vienna for a few months on a fellowship and have immensely enjoyed going back. The city is a wonderful combination of old Europe and new style, which can be seen in their abundance of museums.

Q: What untapped destination should people know about?
A: Fukushima city, Japan. In the fall of 2017, I traveled to Fukushima to report on their preparation for hosting events at the 2020 Olympics (in Tokyo). While many parts of Fukushima are still uninhabitable after the 2011 (nuclear) disaster, the city of Fukushima is a great destination. Not only are there numerous onsens (hot springs) and great local restaurants, there is resonance in the sincerity of the residents and their hopes for more tourism and to change the perception that all of Fukushima is a permanently damaged area.

Q: What's the most important thing you've learned from your travels?
A: I really like to travel alone, because it gives you the freedom to explore at your own pace. I have cultivated some memorable friendships with people I've randomly met on the road, who I probably wouldn't have talked to or bothered to spend the time to get to know if I encountered them in New York. The city hardens you in a way that is not conducive to the best of human nature, so it's important to remember to let down my guard when I'm traveling.

Q: Where are your favorite weekend getaways?
A. I'm not a real weekend getaway person, but I do enjoy jogging in Central Park or running alongside the Hudson River. Go early, though, because these paths become too crowded later in the day.

Q: What is your best vacation memory?
A: On one of my first days in Seoul in February 2018, I randomly met up with a friend of a friend, who showed me around the city and had me run a lot of errands with her. It was a great way to explore. We ended the night in Itaewon until about five in the morning. She's an Olympic athlete and this was like a week before the Games began, so I'll keep her name confidential.

Liquor Commission to build new outlets off I-95

Texto completo: The New Hampshire Liquor Commission plans to construct new liquor and wine outlets on Interstate 95 northbound and southbound in Hampton.

The move would facilitate the sale of 88 acres of property along the highway to create a potential public-private partnership.
The New York Times called the existing northbound outlet a “Must stop vacation destination” due to the wide selection of brand-name, tax-free wines and spirits offered to more than 32.8 million annual motorists who travel the corridor to and from vacation destinations. NHLC operates one of the nation's most profitable and progressive alcohol beverage control states through sales at its 77 outlets.
Initial surveys identified 64 acres along I-95 northbound and 24 acres along I-95 southbound, including wetland and conservation areas. Sale proceeds would provide a benefit for NHLC and thus, state residents. NHLC also anticipates the new outlets would result in sales far surpassing the $54.3 million generated annually between the existing locations.
“This unique and highly valuable real estate along Interstate 95 encompassing our Hampton Liquor & Wine Outlet locations present a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for the state and a developer operator,” said NHLC Chairman Joseph Mollica. “We look forward to identifying a partner that can bring forward a competitive, creative and responsible, New Hampshire-centric proposal that will deliver two new, state-of-the-art N.H. Liquor & Wine Outlet locations and accompanying facilities.”
NHLC will seek a commercial real estate firm experienced in highway-orientated development with the ability to reach potential buyers throughout the country. Once a firm is secured through a Request for Proposal (RFP) process, NHLC will move forward with securing a potential buyer.
The potential buyer, chosen through Request for Qualifications (RFQ) and RFP processes, will have the opportunity to identify potential development scenarios that showcase the two planned 20,000-square-foot northbound and southbound outlets, and identify possible motorist services such as food, fuel and retail offerings.
Each site's location adjacent the Taylor River also provide opportunities to promote environmental education and outdoor experiences.
NHLC will be supported by an advisory committee of relevant state agencies and municipalities that will help guide it through the RFQ and RFP processes. More information will be posted at nh.gov/liquor in coming weeks.
In 2015, a public-private partnership of the NHLC, Granite State Hospitality and state opened the Hooksett Welcome Centers along Interstate 93 north and south. A potential model for Hampton, the project included two 20,000-square-foot N.H. Liquor & Wine Outlet locations, 16,000-square-foot visitor center with a N.H. General Store, Common Man Roadside eateries food court, including the Hi-Way Diner, a Merrimack County Savings Bank branch, League of New Hampshire Craftsmen store, 16 Irving fuel stations, restrooms and more than 300 parking spaces.
NHLC is also relocating its outlet on Portsmouth Avenue in Stratham to the former CVS building across the street from the existing location. The new outlet will offer 8,300 square feet – up from the 5,800 square feet in the existing space – and will feature an expanded selection of wines and spirits. NHLC expects to open the new outlet by early 2020.

Biden, who served for decades in the Senate, also firmly believes in the value of bipartisanship.
And another thing...
Biden was born in Scranton, Pa., in 1942,and moved to Delaware as a child. President Donald Trump has accused Biden of having "deserted"Pennsylvania, to which Biden replies, "I was in third grade."
Cory Booker
|50 years old
|Born in Washington; lives in Newark and Washington |Senator from New Jersey; former city councilman and mayor of Newark
Signature issues
In a political climate dominated by divisiveness, Booker has pitched himself as a healer.Central to his campaign is combating inequality.A champion of the First Step Act, he has called for reversing mass incarceration with a sweeping clemency initiative, expanding affordable housing through tax credits and closing the racial wealth gap with his "baby bonds"proposal.
And another thing...
Booker, the only bachelor in the Democratic field, has been dating actress Rosario Dawson since October 2018 and largely kept their relationship away from politics.

|Former intelligence officer in the Navy Reserve; former consultant for McKinsey&Company
Signature issues
Buttigieg has built his campaign around the idea of generational change.Now 37 years old, he says he would be a bridge to a new era of American politics.Buttigieg was the first candidate to push the idea of increasing the number of seats on the Supreme Court. And he has proved to be one of the most formidable fundraisers in the race.
And another thing...
He's the youngest candidate running, he's the first openly gay candidate to mount a major campaign for the presidency, and he's aiming to be the first mayor to go directly from city hall to the White House.
Tulsi Gabbard
|38 years old
|Born in American Samoa; lives in Kailua, Hawaii, and Washington
|Four-term congresswoman representing Hawaii's Second District, first elected in 2012

Kamala Harris
|55 years old
|Born in Oakland, Calif.; lives in San Francisco and Washington |Elected to the Senate in 2016 |Former attorney general of California; former San Francisco district attorney
Signature issues
Harris has pitched herself as a history-making candidate who can appeal to progressives and moderates.Rather than trying to upend the economy, her policies seek incremental, targeted results, particularly focusing on historically marginalized groups like women, people of color and low-income Americans.She has unveiled middle-class tax cut legislation last fall and championed a liberal civil rights agenda in the Senate.
And another thing...
Harris, who is ofJamaican and Indian descent, attended a historically black college (Howard University), is a member of a
prominent black sorority (Alpha Kappa Alpha) and visited India often while growing up.

He often boasts, correctly, that some of his agenda items once considered radical--Medicare for all, a$15 minimum wage, tuition-free public college--have now been embraced by many Democrats.Running for president a second time, he is one of the most-well known candidates in the race.
And another thing...
According to 10 years of tax returns he released in April, Sanders and his wife, Jane O'Meara Sanders, reported income that topped$1 million in 2016 and 2017, in part from proceeds from his books.

And another thing...
Warren was registered as a Republican until 1996,when she was in her 40s.Warren has said her switch amounted to going from "not political"to "political."
Andrew Yang
|44 years old
|Born in Schenectady, N.Y.; lives in Manhattan
|Former technology executive; founded a nonprofit to create jobs; no prior elected office
Signature issues
Yang says his experience working in Silicon Valley and leading a startup that sought to create jobs gave him an up-close look at the way automation could affect the economy in the years ahead. His solution?To give every American a "universal basic income"of
$1,000a month.

Texto completo: NEW YORK — Kellyanne Conway told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that he embarrassed himself following a tense exchange Thursday where he asked the White House counselor to respond to her husband's criticism of President Trump on television.
Lawyer George Conway has frequently attacked his wife's boss on social media. MSNBC brought him into the studio Wednesday to serve as an analyst during its coverage of the House impeachment hearings.
Blitzer, toward the end of an in-studio interview with Kellyanne Conway on Thursday morning, said he had a sensitive but substantive question for her.
“I don't want to talk about your marriage," he said. “I know there are issues there."
Conway seemed taken aback.
“What did you say?" she asked. “You don't want to talk about my marriage but there are issues there? Why would you say that?"
Conway noted that there was no shortage of Trump critics who appear on CNN and MSNBC and wondered why Blitzer brought up her husband.
“Because he's a legal scholar, he's a lawyer, and he was really going after the president of the United States," Blitzer said. “He was all over television yesterday."
Responded Conway: “And the relevance is, come on, wait for it, drumroll, he's married to me."
CNN rolled a tape of George Conway criticizing Trump for using foreign policy to advance his own interests. It aired on a split screen, as another camera followed his wife's reaction.
Kellyanne Conway said it was “his opinion."
“What you just quoted is said every single day by other voices," Conway said. “But you wanted to put it in my husband's voice because you think somehow that will help your ratings or that you're really sticking it to Kellyanne Conway. And let me make it very clear, you didn't stick it to Kellyanne Conway. I think you embarrassed yourself and I'm embarrassed for you."
MSNBC didn't bring up Kellyanne when her husband was on the air Wednesday, although anchor Brian Williams gave a knowing reference to “yes, that George Conway," when introducing him.

Trump Jr.'s book makes Times' bestseller list
NEW YORK — Donald Trump Jr.'s “Triggered" is a No. 1 New York Times bestseller, although not without an edge.
“Triggered: How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us" came out last week and tops the hardcover nonfiction list that will appear in the Nov. 24 edition of the Times.
Among those celebrating was President Trump, who tweeted, “Wow! Was just told that my son's book, 'Triggered,' is Number One on The New York Times Bestseller List. Congratulations Don!"
A dagger symbol appears next to the listing, indicating that some of the sales were “bulk purchases," often meaning that the author or someone associated with the author bought a substantial number of copies. A spokesman for the Republican National Committee, Steve Guest, said Thursday that the RNC has been offering “Triggered" as a fund-raising incentive, a common practice for political books.
Guest said copies were bought "to keep up with demand," not in a "large bulk purchase."
“Triggered" also placed high on the weekly report compiled by NPD BookScan, which tracks around 85 percent of the print market. According to BookScan, “Triggered" sold 71,000 copies last week, second only to Jeff Kinney's latest “Diary of a Wimpy Kid." NPD could not immediately determine how many of those sales were bulk sales.

Texto completo: There's a cost to caring too much.
Two prominent mental health counselors – a resilience expert at an Ivy League college and a megachurch pastor – died by suicide in September. At the 2017 U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation's Health Means Business summit, Arianna Huffington, sleep evangelist and author of "The Sleep Revolution: Transforming Your Life, One Night at a Time," said people who toil in the charitable space often have the most trouble detaching from work and, well, going to bed.
Meanwhile, Justin Phillips, a mother who lost her son to a drug overdose, is trying to start the #chooseempathy movement. She founded Overdose Lifeline to raise awareness that addiction is not a choice and requires empathetic responses.
Dr. Judith Orloff, a psychiatrist and self-described empath, agrees society needs more empathy given the rising rates of addiction, suicide and mental illness, among other challenges. But she cautions those who choose to be empathic – or find it comes naturally – about the need to care for themselves first.
The New York Times best-selling author's new book, "Thriving as an Empath: 365 Days of Self-Care for Sensitive People" (Sounds True publishing), is now in stores.
Here, she talks with USA TODAY health policy reporter Jayne O'Donnell, who calls herself an "overempathizer."
Question: How do you know if you are an empath? What are the character traits?
Dr. Judith Orloff: Ordinary empathy is the ability to feel someone else's pain as well as their joy, the ability for us to be open-hearted. It's such a beautiful trait. Being an empath, however, goes further. Empaths have extremely sensitive neurological systems and don't have the usual filters that other people have, so they feel things intensely and often are emotional sponges who take on other people's stress if they don't learn how to set boundaries and practice other self-care techniques ... Most empaths are introverts like myself, but some are extroverts who love socializing but still need to decompress afterwards to take care of themselves.
As part of my research on empaths, I developed a 20-question self-assessment test in my earlier book, "The Empath's Survival Guide," to determine if you are an empath. Some of the questions include: Have I been labeled as overly sensitive? (in a derogatory way). Do crowds drain me, and do I need a lot of alone time to replenish myself? Do I take on other people's stress or emotions? Do I replenish myself in nature? Am I super-sensitive to noise, smells and excessive talking?
Q: There's a clear need for more empathy in our country, isn't there?
Orloff: I believe empathy is the most precious trait in human nature. We need more of it in our country and in the world. Empathy is the ability to put yourself in someone else's shoes so you can see their point of view. Empathy is so powerful because it opens our hearts. It allows us to try to understand another person's position, even if we don't particularly like them or if we disagree on an issue. This gives us the best chance of successfully communicating with them and resolving differences.
Q: But there are risks in caring too much, aren't there?
Orloff: Yes, I've seen many of my patients, including empaths and all sensitive people, care too much and become burned out by empathy overload – or get involved with addictions, including substances, food and sex to numb themselves out. In my psychotherapy practice, there has been an epidemic of empathic patients consulting me who are exhausted, anxious, depressed and overwhelmed by added stress in their personal lives, which is aggravated by our world's non-stop stress.
Arianna Huffington reports that over two-thirds of doctors in the U.S. say they are burned out, depressed or both! Those in the helping professions have trouble turning stress off so they also tend to experience impaired sleep and increased anxiety.
Q: What are the most effective ways for empaths to establish boundaries?
Orloff: Taking adequate alone time is essential to decompress. When my empath patients go nonstop in their jobs or as parents – without periodically slowing down – they risk chronic exhaustion, anxiety and overwhelm. Scheduling mini-breaks in your life to take a few deep breaths, spending some quiet time without phone calls, demands or over-stimulation, taking a walk or meditating for even a few minutes will break the momentum of stress and prevent sensory overload. Also I teach all my patients that "no is a complete sentence."
Q: Shouldn't we all try to be better listeners and responders to those going through hard times?
Orloff: Being a caring listener is one of the great empathic gifts we can give others. But we don't have to listen for hours on end. Giving someone your caring attention for five to 10 minutes can be very potent, as opposed to getting hooked into repetitive two-hour phone conversations that wear you out. "I love you and I will be thinking of you" is a wonderful thing to say after responding to the person for a limited time. Also, I recommend having short check-ins with the person. A technique I suggest is the "3 Minute Phone Call." This is when you tell the person you're available for this period of time and you want to support them.
As an empathic person, you adore giving, but what I hope my book will provide you with are strategies to give in healthy ways – but also practice self-care so you can be a balanced, happy person.

Rivals expected to gang up on Buttigieg in next 2020 Democratic debate

Texto completo: Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren have been debate targets of rival 2020 Democrats at candidate face-offs in recent months. Now, it may be Pete Buttigieg's turn.
The Atlanta debate on Wednesday, sponsored by the Democratic National Committee, offers opponents of the South Bend, Indiana, mayor a chance to take him down a peg after some polls have shown the 37-year-old surging. His rise, less than three months out from the first nominating contests, the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 3 and the New Hampshire primary on Feb. 11, have moved him closer to the top tier of 2020 Democrats, which includes Biden, the former vice president, Warren, a Massachusetts senator, and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
A Monmouth University poll released this week found Buttigieg leading the rest of the Democratic field in Iowa, with 22% support in the state, a 14-point increase since the same poll was conducted in August. A RealClearPolitics average of primary polls put his support at 19.7% support in Iowa, a statistical tie with Warren, who sits at first with 20%.
"There’s no question he’ll receive attacks in the upcoming Democratic debate. Biden was the target in the first debate and Warren last time," Aaron Kall, director of debate at the University of Michigan, told the Washington Examiner. "The polls are important, but the amount and kind of attention Buttigieg gets will kind of serve as an accurate representation of what the candidates really think of him."

Despite relatively low national polling, Buttigieg's campaign has one of the largest war chests of any Democrat running for president, with nearly $23.5 million. That money has surely made other Democratic campaigns nervous, as Buttigieg just announced a $2 million ad buy in South Carolina, which hosts a Feb. 29 primary.
Reports have surfaced that a number of Democrats find Buttigieg particularly irksome, citing his lack of experience but impressive funding. This week, the New York Times reported that Biden mockingly greeted Buttigieg with, "Hello, Mr. President," in "a voice dripping with condescension."
Candidates' pent-up frustration about Buttigieg's rise may emerge on the debate stage Wednesday, Kall said.

"There may be some personal disdain between the other candidates and Pete Buttigieg. The could release some of the deeper feelings the candidates have," Kall said. "Buttigieg needs to be aware of what could happen. Warren and Biden weren’t prepared for attacks by other candidates, and both of them suffered as a result." Kall said.
Buttigieg may be able to thrust and parry the expected jabs to his advantage, Kall said.
"The attacks could be somewhat positive for Buttigieg. He doesn’t have the accompanying issue like healthcare, like Warren did," Kall said about rivals' criticism of Warren's "Medicare for all" plan, which would effectively eliminate private health insurance in favor of a government program. "Attacks would just be about his age and inexperience, his polling with black voters, or racial issues in South Bend. Those are definitely serious things, but he should prepare like that’s going to be the case even if it doesn’t happen."

Already, liberal groups are signaling that Buttigieg's rise won't come without extensive scrutiny from the Left. Justice Democrats, the left-wing group that helped fund the rise of New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, released a statement Wednesday attacking Buttigieg's position on "Medicare for all."
“Buttigieg was for 'Medicare for all' before he was against it,” said Waleed Shahid, spokesman for the group. “He realized he was never going to beat Warren and Sanders as a progressive. He got scared of the fight. He realized he could raise tons of cash from corporate executives in the pharmaceutical and insurance industry.”
Some Democrats, however, cautioned that any attention on Buttigieg could backfire and raise his profile.
"The Democrats don’t want to give Buttigieg the oxygen he needs to vault into the top tier. I think he’s still somewhat of an outlier, despite the poll in Iowa," said Democratic strategist Jim Manley. "I think Democrats need to think long and hard about whether they want to really give this guy the kind of attention he wants."

David Brooks: In praise of Washington insiders

Texto completo: Let me tell you a secret. The public buildings of Washington are filled with very good people working hard for low pay and the public good. There are thousands of them and they are very much like the Foreign Service officers that we’ve seen or are expected to see testifying at the impeachment hearings: William Taylor, George Kent, Marie Yovanovitch and Fiona Hill.
These public servants tend to be self-effacing and deeply knowledgeable about some small realm of public policy. They’re generally not all that interested in partisan politics but are deeply committed to the process and substance of good government. Whenever I get to sit in on off-the-record meetings at this or that federal agency, I’m impressed by the quality, professionalism and basic goodness of the people there.
We don’t celebrate these people. Trumpian conservatives say that Washington insiders are unelected bureaucrats, denizens of the swamp, the cesspool or a snake pit. Some progressives call Washington insiders the establishment, the power elite, the privileged structures of the status quo.
Everybody who runs for office wants to be seen as an outsider and condemns the insiders. That is, until weeks like this one when we realize how much we need them.
At this week’s hearings, the civil servant witnesses answering questions inspired a lot more confidence than the elected officials who were asking them. Why are they so impressive? It’s precisely because they are Washington insiders. The witnesses have worked in a long line of institutions — the State Department, the World Bank, the Brookings Institution, the National Security Council.
For all their flaws, these institutions possess what political scientist Hugh Heclo called “sedimented deposits” of inherited knowledge. If you are a Foreign Service officer long enough, you learn to think like a Foreign Service officer. You absorb the skills, practices and moral codes you need to do the work well. When someone breaks the code, you know immediately, and if you are brave enough, like the whistleblower, you move to defend the code.
When public servants enter government, they shed their private interests to serve a public role. A great question of the Trump years is whether our institutions can survive a president who is incapable of thinking outside his own private interest. Donald Trump uses public office as a gold mine to extract personal advantage.
As Yuval Levin writes in his profound forthcoming book, “A Time to Build,” Trump is an example of a person who wasn’t formed by an institution. He is self-created and self-enclosed. He governs as a perpetual outsider, tweeting insults to members of his own Cabinet. At its best, the impeachment process is an attempt to protect our institutions from his inability to obey the rules.
The wider disease here is “outsiderism” itself. For a half-century our culture has celebrated the rebel, not the organization man; the free individual, not the institutionalist. That’s fine and in many cases good, but over the decades this outsider pose has hardened into an immature cynicism: Everybody’s corrupt. No one is to be trusted.
“The populism of this moment in our politics is fundamentally antinomian, mistrustful of authority, and cynical about all claims to integrity,” Levin writes in “A Time to Build.” “Our age combines a populism that insists all of our institutions are rigged against the people with an identity politics that rejects institutional commitments and a celebrity culture that chafes against all structure and constraint.”
All around the world voters are electing comedians, celebrities and outsider performers to high office. All around the world people are responding to demagogues who tell them that our problems are easy to solve if we just get rid of the bad people. Everywhere rule-breakers like Trump, Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Nicolás Maduro are in power and corruption is in the air.
People have messed-up theories of how you do social change. On the right many think that you need to elect some authoritarian strongman who will whip everybody into shape. On the left many put their faith in social movements, without explaining how social movements are going to write and pass legislation.
In reality, institutions are the only vehicles for legislative change. That’s because they are the way to wield power safely. They have rules and structures and norms precisely because power is so dangerous when it is wielded by a lone strongman or by a mob.
People have lost faith in institutions for some very good reasons, and the need to reform them is urgent. But the disenchantment is overblown and self-destructive. We don’t pay enough attention to all the planes that take off and land safely. We underestimate the value of experience. As Heclo writes in “On Thinking Institutionally,” “It is when you deal with someone who does not perform in a ‘professional’ manner that you learn to appreciate those who do.”
Watching Taylor and Kent, I had a feeling of going back in time. Why did it feel so strange? It was because I was looking at people who are not self-centered. They’ve dedicated themselves to the organization that formed them, and which they serve.

Texto completo: Usuarios en redes sociales como Twitter han llamado a un boicot al canal de televisión VH1 luego de que la empresa anunciara que Emma Coronel, esposa del convicto narcotraficante Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán Loera, aparecerá en un episodio de la segunda temporada del “ reality show” “Cartel Crew “.
“VH1 tiene que ser boicoteado por tratar de darle glamur a estupideces como carteles de la droga / distribuidores de burdeles matones y criminales. Nosotros no necesitamos este tipo de mierda”, dijo en un tuit Esther Ramos.
VH1 has to be boycotted by glamorizing stupidities like drug cartels/dealers brothels thugs and criminals. we don't need this type of CRAP https://t.co/QxxfG0H1YH

Otros disgustados por la presencia de la exreina de belleza en el episodio de este próximo 18 de noviembre criticaron el hecho de que con el destaque de la esposa del exlíder del Cartel de Sinaloa se “glorifica” al narco.
“¿Por qué diablos están glorificando a la esposa de El Chapo? Cientos de personas han sufrido por esta familia y su cartel. Pero, oye, ¿a quién le importa la moral cuando tienes que producir ‘shows’ de mierda para hacer dinero, cierto?”.
@MTV @VH1 @Viacom Why the hell are you glorifying El Chapo’s wife? Thousands of people have suffered because of this family and cartel. But hey, who care about morals when you have to produce crap shows to make some money, right?
— Esther Ramos (@MBMBaMino) November 13, 2019
Why is @VH1 putting el chapo wife on tv? I mean, I know *why* (ratings and money) but what the fuck?! after the recent murders related to cartel and innocents being killed, it's really tone deaf. time to flush the state of media at this point
— rob (@goof) November 13, 2019
Las críticas no se han limitado a usuarios que no son figuras públicas. El escritor especializado en temas criminales y de narcos, Don Winslow, con éxitos de ventas del New York Times, catalogó de “asquerosa” la decisión del canal.
“Esto es realmente asqueroso”, compartió en un tuit el autor en el que etiquetó al servicio de televisión por suscripción.
Por su parte, el periodista mexicano Ioan Grillo retuitió el mensaje de Winslow al que agregó que es una “decisión enferma y terrible de VH1”, ya que el cartel ha creado una “catástrofe humanitaria en México ”.
This is a sick and terrible decision by VH1 to have El Chapo's wife Emma Coronel on its reality show "Cartel Crew." There is a humanitarian catastrophe in Mexico from cartel violence. This is not a glamorous reality show. Where are images of mass graves?https://t.co/MaLGUquIIM
— Ioan Grillo (@ioangrillo) November 12, 2019
El Chapo cumple una sentencia de cadena perpetua más 30 años tras ser declarado culpable el 12 de febrero pasado en la corte federal de Brooklyn, en Nueva York . El mexicano fue hallado culpable de los 10 cargos en su contra por parte de un jurado de 12 miembros que deliberó por seis días e incluso pidió copia de varios testimonios y aclaraciones específicas al juez sobre detalles de la evidencia.
Durante, aproximadamente, tres meses de juicio en la sala del juez Brian Cogan, 14 de los antiguos colaboradores de Guzmán, y otros 42 testigos de la Fiscalía hablaron sobre los crimenes del acusado.
Algunos de los cargos que pesaban contra el narco eran: participación en una empresa criminal continua, conspiración internacional para manufacturar y distribuir cocaína, heroína, metanfetamina y marihuana, y uso de armas de fuego.
Actualmente, Guzmán Loera permanece en la prisión de máxima seguridad en Florence, Colorado, mejor conocida como ADX o como el “Alcatraz de las Rocosas”.

Texto completo: WARNING: Parts of this column may bear strong resemblance to my earlier columns when Michael Bloomberg toyed with running for president, because with Bloomberg, history has a way of repeating itself. Every four years, Michael Bloomberg hears something virtually no other American hears: a groundswell of support for a Michael Bloomberg presidential candidacy. Now, as the 2020 Democratic primaries rapidly approach, he’s hearing it again.
Bloomberg, a fairly successful mayor of New York and a fabulously successful businessman, has an estimated net worth of $52 billion. Without that fortune, nobody would be talking about a Bloomberg candidacy at this late date. But with his money, Bloomberg could self-finance a run from start to finish without ever having to ask a single donor for a penny. This time, Bloomberg, who in his political life has been a Democrat, a Republican, an independent and now a Democrat again, is setting a personal record by flirting twice in a single cycle. Last spring, there was a ripple of speculation about a 2020 Bloomberg candidacy. On March 5, Bloomberg put an end to it when he announced flatly, "I’m not running for president." Instead, he said, he would pour his energy and resources into a new climate change project called Beyond Carbon. Now, however, he has apparently moved beyond Beyond Carbon. Last week, The New York Times reported that Bloomberg is "actively preparing to enter the Democratic presidential primary."
Bloomberg is said to be concerned — and it is a legitimate concern — that the current Democratic field has moved too far left. But there is no indication that voters believe Bloomberg is the solution to the problem. This latest tease is too recent for any reliable polling — although one survey found Bloomberg with the highest negatives in the field — but in the past, he has never been a voter favorite outside the confines of New York City.
Bloomberg is being pressed into action by states with early primary filing deadlines. He has already placed his name on the ballot for the Alabama primary, and a short time later flew to Arkansas to file there. Alabama and Arkansas are fine, but what about Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina — the first states to cast votes and award delegates? Bloomberg has apparently decided to blow them off.
Candidates in the past have sometimes tried to skip an early primary or caucus, but skipping all four at the beginning is a sure way to lose.
Bloomberg’s move is a symptom of Democratic anxiety. We’ve seen it before, in both parties. At the beginning of a primary season, with a big field of candidates starting the race, the party faithful say, "Isn’t this great? We have so many good candidates — almost an embarrassment of riches!" Then, after several months of campaigning, they say, "Can’t somebody enter this race and save us?"
The answer is no. The Democratic field is what it is. One of the candidates in the race right now will win the nomination, go on to face President Donald Trump, and have a chance to become the next president. There’s no savior waiting to rescue Democrats — and that includes Michael Bloomberg.

U.N. Inquiry on Syria Hospital Bombings Might Be Undermined by Russia

Texto completo: The United Nations is investigating attacks on seven humanitarian sites in Syria. Diplomats say Russia is trying to keep the U.N. findings secret.
The aerial bombings of hospitals in rebel areas of Syria have long stood out as possible war crimes, so brazen that the leader of the United Nations ordered a special inquiry three months ago, raising hope of some accountability.
But with evidence accumulating that the Syrian government's Russian allies are responsible for some of those bombings, the opposite appears to be happening.
The scope of the inquiry has so far been limited to just seven sites among the many targeted, according to an internal United Nations document seen by The New York Times.
At the same time, diplomats say Russia has been pressing the global organization's leader, Secretary General António Guterres, not to release the conclusions of even this narrow inquiry.
And in what appears to be a new sign of impunity, one of the targets on the inquiry's list, Kafr Nabl Surgical Hospital -- an underground facility that Russian pilots bombed at least once before, according to a New York Times investigation -- appears to have been bombed by the Russians again on Nov. 6.
[Read how we investigated Russia's previous bombing of Kafr Nabl Surgical Hospital.]
The incidents under investigation include a possible bombing of Kafr Nabl in July, but not the attacks on Kafr Nabl and three other hospitals on May 5-6, which the Times investigation concluded had been carried out by Russia. All four hospitals also were on a list of sites that should not be attacked, known as a deconfliction list, sent by the United Nations to countries fighting in Syria, including Russia.
The Times used witness accounts and videos, time-coded cockpit recordings of Russian pilots, plane spotter logs and security camera footage from Kafr Nabl to trace the follow-up attack on Nov. 6 to Russia. The times that one pilot confirms strikes in the cockpit recordings match the times the hospital was hit.
Kafr Nabl, in northwest Syria's Idlib province, was hit by three airstrikes and rendered temporarily out of service in the latest attack. No one was killed or wounded, according to a doctor there.
A spokesman for Vassily Nebenzia, Russia's United Nations ambassador, did not respond to the Times's request for comment about accusations that Russia had sought to pressure Mr. Guterres to keep the inquiry confidential. The spokesman instead pointed to public comments made by Mr. Nebenzia on Sept. 16 when he objected to what he described as disinformation about the Syrian and Russian military campaign. Mr. Nebenzia also said the inquiry should examine the United Nations deconfliction list, suggesting it was flawed.
"Nobody denies that there are also civilians in Idlib, and that they live in dire conditions, some of them going through second or even third round of relocation. However, there is no other way to resolve their suffering, but to liberate this area from jihadists, who simply hold those civilians as a shield to protect their own positions," Mr. Nebenzia said.
Russia is the most important ally of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, and is largely responsible for helping his forces as they move to destroy the last vestiges of a Western-backed rebellion that had once threatened to topple him at the height of the war, now in its ninth year.
Since the end of April, Syria and Russia have been concentrating their firepower on northwest Syria, the remaining chunk of rebel-held territory.
Rupert Colville, a spokesman for the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, said last Friday that at least 61 medical facilities in that area had been hit so far. He expressed alarm that "health facilities continue to be directly hit or significantly damaged" even as the United Nations panel is investigating.
Mr. Guterres established a board of inquiry on Aug. 1 after 10 members of the Security Council, including the United States, expressed alarm at the attacks on hospitals. Diplomats say Mr. Guterres was initially reluctant but relented, and is now facing pressure from Russia to keep the inquiry's findings a secret.
Farhan Haq, a spokesman for Mr. Guterres, said the United Nations is still considering how to handle the inquiry's findings, when asked if the conclusions would be made public.
It would not be the first time that the Russians have sought to suppress or at least discredit any international finding that impugns the war conduct of the Kremlin or its Syrian ally. Two years ago, for example, Russia blocked Western attempts to extend the life of a United Nations-backed panel investigating chemical weapons attacks in Syria, after it had found the Syrian government responsible for a lethal aerial assault in the village of Khan Sheikhoun, which would be a war crime. The Russians called the panel's research methods shoddy and had earlier warned its leader that the conclusion was unacceptable.
Hospitals, clinics, doctors and other medical workers have long been considered exempt from attack in the rules of war, regardless of who they are treating. Provisions of the Geneva Conventions specify that the wounded and sick shall be cared for and respected. While such principles have been violated in many conflicts, human rights advocates say the transgressions in Syria have been especially egregious.
Any effort by Russia to suppress the hospital bombing inquiry, if successful, would extend the Kremlin's record of blocking or impeding action at the United Nations that the Russians deem harmful to Mr. al-Assad's side.
Russia has vetoed 13 Security Council resolutions calling for action on Syria. In September, Russia blocked a demand for a cease-fire in the northwest of the country, the same area the Russian Air Force is currently bombing.
Rights groups have expressed hope that the United Nations investigation of the hospital bombings would at least provide unassailable information that would point to who had carried them out. But some expressed dismay that the inquiry is so limited.
Susannah Sirkin, director of policy at Physicians for Human Rights, an advocacy group that monitors attacks on medical facilities, said her organization was "gravely concerned that the Secretary-General's initiative may lack the depth or breadth to effectively answer why civilian facilities were bombed, who was responsible, and how to prevent such attacks in the future."
Others are pressing Mr. Guterres to ignore any attempts to suppress the findings.
"The victims, their families, and the world at large have a right to know the facts," said Louis Charbonneau, the United Nations director at Human Rights Watch. "Keeping silent will only embolden those responsible for war crimes in Syria."
Diplomats say they expect the inquiry's final report to be finished by the end of the year.
Reporting was contributed by Christiaan Triebert, Evan Hill, Dmitriy Khavin, Malachy Browne, Alexandra Koroleva and Abeer Pamuk.

A Purported Identity Still Circulates Online

Texto completo: The sites said they would delete posts that include the purported name of the Ukraine whistle-blower. But the name keeps reappearing.
SAN FRANCISCO -- A week ago, YouTube and Facebook said they would block people from identifying the government official thought to be the whistle-blower who set in motion an impeachment inquiry into President Trump.
It hasn't worked out so well. A name believed by some to be the whistle-blower has been shared thousands of times on Facebook. Videos discussing the identity of the whistle-blower have been watched by hundreds of thousands of people on YouTube. And images professing to be of the person have circulated on Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, under dozens of different hashtags.
The purported name of the whistle-blower appeared on Facebook pages that, combined, were followed by over half a million Facebook users, according to CrowdTangle, a tool that analyzes interactions across the site. It is unclear how many of those users saw the post, but the name was easily searchable within various Facebook pages, including right-wing news sites and an individual running for Congress.
The failure to keep this official's name off social media is the latest indication of how difficult it is for these companies to police their sprawling platforms. Armies of human content moderators and screening with artificial intelligence have often proved unfit for the task, particularly when many people are intent on breaking the rules.
A mishmash of policies and lack of coordination among the companies have added to the challenge. Facebook and YouTube said they would block attempts to name the whistle-blower, but Twitter said naming him would not violate their policies, so long as posts did not also have more personal information, like an address or phone number.
"The policies created by the social media companies look great in isolation. They look great on paper. But each time something like this happens, it shows the problems of each company acting in a silo," said Claire Wardle, executive director of First Draft, an organization that fights online disinformation. "Companies don't yet have a way to do this in a way that is effective, and something more than Whac-a-Mole."
YouTube and Facebook said they would remove any mentions of the whistle-blower's name from their sites because naming the whistle-blower violated their so-called coordinated harm policies, which prohibit content intended to out a "witness, informant or activist." The companies would not say how many posts they have taken down.
But Facebook users, for example, have been creative in their efforts to sidestep the company's content moderation. They have avoided using the name within the text of their posts, which could alert A.I. systems screening for it. Instead, they have included it in the URL or inside an image. Others intentionally added characters such as dollar-signs and asterisks to avoid Facebook's automated moderation.
Twitter, notably, didn't block naming the whistle-blower. That allowed Donald Trump Jr., who has over four million followers, to tweet a name. Numerous conservative commentators spread Mr. Trump's tweet, and began sharing images and videos on social media channels that they believed showed the person's identity.
YouTube had taken additional steps to make it difficult to search for the name, removing an autocomplete feature that filled in the name once a person began typing it. If, however, the whistle-blower's full name was already known, users could easily find it.
On Tuesday morning, the top three videos claiming to share the whistle-blower's name each had over 100,000 views. The videos often avoided using the name in the title over the video. Instead, they shared it in the comments and discussions below the video, where people also linked to blogs discussing the identity. Many videos with the name were taken down after The New York Times asked YouTube about them.
Facebook was unwilling to comment on whether it was seeing a coordinated effort to spread the whistle-blower's name, but said it would continue to take down content that violated its policies. YouTube did not respond to a request for comment on the videos being shared on its site.
On Instagram, photographs purporting to show the whistle-blower with a number of public figures from the Democratic Party were also widely shared. Earlier in the week, Instagram had blocked searches for the last name being circulated, or for the hashtag #whistle-blower. But on Thursday, it was possible to search on that hashtag, as well as the purported full name or variations of the name. Instagram said it temporarily blocked searches for #whistle-blower while it calibrated its systems to ensure that legitimate searches for the term, or the purported name, were not being affected.
A Twitter spokeswoman said posting names and images did not violate Twitter rules. She said Twitter bans only specific types of private information, such as sharing a person's home address, private phone number or government identification without their consent.
President Trump, and his supporters, have called for the name of the whistle-blower to be made public. On Wednesday, during the House's first public hearing in its impeachment inquiry, Republican members of Congress repeated calls for the whistle-blower to be identified.
The New York Times and most other major news organizations have not named the whistle-blower, though The Times and others reported he was a C.I.A. analyst.
Experts who study the way information moves across social media said that in a number of cases the blogs, photographs and videos were first gaining popularity on Twitter and Reddit, which has also allowed discussions about the whistle-blower's identity.
Users of Twitter and Reddit were also using those sites to coordinate how to spread the whistle-blower's name on other platforms, including Facebook, Instagram and YouTube. On one Reddit channel, dedicated to supporting President Trump, thousands of people voted on and shared methods by which they had successfully posted the purported whistle-blower's name onto Facebook and YouTube.
"The information ecosystem is interconnected and related," Ms. Wardle said. "The minute a piece of information is out anywhere, it is game over; that piece of information can spread anywhere."
Conspiracy theorists and people with fringe beliefs have become adept at using social media to get ahead of news cycles, and sow misinformation before mainstream news organizations can establish verified facts. And they have become skilled at avoiding community standards on social media sites.
In the weeks after the March 15 attack on a New Zealand mosque, for example, violent videos of the attack flooded Facebook, YouTube and other social media channels. Facebook said on Wednesday that it had taken down 4.5 million pieces of content related to that episode between March 15 and Sept. 30.
"Here we are, in the midst of impeachment hearings, and we are witnessing the real time seeding of a story line by conspiracy theorists through social media," said Joan Donovan, a research director at Harvard University's Shorenstein Center.
Sharing the potential identity of the whistle-blower also helps bring together people with like-minded views, said Ms. Donovan. Communities formed online to spread certain types of content tend to work together again and again, creating organized campaigns aimed at overwhelming social media companies.
Companies don't have the technology yet to take down every piece of banned content as it is uploaded, Ms. Wardle said. And when people are able to organize and coordinate on one social media platform to spread information on another, it is nearly impossible to track, she said.
"People are testing the platforms ahead of 2020. This is a perfect moment to see what works, and what doesn't," she said. "So far, we know what doesn't."

Texto completo: Behrouz Boochani, who was held for years as part of Australia's offshore immigration detention program, arrived in New Zealand for a literary festival.
A Kurdish-Iranian refugee and award-winning writer who was held by Australia for years at a detention center on a remote Pacific island arrived in New Zealand late Thursday, after becoming a cause célèbre for rights activists.
The refugee, Behrouz Boochani, 35, who became a prominent voice for the hundreds of people exiled on Manus Island, Papua New Guinea, as part of Australia's controversial detention program, received permission to leave for the first time in years.
The Australian government has paid neighboring countries to detain hundreds of asylum seekers and other refugees who arrive by sea. This is the first time Mr. Boochani has been granted permission to leave Papua New Guinea since his detention began in 2013, after he was given a visitor visa to enter New Zealand to speak at the WORD Christchurch literary festival on Nov. 29.
He was held in a detention center on Manus Island until it closed in 2017, and he was then moved to another part of Papua New Guinea. It is not clear what his status will be after the festival, although he has vowed never to return to Papua New Guinea.
"So exciting to get freedom after more than six years," Mr. Boochani said on Twitter on his arrival at Auckland Airport late on Thursday night. "Thank you," he added, "to all the friends who made this happen."
Mr. Boochani, who worked as a journalist with the Kurdish-language magazine Werya, fled Iran in 2013 after officials raided his office. He traveled to Indonesia and tried to reach Australia by boat, where he planned to seek asylum. But he was intercepted by the authorities.
After being moved to a remote detention camp on Manus Island, he documented rights abuses against the hundreds of asylum seekers held alongside him on Manus Island, where he has spent the last six years, and those on the tiny island nation of Nauru. Many of the detainees were from the Middle East and Africa and were seeking refugee status.
Mr. Boochani's writings raised awareness of the situation on the island, which was largely closed off to international journalists and rights groups. He wrote of daily life on the island, posting updates on social media about squalid conditions at the camp and the suicides and self-harm that became commonplace among the detainees. He revealed inadequate access to heath care, deteriorating facilities and desperation among the men housed there.
He shared details about Manus in 2017 with The New York Times after President Trump walked back promises made by President Barack Obama to relocate all detainees who had received refugee status to the United States. His work was also published by numerous local and international outlets.
"We are under such pressure and a hard situation," he said at the time. "We cannot go back, and we are still here."
Working with a translator for five years via messages in Farsi over WhatsApp, he wrote a book, "No Friend but the Mountains," for which he won the 2019 Victorian Prize for Literature. The prestigious Australian award, selected from a short list of winners in other categories, comes with an award of 125,000 Australian dollars, or about $ 90,000.
He has also won the New South Wales Premier's Award, the Australian Book Industry Award for nonfiction and the National Biography Award.
Human rights groups have long denounced Australia's policy of detaining migrants and asylum seekers in offshore detention centers like the one on Manus, but the government has maintained that it is necessary to deter those arriving in the country by illegal means.
Australia closed the center on Manus Island in 2017 and moved some of the asylum seekers. Others who received official refugee status have been resettled in the United States, but hundreds remain in limbo on the island.
The Australian government said last month that 562 refugees and asylum seekers remain in Papua New Guinea and on Nauru.
Meg de Ronde, the executive director of Amnesty New Zealand, which was involved in obtaining a visitor visa for Mr. Boochani to attend the literary festival, said on Twitter that it was a "life & career highlight to be a small part" of his arrival.
In an earlier statement, Ms. de Ronde said, "This is a spark of hope after he has fled violence and persecution, first in Iran and then from Australian authorities."
On Thursday, the organizers of the festival released a statement on Mr. Boochani's behalf. In it, he said he would continue to speak out against the Australian offshore detention system, "which is designed to deter refugees from seeking asylum and, ultimately, has caused grave harm and torture."
He also said he would ask the government of New Zealand to aid those who remained in Papua New Guinea and Nauru.
Michelle Bachelet, the United Nations rights chief, recently spoke out about Australia's migration and asylum policies in a speech at the Whitlam Institute in Sydney.
"I have a number of serious concerns about migration and asylum policies in this country, including the so-called offshore processing regime and prolonged mandatory detention of refugees and asylum seekers," she said.
Ms. Bachelet added that she feared the public narrative in Australia about migration and asylum "has become weaponized by misinformation and discriminatory and even racist attitudes."

Texto completo: A surprise ruling from the bench is a blow to a bid to bring Hoda Muthana and her 2-year-old son, the child of a slain ISIS fighter, back from a refugee camp in Syria.
WASHINGTON -- A federal judge ruled on Thursday that Hoda Muthana, an American-born woman who joined the Islamic State in 2014 and says she now wants to return home to her family in Alabama, is not an American citizen.
In a surprise ruling from the bench, the judge, Reggie B. Walton of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia, abruptly dismissed a lawsuit brought by her family seeking to force the Trump administration to bring her home from a refugee camp in Syria, along with her 2-year-old son -- the child of a slain ISIS fighter.
The ruling leaves the fate of Ms. Muthana and her child in doubt amid the deteriorating security environment in northern Syria since Turkey invaded territory held by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, a United States ally. The refugee camp in which Ms. Muthana and her son are held is overseen by the S.D.F.
Ms. Muthana's case has been politically charged since Mr. Trump said in a Twitter post in February that he had directed the secretary of state "not to allow Hoda Muthana back into the Country!"
But it has turned on novel issues about when diplomatic immunity ends and an exception to the general rule that anyone born on American soil is automatically a citizen. Ms. Muthana's father, Ahmed Ali Muthana, was a United Nations diplomat from Yemen. Children of people with diplomatic immunity are not automatically granted citizenship despite being born in the United States. But Mr. Muthana was discharged from his diplomatic post shortly before she was born in 1994.
The United States government, however, said it was notified about that change in early 1995, after she was born, and stopped considering him covered by diplomatic immunity only then. The gap raised the question of whether his diplomatic status expired as a matter of law before or after her birth.
Mr. Muthana, who stayed in the United States, later applied for naturalized citizenship for his older children, who had been born abroad, but did not apply for Ms. Muthana because the government had led him to believe she was already a citizen -- including by issuing her a passport, his lawyers have said.
Judge Walton in March rejected a request by Mr. Muthana to speed up consideration of the case. This month, Mr. Muthana filed a new such motion in light of the "upheaval" that followed Mr. Trump's recent announcement of the withdrawal of United States troops from the area, which precipitated the fighting between Turkey and the Kurds.
The motion said that Ms. Muthana had been moved to a different refugee camp, known as Roj, after receiving death threats at the first one where she was held, Al Hol, from Islamic State loyalists for having repudiated the group. It also said her son, identified in court documents only as John Doe, was sickly, and that their lives were in danger.
"The citizenship status of Minor John Doe depends upon the status of Ms. Muthana; accordingly, regardless of the choices made by his mother, the health and survival of a young U.S. citizen depend upon the expeditious resolution of Ms. Muthana's civil case," it said.
Buzzfeed first reported the ruling.
One of the lawyers representing the Muthanas and who was in the courtroom, Christina A. Jump, said the judge ruled that expedited consideration was now appropriate but then ruled that he was bound by the State Department's representation of when Mr. Muthana's diplomatic immunity ended. She said that they would probably appeal once he issued a written ruling.
"While we are disappointed with and disagree with the court's ruling today, this is not the end of our client's legal options," said Ms. Jump, who works for the Constitutional Law Center for Muslims in America. On the same day as Mr. Trump's declaration on Twitter, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo issued a statement declaring that Ms. Muthana "is not a U.S. citizen and will not be admitted into the United States."
But her father filed a lawsuit asking for declarations that she was a citizen and that he may send her money without violating the law, and seeking an order to the government that it take steps to take custody of his daughter and his grandson from the Syrian Democratic Forces and to bring them to American soil.
In dismissing the case, the judge made no ruling about whether it would be lawful for Mr. Muthana to send assistance to his daughter, Ms. Jump said.
In 2014, Ms. Muthana withdrew from college and used her tuition money to pay for travel to Syria. Once there, she promoted ISIS's ideology on social media and called on Muslims in America to carry out terrorist attacks. But since her capture she has apologized and said she wanted to come home, including in an interview with The New York Times.
Another of her lawyers, Charles Swift, has said she had wanted to leave earlier but feared being executed, and noted that the United States government had previously considered her a citizen and issued her a passport.
The State Department canceled her passport in 2016 -- under the Obama administration -- and the Justice Department argued that she did not qualify to be an American citizen under an exception to birthright citizenship in the Constitution for children of foreign diplomats.
Ms. Jump stressed that "the judge today ruled based on his interpretation of when diplomatic immunity ends.
"The court did not base its ruling on a tweet by the president, or by any supposed proclamation made by any official," she continued. "United States citizenship cannot be revoked by tweet or any other form of social media, and today's ruling does not change that."

Thomas L. Friedman: Why I like Mike

Texto completo: I have a pet theory about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict — that it is to wider trends in world affairs what off-Broadway is to Broadway. A lot of stuff seems to get perfected there in miniature — from airline hijackings to suicide bombings, from building walls to keep others out to lone wolf terrorism — and then moves to Broadway, to bigger stages.
So, I ask, what’s playing off Broadway these days? It’s a political drama that may offer a distant mirror on our own presidential politics.
Israel has held two national elections since April, but the country is so perfectly divided that it still hasn’t been able to produce a governing coalition. There are three trends worth noting, though, after these two Israeli elections — especially if you’re President Donald Trump.
First, Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu deployed openly racist tropes against Israeli Arabs to motivate his own hard-right base to get out and vote. Israeli Arabs finally had enough and basically said to Bibi: “You talking to us?” And in the second election in September they voted in huge numbers and created the third-largest party in Israel, weakening Netanyahu’s ability to form a new government. You never know whom you’re arousing when you start using dog whistles. Just sayin’, Mr. Trump.
Second, Bibi was everywhere on television and on social networks — Twitter, Facebook and Israeli websites. In contrast, his main opponent, retired Gen. Benny Gantz, head of the Blue and White party, was quiet, low-key and nowhere nearly as visible. People warned Gantz that Bibi was eating him alive on social media. And what happened?
Thousands of Israelis got sick of the noise — Bibi’s constant tweets and other appearances, hogging and clogging the media landscape — and they switched their votes between the first and second elections, making boring Benny’s party the biggest party in Israel, instead of Bibi’s Likud.
Finally, a good number of left-wing Israelis did not vote for the usual left-wing parties that favor a two-state solution with the Palestinians. They voted instead for Gantz’s centrist party, which offered no peace plan. Why?
They feared that another term of Netanyahu — with his divisiveness and nonstop attacks on the media and key institutions, like the courts and police — would rip apart Israel’s democracy. They feared this more than they did the Palestinians. They wanted someone who not only could beat Bibi but who could also be an antidote to him — someone to heal the country’s divisions before taking on a giant social engineering project like a two-state solution.
Israel and America are very different. But I think there are messages in what’s playing off-Broadway that are worth reflecting on as Democrats choose their presidential candidate
Case in point: I have no idea whether Michael Bloomberg can win the Democratic nomination, but I’m glad that he’s joining the race. (Disclosure: Bloomberg Philanthropies has contributed to Planet Word, the museum my wife is building in Washington, to promote reading and literacy.)
Today “billionaire” has become a dirty word and a disqualifying status for many in the left of the Democratic Party. To me, that is as nonsensical as dismissing Elizabeth Warren as a “communist’’ who wants only to confiscate your money.
Bloomberg is not just some wealthy dude who made his money betting on derivatives on Wall Street and now pops off about the need to cut taxes.
Bloomberg is someone who risked everything he had to start a business that took on giant incumbents and outperformed them and boosted productivity. He is a three-term mayor of New York City, with a record of accomplishments and, yes, controversies — most notably “stop and frisk.” And he is someone who has taken forthright progressive stands on, and put huge funding behind, major public issues — like gun control, gay rights, women’s reproductive rights and climate change.
It was “billionaire” Bloomberg who funded the most radical and progressive green agenda of this era.
“Bloomberg’s Beyond Coal partnership with the Sierra Club broke the mold for environmental philanthropy,” notes Carl Pope, former head of the Sierra Club and now a partner with Bloomberg on Beyond Coal. “In 2010, 500 coal plants provided half of America’s power, at the price of more than 10,000 lives, staggering volumes of water pollution, and one third of total carbon dioxide emissions. The Sierra Club pitched Bloomberg that they could shut down a third of those plants with a three-year campaign, using grassroots community mobilization and aggressive regulatory interventions.”
Attracted by the combination of lives saved and climate impact, Pope added, “Bloomberg ponied up. Now, nine years and several renewals later, coal provides only a quarter of U.S. power, and retirements of more than half those coal plants have been secured. These retirements are largely responsible for U.S. climate progress over the last decade.” The steady fall in the price of gas and renewables was critical in undermining coal, “but Bloomberg’s $500 million for climate mitigation projects was also critical — as was his insistence that the green group, while using its own tool kit, measure its results rigorously.”
There is no question that capitalism is not working for enough people in America today. We cannot sustain a middle class, and the democracy that it upholds, without finding better ways to redistribute the pie. Massive inequality stifles growth.
We need to redivide the pie to better grow the pie. We need to raise taxes to invest in infrastructure and in increasing the capacities of our workforce, starting with universal pre-K, so every citizen has the tools to adapt to the accelerating pace of change.
But growing the pie, and broadening the middle class, also require celebrating and growing entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship — and fostering a culture of accountability, lifelong learning and self-motivation.
I want a Democratic candidate who is ready to promote all these goals, not one who tries to rile up the base by demonizing our most successful entrepreneurs.
Sure, some deserve demonizing, and some don’t. But can we please remember that our growth and good jobs are driven by risk-takers in the private sector starting new companies and creating more taxpayers. Increasingly, the Democratic left sounds hostile to that whole constituency of job-creators. They sound like an anti-business party — in ways that will hurt them with moderate Republicans, independents and suburban women, too many of whom supported Trump in 2016, then shifted to the Democrats and delivered them the House in 2018, and will be vital for defeating Trump in 2020.
So I’m glad Bloomberg may enter the race, because he will forcefully put a Democratic pro-growth, pro-innovation, pro-business agenda on the table, while also pushing ahead on major social issues.
But two other things, at least, are required. The successful Democratic candidate will have to give voice to the anger and angst in the base of the party — where there has been a gutting of the middle class — while channeling that energy in positive, productive ways that also create enthusiasm around the candidate. Not easy. Trump’s base is enthusiastic about him. (It helps when you can say anything — and tell any lie.)
The Democrats also need a candidate who can project strength. When people are stressed and frightened, they want a strong leader. Trump, whom I detest, projects strength.
So yes, Bloomberg is a long shot. He knows that. But I believe his entry into the race — even if it doesn’t propel him to the head of the ticket — will highlight some of these issues that are vital to Democrats’ success and increase the odds that they will produce a presidential candidate with the attributes needed to both get elected and govern effectively.

Report: DeSantis, Parnas had meeting scheduled

Texto completo: Indicted Rudy Giuliani associate Lev Parnas had a meeting scheduled with Gov. Ron DeSantis in January after he was sworn in, Politico reported.
DeSantis spokesman Helen Ferre said the meeting was "political" and put on the calendar by former GOP consultant Susie Wiles, Politico reported, but WIles said she had nothing to do with it. Ferre also told Politico that although a meeting was scheduled, "no substantive meeting occurred."
The report is the latest revelation about DeSantis's connections with the Soviet-born businessman, who himself is now caught up in the Ukraine scandal enveloping Washington.
Parnas and his associate Igor Fruman were arrested in October on charges of funneling foreign cash into U.S. elections.
They donated $50,000 to DeSantis's political committee, which DeSantis ordered to be given to the U.S. Treasury. When first asked about the men, Ferre had said DeSantis had never met "one-on-one" with the two.
But pictures and videos of Parnas and Fruman with DeSantis at his election night celebration party in Orlando soon surfaced, including one where he hugs Fruman. That was soon followed by photos of Parnas with DeSantis at campaign rallies in Boca Raton and South Daytona the weekend before the election.
Ferre later said DeSantis at least never met with Parnas or Fruman while in office as governor. But additional photos showed Parnas and Fruman in a VIP area at DeSantis's inauguration, and on Tuesday came the revelation that a meeting was at least scheduled while DeSantis was in office.
The Washington Post reported Parnas is telling associates he discussed Ukraine at a donor's meeting with President Trump in 2018, in which they suggested the U.S. ambassador to the Ukraine was "unfriendly to the president and his interests."
"Trump immediately suggested that then-Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, who had been in the Foreign Service for 32 years and served under Democratic and Republican presidents, should be fired," the Post reported.
Parnas also reportedly went to the Ukraine to deliver the president's demand of an inquiry into former Vice President Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden, the New York Times reports, the very issue that led to Democrats launching an impeachment inquiry.

Texto completo: Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton refused to close the door on the possibility of entering the 2020 presidential race, telling an interviewer Tuesday that "I never say never to anything."
The 2016 Democratic presidential nominee was asked during a BBC Radio interview if she was "100%" certain she would not run again. Clinton replied that she thinks "all the time about what kind of president I would have been, and what I would have done differently, and what I think it would have meant to our country and the world."
"So of course I think about it. I think about it all the time," she said.
When asked a second time if she was ruling out another run, Clinton again declined to explicitly say she would not do it.
"I will certainly tell you I'm under enormous pressure from many, many, many people to think about it," she said. "But as of this moment, sitting here in this studio talking to you, that is absolutely not in my plans."
If Clinton does plan to enter the fray, time is not on her side, as the filing deadlines have already passed in at least two states, and others are fast approaching. And Clinton said Tuesday that "it's way past time" to get in the race.
Speculation about a 2020 rematch between Clinton and President Donald Trump, the man who defeated her in 2016, has swirled virtually since the moment the election results were announced three years ago.
Though she declared in March that "I'm not running," pundits began to rekindle the idea of a 2020 Clinton campaign after former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's unexpected moves toward a late entry into the race. Former Massachusetts Gov. Duval Patrick is also said to be considering a last-minute run.
Bloomberg is "increasingly concerned that the current field of candidates is not well positioned" to beat Trump, said his adviser Howard Wolfson. The New York Times reported Monday that wealthy Democratic donors have been hoping for fresh faces to enter the race amid concerns about fundraising totals and a lack of confidence in the strength of the leading candidates.
Mark Penn, chief strategist for Clinton's 2008 presidential run, said Bloomberg's move could prod Clinton to consider a run and decide there's "still a political logic there for her."
Former Clinton adviser Philippe Reines said on Fox News last month that "if she thought she had the best odds of beating Donald Trump, I think she would think about it long and hard."
And on Oct.31, former President Bill Clinton dropped the aside that while he is ineligible for another term in the White House, his wife "may or may not run for anything."
In another BBC Radio interview on Tuesday, Hillary Clinton said that "I try to give the best advice I can to the candidates who are running because my goal is to help retire the current incumbent."
Clinton said she did not expect to endorse a candidate in the primary.

Court Rejects Trump Appeal In Battle to Shield Finances

Texto completo: The decision almost certainly paves the way for a major Supreme Court case over President Trump's stonewalling of congressional oversight efforts.
WASHINGTON -- A full federal appeals court on Wednesday let stand an earlier ruling that President Trump's accounting firm must turn over eight years of his financial records to Congress, bringing the case to the threshold of a likely Supreme Court battle.
In the latest of a string of court losses for Mr. Trump over his uncompromising vow to fight "all" subpoenas from Congress, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia rejected his request that it rehear a case in which he challenged the subpoena to the firm, Mazars USA. A panel of the court had sided with lawmakers in that earlier ruling.
The president will now appeal to the Supreme Court, said a lawyer for Mr. Trump, Jay Sekulow. If the justices take the case, as seems likely, it would add another blockbuster case over separation of powers to the court's current term, which ends in June -- in the middle of the presidential election campaign.
"In light of the well-reasoned dissent, we will be seeking review at the Supreme Court," Mr. Sekulow said in a statement.
Lawyers representing Mr. Trump had argued that Congress had no legitimate legislative authority to seek his business records because the panel seeking them, the House Oversight and Reform Committee, was primarily trying to determine whether he broke existing laws -- not weighing whether to enact a new one.
Lawyers for House Democrats rejected that argument, maintaining that it was well within Congress's constitutional authority to seek the records -- both as a matter of oversight and as it considered whether new presidential ethics and financial disclosure laws are necessary.
A three-judge appeals court panel in October rejected that sweeping argument and upheld Congress's authority to issue the subpoena by a 2-to-1 vote. But Mr. Trump petitioned the full court to erase that ruling and reconsider the case. The court on Wednesday rejected his request, 8 to 3.
The case was set in motion before House Democrats announced and then voted to say that they were engaged in an impeachment inquiry, so their constitutional authority to investigate potential presidential misconduct for the purpose of considering whether Mr. Trump should be removed from office has not been part of the legal arguments in the case.
The committee sought the records after Democrats took control of the House in the 2018 midterm election, and after it came to light that Mr. Trump had failed to list on his ethics disclosure forms a debt that he owed and then repaid to his former lawyer and fixer, Michael D. Cohen.
Mr. Cohen had fronted a hush payment to a pornographic actress, Stormy Daniels, just before the 2016 election to induce her to keep quiet about an affair she claimed to have had with Mr. Trump. He has denied the relationship.
Mr. Cohen also testified before Congress that Mr. Trump fraudulently changed the value of his assets for different purposes, like inflating their value on loan applications but deflating them on tax filings. (Mr. Cohen was separately convicted of lying to Congress in earlier testimony.)
The eight judges in the majority included seven appointed by Democratic presidents, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. One, Judge Thomas Griffith, was appointed by President George W. Bush, a Republican.
The three judges who dissented were all appointed by Republican presidents. Two were appointed by Mr. Trump, Gregory Katsas and Neomi Rao, and the third was a judge appointed by President George Bush, Karen L. Henderson. Ms. Rao had been the dissenting vote in the earlier panel decision.
None of the judges in the majority filed a new opinion supplementing the panel's ruling. Judge David S. Tatel had written that the judges on the panel concluded that the subpoena to Mazars is valid because "the public record reveals legitimate legislative pursuits, not an impermissible law enforcement purpose, behind the committee's subpoena."
Judge Katsas, who was Mr. Trump's deputy White House counsel before Mr. Trump appointed him to the court in December 2017, wrote a brief opinion dissenting from the court's decision not to rehear the case, which Judge Henderson joined.
He wrote that if "one committee of one House of Congress" can compel a president to disclose personal records whenever it conceivably could pass legislation regarding the presidency, it would pose a serious "threat to presidential autonomy and independence."
Judge Rao was the head of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs in Mr. Trump's White House before he appointed her to the bench in March. She separately wrote a brief opinion reiterating the thrust of her longer dissent in the panel decision.
Essentially, she said that because Congress was not relying on its impeachment power when it issued the subpoena, its legislative power alone was insufficient to justify the "unprecedented" request.
In her new opinion, she also rejected House Democrats' argument that the question of which kind of legal authority it was invoking was no longer of "practical consequence" because two weeks ago, the full House voted for a resolution endorsing the impeachment investigation, which it styled as "ongoing." She noted that the House had not reissued its subpoena for the financial records since then and argued that the resolution did not affect the legal basis for the committee's earlier demand for Mr. Trump's accounting records.

Facing ‘certain death,’ boy with vaping injury gets double lung transplant

Texto completo: A 17-year-old boy whose lungs were irreversibly damaged by vaping received a double-lung transplant at the Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, a lifesaving measure taken when a patient’s own lungs are diseased or damaged beyond repair and there is no other hope of survival, doctors said Tuesday.
Without the transplant, performed last month, the patient “would have faced certain death,” Dr. Hassan Nemeh, who led the surgical team, said during a news conference at the hospital.
The patient’s lungs were scarred, stiffened, pocked with dead spots and extremely inflamed, he said. On a CT scan before the surgery, the patient’s chest appeared almost empty, as if the lungs had vanished. Normal lungs look dark on imaging because they are full of air; the patient’s lungs were not visible because they were not working. There was no air.
“What I saw in his lungs is like nothing I’ve seen before, and I’ve been doing lung transplants for 20 years,” Nemeh said. He added, “This is an evil I haven’t faced before.”
He called the case a preventable tragedy caused by “a senseless type of product that needs to be fought.”

The patient is recovering well and is up and about now, but still in the hospital. His name is being withheld to protect his privacy, but he and his family wanted to release information about his case in the hope that it might persuade others to quit vaping or never start, hospital officials said.
A doctor at the briefing read a statement from the family, which said, in part: “We asked Henry Ford doctors to share that the horrific life-threatening effects of vaping are very real! Our family could never have imagined being at the center of the largest adolescent public health crisis to face our country in decades.”
Patients with organ transplants need a lifelong regimen of medicines to suppress the immune system to prevent rejection. Dr. Lisa Allenspach, a lung specialist at the Henry Ford Hospital, said that the median survival rate after a lung transplant is seven years, but that rate has been steadily improving.
The patient’s youth and good health before this illness should work in his favor, she said, adding, “We’re hopeful that he will be alive and well for a long time.”
The doctors declined to say what products the patient had been vaping, how long he had been doing it or how often. About 86% of the patients with lung injuries in this outbreak had vaped THC, the chemical in marijuana that makes people high.
The case is the first transplant reported in the nationwide outbreak of vaping-related lung injuries, and it highlights the severity of an illness that, as of Nov. 5, had sickened 2,051 people and killed 40.
“I believe we are just beginning to see the tip of the iceberg,” Allenspach said.
Researchers have described the lung damage from vaping as chemical burns, similar to the injuries in people who have inhaled toxic fumes in industrial accidents, or in soldiers attacked with mustard gas in World War I.
The patients’ surgery was performed on Oct. 15. The doctors said they could not reveal any information about the source except to say that the donor had been healthy.
Health officials investigating the outbreak described a major advance last week: Researchers found a “very strong culprit,” a form of vitamin E, in the lungs of patients who had the vaping illness. The substance, vitamin E acetate, is sometimes used by illicit sellers to “cut” or dilute THC and increase profits.
The vitamin compound is thick and sticky. Precisely how it might damage the lungs is not yet known, and health authorities say it is still possible that other chemicals added to vaping fluids may also contribute to lung disease.
The doctors in Detroit did not say whether the compound had been found in the patient’s lungs.

Texto completo: The 2019 college admissions scandal exposed both parents and college personnel willing to engage in fraud to ensure admission of probably undeserving children to "elite" colleges. In addition, Arizona State University was unfairly scandalized by Mossimo Giannulli (the husband of actor Lori Loughlin) when he wrote in an email that he wanted to make sure that his daughter got "into a school other than ASU!" ASU President Michael Crow responded in a recently published New York Times op-ed aptly titled, "It's time to end the obsession with college exclusivity."
My colleague and I are proud to be faculty members at ASU, a university with a charter that states it should be "measured not by whom it excludes, but rather by whom it includes and how they succeed." Not a bad ideal for parents to consider when helping their children choose a university. But does this aspiration lead to accomplishment?
To help enlighten readers about accomplishment, here is a partial list of amazing students who won various awards in just one ASU department (Psychology) in just one year (2018-2019 academic year):
Libby Villalobos is the Dean's Medalist in Psychology. Each of the 18 science departments in the ASU College of Liberal Arts and Sciences chooses a medalist from among 4,000 students. Villalobos first attracted attention when she applied to be an undergraduate teaching assistant before she was even enrolled at ASU. As a homeless, single mother, she was determined to use education to help overcome poverty. She has maintained an A+ average while working at the Women's Refugee Health Clinic and in two labs. Her goal is to obtain a J.D. and Ph.D. and become an advocate for underserved populations.
Eleanor Rodriguez is the winner of the Phillip Mickelson Award for Excellence in Psychology (PGA champion Mickelson was a psychology major at ASU). At the age of 13, she told her parents she would like to go to college rather than high school. With their support, she applied, was accepted and graduated at age 17 with a bachelor of science degree in education and dance. She has received national recognition in ballet, figure skating and archery. She has now returned to college at ASU as a Barrett Honors student to earn another degree majoring in psychology and minoring in kinesiology.
Elliot Smith is the winner of the Ernest Lindholm Award for Outstanding Senior in Biopsychology. Ms. Smith is a Barrett honors student double majoring in Psychology and Biophysics. She has served as an aide for the ASU Physics mentoring program, an academic facilitator and mentor for the ASU Sundial Program. She's helped to organize and chair multiple student conferences and is co-author of a publication.
Anna Yee is the winner of the John W. Reich Prize in Applied Social Psychology. She is a Barrett Honors student double majoring in psychology and neuroscience. In addition to her lab work, she volunteers at an outreach wellness clinic for the homeless, has been a research assistant at an ASU center for applied ethics, was a Mayo Clinic premed scholar and is a volunteer medical intern in Argentina.
Nicole Richards is one of the winners of the Zita M. Johnson Child Study Scholarship. Richards is diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis. Nonetheless, she is a Barrett Honors student double majoring in psychology and sociology with a minor in studio art. In addition, she works in two labs, serves as an undergraduate representative on the college student affairs and grievances committee. She plans to earn a Ph.D. in developmental psychology and to specialize in parenting of children who experience pain.
Measuring ASU by the success of these students would surely put it among the elites.
Dr. Arthur Glenberg is a professor of psychology and Dr. Lynda Mae a principal lecturer of psychology at Arizona State University.

Hire a doula?

Texto completo: When you're pregnant, joy and anxiety often intertwine.
Unfortunately, fears about something going wrong are not entirely unfounded. New Jersey ranks fifth highest in maternal mortality rates, based on data from 46 states analyzed in a USA TODAY investigation in 2018. That means that out of every 100,000 births in New Jersey, 37 moms die. The United States, which has the highest maternal death rate among developed countries, is one of only three nations – the others are Afghanistan and Sudan – where the maternal mortality rate is rising, according to the Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health, an organization aimed at reducing harm to women in health care.
To address these problems, First Lady Tammy Murphy has established Nurture NJ, an awareness campaign committed to reducing infant and maternal mortality and morbidity and ensuring equitable maternal and infant care among women and children of all races and ethnicities.
"The color of your skin," Tammy Murphy said in a video on the website of the office of the governor, "should not impact the quality of the care you get or your chances of surviving maternity or surviving your first year of birth."
How do you continue to tamp down all those concerns? With education. With assertiveness. With help from people you trust.
And, perhaps, with help from a doula.
What is a doula? A doula's job is to help pregnant women navigate the nine months that lead to motherhood.
A bill that passed in the New Jersey state Assembly in March aims to improve access to doula services by expanding Medicaid coverage, but federal approval is needed before the bill can have any lasting impact.
Doulas provide non-medical assistance to women during pregnancy, childbirth and the post-partum period. Sometimes known as "birth sisters," doulas serve as coaches and all-around helpers to the pregnant woman and her birth partner.
They can perform acupressure and other comfort measures during labor. They give encouragement to a laboring woman and her partner. They are trained professionals who give continuous physical and emotional support, as well as up-to-date, evidence-based research and information.
"We don't take away anything from the doctor," said Angela Turner, a doula with Community Doulas of South Jersey in Camden. "We work with the mothers, in pre-natal care, asking them, 'What plans do you have? What kind of birth do you want?' with the understanding that birth is unpredictable."
Turner recalled the labor experience of a client whose goal was to have a fully natural childbirth. At 41 weeks of pregnancy, however, she agreed to be induced, but, with the backing of Turner as her doula, she was still able to remain in control of the process.
"She requested female doctors and staff. She wanted lights off," Turner said. "She wanted family members in the room, and she wanted to be able to move around. She wanted time to herself for prayer, with nobody in the room."
"Her doctors were on board with what she wanted," Turner said. "They just waited and watched, as her body did what it was supposed to do. And she had a wonderful childbirth experience."
An ancient practice In some cultures, relatives routinely serve as unofficial doulas, with mothers, grandmothers or aunts helping women as they give birth.
"My family is from the Dominican Republic," said Cristina Ramos, a doula based in the Somerset section of Franklin. "My oldest aunt has been attending family births for 50 years, beginning at age 18. She was a lay doula."
Later, after Ramos became a mother, she, too, took up that role for her extended family.
When Ramos learned that a friend was training to become a professional doula through Doulas Of North America (DONA), she said to herself, "That's pretty much what I do," and switched from a career in sales to one as a doula.
Ronsha Dickerson, director of Community Doulas of South Jersey, says the presence of a doula in a hospital's labor and delivery ward serves to validate and empower pregnant women.
"Our goal is that moms feel they have value in that room," Dickerson said.
Hill knows first hand the difference that extra cheerleader can make. She has four daughters, and each birth was different. Hill's mother accompanied her for the first birth, and she credits her mom's company with helping her make it through labor unmedicated.
"For the second one, my mom got caught in traffic," Hill said. "I noticed a difference right away. It was a horrible experience."
Hilll's third and fourth child were born by C section, so she did not labor.
"Doulas provide continuity of care," Ramos said. "It doesn't matter how long it takes, I will be there for the entire birth."
Meeting moms' needs Most importantly, doulas serve as advocates. They make sure that a pregnant woman's needs are met and her wishes are respected.
Ramos said she asks many questions of prospective clients: "What kind of birth do you want?" "What forms of intervention do you want or not want?" And one that may come as a surprise: "Are you confident that your provider is looking out for your best interests?"
Ramos advises clients to shop around for a doctor or midwife, hospital or birthing center, until they find what feels right.
Advocacy can be especially important for women of color.
As reported in June by the USA TODAY Network, the overwhelming majority of women who die or suffer catastrophic injury in birth or post-delivery are African-American women.
Why does this happen? Doulas say the answer is very simple. "People in the medical field," Ramos said, "they just don't listen."
New Jersey Assemblywoman Shavonda Sumter told a reporter for lohud.com that New Jersey Health Commissioner Shereef Elnahal "hit the nail on the head" when he said, "It's implicit bias."
The phenomenon of "weathering," or the toll that is exacted on African-American women's bodies from the grinding stress of systemic racism, was examined in an influential 2018 article in the New York Times Magazine by Linda Villarosa. "Weathering" cuts across class, education and income levels, and lifestyle factors.
Alynson Sloan-Anderson, a doula with Community Doulas of South Jersey, said the support of a doula can mitigate some of that bone-deep stress that African-American women carry.
"It's important because it empowers black and brown women who have traditionally been underrepresented and overlooked," Sloan-Anderson said. "There's a level of trust that needs to be built up, to where they can say, 'I trust you to come into my home,' and we go in with a non-judgmental attitude, and help them use their voices and advocate for themselves to ensure their health and the health of their babies."
"I have always had women of color in my client base," Ramos said, "but I am hearing from more African-American women professionals who are reaching out in fear. I ask them, 'Why do you want a doula?' and they say, 'I am going to die. My cousin almost died. No one listened to her and she was hemorrhaging.' We have to get them to let go of the fear."
"We need an intervention," Hill said, "because doctors aren't listening, not hearing, they're just going by the book. Not everyone's body is the same."
Expanding access to doulas Under the umbrella of Nurture NJ, the state Department of Health's "Healthy Women, Healthy Families" program has provided funding for partners to hire 77 outreach workers – 40 doulas, 29 community health workers and eight community health worker supervisors – to improve the health of African-American women.

Texto completo: Joe Biden is going to win the Democratic nomination for president. I'll be shocked if I'm wrong, and I'll have plenty of company, including many Democrats.
I don't believe Biden is going to win because he's putting together a great campaign or because he has the best ideas. If I were advising the former vice president, I would tell him to take some time off. The nomination is in the bag.
Biden will win because Democrats, in their collective heart of hearts, believe he's the only one who can beat President Donald Trump.
Sure, there will be a few more gaffes on the way to the nomination, and he might think he's in Detroit when he's actually in San Antonio, but that only makes him more kindly and relatable – an absent-minded uncle who pulls a silver dollar out of your ear.
If there is such a thing as a moderate Democrat these days, Biden is it. His positions on various hot-button issues, such as capital punishment and abortion have moved to the left over the years, but he has not endorsed a "Medicare for all" plan that his Democratic challengers are championing. He's supported the "spirit" of the Green New Deal, if not the actual proposal, which left many climate activists wondering where he stands. Biden has a plan, which includes elimination of carbon emissions by 2050.
Erich Pica, president of Friends of the Earth Action, told the Associated Press in June that Biden's commitment to climate change is "somewhat anemic." Well played, Joe. A solid, C-plus, right in the meaty part of the curve.
Biden is playing to the middle, at least compared to other candidates like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass), who has a variety of crazy schemes which include eliminating private health insurance, free college for all, eliminating the Electoral College and a $52 trillion Medicare-for-all plan which, she says will not necessitate raising taxes on the middle class. This, of course, is a lie. There aren't enough rich people in this country to pay for Warren's Golden Corral, all-you-can-eat, entitlement buffet.
The media love Warren but they also loved Hillary Clinton. They're bored with Biden. He's neither inspiring nor offensive. And this is why he's going to win the nomination.
While a recent Monmouth University poll showed Biden and Warren in a virtual dead heat, a Fox News poll of likely Democratic primary voters revealed 68 percent believe that Biden can defeat Trump, compared to 57 for Warren.
But here's some news that should give Democrats the heebiest of jeebies; according to a New York Times/Sienna College survey, Trump trails Biden but leads Warren in the battleground states.
Think about that for a second. Looming impeachment, low approval ratings, unrelenting attacks from a media that can't stand him and still, Trump is competitive in swing states. Considering that the Democrats are involved in a primary and Trump hasn't started campaigning, Democrats should be worried.
If they want to give Trump a gift, they should nominate Warren.

Online Tool Shows Patients Where to Get Abortion Care

Texto completo: After a flurry of anti-abortion legislation, Planned Parenthood built the Abortion Care Finder. It joins other mobile-friendly clinic databases.
As lawmakers across the country began debating and then passing a flurry of anti-abortion measures this past spring, Planned Parenthood took note of a spike in searches on both its website and online for the phrase "abortion near me." There was rampant confusion, the organization said, with women unsure whether the procedure remained legal in their state.
On Tuesday, the organization unveiled an online tool it said would offer clarity to those seeking an abortion. Called the Abortion Care Finder, it shows the nearest available Planned Parenthood abortion providers who are legally able to perform the procedure based on the user's age, ZIP code and last menstrual cycle. Its launch comes just months after some of the most restrictive abortion legislation in the country was passed in states like Alabama, Mississippi and Georgia.
As states passed laws to limit abortion access, Planned Parenthood's clientele became increasingly desperate for information, said its acting president and chief executive, Alexis McGill Johnson. In May, following the passage of the Georgia law, which effectively banned abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, Planned Parenthood Southeast set up an automated phone line to let patients know that abortion in that state remained legal.
"Restrictions have just been coming so fast and furious," Ms. McGill Johnson said.
The Abortion Care Finder shows the nearest Planned Parenthood abortion clinics and explains any relevant state laws and abortion methods, as well as clinic-specific services and financial assistance. It comes on the heels of the organization's interactive abortion access map, which details restrictions across the country.
If the nearest Planned Parenthood is more than 60 miles away, the tool refers users to a map created by the National Abortion Federation that includes independent providers. Though it offers more expansive results and describes abortion laws by state in greater detail, that organization's map does not give customized results based on personal details or exact location.
The Abortion Care Finder's Planned-Parenthood-only results can be misleading in states like Kentucky or Mississippi, where the sole remaining abortion clinics are not run by Planned Parenthood. But since people had searched the Planned Parenthood site for information, "we wanted to make sure that we were connecting them directly to our centers," Ms. McGill Johnson said.
The Abortion Care Finder is not the first tool to offer such guidance. A small, privately funded iPhone app that combines the customization of Abortion Care Finder with the options of the N.A.F. map has been on the market for a few years. The app, Cara, which started the week of the 2016 presidential election, lets the user specify her location and how far along she is. Its purple interface then generates a list of all abortion providers in the area, along with their websites, phone numbers and state-specific legal information.
When they first built Cara, the co-founders Julia Sun and Dr. Celina Crisman split duties: Ms. Sun, a former engineer, worked on tech while Dr. Crisman, a neurosurgeon, vetted providers. The two, who met as college roommates at Cornell, compiled their database by cold-calling more than a thousand purported abortion clinics. One of their main goals in crafting Cara -- partially inspired by episodes of "Law and Order" and "Last Week Tonight With John Oliver" -- was to cut through the slew of evangelical pregnancy centers posing as abortion clinics online.
They said they viewed their work on the app, which they make no money from, as a moral imperative. "We want a world where no one needs to use this," Ms. Sun added. "We think abortion is such a fundamental human right."
The tide of anti-abortion legislation across the country came in the wake of last year's Supreme Court appointment of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, a move that rallied conservatives.
Legislatures in several states passed laws banning abortion after a heartbeat is detected, measures that could effectively prohibit the procedure as early as six weeks into a pregnancy, when many women do not yet know they are pregnant. The laws were all blocked from taking effect by preliminary injunctions issued by federal judges.
A federal judge in Alabama last month temporarily blocked a near-total ban on abortions from going into effect this week, ensuring it remains legal in that state as the law winds its way through the courts.

Filling a Void at the Table in Real Estate Deals

Texto completo: Women are pushing to establish more senior roles for themselves in commercial real estate, an area where they are severely underrepresented.
As a highly successful woman in New York's male-dominated development arena, MaryAnne Gilmartin has a "mini-obsession": She wants to oversee a commercial real estate project in which every part of the process is headed by a woman.
Ms. Gilmartin, the founder of L&L MAG, a real estate development company, knows from experience how to run a real estate project. As the chief executive of Forest City Ratner Companies, she oversaw such prominent projects as the Barclays Center in Brooklyn and the Renzo Piano-designed New York Times building in Manhattan.
Now, she has set her sights on doing the same with an all-women team. Ms. Gilmartin calls it a "she build," and she knows "exactly where to go to find the right woman for every single part of the deal," she said.
Her biggest challenge is securing the capital -- the idea does not get a lot of traction in a room full of male investors, she said. But she is working at it, believing that if she can make such a project happen in New York, it will serve as a beacon to other aspiring developers who are women.
"We outliers have to keep at it," Ms. Gilmartin, 55, said.
That's because, despite progress in many other professional realms, women remain severely underrepresented in real estate development and investment, particularly in senior roles.
Women held just 4 percent of senior investment roles at major real estate firms, according to a widely circulated 2011 study, and their numbers have improved only "marginally" since, said the study's author, Nori Gerardo Lietz, who is a senior lecturer at Harvard Business School and a longtime real estate investor.
Ms. Lietz reviewed the senior ranks of 82 major real estate investment firms for the study, as well as many more private equity and venture capital firms, and found that women were noticeably absent from the most highly paid, "touch the money" jobs.
Her study attributed the gap to a combination of factors, including institutional sexism and more mentoring attention being paid to men than to women.
Eight years later, "the larger firms are trying to open up the funnel and get women in," she said. "But they've not done a good job at retaining them."
Firms should try harder to keep female employees on track, Ms. Lietz said, perhaps with policies for new mothers that allow them to balance the 80-hour workweeks required during transactions with time off.
One of the firms in Ms. Lietz's study was Stockbridge, a real estate investment management firm in San Francisco with nearly $ 15 billion in assets. At the time, women held 17 percent of the firm's senior finance positions. Today, the percentage is closer to 30 across all of Stockbridge's senior positions, including finance, according to Kristin Renaudin, the firm's chief financial officer.
Ms. Renaudin, 42, said she saw a growing number of women involved in real estate investment -- all of the main players working with her on a major real estate portfolio purchase earlier this year were women. But the pipeline of candidates for the deal-making jobs is still heavily male, she said.
"The transactional, investment side is the last to come around," Ms. Renaudin said. That was partly because many women did not pursue those jobs, she said, either because they are put off by a difficult-to-shake stigma that deal-making is a male-oriented culture or, if they have families, because they are discouraged by the significant travel and often-unpredictable work schedule.
Family life is definitely a factor, said Melissa Burch, 43, the executive general manager for New York development at Lendlease, a multinational property and infrastructure firm.
"These roles are all consuming when the deal is hot," she said. "You have to be ready to sprint when the opening is there, and that unpredictability can be unappealing."
Ms. Renaudin said she had been fortunate to have had "no shortage of opportunities" at Stockbridge, but recognized that she was a rarity in the industry. In fact, throughout her 21-year career, she has not had one female mentor or role model, she said.
That lack of role models could also hinder women's rise up the ladder, said Taya Cook, the director of development at Urban Capital, a condominium development firm in Toronto.
"There are women I look up to in the industry, but they haven't acted as mentors or role models," she said. "I'd like to provide that for the younger generation."
Ms. Cook hopes to do that with her own version of a "she build." She and Sherry Larjani, the managing partner at Spotlight Development, also in Toronto, are leading a handpicked, all-women team to develop a 200-unit condominium building called Reina (the Spanish word for queen) in the Etobicoke district of Toronto.
The idea came last year after Ms. Cook, 38, read a Toronto Life magazine article that highlighted the city's leading condo developers. All 20 were men.
"Honestly, it's insane," she said. "When you step back and have a look, it's probably one of the last industries that's really just so unbalanced."
Ms. Cook noted that the backing of Urban Capital, which is run by two men, had eased the path to financing. Without their successful history behind her, "I would expect the experience to be much more difficult," she said. "Finance is definitely on par with construction and development as a boys' club."
The Reina project has garnered considerable publicity in the Toronto area, said Ms. Larjani, also 38. Like Ms. Cook, she hopes the publicity will draw more young women into development.
"The point is to show that these women are working in all these roles, and they are roles you can take on," Ms. Larjani said.
Ms. Gilmartin said that she never felt intimidated or thwarted at the table by men, but that young women coming out of top business schools "looking at a landscape of males" could have trouble seeing a way to break through.
"There are just not enough examples for these women," she said.
Ms. Burch said that women should feel confident that if they can just "get into the room," even if it is filled with men, they will figure out how to use their talents to rise.
She spent the first 13 years of her career at Forest City Ratner, where, she said, she started out as a "human clicker," running the digital portion of presentations that the company co-founder Bruce Ratner made to investors. Just sitting in on dozens of those presentations was instructive.
"I soaked in every one of those conversations," Ms. Burch said. "How do you convince investors? How do you lay forth a vision and bring others along?"
Eventually, she jumped in and made some of those presentations herself, and later worked closely with Ms. Gilmartin. Now, she's hiring women for her own team at Lendlease, including one who's in charge of acquisitions.
"She'd been in development for 10 years and never had a female boss," Ms. Burch said of the woman she hired. "She told me one of the big reasons she came here was to have that. It was important to her."

Texto completo: The cult of personality is an unfortunate trait in Latin American politics. It must end.
SÃO PAULO, Brazil -- The former president of Brazil, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, was released last Friday after a year and a half in prison. Mr. da Silva, who is still facing pending charges, could well find himself back in prison, but for now he will be able to remain free until all his appeals are exhausted. Given the unpopularity of the current president, Jair Bolsonaro, the liberation of the most beloved and hated man in Brazil threatens to further deepen political tension.
The Workers' Party has floundered since Mr. da Silva was imprisoned in April 2018. And yet no other politician has managed to come to the fore while in prison as he has. With his charismatic rhetoric and his track record as one of the most popular presidents in Brazilian history, he remains the only opposition figure capable of mobilizing the masses.
Paradoxically, until now the only opposition Mr. Bolsonaro's presidency has faced has come largely from within his own party. Mr. da Silva and his allies hope to invigorate the Workers' Party -- the country's most important opposition force. Now that he is free, the party can focus its efforts on counterbalancing Mr. Bolsonaro, the extreme-right former congressman elected last year.
Mr. da Silva remained a front-runner in the 2018 presidential election even after he was jailed. When his impending release was announced this past Friday, hundreds of supporters stood outside the federal police building in Curitiba, the capital of Paraná, celebrating. The following day in São Paulo, just as on the day he was imprisoned, thousands of people gathered at the Metalworkers' Union, where Lula began his career as a union leader in the 1970s. "I'm back," he said. "I have more will to fight than when I left here."
Mr. da Silva cannot run for office unless his criminal convictions are overturned. But he will nonetheless make up for lost time by embarking on a tour across the country, re-establishing his place in Brazilian politics. His release will further ignite the polarization that Brazil has experienced over the past five years.
Unable to remain silent, Mr. Bolsonaro took to Twitter after the leftist leader was released, saying: "Don't give ammunition to the scoundrel, who is momentarily free but full of guilt." Mr. da Silva in turn said that the country was governed by the paramilitaries.
Many Brazilians who voted for Mr. Bolsonaro in 2018 are firmly against the Workers' Party, and are staunch supporters of Operation Lava Jato -- the wide-ranging corruption investigation that began in 2014 -- but polls show that a many of them are unhappy with the current situation: Mr. Bolsonaro's 32 percent approval rating is the lowest of any president in his first year since 1987.
Even so, others are angry about Mr. da Silva's newfound freedom. His incarceration was, in large part, a response to the popular dissatisfaction with longtime and systemic impunity. For those, his release has meant losing the battle against corruption.
Now, with a clear enemy walking free, Mr. Bolsonaro can divert attention from successive mistakes -- from his inability to control the fires that recently ravaged large parts of the Amazon to his embarrassing offenses against world leaders -- and retake his anti-corruption rhetoric. His anti-corruption drive, though, has been tainted by revelations of shady dealings within his family and his party.
Latin America is gripped by discontent and unrest, as shown by the protests in Bolivia, Chile and Ecuador. Both the government and its opposition must tread carefully with their belligerent rhetoric. Although it may be naïve to think that both sides will opt for the path of conciliation and unity that Brazil so desperately needs, both Mr. da Silva and Mr. Bolsonaro should make an attempt: it is of utmost importance to start to mitigate the extremism that has corroded democracy in the country and the region.
The fact that Mr. Bolsonaro has met his oppositional match is a good thing. But the cult of personality, which both leaders exemplify, is an unfortunate trait in Latin American politics. It must end.
Mr. da Silva, 74, who has dominated the Brazilian political arena for the last 16 years, has impeded generational replacement within the Brazilian left and center left. It will now be even more difficult to identify new leadership capable of tackling the far-right bombast. What Brazil needs most now is to shake off the cult of personality that has caused a toxic dependence on politics that revolves around the same cast of characters.
Now with Mr. da Silva's release, the ideal of a country that is more united and democratic, and less autocratic, seems farther away than ever.

Texto completo: "We've had 20 years of presidential debates, and we have never talked about the violence in America of child poverty. We have got to begin to talk more eloquently and persuasively and urgently about doing the things not just to make sure fair taxes are paid by people on the top, but that we deal with the moral obscenity of having the highest levels of child poverty in the industrial world."
- Sen. Cory Booker, Oct. 15 Democratic presidential debate
The Children's Defense Fund has been standing with 18-year-old Beat the Odds scholar Israel Glenn in calling for a presidential debate question about child poverty.
It's been 20 years since presidential candidates have been asked in a debate how they would solve this urgent crisis. Glenn started an online petition demanding this question be asked because he doesn't want another generation of children to experience the burdens of hunger, homelessness and instability that he did.
More than 30,000 people and five presidential candidates have joined him, and during the last presidential debate Sen. Cory Booker spoke up to agree. The fact that the United States has one of the highest child poverty rates in the industrialized world is a moral obscenity and a profound threat to America's future. It's time to ask all those running for president and public office at every level what steps they will take to end it.
Booker's plan for "Ending Child Poverty in America and Creating Opportunity for All" would expand the Child Tax Credit; create a "child allowance" for families with children; strengthen the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly known as food stamps); provide universal free school lunch to help eliminate child hunger; reform Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) to help more children and families escape poverty; and tackle child and family homelessness. It also would ensure jobs pay enough to keep families out of poverty and expand affordable child care for working families.
Booker says: "Eliminating poverty isn't just a moral calling; we all lose when not everyone can participate in our economic growth. Our children will be the leaders of the future, and the workforce powering the global economy. A recent report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine found that child poverty costs us as much $1 trillion each year - or 5.4 percent of GDP - driven by higher crime rates, worse health outcomes, and lower earnings among poor kids after becoming adults. Every dollar spent today combating child poverty saves us $7 down the road."
Booker isn't the only candidate seeking to solve this moral and economic crisis. Sen. Kamala Harris' "Children's Agenda" would issue an executive order to end child poverty and establish a federal inter-agency working group to coordinate federal action as part of a plan to cut child poverty 50 percent in her first term. She too would protect and strengthen existing safety net programs, provide middle class and working families a tax credit to address the rising cost of living, and fight to close the pay gap to cut poverty for children with working mothers.
Several other candidates have plans to tackle pieces of the child poverty crisis by raising the minimum wage, making child care more affordable, and more. Many of their proposals are similar to those outlined in CDF's Ending Child Poverty Now report. We are waiting to hear every presidential candidate's plan for ending child poverty.
After the last debate, New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof cheered Booker's mention of child poverty onstage, saying, "Those kids can't vote, so they need us to vote on their behalf. Bravo!" We must continue speaking up for children in this election and putting the issues that impact them front and center. Let's all keep talking about child poverty and demanding urgent action because children only have one childhood and it is right now.
Marian Wright Edelman is the founder and president emerita of the Children's Defense Fund.

Texto completo: NORTH HAVEN — After 34 dedicated years, the Director of Library Services for the Town of North Haven, Patricia LaTerza, is retiring.
LaTerza joined the staff at the North Haven Library as Head of Children's Service in November 1985. She immediately took the department under her wing, and created countless new programs for children including Adventures in Art, Baby Bounce, Sensory Storytime, and a Story Walk along the town green. She was responsible for developing the children's department collection, including an extensive selection of fairy tales and special collections such as “sick kid kits” and “sensory kits.” She added cake pans to the circulating collection in 2010, and the North Haven Library was among the first in the nation to offer them. This was featured in a New York Times article and on NPR.
Her Summer Reading Program for children was enjoyed by over 1,000 children each summer. For many years, she organized and ran a carnival on the library grounds to kick off Summer Reading. In 2014, she worked with more than 50 local businesses to help sponsor the town-wide "One Town, One Book" program, Reading is Your Golden Ticket.
LaTerza became the Assistant Director of Library Services in 2015. In this role, Pat brought her vision to the rest of the library, creating enticing displays that incorporated the bookstore feel. She increased programming for adults, bringing in many new programs on art and history. She was appointed Director of Library Services in 2016. She added more displays, rearranged the second floor to offer more comfortable seating, and created much needed quiet study space. Programming for adults has continued to expand; she implemented a coffee and snack bar with new cafe-style seating and has forged many impactful relationships through the years, working with local groups in the North Haven community. A reception in LaTerza’s honor will be held in the library’s community room Thursday from 3-5:30 p.m. with refreshments. The public is welcome.

‘Fiddler’ revival also updates choreography

Texto completo: “Fiddler on the Roof” is one of the most popular musicals ever written. It’s been revived five times on Broadway since its record-breaking and Tony Award-bedecked 1964 debut, which was directed and choreographed by Jerome Robbins.
But until director Bartlett Sher took on the musical for its 2015 revival no one had displaced Robbins’ choreography.
Sher, whose past revivals include acclaimed productions of “South Pacific” and “The King and I,” gave the job of creating new choreography to Hofesh Shechter, an Israeli-born contemporary dance choreographer who had never done a musical.
“The dances grow out of real situations, so I thought it would be more fun to revisit them,” Sher told The New York Times. As Shechter had “grown up in that universe, I thought the conversation between him and Robbins would be interesting,” he said.
But will audiences attending the production that will open the Kravis Center’s Broadway series season on Tuesday notice the difference?
Christopher Evans, Shechter’s assistant as he
was creating the choreography and its shepherd during the tour, doesn’t think so. But not because Shechter slavishly copied the master.
“The work Hofesh has made is so virtuosic, detailed and woven into the story, I don’t think you’ll have the head space to compare the choreography because you’ll be so plugged into this world,” he said.
Sher told Shechter he had to base his movements on Robbins’ choreography but gave him license to do what he wanted, Shechter said to the Times.
As a youngster, Shechter learned Israeli folk dance. He began his career as a performer with Tel Aviv’s Batsheva Dance Company.
Robbins’ iconic choreography “has the quality of being virtuosic, look-at-this choreography,” whereas Shechter’s choreography is more natural and rooted in community, Evans said.
Shechter was most faithful to Robbins in the famous bottle dance during the wedding scene. “That’s a massive deal,” Evans said. “People are itching for that to be done. When it comes, it really pops.”
In approaching the work, Shechter wanted his choreography to feel “like people dancing, not dancers dancing,” he told broadwayshowbiz.com.
The story, which is set in Russia around 1905, is about the disintegration of a family — that of the show’s star, the milkman Tevye — and the collapse of a community, Tevye’s village Anatevka, which is destroyed when its Jewish inhabitants are driven out.
Shechter’s dances aren’t the only Israeli element in the touring production.
Yehezkel Lazarov, who plays Tevye, is an Israeli who is not only an actor, but also a director and a multidisciplinary artist.
Tevye wasn’t a role he’d dreamed of playing. He’s more of a play than a musical theater actor, although he has performed in some musicals.
Although “Fiddler on the Roof” is embedded in the American Jewish culture, it isn’t as popular in Israel, he said, even though the show is based on the stories of the beloved Yiddish author Sholem Aleichem.
“First, it’s an American production,” he said. “Second, it’s in English.”
It wasn’t until well into the tour that he made the connection between his own heritage and Tevye’s story.
His grandparents fled Russia because of the pogroms.
“All these stories I heard as a kid,” he said. “It was like a legend. And here I am 40 years later playing this man in Russia going through the same thing.”
Something else he shares with Tevye is a love for his daughters. He’s been traveling with his wife and his three daughters since the tour began in October 2018. They just returned to Israel, but will stop by now and then during the tour’s second year.
They’ve seen the show 40 times. Watching him perform in a story that mirrors his grandparents’ is an educational experience for his children, the actor said.
But Sher wanted the revival to be more than a history lesson. He sees parallels between Tevye’s story and today’s refugee crises around the world. That’s why he begins and ends the show with a bare-headed Tevye dressed in a contemporary red parka.
“This is happening now,” Lazarov said. “You can’t make ‘Fiddler’ today and have it be about only the love stories, family and tradition. You have to say tradition and community are beautiful, but they can hurt if you’re not open to other traditions and communities.”
That message hasn’t changed since “Fiddler” first danced onto a Broadway stage 55 years ago.

Paul Krugman: America is not waiting for a billionaire to come to the rescue

Texto completo: Immense wealth isn’t good for your reality sense.
Billionaires aren’t necessarily bad people, and most of them probably aren’t. However, some are, and my unscientific sense is that billionaires are more likely than the rest of us to exhibit bad judgment warped by runaway egos, especially in the political sphere.
It’s not hard to see why: Great wealth attracts people eager to tell an extremely rich man (or woman, but political egotism is mainly a male thing) what he wants to hear. In the political arena this means telling billionaires both that their lavish financial rewards are a mere fraction of the vast contribution they have made to society, and that the public is clamoring for them to take their rightful role as leaders.
Put it this way: These days, many political factions are accused, with varying degrees of justice, of living in some kind of bubble, out of touch with American reality. But few live as thoroughly in a bubble as the billionaire class and its hangers-on.
And now the billionaires in the bubble find themselves in an environment in which concerns about soaring inequality, about the extraordinary concentration of wealth in the hands of the few, finally seem to be getting political traction. And they’re not handling it well.
Obviously I’m going to get to Michael Bloomberg in a minute. First, however, let me talk about the economics and politics of billionaires in general.
So, do billionaires in general make vast contributions to society? To make that case, you don’t just have to argue that they’ve earned their wealth by doing productive things. You have to argue that their wealth is just part of what they’ve added to national income.
And that’s a hard argument to make when you look at how most billionaires have made their money. After all, many of them struck it rich in finance and real estate.
Now, not that long ago the world economy was brought to its knees by the collapse of a huge real estate bubble, which destabilized a financial system that had been drastically weakened by “innovations” that supposedly made us richer — and that certainly enriched some wheeler-dealers — but that had, it turned out, greatly increased the risk of crisis. Do you really want to make the case that financial industry billionaires have been great benefactors?
The next biggest group of billionaires, by the way, made their money in fashion and retailing. Technology comes in only fourth — and as anyone following the news knows, some serious questions exist about the extent to which big fortunes in tech are modern versions of the monopoly spoils grabbed by old-fashioned robber barons.
It’s also worth noting that the U.S. economy used to get along fine without nearly as many billionaires as it has now.
American economic history since World War II falls fairly neatly into two halves: a first era, ending roughly in 1980, during which progressive taxation, strong unions and social norms limited extreme wealth accumulation at the top, and the era of soaring inequality since then. Did the new prosperity of plutocrats “trickle down” to the nation as a whole? Not according to any measure I know. For example, “multifactor productivity,” the standard economic measure of technological progress (don’t ask), has risen only half as much since the 1980 turning point as it did in the previous era.
What about politics? Many people on Wall Street and a significant part of the punditocracy are socially liberal but economically conservative, or at least leaning that way. That is, they are for racial equality and LGBTQ rights but against major tax increases on the wealthy and big expansion in social programs. And that’s a perfectly coherent point of view.
Inside the billionaire bubble, however, people also imagine that it’s a view with broad popular appeal. Well, it isn’t. Most people, including many self-identified Republicans, want to see higher taxes on the rich and increased spending on social programs; however, quite a few people combine these sentiments with racial hostility and social illiberalism, which is why they seem to vote against their own economic interests.
As best we can tell, the constituency for social liberalism plus fiscal conservatism comprises only a few percent of the electorate. When Howard Schultz — remember him? — ran that combination up the flagpole to see if anyone saluted, only about 4% of voters approved. And early indications don’t show Bloomberg doing much better, even though as someone who successfully ran New York he has a much better case to offer.
I’m not saying that the U.S. public is necessarily ready for the likes of Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders. I worry in particular about the politics of Medicare for All, not because of the cost but because proposing the abolition of private insurance could unnerve tens of millions of middle-class voters.
But the idea that America is just waiting for a billionaire businessman to save the day by riding in on a white horse — or, actually, being driven over in a black limo — is just silly. It is, in fact, the kind of thing only a billionaire could believe.

Texto completo: Beloveds, what would the late columnist Molly Ivins do with today's America?
The two-time Pulitzer finalist who died in 2007 was revered - and sometimes reviled - for her often incendiary and howlingly funny jabs at American politics. No political party was immune from her columns, which appeared in nearly 400 newspapers across the country.
Filmmaker Janice Engel has an idea of what Ivins would do in today's America when climate change and health care - issues Ivins screamed about 25 years ago - are still being debated.
She'd raise hell.
The documentary "Raise Hell: The Life and Times of Molly Ivins" is playing Wednesday night at Naro Expanded Cinema in Norfolk. The 93-minute film debuted at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival earlier this year and was the Audience Award Winner at the SXSW Festival in March.
It has played in select cities to glowing reviews.
Engel, the film's director, producer and writer, has spent the last seven years corralling Ivins' copious notes, columns, sold-out speeches, late-night guest appearances and best-selling books to capture the booming presence that was Ivins.
Local audiences might be familiar with some of work of the Los Angeles-based filmmaker. Not only has Engel produced national television programs like "Vanity Fair Confidential," she co-created with Amber Howell the multimedia series "What We Carry" for the United Jewish Federation of Tidewater, which features local Holocaust survivors. That series has been screened locally and internationally.
Engel has a preference for projects with stories of determination and resilience. She got just that with Ivins.
Ivins always stood out, and it wasn't just because she was 6-feet-tall topped with red hair. The journalist was born in 1944 and grew up in Texas, and she described herself as "a left-wing, aging-Bohemian journalist, who never made a shrewd career move, never dressed for success, never got married, and isn't even a lesbian, which at least would be interesting."
Engel did not know much about Ivins until about seven years ago when producer James Egan dragged her to see Kathleen Turner portray Ivins in the one-woman play "Red Hot Patriot."
When she and Egan realized no one had done a film on Ivins, they knew they had to.
"If we didn't know about her," Engel said in a phone interview from California, "who else didn't know about her?"
They pulled in Houston producer Carlisle Vandervoort and the trio put $10,000 on a credit card to start. Engel grew more delighted with Ivins as she learned what drove the columnist's voice.
Mary Tyler "Molly" Ivins was born in California, but the family moved to Texas when she was an infant. Her father was an oil executive. Ivins has said in interviews she honed her debating skills clashing with her conservative Republican father.
Her family lived in a wealthy Houston hub. During high school, she met George W. Bush, who would become the country's 43rd president and a popular target for Ivins.
As a teen, Ivins was active in civil rights protests in Texas. She studied history and journalism in the north before starting a writing career at the Houston Chronicle. She also worked at the Minneapolis Tribune and then became co-editor of The Texas Observer in 1971. That's when she dived into the state's politics and emerged with columns filled with potshots like, "When the state legislature convenes it means that every village is about to lose its idiot."
Of one politician she wrote, "If his IQ slips any lower, we'll have to start to water him twice a day."
The New York Times hired her away in 1976. She wrote for them until 1982; she felt the paper had begun to stifle her voice. Ivins returned to Texas and wrote for the Dallas Times-Herald and the Fort Worth Star-Telegram before becoming an independent journalist in 2001. She also gave speeches to raise money for the American Civil Liberties Union.
Her first book, "Molly Ivins Can't Say That, Can She?" was released in 1991. She eventually wrote or co-authored several, including the 2003 bestseller "Bushwhacked: Life in George W. Bush's America."
In her columns, Ivins wrote primarily about the goings-on in Texas although she tackled national politics. She often told her readers - whom she called 'beloveds' - to "raise hell" when their representatives weren't representing them right.
"She goes after all of them," Engel said in regard to politicians. "She went after stupidity."
The Virginian-Pilot even dropped Ivins' columns in the early 2000s for being too Texas-centric and "anti-Bush tirades."
Ivins often laughed at herself, too, and wrote about her battle with reoccurring breast cancer, of which she was first diagnosed in 1999. She began a 2002 Time magazine column with the line: "Having breast cancer is massive amounts of no fun. First they mutilate you; then they poison you; then they burn you. I have been on blind dates better than that."
The documentary includes interviews with family and friends, fellow journalists like MSNBC's Rachel Maddow and broadcast icon Dan Rather who saw Ivins as being the rancorous voice America needed then and now.
Engel's does, too. Engel sees a political climate that threatens the freedom of the press and that breeds dissension among Americans. Ivins famously wrote once, "Polarizing people is a good way to win an election and a good way to wreck a country."
"Molly was a student of history and knew that people who don't know history are destined to repeat it," Engel said. "That's why people say she's so prescient."

Texto completo: The Glenbard Parent Series: (GPS) Navigating Healthy Families will host an author event with Erika SÃ¡nchez, the New York Times bestselling author of "I Am Not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter," at 7 p.m. Wednesday, Nov. 20, at Glenbard South High School.
Through generations of families, it has been perceived that the ideal Mexican daughter does not go away to college and does not move out of her parents’ house after high school graduation because she shouldn’t abandon her family. Julia is not your ideal Mexican daughter. That was her sister’s role. But when a tragic accident on a busy Chicago street causes her sister’s death, Julia is left behind to reassemble the shattered pieces of her family.
SÃ¡nchez’s book is both heart wrenching and humorous. Julia’s story is an empowering, coming-of-age tale about losing a sister and shattering stereotypes to find herself amid the pressures, anxieties and expectations of growing up as a Mexican-American.
SÃ¡nchez is a contemporary young adult author and 2017 National Book Award finalist. She is a poet, feminist and cheerleader for young women.
Glenbard South students will hear SÃ¡nchez during the day.
Continuing professional development units are available for the evening presentation.

Biden is the safe candidate for Democrats

Resumen: [...]if I were advising the former vice president, I would tell him to take some time off. While a recent Monmouth University poll showed Biden and Elizabeth Warren in a virtual dead heat, a Fox News poll of likely Democratic primary voters revealed 68 percent believe that Biden can defeat Trump, compared to 57 for Warren. [...]the Democratic Party will eventually support whichever candidate starts winning primaries and will jettison the others, much like the crew of the Star Trek Enterprise jettisoned Mr. Spock in Wrath of Khan.

Texto completo: Joe Biden is going to win the Democratic nomination for president. I wouldn’t run to your bookie with this information. My track record is spotty, at best. But I’ll be shocked if I’m wrong and I’ll have plenty of company, including many Democrats. I don’t believe Biden is going to win because he’s putting together a great campaign or because he has the best ideas. In fact, if I were advising the former vice president, I would tell him to take some time off. Don’t do anything or say anything. Just kind of disappear for a while. The nomination is in the bag.
Biden will win because Democrats, in their collective heart of hearts, believe he’s the only one who can beat President Donald Trump. Sure, there will be a few more gaffes on the way to the nomination, and he might think he’s in Detroit when he’s actually in San Antonio, but that only makes him more kindly and relatable — an absent-minded uncle who pulls a silver dollar out of your ear.
If there is such a thing as a moderate Democrat these days, Biden is it. His positions on various hot-button issues, such as capital punishment and abortion have moved to the left over the years, but he has not endorsed a "Medicare for all" plan that his Democratic challengers are championing. He’s supported the "spirit" of the Green New Deal, if not the actual proposal, which left many climate activists wondering where he stands. Biden has a plan of his own, which includes elimination carbon emissions by 2050.
While a recent Monmouth University poll showed Biden and Elizabeth Warren in a virtual dead heat, a Fox News poll of likely Democratic primary voters revealed 68 percent believe that Biden can defeat Trump, compared to 57 for Warren. But here’s some news that should give Democrats the heebiest of jeebies; according to a New York Times/Sienna College survey, Trump trails Biden but leads Warren in the battleground states that will ultimately decide the election. Think about that for a second. Looming impeachment, low approval ratings, unrelenting attacks from a media that can’t stand him and still, Trump is competitive in swing states. Considering that the Democrats are actively involved in a primary and Trump really hasn’t started campaigning yet, Democrats should be worried.
If they want to give Trump a gift, they should nominate Warren.
Biden is, indeed, the safe, establishment candidate. You might argue that so was Hillary Clinton. But she had baggage Biden doesn’t — too many people just didn’t like her. Warren has likability issues as well, along with an extreme agenda. Will moderate, blue-collar, union-member voters in states like Michigan and Wisconsin vote for Warren? For what it’s worth, the Times survey says "no."
Of course, the Democratic Party will eventually support whichever candidate starts winning primaries and will jettison the others, much like the crew of the Star Trek Enterprise jettisoned Mr. Spock in Wrath of Khan. But for Democrats who believe in an alternative to tepid, "middle-class Joe," I leave you with the words of Spock himself: "It is curious how often you humans manage to obtain that which you do not want."

Texto completo: Joe Biden is going to win the Democratic nomination for president. I wouldn’t run to your bookie with this information. My track record is spotty, at best. But I’ll be shocked if I’m wrong and I’ll have plenty of company, including many Democrats. I don’t believe Biden is going to win because he’s putting together a great campaign or because he has the best ideas. In fact, if I were advising the former vice president, I would tell him to take some time off. Don’t do anything or say anything. Just kind of disappear for a while. The nomination is in the bag.
Biden will win because Democrats, in their collective heart of hearts, believe he’s the only one who can beat President Donald Trump. Sure, there will be a few more gaffes on the way to the nomination, and he might think he’s in Detroit when he’s actually in San Antonio, but that only makes him more kindly and relatable — an absent-minded uncle who pulls a silver dollar out of your ear.
If there is such a thing as a moderate Democrat these days, Biden is it. His positions on various hot-button issues, such as capital punishment and abortion have moved to the left over the years, but he has not endorsed a "Medicare for all" plan that his Democratic challengers are championing. He’s supported the "spirit" of the Green New Deal, if not the actual proposal, which left many climate activists wondering where he stands. Biden has a plan of his own, which includes elimination carbon emissions by 2050.
While a recent Monmouth University poll showed Biden and Elizabeth Warren in a virtual dead heat, a Fox News poll of likely Democratic primary voters revealed 68 percent believe that Biden can defeat Trump, compared to 57 for Warren. But here’s some news that should give Democrats the heebiest of jeebies; according to a New York Times/Sienna College survey, Trump trails Biden but leads Warren in the battleground states that will ultimately decide the election. Think about that for a second. Looming impeachment, low approval ratings, unrelenting attacks from a media that can’t stand him and still, Trump is competitive in swing states. Considering that the Democrats are actively involved in a primary and Trump really hasn’t started campaigning yet, Democrats should be worried.
If they want to give Trump a gift, they should nominate Warren.
Biden is, indeed, the safe, establishment candidate. You might argue that so was Hillary Clinton. But she had baggage Biden doesn’t — too many people just didn’t like her. Warren has likability issues as well, along with an extreme agenda. Will moderate, blue-collar, union-member voters in states like Michigan and Wisconsin vote for Warren? For what it’s worth, the Times survey says "no."
Of course, the Democratic Party will eventually support whichever candidate starts winning primaries and will jettison the others, much like the crew of the Star Trek Enterprise jettisoned Mr. Spock in Wrath of Khan. But for Democrats who believe in an alternative to tepid, "middle-class Joe," I leave you with the words of Spock himself: "It is curious how often you humans manage to obtain that which you do not want."

Texto completo: London — We humans make a lonely crowd, and it’s killing us.
Social isolation is more lethal than smoking 15 cigarettes a day, or than obesity, according to research published by Julianne Holt-Lunstad of Brigham Young University. Since obesity is associated in the United States with 300,000 to 600,000 deaths a year, the implication is that loneliness is a huge, if silent, killer.
Loneliness increases inflammation, heart disease, dementia and death rates, researchers say — but it also simply makes us heartsick and leaves us inhabiting an Edvard Munch canvas. Public health experts in many countries are debating how to address a “loneliness epidemic” that corrodes modern life, but Britain has taken the lead: Last year it appointed a minister for loneliness.
“It touches almost every one of us at some point,” Baroness Barran, the current minister for loneliness, told me. “It can lead to very serious health consequences for the individual and leads to erosion of our society, where people become isolated and disconnected.”
I’ve become interested in loneliness while reporting on the opioid epidemic and soaring suicide rates in the United States. These have complicated roots, partly economic, but they also result from social isolation. Extended families have dissolved, and social institutions like churches, bowling leagues and neighborhood clubs have frayed. We are no longer so deeply embedded in our communities.
“I trained in internal medicine, and I expected most of my time would be spent on diabetes or heart disease or cancer,” Dr. Vivek Murthy, who was surgeon general of the United States under President Barack Obama, told me. “What I didn’t expect was that so many people I saw would be struggling with loneliness.”
More than one-fifth of adults in both the United States and Britain said in a 2018 survey that they often or always feel lonely. More than half of American adults are unmarried, and researchers have found that even among those who are married, 30% of relationships are severely strained. A quarter of Americans now live alone, and as the song says, one is the loneliest number.
One gauge of social isolation, or perhaps selfishness: Murthy says he saw families sometimes drop elderly family members off at a hospital for Thanksgiving or another long weekend in what sounds to me rather like the practice of a family leaving a dog at a kennel when they’re going away. At the hospital, doctors are sometimes the only ones to witness a patient’s death, with no loved ones around.
Loneliness affects physical health in two ways. First, it produces stress hormones that can lead to inflammation and other health problems. Second, people who are alone are less likely to go to doctor appointments, to take medicine or to exercise and eat a healthy diet. We may resent nagging from loved ones, but it can keep us alive.
When I met Barran I suspected that the minister of loneliness portfolio was a bit of a gimmick. In fact, I’m now persuaded that it’s a model for other countries.
The ministry started a “Let’s Talk Loneliness” campaign that sparked difficult conversations across Britain, and it is handing out small grants to local gardening clubs, bird-watching groups and others so that they can spread the word and invite more people to join. One grant of $640, for example, went to a Birmingham group to buy board games and start a game club.
It is supporting “friendly benches,” which are public benches where people are encouraged to go and chat with one another. It’s pushing to keep community spaces open and to stop public transportation from being cut in ways that leave people isolated. The government is also putting social workers in doctor’s offices for “social prescribing” — connecting lonely patients with local organizations.
One early lesson, Barran said: Because of stigma, don’t post a sign inviting lonely people to show up. Rather, have an upbeat sign inviting people to take part in a dog-walking club, a community garden or some other activity.
“We should focus on people’s gifts rather than people’s problems, because most of us would prefer to talk about our gifts,” Barran said.
I suggest that we also make it easier for people to have dogs. There is some evidence that dog owners (but not cat owners) are less lonely, although in fairness the research is mixed.
Some think that the internet has aggravated the problem, because a cursory look through Facebook or Instagram suggests that everyone else in the world is having a fabulous time and enjoys perfect relationships.
Meanwhile, the reasons to address the topic are compelling. “If we could tackle loneliness,” Barran said, “people would feel stronger, more resilient, more optimistic about the future.” Holt-Lunstad has found that greater social connection is associated with a 50% reduced risk of early death.
Australia, Canada, Germany and New Zealand have shown interest in adopting British approaches. Maybe the United States, too, should experiment: How about a new post in the Department of Health and Human Services — an assistant secretary for loneliness?

Opportunity zones slowly seeing support in state

Texto completo: FARGO - Opportunity zones, created to spur investment in economically distressed areas by offering tax incentives to investors, are just beginning to show signs of altering the development landscape in North Dakota.
So far, state securities officials have received notices from three qualified opportunity funds, including Kilbourne Group's Great Plains Opportunity Zone Fund and the Arthur Ventures 2017 Opportunity Fund, both based in Fargo.
Nationally, according to Opportunity DB, which compiles opportunity investment zone funds, there are 117 opportunity funds with an investment capacity of $37.4 billion.
With bipartisan support, the opportunity zone program was enacted as part of President Donald Trump's tax cuts at the end of 2017. Now, after a New York Times investigation, Democratic lawmakers are criticizing the program, arguing that instead of benefiting low-income communities by spurring investment in housing, as well as businesses and the jobs that go with them, they benefit the wealthy.
Kilbourne Group, which is focused on real estate development in downtown Fargo, is using the opportunity zone incentives as one of its financing tools in three projects that together will add 320 to 340 apartment units to the downtown district and require about $59 million of total investment.
They include the Mercantile building, a mixed-use building planned for the location of the former Schumacher Goodyear on Broadway. Pile driving is slated to begin next month.
Next spring, Kilbourne Group, owned by North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, plans to start construction on two other mixed-use buildings, combining commercial and residential spaces.
One is the site of the former Nestor bar, 1001 NP Ave., that would involve two four-story buildings with 147 apartment units. The other is at 1017 4th Ave. N.
"Downtown Fargo is the only place that we are working on projects in opportunity zones," said Mike Allmendinger, Kilbourne Group president. Kilbourne is still seeking investors for the projects.
All three projects are located within official opportunity zones, 25 of which have been designated in North Dakota.
Under the opportunity zone program, touted as an economic development tool, investors can receive tax breaks, including discounts or deferments to entice investment in areas that otherwise would not likely attract financing.
James Leiman, North Dakota's director of economic development and finance, said rules and regulations are still being written for the opportunity zone program, which might explain why projects so far appear to be limited.
"There seems to be a lot of excitement around this and the potential to revitalize communities," he said, adding that projects are largely invisible until they start actively seeking investors and must notify regulators.
"Until someone files, you really don't know," Leiman said. "You're just starting to see movement. We're at the infancy of this."
Earlier this year, the Greater Fargo Moorhead Economic Development Corp. hosted two information seminars for prospective opportunity zone investors and developers.
Kilbourne Group was part of the presentations, said Ryan Aasheim, the EDC's chief business development officer.
"Other than that, it's not been a lot of outward activity," he said. "Kilbourne Group with the Great Plains Opportunity Fund is probably the most active player in the state. I'm not aware of any other funds that have formed or have investments. That doesn't mean they're not happening."
Brian Ritter, president of the Bismarck-Mandan Chamber Economic Development Corp., said his office held an informational seminar on opportunity zone investments, but has heard very little since. He is unaware of any funds or projects in development in Bismarck-Mandan under the program.
Karen Tyler, North Dakota securities commissioner, said rules and regulations for the program should be finished by the end of the year. Also, she added, investors seeking the most benefit under the opportunity zone project have an incentive to make their investments by the end of the year.
"I don't think we have a good sense yet of how much activity is out there," she said. "We could see activity pick up" by the end of the year, Tyler added.
The opportunity zone incentives "certainly have the potential" to help low-income communities that lack investment to spur economic growth, Leiman said.
"This has serious potential to do great things here," he said. "I'm hoping North Dakota can be more or less the case study for rural America."
John Strand, a Fargo city commissioner who often advocates for more affordable housing when projects seeking incentives come before city leaders, said the opportunity zone projects in development in Fargo will help revitalize areas of downtown.
The former Nestor and Goodyear sites, he said, have become rundown parking areas.
"They'll be dramatically improved from what they are now," he said. The Kilbourne projects combine residential and commercial uses with parking that serve people who want to live in or near downtown, he said.
"It's really good stuff."
The opportunity zone program does not require affordable housing, nor is affordable housing required under city incentive programs, something Strand hopes will evolve in the future.

Texto completo: America must lead the way on climate change
Seemingly every day for the past 30 months on the national news, there have been stories of extreme weather. I recall when extreme weather coverage occurred only occasionally because prolonged extreme weather was unusual.
The Trump administration has effectively started the process to remove the U.S. from major worldwide agreements and initiatives, one of the most important of which is what Trump will never utter: "make the environment great again." The United States' removal from the Paris Climate Agreement, which included most of the world's other nations, will cost Trump reelection. Even if other nations dragged their feet, the U.S. must lead.
Just because the rest of the people on Earth are not doing what needs to be done to save the environment for future generations is no legitimate reason why we should not. I recycle, conserve water etc., because it is the right thing to do even if I were the only one to do the right thing.
Climate-change deniers are becoming fewer; voters know how important a healthy environment is to sustaining life on Earth even if Trump has no clue. Lead, America, lead! To do less is a repudiation of our role and duty to the planet.

Restricting news access has precedent
Thank you, Scott Maxwell, for reporting the recent actions of the Citrus County Commissioners, enabling me to understand history in a new light ("Florida officials call New York Times fake," Nov. 7).
The commissioners parroted our president who, according to White House staffers, depends exclusively upon reports from Fox News. If Trump doesn't read any newspapers, how can he assess their coverage of current events?
The New York Times is widely acknowledged as the journal of record for United States, whether it's online or in print. The Commission's refusal to allow the Citrus County Public Library to distribute the online version harks back to certain watershed events.
In Renaissance Italy, the Dominican monk Savanarola conducted a huge "bonfire of the vanities." Hitler Youth were encouraged to burn books written by Jews or by anyone who disagreed with der Führer. Mao Tse Tung ordered the destruction of books that contradicted The Sayings of Mao. In 2012, Al-Qaida Islamists burned books in Mali and Timbuktu.
The commissioners in Citrus County fail to compare to the influence of their predecessors, but the principle is the same. To deny a person access to any reading resource is to deny their right to decide.

Churchill teaches lessons, even today
Winston Churchill: "Some men abandon their party for the sake of their principles. Others, their principles for the sake of their party." Examples abound, mainly for the second section. This is why Trump will survive the impeachment trial, but lose at the ballot box.

Texto completo: Daisy Haggard's dark comedy about second chances hits Showtime, and "Rick & Morty" returns after a two-year hiatus.
What's on TV
BACK TO LIFE 10 p.m. on Showtime. When Miri Matteson (Daisy Haggard) re-emerges in her isolated seaside hometown after spending 18 years in prison for a violent crime, it's her secretive past, and that of those around her, that come to the fore. Across the new show's six episodes, it becomes clear that "the people she's closest to, including her mother, Caroline (Geraldine James), her former best friend, Mandy (Christine Bottomley), and the affable new neighbor, Billy (Adeel Akhtar), are harboring secrets that start to make her own past transgression look tolerable," Mike Hale writes in his New York Times review. This series, which Haggard created and helped write, has already drawn comparisons to "Fleabag" -- another female-led British show that shares the executive producers Harry and Jack Williams and has a similar focus on dark humor, grief and redemption.
DUBLIN MURDERS 8 p.m. on Starz. Like the latest season of "True Detective," this procedural experiments with multiple timelines to examine how a past crime may have influenced a murder in the present. Sarah Greene stars as the Dublin police detective Cassie Maddox, and Killian Scott plays her partner, Detective Rob Reilly, a charismatic investigator who's reinvented himself after a traumatic childhood. But Reilly's shadowy past resurfaces when a young girl is found dead at an archaeological site near Knocknaree -- the same town from which three children went missing 21 years earlier.
RICK AND MORTY 11:30 p.m. on Adult Swim. At the end of this animated show's third season, a character addresses one of the more tortuous aspects of being a fan of the series: "See you for Season 4 in, like, a really long time." Now, after a two-year wait, Rick Sanchez, the self-centered mad scientist, and his grandson, Morty Smith, are finally back for a round of new adventures through the multiverse. Apart from the imaginative science fiction-inspired characters that Rick and Morty come across while traipsing through time and space (including evil variations of themselves), the show has become a popular mainstay with younger audiences thanks in part to its existential humor, nihilistic themes and pop-culture references. The new season contains only five short episodes, but they represent the first of the 70 new episodes Adult Swim ordered last year -- keeping the series creators, Dan Harmon and Justin Roiland, seemingly employed for a very long time and the show's rabid fan base satisfied. Wubba lubba dub dub!
What's Streaming
THE GREAT BRITISH BAKING SHOW: HOLIDAYS Stream on Netflix. This delightful baking competition may have just crowned its Season 10 winner, but it's not the last fans will see of Paul Hollywood, Prue Leith, Noel Fielding and Sandi Toksvig this year. In this special holiday competition, the show's second, bakers from past seasons return to the tent with hopes of impressing the judges with their signature yuletide treats -- and viewers will more than likely get to see some truly festive Christmas sweaters (or jumpers) from Fielding.

Texto completo: Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook says he'll run political ads even if they are false. Jack Dorsey of Twitter says he'll stop running political ads altogether.
Dorsey has the correct approach, but the debate skirts the bigger question: Who is responsible for protecting democracy from big, dangerous lies?
Donald Trump lies like most people breathe. As he's been cornered, his lies have grown more vicious and dangerous. He conjures up conspiracies, spews hate and says established facts are lies and lies are truths.
This would be hard enough for a democracy to handle without Facebook sending Trump's unfiltered lies to the 45% of Americans, for whom it is a source of news. Twitter sends them to 68 million users every day.
A major characteristic of the internet goes by the fancy term "disintermediation." Put simply, it means sellers are linked directly to customers with no need for middlemen.
Amazon eliminates the need for retailers. Online investing eliminates the need for stockbrokers. Travel agents and real estate brokers are obsolete. At a keystroke, consumers get all the information they need.
But democracy can't be disintermediated. We're not just buyers and sellers. We're citizens who need to know what's happening around us in order to exercise our right to self-government, and our responsibility for it.
If a president and his enablers are peddling vicious and dangerous lies, we need reliable intermediaries that help us see them.
Intermediating between the powerful and the people was once mainly the job of publishers and journalists -- hence the term "media." This role was understood to be so critical to democracy that the constitution enshrined it in the First Amendment, guaranteeing freedom of the press.
With that freedom came public responsibility to be a bulwark against powerful lies. The media haven't always lived up to it. We had yellow journalism in the 19th century and today endure shock radio, the National Enquirer and Fox News.
But most publishers and journalists have recognized that duty. Think of the Pentagon Papers, Watergate and, just weeks ago, the exposure of Trump withholding $400 million in security aid to Ukraine until it investigated his major political rival, Joe Biden.
Zuckerberg and Dorsey insist they aren't publishers or journalists. They say Facebook and Twitter are just "platforms" that convey everything and anything -- facts, lies, conspiracies, vendettas -- with none of the public responsibilities that come with being part of the press.
Rubbish. They can't be the major carriers of the news on which most Americans rely while taking no responsibility for its content.
Advertising isn't the issue. It doesn't matter whether Trump pays Facebook or Twitter to post dishonest ads about Biden and his son, or Trump and his enablers post the same lies on Facebook and Twitter. Or even if Russia and Iran repeat the lies in their own subversive posts.
The problem is that we have a president who will say anything to preserve his power, and two giant entities that spread his lies uncritically, like global-sized bullhorns.
We can't do anything about Trump until Election Day or until he's convicted of an impeachable offense. But we can and should take action against the power of these two super-enablers. If they're unwilling to protect the public against powerful lies, they shouldn't have as much power to spread them.
The reason 45% of Americans rely on Facebook for news and Trump's tweets reach 68 million is because these platforms are near monopolies, dominating the information marketplace. No TV network, cable giant or newspaper even comes close. Fox News' viewership rarely exceeds 3 million. The New York Times has 4.7 million subscribers.
Facebook and Twitter aren't just participants in the information marketplace. They're quickly BECOMING the information marketplace.
Antitrust law was designed to check the power of giant commercial entities. Its purpose wasn't just to hold down consumer prices but also to protect democracy. Antitrust should be used against Facebook and Twitter. They should be broken up.
So instead of two mammoth megaphones trumpeting Trump's lies, or those of any similarly truth-challenged successor, the public will have more diverse sources of information, some of which will expose the lies.
Of course, a diverse information marketplace is no guarantee against tyranny. But we now have a president who lies through his teeth and two giant uncritical conveyors of those lies. It is a system that invites tyranny.

Rich Lowry: ‘Nationalism’ shouldn’t be a dirty word

Texto completo: If there is one thing that elite opinion tends to agree about on the left and the right, it is that nationalism is a very bad thing. If anything, this view has become even more entrenched as nationalism has demonstrated its potency in recent years, from the election of Donald Trump to Britain’s vote to leave the European Union.
<img class="size-medium wp-image-2599038" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/Rich-Lowry-Color-300x293.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="293" />
When President Trump first openly embraced the term “nationalist” at a 2018 campaign rally, commentators reacted in horror. Patriotism is about love, nationalism about hate, New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof opined. Trump, insisted Jennifer Rubin of The Washington Post, is “normalizing a hateful political philosophy that is contrary to our deepest-held beliefs.”
As I write in my new book, “The Case for Nationalism,” this reflexive hostility to the concept is ill-informed and an attempt to deem nationalism a swearword and end all discussion on that basis.
At its most basic, the scholar Azar Gat writes, nationalism is “the doctrine and ideology that a people is bound together in solidarity, fate, and common political aspirations.” Historian Anthony Smith described the national ideal as “a belief that all those who shared a common history and culture should be autonomous, united and distinct in their recognized homelands.”
A key contention of nationalism is that a nation has its rights and claims. This is a thread that runs through the Declaration of Independence, the Gettysburg Address and the Atlantic Charter. A nation has the right to break off from larger sovereignties in the cause of self-determination (see, for instance, 1776), and to remake its regime or foundational governing rules (see, for instance, 1789).
So if a nation’s rights and interests are being trampled, loyalty to the nation, i.e., nationalism, may require treason against the government, the object of patriotic loyalty. As Michael Lind explains, “Governments should serve nations, not nations governments.”
When Europe went off the rails in the early 20th century, nationalism as such didn’t cause its crash so much as social Darwinism, militarism and the cult of charismatic leadership. The aftermath of World War I added its own poison.
Regardless, American nationalism — which encompasses such diverse, rightly beloved figures as Alexander Hamilton, Abraham Lincoln and Teddy Roosevelt — is not to be feared. As with so many other things about this country, it is more benign than the versions to be found in Europe and other places around the world.
This is true for a number of reasons. First, we are the inheritors of an Anglo-American tradition that has profound respect for the individual and the rule of law and is a fundamental part of our national identity.
The sheet anchor of American sovereignty, the U.S. Constitution, makes it clear that authority ultimately resides with “we the people of the United States.” The Constitution also happens to be a durable mechanism of self-government and itself an object of patriotic loyalty and national pride.
Finally, the United States was never infected with the dream of universal empire that Europe inherited from Rome and that has lingered on in differing forms from Charlemagne to the European Union.
The rise of Donald Trump has pushed the left further away from respect for nationalistic attitudes and even patriotic symbols. Democrats — and the country — would be much better served if they countered Trump’s nationalism with a version of their own.
On his own side of the aisle, Trump has made Republicans more nationalistic. Still, much of the party is quietly uncomfortable with this. If Trump loses in 2020, the party’s establishment may try to snap back to its pre-Trump disposition of relative indifference to nationalism.
Yet, if there’s one clear political lesson from the long history of nationalism in this country and elsewhere, it is that a party interested in moving people and selling a program should make some sort of an appeal to it — even if conventional wisdom insists it is foolish and wrong.

A Recession Alarm Bell Stops Ringing. That Doesn't Mean There's No Fire.

Texto completo: Investors are feeling better about the economy, but the yield curve has already predicted a recession.
The message from Wall Street is clear: The American economy is not in the kind of trouble that investors feared earlier this year.
Stocks are at all-time highs and climbing. Yields on long-term government bonds, which reflect expectations for growth and inflation, are also rising. Corporate bond spreads show that investors are more confident in the prospects for businesses.
Then there's the yield curve, an indicator from the bond market that just a few months ago set off alarms about the risk of a recession. It has gone back to normal, and that signal has been met with relief in the markets.
But as far as the economy is concerned, it might not matter. Once the yield curve has predicted a recession, one usually follows even if that signal changes later.
To understand why, it's important to remember what the fuss over the yield curve was about in the first place.
Remind me: What is the yield curve?
The yield curve measures the difference between interest rates on short-term government bonds and long-term government bonds (like three-month Treasury bills and 10-year Treasury notes).
Usually, long-term interest rates are higher because, like any borrower, the government ought to be paying more to borrow for 10 years than for three months. But every once in a while, things get flipped around in the bond market and short-term interest rates rise above the long term, in a sign that investors expect slower economic growth or interest rate cuts -- or both.
When it does, the yield curve becomes what economists call "inverted." It happened this year, starting in March, and it got attention because an inverted yield curve is considered one of the financial world's most reliable predictors of a recession.
In fact, each recession of the last 60 years was preceded by a yield curve inversion.
So the return to normal, what's referred to as a "steep" yield curve, is being taken as a good sign.
"A steep curve is a signal that people think that the future is bright, and that is very important to investors," said Jonathan Golub, chief United States equity strategist at Credit Suisse Securities. "This was an incredibly important thing for us to see."
What's with the change in outlook?
It's important to note that the mood in financial markets can change overnight, and that all these feel-good signals could evaporate if investors are confronted with evidence that they're wrong.
The recent optimism overlooks the fact that economists continue to see the global economy, including in the United States, decelerating as trade slows and manufacturing contracts.
But there are some reasons investors are right to relax a little, after months of anticipating the damage of the trade war on the United States economy: The job market is holding up, corporate profit reports have been better than expected, and the hope is that the Federal Reserve's decision to cut interest rates three times so far this year will help keep things going.
Lately, officials in Beijing and Washington have telegraphed that they're making progress in de-escalating the trade war. On Friday, yields on the 10-year Treasury note rose to their highest level since July, and the S&P 500 closed at a new high.
So was the recession signal from the yield curve wrong?
Those who have studied the yield curve and its relationship to the economy stress that, historically speaking, it doesn't matter if the yield curve returns to normal. The recession predictor is that it inverted at all -- though the downturn can take as long as two years to arrive.
"In a way, the damage is done," said Campbell Harvey, a Duke University finance professor whose research first showed the predictive power of the yield curve in the mid-1980s. "If you look at the track record, if you've got an inversion, there is a recession that follows."
One reason is that the yield curve has a real-world impact on the banking system. Banks borrow money at short-term rates and then lend it out -- in a 30-year home mortgage, for example -- at long-term rates.
So when short-term rates are higher than long-term rates, bank profits are crushed and they cut back on lending. That's bad news for the economy.
Then there's the market's feedback loop, which can stymie decision-making by executives, discouraging new investments.
"When the yield curve is inverted, investors pull in risk taking," Mr. Golub of Credit Suisse said.
Mr. Harvey stressed, however, that history didn't always repeat precisely.
And this time, something is slightly different. Since the yield curve inverted, the Fed's three rate cuts have largely been seen as effective ways to keep the economic expansion rolling.
The first of those, in July, came just a few months after the yield curve first inverted.
That's a marked difference from the last time the yield curve inverted, in 2006. Then it was roughly a full year before the Fed began to lower short-term rates. (The last recession began in December 2007.)
"In the face of the inversion, it did nothing," Mr. Harvey said, referring to the Fed. "This inversion, they actually did cut."

Texto completo: The university said the family of Wiseman, a favorite to be the top pick in the N.B.A. draft next summer, took money to move to Memphis when the player was in high school. A judge quickly ruled that Wiseman could play Friday night.
James Wiseman, a top basketball prospect expected to star for the University of Memphis this season, filed a lawsuit against the N.C.A.A. and the university on Friday after the sport's governing body declared him ineligible to play. A judge quickly issued a temporary restraining order that cleared Wiseman to play for Memphis on Friday night.
The Memphis athletic department said in a statement that the family of Wiseman had accepted $ 11,500 in moving expenses from Penny Hardaway, a former Memphis and N.B.A. star who is now the university's coach. The family moved to Memphis from Nashville in 2017, when Wiseman was a high school player. The university said Wiseman did not know about the payment, which would be prohibited by N.C.A.A. rules.
The payment came when Hardaway was coaching at Memphis East High School, where Wiseman finished his high school career. Hardaway became the University of Memphis coach in 2018.
The judge's order, announced by the university, came hours before Memphis was scheduled to play the University of Illinois-Chicago on Friday night. Wiseman started at center and had 17 points, 9 rebounds and 5 blocked shots in a 92-46 Memphis victory.
Wiseman's lawsuit, filed in Shelby County Chancery Court, listed the N.C.A.A., Memphis and others as defendants. Wiseman's attorney, Leslie Ballin, did not respond to messages from The New York Times seeking comment.
The N.C.A.A. issued a statement on Friday night that said: "The University of Memphis was notified that James Wiseman is likely ineligible. The university chose to play him and ultimately is responsible for ensuring its student-athletes are eligible to play."
University officials said they were working with the N.C.A.A.'s staff to restore Wiseman's playing status.
"Particularly given the unique circumstances in this case, we are hopeful for a fair and equitable resolution on James's eligibility," said M. David Rudd, the university's president. "We support James's right to challenge the N.C.A.A. ruling on this matter."
Memphis, ranked No. 14 in the preseason Associated Press Top 25, has the top class of freshmen in the country, led by the 7-foot-1 Wiseman, who is considered a leading candidate to be the top pick in the N.B.A. draft next summer.
Wiseman and Hardaway have known each other for several years, through youth and high school leagues. After Wiseman transferred to Memphis East High School to play for Hardaway, the team won a state title in 2018.
After Friday's game, Hardaway declined to take questions about the N.C.A.A. and the legal issues. The coach also made clear that Wiseman would continue to play, at least until a Nov. 18 hearing, and that he liked how the freshman had handled a roller-coaster day.
"I'm sure he was a little nervous, but he went out there and played his heart out, had five blocks in the first half," Hardaway said. "To me, he was still business as usual."
Wiseman's eligibility trouble emerged the same day Ohio State announced that another top college athlete, the football player Chase Young, would not play on Saturday against Maryland as university officials investigated a "possible N.C.A.A. issue from 2018." Young said on Twitter that questions had been raised over a loan he took from a family friend and repaid.
More broadly, the N.C.A.A. is facing pressure, including from lawmakers in California, to overhaul a system in which college athletes cannot be paid beyond the costs of attendance. California passed a law in September to allow athletes to sign individual sponsorship deals and make money from their fame, and the N.C.A.A. last month said it would consider allowing athletes to profit in limited ways.

Texto completo: Readers discuss polling data that indicates the president is likely to be competitive in the Electoral College against the three leading Democratic candidates.
To the Editor:
Re "Can Trump Win Independents?" (Op-Ed, Nov. 4) and "Trump Is Remaining Competitive if Not Popular" (front page, Nov. 5):
Matthew Continetti's examination of why Donald Trump is likely toast unless he wins back independent voters and Nate Cohn's analysis of why President Trump can still win battleground states to again put him over the top are both based on an array of polling data. Outside of The Times there are countless more stories about often conflicting national and state polls.
But what are we gaining from this mass of data? Usually a reporter's or a pundit's assessment of a snapshot in time, which will be completely at odds with another's snap assessment tomorrow and the next day and the next week and so on. Three months from the Iowa caucus and one year from the national election, The Times and other media are bombarding readers with data that often seems nonsensical. There's got to be a better method behind this madness!

To the Editor:
Before she was murdered by the Nazis, Anne Frank wrote, "In spite of everything I still believe that people are really good at heart."
When I was a child, I wept when I read that. When I was a young woman, I took comfort from it. Now that I am older, I don't believe it anymore. After reading the polls, with President Trump apparently leading or tied in some, I don't believe that people are good.
That so many Americans still support him -- support the alienation of our allies, the destruction of our values, the death of democracy -- has both incensed and frightened me. We've seen this movie before; it doesn't end well.

To the Editor:
Re "Trump Is Remaining Competitive if Not Popular" (front page, Nov. 5), about polls showing that the president is "highly competitive" against the three top Democratic candidates in battleground states:
A year out from the presidential election the Democrats are already making many of the same fatal mistakes they made in 2016. Elizabeth Warren, whatever her merits as a leader, will never beat Donald Trump in the general election. She, like Hillary Clinton before her, is perceived as too liberal by too many voters. Furthermore, I believe there is little either Ms. Warren or her supporters can do to change this perception over the next 12 months.
On the other hand, Joe Biden is seen as too moderate and ineffectual by many in the party. What will Warren supporters likely to do should Mr. Biden get the nomination? Just what they did in the last election when their favorite son, Bernie Sanders, failed to get it -- stay home in protest.
All the while, President Trump and his people are lapping it up. Right now, things are going far better than even they dared hope.
Joe Elliott
Asheville, N.C.
To the Editor:
It's abundantly clear by now that it is futile for the Democrats to try to win over President Trump's supporters. But there is another way they can win the battleground states, and with them the election: by taking advantage of the surplus of Democratic voters in California and New York. In 2016, the Democrats won those two states by a total of six million votes. If enough of these voters moved to the battleground states -- retirees being the most obvious candidates -- Mr. Trump would be defeated.
I know moving can be a traumatic experience. But if the president can do it, anybody can.

A Plea From Writers: Stop Using 'Quid Pro Quo'

Texto completo: The writers urge The Times to avoid language that people don't understand or that underplays the facts.
To the Editor:
A plea from 33 writers: Please use language that will clarify the issues at hand.
Please stop using the Latin phrase "quid pro quo" regarding the impeachment inquiry. Most people don't understand what it means, and in any case it doesn't refer only to a crime. Asking for a favor is not a criminal act; we frequently demand things from foreign countries before giving them aid, like asking them to improve their human rights record.
That is not a crime; the crime is President Trump's demand for something that will benefit him personally. But using this neutral phrase -- which means simply "this for that" -- as synonymous with criminality is confusing to the public. It makes the case more complicated, more open to question and more difficult to plead.
Please use words that refer only to criminal behavior here. Use "bribery" or "extortion" to describe Mr. Trump's demand to President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, making it very clear that this is a crime. The more we hear words that carry moral imputations, the more we understand the criminal nature of the act.
Please also stop using the phrase "dig up dirt." This slang has unsavory connotations. Instead, please use the more formal, direct and powerful phrase "create false evidence," or "find incriminating evidence" or the simpler "tell lies about."
Words make a difference.
These are parlous times, and we look to public voices for dignity, intelligence and gravitas. Please use precise and forceful language that reveals the struggle in which we now find ourselves. It's a matter of survival.

I like Michael Bloomberg for president. Here's why

Texto completo: “I like Mike."
It's a good campaign slogan, redolent of the Eisenhower era when Republicans and Democrats weren't at each other's throats over absolutely everything. A time when the center held despite extreme pressure from the left and right. When the middle of the road wasn't just for political road kill.
But is Mike — Michael Bloomberg, the pride of Medford and former mayor of New York City — the answer for a Democratic Party deeply divided over the best way to dump Donald Trump? Can the 77-year-old billionaire and former Republican appeal to young progressives at the same time he reassures moderate Democrats and independents that he won't takeway their private health insurance or tax the rich and big corporations to fund every single worthy social program?
These are some of the questions being raised after the revelation Thursday that Bloomberg is preparing to jump into the Democratic primary race. On Friday, he filed papers to be on the primary ballot in Alabama, though a final decision to run has yet to be made.
Bloomberg publicly played Hamlet twice before (in 2016 and earlier this year) before deciding “not to be." But conditions on the ground have changed since he last demurred in March.
The Democratic front-runner, moderate Joe Biden, looks wobbly in debates and is having trouble raising money. Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have passionate followers but are too radical for big chunks of the country. Pete Buttigieg has that Midwest common sense but is too green for many voters.
Bloomberg — who spent heavily on Democrats in the 2018 midterms and in the elections in Virginia this month that put Democrats back in power — is concerned that none of these candidates can stop Trump. Plenty of Democrats feel the same way, including me. (Full disclosure: I worked for Bloomberg's news service from 2005 to 2013, a period when he was on leave from the financial data and services company to run City Hall.)
Politically, Bloomberg isn't so much middle-of-the-road as all-over-the-road.
On social issues, he can be as progressive as Representative Ayanna Pressley and the rest of the Squad. He supports abortion rights and LGBTQ rights, is pro gun control, and has been a big backer of environmental causes.
But Bloomberg has a conservative streak. He stood behind the New York Police Department's controversial “stop-and-frisk" policy, which critics said discriminated against people of color, and made some questionable comments about the #MeToo movement. These would be big problems for progressives, as would his defense of Wall Street (where he made his fortune) and free trade, and his generally pro-business stance.
Bloomberg is very rich. He ranks No. 8 on Forbes list of richest Americans, with a fortune estimated at $53.4 billion. He backs progressive taxation but is against a wealth tax. He is also very generous, having given away more than $6.4 billion to a wide range of causes, including public health, arts and culture, the environment, education, and government innovation.
For anyone who thinks Trump is the cancer on presidency, the lie-awake-at-night question is: What takes priority — idealogy or electability?
Yes, Medicare for All is probably the best way to fix our broken health care system. But is fighting for it now worth losing in November 2020? Wealth inequality threatens our very democracy, but is proposing trillions of dollars in new taxes on the rich playing into Trump's hands?
I go back and forth on this, as I am sure many of you do, too. My heart is with Warren, but my brain tells me she's more Mike Dukakis than Bill Clinton. I don't think Biden or Buttigieg or any of the other declared candidates have much better odds.
Bloomberg isn't perfect either. Like Warren, he tends to think he knows what's best for the rest of us. Like Biden, he is an ultimate insider. His idiosyncratic positions may give everyone something to hate.
But at this moment I think he's the Democrats' best bet.
I like Mike.

Texto completo: When liberals are unable to support their positions with facts, they resort to attacking the character of anyone who disagrees with them. Jackie Adams (10/21/19) accused me of being paranoid, arrogant, intolerant, an isolationist and unable to "discern between opinions and the truth" without any basis/support. She clearly does not understand my opinion letters. I have written letters on:
1. Economic and income tax issues as I have been a CPA since 1975 and I have a Master of Business Administration from the University of Mary.
2. Climate change (3/1 & 7/27/19  Roberta please read). I worked for Basin Electric for 30 years and management was reviewing global warming/climate change in the 90s. I've continued to research/study this issue.
3. Opposing abortion, and in support of Evangelical Christians; I am a practicing Roman Catholic.
I apologize that I didn't include Jackie in my liberal "platoon" list!
Roberta Nelson (10/17/19) called me a fool and accused me of having "selective memory syndrome". Her letter did prompt me to make a phone call and research past editions of the Tribune. After reading publisher, Gary Adkisson's column of October 18, I called him. We cordially agreed that the majority of the opinions, cartoons and the primary news feed (AP) that the Tribune receives are liberal. I apologized for accusing the Tribune of being liberal; they have primarily liberally biased sources (New York Times/Washington Post).
I reviewed the Opinion pages from January 1, 2016  November 8, 2016. There were:
1. No portrayals of President Obama as a monkey (big ears (7); caricature?).
2. Three negative cartoons on Hillary's ethics (Remember her unethical 90s?).
In 2019 there were four cartoons on Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez; three vs. Nancy Pelosi; one on climate.
What do the majority of North Dakotans believe/value? Donald Trump - 63% (2016)!

Texto completo: American professional runner Mary Cain alleged that she was "emotionally and physically abused" by Nike's Oregon Project and coach Alberto Salazar.
In an op-ed for The New York Times published Thursday, Cain wrote that she developed suicidal thoughts and starting cutting herself as a result of the intense tactics and pressure enforced by Salazar.
Cain, now 23, said when she arrived in Eugene at 17 to train for the prestigious track team, she was met with an all-male staff who told her in order to better her performances she needed to become "thinner and thinner and thinner. " No nutritionist was on staff. As a result of the demand from coaching staff, Cain said she broke five bones after she lost her menstrual cycle.
Cain called out Nike directly, noting the company "is not acknowledging the fact that there is a systemic crisis in women’s sports and at Nike, in which young girls’ bodies are being ruined. "
In a public statement responding to the allegations, Nike wrote: “These are deeply troubling allegations which have not been raised by Mary or her parents before. Mary was seeking to rejoin the Oregon Project and Alberto’s team as recently as April of this year and had not raised these concerns as part of that process. We take the allegations extremely seriously and will launch an immediate investigation to hear from former Oregon Project athletes. At Nike we seek to always put the athlete at the center of everything we do, and these allegations are completely inconsistent with our values. ”
The Oregon Project is officially defunct. Cain left the team in 2015 and explained her reasoning for attempting to return in the spring to her old team Friday on Twitter.
"I’m not afraid anymore," she wrote. "As recently as this summer, I still thought: 'maybe if I rejoin the team, it’ll go back to how it was. ' But we all come to face our demons in some way. For me, that was seeing my old team this last spring. "
Olympic runner Kara Goucher blasted Nike for the company's response to Cain, and also affirmed the allegations.
She wrote on Twitter: "So (Nike) responds to (Cain). Takes the time to victim shame Mary, before saying they will investigate. I hope you come to me, because I have stories to match all of Mary’s claims and so much more. Don’t let this be more lip service, actually do something. "
Several other notable runners supported Cain, including New York City Marathon winner Shalane Flanagan, who wrote on social media: "I had no idea it was this bad. We let you down. I will never turn my head again. "
Cain claimed Salazar, who was recently banned from the sport for four years related to doping charges, would publicly shame her in front of teammates if she did not weigh 114 pounds and attempted to give her birth-control pills and diuretics to assist with weight loss.
“I got caught in a system designed by and for men, which destroys the bodies of young girls,” she said.

Resumen: Gwyneth Paltrow shares that she had a 'complicated' relationship with Harvey Weinstein and that she's not sure how she currently feels about him.

Texto completo: Gwyneth Paltrow was one of the first actresses to come forward with sexual misconduct claims against Harvey Weinstein, but two years later, the actress is still conflicted about the subject.
While speaking at the New York Times DealBook Conference, journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin asked Paltrow how she felt about Weinstein.
"You know, I don’t like to be binary about people or about things," the "Avengers" star said. "I think we’re all equal parts or varying percentages light and dark. "
Paltrow worked with Weinstein on well-known projects like "Shakespeare in Love," which earned her an Academy Award.
"He was a very, very important figure in my life. He was my main boss, he gave me incredible opportunity and yet during that time we had a very, very fraught complicated relationship, highs and lows," the Goop founder said. "The postscript to that chapter of my life is where it gets extremely complicated for me, because information came to light about who he was and how he was behaving that I didn’t know during my already very difficult time with him. So I’m not sure, I’m not sure how I feel. "
Weinstein is due to stand trial in Manhattan in January on charges he raped a woman in 2013 and performed a forcible sex act on a different woman in 2006. The 67-year-old producer has pleaded not guilty and is free on $1 million bail. He maintains any sexual activity was consensual.
The trial will occur against the backdrop of the #MeToo movement, which was fueled by public allegations from more than 80 women of sexual misconduct by Weinstein, ranging from sexual harassment to groping to sexual assault to rape.
Sorkin also asked Paltrow's thoughts on the New York Times column, "I Love Gwyneth Paltrow. There. I Said It," which which discusses her relationship with Weinstein.
In the column, Wesley Morris wrote, "I’ve spent two years wondering whether Paltrow’s taste for acting had diminished because of that man, whether having his company seem synonymous with some of her strongest, most popular work compelled her to start a company of her own, one where the work concerned not acting but being, being whole, being better, being ridiculously better. "
Paltrow said, although she tries to never read anything about herself, she was compelled to read Morris' column after it was sent to her by so many people.
"I think he said it better than I could say it myself," Paltrow said. "It’s something that I’ve been processing over the last year or so that I don’t even think that I was aware that it possibly could have tarnished the way that I viewed my first career. "

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - A senior American diplomat has written a highly critical assessment of the Trump administration's abrupt withdrawal of troops from northeast Syria last month, a decision that paved the way for an attack on U.S.-allied forces in the area, officials said Thursday.
In an internal memo, William Roebuck, the top American diplomat in northern Syria, takes the Trump administration to task for not doing more to prevent Turkey's invasion or protect the Kurds, who fought alongside U.S. forces in the battle against the Islamic State group, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the matter.
One of the officials described the memo, which was obtained and first revealed by The New York Times, as "lengthy and harsh." The officials spoke on condition of anonymity.
Roebuck's memo highlights how President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw the troops was deeply divisive, even within his own administration. The move was widely criticized by Democrats and Republicans as abandoning a key ally in the fight against the Islamic State.
Turkey invaded days after Trump ordered the U.S. special forces to leave.
In the memo quoted by the Times, Roebuck said there was no way to know if more pressure on Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, would have stopped the operation.
"It's a tough call, and the answer is probably not. But we won't know because we didn't try," the Times quoted Roebuck as writing.
Trump's ordered withdrawal from the northeast has been somewhat tempered by the deployment of forces to protect oil fields in Kurdish-held areas.
GM selling shuttered factory
in Ohio to electric truck maker
TOLEDO, Ohio - General Motors is selling a massive assembly plant it shut down earlier this year in Ohio, a closing that drew threats and scolding from President Donald Trump, to a newly formed company that said Thursday it intends to begin making electric trucks by late 2020.
The company called Lordstown Motors Corp. plans to hire 400 production workers at the outset, but said it still needs more investors before manufacturing can begin.
GM had employed 4,500 people at the factory near Youngstown just two years ago before it began cutting production and eventually in March ended more than 50 years of car manufacturing there, part of a major restructuring plan.
Terms of the sale and the investors who are behind the deal weren't disclosed by the privately held Lordstown Motors.
French leader laments NATO's 'brain death' due to US actions
BRUSSELS - French President Emmanuel Macron claimed that a lack of U.S. leadership is causing the "brain death" of the NATO military alliance, insisting in an interview published Thursday that the European Union must step up and start acting as a strategic world power.
Macron's public criticism of the state of the world's biggest military alliance was rejected by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, setting the scene for a possible showdown in London next month when NATO leaders meet.
"What we are currently experiencing is the brain death of NATO," Macron told The Economist magazine. He said the United States under President Donald Trump appears to be "turning its back on us."
North Carolina no longer an outlier on sex and consent
GREENSBORO, N.C. - North Carolina's governor has signed a sexual assault bill that says women can revoke consent during sex.
Gov. Roy Cooper said in a news release Thursday that he had signed the bill, which undoes a 1979 court decision that made North Carolina the only state where women can't revoke consent.
The law also undoes a court ruling from 2008 that said sexual assault laws don't apply to people who were incapacitated because of their own action as victims, such as by taking drugs or alcohol. It also increases penalties for child abusers.
The law goes into effect Dec. 1.
Both houses of the legislature approved the bill unanimously last week. Cooper says the bipartisan legislation "will help more people seek justice against abusers."
Okla. woman in failure-to-protect case to be freed
OKLAHOMA CITY - An Oklahoma woman who has served 15 years in prison for failing to report her boyfriend, who served just two years for abusing her children, is scheduled to be released from custody.
The Oklahoma Department of Corrections says Gov. Kevin Stitt has signed the commutation sentence of Tondalao Hall and she is to be released Friday.
Her release comes about after the state Pardon and Parole Board voted unanimously to recommend that Stitt commute her sentence to time served.
Hall's ex-boyfriend, Robert Braxton, pleaded guilty to abusing the children and was released on probation after two years in jail.
The disparity of the sentences outraged women's rights groups and brought further attention to Oklahoma's high rate of incarceration, particularly of women.
Governor of Texas to open homeless camp in Austin
AUSTIN, Texas - Texas' Republican governor said Thursday that he is creating a homeless campsite on 5 acres of state land of the outskirts of downtown in the capital of Austin, escalating a battle with the city's liberal leaders over people living on the streets.
Greg Abbott's announcement was met with a mix of muted welcoming and accusations of political posturing from Democrats who run the state capital around the Texas Governor's Mansion, where Abbott has spent months lashing out at the city's homelessness problem on Twitter.
Abbott spokesman John Wittman said the campsite will have portable restrooms and hand-washing stations. He said it will also provide access to homeless case workers and health care providers until permanent sheltering opens.
In China: A court sentenced nine fentanyl traffickers Thursday in a case that is the culmination of a rare collaboration between Chinese and U.S. law enforcement.
Liu Yong was sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve, while Jiang Juhua and Wang Fengxi were sentenced to life in prison. Six other members of the operation received lesser sentences, ranging from six months to 10 years. Death sentences are almost always commuted to life in prison after the reprieve.
Working off a 2017 tip from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security about an online drug vendor who went by the name Diana, Chinese police busted the drug ring based in the northern Chinese city of Xingtai.

Texto completo: Not that she needed a sales boost, but Elizabeth Strout got one Thursday when Oprah Winfrey named Strout's latest novel, "Olive, Again," as her latest book club pick.
Strout, who splits her time between Brunswick and New York, said the plainspoken Olive Kitteridge would be pleased with the news. "Olive would say, 'Godfrey Mighty!'" Strout told The Associated Press in an email. "But even Olive would be impressed with Oprah onboard with her story. Olive - who would not admit to it publicly - would be really pleased that Oprah finds her life so worthy of respect."
"Olive, Again" follows Strout's "Olive Kitteridge," which was published in 2008 and won the Pulitzer Prize. "Olive, Again" is Winfrey's second pick for her new partnership with Apple. Her first pick, Ta-Nehisi Coates' novel "The Water Dancer," in September, topped the Apple and Amazon.com bestseller lists.
"Olive, Again" debuted at No. 6 on The New York Times' hardcover fiction bestseller list.
Strout retweeted Winfrey's announcement, writing, "Oprah has done so much to support readers and writers over the years. I am really thrilled and honored that she choose OLIVE AGAIN as her next Oprah's Book Club pick!"
In her tweet, Winfrey wrote, "As cranky as Olive is, she teaches us so much about loneliness, empathy & loss. All the things that make us human."

Texto completo: Alphabet Inc.'s board is investigating how the company dealt with accusations of sexual harassment and misconduct against some of its executives.
"As has already been confirmed in public court filings, in early 2019, Alphabet's board of directors formed a special litigation committee to consider claims made by shareholders in various lawsuits relating to past workplace conduct," Alphabet, Google's parent company, said in an emailed statement Wednesday.
The investigation includes the behavior of Chief Legal Officer David Drummond, a longtime senior executive who has been accused of having relationships with employees, CNBC reported Wednesday.

The board of directors has hired a law firm to help with the investigation and contact alleged victims, CNBC also said.
A 2018 New York Times report detailed three accounts of senior Google executives, including Drummond, having relationships with employees. Two of those executives, Andy Rubin and Rich DeVaul, have left the company, but Drummond remains.
In August, a former Google employee, Jennifer Blakely, who participated in the New York Times story, elaborated on accusations she made to the New York Times about Drummond, saying that she was forced out of the company and that he refused to pay child support after their relationship ended.
Drummond has acknowledged the relationship with Blakely. "Other than Jennifer, I never started a relationship with anyone else who was working at Google or Alphabet," he said in a statement in August. He did not return an email seeking comment.
The New York Times also reported last year that Rubin, the founder of Android, was given a $90-million severance package when he left Google in 2014. That news prompted a walkout by thousands of Google employees and has spurred efforts to reform how the company handles sexual harassment and misconduct complaints.
Some shareholders have sued the company over this episode and other workplace conduct, and the Alphabet board's special litigation committee is considering these claims, the Alphabet spokeswoman said Wednesday.

Texto completo: Jeff Sessions formally announced on Thursday that he was entering the Senate race in Alabama, a decision that will likely put him on a collision course with President Trump, who still harbors resentment toward the former attorney general a year after forcing him from office.
In a statement issued just after 8 p.m., Mr. Sessions took pains to signal that he had remained loyal to the president despite their differences. "When I left President Trump's cabinet, did I write a tell-all book? No. Did I go on CNN and attack the president. No. Have I said a cross word about President Trump? No," the statement said. "I was his strongest advocate. I still am. We must make America great again."
The announcement came after several weeks of public leaks and private maneuvering during which the former attorney general tested the waters about running for what would be his fifth term in the Senate. He gave up his seat in 2017 after Mr. Trump nominated him and the Senate confirmed him.
But their relationship soon soured as Mr. Sessions, an adviser to Mr. Trump's first presidential campaign, decided to recuse himself from overseeing the Justice Department's investigation into whether Mr. Trump and his associates worked illegally with Russians to interfere in the 2016 election. Mr. Trump has never forgiven Mr. Sessions, who was the first member of the Senate to endorse his presidential bid.
In his first televised interview since leaving office, Mr. Sessions told Fox News' Tucker Carlson on Thursday that he had no regrets about the recusal. "I did the thing I had to do under the rules of the Department of Justice," he said, acknowledging, "I know how painful this was for the president." He added that he has not yet spoken with Mr. Trump about his Senate campaign but hopes to.
Because Mr. Trump has an almost imperial hold on the Republican Party, Mr. Trump's dislike could make for a rough road ahead for Mr. Sessions. Republicans who find themselves in Mr. Trump's political cross hairs rarely fare well with their party's voters. And the president has sent word to the former attorney general through allies that he would publicly attack him if he went ahead with the campaign.
But Mr. Sessions, 72, has been an admired figure in Alabama Republican politics for four decades and, by many accounts, remains popular there despite the withering scorn Mr. Trump has leveled at him. Among other insults, Mr. Trump has accused Mr. Sessions of betrayal and of being a "total joke" of a leader at the Justice Department. More recently, the president has referred to him as a "jerk" in private conversations.
On the issues, at least, there are few Republicans who are as committed to Mr. Trump's approach. Mr. Sessions was often a lone voice in the Senate arguing to restrict immigration and rescind global free trade agreements. His opposition to immigration reform, in fact, came years before Mr. Trump's conversion on the issue.
In his Fox interview on Thursday night, Mr. Sessions tried to remind people that he was a true believer in these policies long before Mr. Trump's 2016 campaign. "I was for this agenda before President Trump announced."
Mr. Sessions did not undertake the decision to run again lightly. He sought out advice on the race from dozens of friends and associates in Alabama, Washington and beyond in recent weeks. He commissioned polling to test how strong a contender he would be in a Republican primary that is already quite crowded with well known names. The numbers came back indicating that the race was winnable, according to one person who is close to him.
Alabama Republicans have a history of voting their will -- regardless of what Mr. Trump tells them to do. Two years ago during the special election to fill Mr. Sessions's old seat, Mr. Trump endorsed Luther Strange, the Republican leadership's preferred candidate. Mr. Strange lost the primary to Roy S. Moore, the former state chief judge who has a large following among religious conservatives there.
In the general election, Mr. Trump endorsed Mr. Moore and stood by him even after several women came forward to say that the judge had touched them inappropriately when they were teenagers. Mr. Moore lost the race to Senator Doug Jones, who is the first Democrat to represent Alabama in the Senate in a generation.
The prospect of another divisive Republican primary is making many Republicans nervous that Mr. Jones could be re-elected, which would imperil the party's ability to keep its Senate majority. Mr. Moore is running again and announced his bid in June. Two other candidates also appear to be formidable: Representative Bradley Byrne, whose district is near Mobile; and Tommy Tuberville, the former Auburn University football coach.

Texto completo: The simple idea of insurgency versus government proves much more complex when dozens of detained fighters tell their stories in a remote corner of Afghanistan.
FAIZABAD, Afghanistan -- They paced aimlessly inside a guarded compound, stepping over their beard and hair clippings on the ground. Ninety-eight Taliban in all -- fighters as young as 16 and as old as one white-bearded veteran of 65.
They had all laid down their weapons and pledged loyalty to the Afghan government. But the reasons for that depended on who was telling the tale -- and illuminated some of the complexity of a war in which side-switching is common.
The Afghan military says these Taliban fighters quit to try to save their lives after Afghan forces retook three districts from the Taliban during desperate, pitched battles in the northeastern province of Badakhshan in September.
The fighters had been told by the head of the national intelligence agency in the province that they were free to return to civilian life if they renounced the Taliban.
But in the compound's courtyard, some fighters said they had already been planning to do just that before they were taken into custody. Some told of conspiring with friends and relatives from the government to abandon the Taliban even as the battles for the districts were raging.
Others said they had been given no choice but to surrender at gunpoint, then submitted to having their typical Taliban style -- long hair and beards -- trimmed back by a barber.
But they were not speaking freely. They related their stories to visiting New York Times journalists in the presence of a glowering officer from the National Directorate of Security, who often interrupted to correct or admonish them for speaking too frankly.
The courtyard spectacle had all the trappings of a practiced performance, with the fighters politely agreeing with the intelligence officer. But whenever he stepped away, they offered more candid assessments.
Particularly in remote places like Badakhshan, where the central government in Kabul is a distant idea, switching sides between the Taliban, other insurgent groups, and the security forces is a frequent event. Old local rivalries keep playing out across new allegiances. Lapis lazuli and gold mines, coupled with drug-smuggling, add to the complexity.
Several of the men spoke of reluctantly joining the Taliban only after their districts were seized by the militants up to four years ago. They shared a common resentment: the foreign jihadists -- from Pakistan, China, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan -- who commandeered their homes and demanded food.
Brig. Gen. Mohammad Hanif Nuristani, the government intelligence commander in Badakhshan, said there were at least 400 foreign fighters in the province who had joined the Taliban, Al Qaeda or the Islamic State.
"They didn't speak our language, but we shared our food," said Sultan Mohammad, 46, who said he commanded 15 Taliban fighters. "We had no choice, and to protect our families, we supported them."
Mr. Mohammad, who said he was a teacher who supported the government before the Taliban takeover, said he had been in touch by telephone with local government leaders before and during the battles in September.
Asked whether he and his men had surrendered or had been captured, Mr. Mohammed replied, "We weren't captured. We support the government, inshallah."
Nizamuddin, 19, who goes by one name, said he had eagerly joined the Taliban this year because he was intrigued by what he called "their ideology." But when the Afghan military attacked, he said, his older brother -- a government intelligence officer -- telephoned and persuaded him to defect.
He said he switched sides because of the foreign jihadists, whose presence he said drew American airstrikes. "We didn't want them in our homeland but we had no choice," he said.
The intelligence officer, a stocky man in a shiny blue suit who declined to give his name, said the government had provided food, showers and living space for the fighters. At their request, he provided a barber to trim their long hair and wild beards, he said.
"We want to look like the government people," one fighter announced, and his companions laughed uproariously.
The intelligence officer said the fighters, who were allowed to keep their cellphones to reach family members, would be permitted to return home soon. He said they were free to leave the compound, but it was surrounded by armed intelligence agency soldiers who blocked the front entrance.
The fighters had been taken recently to attend a ceremony in Faizabad, the provincial capital, with the government's national security adviser, Hamdullah Mohib. In a Twitter post, Mr. Mohib said the men had renounced violence. He praised them for "choosing the right way" and "endorsing" the government's legitimacy.
Abdullah Naji Nazari, a member of the provincial council, said the fighters "didn't like the Taliban anymore" and now trusted government forces to help them secure their villages.
General Nuristani said the fighters had provided valuable intelligence. "Perhaps we'll send them back as spies for us," he said.
In the courtyard, Mohammad Hassan, a wiry little man who thought he was about 65 years old, said he had fired rocket-propelled grenades at Soviet soldiers in the 1980s and at government troops this year while fighting for the Taliban.
Now, he said, he was perfectly willing to fire the same weapon at his former Taliban comrades, if only the government would arm him. He had been a farmer before joining the Taliban, he said, but now he wanted nothing more than to fight.
"Some people like gardening or parrots," he said, grinning. "I like to fight."
His comrades doubled over in laughter. One of them slapped the old man on the back.
"I'm addicted to war," Mr. Hassan continued. "My nickname is Hassan Rocket!"
There was more laughter, even from the weapons-toting intelligence agency guards.
The spectacle inside the courtyard soon drew to a close, with the intelligence officer signaling that it was time to wrap up. The visitors withdrew. The fighters, some who seemed to have surrendered and some who perhaps had defected, resumed pacing the compound.
One of the guards watched them warily.
"Every one of them is dangerous," he said. "We don't trust a single one."

Texto completo: The case is the first in France to have led to a criminal inquiry into a company's liability for its activities abroad.
PARIS -- A French court on Thursday upheld preliminary criminal charges against one of France's biggest companies over allegations that it financed the Islamic State and other armed groups in Syria, while putting the lives of its employees there in danger.
In its ruling, the Court of Appeal in Paris also said the company, the multinational cement maker Lafarge, had violated international embargoes as it sought to maintain business in Syria despite a civil war.
But the court rejected a separate, more serious charge that the company was complicit in crimes against humanity after former employees accused Lafarge of abetting terrorist groups operating in the region by funneling financing to them.
The ruling paves the way for a possible future trial over the other charges, which are part of an investigation by the French authorities and were brought last year against Lafarge as well as six former executives, including its former chief executive Bruno Lafont.
The case is the first in France to have led to a criminal inquiry into a company's liability for its activities abroad.
The Lafarge plant, on Syria's northern border with Turkey, was shut down after the Islamic State, known as ISIS, attacked it in 2014 as employees fled the factory. It was subsequently converted into a strategic base for the United States military until President Trump withdrew American forces from Syria last month.
"It's an example to multinationals that might feel encouraged not to act legally responsible for the human rights of its employees in other countries," said Marie-Laure Guislain, the head of litigation at Sherpa, a French organization that pursues human rights abuses by corporations. Sherpa filed a lawsuit in 2016 on behalf of the former Lafarge employees in Syria.
Ms. Guislain added that the group would appeal the decision to drop the war crimes charge.
Lafarge, which merged with the Swiss cement giant Holcim in 2015, has acknowledged "unacceptable errors committed in Syria" and that supervisors at its headquarters in Paris and in Syria failed to identify breaches of company rules at the Syrian subsidiary. But it has insisted that the company as a whole is not liable.
"The court has come to the same conclusion as us, that there are no elements to charge Lafarge" for crimes against humanity, Christophe Ingrain and Remi Lorrain, lawyers for Lafarge, said in a statement. Lafarge "must be exonerated for other offenses alleged against it," they added.
The case could take months or even years to go to trial. All of the former Lafarge executives have denied the charges against them. If prosecuted, the executives could face penalties of up to 10 years in jail as well as fines.
It has riveted attention in France, where Lafarge has long been considered a corporate icon with international clout. Mr. Lafont's successor as chief executive, Eric Olsen, resigned in 2017 after an internal inquiry, although Lafarge concluded that he was not responsible for, or aware of, the activity.
In the lawsuit, nearly a dozen former Syrian employees claimed that the company had ignored the risks they faced and pressured them to keep working while war bore down. They alleged that the company had put them in danger in part by making them pass through checkpoints held by ISIS and a rotating cast of other armed militants from 2011 to 2014, and by asking them to keep the plant running even as ISIS increased its deadly presence in the region.
According to French court documents reviewed by The New York Times as well as interviews with former employees, Lafarge is accused of funneling money to intermediaries who conducted negotiations with the Islamic State, as well as Al Qaeda's affiliate in Syria and other armed factions, in order to move supplies and employees through dangerous areas and to secure raw materials.
All told, Lafarge agents paid more than $ 5 million to armed groups, according to the documents, which included statements to investigators by former Lafarge officials, testimony and witness accounts of former employees, company correspondence, and a confidential internal review of Lafarge's Syria operations by the global law firm Baker McKenzie.
The investigation underscores the costs and complexity of doing business in war-torn regions, especially by companies in the energy and industrial sectors.
It is rare for international companies to face charges for crimes against humanity. Of a handful of cases brought in the past, most have been abandoned. Among them was a 2008 lawsuit brought by Burmese refugees against the French oil giant Total, which accused the company of providing support and financing to the Burmese junta that was accused of engaging in forced labor, executions and torture. The case, brought in a Belgian court, was dismissed.

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO — An advocacy group tracking misinformation says it has found an increase in fake political news shared on Facebook ahead of the 2020 presidential election.
The group, Avaaz, said Wednesday that it found that viral misinformation is still being spread on the social network despite measures Facebook has put in place since the 2016 election. The researchers tracked the 100 most widely shared false news stories between Jan. 1 and Oct. 1 this year. The stories they tracked had all been fact-checked and debunked by Facebook's third-party fact-checking partners, which include the Associated Press.
The group found that, collectively, the fake stories were posted more than 2.3 million times and had an estimated 158.9 million views, along with 8.9 million likes, comments, and shares. The false stories targeted both political parties, though Avaaz says the majority were against Democrats and liberals.
Most of the false news sources were individual users or nonofficial political pages. Avaaz, a left-leaning online advocacy group, said stories it found spreading even after they were debunked included one falsely claiming that President Trump's grandfather was a pimp and a tax evader and that his father was a member of the Ku Klux Klan. That story had an estimated 29 million views. Another story falsely claiming that Democratic Representative Ilhan Omar attended an Al Qaeda training camp had an estimated 770,000 views.
Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report late Tuesday.
Avaaz said in the report that the findings are the "tip of the iceberg of disinformation" ahead of the 2020 election.

Trump to speak at New York City Veterans Day Parade
NEW YORK — President Trump may have officially declared himself a full-time Florida resident, but for some reason he keeps returning to his hometown.
On Monday, Trump will be kicking off the 100th annual New York City Veterans Day Parade at Madison Square Park in Manhattan, the event organizers announced Wednesday.
Trump is deeply unpopular in the city, and his visits are often met with protests. On Saturday, Trump popped into Manhattan for an Ultimate Fighting Championship event at Madison Square Garden. The reaction when he arrived: loud boos and some cheers.
The president will give an address at the park. He was also slated to lay a wreath at a memorial inside the park, but the White House decided that he would not after all, according to a parade spokesman, Pat Smith.
Trump will not march in the parade, which begins by the park at 24th Street and Fifth Avenue in Manhattan and proceeds north to 48th Street. It kicks off at noon Monday.
For decades, Trump lived in an eponymous skyscraper on Fifth Avenue in midtown Manhattan. He began his unlikely presidential bid from its lobby. After winning, he moved to Washington, with only a few trips back to New York City.
But in late September Trump declared that his permanent residence was now his Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Fla.
After news broke of the residency change last week, Trump, a Republican, said he had been treated “very badly" by top officials in New York, who are Democrats.
The grand marshals for this year's parade include three Medal of Honor recipients, a Marine who served in the Gulf War, and a decorated Marine infantry officer who served two tours in Iraq.
Douglas McGowan, chairman of the United War Veterans Council, which organizes the annual parade, said in a statement, “This is a day when we put politics aside to focus on honoring our veterans, and to recommit ourselves as a community to providing them with the services they have earned, the services they deserve and, for many, the services they were denied."

Cyclist who flipped off Trump wins election in Va.
The cyclist who lost her job after giving the middle finger to President Trump's motorcade has found a new one after running for local office and ousting a Republican supervisor in Loudoun County, Va., on Tuesday.
The cyclist, Juli Briskman, had been active in local politics before, but in October 2017 she lifted that one specific finger to make a point and ended up gaining the national spotlight.
Trump had just finished a round of golf at his course in Potomac Falls, Va., when his motorcade approached Briskman, who, from the seat of her bicycle, kept her finger raised as the black SUVs passed — and repeated the gesture when she caught up to them in traffic.
News photographers captured images of her protest, and they quickly spread around the Internet. The next week, Briskman was told she needed to resign from her job as a marketing analyst for Akima, a federal contractor in Herndon, Va., for violating its social media policy by posting the images online.
Now, as a newly elected member of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors, Briskman will oversee that same golf course — it's in her district.
Briskman, who ran as a Democrat, defeated the incumbent with just over 52 percent of the vote.
Back in October 2017, Briskman said her “blood started boiling" when Trump's motorcade began to pass her.
“I just got angry," she said then. “I lifted my arm and started flipping him off. I started thinking, 'You're golfing again when there is so much going on right now.' "
She filed a lawsuit over her firing, but it was dismissed by a state judge.
Briskman said in a tweet Tuesday night that she was proud to “#FlipVA."
Both chambers of the State Legislature flipped from Republican to Democratic control Tuesday.

Texto completo: On a stage in the jewel box theater at the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theatre headquarters, the vibrant warmth and quick wit of the man who capped a 15-year career performing with the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater with 30 years as the company's associate artistic director-Masazumi Chaya-charmed and delighted an adoring audience. With host Renee Robinson, herself a former Ailey dancer (1981-2012), the two created a most engaging evening of dance history.
The two sat center stage on raised chairs separated only by a neat little table supporting a vase of flowers and a basket of props, including three books Chaya joked would come in handy if he needed help recalling specific details. In fact, the books-biographies of Alvin Ailey, Judith Jamison and Robert Battle-could serve as sources for anyone whose appetite was whetted by Chaya's animated recollection of stories of a life well-lived.
Joking that the set reminded him of "Inside the Actor's Studio," Chaya needed only one question from Robinson to launch into what was not so much an interview as a conversation that was as thrilling as it was informative. In addition to years of working with Chaya, Robinson's homework included digging up the review by New York Times critic Clive Barnes that resulted in Chaya being invited to join the AAADT in 1972 when he had only come to help his friend and fellow artists, Michihiko Oka, negotiate a contract.
Chaya's journey brought him from Fukuoka, Japan, where despite parents trying to steer him toward a career in medicine, he studied ballet and eventually took a leap of faith and came to New York to pursue a dance career. As he recalled those early years it was clear that a series of signposts pointed him toward the AAADT at a time when the company was about to be catapulted into a dance stratosphere. The company would offer Chaya a creative home and family and a wealth of entertaining stories to share-and share he did. After joining the then 28-member company it wasn't long before Ailey made Chaya the company's assistant rehearsal director then rehearsal director for two years. He was also a master teacher, both on tour with the company and in his native Japan where he served as choreographic assistant to Ailey and John Butler before being named associate artistic director in 1991 after Judith Jamison assumed the position of artistic director when Ailey passed.
Taking the audience on a trip down memory lane with Robinson's clever prodding, Chaya shared and even reenacted stories associated with some of the company's repertory. There was the time, during a performance of George Faison's "Gazelle," when dancer Sarita Allen was supposed to drop to the floor only to be carried off when the stage lights went temporarily dark. Chaya reenacted Allen's brilliant improvisation dropping to the floor and waiting a second before bolting up and dancing off stage as Allen had done leaving the audience thinking her moves were part of the planned choreography.
Infusing all of his anecdotes with that same energy Chaya carried the audience on a magical mystery tour that captured memories of what it was like to work with Alvin, how he broke the news that he wanted to stop dancing while he was still on top prompting Ailey to offer him his next big gig with the company. There were stories of how he used to stand in the wings and watch every performance of Judith Jamison in her magnificent solo, "Cry," crying himself at the masterful way she injected every move with nuance and meaning. At one point, Robinson had him hold up paddles with smiley faces on them as she read off a list of the dances he'd performed so he could share stories. What a wonderful rapid-fire way to share a lively personal history.
In fact, the entire evening was as special as Masazumi Chaya is and, we were happily informed, he would continue to be since he will help maintain the Ailey legacy by mounting treasures from the Ailey repertory on companies all-around the world.

Texto completo: EACH YEAR, the Main Event is where the Greater Philadelphia Jewish community gathers to celebrate our unity and pride. Some years, it's been a collective opportunity to honor someone who has positively impacted our communities. In other years, we've come together to share our love of Israel. This year, against a rising tide of worldwide anti-Semitism, and with our need for solidarity more urgent than ever, the Main Event 2019 will be a celebration of our communal strength.
Our featured speaker, Bari Weiss (pictured), is a writer and editor for The New York Times opinion section who has been recognized as a leading journalist and commentator. After the Tree of Life killings in her hometown of the Squirrel Hill section of Pittsburgh, she was stirred to action. The result is her newly released book, "How to Fight Anti-Semitism," in which she makes a powerful case for renewing both Jewish and American values. Her Main Event keynote is not to be missed!
Come together on November 14th at the Kimmel Center and find security in the strength of our communal bonds. Proceeds from the Main Event will support the Jewish Community Fund of the Jewish Federation of Greater Philadelphia and our communities' security needs, so that we can continue our sacred mission of serving vulnerable populations, inspiring community engagement and supporting Jewish life and learning.

Texto completo: tampabay.com/letters/ to write us

Moffitt deserves all of our support

Tampa Bay today is blessed with some outstanding health care facilities in contrast to 30 years ago, when one had to leave the state for any serious medical procedure. In cancer care especially, leaving the state was the norm back in the day. Today Tampa Bay is home to a nationally recognized institution, the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center, a world-class research institution and hospital. It is one of only 50 National Cancer Institute-designated comprehensive cancer centers in the United States. Due to its rise in stature and patient demand, Moffitt is out of room. To meet demand for its services and to be able to accommodate additional researchers who want to work there, Moffitt must build more beds and labs to get the work of curing cancer done. It is imperative that the state Legislature pass bills mandating a reallocation of annual tobacco tax monies to fund Moffitts needs. Fortunately, there are several legislators who appreciate the tremendous strides that Moffitt has made in these last few decades and are supporting the additional funding. Thanks to state Sen. Wilton Simpson and Rep. Jamie Grant for filing the bills that can make this happen. I implore the Legislature to support the long-term vision of the donors, staff, leadership and, especially, the patients who will benefit from an expanded, more robust facility that we are so fortunate to have, the Moffitt Cancer Center.

A moral duty to stop killings

The sickening murder of American women and children in Mexico raises serious questions about relationships, risks and appropriate responses. Many Americans visit Mexico, many retire there, deadly drugs are sent from Mexico to the United States to meet American demand, weapons are smuggled from the United States to Mexico, and neither Mexican nor U.S. law enforcement can control multiple problems with drug cartels. The ambush killings further complicate what American immigration policy and law must be on the southern border. Clearly Mexico and the United States must cooperate to break the cartels and bring the killers to justice. This tragedy among others also speaks to updating and tightening immigration enforcement. Mexico and the United States have a moral duty to solve and punish the murders.

James Gillespie, St. Petersburg

Citrus County censorship

I am appalled by the Citrus County Commissions censorship. Elected officials refuse to pay for the digital New York Times for library card holders because the man in the Oval Office calls it fake news? What has this country come to when elected officials can propose something so completely contrary to nature, reason or common sense? We citizens better get our act together and stop being led around by the nose by political parties and politicians. Blind allegiance to party over country is not only dangerous, its downright stupid. It never serves the will of the people  never. It is counterproductive. No wonder we look like a Third World country these days. We should heed President George Washington who, in his farewell address to the nation, warned against the baneful effects of the spirit of party as inciting American citizens with ill-founded jealousies. Without the free press, America could devolve into dictatorship.

Texto completo: The 2019 tech IPO scene is quickly devolving from land of opportunity to a horror show. This week alone, shares of Uber, the most hyped IPO at the start of the year, fell more than 10% due to the one-two punch of a disappointing third-quarter earnings report on Monday and the expiration of its IPO lock-up period on Wednesday (meaning that early investors and employees were allowed to dump their holdings, causing a flood of share supply in the market).
The stock plummets—on top of Uber’s already ailing public market performance—dragged share price to a record low of $27 on Thursday morning, a whopping 40% below its IPO price in May.
SEE ALSO: Uber Hopes to Be the ‘Operating System for Your Everyday Life’
But Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has chosen to put on a brave face in front of disheartened investors. Speaking at The New York Times ‘ DealBook conference in New York City on Wednesday, Khosrowshahi blamed the unfavorable market climate, instead of internal problems, for Uber’s dramatic stock fall.
“There has been a fundamental re-valuation of revenue growth and the value of profits in an increasingly uncertain world,” he said. “And I think the appetite for the unknown and for high risk in the public markets has just gone down and that has consequences.”
Maybe he has a point. After all, Uber isn’t the only IPO company that has taken a hit from the market’s rising skepticism against tech unicorns.
Its ride-sharing peer, Lyft, has seen a stock crash just as big, losing 40% of value since its IPO in March. Shares of Pinterest, another hotly watched IPO this year, tumbled 20% last week on worse-than-expected third-quarter earnings, despite decent overall metrics otherwise.
“In this environment, we are advantaged against our competition,” Khosrowshahi said, “and at the same time… the hurdle for success and the demands of the market are higher. One of [these things] is great, one of them is tough, but I think it’s going to force us to perform.”
In the third quarter, Uber posted a loss of $1.2 billion. But Khosrowshahi argued that the company should reach profitability soon at its current pace of growth.
“In our ride-share business, in the past two quarters, 80% of our revenue growth ran through into EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization). So when I look at the next two years, I’ll do $8 billion in revenue growth and I need about $3 billion of that to drop to the bottom line [for profitability],” he explained, “which is about 38% flow through. And I just demonstrated 80% flow through in two quarters. So, you actually have to do the math, and the math works.”

US newsrooms practically blame Mormon family after brutal slaughter in Mexico

Texto completo: The line in media between poor editorial choices and anti-religious agitprop was blurred again this week after newsrooms appeared to blame the victims of a massacre in Mexico, which claimed the lives of three adult women and six children and left an additional five children injured.
The victims, all U.S. citizens, were members of a Mormon community that settled decades ago in northern Mexico. The mothers and their children had traveled in three separate vehicles Monday from their settlement in Sonora, Mexico, to a wedding in neighboring Chihuahua. Along the way, gunmen believed to be in the service of the cartels ambushed them, killing nine and leaving the rest for dead. Of the murdered, the oldest was 43-year-old Dawna Langford, and the youngest victims were 8-month-old twins, Titus Alvin Miller and Tiana Gricel Miller.
Yet, here is a sampling of how some American newsrooms have covered the ruthless massacre:
“Brutal Killings Spotlight Small Religious Sect in Mexico,” declared a since-amended New York Times headline. The story’s subhead declared also, “Fundamentalist religious communities have a long history in northern Mexico, dating back to settlers who practiced polygamy.”
The story’s opening line read originally, “The brutal killing of nine members of an American family in northern Mexico on Monday highlights the long history of religious fundamentalist settlers in the region.”
Really? That is what the brutal murders highlight?
The New York Times article also reported originally, “Initially, the family’s patriarch was part of a wave of religious rebels who headed south to practice polygamy, once it was banned by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ... The settlers who put down stakes included Miles Park Romney, the great-grandfather of Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, and the party’s presidential nominee in 2012.”
New York Times editors amended the report later to ease its overwhelmingly unserious and insensitive tone.
But the newspaper’s tweet promoting the story is still live.
“The brutal killing of 9 members of an American family in northern Mexico on Monday highlights the long history of religious fundamentalist settlers in the region,” the New York Times said in a tweet that is as off-putting as the report it was hyping.
Tweet
On the other side of the country, the L.A. Times went with an article titled, “U.S. victims in Mexico massacre were tied to family with a long history of violence.”

The article adds, “Some of the victims shared the last name LeBaron. … The family is perhaps best known for a series of killings perpetrated in the 1970s and 1980s, in both Mexico and the United States, by Ervil LeBaron — once called the ‘Mormon Manson’ — and a group of his followers.”
These families have not even buried their children yet, and here is the L.A. Times “dredging up completely unrelated events, committed by distant relatives, that happened more than a generation ago,” as the Dispatch’s David French accurately put it.

On the other side of the Atlantic Ocean, the Daily Mail reported that the “Mexico community that lost three mothers and six children in cartel massacre was founded by U.S. citizens fleeing a polygamy ban and has been blighted by drug violence, murder and abuse for decades.”

The report adds breathlessly, “And in 2016 one former resident detailed a harsh life inside the community.”
The Associated Press went with similar coverage, publishing a report Thursday titled, "Mexican killings spotlight Mormon history with polygamy."
"The slaying in Mexico of nine people who belonged to a Mormon offshoot community where some people practice polygamy spotlights the mainstream church’s struggle to distance itself from plural marriage, which has a history in the faith but has long been denounced," it reads.
Tweet
The only really pertinent detail regarding the LeBarons and what is believed to be a cartel-led massacre is that Benjamin LeBaron "was shot dead after speaking out against traffickers who kidnapped his brother for a $1-million ransom," as the L.A. Times recounts (the New York Times originally made no mention of Benjamin LeBaron denouncing the cartels). That detail could in some way explain Monday's massacre, but that is the only fact presented by the newsrooms mentioned in the above that has any immediate bearing on the slaughter. All this stuff about "fundamentalists," "settlers," polygamy, and "harsh" community life is needless gawking, and it comes at the expense of a family that has likely not even started the process of grieving.
Is it tone-deafness that allowed for these stories to go to print as they did? Or is there some sort of feverishly anti-religious bias that clouds the better judgment of reporters and editors covering a story involving butchered children?

Before we start dredging up decades-old stories about things their ancestors did, maybe we should let these families bury their dead.

Texto completo: Michael Bloomberg is probably running for president. That's bad news.
According to the New York Times, the former New York City mayor is making preparations to file for the Alabama Democratic primary. Alabama isn’t an early voting state, but it has an early registration deadline. Key Bloomberg advisers told the Times that this doesn’t mean he’ll surely enter the race, but that he will if he thinks it’s necessary: “We now need to finish the job and ensure that Trump is defeated — but Mike is increasingly concerned that the current field of candidates is not well positioned to do that.”
While I certainly understand the abstract appeal of the idea of adding a more moderate voice to a Democratic primary field that currently boasts Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders as front-runners, voters shouldn’t mistake Bloomberg for someone any more hospitable to liberty and freedom. In fact, the former mayor has made an entire career out of cracking down on individual liberty and building up the nanny state.
Don’t forget, he spent his tenure as NYC mayor fighting the problems that truly matter by ... attempting to ban large sodas? And since leaving office, he’s spent much of his time crusading against vaping despite it being much healthier than traditional smoking.
Even on more serious issues, Bloomberg shows contempt for freedom and constitutional liberties. For instance, he supports a robust anti-Second Amendment agenda, which includes everything from so-called universal background checks to all-out bans on certain types of guns to bans on entire age groups from exercising their right to self-defense. And he’s spent millions of dollars trying to elect legislators willing to whittle away at the Second Amendment.
He fairs only somewhat better on First Amendment issues.
For instance, Bloomberg openly dismisses the idea of a free press when he says he expects his reporters at Bloomberg News to never cover him critically. Imagine that attitude in the Oval Office in the hands of someone who has already displayed ample willingness to use the powers of the government to squash individual liberties. Bloomberg’s contempt for press freedom led even a Washington Post writer to decry his “disturbing attitude toward the First Amendment — and democracy generally.”
Oh, and Bloomberg thinks marijuana legalization is “the stupidest thing anyone has ever done.” That’s right, he believes we should throw people in cages for smoking a plant in their backyard. Of course, I doubt the mayor wants to play by his own rules — he has admitted to smoking weed in the past.
There are, of course, some things to like about Michael Bloomberg. He supported charter schools as mayor of New York City and is at least somewhat fiscally conservative. And in a field that included aspirants as insufferable as Beto O’Rourke and Bill de Blasio, there’s no way he’ll be the most obnoxious candidate we’re forced to hear out.
But none of this makes the mayor’s policy positions any less disqualifying.
Bloomberg’s affinity for the nanny state and antipathy toward personal liberty led a writer at the libertarian magazine Reason to dub him a “billionaire busybody who can be counted on to oppose individual freedom in almost every area of life.” Let’s hope that billionaire busybody doesn’t become our next president.

Texto completo: QUALCOMM
Profit Slump
Starts to Ease
Qualcomm Inc. signaled a strong year ahead for 5G phone sales. The San Diego chip maker gave its first forecast for global 5G smartphone shipments of between 175 million and 225 million next year. It reported revenue in its fiscal fourth quarter of $4.81 billion, down 17% from a year earlier, but exceeding a FactSet analyst survey consensus estimate of $4.76 billion.
On an adjusted basis, earnings per share fell to 78 cents, above analysts' expectations and at the higher end of a range management forecast three months ago.
The company said it shipped 152 million chips in the quarter, down 34% from a year earlier, underscoring the effect of trade turmoil and a handset market where many manufacturers are trying to sell down 4G phone inventories before they introduce 5G ones.

FOX
Revenue Gains From
Programming Fees
Fox Corp. said Wednesday its quarterly revenue rose 5%, boosted by growth at its television unit and higher proceeds from its Los Angeles studio lot, which is being leasing to rivals.
Fox, which was spun off from 21st Century Fox earlier this year after a sale of most of its assets to Walt Disney Co., is now built around Fox News, the Fox broadcast network and television stations, and Fox Sports.
Revenue for the quarter ended Sept. 30 was $2.67 billion, roughly in line with analysts' estimates. Revenue at the television unit grew 6.2% to $1.36 billion, thanks in part to a 14% rise in programming fees from third-party Fox affiliates and higher average rates per subscriber.
Fox and The Wall Street Journal parent News Corp share common ownership.

NEW YORK TIMES
Subscriptions Fail to
Offset Ad Losses
New York Times Co. reported strong digital-subscription growth in the third quarter, but earnings suffered from a drop in advertising revenue, which the company said would accelerate in the following quarter.
The Times reported net income of $16.4 million, or 10 cents a share, for the quarter, down 34% from $25 million, or 15 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier. On an adjusted basis to exclude severance and some retirement costs, earnings per share were 12 cents.
Revenue rose 2.7% to $428.5 million from $417.3 million in the third quarter last year, driven by a 3.7% increase in subscription revenue and a 26% rise in other revenue, mostly coming from the Times's new television program, "The Weekly."
Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had forecast adjusted earnings of 10 cents a share on revenue of $429.1 million.
Advertising revenue fell 6.7% to $113.5 million. Revenue from digital advertising declined 5.4% to $54.7 million, while print advertising revenue dropped 7.9% to $58.9 million. The company forecast that both total advertising revenue and digital ad revenue would fall in the fourth quarter by a percentage in the midteens.

BMW
Results Bounce Back
On SUV Sales Boost
BMW AG returned to profit in the third quarter, helped by cost-cutting and a sales shift to higher-margin sport-utility vehicles. The company undertook a large cost-cutting program earlier this year after its profit margin was eroded by slowing sales and the costs of shifting toward electric cars and self-driving technology. It said its efforts to boost earnings were bearing fruit and could see it achieve annual savings of 12 billion euros ($13.3 billion) by the end of 2022.
Net profit in the quarter rose to 1.52 billion euros from 1.36 billion euros a year earlier. Its closely watched pretax profit margin in its automotive business rebounded to 6.6% of sales from 4.4% a year ago.
Revenue rose nearly 8% to 26.7 billion euros on strong sales in China. New car sales rose 3.6% on the back of higher X3 and X4 SUV sales. BMW's quarterly earnings were largely in line with analyst forecasts

Texto completo: MUNICH -- Inside an airplane hangar about 20 miles from central Munich, Daniel Wiegand lifted the door of a prototype that he said would become one of the world's first flying taxis. He's coy about how much it cost to build -- "several million," he says -- but promises that within five years a fleet of them could provide a 10-minute trip from Manhattan to Kennedy International Airport for $ 70.
A lot is riding on his plane. Mr. Wiegand, 34, is the chief executive and a founder of Lilium, one of the most promising and secretive start-ups in the global race to build an all-electric aircraft that will -- regulators and public opinion willing -- move passengers above cities.
"This is the perfect means of transportation, something that can take off and land everywhere," Mr. Wiegand (pronounced VEE-gand) said. "It's very fast, very efficient and low noise."
Expectations that aerial taxis will be a reality in the coming years are quickly building. Companies like Lilium are testing their machines, laying the groundwork for wider production and starting discussions to gain support from government officials.
At least 20 companies are in the market, which Morgan Stanley estimates will top $ 850 billion by 2040. Larry Page, the billionaire co-founder of Google, is financially backing Kitty Hawk, a company run by the first engineers on Google's autonomous car. Boeing and Airbus have projects underway. Automakers including Daimler, Toyota and Porsche are investing in the sector. Uber is developing an air taxi service, with plans to open by 2023 in Los Angeles, Dallas and Melbourne, Australia.
Yet saying your plane could fly over Manhattan in five years doesn't mean it will. Building durable jets at a reasonable cost still presents engineering and technical challenges. And a long process awaits with regulators, including the Federal Aviation Administration, that will need to weigh safety concerns.
"The question is can we build a platform that is broadly accessible to everybody and is not just a rich person's toy, and can we build it so quiet that people on the ground aren't annoyed by it?" said Sebastian Thrun, the chief executive of Kitty Hawk.
Lilium, which has raised more than $ 100 million from investors, illustrates the high-wire act of the companies trying to live up to the hype.
The black-and-white aircraft shown by Mr. Wiegand is less "Jetsons"-like flying car than a glider, with a carbon fiber body and 36-foot wingspan. Like several other flying taxis in development, it is battery powered, providing a range of 186 miles and a top speed of nearly 190 miles per hour. Inside the oval cabin will eventually be plush seats and other comforts for four passengers and a pilot.
The engines are packed inside four wings with flaps that rotate so the aircraft can take off and land vertically like a helicopter. But it is quieter than a helicopter, so it could potentially land in some areas traditionally off limits to aircraft.
The costs of the jets may eventually fall to several hundred thousand dollars each, Mr. Wiegand said. And with lower maintenance costs because there are fewer mechanical components, rides should cost roughly the same as an Uber or a taxi ride. Insurance companies have told him that they will provide him with risk coverage.
If successful, he said, the jets will transform urban transportation, with customers using Lilium's app to book a flight from a network of small airports that connect suburbs, college towns and other hubs to cities. Imagine, he said, jets connecting areas across California or southern Germany that don't have high-speed train lines.
Eric Allison, the head of Uber's flying taxi effort, said the technological hurdles were less complex than for autonomous vehicles; there is less traffic in the air, and the first generations of the aircraft will have pilots.
Still, Mr. Allison said, no company has received government certification to fly commercially.
"That's a tall order," he said.
Then there are the many other obstacles to overcome. Battery technology limits how far the vehicles can fly. Building a prototype is different from starting mass production. And the price of the machines, and operating them, needs to be low enough to make rides affordable for customers.
Regulators could slow development by limiting the number of takeoffs and landings on desirable routes. There aren't enough air traffic controllers now to handle a big influx of flights across cities. One fatal accident and demand could dry up.
"This is going to be a test of staying power -- an ability to lose money, an ability to ride out a failure," said Adam Jonas, a lead author of the Morgan Stanley report on the industry. "Many will fail."
Lilium is years away from making money and, with more than 300 employees and an expensive research and development budget, is burning through cash. Mr. Wiegand said it would have to raise more money.
"It's not enough to just build a nice prototype and fly it around," he said. "What we really need to be successful is building a company that's capable of designing, certifying, manufacturing and operating these aircraft in very large scale."
Lilium has said little publicly beyond releasing a few engineering specifications and declaring that it will be carrying customers by 2025. It is seeking certification for its jet from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency and plans to do the same with the F.A.A. The hypothetical New York route is more of a long-term goal.
After accepting an invitation to be the first journalists to see its jet, reporters from The New York Times arrived at Lilium's headquarters last month only to face restrictions on what they could photograph or see. Executives say the company has completed hundreds of test flights and simulations, but none were held during the visit because of rain and wind. (Last month, Lilium released a slickly produced video showing its jet completing a test flight.)
American rivals say they know little about Lilium beyond its hiring of experienced aviation executives from Rolls-Royce, Airbus and Raytheon to oversee areas such as manufacturing, quality control and procurement. Even Angela Merkel, Germany's chancellor and a trained physicist, is intrigued. At an aviation conference last year, she stopped by Lilium's booth and peppered Mr. Wiegand with questions about the battery, flight range and engines.
Mr. Wiegand said secrecy was necessary to keep rivals from learning too much. Unlike other jets that look similar to the small commercial drones that can be bought in a store, Lilium's plane has packed 36 smaller engines in its rotating wings that act as thrusters for takeoffs, landings, and subtle movements forward and back. Encasing the engines in the wings reduces friction and noise.
"Nobody has one with the performance we have," Mr. Wiegand said.
He came up with the idea for Lilium during college, working out the engineering specifications while many of his friends were out drinking. He founded the company with three others in 2015, borrowing money and persuading suppliers to provide some free parts to begin building a small prototype.
After proving it worked, they raised money from investors including Niklas Zennström, a co-founder of Skype who now runs Atomico, a venture capital firm in London. In 2017, the Chinese internet giant Tencent led an investment of $ 90 million.
Nobody has flown inside Lilium's jet. Test flights are done remotely from the ground. But Mr. Wiegand, who was flying gliders at age 14, promises to be one of the first.
"I was flying long before I was allowed to drive a car," he said.

Texto completo: Thousands of books were here, there and everywhere as Severna Park resident Maggie Cullman and Pasadena residents Stacey Hilder and Cathy Crowley were in the final stages of organizing them for the American Association of University Women's annual book sale on Oct. 30. The sale is AAUW's major fundraiser supporting scholarships for women.
Used book dealers invited from Baltimore, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Georgia had come and gone.
But there was still much to do prior to a reception for AAUW members, family and friends that evening. A three-day sale to the public would follow from Oct. 31 through Sunday.
Cullman, Hilder and Crowley breathed a sigh of relief as they placed the last of the books on shelves in a section marked "Thrillers". Neatly printed signs marked every section and price lists were posted.
Volunteers' work began the morning of Oct. 25, as used books collected over several months were trucked from donated storage spaces in Jeannie Hahn's Severna Park garage and at Easy Storage in Arnold to a donated Festival at Pasadena storefront.
The scene inside the storefront was hectic as AAUW members scrambled to deal with multiple loads. Movers carried in box after box of books, piling them from floor to ceiling in a back room and on the main floor.
Unpacking and arranging them continued every day from 9 am to 7 pm through October 30 with 37 AAUW volunteers and 11 guest helpers taking turns emptying boxes.
"Guest helpers included husbands, brothers and grandsons - anyone fit for heavy lifting," Crowley said. "When finished, we had a backroom full of empty boxes."
Book accumulation activities for 2019 began in July when AAUW members marched in the Severna Park Independence Day Parade and handed out bookmarks advertising collection days at sites in Annapolis, Arnold and Severna Park. They also personally picked up volumes from community residents wishing to donate their collections.
"These days, we're getting more books and people are buying more books so it takes us a full five days to unpack and organize," Cullman said. "A gentleman donated 7,000 books to us this year."
Deciding where to place books was challenging for volunteers. There were sections marked for children, youth, and teens and for science fiction, history, religion and health. There was a huge section for cookbooks.
A separate room boasting floor-to-ceiling shelving units marked "Thrillers" contained hardbacks from New York Times bestselling mystery writers like Robert B. Parker, Michael Connelly, David Baldacci and John Grisham plus action-adventure writers like Tom Clancey.
In addition, tables of paperback versions overflowed onto the floor.
The 6:30 pm reception was meant as a thank you to members who volunteered and as an invitation for 100 plus AAUW members to shop ahead of the official sale days. Hilder's son David and granddaughter Allison, a fourth-grader at St. Martin's-in-the-Field Episcopal School, arrived early. Both were guest helpers. Cullman's husband David turned up as well and said he enjoyed volunteering.
"I find it fascinating to open one of the boxes," he said. "It's like a person's whole history is exposed through the contents of the box...their interests, their religion, their health."
Price lists revealed that, for adults and teens, hardback books were $2, soft/trade books $1.50 and paperbacks $1. Children's large or hardback books were $1 and small books were 50¢.
So kids like Morgan Kokalis, who came with dad Darren, got lots of books. She had an armload when AAUW member Carolyn Kokalis - her grandmother - arrived with her aunt Debbie McKenzie and handed her an 11th book, "Better Homes & Gardens Cookbook for Children".
Amber Kaltz's son Nathan happily chose a book in the teen section called "Wildlife Preserves". Amber, communications coordinator for St. Martin's-in-the-Field Episcopal Church, helped with the book sale for three years before becoming an AAUW member.
"I eventually joined because I so love the sale and what the organization does with the funds raised," she said.
The day after the sale, Crowley reported a high volume of sales with traffic good all week.
"We moved more books than ever," she said. "Proceeds will fund scholarships for girls and women to Anne Arundel Community College and our Women to Women program for individuals returning to the workplace or opening businesses."
Removal Day on Monday saw BIG (Books for International Goodwill) coming to pick up remaining non-fiction books. The rest were bundled by helpers like member Coleen Kane's husband Tom and trucked to used book buyer Wonder Books in Hagerstown, Maryland.

AAUW member Amber Kaltz and son Nathan browsed the "Teen" section where the science and nature-oriented youngster selected the book "Wildlife Preserves." Amber volunteered to work the annual book sale for the past three years.

Texto completo: Is there some kind of dance explosion going on? Because after mid-October’s big weekend for dance, then the Twin Cities Tap Festival, Dorrance Dance and Ireland’s Teaċ Daṁsa, here come four more irresistible performances. If you time it right and your budget allows, you can see all four, each expressing different perspectives and aspects of humanity.
Thursday (Nov. 7) at Northrop: Black Grace. Founder and artistic director Neil Ieremia is part Samoan, and most of his dancers are of Samoan, Tongan and Maori heritage and descent. His personal hero is Bruce Lee. Black Grace is New Zealand’s leading contemporary dance company. New York Times dance critic Brian Seibert saw them last week in the program they’ll bring to their Northrop debut. He wrote, “The distinguishing spirit of this troupe is incredible speed and stamina, an exhilarating, seemingly inexhaustible energy.” The dances explore masculinity, hope and the company’s history. The music includes live drumming, hip-hop and selections from Bach’s Brandenburgs. 7:30 p.m. FMI and tickets ($21-50). Free performance preview at 6:15 in the Best Buy Theater.
Thursday through Saturday in the Tek Box at the Cowles: Mathew Janczewski’s Arena Dances: “One Room.” Launching Arena Dances’ 24th season, this new evening-length work meditates on a main question of our divisive times: “How do we come together in one room, face conflict and negotiate so that we can find strength as one collective voice?” Created collaboratively by Janczewski and the all-female sextet of dancers, it will be performed to music by Nils Frahm. Janczewski has said that seeing Frahm live at the Cedar brought him “transcendent joy.” 7:30 p.m. Thursday through Saturday, also 2 p.m. Saturday. Tickets here ($24/15).
Friday and Saturday at the Lab Theater: Ashwini Ramaswamy: “Let the Crows Come.” A dancer and choreographer with Ragamala Dance, the internationally known, Minneapolis-based company led by her mother, Ranee, and her sister, Aparna, Ashwini Ramaswamy is the only member of her family who wasn’t born in India. Like a petite colossus, she has a foot in both worlds. Ragamala treats the ancient dance form of Bharatanatyam as a living thing; in this new project, the culmination of a two-year Liquid Music residency, Ashwini pushes it further, creating three unique choreographic and sonic worlds with herself as the through line. With dancer/choreographers Alanna Morris-Van Tassel and Berit Ahlgren, a Carnatic chamber ensemble, electro-acoustic cellist Brent Arnold and DJ Jace Clayton. This will be the U.S. premiere. 8 p.m. FMI and tickets ($25/20; free for students and children 6-17).
Friday and Saturday at the Walker: Bruno Beltrão/Grupo de Rua: “Inoah.” A rare U.S. performance by the 10-member all-male Rio-based group famed for its popping, breaking and apparent indifference to gravity. Founder and choreographer Beltrão created “Inoah” in 2017, before Jair Bolsonaro became Brazil’s president and parts of the Amazon rainforest were set ablaze. He recently told the New York Times, “If we were not having [much] support before, now it’s totally unthinkable to have any kind of financial support in Brazil. We don’t have … one single invitation [to perform] in our country.” The dance includes moments of profound stillness; it’s not all bouncing, spinning and sliding. 8 p.m. FMI and tickets ($28/$22.40).
The picks
Tonight (Wednesday, Nov. 6) at St. Catherine University: Erika Lee: “Americans First, Immigrants Last: A History of Xenophobia in the United States.” St. Kate’s expects a big turnout for this core convocation event, so plan accordingly. In her book, Lee argues that Americans have feared and hated immigrants from the colonial era to the Trump era. How did this come to be, and what is at stake today? 7 p.m. in the Rauenhorst Ballroom, Coeur de Catherine building. FMI. Free.
Thursday at the Mall of America: Santa’s Arrival Ceremony. Don’t blame us for what seems like a way-too-early start to the holiday season. But Santa’s arrival in a parade led by the Eden Prairie High School Marching Band sounds pretty darned magical for little ones. Here are the details. 6-7 p.m. in the Rotunda.
Friday at Raymond Avenue Gallery: Opening reception for the 6th Annual Yunomi Invitational. Each year, countless pottery fans and collectors squeeze into a small gallery in St. Paul’s Creative Enterprise Zone to look at hundreds of small cups without handles. What bizarre behavior is this? Yunomi – the clay or porcelain cups in question – are traditionally used for tea, but Minnesotans use them for all sorts of things: tea, whiskey, wine, pencils. They’re reasonably inexpensive, highly collectible, and they make great gifts. Each is a little window into the soul and aesthetic of its maker. This year’s invitational will feature work by 38 area potters. Many will be at the reception. 6-8 p.m. Exhibition closes Dec. 20, with extended gallery hours between now and then.
Starts Friday at the Guthrie: Theater Mu’s “Fast Company.” Theater Mu returns to the Guthrie’s Level Nine to open its 2019/20 season with a play by Carla Ching (“The Two Kids That Blow Shit Up”). This time, she gives us a family of grifters and a story about dysfunction, destiny, perseverance and redemption. The award-winning play has been described as “savvy, sharp-fanged and entertaining.” Ming Montgomery, Eric “Pogi” Sumangil, Brian Kim and Jeannie Lander star; Brian Balcom is the director. In the Dowling Studio. FMI and tickets ($32-22; $9 on Nov. 8 and 13). Seating is general admission.
Sunday at Bethel University’s Benson Great Hall: Minnesota Youth Symphonies Annual Fall Concert. For this year’s offering, MYS will perform the North American premiere of “Mojito con saoco” by UNESCO Medal-winning composer Guido López-Gavilá, a work that had its world premiere in Cuba in May. MYS is co-directed by Minnesota Orchestra principal trumpet Manny Laureano and his wife, Claudette Laureano, who leads the string programs at Breck School. 2 p.m. Tickets here ($20-6).
Sunday at Magers & Quinn: Writing the YA Novel: A NaNoWriMo Panel with Shannon Gibney, Junauda Petrus and Andrew Karre. A terrific opportunity for anyone who writes YA novels, wants to write YA novels, or is curious about how YA novels happen. Karre is executive editor at Dutton Books for Young Readers. Gibney is the author of “Dream Country” and “See No Color,” Petrus is the author of “The Stars and the Blackness Between Them.” Both Gibney and Petrus live in Minneapolis. 5 p.m. NaNoWriMo is National Novel Writing Month, an annual internet-based creative writing project that takes place in November.

Where is the evangelical outrage over Trump’s prosperity gospel pastor?

Texto completo: Nearly 70% of white evangelical Protestants approve of Donald Trump’s performance as president, and Trump knows their support will be essential in 2020. He bragged before the 2018 midterm elections, “I hear we’re more popular than ever with the evangelicals.”
Paula White is one of them.
Trump’s personal pastor, White has long been informally in charge of Trump’s evangelical outreach. Now, it’s official.
The New York Times revealed last week that the televangelist has been tapped to join the president’s administration as an adviser for the Faith and Opportunity Initiative. She will be in charge of outreach to religious groups, seeking opinions on public policy issues through the Office of Public Liaison.
White’s hiring is clearly poised to cement Trump’s evangelical support. But White is not your typical Southern Baptist or nondenominational Protestant. A friend of Trump’s since 2002, White is a phony who preaches the gospel of self-aggrandizement and not much else.
Similar to her peers Joel Osteen, Benny Hinn, and Kenneth Copeland, she preaches something known as prosperity theology, which boils down to a belief that God is good for her wallet.
Rather than adhering to biblical teaching, she tells those who listen to her sermons that they will be rewarded for sending her money. And she promises “visions” from God for those who send her “ministry” more cash. “We aren’t buying a miracle,” she stresses. “We’re simply being obedient.” Right.
And just as Hinn and Copeland, White was investigated by the Senate Finance Committee in 2007 for misuse of funds.
Her theology and ethics may be iffy, but hey, she’s on the Trump train now. She has said that God told her to serve Trump: "To say 'no' to President Trump would be saying 'no' to God, and I won't do that."
At a Trump rally in her home state of Florida, she called any anti-Trump media demonic: “Right now, let every demonic network who has aligned itself against the purpose, against the calling of President Trump, let it be broken, let it be torn down in the name of Jesus!”
White has her supporters — more than 3 million just on her Facebook page — but when she recently released her book Something Greater, many evangelicals distanced themselves from her. The Babylon Bee, a Christian satire website, joined her detractors with the headline, “Satan endorses Paula White’s new book.”
Nevertheless, many high-profile leaders offered their support. Unsurprisingly, White has been endorsed by Liberty University’s Jerry Falwell Jr. and Franklin Graham, who only deleted a tweet supportive of her after getting considerable backlash.
Some evangelicals offered not an endorsement but a sigh of resignation.
“For those who do not share her theological disposition, it is wishful thinking to pretend that she is not a major force within American evangelicalism,” authors at Christianity Today wrote. “It is now Paula White-Cain’s world. The question is how we should live in it.”
White may preach a gospel that many evangelicals reject, but this won’t turn many of them off from Trump. They’ve already stuck with him this far, and he loves them because they love him.

White, now has a formal role in the administration with the Public Liaison office, which oversees outreach to constituent groups seen as key parts of the president’s base. The move giving the Florida-based, tele-evangelist an administration job is seen as another step to solidify his evangelical base as his re-election bid ramps up. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File)

‘Innocence is shattered:’ A storied Mormon family reels after Mexico murders

Texto completo: Queen Creek, Arizona • The message popped up on the family WhatsApp thread just after noon.
“Howie’s wife and four kids have been killed,” it said. “Christina and Donna and their kids are not accounted for. Were traveling with them.”
Aaron Staddon married into the diaspora of Mormon families who have long lived in the rural valleys of northern Mexico, and he shuddered when he read through the haunting thread of messages coming from south of the border.
“My heart just sank,” said Staddon, 44, who owns a swimming pool company outside of Phoenix. His wife, Leah Staddon, grew up in La Mora, where about 200 members of their extended family have built a thriving farming community in the Mexican state of Sonora. “This is the kind of nightmare that just floors you.”
The news, arriving Monday in a series of text messages, voice texts and short, horrifying videos, kept getting worse: More than a dozen members of their family had been attacked by gunmen in Mexico who had opened fire on their SUVs. By the time it was over, nine people were dead, and six others, including several children, were injured.
“Innocence is shattered right now,” said Joe Darger, another relative who quickly called an emergency family meeting at his home in Utah. “We don’t even know what to do about funerals.”
The extended family struck by Monday’s violence has long roots in the broader community of fundamentalist Mormons who first took up residence in Mexico’s northern border regions in the late 19th century.
Initially, the family’s patriarch was part of a wave of religious rebels who headed south to practice polygamy, once it was banned by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
Today, with descendants scattered across the American West, those living in La Mora are successful pecan, chile, alfalfa and pomegranate farmers, raising children who have dual American and Mexican citizenship. Only a few still practice plural marriage, but they continue to live as an observant religious community deep in some of Mexico’s most turbulent borderlands.
“It was a great place to raise kids,” said Staddon, describing how he and his wife would pack their five children into their SUV each year for the eight-hour drive from Phoenix to La Mora.
On Tuesday, several of the injured children were flown in for treatment at a hospital in Tucson, Arizona, and family members tried to piece together what had gone wrong. A photo quickly traveled from phone to phone: There was 8-year-old Cody Langford, one of the surviving children, on a hospital bed, his head swaddled in bandages, a thin shoulder peeking out from under a white blanket.
Then came a video showing the youngest survivor, 7-month-old Faith, shrieking as adults tried to comfort her.
The WhatsApp text that said “Christina and Donna” were unaccounted for was followed up with news that Christina Langford Johnson, 31, and Dawna Langford, 43, were among the dead.
“The whys we don’t know,” said Darger, growing emotional as he recounted the pain of waiting for news. “Did they specifically attack La Mora?”
Staddon said he had always been surprised at the contrast between the large homes that the Americans and their descendants had built in northern Mexico, and the poverty that surrounded them.
The American families got along well with their neighbors, he said. But the families’ location in the path of Mexico’s gun violence has cost them dearly in the past: Two family members were kidnapped and murdered by people believed to be drug cartel members in 2009.
More recently, Staddon said, family members have been facing new challenges, including the control of gasoline distribution by criminal gangs, which has made farming operations more difficult. Cartels in Mexico seem to be looking for new sources of revenue to make up for losses related to the legalization of marijuana in parts of the United States, he said.
Family members have begun returning to the United States. Some of them are no longer willing to adhere to the community’s strict religious practices, Staddon said, but many are also wary of the violence that is once again on the rise. Some families had recently traveled north to Arizona to scout out possible purchases of farmland.
“But an exodus takes a little time to organize,” Staddon said. “It’s tough to leave a place where your family’s invested so much.”
As the text and Facebook messages continued to flow in Tuesday, those who have returned to the United States, or never left, communicated almost nonstop over telephones and social media.
David Langford, 29, who grew up in La Mora but now lives in North Dakota, said his sister, Christina Maria Langford, was one of the women killed in Mexico. Those who committed the assaults were “ungodly,” he said, “some of the most wicked men on the face of the planet.”
A relative in Seattle, Amber Bostwick, said she was simply shocked.
“I would hope that this would bring about more safety from elected officials in both Mexico and America,” said Bostwick, 35, a homemaker whose biological father still lives part of the time in Mexico.
“Everybody’s on edge. Everybody’s suffering,” said Lynn Wariner LeBarón, a family member who works in Denver.
Long unaffiliated with the mainstream church, fundamentalist Mormon communities in northern Mexico originated in the late 1880s, when a number of families moved to the states of Chihuahua and Sonora. The settlers who put down stakes included Miles Park Romney, the great-grandfather of Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, and the party’s presidential nominee in 2012.
The families of La Mora are independents who broke off from the larger fundamentalist movement in the 1950s, though some share the same name as distant family members in the separate LeBarón community, said Lindsay Hansen Park, a historian who produces a podcast on the history of polygamy.
Over time, the communities have connected through marriage and intertwined families. Some families today are monogamous, and others practice plural marriage.
“They practice their own brand of Mormon theology,” she said. “They don’t follow a group or a leader.”
Three family branches make up the group — the Langfords, the Stubbs, and the LeBaróns — but the Langfords were the ones primarily victimized in Monday’s attack, she said.
The LeBarón community suffered decades of horrifying violence in past decades, some of which was caused by internal strife.
In the 1950s, Joel LeBarón had helped establish the community in northern Mexico in order to pursue a polygamous Mormon life, said Ruth Wariner, who was the 39th of 42 children Joel had with six wives. She now lives in Portland, Oregon, but maintains close contact with family members in Mexico.
But Joel’s brother, Ervil, split from the church to start his own following who believed in blood-atonement — in some cases violence — as punishment for sin, ultimately resulting in Joel’s killing, Wariner said. Ervil was suspected in a series of killings of rival religious leaders.
By the early 1990s, in the years after Ervil LeBarón died in prison, Wariner said things grew more peaceful until drug traffickers emerged as a new threat.
In more recent years, the LeBarón community had established a sort of truce with the cartels, Wariner said. They had an understanding, she said, that the community would not go after the traffickers if the traffickers left the community members alone. She said the killings were a surprise because there did not seem to be a cause for such an attack.
“Things seemed to be getting more peaceful,” Wariner said.
But one woman who asked not to be named out of fear for her safety said families traveling between the LeBarón and La Mora communities had been getting stopped lately by cartel members who asked where they were going and what they were doing.
They have generally been respectful, and did not seem to care about ordinary travel, the woman said.
But David Langford, who grew up in La Mora, said cartel members recently had been warning people to “stay off” the road between the La Mora and LeBarón communities at night.
“We did,” Langford said. It was a big change from the “peaceful” place that northern Mexico was when he grew up, he added.
“What just happened has never happened in this valley — ever,” he said. “We’ve been traveling that road for 50 years.”

Texto completo: El hijo mayor del presidente Donald Trump, tuiteó este miércoles el supuesto nombre del denunciante anónimo que reveló las presiones de su padre sobre Ucrania . La información que compartió Trump Jr. no ha sido corroborada y solo la han compartido pequeñas páginas web vinculadas a la extrema derecha.
La presunta identidad de quien reveló la información que desató el inicio del proceso para el juicio político al mandatario lleva semanas dando vueltas por la red . El propio mandatario ha pedido abiertamente a la prensa que revele el nombre, algo que va en contra de la leyes de protección al denunciante.
En su tuit, Trump Jr. enlazó un artículo de una publicación que sugería que el denunciante apoya a los demócratas y no a su padre. “ No hay denunciante. Hay alguien con intenciones ocultas contra Trump “, tuiteó el presidente el lunes.
Ese mismo día por la noche, en un acto en Kentucky, Trump y el senador republicano Rand Paul instaron a los medios a publicar la identidad del informante. “Nosotros también sabemos ahora el nombre del denunciante. Le dije esta noche a los medios: ‘hagan su trabajo y publiquen su nombre'” . Hasta ahora, según publicó The New York Times, solo se sabe que es un hombre que trabaja como agente de la CIA . The Times también adelantó que dicho agente tenía un amplio conocimiento de la política ucraniana .
La primera que publicó el supuesto nombre aseguró que su identidad había sido un secreto a voces en Washington. Andrew Bakaj, uno de los abogados del informante, no confirmó ni negó el nombre revelado a la agencia AFP y en un comunicado público dijo que “identificar cualquier nombre con el denunciante solo pondría en riesgo a esa persona y a su familia”.
Trump Jr. se ha desmarcado de los comentarios que le acusan de revelar una información que puede poner en peligro la vida del denunciante. El hijo del presidente se lava las manos asegurando que el nombre era público desde hace semanas.
The entire media is #Triggered that I (a private citizen) tweeted out a story naming the alleged whistleblower. Are they going to pretend that his name hasn’t been in the public domain for weeks now? Numerous people & news outlets including Real Clear Politics already ID’d him. https://t.co/bcamyTaXP3

Texto completo: Rep. Adam Schiff recently revealed that, before he entered politics, he wanted to be a screenwriter. He even penned scripts for a courtroom drama and an action-filled spy thriller. Mr. Schiff, now leading the Democratic push to impeach President Trump, hasn't lost his theatrical flair.
He insisted for months that there was "ample evidence of collusion in plain sight" before the Mueller report blew that claim to hell. Then there was Mr. Schiff's opening statement for the impeachment proceedings, in which he reimagined Mr. Trump's call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, presenting an alternate script. It was largely panned as a B-movie "Godfather" rip-off.
Now the would-be dramatist is staging a new production: "Impeaching the President." His script features secret sessions in the Capitol basement, anonymous whistleblowers, constant and selective leaks of testimony, and, of course, a brilliant performance by the heroic lead.
Count me as a skeptic, and not only because we know how this drama is likely to end: with an almost straight party-line vote by the House to impeach Mr. Trump and a near-straight party-line vote by the Senate not to remove him from office.
I'm also skeptical because I was cast in an earlier Schiff production, following my September 2007 departure as deputy White House chief of staff. On May 22, 2008, the House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed me to answer questions regarding the Bush administration's removal of nine U.S. attorneys starting in 2006 and the prosecution of Don Siegelman, a former Democratic governor of Alabama, who was convicted in 2006 of bribery and fraud and sentenced to seven years.
A New York Times editorial supported the Judiciary Committee's demand, speculating that I "may have been directly involved" in the "possibly illegal firings" of the U.S. attorneys and claiming Mr. Siegelman's prosecution "appears to have been politically motivated." Never mind that U.S. attorneys serve at the president's pleasure, that all nine were removed for cause, and that a career deputy U.S. attorney with an impeccable reputation led Mr. Siegelman's prosecution.
An Alabama lawyer named Dana Jill Simpson stoked Mr. Siegelman's complaints that I had railroaded him. On "60 Minutes" and MSNBC, she alleged I recruited her as an opposition researcher to take down Mr. Siegelman because he threatened the GOP's hold on the White House. This was absurd: I never met Ms. Simpson, the governor was never going to be president, and her claims on TV sounded unhinged because they were.
None of this mattered. As House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers explained, "We're closing in on Rove. Someone's got to kick his ass."
The subpoena raised issues of executive privilege and was stalemated until the Obama administration intervened to broker a compromise. So on July 7, 2009, I met with Judiciary Committee staff for a day of questioning. On July 30, I appeared for nearly 10 hours before Mr. Schiff, the committee's designated interrogator.
He hadn't even prepared. His staff gave him a large notebook full of questions, which he was evidently seeing for the first time. There were long pauses as he reviewed questions before asking them. He was repetitive, leading my lawyer to object frequently that I had already answered a question several times. Mr. Schiff barely touched the Siegelman issue and never raised Ms. Simpson's accusations. His staffers later admitted to me that they found her a completely unreliable witness.
Following my appearance, in the interest of transparency, I gave my emails and other documents to reporters. I didn't want to wait for Messrs. Schiff and Conyers to spin the information and "kick my ass." Predictably, they accused me of sidestepping an agreement not to discuss my testimony. I'd never made any such agreement.
Soon Mr. Schiff wrote a Huffington Post article to get in his shots. He claimed his interviews of former White House counsel Harriet Miers and me revealed that "the White House brought an unprecedented level of partisan pressure to bear" in the decision to fire the U.S. attorneys, and raised the question of "whether criminal charges are warranted."
No criminal charges were ever filed by the special prosecutor who investigated the matter, but Mr. Schiff enjoyed his moment in the cable-news sun, even though the Siegelman issue somehow disappeared.
Now Mr. Schiff probably hopes the public impeachment hearings will allow him to reprise Tom Cruise's role in "A Few Good Men" as Lt. Daniel Kaffee—"I want the truth!" But I know from experience that Mr. Schiff isn't much interested in the truth. He's more interested in drama, fiction and fame. His calm demeanor masks the heart of a fierce, untrustworthy partisan.

Elizabeth Warren's health care albatross

Texto completo: Between the collapse of George W. Bush's presidency and the rise of Donald Trump, the Republican Party was a more ideological institution than the Democratic Party. Both parties had litmus tests and orthodoxies, but the GOP had more of a "movement" spirit, reflecting the conservatism that had captured it, and ideological enforcers had more influence over its policy debates, more power to decree who counted as a "true conservative" and who was a "Republican in Name Only."
In this period Republican primary debates became more implausible and fairy tale-ish than their Democratic counterparts, with long-shot candidates competing to outdo one another in ideological zeal, and center-right politicians like John McCain and Mitt Romney trying awkwardly to adopt the language of activists to prove their bona fides.
Now something similar has happened to the Democrats. The party's leftward march began in Barack Obama's second term, and Hillary Clinton lost in 2016 in part because she abjured her husband's popular legacy of centrism, enabling Donald Trump to appear to many swing voters as the more moderate candidate in the race. Mirroring how tea partyers reacted to McCain's 2008 defeat, the Clinton debacle persuaded many liberals that a still-more-ideological party was needed, and the result has been a 2020 primary campaign as shaped by activist concerns as the GOP primary in 2012.
The perils of becoming an ideological party are often framed in terms of culture-war issues, with Beto O'Rourke's promises to seize guns and tax churchesthe liberal equivalent of Michele Bachmann's crusading zeal. But ultimately ideological enforcement hurt McCain and Romney much more on pocketbook issues, health care and taxes especially, where under conservative pressure, they ended up staking out positions that became anchors on their general-election campaigns.
That is the danger facing the Democrats, and particularly their quasi-front-runner Elizabeth Warren, with the issue of "Medicare for All." Single-payer health care is, in certain ways, the liberal-activist equivalent of the conservative dream of a flat tax. It's an idea of some merit if you're designing a system from scratch, and it polls OK if you don't tell people about the trade-offs. But it tends to run into trouble quickly on the state level . And it has enough political vulnerabilities, in terms of costs and disruption both, that no sane Democrat should want it as the centerpiece of their national campaign.
Warren, who is definitely sane, clearly doesn't want to make it her centerpiece; you can tell that she'd like to run on her promise to tax the wealthy to pay for free child care and college, with a dose of anti-corruption and trustbusting on the side. These ideas have their own difficulties, but they're popular and responsive to the voters, and a good foil for Trump's record of corporate tax cuts and not much else.
But being a progressive candidate in a leftward-marching party required her to sign on to Medicare for All, and being the "I've got a plan for that" candidate in a party that still fetishizes wonkery required her to roll out a big, multitrillion-dollar proposal Friday. (Kamala Harris, the Tim Pawlenty of 2020, attempted Medicare for All evasiveness and fell off the map.) So now if Warren wins the nomination, she's going to drag a multitrillion-dollar renovation of the U.S. health care system into the fall campaign - even though everyone understands that the renovation won't happen, even though Warren herself would rather talk about other policies that poll better. An ideological party is a harsh mistress.
Of course, Team Warren and its many adjuncts in the press will argue that one, this is the primary campaign and there's time to pivot toward the center, and two, that Warren's plan is superclever in its avoidance of overt middle-class taxation.
The second point seems weak to me; the potent fear of health insurance disruption will suffice to make Medicare for All a liability, even if Warren isn't waving a specific list of middle-class tax hikes, and her slippery health care math could reflect badly on all her other, more popular proposals.
The former claim, meanwhile, is one that Teams Romney and McCain often made in their campaigns; recall the Romney adviser who explained how they would simply shake the Etch A Sketch when the general election rolled around. But it's rarely that easy because your opponent gets a chance to set the terms of the debate - which is why Romney's primary season plan was savaged as a middle-class tax hike, despite all his attempted pivots, deep into the fall of 2012.
What makes Warren different from Romney, of course, is that she has many more media adjuncts willing to give her math the benefit of the doubt, and also she's running against Trump. Highly ideological parties and candidates can win elections in the right circumstances, and a race against an unpopular, unfit and impeachable incumbent might be one of them.
But it would still be a folly, a case study in ideology's exacting costs, for the Democrats to take the chance.

Texto completo: A police investigation in Coral Springs, Fla., faulted a 911 call supervisor who was apparently watching a movie when a woman called in for help after a shooting.
When a bullet punched through her car's rear windshield and narrowly missed hitting her in the head, Guadalupe Herrera called 911. Then she waited. And waited. In the end, it took half an hour for the dispatchers to send a Coral Springs, Fla., police officer to the scene. By that time Ms. Herrera had driven herself to a police station.
Part of the reason for the delay has now been revealed by an internal disciplinary report: A 911 supervisor was not paying close attention to the calls coming in.
Instead, it appears she was watching Netflix. Specifically, the dystopian science-fiction movie "I Am Mother," starring Hilary Swank. It had debuted on the streaming video site two days earlier.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The timeline of the botched response to the June shooting and the supervisor's online media habits were detailed in an investigation released by the Coral Springs Police Department, and earlier reported this week by The South Florida Sun Sentinel.
In Coral Springs, a city near Fort Lauderdale, the Police Department's communications center is a busy place. The department employs 220 officers and 100 civilians, and serves a population of about 127,000 residents.
"There's a lot of stations in the same room," said Sgt. Carla Kmiotek, a police spokeswoman. "They have dispatchers, call-takers, the person who runs the fire channel, the police channel, and our information channel all together."
Supervisors are in the room, too. According to Sergeant Kmiotek, between six and eight employees are working eight-hour shifts at any given time. Most of them are wearing headphones, so a supervisor might not overhear the conversation with a 911 caller.
On June 9, Julie Vidaud was the supervisor on duty when Ms. Herrera called in just before 7 p.m. The person who took that call logged it improperly as "suspicious activity" instead of as a "shooting." At 7:13 p.m., Ms. Herrera called 911 again and said she "got shot at in the car"; she was told an officer would be there as soon as one was available.
Four minutes later, Ms. Herrera called 911 a third time to inform the police that she was going to drive to the nearest police station. A final call to 911 came in at 7:29 p.m. from Ms. Herrera's sister, to let the police know that Ms. Herrera had arrived.
Ms. Vidaud later agreed with a police investigator that the 911 response had been a "catastrophic failure," and said that "I failed at that particular call and I hate that." Once she was aware of the slow response, Ms. Vidaud said, she "did everything that I was supposed to do."
Despite the delay in dispatching help, a suspect in the shooting has since been arrested.
Attempts to reach Ms. Vidaud on Tuesday were not successful. A 2018 article in The Sun Sentinel noted that as a police dispatcher she had assisted victims of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas school shooting.
The disciplinary investigation revealed that Ms. Vidaud had been streaming movies and TV shows while sitting at her station over the previous month -- nearly 10 hours' worth of Netflix, Hulu and Xfinity combined. Ms. Vidaud told an investigator that, though the Netflix movie was playing on one of her screens when the 911 calls came in, she would not have been watching the film then.
Until recently, though, Coral Springs employees were not prohibited from streaming online media while on the job. And there is no nationwide standard for supervising 911 call centers.
"While supervision is important," said Harriet Rennie-Brown, a former president of the National Association of State 911 Administrators, "those are decisions that are made at the local 911 center based on their demographics and operational needs."
Ms. Rennie-Brown, who has 25 years of experience as a 911 dispatcher and supervisor, said there were nearly 5,800 such call centers across the country, all operating under various standards.
Ms. Vidaud was monitoring five screens at the time Ms. Herrera's calls came in, according to the investigation. At least one screen was quite likely for monitoring something called "computer aided dispatch," which assists emergency workers in sharing information and getting firefighters, police officers and other responders to a given location.
Netflix will no longer appear on those screens; streaming sites like it are now prohibited under a change in department policy.
According to a police statement issued Monday, an employee who took the 911 calls was fired, and a second employee was disciplined and then fired.
Though the department recommended that Ms. Vidaud serve a two-day suspension without pay, her punishment has yet to be approved by the police chief.

Should you hire a doula?

Texto completo: Numerous studies have shown that women who receive continuous support in labor from a doula have decreased rates of C sections
and give birth
to healthier babies.
When you're pregnant, joy and anxiety often intertwine.
Unfortunately, fears about something going wrong are not entirely unfounded. New Jersey ranks fifth highest in maternal mortality rates, based on data from 46 states analyzed in a USA TODAY investigation in 2018. That means that out of every 100,000 births in New Jersey, 37 moms die.
The United States, which has the highest maternal death rate among developed countries, is one of only three nations – the others are Afghanistan and Sudan – where the maternal mortality rate is rising, according to the Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health, an organization aimed at reducing harm to women in health care.
To address these problems, First Lady Tammy Murphy has established Nurture NJ, an awareness campaign committed to reducing infant and maternal mortality and morbidity and ensuring equitable maternal and infant care among women and children of all races and ethnicities.
"The color of your skin," Tammy Murphy said in a video on the website of the office of the governor, "should not impact the quality of the care you get or your chances of surviving maternity or surviving your first year of birth."
How do you continue to tamp down all those concerns? With education. With assertiveness. With help from people you trust.
And, perhaps, with help from a doula.
What is a doula? A doula's job is to help pregnant women navigate the nine months that lead to motherhood.
A bill that passed in the New Jersey state Assembly in March aims to improve access to doula services by expanding Medicaid coverage, but federal approval is needed before the bill can have any lasting impact.
Doulas provide non-medical assistance to women during pregnancy, childbirth and the post-partum period. Sometimes known as "birth sisters," doulas serve as coaches and all-around helpers to the pregnant woman and her birth partner.
They can perform acupressure and other comfort measures during labor. They give encouragement to a laboring woman and her partner. They are trained professionals who give continuous physical and emotional support, as well as up-to-date, evidence-based research and information.
"We don't take away anything from the doctor," said Angela Turner, a doula with Community Doulas of South Jersey in Camden. "We work with the mothers, in pre-natal care, asking them, 'What plans do you have? What kind of birth do you want?' with the understanding that birth is unpredictable."
Turner recalled the labor experience of a client whose goal was to have a fully natural childbirth. At 41 weeks of pregnancy, however, she agreed to be induced, but, with the backing of Turner as her doula, she was still able to remain in control of the process.
"She requested female doctors and staff. She wanted lights off," Turner said. "She wanted family members in the room, and she wanted to be able to move around. She wanted time to herself for prayer, with nobody in the room."
"Her doctors were on board with what she wanted," Turner said. "They just waited and watched, as her body did what it was supposed to do. And she had a wonderful childbirth experience."
An ancient practice In some cultures, relatives routinely serve as unofficial doulas, with mothers, grandmothers or aunts helping women as they give birth.
"My family is from the Dominican Republic," said Cristina Ramos, a doula based in the Somerset section of Franklin. "My oldest aunt has been attending family births for 50 years, beginning at age 18. She was a lay doula."
Later, after Ramos became a mother, she, too, took up that role for her extended family.
When Ramos learned that a friend was training to become a professional doula through Doulas Of North America (DONA), she said to herself, "That's pretty much what I do," and switched from a career in sales to one as a doula.
Ronsha Dickerson, director of Community Doulas of South Jersey, says the presence of a doula in a hospital's labor and delivery ward serves to validate and empower pregnant women.
"Our goal is that moms feel they have value in that room," Dickerson said.
Hill knows first hand the difference that extra cheerleader can make. She has four daughters, and each birth was different. Hill's mother accompanied her for the first birth, and she credits her mom's company with helping her make it through labor unmedicated.
"For the second one, my mom got caught in traffic," Hill said. "I noticed a difference right away. It was a horrible experience."
Hilll's third and fourth child were born by C section, so she did not labor.
"Doulas provide continuity of care," Ramos said. "It doesn't matter how long it takes, I will be there for the entire birth."
Meeting moms' needs Most importantly, doulas serve as advocates. They make sure that a pregnant woman's needs are met and her wishes are respected.
Ramos said she asks many questions of prospective clients: "What kind of birth do you want?" "What forms of intervention do you want or not want?" And one that may come as a surprise: "Are you confident that your provider is looking out for your best interests?"
Ramos advises clients to shop around for a doctor or midwife, hospital or birthing center, until they find what feels right.
Advocacy can be especially important for women of color.
As reported in June by the USA TODAY Network, the overwhelming majority of women who die or suffer catastrophic injury in birth or post-delivery are African-American women.
Why does this happen? Doulas say the answer is very simple. "People in the medical field," Ramos said, "they just don't listen."
New Jersey Assemblywoman Shavonda Sumter told a reporter for lohud.com that New Jersey Health Commissioner Shereef Elnahal "hit the nail on the head" when he said, "It's implicit bias."
The phenomenon of "weathering," or the toll that is exacted on African-American women's bodies from the grinding stress of systemic racism, was examined in an influential 2018 article in the New York Times Magazine by Linda Villarosa. "Weathering" cuts across class, education and income levels, and lifestyle factors.
Alynson Sloan-Anderson, a doula with Community Doulas of South Jersey, said the support of a doula can mitigate some of that bone-deep stress that African-American women carry.
"It's important because it empowers black and brown women who have traditionally been underrepresented and overlooked," Sloan-Anderson said. "There's a level of trust that needs to be built up, to where they can say, 'I trust you to come into my home,' and we go in with a non-judgmental attitude, and help them use their voices and advocate for themselves to ensure their health and the health of their babies."
"I have always had women of color in my client base," Ramos said, "but I am hearing from more African-American women professionals who are reaching out in fear. I ask them, 'Why do you want a doula?' and they say, 'I am going to die. My cousin almost died. No one listened to her and she was hemorrhaging.' We have to get them to let go of the fear."
"We need an intervention," Hill said, "because doctors aren't listening, not hearing, they're just going by the book. Not everyone's body is the same."
Expanding access to doulas Under the umbrella of Nurture NJ, the state Department of Health's "Healthy Women, Healthy Families" program has provided funding for partners to hire 77 outreach workers – 40 doulas, 29 community health workers and eight community health worker supervisors – to improve the health of African-American women.
Numerous studies have shown that women who receive continuous support in labor from a doula have decreased rates of C sections
and give birth
to healthier babies.

Texto completo: It shouldn't surprise anyone that businesses use "secret" scores to grade consumers on a variety of factors, including creditworthiness and likelihood of declaring bankruptcy.
It's been known for years that such scores exist. The New York Times highlighted the practice Monday with a look at one person's score.
But the more insidious part of the equation is the largely unregulated industry of data brokers that make billions of dollars annually buying and selling people's personal information -- your information, not to put too fine a point on it.

Without these companies, there'd be no secret scores. They are the root of the problem.
"We have an entire data-collecting, data-sharing industry operating in the shadows," said Dylan Gilbert, policy counsel for the advocacy group Public Knowledge. "The average consumer has no idea these companies even exist, let alone what their names might be."
This is a big deal. As Harry Potter learned with his invisibility cloak, you can get up to all manner of mischief if no one can see you.
"If people have no idea what's happening with their data," Gilbert told me, "they have no way of truly protecting their privacy."
That may finally be changing.
California Gov. Gavin Newsom last month signed into law a bill -- AB 1202 -- that requires data brokers to register with the state attorney general. Their names and contact information for the first time will be available to the public.
The data broker directory is among California's sweeping privacy safeguards that take effect Jan. 1. Only one other state, Vermont, has similarly shined a light on data brokers.
At the federal level, lawmakers are considering the Data Broker List Act, which would create a national registry overseen by the Federal Trade Commission.
The bill has bipartisan backing. It was introduced by Sen. Gary Peters, a Michigan Democrat, and Sen. Martha McSally, an Arizona Republican.
However, Gilbert at Public Knowledge said he doesn't expect the legislation to get anywhere amid the current focus on impeachment proceedings. Moreover, many privacy experts say the legislation doesn't go far enough.
Michael Zimmer, an associate professor of computer science at Marquette University, called the federal bill "helpful but woefully inadequate."
"Consumers really need meaningful regulation of data brokers," he said. "They need the ability to access and correct their profiles, to limit how they may be used ... or to opt out completely."
The danger of not knowing what's behind the industry's invisibility cloak was a theme that came up repeatedly in my conversations with privacy experts.
"The more data a company has on you, the more they are able to create a complete digital picture of who you are, and exploit that in a variety of means," said Jordan Fischer, a law professor at Drexel University.
The data broker industry is believed to be worth about $200 billion. Some of the biggest players are known to all, such as the credit bureaus Experian, Equifax and TransUnion, which maintain files on millions of Americans.
Others are smaller, quieter firms that specialize in gathering people's personal information from public and private sources, and making it available to other companies for marketing, employment, financial and other purposes.
"Creating a list of data brokers is a first step in helping consumers know who these actors are, but that does nothing to constrain their practices," said Jen King, director of privacy at Stanford Law School's Center for Internet and Society.
California's new privacy law will allow consumers to instruct companies to delete their personal information and to opt out of having their information shared.
That means you'll be able to contact your phone or cable company, say, and tell them to no longer make your personal info available to others. The law applies to any company doing business in the state.
Privacy experts I spoke with said it's unclear at this point whether you'd be able to contact every firm listed on the state's pending directory of data brokers and similarly tell them to knock it off.
For example, the privacy law says consumers can opt out of having their data shared by companies with third parties. But what if that company got its information about you from elsewhere? Is there still a third party if the first party (you) isn't part of the picture?
"I'd say you could still opt out," said Paul Schwartz, co-director of UC Berkeley's Center for Law and Technology. "But there's a little ambiguity."
Even if you could, the onus would be on consumers to contact potentially hundreds of data brokers and opt out from each one individually -- a task few people would have the time or patience to embark upon.
Moreover, how would you know if they've honored your opt-out request?
I went through California's privacy law and couldn't find any language addressing this question, other than a provision in Section 1798.135 that a business must "respect the consumer's decision to opt out for at least 12 months" before seeking permission to resume data sharing.
Zimmer at Marquette University likened California's and Vermont's data broker directories to the federal "do not call" list -- a well-intended idea that never lived up to its purpose.
The do-not-call list is a resource that "just about every telemarketer has figured out how to get around, let alone simply ignore," he said.
Data brokers haven't exactly earned the public's trust. In June, the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs held a hearing on how the industry operates.
Not one data broker showed up.
The solution is clearly to use an opt-in approach rather than opt-out.
That is, requiring businesses to seek permission upfront before they can share data.
Unfortunately, we're nowhere close to a law that so boldly, and explicitly, places consumer interests ahead of those of businesses.
"Having a list of data brokers is better than not having a list," said William McGeveran, a law professor at the University of Minnesota. "But it's still far short of accountability."

Texto completo: The new leader of America's largest police force is a 28-year department veteran who started as a beat officer in the Bronx.
Dermot F. Shea, the Police Department's chief of detectives and next commissioner, began his career with America's largest police force in an era when New York was much more violent than it is today.
In 1991, the year Chief Shea joined the department as an officer in the 46th Precinct in the Bronx, the city recorded more than 2,000 murders. Last year, there were 289.
The sharp drop in murders, and in crime generally, in those 28 years has coincided with the department's use of the data-driven, anti-crime Compstat management program.
Chief Shea's career is in some ways closely linked to Compstat. The system was introduced roughly around the time he began patrolling a beat. He was a protégé of its original champion, Commissioner William J. Bratton. And he oversaw the program in the job he held for four years before he was named chief of detectives in April 2018.
In announcing the new commissioner, Mayor Bill de Blasio cited the breadth of Chief Shea's experience as the reason he was "uniquely qualified" to push New York's already historically low crime rate down even further.
[Read more about the legacy of the outgoing commissioner, James P. O'Neill .]
Chief Shea, the mayor said, was "a proven change agent, using precision policing to fight crime and build trust between police and communities."
In addition to his time on patrol in the Bronx, Chief Shea, 50, commanded two precincts in the borough and did tours in Manhattan and Queens, working at various times in narcotics, investigations and plainclothes units.
He took on responsibility for Compstat in 2014 when he was named chief of crime-control strategies and deputy commissioner for operations. He was then installed in his current job, overseeing all criminal investigations.
At a news conference on Monday, Chief Shea, a son of working-class Irish immigrants who grew up in a cramped apartment in Sunnyside, Queens, recalled his early days as an officer in the 46th Precinct fondly. He had joined the department along with his brother and cousin.
"There was nothing better than walking out and just talking to people as you would interact with them day in and day out," he said.
Chief Shea pledged to build on the work of his predecessor, Commissioner James P. O'Neill, when he takes over the top job on Dec. 1. He also said he would prioritize taking down gangs and getting guns off the streets.
Patrick J. Lynch, the president of the Police Benevolent Association, a union, welcomed Chief Shea's appointment, describing it as a hopeful sign for rank-and-file officers, who Mr. Lynch says are in need of support from the top.
"We look forward to working with Commissioner Shea to combat the current anti-police atmosphere and make positive changes that will improve the lives of our police officers and every New Yorker we protect," Mr. Lynch said.
Critics of the department were less enthusiastic.
Councilman Donovan Richards, a Queens Democrat who leads the Council's Committee on Public Safety, described the incoming commissioner as a "personable individual whose heart is in the right place."
But Mr. Richards said that Chief Shea's appointment was a "missed opportunity to really diversify the top office" of the Police Department.
Mr. Richards also said that Chief Shea had seemed unwilling to seriously consider complaints about contentious issues like the department's gang database, where, critics say, names can land too easily and stay for too long.
"At this moment, I'm not convinced he's going to be more aggressive in pushing reforms," Mr. Richards said.
Tina Luongo, attorney-in-charge of the criminal defense practice at the Legal Aid Society, also cited what she called the "rogue" gang database as a reason she was skeptical about Chief Shea's appetite for change.
"This will be more of the same, and our clients -- New Yorkers from communities of color -- will continue to suffer more of the same from a police department that prioritizes arrests and summonses above all else," she said.
Darius Charney, a lawyer for the plaintiffs in the litigation that curbed the Police Department's stop-and-frisk policy, offered Chief Shea a three-item to-do list.
To gain the trust of those pushing for police reforms, Mr. Charney said, the new commissioner would need to act on the recommendations of an independent panel that reviewed the department's approach to disciplining officers; address officers' underreporting of street stops and searches; and uphold a vow to release body camera footage from major incidents like police shootings.
"We hope that he will really show us in deed and word a commitment to these issues," Mr. Charney said.
Chief Shea also faces continuing criticism over the department's handling of sex crimes.
As chief of detectives, he oversaw a revamping of the Special Victims Division after a city report said neglect by top officials had created systemic problems in the unit.
But several rape victims and their advocates said the Police Department had failed to sufficiently address persistent problems like inadequate staffing that prevented cases from being properly investigated.
Some critics have called for an independent monitor to take control of the division. Chief Shea defended his work to change the division and said he planned to meet with victims' advocates next week.
Michael Gold and Ashley Southall contributed reporting.

Texto completo: On his first tour since admitting misconduct, the comedian's theme was the cathartic release of transgression as he delivered bits about his mother's death and religion.
RICHMOND, Va. -- On Saturday, under a candy-colored proscenium arch, Louis C.K. told a story about the day he learned "all the bad words." He was 7 when an elderly stranger with one dark tooth approached him and listed obscenities like a fairy-tale version of George Carlin.
Louis C.K. described vibrating with excitement. Then he went to school and put this information to work, cursing at his teacher. She cried and the students laughed. "I liked both," he said, with a half-embarrassed shrug.
In the context of the return of Louis C.K., this anecdote has the feel of a twisted origin story. And this defiantly perverse new set, whose jokes come with so much baggage they threaten to obscure the performer, will inspire heated, divisive reactions.
It's been two years since The New York Times published an article about the sexual misconduct of Louis C.K., which he subsequently confirmed. He said he would "step back and take a long time to listen," then returned to clubs nine months later, performing intermittently. Last weekend, he began a new phase in his comeback, a theater tour starting with two shows in Richmond, Va., on Saturday and taking him across the world.
Returning to his old uniform of blue jeans and black shirt, he began both shows with oblique jokes about his pariah status. He didn't so much play the sad sack as the guy strenuously trying to put a happy face on what a sad sack he is. "It's good to start over at 52," he said with a strained smile. "So much energy."
Those looking for any apologetic notes or reckoning with the damage he has done will be disappointed. He is not aiming for redemption onstage. If anything, he's doubling down on the comedic value of saying the wrong thing. "That's the point of this," he said, motioning to himself onstage. He didn't repeat the now cliché comedian complaints about generational sensitivities or snowflakes, but the central theme of the night was the cathartic release of transgression.
His subjects (Sept. 11, slavery, pedophilia, the Holocaust) made the case. He turned his new reputation in the #MeToo era into a springboard for jokes. "Wait until they find those pictures of me in blackface," he said. The audience, which gave him standing ovations, roared. Then he pushed further, saying he has done blackface for years. "I didn't do it to be funny," he added. "I liked it. Felt good. I do it for bedtime."
Comedy criticism is never objective, but there is nothing more subjective than how funny you find Louis C.K. in 2019. That's what makes writing this review difficult, and being transparent about my point of view necessary. Over the past decade, no comic had a greater impact on me than Louis C.K. While my relationship with his old work has changed -- I can't laugh at his rape jokes anymore, and the story lines on his FX show that touched on assault now seem like obscene rationalizations -- I still regularly think about Louis C.K. punch lines and chuckle.
His jokes about technology and parenting are so lodged in my subconscious that no amount of cultural shame can remove them. And while I agree with the critics who have rejected the idea that we must separate the art from the artist, I have a high tolerance for enjoying art from morally suspect places.
Given that, Louis C.K.'s new show made me laugh very hard. It's also uncomfortable in ways he seems in control of and ways he does not. It has a few characteristically ingenious riffs, particularly about religion: one imagining if God gave a quick, explanatory news conference ("Mormons, no.") and another picturing the God of jihadis on his way to gather the 72 virgins for a suicide bomber, rubbing his head in confusion at how he got here. And Louis C.K. remains exceptionally skilled at body-horror comedy (likening his chest to the ceiling of a cave) and herky-jerky pivots that blend the sexual and the profane.
In the most jarring part of the show, he discussed the death of his mother in June in a remarkably unsentimental aside. Interrupting a mundane story about visiting a cemetery with his French girlfriend, he detoured into the details of his mother's cremation (mixing in a few sex jokes for good measure).
"She was a practical woman who didn't care about the pageantry of death," he said, before describing her body being taken away in a gray van, a half-filled Gatorade bottle rattling around with her. In the past, Louis C.K. has questioned the value of life, mocking its sanctity and downplaying its importance, but this grim image goes just as far in undercutting the solemnity of death.
Last December, one of his early post-return club sets leaked online and several of the jokes, including a particularly nasty one about the Parkland students, earned widespread condemnation. He has cut that joke and a few other controversial ones -- though he has a dopey new punch line comparing vegans to gay people that seems intended to bait. His stage show is leaner than that December set, more deliberate, with fewer attempts at ingratiation. (There's no talk of the millions of dollars he lost when his show-business deals were canceled.)
After hearing that rough draft of a set, many concluded that Louis C.K. had rebranded himself a cranky right-wing comic. And there was (and is) a new edge to his comedy that bristles at offense taken easily. There's a lame joke about cultural appropriation. But the truth is that the comedy of Louis C.K. hasn't changed as much as the context surrounding it.
Louis C.K. has long found humor in following the logic of immoral thoughts, while somehow not just keeping the audience on his side, but convincing them of an enlightened intent. It's partly why people were not just disturbed by his behavior, they felt betrayed. He did sharp, empathetic material about the hurt of gay slurs. He told jokes about rape and violence against women that were considered feminist. It's hard to remember, but there was a time not long ago when no comic got the benefit of the doubt more than Louis C.K.
That is ancient history now. And context, as people always say when defending an offensive joke, matters. We know too much about his transgressions to see jokes that transgress in the same way.
Instead of adjusting, or offering a more reflective, soul-searching show, as some had hoped, Louis C.K. has stuck to his old tactics. And as such, some of his jokes will fall flat with a huge part of his former audience and will strike others as blows against political correctness.
His premise about how women have the skill to seem O.K. when they aren't won't play the same way as it did two years ago. He clearly knows this.
Toward the end of each show on Saturday, he returned to the subject of his mother as he wondered about her sex life, concluding, "You never really know your mom." You got the distinct sense he was jealous of her on that count.

Texto completo: Readers both praise her plan as a huge advance in American health care and criticize it as unachievable.
To the Editor:
Re "Warren Unveils Medicare for All at $ 20.5 Trillion" (front page, Nov. 2):
Hooray for Senator Elizabeth Warren's health plan. If adopted, every citizen, finally, would have health insurance, and America's astronomical medical costs would be arrested. A political blunder? Not once the senator's public education campaign takes hold and puts into play information such as this:
Among the wealthy nations the United States has higher infant mortality rates and lower longevity rates despite spending as much as double or more on health care. Several studies estimate the inefficiencies in America's $ 3.5 trillion bloated system to be as much as a third or more.
Citizens in other rich countries don't file for bankruptcy because of medical costs -- the leading cause of bankruptcy in the United States. The elimination of jobs when private insurance companies disappear could be offset by training displaced workers to enter the climate change battle. And, finally, no country anywhere is looking to adopt the American model.
Thank you, Senator Warren, for your specifics on funding health care for all. Now let's hear similar specifics from the other candidates.

To the Editor:
I was glad to see details of Elizabeth Warren's plan to finance Medicare for all, but her position will undermine her candidacy in a general election. Support for Medicare for all is wavering, especially when people are asked if they are willing to give up their private insurance, and support for a public option is growing. I urge Senator Warren to release a statement along these lines:
"I believe that universal health care is a human right, and that Medicare for all is the best way of achieving that laudable goal. However, after listening to thousands of people at town halls and elsewhere, I am persuaded that an incremental approach is what will best serve the needs of the American people. I will, therefore, support a plan that allows people to choose private insurance policies or join Medicare. I believe that over time the majority of Americans will choose Medicare and we will achieve Medicare for all, but this incremental approach will be less disruptive in the short term and preserve the freedom of choice that is at the core of the American spirit."
By doing so, Senator Warren would adopt a position that would garner broader support among the electorate and demonstrate that she is capable of listening and modifying her positions when necessary. That is the mark of a true leader.

To the Editor:
Your article focuses too much on the negative responses to Senator Elizabeth Warren's proposal for Medicare for all: It would be too expensive; it would be too progressive and even radical; it would hurt her politically; it would prevent her from beating Donald Trump; it would never get through Congress and be enacted.
Isn't it exciting, finally, in 2019, that the United States might provide health care for all Americans, whether rich or poor, employed or not? As a physician who has treated thousands of underinsured and uninsured patients, I find the prospect of all of us having health insurance to verge on the miraculous! Please share my delight.
David H. Lehman

To the Editor:
What a shock to see the cost of Elizabeth Warren's plan for Medicare for all. This kind of cost is what is needed for our climate emergency, not Medicare. Ask millennials and members of Generation Z. They would agree. As a climate activist, I know we cannot afford to lose sight of this necessary goal.

A Canceled Kanye Begins a Hymn

Texto completo: Kanye West has had it with "cancel culture." He's sick of the woke mobs that take people down for what they deem transgressions. "I've been canceled," the hip-hop artist told a Los Angeles radio station this month. "I've been canceled before they had cancel culture." His sins include sporting a MAGA hat and disparaging Taylor Swift, but also, more seriously, calling slavery a "choice" and chanting misogynistic lyrics.
Kanye isn't excusing his behavior, but he announced that he converted to Christianity and has started hosting gospel-music "Sunday Services." Woke folks see it as a transactional trick. "These performances have helped grant Mr. West a certain grace that . . . has not been afforded to artists who have been maligned for similar sins of a smaller scale," Shamira Ibrahim writes in the New York Times.
Whatever the state of his soul, Kanye has revealed something important: Cancel culture doesn't understand redemption. There's no hope for the canceled but to avoid further cancellation, which requires capitulation to the canceling furies. Witness Laurence Fink, the BlackRock CEO who's in trouble with progressives for the companies he invests in. He's hoping his past acts of social responsibility will cover his sins, but it's not working. Student activist Kyle Kashuv apologized for bigoted remarks he made at 16, but Harvard still pulled his admission offer. When an Iowa security guard stumbled into money and gave it to a children's hospital, a local reporter dug up and published two racist tweets from seven years ago. Canceled.
Some are immune. Bill Clinton is only mildly canceled; Al Franken is toast. Many canceled people have committed wrongs for which it's fair to expect an apology or resignation. But woke culture is bitter. It demands penance but doesn't forgive, encouraging cynicism more than uprightness.
Kanye appears to have adopted a more demanding code of conduct. His pastor says Kanye no longer swears, and he reportedly asked people working for him to abstain from premarital sex. He sings about the value of family and prayer, and in interviews he remarks on the evils of porn.
Paradoxically, this stricter code makes him freer than woke rules would. His newest album, "Jesus Is King," is a joyous tribute to deliverance. Lines include "He saved a wretch like me" and "I know God is the force that picked me up." A gospel choir sings "hallelujah" almost shrilly, like someone so relieved he can only scream. Unlike the woke mob, Christianity understands that everyone sins -- but it offers unmerited grace.
Kanye's Christian turn prompts reflection on the way in which we condemn misdeeds. In Dostoevsky's "The Brothers Karamazov," one of the brothers, Dmitri, looks up to God even as he laments his own base sensuality: "When I fall into the abyss, I go straight into it, head down and heels up. . . . And so in that very shame I suddenly begin a hymn," he says.
Kanye is likewise singing a hymn. Music aesthetes can debate the merits of "Jesus Is King," but grace is a sweet sound to those who know they need it.

Texto completo: BY THOMAS BEAUMONT, BILL BARROW and WILL WEISSERT
The Associated Press
DES MOINES, Iowa - The leading Democrats vying for their party's presidential nomination clashed over the critical issue of health care while offering starkly contrasting visions for the nation's ideological direction before thousands of cheering Iowa activists at a raucous event kicking off the three-month sprint to the first-in-the-nation caucuses.
Former Vice President Joe Biden opened the state Democratic Party's marquee annual fundraiser, the Liberty and Justice Celebration, by swiping at the candidate who has largely caught him atop the Democratic primary polls, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Meanwhile, Pete Buttigieg, the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Ind., pledged generational change, trying to take up the mantle of another young, upstart candidate, Barack Obama, who pulled off a 2008 upset in Iowa on his way to the presidency.
The jabs were relatively gentle but previewed arguments that are likely to increasingly dominate the race.
Biden said he would overhaul health care nationwide without "increases in taxes for the middle class. None. None. None." While not mentioning Warren by name, his pronouncement came hours after she unveiled a much-anticipated proposal to spend $20-plus trillion over the next decade on a "Medicare for All" universal health care plan that she vowed wouldn't require a middle-class tax increase. Biden's campaign had already panned that as requiring "mathematic gymnastics" to cover its huge costs.
The former vice president has promised not to "abandon" Obama's signature health care law. The issue has created a stark policy divide between Warren and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, both of whom back Medicare for All, and more moderate candidates like Biden and Buttigieg, who say the country isn't ready to do away with private insurance.
Taking the stage a short time later, Warren made an unwavering appeal for sweeping change, saying, "If the most we can promise is business as usual after Donald Trump, then we will lose."
"It's easy to give up on a big idea, but when we give up on a big idea, we give up on the people whose lives would be touched by that big idea," she said. "Anyone who comes on this stage and tells you to dream small and give up early is not going to lead our party to victory."
In all, more than a dozen presidential candidates addressed 13,000-plus Democratic activists, party volunteers and campaign supporters at a basketball arena in downtown Des Moines. The event amounts to the largest gathering of Democrats in an early voting state - and was something of a dress rehearsal for the Feb. 3 caucuses.
For White House hopefuls in the top tier, the event was a key test of momentum, while lagging contenders will face further questions about why they're staying in the race. That was on full display even before Friday's festivities began, with former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke abruptly announcing he was abandoning his campaign.
Like Biden, Buttigieg didn't mention Warren by name but said he supported "Medicare for all who want it" and promised to honor the decisions of those who aren't willing to sign up for fully government-sponsored health care. The 37-year-old also offered a veiled swipe at Warren, Biden and Sanders - all in their 70s - by chiding candidates for being content to "wait for action."
"I am running to be the president who will stand amid the rubble, pick up the pieces of our divided nation and lead us to real action to do right by Americans who have waited far too long," Buttigieg said.
A New York Times/Siena College poll of likely caucusgoers released Friday found Warren, Sanders, Buttigieg and Biden bunched together at the top of the field in Iowa, though Biden and Warren have generally been co-front-runners elsewhere.
Sanders struck his familiar, defiant tone Friday night, telling the crowd, "We will pass, whether the insurance companies like it or not, Medicare for All."
The event really started hours before the formal program. The damp, chilly streets outside the arena buzzed all afternoon with campaigns hoping to exhibit strong organization and enthusiasm. Supporters and campaign volunteers waved signs at busy street corners and congregated in chanting droves.
Sanders led a pre-event march that his campaign said drew 1,500 people. Warren supporters erected a giant likeness of Bailey, the senator's golden retriever. Inside the arena, Biden bought tickets for members of the International Association of Fire Fighters, which has endorsed him, while Buttigieg had the largest presence, snapping up thousands of seats for supporters that included an overflow room.
Candidates who have traditionally wowed at the gathering have seen it pay big dividends. In 1999, then-Vice President Al Gore effectively blocked former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley's advance with the chant during his speech "Stay and fight," a nudge at Bradley for leaving the Senate.
Four years later, Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry used it to hold off a dire challenge from Howard Dean.
"We need answers, not just anger," Kerry said in a hit at the anti-war Vermont governor who had stirred passions on the left but worried others for challenging President George W. Bush during wartime. "Iowa, don't just send them a message. Send them a president."
More recently, Obama, then an Illinois senator, threw down the gauntlet against national Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton in 2007, declaring, "Triangulating and poll-driven positions, because we're worried about what Mitt or Rudy might say about us, just won't do."

Trump did what Biden wouldn't have

Texto completo: President Trump deserves credit for ordering the operation that killed Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. It was a high-risk mission that required U.S. forces to fly hundreds of miles into al-Qaida-controlled territory to storm a heavily armed terrorist compound. If things had gone horribly wrong, Trump would have been blamed and borne the consequences. Just ask Jimmy Carter how the Desert One disaster affected his reelection. Trump knew the political risks but gave the order to go anyway.
Would Joe Biden have done the same? Unlikely.
The former vice president advised Barack Obama not to carry out the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. As Mark Bowden, author of "The Finish: The Killing of Osama bin Laden," explained in 2012, "The only major dissenters were Biden and [then-Defense Secretary Robert] Gates, and before the raid was launched, Gates would change his mind." During a meeting in the Situation Room, Biden later recalled, Obama turned to him and asked, "Joe, what do you think?" Biden answered, "Mr. President, my suggestion is don't go." Worse, his reason had nothing to do with national security. According to Bowden, Biden told the president that "if the effort failed, Obama could say goodbye to a second term." At the moment America had the man responsible for the 9/11 attacks in her sights, Biden was worried about politics, the absolute last thing a commander in chief should be thinking about in such circumstances. In the end, Bowden writes, "every one of the president's top advisers except Biden was in favor of immediate action."
Yet, rather than praise Trump for ordering the killing of Baghdadi, Biden blasted the president, declaring the raid succeeded "despite his ineptitude as commander in chief." The man who opposed the bin Laden operation criticizes the man who approved the Baghdadi operation? That's rich. And it was the Obama-Biden administration's withdrawal from Iraq in 2011 that allowed the Islamic State to rise from the ashes of defeat and build a caliphate the size of Britain. Talk about ineptitude.
Obama's rejection of Biden's advice not to go after bin Laden does not absolve Obama of criticism for his broader policy in the fight against terrorism. After the bin Laden operation, many pointed out the irony that Obama's signature national security accomplishment was made possible by information gained from the CIA interrogation program that he had shut down on his third day in office. As former acting CIA director Mike Morrell has explained, the key piece of intelligence that led the CIA to bin Laden - information on bin Laden's principal courier, including his nickname Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti - came from detainees in CIA custody.
Similarly, Trump's bold decision to go forward with the Baghdadi operation does not absolve him of criticism for his Syria policy. The fact is, taking out the Islamic State leader would not have been possible without the U.S. boots on the ground that Trump has announced he is withdrawing, or without the help of the Kurdish allies whom Trump is abandoning. It was the Kurds who cultivated the source inside Baghdadi's inner circle who gave us actionable intelligence about his location. So, the Kurds not only took 11,000 casualties in the fight to drive the Islamic State from its physical caliphate, but they also gave us the critical lead that led us to Baghdadi's doorstep. It's fair to ask whether the same operation would have been possible six months from now thanks to Trump's drawdown and betrayal of the Kurds.
Our Kurdish allies deserve better. And we still need them. According to a Pentagon inspector general's report, even before Trump's most recent withdrawal announcement, the Islamic State was "resurging in Syria." It has between 14,000 and 18,000 members, as well as about 3,000 foreign fighters under arms in Syria and Iraq. The New York Times reports that before Trump's decision to greenlight Turkey's invasion, Kurdish forces were conducting as many as a dozen counterterrorism missions a day, but now those have ceased. The Kurds were also guarding about 10,000 captured Islamic State fighters, including about 2,000 foreign fighters. Now, according to the State Department, more than 100 of those detainees have escaped and "we do not know where they are."
And while the loss of Baghdadi is a major blow, the Islamic State has survived similar blows before. Thanks to Trump, Baghdadi is dead. But the Islamic State is not. We still need to keep a boot on its neck, and that requires boots on the ground - and allies such as the Kurds.

Texto completo: Geyserville, Calif.
For 12 hours the night the Kincade fire started, photographer Noah Berger kept his Nissan Xterra running. In the fire zone, Mr. Berger never turns it off. There might not be enough oxygen to start it again.
Mr. Berger drove through blood-orange smoke banks and flame-lined country roads in Northern California wine country, snapping photos for the Associated Press. In the back seat, cameras sat on a packed fire shelter—essentially an aluminum foil coffin the freelancer could climb into as a last resort attempt to survive a burn over.
Stories like this come standard for this group of shooters who deliver the most dramatic shots of California's escalating wildfires. They race to the far corners of the state from June to November to capture the first—and often most consequential—hours of a fire.
"I got hooked on the experience of being out here," Mr. Berger says. "It strips off the mundane layers of life."
When multiple fires break out around the state, they skip from one to the next. Their photos appear in the world's largest newspapers and magazines and have won top photography awards.
In reality, the craft requires Mr. Berger and other freelancers to slog through months of monotonous but better-paying work for corporate clients. (Their day rates for the news assignments are often between $250 and $600.) It also strains family life at home. Much of those months off, Mr. Berger says, are spent anticipating the next season.
Mr. Berger already had a sense of what was ahead back in May. "It's coming; I felt a dry leaf crinkle under my foot this morning when walking the dog," he said then.
The Call Arrives
Five months later, northerly winds whipped across the ridges above Sonoma County's Alexander Valley the night the Kincade fire broke out. Winds have fanned the fire into one of the state's most destructive blazes of the season.
With bags already packed, Mr. Berger left his home in Alameda, an island in San Francisco Bay, within 20 minutes of receiving an alert on his phone about a new fire.
By midnight, Mr. Berger drove up a winding rural road in wine country mountains. He met up with usual fire-shooting partners, Josh Edelson, a freelancer for Agence France-Presse, and Justin Sullivan, a staff photographer with Getty Images.
The fire gained steam. A scanner picking up radio chatter between nearby firefighters crackled: houses on fire down the mountain. The crew, with this reporter following, began a perilous drive around curves obscured by smoke while flaming stumps framed the road. Heat from flames could be felt inside the car. Fire burst out of a manhole.
Mr. Berger jumped out to photograph the first moments a home with a bench press in the yard caught fire. He retreated when the home's propane tank shot ignited gas into the air like a blow torch.
He ran down the street and snapped photos of a burning house, an image that would run on the front page of The Wall Street Journal a day later.
"You push deeper [into the fire zone] and realize it's not as dangerous as you thought. So you push further and further," Mr. Berger said about his evolution into high-stakes fire photography.
As the sun rose over Sonoma County, Mr. Berger jogged through rows of grapevines. From behind a trellis, he photographed a sprawling estate burning to the ground. Tall flames rained ash into a swimming pool and a bocce court smoldered.
In the six years Mr. Berger has shot wildfires, he has become a recognizable figure at wildfires and known affectionately to some as Big Man. At 6-foot-6, he sports a custom-made, extra-long yellow fire jacket. Two cameras dangle from his shoulders. He smokes cigarettes almost nonstop at fires.
Share Your Thoughts
How have you, your friends or family been affected by the California fires? Join the conversation below.
This year, Mr. Berger and two other photographers were Pulitzer Prize finalists for breaking news photography . Their photos of the 2018 fire season included a shot by Mr. Berger of five men carrying a body bag through haze in the destroyed town of Paradise.
Mr. Berger, 45, has a way of maintaining a sense of humor even when witnessing something awful. In an evacuated neighborhood near the Kincade fire, a firefighter wheeled trash bins to the curb to clear a path for a hose crew.
"Big Man!" the firefighter said when he saw Mr. Berger standing on the lawn.
"You taking out the trash?" Mr. Berger bantered.
"Like a normal day, man," the firefighter said before rushing off.
As news coverage of wildfires intensifies and more news crews flock to fire zones, Mr. Berger sometimes winces at the spectacle he acknowledges he's a part of.
"It feels a little more icky than it did a few years ago, like it's an attraction now," Mr. Berger said. Most of all, he worries that rookie photojournalists and television news crews covering this story don't get the importance of staying out of firefighters' way.
Conflicting Demands
At the Kincade fire, the morning weather calmed the blaze and Mr. Berger and his colleagues regrouped along a country road. Stephen Lam, there on assignment for Thomson Reuters and a regular in Mr. Berger's crew, showed up after hours of radio silence, which had been worrying Mr. Berger.
Mr. Edelson, the AFP photographer, agonized about having to leave to shoot executive headshots for San Francisco software company Salesforce.com.
"I emailed the client and said 'I'm literally surrounded by fire,' " Mr. Edelson said. He estimates corporate work pays 10 times what working a fire does. "I only do that work so I can be out here."
Mr. Edelson's photos from the night ran in the Journal, the New York Times and the Los Angeles Times.
Obsessively chasing wildfires for six months each year has become a point of contention back at home for Messrs. Berger and Edelson. The Kincade fire's flare-up on Oct. 27 came the day before Mr. Edelson's wedding anniversary. Torn between the fire and a trip to Santa Catalina Island with his wife, Mr. Edelson pulled an all nighter in the fire zone before flying to Southern California to board a boat the same day.
Mr. Berger worries his lifestyle is contributing to his 9-year-old son's anxiety issues.
Still, the shooters' passion for the craft is only deepening. To improve, they study others' bodies of work. For instance, Santa Rosa Press Democrat staffer Kent Porter's expertise in reading weather and topography puts him in perfect locations, Mr. Berger says.
Stuart Palley is a Newport Beach, Calif.-based photographer and buddy of Mr. Berger's who has also covered this story. (His work has also been used by the Journal .)
"There's an element of time being suspended. I feel in the moment," Mr. Palley said at the Saddleridge fire near Los Angeles in early October.
Mr. Berger spent about a week at the Kincade fire—eating, sleeping, editing photos and socializing with other photographers, all from his car.
When new fires erupted near L.A., Mr. Berger drove across the state to them. Mr. Edelson and his wife cut their anniversary trip short and he joined Mr. Berger.
But soon, when the rains return and firefighters contain the last of the state's fires, the men will call fire season quits. That's sometimes the hard part. "You come back and hear people talking about their prosaic lives," Mr. Berger says. "But your mind is still out there."

Texto completo: A man celebrated for working was taking it easy, sensibly sipping a vodka on the rocks in the bowels of the Wentz Concert Hall on the campus of North Central College in Naperville.
Among the many interesting and daring activities in his 57 years, Mike Rowe became famous as the star and host of the immensely popular "Dirty Jobs." This show ran on the Discovery Channel for eight seasons until 2012 and offered compellingly charming visits with Rowe as he sampled firsthand such grubby trades as chimney sweeper, worm dung farmer, sewer inspector, camel milker and shark repellent tester.
It was a show that always began with these words: "I explore the country looking for people who aren't afraid to get dirty -- hardworking men and women who earn an honest living doing the kinds of jobs that make civilized life possible for the rest of us."
Before and since, and in no particular order, he has hosted other television programs; sold magazine subscriptions door-to-door; hawked such items as dolls, infrared pain relievers, "the first cordless phone I've ever seen," and karaoke machines in the early days of QVC; sang baritone in 30 operas over six years with the chorus of the Baltimore Opera Company; narrated a vast array of commercials and programs, including "Deadliest Catch"; been a frequent guest on news and entertainment programs; started a foundation (mikeroweWORKS Foundation) to provide aspiring trade workers with the financial support to pursue careers; gives speeches for groups and such corporations as Motorola and Hewlett-Packard, and conducts a popular podcast.
Still, he frequently will refer to himself as a "B-list celebrity," and though it is true that he is not as recognizable as Brad Pitt or certain Kardashians and would likely would go unnoticed at a University of Chicago seminar, his claim could easily be disputed by the 700-some people waiting for him upstairs in the Wentz auditorium.
They had started to fill the seats nearly two hours before his scheduled 7 p.m. appearance and each of them carried, for it was included in the $32 admission price, a copy of Rowe's first book, "The Way I Heard It" (Gallery Books). This was yet another in the series of author events staged with creative energy and admirable frequency by the people who run the three Anderson's Books outposts in Naperville, LaGrange and Downers Grove.
Rowe's appearance sold out far in advance. I knew little about him when I was asked to sit on stage with him and ask questions. So, I read his book.
It is, on one level, merely a gathering of 35 of the 140-some stories that have been broadcast on his weekly "The Way I Heard It" podcasts, which began in 2016 and have since been downloaded some 120 million times and counting.
It is impossible for those of a certain age and previous radio listening habits not to recall Paul Harvey, the late and legendary (and I never use that word lightly) Chicago-based radio voice known for more than half a century for his daily news/commentary broadcasts and his "The Rest of the Story" segments.
"Of course, he was an inspiration for me," Rowe said. "So, in a way, was Studs Terkel."
" 'The Rest of the Story' was insanely addictive," Rowe writes. "(He) was a hero to me. ... He always put his subjects first. ... Obviously, I can't fill Paul Harvey's shoes. But I can follow in his footsteps."
As he started the journey, he began to worry and when a letter arrived from Paul Harvey Jr., who had written and produced "The Rest of the Story" for his father, Rowe was, as he writes, "afraid to open it. For all I knew it was a cease-and-desist order regarding my podcast."
Instead -- Rowe did open it -- it was more than a relief. It was a "my dad would have liked what you are doing" note, along with a "generous check" for Rowe's foundation.
"The book was sort of a natural extension," said Rowe. "But when my mother heard about my publishing a collection of the show's segments, she said, 'My, what an amazingly lazy approach to literature.' " It was she who suggested that he expand the book by writing about his own life.
And so that's what you get and you learn that he is originally from Baltimore, the eldest of three sons of schoolteachers, father John, who also acted in amateur theater, and that mother, Peggy, who became an author with her 2018 book "About My Mother: True Stories of a Horse-Crazy Daughter and Her Baseball-Obsessed Mother: A Memoir" (Forefront Books). It's a charming book for which Mike wrote a foreword and which became a surprise bestseller, hitting the bestseller lists of the New York Times and Wall Street Journal.
Meeting and talking to Rowe, it is all but impossible to believe he was, as he writes, "a painfully shy kid with a deep voice and a weird stammer." But you will learn that he overcame that by singing in a barbershop quartet. He went to college, earning a degree in communications, which has, along with life's experiences, served him well.
His personal memories and experiences and tremendous respect for his parents and grandparents balance effortlessly with his essays, changed very, very little from the way he wrote them for 5-minute podcast consumption. They cover a varied gang -- Mel Brooks, Margaret Mitchell, Beethoven, the Statue of Liberty, William Randolph Hearst, Charles Manson, James Dean, Laika (the Soviet space dog of the late 1950s), Rod Serling, Bob Dylan, Ted Williams -- that attest to Rowe's wide-ranging curiosity.
The book's title is the result of what Rowe says is being "exhausted by experts who tell me with absolute certainty 'that's the way it was.' I'm weary of the correctors. History is always written by the winners, and our own personal memories are often tainted by romantic versions of who we wish we were. In a world of 'fake news' and dubious hyperlinks, this book is a way to manage expectations, and hopefully, inject a little humility into a book that technically resides in the nonfiction section."
So, we talked (mostly he talked) on the Wentz stage for more than an hour. A woman asked a question. She was wearing an "I love Mike Rowe" T-shirt. Rowe was friendly, funny, smart, sincere and self-effacing. He told some stories that are contained in the book. He told others, some off-color enough that they playfully taxed the abilities of Carol McGuinn, the woman sitting with us on stage signing for those who were hearing-impaired.
I did not get a chance to ask him about his dog, Freddy, or his longtime (24 years and counting) girlfriend Sandy or why he lives in San Francisco or what he thinks of Chicago.
That came a few days later when Rowe told me, "Promoting a book is a lot like falling down the stairs. You cover a lot of ground, but not without incurring a few bumps and bruises along the way. Naperville, however, was an absolute delight. The crowd was great, and I was more conscious than usual. ... It's hard to have a bad time in Chicago."
We were talking on the day that "The Way I Heard It" jumped into the top five on the New York Times and Amazon bestseller lists, sharing that rarefied territory with books by Elton John and Rachel Maddow.
So, about that B-list celebrity business?
"I suppose all it means is that I'm no longer a C-list celebrity," he said.

Texto completo: Forget Amazon or Toyota - business schools ought to teach efficiency through the example of Central Provisions.
The eclectic, Old Port small-plates restaurant has just shy of 50 full-service slots for diners. Forty-eight, to be precise, including bar seating and tight two- and four-top tables upstairs, along with several standing-height flat surfaces chef/owner Chris Gould calls "rails" in the bar downstairs. Crowding just four-dozen diners into the exposed brick rooms feels like an accomplishment.
Yet during the frothiest days of summer's tourist season, through some dark species of physics-warping trickery, Central Provisions manages to feed upwards of 500 people a day.
"We close every year for two weeks at the beginning of January and take the notes we've made throughout the year on how the space could be utilized better," Gould said. "We add some little nooks and crannies to store things, redo the floors, but in general it doesn't change much. It looks very much the same as it did when we opened (in February 2014). But there's no more space coming."
Central Provisions' remarkable ability to operate at peak capacity comes at a price, however. The restaurant famously takes no reservations - a policy Chris Gould and his spouse and business partner, Paige Gould, instituted about a year after they opened. No-shows and late parties translated to empty seats, and with dining room real estate at such a premium, they made the choice to move to a first-come, first-served system, with a technology-driven waiting list application to contact customers when a table becomes available.
If a table becomes available.
Twice over the past month, I added myself to that list (once early in the week and once on a weekend) and was told by a host (who must be sick of giving this speech) that my wait would likely extend beyond the three-to-four hours left in both nights' dinner service.
One of these times, out of pure curiosity, I asked to be placed into the queue anyway and watched as my party of two went from 21st in line (!) to fourth before the kitchen shuttered for the night.
So I postponed, opting to wait to write about Central Provisions until shoulder season began its frosty fade-out. This time, my guest and I both planned to skip lunch and arrive for dinner long before sunset, at what a friend fondly calls "assisted living midnight."
Within minutes, we were tearing apart slices of Standard Baking Company sourdough, eagerly spreading them with espresso-and-cocoa-nib butter, nubbly with chunks of toasted hazelnut and dunking our crusts into a savory, gelatin-stabilized sabayon of egg yolk, lemon and Riesling ($8).
While according to Chris Gould, the kitchen has made "at least 20 different versions of that dish," tweaking it several times every year, it remains a fixture on the restaurant's permanent menu, alongside dishes like bluefin tuna crudo with radish, shallot and mustard ($18) that a former critic from this paper raved about in a five-star review from 2014.
When I tried the 2019 version of that same tuna crudo on another recent visit, standing downstairs at one of the "rails," I was wowed by the layering of sharpness with sweet, ductile slices of raw Maine tuna. It's hard to argue with the logic of retaining more than a third of the menu for these Central Provisions standards, because for the most part, they're fantastic.
I wasn't quite as taken with the experience of eating my meal off what felt like a shelf installed next to someone's cellar staircase, but in a pinch, when crowds are at their peak, it'll do.
"There's a unique difference in the experiences. It's not by design, but upstairs you get to sit, and it has become more of a refined experience," Chris Gould said. "Downstairs tends to be people popping in for a snack, although some people do have full meals down there."
Indeed, the lower level of Central Provisions gestures towards an Iberian-style, vertical mode of drinking and snacking that the Goulds witnessed on their honeymoon in Spain. "Lots of people said it wouldn't work, that people wouldn't do it here. But they do," Chris Gould, a native Mainer, said.
The easy appeal of the restaurant's wine list has a lot to do with why. Spanning New and Old World styles, with pricey bottles and pours of white, red, rosÃ© and orange wines that average $12 a glass, this list has something for everyone. And miraculously, something that cozies up nicely with nearly every one of the restaurant's more than two dozen small plates.
Mixing and matching dishes from the ultra-ecumenical menu, on the other hand, can be a challenge. My dinner guest and I wondered aloud how things might turn out if we ordered that evening's sticky, hoisin-painted Peking duck for two ($45) alongside a very French plate of caramelized sheep's cheese, prickling with Espelette pepper and tangy from drizzles of quince saba ($12), and maybe the North Spore mushroom fricassÃ©e on a bruise-colored, dried-out polenta cake flavored with pig's blood ($22).
"Uhh...maybe not," our server counseled.
What she did not tell us (and what I have never heard before while dining at Central Provisions) is that despite the restaurant's up-front cautions that "dishes come out when they're ready," there is actually a methodical, on-the-fly course-pacing that happens when tickets hit the kitchen.
"We train servers to steer people to get something from the raw section, cold, hot," Chris Gould explained. "It's like taking a tasting menu at a Michelin-style place and opening it up. Then we'll organize it so it makes sense. We get the ticket and fire accordingly."
Partly, that's to retain harmony across a meal, and partly because Central Provisions' tiny tables wouldn't accommodate the simultaneous arrival of the three-to-four dishes per diner that servers recommend.
And the kitchen, led by chef de cuisine Edward Moreau, does course out meals well, scheduling delightful, crunchy-shelled cod cheek tempura with house-made kosho that lacerates with talons of capsaicin and citrus peel ($16) long after the eye-popping tangy-bitter crunch of radicchio, candied walnuts and cider vinegar reduction in the local apple salad ($12).
Certain dishes also feel like born spacers, slotting into a meal wherever a natural break is not obvious. One, the fried cauliflower ($14) with mint, chickpeas and matchstick apples is another Central Provisions classic that has been around since I first visited the restaurant four years ago. Back then, I fell hard for its Levantine spice blend - a local reimagination of ras el hanout, here made with buzzy, numbing grains of paradise, ground rose hips and dried anise hyssop that the Goulds harvest from their own home garden. I loved it so much that I attempted to reverse engineer it for Thanksgiving in 2015.
Now, I couldn't wait for my dinner guest, a fellow food writer, to try it. "Wait a minute," she said, levering torn mint leaves from the top layer to peek underneath. "Isn't there supposed to be cauliflower in this?" It was there, but barely. Amid an abundance of fork-tender chickpeas, we found just two tiny florets in the dish.
This was not the evening's only misfire. Our final dish, a dessert of oven-roasted fig halves served in a savory chocolate pte brisÃ©e crust ($10) was upended by caustic tartness from a citric-acid-and-lime-enriched crÃ¨me fraÃ®che. With flavors that teetered too close to those of spoiled dairy, it overwhelmed the dessert.
All the stranger, considering that acid balance is normally one of Central Provisions' culinary superpowers. Nowhere is it more in evidence than in the suckling pig, another of the restaurant's evergreen menu items, where a glossy purÃ©e of local apples caramelized in butter, then deglazed with apple cider vinegar makes a luxurious nest for rectangles of tender pulled pork capped with salted, plancha-crisped skin ($16).
The dish resembles pork belly, but its tender shreds of meat reveal a true New Englander's commitment to the ethos of "waste-not, want-not"- each slice of the terrine-like pressÃ© is refashioned from meat taken from the entire, overnight-roasted piglet. It is balanced, autumnal and wholly unsacrificing in its efficiency.

Texto completo: Why Anna Deavere Smith handed Michael Benjamin Washington a revival of her breakthrough 1992 documentary solo show about the Crown Heights race riot.
On August 19, 1991, in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn, a car in the motorcade of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, leader of the Lubavitch Hasidic movement, sped through a red light, struck another car, swerved onto the sidewalk and hit and killed Gavin Cato, a 7-year-old black boy from Guyana, while severely injuring his cousin Angela.
Almost immediately, rumors spread that an ambulance, privately run by the Hasidim, had taken the driver and his fellow passengers to the hospital, while the young black children lay bleeding on the ground.
That night, a group of young black men retaliated by stabbing Yankel Rosenbaum, a 29-year-old Orthodox Jewish scholar from Australia, who eventually died in the same hospital as Gavin. Over the next three days, a race riot erupted, in which black residents protested the police, stormed the Lubavitcher headquarters, and targeted Jewish businesses. Hasidic patrols sought to defend their community by attacking their black neighbors.
Shortly afterward, the playwright and actress Anna Deavere Smith began interviewing black and Jewish residents of Crown Heights, as well as creative artists and community leaders. She managed to talk to those most personally affected by the tragedies, too, including Yankel Rosenbaum's brother, Norman, and Gavin Cato's father, Carmel.
"Fires in the Mirror," a one-woman show based on the interviews, was set to premiere at the Public Theater on April 30, 1992. But the day before, when a mostly white jury acquitted the four Los Angeles police officers who beat Rodney King, the Public briefly closed over fears of racial violence.
In May, "Fires in the Mirror," which had Smith playing nearly 30 real-life characters, debuted to rave reviews. What makes the show "so moving and provocative, so remarkably free of cant and polemics," Frank Rich wrote in The New York Times, "is its creator's ability to find the unexpected and unguarded in nearly each speaker and her objective grasp of the troubling big picture."
In subsequent versions, even the one filmed in 1993 for "American Playhouse" on PBS, Smith changed the sequencing but continued to do the performance as a one-woman show.
Until now.
Opening on Nov. 11 at the Signature Theater Company, "Fires in the Mirror" stars Michael Benjamin Washington ("The Boys in the Band"), the first solo actor besides Smith to take on this multifaceted role. Saheem Ali ("The Rolling Stone") is the director.
The production kicks off Smith's Signature residency; her "Twilight: Los Angeles 1992," on the riots there, will be revived later in its season.
In a lively interview at the theater last week, Smith and Washington talked about what a male actor brings to the play, his appreciation for the fluidity of her characters and what the play still has to teach us about race and American identity. An edited version of the conversation follows.
Anna, I read an interview in which you described being disappointed when a man came up to you after an early performance and told you, "I wish that a male actor had been cast." How did that impact how you approached this revival?
ANNA DEAVERE SMITH This was when it was at the Public Theater. This brother came over and said: "You know, I'm just curious. Didn't you meet any strong, black man that you wanted to include?" I was like: "Strong black men? Well, how about Mr. Cato? How about Conrad Muhammad, whether you agree with him or not. You can't say he's not strong. How about Al Sharpton?" I thought, "Oh, for him, if he doesn't see the black male body, he's not seeing himself." And so I don't count either. There is this feeling that only a black man could be a black man. That's not philosophically where I live.
When we went looking for an individual who was going to play this part, everyone assumed it was going to be a woman. But I wanted to see if it makes a difference to have the presence of a black male body onstage. So I campaigned for them to see men as well as women in casting.
Michael, you play so many characters -- a Haitian teenage girl, an anonymous Lubavitcher woman, Angela Davis, and black and Jewish adolescent boys. Were you at all concerned with taking on so many different types at once?
MICHAEL BENJAMIN WASHINGTON Not at all. I grew up doing competitive speech and debate. "Fires in the Mirror" was a piece that was run on the circuit of our high school competitions. It was part of our training to become as fluid as possible, to play men and women and different races and ethnicities and religions and sexual orientations. So when I got this part, it was like a return home.
Back then, it was considered part-journalism, part-theater. Now can we just call it a play?
SMITH I'm happy to hear you call it a play. I've always wanted other actors to do this work. My early work had 20 actors in a group, and I was working toward having an acting troupe that would go around America and mirror cities and their incidents. What you see now came out of that process.
WASHINGTON Dramaturgically, it's one of the soundest plays I've ever read. Every time I read it, which is every morning and every night, I find another thread in the tapestry that connects the themes. And since I didn't have access to all the tape recordings, because some of them no longer exist, I get to use my imagination. What's important to remember is that she was able to write it down on the page in poem form. If you follow the line breaks, which is following the logic of the thought, you can hear the person come alive.
This play was performed at a really contentious moment in American history. How do you think it stands today?
SMITH My theory about race in this country is it goes up and down. We have this period -- "Oh, post-racial" -- and then all of a sudden: "Oh, no. We're not!" But I think it's always there. When Richard Green [the former director of the Crown Heights Youth Collective] says, "These kids are running to cops with nothing in their hands," that distinct image makes me think of right now.
WASHINGTON Yeah. I would usually have a breakdown at that moment in the rehearsal room, and I was like, "Nope, you've got to keep going because these men lived it."
SMITH It breaks your heart. Right?
WASHINGTON It does. But they would fight through that emotionality and go into action. Even Mr. Cato at the very end, he's telling his story, but you can tell that he is not going to be victimized. He's going to figure out what he has to do to overcome.
SMITH I also think the Jewish people have to always be on guard. Anti-Semitism could appear any time.
WASHINGTON: It was really spooky last Tuesday night [the show is currently in previews]. There was a voice-over of Clarence Thomas talking about being a victim of "high-tech lynching," and the audience collectively gasped because Trump's own lynching comment was trending.
We rarely get to hear such a wide range of people disagreeing with each other at the same time. What are you saying about democracy?
WASHINGTON We're putting characters on a stage that just aren't there normally, people who aren't given voices. And that was 25 years ago. That was so revolutionary. And it still is.
SMITH I revere difference. How do we meet the stranger? With hatred or kindness? Do we all become the same? I say no.

Texto completo: Santa Anita, which hosted the race, has seen 37 horses die this year. On Saturday, the 4-year-old Mongolian Groom was taken away by ambulance with a leg injury and euthanized.
ARCADIA, Calif. -- Through the 14 races run and nationally televised over the weekend as part of the Breeders' Cup World Championships here at Santa Anita Park, anyone who loved this picturesque racetrack -- or the beauty of thoroughbreds in full flight -- held their breaths as one multimillion-dollar race after another concluded without a horse taking a bad step.
After all, 36 horses had died here since Dec. 30 in all kinds of ways.
So, when the New York-based horse Vino Rosso crossed the finish line here on Saturday to win the $ 6 million Breeders' Cup Classic, the event's marquee race and the final one on the card, the collective exhale of relief was nearly audible.
Unnoticed by most of the announced crowd of 67,811, however, was that a horse named Mongolian Groom had taken that dreaded bad step and was suddenly pulled up in the stretch by his jockey, Abel Cedillo, after establishing himself in third place and looking every bit like a contender to win North America's most prestigious race.
Instead, an equine ambulance was soon barreling down the stretch and, as NBC broadcast to its prime-time audience a jubilant celebration in the box of Vino Rosso's owner, Mike Repole, Mongolian Groom was loaded into the truck and taken to a hospital on Santa Anita's barn area beneath the rouge-tipped San Gabriel Mountains.
The diagnosis was dire -- a serious fracture of the horse's left hind limb. The prescription was all too familiar: Mongolian Groom was euthanized and became the 37th and most high-profile dead horse at Santa Anita.
"The death of Mongolian Groom is a loss to the entire horse racing community," the Breeders' Cup organizers said in a statement. "Our equine and human athletes' safety is the Breeders' Cup's top priority."
About 10 thoroughbred horses die a week at American racetracks, according to the Jockey Club's Equine Injury Database, and the scourge of drugs -- painkillers and performance enhancers -- has been acknowledged by industry leaders. The American death toll is anywhere from two and a half to five times greater than the fatality rate in Europe and Asia, where rules against performance-enhancing drugs are enforced more stringently.
In fact, the Jockey Club and other prominent owners and breeders have endorsed a bipartisan bill in Congress called the Horseracing Integrity Act of 2019, which would create a private, independent authority to develop and administer a nationwide antidoping and medication control program for horse racing.
Santa Anita has been a flash point in the dialogue about horse safety. Over the summer, the Breeders' Cup board, composed of the sport's main movers and shakers, considered moving its annual event from the troubled track.
But Craig Fravel, the Breeders' Cup president and chief executive officer, said that the board had decided to stay with Santa Anita after its owners, the Stronach Group, enacted some of the most aggressive and stringent drug and safety rules.
In the coming days, Fravel will leave his post at the Breeders' Cup to become head of racing operations at the Stronach Group.
The deaths of Mongolian Groom and the 36 other horses this year highlight both the dangerous and haphazard nature of horse racing and, in some cases, the recklessness and callousness of some of the humans who own, train and make a living off the horses. On Oct. 27, a 2-year-old filly named Bye Bye Beautiful became the 36th horse to die at Santa Anita after breaking her leg.
It has been a nightmare for one of America's oldest sports that has grown into a multibillion-dollar agribusiness. Veterinary care has been improving, but it remains difficult to rehabilitate horses from fractures because they cannot be immobilized. The wave of horse deaths has prompted a national discussion, often angry, between animal rights activists and horse people of what exactly is cruelty and abuse and what is, frankly, the breaks of the game.
Santa Anita's precarious place in both the sport and the orbit of California politics has been stated in no certain terms by Gov. Gavin Newsom and Senator Dianne Feinstein, both Democrats of California.
"I believe this weekend presents a critical test for the future of horse racing in California and in the United States," Feinstein wrote on the eve of the two-day event. "If horse racing cannot be conducted in a safe and humane manner that protects the life and safety of horses and jockeys, it may be time to re-examine the future of this sport in our state and in our country."
Newsom was even more direct.
"I'll tell you -- talk about a sport whose time is up unless they reform," he said recently at a meeting with New York Times reporters. "That's horse racing. Incredible abuses to these precious animals and the willingness to just to spit these animals out and literally take their lives is a disgrace."

Texto completo: The assassination of an Afghan government employee while his daughter was next to him has underscored the lasting trauma of the intensifying war.
KANDAHAR, Afghanistan -- It was a daddy-daughter moment. It turned into a reminder of the lasting trauma of the intensifying conflict in Afghanistan.
Amanullah Watandost, 42, who was employed by an Afghan security unit that works closely with the C.I.A., was behind the wheel of his Toyota Corolla on Thursday afternoon. His 3-year-old daughter, Madina, wearing a dress with a pink bottom and two pink bows, was in the seat next to him. They were out shopping for groceries in Arghandab, a district in the south that has long been a hotbed of Taliban militants.
Mr. Watandost was particularly close to his daughter, often bringing her along wherever he went. He and his wife had adopted Madina after not being able to have a child of their own in 20 years of marriage, according to family members. Mr. Watandost had lost four of his brothers to the war; like him, they all worked for the security forces.
Madina was his distraction from the sorrow weighing down the family.
On a quiet stretch of the road, an assassin pulled up and emptied three rounds into Mr. Watandost through the car window. No one else was close enough to hear the gunshots.
When other cars and passers-by saw the vehicle in the middle of the road, they noticed Mr. Watandost's body collapsed to the side. Madina was standing in her seat, looking over her father's closed eyes.
"We did not hear any shooting; nobody heard any shooting," said Haji Shah Aka, a neighbor. "He was dead in his seat, and his little daughter was in the front seat traumatized."
In the photos of the assassination that spread on social media, he is slumped back, the wound on his shoulder visible -- one of the three spots where Mr. Watandost had been hit.
In all of the photos, Madina seems shellshocked. No tears. In one, she's staring at the distance. In another, she is glancing at her father's closed eyes, her arms clasped around her stomach.
"After I saw the photo, I got such a headache that I couldn't fall asleep until 1 a.m.," said Iqbal Khyber, the leader of the People's Peace Movement, which has traveled around the country trying to raise the collective consciousness about the daily violence. "Both sides have picked up guns against each other and have said they will kill each other."
"But what about this child? What say did she have in her father's decision?" he said. "She is traumatized for the rest of her life."
The war has dragged on so long, and has spread so far, that any conventions of conflict -- or local traditions of chivalry to protect women and children -- seem forgotten, broken by both sides.
The militants carry out suicide bombings in mosques and wedding halls, boundaries rarely crossed before. In places like Kandahar, they have repeatedly assassinated female government employees, often with their young children at their side.
Government soldiers barge into homes in the middle of the night, accused of shooting and killing as women and children watch. Both the American and Afghan militaries carry out frequent airstrikes, sometimes resulting in civilian casualties.
No one has claimed responsibility for the assassination of Mr. Watandost, which the government blamed on the Taliban. Within 24 hours, the Kandahar governor's office said the assassin had been killed in a raid by intelligence forces.
For more than a decade, Mr. Watandost had worked for a C.I.A.-backed strike force that operates out of Kandahar. Such units have been repeatedly accused of abuses, including summary executions. A Human Rights Watch report recently detailed more than a dozen such cases for which the units have not been held accountable.
Last May, one of the C.I.A.-backed units barged into a home in the middle of the night, killing a father, his two adult sons and one grandson. The grandson, Adel Shah, 10, received a shrapnel wound from the initial blast when the forces detonated the gate with explosives to create an entry.
Adel's father was sleeping in the yard. In warm weather, many Afghans bring charpoy beds outside.
"My father was shot in his bed," Adel, his eyes bloodshot and his wounded head patched up, said the day after the raid. The women and children in the family were all put in one room and told not come out until an hour after the forces had left the house -- or helicopters would shoot them.
In that period, Adel's father bled to death in the yard.
Civilians -- along with children who become both witnesses and victims -- are often caught in the increasingly ruthless violence carried out by both sides. In the Darqad district of northern Takhar Province on Saturday, a roadside bomb killed at least five children on their way to school and wounded three.
Mr. Khyber, the peace activist, said what troubled him the most was that the frequency of violence had desensitized Afghans so much that gruesome episodes like Madina's watching her father's death only briefly captured the national attention.
Then people move on, shocked by something more extreme. He likened it to the example of the homeless people who sleep in a train station, their slumber undisturbed by the loud noise of the trains.
"The biggest misfortune is that we are used to this daily killing," Mr. Khyber said. "Today the people paused, but tomorrow they forget about it. The next incident needs to be even more cruel than this to be noticed."

Texto completo: Boris Johnson's government, which is preparing for a general election, said the ban would be in place until there was "compelling new evidence" that it could be carried out safely.
LONDON -- Prime Minister Boris Johnson once hailed fracking as "glorious news for humanity," and said the British government should "leave no stone unturned, or unfracked."
But in a major U-turn, Mr. Johnson's government announced on Saturday that it would temporarily halt fracking in the only active site in Britain, in northwestern England. The move came after a government agency, the Oil and Gas Authority, concluded this past week that it could not rule out "unacceptable" consequences for people living near fracking sites, including pollution risks and earthquake-related damage.
It was a victory for environmental groups, and might deprive opposition parties of a potentially powerful campaign issue in a general election just weeks away.
Jonathan Bartley, a leader of the Green Party, described the move as "very, very welcome." But he told the BBC that the group wanted an absolute commitment from the government to ban the practice outright.
On Twitter, his co-leader, Sian Berry, wrote: "Banning fracking is for life, not just for Christmas."
The leader of the opposition Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, tweeted on Saturday that the government moratorium was only a "temporary pause" and "an election stunt to try and win a few votes." His party would ban fracking permanently, he said.
Fracking, also known as hydraulic fracturing, involves injecting water, sand and chemicals at high pressure to fracture shale rock and recover natural gas from it. The practice has proved controversial and carries potential environmental and community costs.
In the Netherlands, hundreds of earthquakes linked to gas extraction have damaged thousands of homes and buildings. France and Germany have banned fracking, and Scotland and Wales have long had their own moratoriums on the technique.
The extracting technique is a major source of oil and gas revenues in the United States, Canada and Argentina. It has been bitterly opposed by environmental activists and local groups in Britain, where a series of earthquakes, including one in August, have hit the only active fracking site in the country, near the seaside town Blackpool.
Britain's business and energy secretary, Andrea Leadsom, said on Saturday that shale gas had "huge potential" but that its exploration should be "carried out safely."
"After reviewing the O.G.A.'s report into recent seismic activity at Preston New Road, it is clear that we cannot rule out future unacceptable impacts on the local community," Ms. Leadsom said in a statement.
Activities at the site near Blackpool, managed by the shale gas group Cuadrilla Resources, were suspended after the Aug. 26 earthquake, which measured 2.9 on the Richter scale.
In May 2011, shale gas drilling was suspended at the Blackpool site after small earthquakes were documented by the British Geological Survey. Last year, Cuadrilla halted fracking after a tremor measuring 0.8 magnitude was recorded.
The company had no immediate reaction to the government's moratorium on Saturday.
Fracking has been views as a potentially toxic issue for the governing Conservative Party. Unlike in the United States, where shale gas can be extracted in remote areas, many potential fracking sites in densely populated Britain have been near residential areas, where residents have often angrily opposed it.
According to the newspaper The Yorkshire Post, an event at the Conservative Party conference in September discussed the potential for fracking to affect up to 200 electoral districts, 40 of them marginal.
Protesters have camped for years near the Preston Road site and have fought the company in court. Three protesters were jailed in September 2018 for blocking the site and climbing on trucks there, and protesters once kept 24-hour vigils to monitor Cuadrilla's activity.
"To contaminate a major food-growing area for a little bit of gas is insane," a retired university professor, Celia Briar, told The New York Times in 2018.
Governments in Britain, which has long valued its oil industry, have supported shale exploration for the major revenues the technique could bring. Yet, a government spending watchdog found last month that the government had invested 32 million pounds, or $ 41 million, in fracking activities since 2011, with little result so far.
The government said the new moratorium would be put in place with immediate effect and continue until "compelling new evidence" had shown that fracking did not put local populations at risk.

Texto completo: My family's beloved 128-pound bullmastiff, Oliver, could no longer walk.
He went from being a happy, tail-thumpin', gentle giant to being terminally ill in one week.
My parents and I literally carried him to get his belly X-rayed on Monday, and seeing him lying on the veterinarian's floor made me realize he would soon die. His breathing was labored. His normally expressive eyes were lifeless. His ears, paws and gray-whiskered muzzle were cold to the touch.
The X-rays revealed blurry masses in his chest and abdomen. Oliver was two weeks shy of being 9, which is old for the breed.
We took him to my parents' home Monday night and covered him with a blanket with only his wrinkly head poking out from underneath the comforter.
My girlfriend and I visited and heard his tail-thump greeting for the final time. We petted him, told him he was a good boy, and that we loved him to pieces, hoping he knew how much joy he brought to our lives.
We took Oliver back to the vet on Tuesday for an ultrasound to define the masses, but he died within two hours, possibly from an abdominal tumor.
While I worked that day and was productive, that wasn't the case Monday. I sobbed my whole way home from the vet's office and called my editor, trying to compose myself to explain why I wouldn't be able to work that day. She understood. I've met her dog, PJ, a couple of times.
We pet owners -- as we cradle a puppy or kitten in our arms -- know we'll face a tough choice one day. Bailey was my first bullmastiff so I've been through this before, but it's never easy.
"They are our furry little babies and they rely on us for their very existence," radio talk-show host Mark Levin told me Tuesday. "And we rely on them to help bring us through tough times, or mundane times. They are always happy ... loving, and they are always giving."
Levin wrote the New York Times bestseller "Rescuing Sprite" after he made the gut-wrenching decision in 2006 to put down his beloved spaniel-mix rescue dog, Sprite.
It was his first time making that choice, and he spent two months fighting depression as a result.
"They have no agendas," he said. "They have no hate. They have qualities that in many ways are better than human qualities. In my case I was extremely guilty because, like so many others, I had to decide the day and time when he was going to die. It's a family member -- and that's what they are -- and I felt extremely guilty."
Levin's book is now printed in several languages. He's gotten correspondences from people worldwide who have shared their stories and how they endured the universal pain we all feel when losing a pet.
Levin, a conservative, gladly takes calls from liberals who want to share their pet stories.
"I've said it a hundred times myself: This has nothing to do with ideology or politics -- none of it," he said. "If you're a good dog person, you're a good person."
The hardest part about Oliver's final days was not knowing the pain he felt.
"The problem is they can't talk to you and that's what you want from them," said Levin, who is donating a sizeable chunk of the book's profits to animal charities.
"In some cases it's easier to say goodbye to an older person," he said. "You can talk to them, come to some kind of conclusion. You want (pets) to know how much we love them, and you hope they know it. Sprite sniffed my hand; he wanted reassurance. I had trouble living with that. I have trouble talking about it."
Someone wrote me that the Lenape Indians believed that when you die, your previously deceased dogs will come down to escort you up to heaven. The better you treated your dog, the faster it will meet you.
I can picture Ollie and Bailey running around up there, sleeping on God's couch after being told not to, drooling all over God's kitchen floor causing Julia Child to slip, and peeing every 10 seconds as God walks them around the clouds.
And I love the idea of Oliver and Bailey, tails a-thumpin', greeting me on my way to heaven. And I'm sure they will be joined by a few more bullmastiffs as they lead me home.

Texto completo: Farewell, little dynasty.
That splat you heard was the the Warriors, who dominated the NBA the past five seasons as it went from marginally profitable to immensely wealthy, hitting the pavement like an egg dropped from space.
Of course, it’s still way early to write them off, as TNT’s Charles Barkley did, predicting they wouldn’t even make the playoffs … at halftime of their opener … or, at least it was until Steph Curry broke his hand in the fourth game.
There’s now a common theme in Warriors stories
Will they tank?
Shouldn’t they tank?
Are they tanking?
Isn’t it timely that they lost Curry, removing the temptation to claw into the playoffs so they can tank … as owner Joe Lacob seemed to suggest to The Athletic (“Potentially, there’s a silver lining in all of this, who knows?”)
Not that the Warriors may have a choice with all of last spring’s nine rotation players, and all three of their Big Three, out or gone for the duration: Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson Andre Iguodala, Shaun Livingston, DeMarcus Cousins and Quinn Cook.
That left Draymond Green, who hurt just his left index finger, and Kevon Looney, who’s out with a pulled hamstring.
Things started off challenging with Las Vegas setting their over-under at 47 wins, No. 6 or 7 in the West.
Then, unfortunately for the Warriors, the season started.
Game 1: In the opening of the new Chase Center, the Clippers beat them by 19 points, after leading by 31.
Thompson, recovering from knee surgery, goes on with TNT at halftime, airs his hopes … and has Barkley inform him to his face they won’t make the playoffs.
As if agreeing, Coach Steve Kerr notes, “This is not a one-off. This is the reality. There are going to be nights like this this year.”
Game 2: Showing Kerr was right, they lose by 28 in Oklahoma City … after trailing by 41 … to the Thunder, a 1-4 team going into this weekend.
Game 3: Win in New Orleans!
Game 4: Lose by 11 in Phoenix … after trailing by 33.
In the very bad, awful, no good, worst possible news, Curry breaks his left hand early in the third quarter with the Warriors down by 29.
Game 5: Back home, lose to Spurs by 17 … after trailing by 25.
They now start Green, D’Angelo Russell, Glenn Robinson, Willie Cauley-Stein and rookie Jordan Poole, looking more like an expansion team than a dynasty.
This isn’t just a fall. This is the end of the pride of the NBA.
The Warriors didn’t invent the modern offense, spacing the floor with three-point shooters. That was Mike D’Antoni in coaching stints at Phoenix, New York and Houston.
Nevertheless, it was Steph, Klay & Co. who took it and ran with it, popularizing an approach that had always been anathema, expressed by the mantra, “Live by the jump shot, die by the jump shot.”
With their unprecedented firepower came a coincidence of personalities that made the Warriors a delight for the press and lured KD as a free agent in 2016: the personable Kerr … the sweet-tempered Curry, everyone’s favorite … the unaffected Thompson … the trash-talking, stand-up guy, Green.
“To me, they speak not just to the modern NBA, but to the unique place that sports can have in society,” said Commissioner Adam Silver before the season.
“And it’s not just the spirit they bring to the game on the floor, but, I think, the spirit they bring as citizens and to their participation in their community.”
The ascent was symbolized by the $1.4 billion Chase Center they built in San Francisco with money they raised privately, leaving the boondocks of the East Bay.
With personal seat licenses estimated at $18,000 each, revenue is projected to zoom from last season’s $400 million that was already ahead of the Lakers’ $398 million, according to Forbes, to $700 million … ahead of every team in every U.S. league except the Dallas Cowboys.
This is a new reality, indeed. The Lakers, long the NBA’s richest team, used to wish there was no salary cap so they could spend whatever they wanted. Now they can thank their lucky stars there is one
(Giannis Antetokuonmpo, anyone? He’s not free until 2021 but the big teams are eyeing him in all they do.)
The Warriors cherished the fact they were all in this together, but it was no longer true.
Things began unraveling last fall when Green argued with Durant, who had spurned an extension to sign for one year, signaling his intention to become a free agent.
“We won without you,” snapped Green, according to Yahoo’s Chris Haaynes. “We don’t need you. Leave.”
Dray and KD made up, insisting it was behind them in countless interviews … until last week when Durant, now in Brooklyn, acknowledged the blowup had been a factor in his decision to leave (“I mean, your teammate talked to you that way, you think about it. … Definitely, for sure. I’m not going to lie about it.”)
Nevertheless, the Warriors clung to their illusions to the bitter end when Durant went down in Game 5 of the Finals.
GM Bob Myers choked back tears in the interview room. Teammates were glum, despite having just won to cut the Raptors’ lead to 3-2.
If KD wanted most of all to be loved, it looked like the outpouring of grief might persuade him to stay.
Instead, he signed with the Nets to play alongside Kyrie Irving, who is already reportedly showing the mood swings in Brooklyn that he had in Cleveland and Boston.
Of course, the Warriors will try to put Humpy Dumpty back together next season, but they’re not the kids they were when they won the first of their three titles in 2015.
Curry, 31, was averaging 20 points and 2.3 threes, compared to his pre-KD zenith of 30 and 5.1 … as Kerr noted they can’t just turn Steph loose, a la James Harden (“That kind of basketball wears you out, especially for a guy who’s 180 pounds like Steph is.”)
With all those shot attempts and points gone, Green, 29, is averaging a pale 9.4 points, 7.8 rebounds, 5.2 assists and 0.0 blocks, compared to his pre-KD zenith of 14-10-7 with 1.4 blocks.
Thompson, 30, may be coming off a missed season.
You can’t say they didn’t enjoy the journey. In 2015 after winning their first title, Lacob told the New York Times, “We’re light years ahead of probably every other team in structure, in planning, in how we’re going to go about things. We’re going to be a handful for the rest of the NBA to deal with for a long time.”
So they were, but “a long time” is over, the Warriors just learned.

NY governor on Donald Trump's Florida move: 'Good riddance'

Texto completo: ALBANY – Gov. Andrew Cuomo is not lamenting President Donald Trump's decision to change his residency from his lifelong home of New York to Florida.
"Good riddance," the Democratic governor said in a statement late Thursday.
The New York Times reported Thursday that Trump, a Republican, and first lady Melania Trump filed separate "declarations of domicile" in Florida last month, a legal move that shifts his residency from Manhattan to his Mar-A-Lago Club in Palm Beach.
The move means Trump's permanent residence will no longer be Trump Tower, the Manhattan building where he has long called home.
And it means New York will no longer be able to lay claim to being the home of the sitting president, though Cuomo — like Trump, a native of the New York City borough of Queens — did not seem to mind.
"It's not like Mr. Trump paid taxes here anyway," Cuomo said in his statement. "He's all yours, Florida."
Trump confirmed the move in a series of tweets Thursday night, criticizing state leaders for what he said was unfair treatment.
"I cherish New York, and the people of New York, and always will, but unfortunately, despite the fact that I pay millions of dollars in city, state and local taxes each year, I have been treated very badly by the political leaders of both the city and state," the president wrote.
Trump has repeatedly clashed with Cuomo and other Democratic officials in his former home state.
Cuomo has repeatedly criticized Trump for the 2017 Republican tax reforms that limited state and local tax deductions to $10,000, a change that disproportionately affected wealthy residents of high-tax states like New York.
State Attorney General Letitia James' office is currently leading dozens of legal actions challenging the Trump administration's policies and actions.
In June, state lawmakers approved a bill allowing the state to release Trump's state tax returns — which the president has declined to make public — to certain congressional committees, if requested. Cuomo signed the bill into law the next month.
And Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance has subpoenaed Trump's tax returns, though Trump is fighting the subpoena in federal court.
Trump, meanwhile, has repeatedly lamented the decline of upstate New York from its industrial heyday, telling reporters in February that upstate residents should consider moving.
"If New York isn't gonna treat them better, I would recommend they go to another state where they can get a great job," Trump said.
In his tweets Thursday, Trump said his shifting residency "will be best for all concerned."
"As President, I will always be there to help New York and the great people of New York," Trump wrote. "It will always have a special place in my heart!"

Texto completo: Following his breakout debate performance, presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg has surged into striking distance of a win in Iowa, putting up his best showing in recent polls in the state with the first nominating contest.
In a New York Times/Siena College poll released Friday morning, the mayor of South Bend is polling at 18%, behind Elizabeth Warren at 22% and Bernie Sanders at 19%. He edged out Joe Biden, who entered the race at the top of the polls in Iowa, but slipped to fourth place at 17%.
The poll has a margin of error of 4.7%, meaning the race remains tight, with the top three in a statistical tie. The remaining candidates are polling at 4% or less.
In some ways it's no surprise. Pundits think Buttigieg is positioned to contend in mostly white Iowa and New Hampshire, but caution his continuing struggle in South Carolina, a state with a larger African American population, might be more noteworthy.
"He's bound to do well in Iowa," said Larry Sabato, a political science professor at the University of Virginia. "He's Midwestern and Iowa is 90 percent white. I'm still very skeptical that he can go on to win the nomination (given his lack of support among African Americans). I just don't see how he does it."
Buttigieg has had a sometimes bumpy relationship with African Americans in South Bend, most recently thrust into the spotlight when a white police officer shot a black man wielding a knife this summer.
It's not his only obstacle. Acceptance of marriage equality and LGBTQ rights among African Americans and Latinos is growing, but isn't as high as among other groups, a potential problem for the first openly gay Democratic candidate for president.
Still, pundits say a win in Iowa would give him more time to win over those voters. And if Biden continues to stumble, many might be looking for a more moderate candidate than Warren and Sanders, a point Buttigieg reinforced again and again at the October debate.
"If he can be successful in Iowa and in New Hampshire that gives him more time and opportunity to really reach out to voters and try to get them on his side," said Laura Merrifield Wilson, assistant professor of political science at the University of Indianapolis.
In fact, the national takeaway from the recent polls has been the continuing collapse of Biden, pundits say, which is leaving the door open for other candidates like Buttigieg.
"Biden is now, I think you can make an argument that he's out in Iowa and New Hampshire," Sabato said. "That ought to be a concern for him, though he has a chance to recover in South Carolina (where he remains popular with African American voters)."
The poll had more good news for Buttigieg, who has been positioning himself as a moderate alternative to the former vice president. The South Bend mayor is the second choice of 31% of caucus goers, behind only Sanders at 34%.
Buttigieg fared somewhat better with older voters than younger voters, according to the poll.
There was some bad news for him, too. Among the top four candidates, voters were the least confident in his chances of defeating President Donald Trump, at 70%. Warren was at 81%, Biden at 80% and Sanders at 76%.
The poll of 439 Iowa Democratic caucus goers was conducted Oct. 25-30.
Buttigieg has been a leader in collecting campaign money, and he appears to be putting it to good use, said Andy Downs, director of the Mike Downs Center for Indiana Politics.
"It's being put to work in Iowa and in New Hampshire and in South Carolina and we'll see if the same sort of thing can happen (elsewhere)," Downs said.
The survey comes just a week after Buttigieg polled at 20% in the latest Iowa State University/Civiqs poll, behind only Warren at 28%.
Sanders was at 18% and Biden at 12% in that poll of 598 likely Democratic caucus attendees surveyed between October 18-22. The margin of error was 5%.
Buttigieg moved up from fourth place in the same poll in September.
There was trouble for the mayor in this poll, too, foreshadowing his issues in more diverse states.
Among non white voters in Iowa, Buttigieg was at fifth place at 9%, behind Biden, Warrem, Sanders and Kamala Harris. The mayor also ranked poorly as a second choice, ranking behind Warren, Sanders and Tulsi Gabbard.

Texto completo: Rico knows even more than her mother about how to make ends meet.
Grocery shopping happens strictly from a list that relies mainly on store brands. Most of her wardrobe is from Goodwill or off-price retailers. And she’s resigned to working most days at a convenience store because she knows the extra pay is crucial to supplement what her single mom makes as a Hilton housekeeper.
A teenager can dream, though. So when she sells a handful of lottery tickets on Christmas Eve, she imagines all the things she could do with that money. And when it turns out that two of the winning tickets came from her Gas ’n’ Go, she goes even further.
In “Jackpot” (Crown/Random House, $17.99), Nic Stone plumbs the thorny topics of wealth and class through Rico, a high school senior who’s wise beyond her years because she has to be. Stone, whose debut, “Dear Martin,” was a New York Times bestseller and “Odd One Out” was named one of NPR’s best books of the year, knows how to marry issues and storytelling in a way that’s compelling instead of preachy.
So when Rico conscripts fellow senior and reported genius hacker Zan to help her
decode security footage from the night she sold the winning tickets, the two start a relationship both informed and hampered by their respective backgrounds.
Rico sees Zan as little more than a convenient (and kind of cute) tool to achieve her goals. His father owns his own business, he drives a tricked-out Jeep and he lives in a McMansion in suburban Atlanta. She’s both resentful and incredulous at his privilege. She can’t believe it when he tells her he won’t be going to college next year.
“’So where were the offers from?’ Rico pushes when Zan dances around the topic. ’Can’t be that bad.’
“He sighs. ‘Duke, Stanford and Notre Dame.’ …
“‘And you’re not going?’
“‘Nope.’ He shrugs. ‘College isn’t for everyone, you know.’ …
“(H)e doesn’t sound convinced, but I decide not to push. Especially since I’m (uncontrollably) crunchy now. To have all that presented to you on a diamond-encrusted platinum platter for the taking and you just … decide not to? Seems so wasteful.”
Zan’s backstory is more complicated than Rico realizes, though, and how the two find common ground as they hunt for the winning ticket holder is a refreshing departure from the typical “opposites attract” teen romance scenario. These two are clearly attracted to each other, but their frank discussions of parental and societal expectations around success and money resonate.
Yet while the issues at hand are serious, Stone doesn’t shy away from some welcome humor. She intersperses chapters narrated from the perspective of key bits of paper — money, wish lists, and even the missing lottery ticket: “It’s not easy being an inanimate object worth enough American dollars to feed a family of six in Chad for over forty thousand years. … Right now, that dastardly George Washington has his ugly green face smashed against mine, and there’s a month-old Chick-Fil-A receipt pressed against my behind without my consent.”
She also doesn’t shy away from hope. Though “Jackpot” at times is heartbreaking in the trials Rico must endure, ultimately it rewards both its teenage protagonist and the reader with a path forward. (Ages 14 and older)
The book festival season may be over, but authors continue to stream through Austin this month. Standouts include Austin’s Cate Berry (“Penguin and Tiny Shrimp Don’t Do Bedtime!”), who makes it fun to count forward and backward with her new picture book “Chicken Break” (Feiwel and Friends, $17.99). She’ll be at BookPeople at 2 p.m. Nov. 3. … “The Diary of a Wimpy Kid” author Jeff Kinney will be in Austin on Nov. 5 to celebrate the 14th title in that series, “Wrecking Ball.” BookPeople, the Leander Independent School District and Hill Country Bible Church have put together this event, 6 p.m. Nov. 5, Hill Country Bible Church, 12124 RM 620 N. Go to bookpeople.com to get your ticket, which is the cost of a book. ... Jon Klassen’s trio of “Hat” books, including the Caldecott-winning “This Is Not My Hat,” comprise the new hardback boxed set “Jon Klassen’s Hat Box” (Candlewick, $49.99), which also includes a frameable print. Klassen comes to BookPeople at 6 p.m. Nov. 5. ... Netflix’s reboot of “Queer Eye” won accolades for its empowering discussions along with its makeovers. The show’s culture expert, Karamo Brown, keeps the inspiration coming in a new picture book, “I Am Perfectly Designed” (Holt, $18.99). Written with his son Jason “Rachel” Brown, the book celebrates different kinds of families, underscoring the theme of being perfect just the way you are. Both Browns will be at BookPeople at 6:30 p.m. Nov. 7. … All events are free, but you must buy a book at the store in order to get it signed. Visit bookpeople.com/event for more information.

Democrats should be nervous about Trump's 2020 plan

Texto completo: President Trump's campaign ad that unexpectedly aired on Wednesday during Game 7 of the World Series should worry Democrats. In 30 seconds, it effectively made the argument that could reelect him - "Trump: Not Perfect, Just Better."
Trump's ad starts by reciting the most important accomplishments of his first term. It touted the hot labor market, arguing that his administration has created "6 million new jobs" and "500,000 new manufacturing jobs." It then turned to immigration, contending he has "cut illegal immigration in half" and "obliterated ISIS," noting the death of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. This short synopsis hit the things his voters care about, as polls generally show that Trump gets relatively high marks for his management of the economy and that Republicans have long ranked immigration and terrorism as two of their top issues.
It then turns to Democrats, displaying pictures of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (Calif.). The ad's narrator castigates them for focusing on impeachment and "phony investigations" rather than addressing "the real issues." It concludes by returning to Trump, saying Democrats aren't stopping him. It ends with the line that shows an unusual degree of self-awareness for the famously bombastic Trump: "He's no Mister Nice Guy, but sometimes it takes a Donald Trump to change Washington."
The ad's effectiveness was immediately noted by some leading Democrats. David Plouffe, one of former president Barack Obama's top campaign gurus, even tweeted that the ad was "quite strong." It's always a good sign when even your opponents say your punch landed.
The closing line is the key to the ad's effectiveness. It turns Trump's biggest negative - himself - into a positive. Yes, he's a (insert derogatory term here), but he's our (derogatory term). His blunt toughness, the campaign will argue, is exactly what the country needs as he forces Washington to change against its will. Conservative writer Victor Davis Hanson has been making this argument for years, analogizing Trump to the gunfighter in a movie Western who the town knows is unsavory but who has the tools to clean it up. The fact that the campaign is now making it shows that staffers know they need to make lemonade out of the lemons Trump has given them.
This campaign will grow only sharper as Democrats push impeachment and investigation in Washington while their primary season descends into bitter warfare. Assuming the job market stays strong and the country remains untouched by terrorism, Trump will simply strengthen the contrast between his accomplishments and the unruly mob he is fighting. Once a nominee is selected, Trump will run a classic fear campaign to demonize his opponent as a dangerous person whose election the United States cannot risk. As long as he keeps noting that he's not perfect, his argument that he's just better could easily resonate with people open to voting for him.
Trump opponents will howl, but they're not the president's target audience. He knows that nearly half the country will never vote for him, and so he makes no concession to their views. Instead, he is ruthlessly focusing on improving turnout among his backers while directly talking to the 5 to 10 percent of the electorate whose votes will decide the election. Those people - Americans who disapprove of Trump and still are leery about impeachment - could decide that the devil they know is better than the devil they don't.
A recent set of polls showed how crucial this group is. Sponsored by Siena College and the New York Times, these polls showed a majority of voters in six key battleground states backed an impeachment inquiry but oppose Trump's removal. This was the case in every state surveyed, even in Democratic-leaning states such as Michigan and Pennsylvania. Trump's task is to persuade these voters to continue to oppose removal and then transform that belief into eventual support.
Acknowledging his flaws, even obliquely, is the key element in this effort. Don't be surprised if the president continues to do this in carefully scripted interviews with fans such as Fox News's Sean Hannity and makes a mea culpa part of his rally stump talk. Coupling that with a sustained effort to focus on issues and calls for cooperation after his inevitable acquittal by the Senate could easily turn the tables on the Democrats and Trump-haters who think they finally caught their prey.
Good pitchers know how to set up batters for the strikeout, showing them one pitch repeatedly before offering up a pitch they can't handle. Trump's confrontational approach has habituated Democrats into expecting constant insults and hardball tweets. If he now gives them the political equivalent of a change-up, don't be shocked when they swing, miss and mutter angrily to themselves as they head back to the dugout in failure.

Texto completo: Dr. Ibram X. Kendi - author of "How To Be An Antiracist" - drew a standing-room-only crowd of 300-plus to the National Civil Rights Museum Wednesday evening.
A New York Times best-selling author, Kendi is a historian, college professor, magazine columnist and frequent television commentator. His book, "Stamped From the Beginning," won the National Book Award in 2016, making him - at 34 - the youngest winner of the award for nonfiction.
On tour promoting "How To Be An Antiracist," Kendi is becoming synonymous with the term antiracist, which is a new word for some. It is defined as beliefs, actions, movements and policies adopted or developed to oppose racism.
Kendi says society has focused on the intent rather than the outcome. Consider this: When people say or do something offensive, they often try to context it with, "I didn't mean it that way. I'm not racist".
Or, to quote President Donald Trump, "I don't have a racist bone in my body."
While we we don't know about the president's bones, the outcome of his policies contribute to inequity, and that is a racist policy, which is nothing new, Kendi said.
Slaveholders said they were not racist, instead picturing themselves as following God's law and "civilizing" the Africans.
Jim Crow practitioners said they were not racist, arguing that separate but equal was fair and that things were peaceful until "outside agitators" started stirring things up.
Some have interpreted antiracist as anti-white and in doing so they are missing a key element of Kendi's focus. Racist ideas, he said, make black people think less of themselves and make white people think more of themselves.
Many times, Black people's racist ideas are aimed at Black people.
"The only thing wrong with Black people, is that we think something is wrong with black people," Kendi said.
For a point of reference, Kendi referred to the outrageous casting call for the movie, "Straight Outta Compton" produced by Ice Cube, Dr. Dre and Eazy E's widow.
"A" girls: the hottest of the hottest.... any race, but must have natural hair. "B" girl: "...should be light-skinned. ... long natural hair only. Beyonc� is a prototype. "C" GIRLS: African American girls, medium to light-skinned with a weave. "D" GIRLS:... African American girls. Poor, not in good shape. Medium to dark-skin tone."
A perfect example of how not to post a job.
In "How To Be An Anti-racist" Kendi discusses how color, geography, class, culture and other factors impact our perceptions of others. He supported his comments with data.
For instance, if black people are more violent, as some say, all majority black neighborhoods would be high-crime areas. However, it's poor, black neighborhoods with high levels of long-term unemployment that have high crime rates. This suggests that poverty and unemployment are the issue, not the race of the residents.
Kendi asserts that there are not "bad people, but bad policy." He cites a study that noted a 43 percent drop in violent crime arrests for black youths that participated in a summer job program in Chicago. Blaming the residents, allows us to say the situation can't be changed, and accept the status quo. If we tackle the real cause, then we can make progress.
So how do we become antiracist?
Not by saying, "I'm not racist." That is not enough. Just as important as the outcome of one's actions is the outcome from inaction. Inaction is a choice. So if there is a policy, law or guideline that leads to inequity and you do nothing, you are basically saying you are OK with that policy, law or guideline.
"Being an antiracist requires persistent self-awareness, constant self-criticism, and regular self-examination."
Sharing his recent cancer diagnosis, Kendi likened racism to a cancer. The longer you ignore the symptoms, the harder it is to treat and the more severe the illness. You can't get cured if you don't accept the diagnosis and begin treatment.

Looming Senate impeachment trial throws wrench in Democratic presidential campaign plans

Texto completo: With House impeachment proceedings taking longer than initially projected, a looming Senate trial poses a challenge to presidential candidates. Those who are senators may have to spend time away from the campaign trail as a trial intersects with primary contests, and candidates not in the Senate will have to break through a heightened focus on impeachment.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi indicated in September that impeachment proceedings would move "expeditiously,” with some hoping to vote on impeachment articles by Thanksgiving. But Democrats have not announced a timeline for the process and have not yet scheduled public hearings, which are expected before a vote on articles of impeachment.
The delay in the House could mean that the Senate will begin a trial to consider the articles around the time of the first state primary contests, forcing senators vying for the nomination to stay in Washington, D.C., rather than campaign in key states. The Iowa caucuses are Feb. 3, and the New Hampshire primary is Feb. 11.
Six senators remain in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination: Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Elizabeth Warren in Massachusetts, Kamala Harris of California, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, and Michael Bennet of Colorado.
Republican Louisiana Sen. John Kennedy on Wednesday suggested that a Senate trial intersecting with the primary campaign is by design.
“Maybe it’s a coincidence, but I don’t believe in coincidences up here,” Kennedy said on Fox News. “Who does that help?”
When asked if he thinks that the situation would help Joe Biden, Kennedy responded, “Amen, brother.”
“I’m not accusing anybody of anything. I’m just saying it’s been my experience up here, there are very few coincidences,” Kennedy added. “All of them will be in the Senate six days a week, most of the day, Monday through Saturday. Now, you don’t have to be MENSA material to figure out who that helps.”
South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who has been inching up to fourth place behind Biden, Warren, and Sanders in most recent state and national primary polls, would also be uninhibited from campaigning during Senate proceedings around the time of the primaries.
A trial around the primaries, however, could also be an advantage for the senators seeking the nomination as national attention is focused on impeachment rather than policy proposals.
“Even among Iowa Democrats, they're going to be focused on the trial in Washington, and I think the actual campaigning in Iowa will be a sideshow,” Democratic strategist Brad Bannon told the Washington Examiner, noting that the top priority of most Democratic primary voters is replacing President Trump. “The senators have more opportunity to score points and be in the limelight than the candidates who aren’t senators," Bannon said.
Harris and Klobuchar built their national profile during Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court confirmation hearing last year when Harris grilled Kavanaugh on the Mueller investigation, and Kavanaugh asked Klobuchar if she had ever been blackout drunk.
While the senators under current rules would not be able to speak during the trial when they act as jurors, they could make comments to reporters and the press.
Jim Manley, another Democratic strategist, warned that the senators "need to be a little bit careful" and make an effort to appear neutral since they will be jurors in a Senate trial. "They need to avoid the presidential campaign aspect of the process. They got to focus on this job," he told the Washington Examiner.
Manley agreed that while candidates like Biden and Buttigieg "have the luxury of continuing to meet with them [voters] while the senators are stuck in Washington," it wouldn't be detrimental to the senators' campaigns.

"Throughout this process, the whole political world is going to be focused on what's going on in the United States Capitol," Manley said. "There's ways to get around it, maybe a conference call to a rally or something like that, but I think on the by and by, their focus needs to be on the job at hand."
The senators running for president have stressed that their responsibilities to attend an impeachment trial outweigh their presidential campaigns.
“Some things are more important than politics,” Warren said on Tuesday. “We have a responsibility here, and it's not something that I take any pleasure in, but it's something that has to be done. So I'll be there."
“You really have to let the chips fall where they may," Klobuchar told HuffPost last week. "This is our constitutional duty. If the trial is in January, if the trial is in February, we’re going to have to be here."

Let's be honest about public financing

Texto completo: A state commission is in the process of designing a system for public financing of state campaigns. As Gov. Cuomo rightly said, the process has turned into politics on steroids, with everyone jockeying for their own political advantage.
Existing political parties want to preserve themselves and exclude others; aspiring parties want more access to public funds. As Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan said, "Everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but not to his own facts." Here are the facts that shouldn't get lost in the hysteria playing out on Twitter and in the Capitol.
First, polling shows you that public financing of campaigns is unpopular among the electorate, but favored by some good government groups and political organizations that could increase their power.
Second, if done incorrectly, public financing could become prohibitively expensive. The number of statewide parties fluctuates every cycle; currently there are seven parties and 213 state legislative seats that could be eligible for taxpayer funding. If there were primaries on each line, could make over 1,000 races per cycle eligible for public funding. The cost could be in the hundreds of millions, making the program economically impossible.
Third, if precautions are not taken, organizations could manipulate public financing into a business opportunity. All they would need to do is gather signatures to meet the low threshold create a party and get access to matching funds.
Should taxpayers really foot the bill for someone to run on parties that have qualified under existing rules, like the Stop Common Core or the Serve America Movement party?
Fourth, for many years, reformers have tried to end fusion voting where small parties broker their party's endorsement for political benefit. Publications from the New York Times to Newsday have long been against fusion voting, which exists in only nine states.
Endorsements on these minor lines are often based on petty politics - not ideology.
If the Conservative Party and the Working Families Party truly are ideologically driven, how is it possible both gave their line to the same candidate in this year's Nassau district attorney race?
The old Liberal Party is also a classic example of this. As the saying went: The Liberal Party is neither liberal nor a party. It was an exploitative control mechanism for political power.
Legislators who criticize the commission's process as undemocratic are disingenuous. The Legislature approved the process by which the commission was set up - they read the law and voted to adopt it. Further, any final commission recommendations will require support from both the Senate and Assembly appointees.
Legislators have a second veto, as they could come back to Albany in December and overturn the commission's work.
The current debate seems not about principle, but about political advantage. The WFP decries other existing smaller parties, bristling at competition.
The Conservative Party is also an existing party, and they too want their status and power protected.
Incredibly, the WFP and the Conservatives joined together to stop reforms in the courts and secure their leverage. Ironically, they judge-shopped, filing joint suits in a western New York court where a judge first accepted the case and then was subsequently forced to recuse himself after acting inappropriately. This same judge's wife happened to have spent time serving as chairperson of the Independence Party, another existing statewide party.
Meantime, the commission is contemplating limiting the public matching funds to inside a candidate's district. That's a perfectly sound idea, but some statewide "progressive" organizations are balking; they want public funds to match small contributions coming from anywhere in New York. If they prevail, Manhattan millionaires could dominate financing in an election in the South Bronx. So much for empowering lower-income New Yorkers and communities of color.
On the other hand, community organizations in election districts want matching funds from inside the district to maximize their grassroots advantage and stop outside richer donors. Each argues its self-interest.
Our public financing conversation has become about power and money. Let's be guided by objective analysis rather than political self-interest. These results could either improve our system or set us back decades.

I'm not a perfectionist: Why I still love Facebook OP-ED

Texto completo: Have you heard that Facebook's new "News" feature is going to include Breitbart, right alongside (with an emphasis on "right") news sources such as The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal?
I don't like the idea of Breitbart enjoying the same space as those most respectable news sources. But I'm not a perfectionist. Unlike many folks I know, I'm staying on Facebook despite the fact that Facebook's CEO Mark Zuckerberg is making choices I wouldn't make.
Zuckerberg is selling a product I enjoy. In the same way that ethical vegetarians can occasionally dine out with friends at restaurants serving hamburger despite their deeply held personal belief that meat-eating is reprehensible, I'm keeping my Facebook page while keeping my distaste for Zuckerberg's decisions intact.
So I won't pay attention to Breitbart on Facebook, just as I don't pay attention to it now.
I suspect I like Facebook precisely because ever since I was a kid, I've thought of the world as full of potential pen pals.
But now I don't have to wait for weeks to hear what they have to say.
Ray Oldenburg is a sociologist who developed the concept of a "Third Place," a public arena where individuals gather to make friends, relax and be their authentic selves. The Third Place, in terms of significance in our lives, comes right after home and the workplace. Oldenburg argues that virtual spaces can't be Third Places; He sees hair salons, coffee shops and, one presumes, the bar in "Cheers" as the physical setting for encounters that provide neutral ground, where social status doesn't matter, where the central activity is conversation and where everybody knows your name.
For me, Facebook does that. It's as close as I can get to throwing around a Frisbee, in the days before it became Ultimate. You'd throw it to a friend and wonder if they'd send it back to you or flick it in someone else's direction or miss it all together. I do that now on my page, except I throw around ideas, lines from books, bits of poems, links to articles and the occasional photograph.
Some go astray, and others dive straight into the earth like a dart. But a few get caught and begin long, wild flights, passing through many hands. These are as much fun as endless games in the park, talks late into the night or any connection of disparate individuals willing to engage in an exchange of stories.
I asked the experts - my own friends on Facebook - why they're on the page. "It's my lifeline to friends and a built-in audience," is Amy Hartl Sherman's answer. I met Amy at the Erma Bombeck Writer's Workshop several years ago, but we've become friends through trading unladylike responses to world events (she doesn't like Breitbart either) and personal matters (both of us deal with feral creatures in our yards; she videotapes hers).
Nanci McBrearty Pelati says she uses Facebook "to see what the parts that make me whole are up to," while Jane Smiley (Pulitzer-Prize winning author and, yes, my FB friend) says she uses it as follows: "Eavesdropping. Introvert connecting. Too tall for parties."
I've been comforted, cheered and reassured by responses on Facebook at times when I needed them. Others rely on it as well, especially those like Mary Lou H. Solomon, who describes herself as "being very social but sometimes an introvert" and discovered that Facebook allows her to be both.
Those who are self-defined introverts or wary of social interaction or whose circumstances limit their access to in-person conversation can find an oddly personal solace in a virtual space.
The clarity and honesty of Christina Smith's admission that her friends on Facebook "keep the loneliness at bay" is echoed by Jamie Spriggs' comment that Facebook can act as a "caregiver's lifeline to the outside world. It also provides a welcome distraction from whatever I don't want to be doing."
And although Nancy Hanlon O'Connell's response that she goes to FB for "Distraction, Obsession, Compulsion" makes Zuckerberg's creation sound like a series of Calvin Klein's perfumes, I understand her point.
I've never looked to Facebook for my news; for that I rely on newspapers. I rely on journalists and members of the Fourth Estate for information, discovery and evidence. Like the rest of America, I depend on a free press.
So while I don't depend on Facebook, I like the place, and even with interlopers like Breitbart milling about, I'll choose the company I keep.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump has repeatedly slammed the secret impeachment hearings in the Capitol basement as "a totally compromised kangaroo court." Sounds like Speaker Nancy Pelosi got the message.
On Monday, she announced the full House would vote to formally launch impeachment proceedings, which will be out in the open instead of in the dark.
Democrats have been trying to trick the public into believing they've got the goods. But none of the witnesses they've called have had any firsthand knowledge of presidential wrongdoing.
Behind closed doors and with no press allowed, House Democrats have tried to put on the appearance of a legal proceeding. At the end of each session, they leak to the press what they claim happened. The media are all too willing to play along. "Powerful testimony from multiple state and national security officials," the Hill reports, adding up to a "scathing picture of Trump and his allies withholding nearly $400 million in security aid from Ukraine."
Politico called Ukrainian Ambassador Bill Taylor's testimony "explosive," though Taylor's
prepared statement merely regurgitated what other State Department minions had told him. His source was the rumor mill.
The New York Times reports "a rapidly moving investigation securing damning testimony." That's hardly the case, but soon the jig will be up. Regardless of how many "witnesses" the Dems parade into the Capitol hearing, it won't matter if they have no firsthand knowledge.
Even the Times concedes that to impeach a president, the House needs proof "tying him directly" to wrongdoing.
Before Pelosi's announcement Monday, House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, who's overseeing the secret hearings, gave up on calling witnesses who have direct, firsthand working relationships with Trump and can attest to what the president has said and done.
Schiff caved after a key witness actually challenged the committee's subpoena. Charles Kupperman, former deputy national security adviser - and one of the few people who was on Trump's call with the Ukrainian president - filed a lawsuit, arguing that the House committee can't compel testimony for an impeachment until the full House has voted to authorize subpoenas for that purpose. That, of course, is the vote Pelosi was dodging.
"We are not willing to allow the White House to engage us in a lengthy game of rope-a-dope with the courts," Schiff said.
Translation: Dems don't think they'd win in the highest court.
They also don't want to risk dragging the inquiry on for months. After all, without
evidence of grave wrongdoing, the Republican-controlled Senate won't remove this president from office.
Schiff's cynical decision not to meet Kupperman in court indicates he's also not going to press for testimony from Mike Pompeo or Rick Perry - advisers who know the facts. Additional witnesses are scheduled to appear before Schiff's committee later this week. But they'll likely offer more of the same, predicts Mark Meadows, a Republican Intelligence Committee member witnessing the charade.
Trump released the transcript of his July 25 call with the Ukrainian president. Democrats and their media allies say the call is damning evidence of a quid pro quo. All you have to do to see that's false is read the words yourself.
The public's not stupid, and Pelosi is a far better politician than Schiff. Polls show fewer than half of voters support impeachment in swing states such as Wisconsin, Florida, Pennsylvania and Michigan. These are states Trump won in 2016 and Pelosi has been reluctant to put Democrats from them on the spot. Trump's called her bluff. Now the Democrats will have to put up or shut up.

Texto completo: Readers express disappointment in the partisanship that marked the vote and urge Democrats to "throw the book at Donald Trump."
To the Editor:
Re "A Divided House Endorses Impeachment Inquiry Into Trump" (nytimes.com, Oct. 31):
It is a sad day for American democracy when not one Republican voted to authorize the public impeachment inquiry. The resolution was fair and gave Republicans all they demanded: open hearings, the right to subpoena witnesses and due process for the president, consistent with past impeachment proceedings.
That few would dare to vote their conscience -- I'm assuming that some Republicans in Congress still have a conscience -- is not a surprise given their fear of President Trump and his base. But not even Representative Francis Rooney, who is retiring and had said publicly that he was open to impeachment, voted in favor of the resolution.
It is now really up to the American people. They must tell their Republican representatives that they are disappointed if not outraged that they wouldn't even endorse this public and fair inquiry. For the good of this country, this cannot remain a partisan matter.
Ronald L. Hirsch
Great Barrington, Mass.
To the Editor:
The current impeachment proceedings are not just about President Trump. The proceedings will define how future presidents lead and preserve our democracy. Democracy is based on laws. If future presidents, whether Democratic, Republican, Libertarian or independent, define their own laws, democracy is at risk.
Partisan beliefs have no place in this determination. The message to Congress: Your job is to protect our long-term democracy, not any political party for short-term gain.
As the impeachment process proceeds, may all rise above partisanship, evaluate the facts and make the right long-term decision for our country. This is about more than President Trump.

To the Editor:
This country was founded because it wanted to be rid of a king. Now we have a king, one who combines the worst qualities of Don Rickles and Don Corleone and who, if he isn't in the pay of Russia, might as well be.
The gutless Republicans led by Mitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham have allowed the president everything short of nullifying the Constitution by executive order -- though probably they'd let that pass as well.
Ukraine won't be enough for impeachment. The Democrats have to throw the book at Donald Trump to make him seem absolutely, utterly, finally indefensible. Of course, he's that already. But only a full on-camera public litany of his depredations can do the job.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — House impeachment investigators on Wednesday summoned John Bolton, President Trump's former national security adviser, and two top White House lawyers to testify next week in their inquiry into Trump's pressure campaign on Ukraine, closing in on critical witnesses as they prepare to go public with their investigation.
Bolton, a fiery foreign policy veteran, could be a marquee player in the House's month-old impeachment inquiry. His deputies have testified that Bolton, who left the White House in September amid disagreements with the president, was angry about the efforts to pressure Ukraine to open investigations into Democrats. Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer who was leading the charge, he warned, was a “hand grenade who's going to blow everybody up."
But his appearance is far from assured. His lawyer said that Bolton was “not willing to appear voluntarily," declining to specify what his client would do should he be subpoenaed.
The much-anticipated invitation punctuated another hectic day in Washington, where talk of impeachment and the shadow diplomatic efforts at the heart of the case consumed the capital. A confirmation hearing for John Sullivan, the deputy secretary of state who is Trump's nominee to be the ambassador to Russia, was dominated by questions about the Ukraine affair.
Under oath and on camera, Sullivan confirmed publicly for the first time that Giuliani was involved in a smear campaign to oust the ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, and made it clear that he did not believe the president's quest to enlist Ukraine's political help was proper.
“I don't think that would be in accord with our values," he said, when asked whether it was appropriate for the president to demand investigations into domestic political opponents.
Tim Morrison, a Europe and Russia expert on the National Security Council, resigned from his post on the eve of his scheduled testimony before impeachment investigators. Morrison had been considering leaving for some time, but the timing fueled anticipation that he would offer damaging information about Trump's conduct.
NPR first reported his plans.
As the private phase of the inquiry marched forward, the House prepared for its first formal vote Thursday related to the inquiry, as Democrats lay out rules to begin taking their impeachment process public.
There was no doubt that the Democratic-controlled body would approve the eight pages of procedures on Thursday.
"As much as this president flaunts the Constitution, we are going to protect it," House Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern, Democrat of Worcester, said as his panel debated the procedures Wednesday.
And details continued to trickle out from the closed-door depositions that have been fueling the investigation. Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, the top Ukraine expert at the National Security Council, told investigators Tuesday that Ukrainian officials had complained to him about Giuliani and his demands for investigations. He went so far as to warn Volodymyr Zelensky as he was being sworn in as the president of Ukraine, according to people familiar with his testimony. During a May meeting in Ukraine to mark Zelensky's inauguration, the colonel advised him to try to avoid becoming ensnared in politics in the United States.
In addition to Bolton, House investigators sent requests Wednesday to two senior White House lawyers implicated in the case, John Eisenberg and Michael Ellis, who could offer important insight into the events under scrutiny.
Eisenberg fielded concerns from Bolton's deputies about apparent demands being placed on Ukraine and helped move a transcript of a now-famous July phone call between Trump and Ukraine's leader into a secure server that limited who could see it.
Many Democrats regard Bolton as the perfect witness, a respected conservative national security hawk who was nonetheless incensed by how the president and his inner circle were treating Ukraine, and who broke sharply with the president upon his departure from the White House.
If Bolton is subpoenaed, his lawyer, Charles J. Cooper, is likely to ask a federal judge to determine whether his client needs to comply.
Cooper, who also represents Bolton's former White House deputy, advised the deputy, Charles Kupperman, not to comply with a subpoena to appear this week after the White House intervened. Instead, he filed a lawsuit asking a federal judge whether he should testify in the impeachment inquiry.
A hearing on that matter is scheduled for Thursday at the US District Court in Washington. Bolton could take a similar course.
Eisenberg and Ellis could face similar decisions about whether to satisfy the White House directives or congressional demands.
As White House lawyers, they could also be subject to certain special privilege claims to shield their testimony from Congress.
On Wednesday, Democratic and Republican investigators privately questioned two more witnesses, both foreign service officers who worked closely on Ukraine policy at the White House, advising Kurt Volker, the former US special envoy to that country.
They offered additional information about concerns about Giuliani's role among some senior administration officials, including Bolton, and gave intriguing new details about a campaign to smear Yovanovitch.
One of them testified that Robert Livingston, a former Republican congressman turned lobbyist, repeatedly told her when she was assigned to the White House that the ambassador should be fired because of her association with Democrats.
The officer, Catherine Croft, testified that she “documented" multiple calls from Livingston about Yovanovitch while she was working at the National Security Council from mid-2017 to mid-2018. She said that she informed two other officials — Fiona Hill, then the senior director for Europe and Russia at the council, and George P. Kent, a Ukraine expert at the State Department — about them at the time.
“He characterized Ambassador Yovanovitch as an 'Obama holdover' and associated with George Soros," she said, referring to the billionaire liberal philanthropist, according to a copy of Croft's opening statement reviewed by The New York Times. “It was not clear to me at the time — or now — at whose direction or at whose expense Mr. Livingston was seeking the removal of Ambassador Yovanovitch."
It is not clear if Livingston's work, or those financing it, were in any way connected to efforts by two Americans with business interests in Ukraine who wanted her gone and, later, by Giuliani. Nor did Croft have anything to say about whom else Livingston spoke with.

Facebook's political ad policy under fire

Texto completo: With the 2020 presidential campaign in full swing, Facebook is taking more heat than usual over its fact-checking policy with regard to political advertising. Earlier this month, news broke that the social network would be taking a hands-off approach when it comes to fact-checking political ads run on the platform.
The news came on the heels of the Trump campaign purchasing a 30-second ad which asserted that former vice president and Democratic candidate Joe Biden offered Ukraine $1 billion in U.S. aid if the country fired the prosecutor who was investigating a company tied to Biden's son, Hunter, according to The New York Times.
While CNN refused to air the ad, asserting that the allegations were false, Facebook did not. The Biden campaign specifically requested that Facebook pull the ad.
"This is a most basic test," Greg Schultz, Biden's campaign manager, wrote in a letter to Facebook. "The ad contains transparently false allegations, prominently debunked by every major media outlet in the country over recent weeks. It should be rejected."
Facebook refused, and out-and-out bedlam ensued.
It was soon discovered — and reported — that Facebook had "quietly rescinded a policy banning false claims in advertising, creating a specific exemption that leaves political adverts unconstrained regarding how they could mislead or deceive," according to a report in The Guardian. The change came just more than a week after Zuckerberg held a closed-door meeting with President Trump.
Last week, Facebook Co-founder Mark Zuckerberg appeared before the House Financial Services Committee to discuss his plans for Libra, a new cryptocurrency of which he is involved in the development. But, under questioning from committee members, testimony quickly turned to Facebook's advertising policy.
Perhaps the sharpest line of questioning came from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the congresswoman from New York.
"Would I be able to run advertisements on Facebook targeting Republicans in primaries saying they voted for the Green New Deal?" Ocasio-Cortez asked Zuckerberg. "I mean, if you're not fact-checking political advertisements, I'm just trying to understand the bounds here."
"I don't know the answer to that off the top of my head," Zuckerberg responded. Then, as Ocasio-Cortez began to move to another question, he added, "I think, probably."
If not reigned in, this is going to spiral dangerously out-of-control. For instance, in response to the recent policy shift, a San Francisco man on Monday morning registered as a candidate in California's 2022 gubernatorial election. According to a CNN report, the candidate — Adriel Hampton — is not hoping to become governor; instead, he wants to "run false Facebook ads of his own."
Dissent is even growing within the ranks of Facebook. The New York Times reported this week that hundreds of Facebook employees have issued an open letter to Zuckerberg, decrying the decision to let politicians run false and misleading ads.
"We want to raise our concerns before it's too late," the employees wrote. "Free speech and paid speech are not the same thing. Misinformation affects us all. Our current policies on fact checking people in political office, or those running for office, are a threat to what FB stands for. We strongly object to this policy as it stands."
Given the widely-accepted understanding of how Facebook was manipulated during the 2016 election — and the immense backlash the company is currently facing — I have to assume that Facebook will reverse course soon. There is simply too much at stake, and indiscriminately dishing up misinformation is detrimental to the democratic process.
It's one thing to, by way of negligence, inadvertently allow outside influencers to slip in through the back door. But to indiscriminately allow candidates, campaigns and political action committees to deliberately mislead voters is simply inexcusable.

Director Greta Gerwig‘s highly anticipated adaptation of Louisa May Alcott’s Little Women is coming out on Christmas Day, which all but guarantees theaters packed with coastal city professionals stuffing sodden tissues back into the pockets of their windbreakers. Gerwig, who cut her teeth as an actress in indie movies before coming into her own as the screenwriter and director of the Academy Award-nominated coming-of-age film Lady Bird , brings an intellectually rigorous approach to her characters that produces both sharp dialogue and heartfelt onscreen relationships. Gerwig applied this analytical nature to Little Women by consulting several paintings during the course of making the film; paintings that illustrated the same post-Civil War period that Alcott’s novel is set during.
According to the New York Times , the paintings that Gerwig favored while structuring Little Women depicted girls from another time with unmistakably modern personalities: young women frowning while preparing meals, frolicking pointedly on barren beaches and greeting the world with frustration and wit. At the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Gerwig points out Eagle Head, Manchester, Massachusetts (High Tide), 1870, by Winslow Homer as one of her specific points of reference. The painting shows three women clustered together on the sand, while one figure glares at the other with a very specific kind of adolescent malice. Gerwig also mentioned The young wife: First stew , 1864–1864, by Lilly Martin Spencer, which depicts a young woman’s amusing revulsion at the contents of a pot, as well as the photographs of Julia Margaret Cameron, a British master who took snapshots of figures bathed in sepia tones.

The thing about Gerwig’s characters that often gets lost when critics marvel over her sparkling writing and sensitive pop culture references is how fundamentally pissed off her creations are, even when they’re bumbling and awkward like the titular modern dancer in Frances Ha . They want more, and for the moment, nothing’s happening but life.

La imagen origina fue cuando se colocó una medalla al veterano James McCloughan .
So apparently Trump, aka THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, shared a photoshopped picture of him giving a medal to a "hero dog." The original photo was of army vet James McCloughan.
So glad to see our president is spending his time wisely. ???? pic.twitter.com/9xKwkZ17A0

Now the Left is going wild because they just figured out… that this photo… is indeed photoshopped.
I wonder how many CNN “fact checkers” it took to figure this one out ??

Texto completo: John Carpenter's formative slasher movie airs on AMC, alongside lots of other creepy Halloween offerings.
What's on TV
HALLOWEEN (1978) 7 p.m. on AMC. "This is an evil that makes no facial expression, doesn't have a voice, moves slowly but kills with a vengeance," Jamie Lee Curtis said in an interview with The New York Times last year, answering a question about why the creepy killer Michael Myers has remained a compelling figure for four decades. This is the original John Carpenter slasher movie that spawned a franchise. "Halloween" introduced both Curtis (it was her film debut) and her character, Laurie Strode, a teenage babysitter who is stalked by the masked psychopath Myers (Nick Castle). "This is a universal terror that you combine with a woman representing everyone," Curtis added, "and you have a recipe for people going to the movie over and over again."
BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA (1992) 5:30 p.m. on BBC America. Francis Ford Coppola delivered a relatively faithful take on Bram Stoker's classic horror novel in this Gothic drama. Gary Oldman plays Dracula, under heavy makeup; the all-star cast also includes Winona Ryder, Keanu Reeves and Anthony Hopkins. This, Vincent Canby wrote in his review for The Times, is a "wild dream of a movie, which looks as if it required a special pact with the Treasury Department to finance."
HOCUS POCUS (1993) 8:50 p.m. on Freeform. Last week, Disney confirmed that a long-rumored new "Hocus Pocus" movie is in development. It was a convenient time to generate renewed conversation about this cult classic and Halloween favorite, which stars Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker and Kathy Najimy as sister witches, and is a good child-friendly option for Thursday night.
GRETA (2019) 11:20 p.m. on HBO. More contemporary scares can be found in this psychological thriller, which stars Chloë Grace Moretz and Isabelle Huppert. Moretz plays Frances McCullen, a newly settled New Yorker who is stalked by an older Brooklynite (Huppert). In his review for The Times, A.O. Scott compared it to "Fatal Attraction," "Single White Female" and "other madwoman-in-the-city movies of the '80s and '90s." "'Greta' updates the genre (people have smartphones now) without improving on it much," he wrote, "though the maniac-mommy twist is an interesting wrinkle, adding a sinister fairy-tale element to the modern setting."
What's Streaming
US (2019) Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. Alfred Hitchcock had Bernard Herrmann's screaming strings; Jordan Peele has "I Got 5 on It." In this well-regarded follow-up to "Get Out," Peele turned that 1995 hit by the Bay Area rap duo Luniz into the creepy sonic backdrop of a story set in Northern California, where a family is stalked by its psychotic doppelgängers.
SWEENEY TODD: THE DEMON BARBER OF FLEET STREET (1982) Stream on BroadwayHD. For Halloween-appropriate programming with even more singalong potential, consider this filmed version of the original United States touring production of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's bloody meat-pie musical, with Angela Lansbury as the charmingly evil Mrs. Lovett and George Hearn in the title role. For those looking to limit their candy intake on Thursday night, this can also double as a useful appetite killer.

Texto completo: It's D-Day for Barneys New York -- and, potentially, the entire high fashion retail world.
On Thursday, a bankruptcy court judge in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., is expected to rule on the fate of the famed retailer. It's a decision that could have repercussions far from the corner of 61st and Madison in Manhattan -- and not just because Barneys' flagship store may well disappear if Authentic Brands Group, which last week announced its bid had been accepted, is officially anointed the new owner.
Authentic Brands' plan involves potentially untying the intellectual property of Barneys -- its name and brands -- from its assets. That means the Barneys name would be licensed to Saks Fifth Avenue and the retailer's inventory would be handed over to B. Riley, the financial firm with a robust liquidation business. All of its stores could close.
If the $ 271 million bid from Authentic Brands and B. Riley is approved on Thursday, the result could be eye-popping liquidation sales of luxury goods like handbags and dresses at all seven Barneys locations, perhaps starting as soon as this weekend. That would put a surfeit of discounted merchandise in the major fashion markets of New York and Los Angeles just as the holiday shopping season arrives -- and long before other stores and brands put similar goods on sale.
"It will affect everyone, even online; Net-a-Porter, Saks, Neiman Marcus," said Robert Burke, founder of a luxury consultancy and former fashion director of Bergdorf Goodman. "It's potential retail mayhem. The only other time we have seen a major liquidation outside of the regular sale season was after 9/11, when no one was shopping and people panicked. It was really a disaster, because the customer never really forgets. And trying to retrain them can take years."
Whether that comes to pass depends on any selection of an alternate bidder, and the possibility that new bidders or information cause the judge to wait to make a decision.
The potential rival to Authentic Brands who has been most public about his intentions is Sam Ben-Avraham, the retail and trade show entrepreneur. He assembled a consortium of investors to offer an alternative to Authentic Brands' plan. With a nostalgia-driven "Save Barneys" campaign and a plan to maintain the flagship stores -- and jobs -- in New York and Beverly Hills, the investor in Kith and creator of a number of trade shows had been trying to position himself as the creative and entrepreneurial alternative to Jamie Salter, the founder and chief executive of Authentic Brands. He had not submitted a qualified bid for Barneys as of Wednesday.
Indeed, the Barneys drama increasingly seemed like the tale of two men: on the one hand, the financial engineer, on the other, the merchant-impresario. (This week, David Jackson of the investment firm Solitaire Partners and former chief executive of Istithmar World, the Dubai-based group that owned Barneys from 2007 to 2012, said he was also planning to bid; his backers include the Saudi company Arabian Oud.)
Online and through press interviews, Mr. Ben-Avraham, 53, had cast Mr. Salter, 56, and Authentic Brands as villains looking to demolish Barneys as a cultural institution. In a petition online, Mr. Ben-Avraham said that turning Barneys into an intellectual property license operation would vanquish the store's "unique identity, its point of view, its cutting edge agenda."
The criticism has put a spotlight on Authentic Brands, which Mr. Salter founded in 2010, and its practice of buying the intellectual property of flailing or bankrupt brands. After a purchase, Authentic's goal is to strike licensing deals with other companies that may want to use the brand name in new products, international collections and elsewhere. That translates to licensing fees and royalty payments for Authentic, which is typically removed from issues tied to stores, employees and inventory.
"Sam really is a merchant," said Mr. Burke, albeit one who goes to Burning Man and works out of a SoHo loft. "He and his team are not corporate, not bankers, not strategists."
Still, there are those who found his strategy -- including a "Save Barneys" Instagram account filled with vintage ads and Barneys appearances in shows like "Sex and the City" -- more romantic than realistic.
Authentic Brands says that its dozens of brands, which include Frederick's of Hollywood, Nine West and the rights tied to celebrity names like Muhammad Ali, generate nearly $ 10 billion in annual retail sales. It also recently expanded into media, with the surprising acquisition of Sports Illustrated. (It licensed the publication's operations to a separate company that cut jobs and sought to shift coverage to a network of bloggers.) The company, which is private, does not disclose how much it receives in sales or income.
"Jamie is incredibly smart, incredibly aggressive, and he rarely loses," said Gerald L. Storch, chief executive of Storch Advisors.
Mr. Salter is from Toronto, where he still lives. He is married and has four sons, all of whom work in different roles at Authentic Brands. He started his retail career in sporting goods sales and marketing in the 1980s.
Mr. Salter earned his reputation for resurrecting brands after helping found Hilco Consumer in 2006 and serving as its chief executive. It was a division of the financial firm Hilco, which has a robust liquidation business.
Hilco Consumer aggressively bought up the intellectual property of brands like Sharper Image, Linens 'n Things and Polaroid through bankruptcy proceedings. New products bearing the brand names, like Sharper Image garment steamers, started appearing at retailers and new websites were introduced.
Mr. Salter views himself as a brand licensing expert, according to a 2009 interview with The New York Times -- one who had learned how to receive royalties for merchandise while bypassing costs like store staff and rent. The strategy has thrived in the churning retail landscape of the past 15 years.
Mr. Salter has his critics, but he also has friends in the fashion industry, including Tommy Hilfiger. Mr. Hilfiger praised the executive's "magic" touch with brands at a conference last year, saying that when Mr. Salter bought something, "the brand basically explodes."
"He licenses it to many different categories, he doesn't own any inventory -- he's like the Uber of the brand business today," Mr. Hilfiger said during a panel discussion, seated next to Mr. Salter.
One of Authentic Brands' earliest coups was the acquisition of exclusive rights tied to Marilyn Monroe, whose likeness drew the interest of everyone from Dolce & Gabbana to Walmart. In 2013, Mr. Salter, as part of a long-running lawsuit around use of the starlet's likeness, described his company's success in expanding Ms. Monroe's brand while staying true to her "DNA" through its partnerships.
"What's really good is Marilyn Monroe is looking down from somewhere seeing that her brand is being exploited properly, to what she wanted," Mr. Salter said in a deposition transcript.
Whether everyone will be happy with his plans to exploit the Barneys brand is another question. "The silver lining is Saks," Mr. Burke said. "I am sure they care," about the potential dangers of liquidation, he said.
As for Barneys stores, even if Authentic Brands keeps some of them open, the inventory will be liquidated, leading to major discounts on luxury goods, according to a person familiar with the plan who was not authorized to speak publicly. Some of the retailer's biggest unsecured creditors include the Row, Balenciaga, Yves Saint Laurent, Gucci and Prada.
Mr. Storch said a liquidation sale before the holidays "would definitely have an impact on the market," even if it's only short term.

Americans' Health Care Preference? It's a 3-Way Tie

Texto completo: Despite the lack of consensus, a new survey finds that almost two-thirds of the public favors Democratic approaches.
When Americans are asked whether they support a "Medicare for all" system that would replace all current insurance with a generous government program, a majority often say yes. But when they're asked follow-up questions, they often reveal that they're not familiar with the details of that plan -- or that they would also be happy with other Democratic policy proposals.
In a new survey from The New York Times as well as the Commonwealth Fund and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, we forced the issue. We asked a panel of 2,005 adults to pick their favorite plan from three choices. One resembled the Medicare for all proposal; one was like more incremental Democratic proposals; and one was like a plan proposed by congressional Republicans, which would reduce federal involvement in the health system and give more money and autonomy to states.
The share of the public supporting each option wound up being almost identical -- around 30 percent each.
That means that most Americans support Democratic approaches to changing the health care system. But that group is about evenly split between an expansive set of changes under the Medicare for all proposal favored by Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, and a less sweeping overhaul that would simply move the country closer to universal coverage, such as those from Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg. (Not every politician's health plan fits neatly in these categories. Kamala Harris, for example, has proposed a system that would eliminate most existing insurance arrangements, but replace them with a system with both public and private coverage options.)
So what are people really saying when they say they like Medicare for all?
They don't like the health system
The group that preferred Medicare for all was more disgruntled with the current system than other groups, and more comfortable with drastic change. Only 21 percent said they thought the United States had the best health care system in the world, compared with 55 percent among those supporting the Republican plan. Majorities of the Medicare for all group said they were dissatisfied with the cost of their health care and worried about their ability to pay if they became ill in the next year. Still, a majority of this group also said they were satisfied with the quality of their care and their current insurance.
Robert Blendon, a professor of health policy and political analysis at the Harvard School of Public Health, who helped write the study, said the overlap between dissatisfaction and support for the proposal showed that Medicare for all's strong supporters understand that it would cause substantial disruption of the current system. Critics have said that the proposal goes too far because it would involve eliminating most private health insurance and could reshuffle the finances of major health care companies.
"There's no question that the level of dissatisfaction leads to interest in big proposals," he said, describing their perspective. "When I'm really dissatisfied, I'm interested in Canada. I want to do big new things."
The Republican proposal would also cause large disruptions in the system, upending the current Medicaid expansion and the markets for people who buy their own insurance. The survey respondents who favored that plan seemed largely satisfied with the status quo. That may be because they do not think those changes will affect them personally. It may also be because a Republican is in the White House now, so the status quo seems rosier to them than it did a few years ago.
They think taxes are a fair trade-off for coverage
Supporters of Medicare for all were more approving of socialism and showed stronger support for the notion that the government should be responsible for ensuring universal access to health care for all Americans. When asked if they were comfortable paying higher taxes in exchange for health coverage for everyone, 79 percent said they would be willing, a substantially higher proportion than respondents in the other two groups.
Those findings suggest that critiques based on the high cost of the proposal probably won't do much to deter its strongest supporters. But the idea of higher taxes was less popular over all. Fifty-three percent of all respondents said they would personally pay more taxes so that everyone could have health care. Only 23 percent of those favoring the Republican plan said they would.
They think the government should play a bigger role
All three groups showed consensus on some points. Large majorities thought the government should require insurers to continue offering coverage to people with pre-existing health conditions. That answer, consistent with some other recent surveys, represents a shift. The Affordable Care Act first provided robust consumer protections for such people, and as recently as two years ago, most Republicans in Congress voted for legislation that would have substantially weakened those protections. Obamacare itself now consistently enjoys majority support in surveys, after years of being under water.
"Protection for people with pre-existing conditions is the status quo, and it can't be taken away except at a huge political cost," said David Blumenthal, the president of the Commonwealth Fund.
There was also relatively broad agreement that health care is a right. When asked whether all Americans should have a right to health care regardless of their ability to pay, nearly 80 percent of all respondents agreed. Sixty percent of those favoring the Republican health plan believed health care was a right, but among those favoring the two Democratic proposals, support exceeded 90 percent.
Where the groups differed was in how a universal health care system should be achieved. Eighty-five percent of the Medicare for all enthusiasts thought it was the responsibility of government to ensure all Americans had health coverage. Only 73 percent of those supporting more incremental Democratic reforms agreed. Among those supporting the Republican plan, the number was 20 percent. Sixty-five percent of people in that group said the government should become less involved in health care in the future.
Will their ranks grow?
On many questions about policy and values, there was broad overlap between the supporters of Medicare for all and supporters of a more incremental approach to coverage expansion. And many survey respondents struggled to express a strong preference between the two choices.
Those factors lead Mr. Blendon to believe there are immediate opportunities for Democrats to devise a plan with broad appeal. The underlying shared values endorsed by supporters of both Democratic approaches -- about rights to health care, protections for the sick, and a larger role for the government in ensuring equity -- could be paired with a more modest set of policy changes.
In the long term, however, the appeal of Medicare for all may hinge on how well the current health care system serves the public. Recent research has found that employer health plans, the most common and popular form of health insurance for working-age Americans, have become substantially less affordable. More Americans are now what experts call "underinsured," meaning that their coverage still leaves them exposed to a damaging financial hit if they get sick. If those trends continue, a greater share of Americans may find themselves dissatisfied with the system and fearful about how it will treat them if they need it.
"Most Americans want everyone to have coverage, but some people are willing to sacrifice more to get there than others," Mr. Blumenthal said. "The people who are willing to sacrifice more are the people who have less to lose."
If the status quo gets bad enough, the number of people seeking big changes could grow.
The survey included landline and cellphone telephone interviews with 2,005 nationally representative adults. Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish. The margin of error is plus or minus 2.5 percentage points for most questions.
To divide the panel into the three groups, respondents were asked to select a favorite of three policies described as:
Changing our health care system so that all Americans would get health insurance from Medicare, which is now mainly for people age 65 or over and is paid for by taxpayers. This plan is often called Medicare for all.
Keeping the existing Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, and passing additional legislation to improve how it works.
Replacing the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, with a new law that would give taxpayer funding to states to design their own health insurance systems with fewer rules.
A survey of more than 2,000 adults found relatively broad agreement that health care is a right. (PHOTOGRAPH BY JOSHUA LOTT FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)

Germans Act To Toughen Laws to Curb Extremism

Texto completo: The country will increase background checks for gun buyers and requirements for reporting online hate speech.
BERLIN -- Prospective gun buyers in Germany would have to undergo background checks to ensure they have no ties to extremism and social media companies operating in the country would be required to report suspicious posts under a series of proposals advanced Wednesday by Chancellor Angela Merkel's government.
The legislation comes amid a recent spike in far-right crime. In June, a conservative politician, whose name had appeared on a neo-Nazi hit list circulated online, was fatally shot in the head in what officials believe was the country's first far-right political assassination since the Nazi era. And just three weeks ago, a right-wing gunman killed two people after attacking a synagogue in Halle on Yom Kippur.
"The threat from far-right extremism and far-right terrorism, and with them anti-Semitism, is high in Germany and we can't stress it often enough," Horst Seehofer, Germany's interior minister, said at a news conference.
The bulk of far-right attacks in recent years have consisted of anti-Semitic crimes and hate crimes targeting foreigners and those who support them. The far right has scapegoated immigrants as dangerous and broken longstanding taboos about using language that echoes that of the Nazis. This has come despite more than a decade of German economic prosperity and the country's persistent ranking as one of the safest in the world.
Alternative for Germany, a far-right party, has stoked public anxiety over the 2015 arrival of more than a million, mostly Muslim, refugees and closed ranks with neo-Nazis during street protests. After the synagogue attack, mainstream parties criticized the far right for contributing to the increase in violence by using aggressive language.
The proposals must still be approved by Parliament, where Ms. Merkel's government holds a majority. It is expected to pass.
The legislation would further toughen the country's strict 2018 law against online hate speech. The law passed last year requires companies running social media platforms, including Facebook, Google and Twitter, to remove "obviously illegal" content within 24 hours, or face fines of up to 50 million euros, or about $ 56 million.
Under the proposed legislation, just removing the posts would no longer be enough -- companies would also be required to report any such content to the authorities. Germany's federal police plan to establish a new department that would collect the reported content and the I.P. addresses -- the numbered codes that differentiate individual internet connections -- of those posts.
Spreading insults and hate-speech online would also carry stiffer sentences, reflecting the "unlimited reach" of such comments.
"It cannot be that there is fertile ground in this country for hate and incitement," said Christine Lambrecht, the country's justice minister.
Germany already has strict gun laws that forbid the production of weapons and require extensive training and a permit to purchase a firearm. Nevertheless, authorities found last year that more than 790 people considered far-right extremists held a weapons permit. Under the proposed legislation, those permits could be revoked.
The proposed legislation would also make attacks on local politicians and first-responders or emergency medical personnel a separate crime. Along with police officers and fire fighters, both groups have increasingly become the target of violence -- from both the left and the right -- while trying to carry out their jobs.
Germany's domestic intelligence agency considers an estimated 24,100 people in the country to be right-wing extremists. About half of them have the potential to become violent, authorities believe.
Critics charge the proposals do not go far enough to prevent people from turning extremist in the first place, despite its pledge of 115 million euros annually through 2023 for projects promoting democracy. But the legislation, they said, would not have prevented the attack on the synagogue.
The man accused in the attack, Stephan Balliet, did not have a previous record and was not on authorities' radar before he tried to carry out a massacre of Jews on Yom Kippur, the holiest day on their calendar. Authorities believe that he was radicalized online and built or printed on a 3D printer several of the weapons that he used in the attack -- one of the reasons that authorities believe more people were not harmed.
"I don't want to imagine how things would have turned out with professionally made weapons," Mr. Seehofer said of the attacker. "Nor do I want to think about how things would have turned out if we had American gun laws."

Texto completo: As he fights extradition to the U.S., a Ukranian tycoon and alleged "upper-echelon" associate of the Russian mafia has aligned his defense closely with President Trump: He has hired lawyers who travel in the president's inner circle and is pushing theories that he is being targeted for political reasons.
Dmytri Firtash -- who is under house arrest in Austria after posting a $174-million all-cash bond -- has spent nearly six years trying to avoid prosecution in the U.S. on bribery charges tied to mining rights in India.
In that effort, he has assembled a cast of characters familiar to anyone tracking the presidential impeachment drama and special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's inquiry into Russia's interference in the 2016 election.

In previous administrations, the oligarch's strategy of linking himself to a U.S. president's travails would have been considered risky because it could have provoked the Justice Department to assertively prove its independence. Under Trump, however, Firtash's strategy may be a smart move, some former federal prosecutors said.
A 2013 indictment in federal court here charges Firtash with bribing officials in India to secure licenses to mine minerals, including titanium for use by an airplane manufacturer, identifiable in court records as Boeing, the aerospace giant.
But to hear the legal arguments Firtash makes and the lawyers he has hired to make them, you might suspect the case had far more to do with the impeachment proceedings against Trump than Indian bribes.
In July, Firtash jettisoned his legal team -- led by a Democrat who also represented Michael Cohen, Trump's now-estranged former personal lawyer. He then hired attorneys Victoria Toensing and Joseph diGenova, a conservative power couple who frequently defend the president on television and radio and criticize investigations of him. The two have also worked closely with Trump's current personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani.
In recent months, Toensing and diGenova scored a rare face-to-face meeting with Atty. Gen. William Barr in which they asked him to drop Firtash's extradition, a Justice Department official said, confirming a Washington Post account of the lobbying effort. Barr declined to get involved, the official said.
Toensing, who declined to comment about the meeting, said the federal prosecution of her client was politically motivated and he had done nothing wrong.
"The case against Mr. Firtash is a legal travesty," Toensing told The Times. "He is an innocent man. Sadly, the Department of Justice has submitted false and misleading statements about him and the evidence to the Austrian courts."
Firtash initially claimed he was indicted because Washington wanted to prevent him from influencing Ukrainian politics during the country's fragile transition after a 2014 revolution deposed President Viktor Yanukovych, whose government Firtash had supported.
Firtash won an early round in an Austrian court, but in February 2017, an appeals court upheld the U.S. request to extradite him.
In June, Firtash's legal team gave Austrian officials an affidavit from Viktor Shokin, the former Ukrainian prosecutor general who was fired in 2015 under pressure from Western governments, including the Obama administration, which accused him of stalling on high-profile corruption cases.
In the affidavit, Shokin said former Vice President Joe Biden had warned the Ukrainian government to keep Firtash out of Ukraine in order to stop him from further influencing the country's politics. Shokin's affidavit also claimed that he was fired because he was investigating Burisma, a Ukrainian natural gas company for which Biden's son Hunter was a board member.
Giuliani has cited Shokin's affidavit in support of his claims that Biden should be investigated. Other Ukrainian officials -- as well as U.S. officials -- have said Biden's pressure to fire Shokin had nothing to do with Burisma. The investigation of the company was dormant by the time Biden pushed for Shokin's dismissal, they say.
Firtash's lawyers in Austria have also filed sealed court papers that criticize the Justice Department in line with theories promoted by Trump suggesting that investigators were improperly motivated by politics, according to people familiar with the arguments. The Justice Department has rebuffed those assertions, and officials have noted Firtash was indicted before Trump announced his candidacy and four years before Mueller was appointed special counsel.
Firtash hired Toensing and diGenova on the recommendation of the couple's Russian translator, Lev Parnas, according to people familiar with the legal team's work.
Toensing, diGenova and Parnas were actively helping Giuliani gather information on Democrats who they claim have ties to Ukraine, according to people familiar with their work.
Parnas and a business partner, Igor Fruman, are longtime clients and associates of Giuliani. They're both now under indictment after they were arrested in early October while trying to leave the country. They're charged with funneling illegal campaign donations to a Trump-allied political fund and Republican politicians.
When they were arrested at Washington's Dulles International Airport, the pair had one-way tickets to Austria.
Federal investigators, as well as House Democrats, are now exploring potential ties among Parnas, Fruman and Firtash, according to people familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the subject on the record. Giuliani, who did not respond to text messages seeking comment, has denied knowing the oligarch.
Federal prosecutors are examining Giuliani's financial dealings in Ukraine, and with Parnas and Fruman, a person familiar with the matter said, confirming reports in the Wall Street Journal and New York Times.
Firtash is one of a handful of Ukrainian businessmen whose power and money have influenced politics and policies in the countries of the former Soviet Union. Starting in the early 1990s, he made his fortune brokering deals buying natural gas from Russia and Central Asia to sell to Ukraine and Europe.
Firtash's holding company, Group DF, has significant assets and interests in Ukraine. The company's website says that in addition to gas distribution in Europe and Asia, Group DF has operations in the fertilizer, chemicals and titanium businesses as well as agribusiness, media and real estate. Many of his assets are in regions of eastern Ukraine now controlled by Russian-backed separatist militias as well as Russian-annexed Crimea.
Throughout Ukraine's two decades of independence since the breakup of the Soviet Union, Firtash has used his wealth and power to influence the country's politics. He and another Ukrainian oligarch, Rinat Akhmetov, financially backed Yanukovych and his Russia-aligned political party, the Party of Regions, during several political campaigns.
Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, worked as a consultant for the Party of Regions and Yanukovych beginning in 2005. Manafort is serving 7 1/2 years in a U.S. prison for financial fraud largely stemming from that work.
The bribery case against Firtash appears to be strong, former prosecutors noted, and the surest way to avoid prison time would be to convince Trump and the Justice Department to drop extradition.
"In the past, this was a strategy that was entirely counterproductive -- prosecutors were extremely sensitive to the charge that anything they were doing was politically motivated," said Peter Zeidenberg, a former federal prosecutor.
Now, however, "it's sad to say, but this strategy might be the appropriate one to take, given the politicization of today's Justice Department," he said. "Close associates of the president seem very likely to get extraordinary access and favorable treatment."

Texto completo: New York City’s chief medical examiner stands by the conclusion that deceased child sex trafficker and jet-setting financier Jeffrey Epstein died of suicide by hanging in his prison cell this summer.
Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Barbara Sampson rejected claims by forensic specialist Dr. Michael Baden that homicide was the more likely cause of death.
“Our investigation concluded that the cause of Mr. Epstein’s death was hanging and the manner of death was suicide. We stand by that determination,” Sampson told the Washington Examiner. “We continue to share information around the medical investigation with Mr. Epstein’s family, their representatives, and their pathology consultant. The original medical investigation was thorough and complete. There is no reason for a second medical investigation by our office.”
Epstein was found dead in his prison cell in New York City’s Metropolitan Correctional Center early on the morning of Aug. 10.
Baden, who held the same role as Sampson in the late 1970s and went on to become a celebrity medical examiner and host of “Autopsy” on HBO, was hired by Jeffrey Epstein’s younger brother, Mark Epstein, to conduct his own investigation.
Baden claimed on Wednesday morning that he did not believe Epstein died by suicide and the evidence pointed to homicide.
Epstein’s neck bone injuries were “extremely unusual in suicidal hangings and could occur much more commonly in homicidal strangulation,” he said. “I’ve not seen in fifty years where that occurred in a suicidal hanging.”
Epstein, the already convicted sex offender and financier, allegedly sexually exploited and abused dozens of minor girl at his homes in Manhattan, New York, and Palm Beach, Florida, among other locations, between 2002 and 2005, and perhaps beyond. Prosecutors claimed Epstein enticed and recruited minor girls to engage in sex acts with him and built a “vast network of underage victims.” Epstein’s high-profile friendships with people like former President Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew, and others have come under increased scrutiny following his death, and Epstein's victims have continued to fight for accountability.
In August, the medical examiner's office announced it had reviewed the investigation and conducted an autopsy to determine Epstein was hanged and died by suicide. The medical examiner's office said Epstein appeared to have tied a bedsheet to the top of a bunk bed and then moved toward the floor with enough force to break bones in his neck, according to the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, although the autopsy report has not been made public.

Attorney General William Barr said in August that he believes Epstein died by suicide in his Manhattan jail cell.
“I have seen nothing that undercuts the finding of the medical examiner that this was a suicide,” Barr told reporters.
Barr also said he was “appalled” to learn of Epstein’s apparent suicide and revealed the DOJ was “learning of serious irregularities at this facility that are deeply concerning and demand a thorough investigation.” Barr also said there will be accountability for those who did not do their jobs properly, and he ordered the FBI and Justice Department’s inspector general to investigate both an apparent suicide attempt in July and Epstein's August 10 death.
Barr said in August that his investigation into the circumstances surrounding Epstein’s death was moving "expeditiously" and that he expected to report his findings quickly to both Congress and the public, but no further information has been publicly released.
The Justice Department did not immediately respond to questions from the Washington Examiner about whether it still believed Epstein died by suicide and about when the results of DOJ’s own investigations on Epstein’s death might be made available.

Trump got it backward on who helped U.S. take down Baghdadi

Texto completo: All praise to the brave Special Forces operators and CIA analysts who took down the heinous ISIS chief, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.
President Donald Trump gets credit for ordering the raid, but his effusive self-praise diminished the moment. (He apparently forgot his tweet storm in 2012 demanding that credit for Osama bin Laden's demise go to "our brave military and intelligence officers," not to President Barack Obama.)
Moreover, Trump's remarks on Baghdadi's death, along with the wild news conference that followed, ignored the heavy cost of his sudden retreat from Syria, which nearly undercut the Baghdadi mission. That retreat leaves the door open for the rise of new jihadi movements.
Most unsettling, Trump offered thanks to Russia, Syria, and Turkey - all countries that have helped ISIS - while continuing to insult our Kurdish allies, who were key to this mission. His failure to grasp who are America's friends and who are adversaries means big security troubles down the road.
No surprise, Russia was number one on Trump's thank-you list. The Russians knew nothing about the operation and did nothing except stay out of the way. Contrary to Trump's claims, Russian forces in Syria were never interested in pursuing ISIS.
Russian TV called the Baghdadi operation "very strange" and accused the Americans of "creating" Baghdadi. "They were just laughing at Trump," says noted independent Russian journalist Yevgenia Albats. Yet Trump called the Russians "very good."
As for Syria, Trump actually thanked a regime headed by war criminal Bashar al-Assad, who released hundreds of ISIS fighters from prison at the beginning of their rise to power. Assad has also let Iran take over much of Syria. Never mind.
But the worst was Trump's praise for Turkey, a country notorious for letting ISIS fighters cross freely into Syria and be treated at Turkish hospitals.
"Turkey also has some explaining to do," writes Brett McGurk, former special presidential envoy for the global coalition to defeat ISIS, in the Washington Post. That's because Baghdadi was found not in ISIS's traditional area of eastern Turkey, but far away in western Turkey, near the Turkish border and Turkish military outposts. This suggests that Turkish military intelligence knew Baghdadi's location and didn't share it.
Clearly, the U.S. military distrusted Ankara. They chose to launch the Baghdadi operation from hundreds of miles away in Iraq, rather than from nearby Turkey (a NATO partner), and reportedly gave Turkey no advance notice. Yet Trump singled this ISIS enabler out for thanks, just the same.
And whose crucial help did he downplay? The Syrian Kurds, who, together with the Iraqi Kurds, reportedly provided more key intelligence help than did any country, and were key in locating Baghdadi. Syrian Kurdish leaders say they were working with U.S. forces on this mission for the past five months, and continued to do so even after Trump sold them out to Turkey early this month. This is why the celebration of Baghdadi's demise is undermined by Trump's performance. The president is clearly ignorant of, or doesn't care about, Turkey's enabling of ISIS. Ditto for Russia's and Syria's indifference. He keeps repeating that they all hate ISIS. They don't.
It's the Kurds who hate ISIS, and who lost 11,000 men and women defeating the caliphate. It's the Kurds who were willing to keep the ISIS network from reviving, backed by a minimal 1,000-troop U.S. presence that had taken almost no casualties. This was a small, safe investment to prevent an ISIS revival until Syria stabilized. It wasn't, as Trump has insisted, a commitment to stay for the next 200 years.
Instead, Trump, on a whim and a phone call to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, pulled out U.S. troops and gave the Turks the green light to invade Syria. In his news conference, the president joked at how minimal the cost was to the Kurds. Again, his ignorance was shocking.
The Turkish invasion has created 200,000 Kurdish refugees, emptied Kurdish cities and towns, and forced the Kurds to turn reluctantly away from America toward Russia and Syria. Our troop withdrawal, along with the loss of Syrian Kurdish help, will deprive us of critical intelligence we need to keep any future ISIS resurgence down.
This is why so many special forces and CIA operatives in Syria, the forces Trump did deign to praise, were dismayed by the troop withdrawal. Some told journalists they felt their withdrawal had betrayed allies they will need in the future.
Some of these operatives also complained that Trump's abrupt withdrawal order three weeks ago disrupted meticulous plans for the operation and made it more risky. Baghdadi's death, some military and counterintelligence sources told the New York Times, "occurred largely in spite of, and not because of, Mr. Trump's actions."
When a U.S. president praises our adversaries and undercuts our friends it doesn't bode well for the future. That was the subtext that ran through Trump's thumping self-celebration of Baghdadi's death.

Ray Jenkins Former Evening Sun editorial page editor, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and aide to President Carter

Texto completo: Ray Jenkins, a former Evening Sun editorial page editor and a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist who was a press aide to President Jimmy Carter, died Thursday from heart failure at his Guilford home. He was 89.
"Ray was a fine Southern gentleman who offered us a bit of guidance and wisdom from another time that helped us as Northerners understand that part of the country a lot better," said Ernest F. Imhoff, a retired Evening Sun and Baltimore Sun editor.
"He came from a Southern tradition and was a wonderful newspaperman who had a great take on the different issues that came up," said Mr. Imhoff, a Mount Washington resident. "He offered sound wisdom without making him sound like a know-it-all."
G. Jefferson Price III, former longtime Baltimore Sun foreign editor, was on Mr. Jenkins' editorial staff.
"I only worked for Ray Jenkins for two of my 35 years at the Sunpapers, but he was one of the most thoughtful, enlightened. gracious and fair-minded men I've ever known," said Mr. Price, a Mattapoisett, Massachusetts, resident. "His intellectual stream was vast, and he had a marvelous, often self-deprecating, sense of humor."
Carrell Ray Jenkins - he never used his first name - the son of Herbert Jenkins, an International Harvester salesman, and his wife, Eunice Thornton Jenkins Maples, a homemaker, was born in Sylvester, Georgia, and raised on his family's farm in south Georgia.
After graduating from Camilla High School at the age of 16, Mr. Jenkins entered the Grady School of Journalism at the University of Georgia, from which he graduated in 1950.
Mr. Jenkins began his career as a reporter in 1951 with the Columbus, Georgia, Ledger, and was a member of the team that won the 1955 Pulitzer Prize for exposing political corruption on Phenix City, Alabama, an Army post town near Fort Benning, Georgia. His stories about gambling, prostitution and corruption culminated in the arrest and indictment of the city's mayor.
He was promoted to city editor of The Ledger, a position he held until 1959, when he joined the staff as city editor of the Alabama Journal in Montgomery, Alabama, and later was promoted to its editorial page editor. In 1976, he became editorial page editor of the Montgomery Advertiser.
Two years later, he became editor and vice president of the Montgomery Advertiser and Alabama Journal, which were published by the Advertiser Co.
He spent nearly two decades covering the civil rights movement.
Mr. Jenkins earned a reputation for being a "fiercely independent man who stuck by his liberal political philosophy when it was in and out of favor," according to a 1991 Evening Sun article.
Shortly after arriving in Montgomery, Mr. Jenkins befriended Dr. Martin Luther King, pastor of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church, where he met the civil rights activist in his basement office.
"From that first meeting, Dr. King noted that Mr. Jenkins was the first Montgomery reporter ever to contact him and interview him," Nancy Jenkins-Chafin of Richmond, Virginia, wrote in a biographical profile of her father.
"It was the beginning of a professional relationship and friendship that enabled him to provide readers in a deeply segregated South with a deeper understanding of Dr. King's mission and his personal convictions," wrote Ms. Jenkins-Chafin, editor of the Virginia Episcopalian. "He followed Dr. King on the civil rights trail, including the Selma march and the March on Washington."
"The most significant story I ever wrote," Mr. Jenkins told the Evening Sun in 1991, "was a routine story I wrote in 15 minutes and that didn't even carry a byline."
Mr. Jenkins' 12-inch story was about an advertisement in The New York Times in 1960 that requested funds to defend Dr. King in a Montgomery perjury case, while at the same time castigating Alabama justice and Alabama officials.
"Jenkins' story set in motion a series of events that led to the Supreme Court's landmark New York Times v. Sullivan libel decision. The decision stiffened criteria for public officials in libel cases," reported The Evening Sun.
Another personage he covered during his tenure in Montgomery was Gov. George C. Wallace, the governor of Alabama and outspoken foe of the civil rights movement.
Mr. Jenkins explained in a 1979 Alabama Journal interview that the Advertiser was "generally known as the anti-Wallace paper."
"And that's probably accurate," he said. "But my personal relationship with Wallace is fairly good. ... I have a big respect for the man's political ability. But we rarely have been on the same side of a political issue."
Mr. Jenkins was 48 years old when he left the Advertiser-Journal in 1979 for the White House after accepting the newly created post as special assistant to President Jimmy Carter, which effectively made him the No, 2 man in the press office, which was then headed by Jody Powell, the president's press secretary.
In a departing interview for the Advertiser-Journal, Mr. Jenkins explained that his role would not be one of policy-making but more like that of a "pool reporter who sits in on important meetings and then goes out and tries to give as accurate and as a complete picture as is humanly possible."
He added that while he had lots of friends in the journalism community in both Washington and across the country, that in his new role "I sure as hell hope I'm able to keep them."
"The White House is a good place to have been," Mr. Jenkins told The Evening Sun, "not to be."
In 1981, then A.S. Abell Co. publisher J. Reginald Murphy named Mr. Jenkins, who was then editor of the Clearwater Sun in Florida, editorial page editor of The Evening Sun.
"I've spent half of my time in newspapers writing editorials; it's my first love," he said at the time. "I feel more comfortable with writing than with the administrative side of the newspaper, and I'm looking forward to returning to the editorial page."
After his appointment to The Evening Sun, he explained his philosophy for the page.
"I don't want to sound pretentious, but the editorial page ought to be the repository of the conscience of the community," he said. "The editorial page ought to be interesting, well-written and well-reasoned," adding, "except editorials ought to be short, and I tend to be windy."
"Never one to take the trade too seriously, I recall his observation that 'editorial writers are the ones who come onto the field after battle and shoot the wounded,' " Mr. Price recalled, with a laugh.
"Ray was a wonderful writer, a keen editor, a great boss and a great human being," said Sara Engram of Ruxton, former Evening Sun editorial page director.
"The years I spent as his deputy were some of the most fulfilling years of my professional life. He was always encouraging me to take on new challenges, and in tough situations he always stood up for me and the staff," Ms. Engram said. "Those were the days when newspapers had power, and Ray knew how to use it wisely and always with good humor."
Mr. Jenkins' daily work schedule saw him out of bed by 4:30 a.m. and working. He busied himself reading the day's news in The Baltimore Sun and The New York Times and scanning Associated Press files on his computer. He then began work on a daily editorial - sometimes two - for that day's Evening Sun.
He retired in 1991.
Mr. Jenkins who was a Nieman Fellow at Harvard University from 1964 to 1965, earned a law degree from Faulkner University's Thomas Goode Jones School of Law in Montgomery, Alabama, in 1977, and was admitted to the American Bar Association and the Alabama Bar Association.
"I have had a life-long fascination with the law, so I studied law at night school in Montgomery," he told the Evening Sun in 1981. "But I have never practiced law or any other dubious profession."
Through the years, his newspaper work earned him numerous awards including the Ernie Pyle Award for human interest reporting and the annual civil rights award of the Maryland chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union.
Mr. Jenkins, who was a frequent contributor and columnist for The New York Times, published his first book, "Blind Vengeance," in 1997, which detailed the true story of an Alabama mail bomber whose crimes were racially motivated.
He was a member of the American Society of Newspaper Editors and the Hamilton Street Club.
A celebration of life gathering will be held from 2 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. Saturday at the Johns Hopkins Club, 3400 N. Charles St., Baltimore.
In addition to his daughter, he is survived by his wife of 63 years, the former Bettina Cirsovius, an artist and author; two sons, Mark C. Jenkins of Montgomer, and Samuel J. Jenkins of Memphis, Tennessee; and four grandchildren.

Hometown important to Chicago Cubs manager Ross

Texto completo: David Ross has returned to Chicago and Wrigley Field as the Cubs' 55th manager in team history. However, his Florida Panhandle hometown represents family and friendships and remains important to him.
"I think Tallahassee has had a huge impact on who I am and the qualities I get a lot of praise for," Ross told the Democrat. "Along with my amazing parents, this town has shaped who I am as a person and the things I value."
Ross, 42, held his first press conference Monday at Wrigley Field as the Cubs new manager.
The organization officially announced his hiring last week, signing their former catcher, special assistant in the front office and ESPN analyst to a three-year contract with an option for a fourth.
Though Ross has never managed before, he explained Monday that there "are many ways to get experience. But I am ready for this. .. I know what winning looks like." Ross also said he had been preparing for the opportunity to manage his entire career.
Former Auburn baseball coach Hal Baird, who signed Ross out of Florida High in 1995, always believed Ross would be an ideal managerial candidate. Though Ross played at Auburn for only two seasons before he transferred to Florida, Baird said the player's impact was clearly felt.
"David's one of the very few people I ever coached , or was ever around, who truly made the players around him better," Baird said.
"I don't think I ever had a player who was more popular among his teammates. People may have seen him on (TV) and see that he's so affable, so personable and so engaging. The harder edge doesn't always come through. Believe me, he's one competitive son-of-a-gun.
"I am not surprised because I always thought it (being an MLB manager) might be an itch he'd have to scratch."
Ross plans to continue to live in Tallahassee in the offseason. He recently purchased a new home. His three young children and parents, who attended Monday's press conference, are in Tallahassee.
Ross can navigate the town without the fanfare that accompanies him on the road. He routinely plays golf with friends, favors Starbucks coffee and, for the past 12 years, has teamed with fellow Florida High alum Bryan Henry to hold a Father-Son Baseball Camp.
Ross' personality was also on display during the press conference. He mentioned his father David usually wears flip-flops but instead dressed up for the event.
"We don't look at him as a manager, we look at him as a son," said his mother Jackie. "It's amazing to see where he's come from to where he is today and how hard he's worked."
When Ross retired in 2016 to close out his 15-year MLB career, he didn't pause long to catch his breath. He finished second in the popular television show "Dancing With the Stars" and penned his best-selling autobiography with Tallassee resident and New York Times best-selling author Don Yaeger.
"The thing I most-often share when I'm asked working with David is what a high level of self-awareness he possesses," Yaeger explained.
"I don't find that in all the athletes I'm blessed to work with. He knows what he knows...and what he doesn't. He's open to coaching from others, especially on areas where he's trying to grow and develop. His self-deprecating humor immediately breaks down barriers, but then he legitimately locks in to whomever he's with."
Ross is replacing Joe Maddon, who led the Cubs to their first World Series title in more than a century in 2016. Ross, who also won a World Series crown with the Boston Red Sox, hit a home run in Game 7 to help the Cubs beat the Cleveland Indians three years ago.
While Ross stressed Monday he's willing to put in the time and effort to do the job in Chicago, Tallahassee won't be far away.
"Treating people with kindness and respect is something I learned at a young age and I try to hold on to those values daily," Ross said. "Family, friends, coaches, teachers, strangers at the gym, never lack a kind word or an influencing thought.
"Tallahassee is a huge part of me."
Editor's Note: Bryan Henry is Jim Henry's son. Jim also worked with Yaeger on Ross' autobiography.

'Double whammy': House approves sweeping Turkey sanctions bill, recognizes Armenian genocide

Resumen: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has fast-tracked a sanctions bill for Turkey that would require a detailed accounting of President Erdogan's net worth.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – In a remarkable rebuke of a NATO ally, the House on Tuesday approved a biting sanctions bill that could cripple Turkey's economy and would punish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan personally by requiring an assessment of his net worth amid questions about his finances in Turkey.
Lawmakers also passed a deeply contentious measure to commemorate the Armenian genocide, a historic move that will almost certainly exacerbate U. S. -Turkey tensions. The genocide measure officially recognizes the systematic killing of 1. 5 million Armenians by the Ottoman Empire from 1915 to 1923.
"Members of my own family were among those murdered, and my parents fled with my grandparents to America," said Rep. Anna Eshoo, D-Calif. "What all of the persecuted had in common was that they were Christians. "
For years, Turkey’s government had successfully lobbied to kill such congressional resolutions, pressuring presidents and lawmakers alike with sophisticated influence campaigns. The Turks have argued the Armenians who died during that era were victims of civil war and unrest, not genocide. On Tuesday, it passed by an overwhelming vote of 405-to-11, with three lawmakers voting "present. "
The genocide and sanctions measures represent “a double whammy” for Turkey, said Bulent Aliriza, director of the Turkey Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington foreign policy institute.
Turkey condemned the House votes, saying the sanctions bill is "incompatible with the spirit of our allied relations under NATO. "
The country's minister of foreign affairs denounced the genocide vote as a "shameful decision of those exploiting history. "
Lawmakers in both parties barreled ahead with the two measures to make Erdogan pay for Turkey's assault on U. S. -allied Kurdish forces in Syria even though the fighting has now mostly stopped. Members of Congress say Erdogan's attack unleashed violence and chaos that continues to reverberate across the region.
"America is holding accountable top Turkish officials responsible for human rights abuses, including attacking our Kurdish partners," said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. "We're penalizing Turkish financial institutions who perpetuate President Erdogan's corruption and abuses. "
Pelosi, D-Calif. , fast-tracked the sanctions legislation, which goes well beyond President Donald Trump's temporary sanctions on Turkey. Although it passed the House by a vote of 403-to-16, its fate in the Senate is unclear.
Among other things, the legislation would:
• Ban most U. S. arms sales to Turkey and sanction other countries' military transactions.
• Sanctions senior Turkish officials involved in the Syria attack
• Blacklist a state-owned bank that is central to Turkey's economy.
• Require the State Department to provide a detailed account of Erdogan's net worth and income – along with that of his family members.
"The carnage that we have seen over the past week against our Kurdish partners and innocent civilians has been unbearable. There must be consequences," Rep. Michael McCaul, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said in unveiling the sanctions bill. He and the committee's chairman, Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N. Y. , are the chief sponsors.
Erdogan's press office in Ankara did not respond to a request for comment.
Trump imposed limited sanctions on Turkey on Oct. 14, about five days after Erdogan ordered the military assault on Syrian Kurdish forces, known as the SDF. The president lifted those sanctions nine days later after Turkey agreed to a cease-fire.
"The president’s sanctions were little pinpricks," said Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md. , who has sponsored a similar Turkey sanctions bill in the Senate, along with Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S. C.
When he lifted the sanctions on Oct. 23, Trump said his policy had been a big success.
"By getting that cease-fire to stick, we’ve done something that’s very, very special," he said. "We have avoided another costly military intervention that could’ve led to disastrous, far-reaching consequences. "
But Van Hollen and others said it's not clear what influence, if any, Trump's sanctions had on Turkey.
The House and Senate bills, by contrast, would almost certainly rock Turkey's already fragile economy. And the provisions targeting Erdogan's wealth are particularly provocative, experts say.
Erdogan: From 'broke' to 'well-off'
Both the House and Senate bills would require the State Department, along with U. S. Treasury and intelligence officials, to submit a report to Congress detailing the Erdogan family's assets, investments, business interests, and income.
“There is broad bipartisan support for getting more information about the sources of Erdogan’s wealth," Engel said in a statement to USA TODAY. "As Erdogan continues to make policy decisions that destabilize the region and threaten international security, we need to know the full picture of his financial interests. ”
The report would have to include financial information about the Turkish president's spouse, children, parents and siblings – and Erdogan would see it as a slap in the face, said Aykan Erdemir, a former member of the Turkish Parliament who is now a senior fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, a hawkish Washington think tank.
"Erdogan was known to be broke when he entered politics," Erdemir said. "Now he is a well-off man. " But there has been little public accounting for that transformation.
In 2017, the leader of Turkey’s main opposition party said he had documents showing that members of Erdogan’s family, with the help of associates, had transferred at least $15 million to an offshore company in 2011 and 2012. As Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the opposition leader, began addressing parliament regarding the alleged offshore accounts, the state-controlled broadcaster cut the transmission, according to a Voice of America account. Senior members of Erdogan's party denounced Kilicdaroglu's remarks as false.
Also in 2017, an investigative news outlet focused on the Black Sea region reported that Erdogan's family owned at least three offshore companies in the Isle of Man.
"Since around 2008, the Erdogan family has operated a network of companies that stretches from Malta to Turkey and ends up in the Isle of Man," the theblacksea. eu reported in a November 2017 story. "Together, they act as an opaque offshore network designed to obscure the family’s ownership" of a $25 million oil and chemicals tanker called the Agdash, the outlet said.
Erdogan has denied involvement in the activities and blasted the allegations from Turkey's opposition party as "lies. "
If Erdogan and his family's finances were to be exposed, "he would see this as a major threat," Erdemir said. "In Turkey, he has pretty much silenced all the media, and no one would dare to do such an expose. . . . But if it’s coming from Congress, he would perceive this as very damaging. "
Van Hollen and others say the public – in the U. S. and in Turkey – has a right to know if Erdogan and his family have foreign investments that might be swaying his official actions, most notably Turkey's increasingly friendly relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
"The goal is to get the facts and find out where Erdogan’s allegiances are, including his financial dealings," Van Hollen said.
Targeting a state-owned bank
The House and Senate bills would also sanction a powerful state-owned bank that is enmeshed in a U. S. money laundering and fraud investigation.
Last week, federal prosecutors in New York charged Halkbank with evading U. S. sanctions on Iran by moving billions of dollars in Iranian oil and gas proceeds back to Tehran and disguising some of the transactions as involving food, medicine and other humanitarian aid.
"High-ranking government officials in Iran and Turkey participated in these scheme," the six-count indictment alleges. "Some officials received bribes worth tens of millions of dollars" to promote the scheme and shield it from the U. S. scrutiny.
Halkbank is the second-largest state-owned bank in Turkey, and Erdogan personally lobbied Trump to intervene in the case, according to reports last week from Bloomberg and the New York Times. Bloomberg reported that Trump had tasked his attorney general and Treasury secretary to deal with Erdogan’s repeated pleas to avoid the charges.
If Congress sanctions Halkbank, "that’s a big deal," said Aliriza. He and others said it would link Turkey's incursion into Syria to the U. S. criminal case and would deal a heavy blow to the Turkish economy.
The House bill is likely to pass with bipartisan support, as lawmakers in both parties clamor for a more forceful U. S. response to Turkey's actions.
Critics say Trump's Oct. 6 decision to withdraw U. S. troops from the Turkey-Syria border region gave Erdogan the green light to attack the Kurds, who have been America's chief ally in the fight against Islamic State terrorists. Trump administration officials have argued that the president's decision simply removed those troops from harm's way and the U. S. never promised the Kurds they would protect them against a Turkish military attack.
"Congress must speak out and show decisive action to hold accountable those who created this catastrophe: President Erdogan, who is directing this slaughter, and President Trump, who opened the door to the Turkish incursion and betrayed our Kurdish partners," said Engel, the bill's lead sponsor and Foreign Affairs Committee chairman.
Bill could face a major hurdle in the Senate
“We need to think extremely carefully before” imposing sanctions on a NATO ally, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said last week. He said it’s not clear if such economic penalties would weaken Erdogan inside Turkey or “rally the country to cause. ” He said the effect of such a bill also could hurt American companies and U. S. allies whose economies are closely intertwined with Turkey’s.
Van Hollen said he hopes the House's actions will put pressure on McConnell to reconsider that position.
"The Senate needs to stop twiddling its thumbs and take action," he said.

Texto completo: The Navy SEAL commando force is the stuff of legend, lionized for the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, rescuing an American sea captain from Somali pirates and fighting to the death in the mountains of Afghanistan in the "Lone Survivor" story.
This summer, however, the commander of this vaunted band of war fighters warned about an ethical and professional crisis in the ranks. "We have a problem," Rear Adm. Collin Green wrote in a letter to the troops. "Some of our subordinate formations have failed to maintain good order and discipline and as a result and for good reason, our (Naval Special Warfare) culture is being questioned."
There was cocaine abuse in a SEAL team based in Virginia. Two SEALs were accused of killing a U.S. soldier in a hazing in North Africa. Another SEAL allegedly raped an American female service member during a drunken party in Iraq.
And then there was the case of Navy SEAL Edward Gallagher.
A combat veteran with the nickname Blade – who said he craved combat and the chance to "kill as many people as possible," according to The New York Times – Gallagher was accused by members of his platoon of battlefield atrocities in Iraq while fighting the Islamic State terrorist group in 2017.
The allegations included shooting Iraqi civilians from a sniper's nest, firing indiscriminately into neighborhoods with a heavy machine gun, and using a custom-made knife to stab a teenage captive to death before posing with the corpse for a photograph.
The Navy was slow to investigate, and the prosecution's case began falling apart even before trial amid concerns about witness intimidation. Gallagher, who had become the darling of right-wing commentators, was acquitted in July on all charges except the one dealing with posing with a dead body.
According to The Times report last week, after Green began worrying about an anti-authority "Gallagher effect" infecting his elite force, an Instagram account belonging to Gallagher and his wife offered T-shirts with the phrase "Gallagher effect" and decried Green and another top leader as "a bunch of morons." Plans were drawn up to force Gallagher out of the SEALs based on new evidence of misconduct after unauthorized weapons, stolen equipment and illegal drugs were found in Gallagher's home and a work locker.
Then President Donald Trump entered the picture.
The commander in chief, who has advocated torture and taken a keen interest in pardoning troops convicted of war crimes, complained in a tweet this month that "we train our boys to be killing machines, then prosecute them when they kill!"
He followed Gallagher's case, even discussing it with senior Navy officials. According to The Times, the Navy was faced with a dilemma: It could kick Gallagher out of the SEALs to help restore good order and discipline, but risk a reversal by Trump that would effectively emasculate SEAL leadership. So no action has been taken. And what Navy leaders most feared has likely come to pass: They've been shown powerless as the Gallagher effect undermines the unit's ethical code that "uncompromising integrity is my standard. My character and honor are steadfast. My word is my bond."
Last week, former Navy SEAL and retired Adm. William McRaven – the highly respected architect of the bin Laden raid – reflected in a column about America's military ethos.
"The Greatest Generation went to war because it believed that we were the good guys," he wrote. "We are the most powerful nation ... because we try to be the good guys."
But with Gallaghers in the ranks and a president in their corner, is the United States still the good guys?

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – The White House's top expert on Ukraine twice notified superiors about concerns that the president and those working for him were linking foreign aid to Ukraine with investigations that would help President Donald Trump politically, a push that he said could undermine U. S. national security, according to an opening statement obtained by USA TODAY.
The testimony of Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman before the House Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight committees Tuesday will mark the first time lawmakers investigating the impeachment inquiry will hear from someone who listened to Trump's July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky — the call at the center of the impeachment investigation that included a Trump's request that Ukraine investigate former Vice President Joe Biden.
"I was concerned by the call," Vindman wrote in the opening statement. "I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U. S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U. S. government’s support of Ukraine. "

In the six-page opening statement, Vindman, a key member of the National Security Council, outlined his dedicated service to the country, including his two decades as an Army officer, which included a tour in Iraq where he was wounded in an IED attack and awarded a Purple Heart. He says his family fled the Soviet Union and immigrated to New York City in 1979, giving him a deep appreciation of the American dream.
"I am a patriot," he says in the statement. "And it is my sacred duty and honor to advance and defend OUR country, irrespective of party or politics. "
Vindman offered an overview of his role within the Trump administration in the testimony, including being tasked to attend Zelensky's inauguration in May, and details two specific events that he found concerning, "inappropriate" and led to him reporting the situation to the National Security Council's top lawyer.
The first was in July when a number of officials, including former National Security Advisor John Bolton, Ambassadors Kurt Volker and Gordon Sondland — two key witnesses that have testified to lawmakers — and Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who resigned earlier this month, met with Oleksandr Danylyuk, Ukraine's Secretary of National Security and Defense Council, according to the testimony.
The meeting in Washington was going well until the Ukrainians asked about a potential meeting between Trump and Zelensky, Vindman writes. That was when Sondland "started to speak about Ukraine delivering specific investigations in order to secure the meeting with the President. "
Bolton then cut the meeting short, according to the testimony. Vindman wrote that after the meeting there was a debriefing where he confronted Sondland, saying "his statements were inappropriate, that the request to investigate Biden and his son had nothing to do with national security, and that such investigations were not something the NSC was going to get involved in or push. "
It was after that meeting that Vindman reported his concerns to the National Security Council's chief lawyer.
Vindman said he reported a second concern after listening to Trump's July 25 call with Zelensky, where the president talked about military aid for the country, then asked about investigations into Biden and 2016 election.
He said Ukraine launching such investigations would push partisan politics into helping Ukraine fend off Russia, which would "undermine U. S. national security. "
The New York Times first reported on Vindman's opening statement.

Jamelle Bouie: Our president is more internet troll than head of state

Texto completo: President Donald Trump is reckless with words and careless with actions. There’s no evidence that he thinks deeply about anything. Which is why I was not shocked when he condemned the House impeachment inquiry as a “lynching” earlier this week.
“So some day, if a Democrat becomes President and Republicans win the House, even by a tiny margin, they can impeach the president, without due process or fairness or any legal rights. All Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here — a lynching. But we will WIN!”
More than 4,000 African American men, women and children were lynched — burned, beaten, drowned, shot or hanged to death — between 1877 and 1950. Trump almost certainly doesn’t know this. To a president who operates as an internet troll as much as a head of state, “lynching” is just another provocation — another way to seize the national conversation in the face of bad news and criticism. And to a man who can’t see beyond his own ego, “lynching” must feel like an apt analogy for the scrutiny of his political opponents. He can’t imagine anything worse.
Trump’s behavior didn’t shock me. What did shock me was a comment from Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. When asked about the president’s “lynching” remark, Graham said the comparison was apt: “Yes, this is a lynching, and in every sense, this is un-American. I’ve never seen a situation in my lifetime as a lawyer where someone is accused of a major misconduct and cannot confront the accuser or call witnesses on their behalf.”
Trump is ignorant; Graham is not. In 2005, during Graham’s first Senate term, a unanimous Senate passed a resolution apologizing to lynching victims and their descendants for the chamber’s failure to enact anti-lynching legislation. It expressed “the deepest sympathies and most solemn regrets of the Senate to the descendants of the victims of lynching, the ancestors of whom were deprived of life, human dignity, and the constitutional protections accorded all citizens of the United States.” It also called on the Senate to “remember the history of lynching, to ensure that these tragedies will neither be forgotten nor repeated.”
The Senate likewise voted at the end of last year to make lynching a federal crime — another symbolic act of contrition. The vote, again, was unanimous, and Graham, again, was there. But even if he hadn’t been — and even if these votes had never happened — Graham should still know better. According to the Equal Justice Initiative, a nonprofit advocacy group focused on criminal and racial justice, 185 black Americans were reported lynched in South Carolina.
Graham is a native of Central, South Carolina, a small town in Pickens County at the northwest edge of the state. At least four of the 185 lynchings took place in the area. In 1947, eight years before Graham was born, a 24-year-old black man named Willie Earle was taken from jail — where he was held on charges of assault — and killed by a mob of white men, the last racially motivated lynching to take place in the state. A generation earlier, in 1912, a black teenager named Brooks Gordon was lynched for allegedly shooting at a white woman while she drew water from a spring. Twenty-two years before that, in 1890, Henry Johnson was killed after he was accused of rape. Another black man accused of assault — his name is lost to history — was lynched in 1891.
No, Graham did not live through this era. But his parents did, and the violence of that period marks the place he calls home. It marks the entire region and state. As a lawmaker who represents that state — who represents families and communities upended by racial terrorism past and present — Graham has a particular responsibility to that history. He owes his constituents a degree of sensitivity, an awareness of the weight of a word like “lynching.”
Graham has rejected those obligations. Instead, he’s content to affirm Trump’s endless sense of his own victimhood. On Thursday, Graham introduced a resolution in the Senate to condemn the impeachment inquiry in the House. He will say anything to defend the president, even if it means minimizing one of the worst crimes this nation has perpetrated on its own citizens. Graham hasn’t just embraced the president, he’s embraced Trump’s total shamelessness — his absolute failure to hold himself accountable to any worthwhile standard of character.
The day before Trump and Graham made their comments, the Emmett Till Memorial Commission in Mississippi erected its fourth sign marking the spot on the Tallahatchie River where, in the summer of 1955, Till’s body was found after he was kidnapped, tortured and lynched. The three previous signs had been either stolen or vandalized, and two were riddled with bullets in displays of anger and contempt. The new sign is made of steel.
The reason to condemn Trump and Graham for their “lynching” remarks is not to score a partisan point or because it will make a difference in their language or behavior. It’s because we haven’t actually resolved the trauma of the past. Historical spaces are still contested. The scars are still present.

Just because the oppositions to the Republican candidates for county office is not very formidable, there is no reason why the voters of the county should display any lessening interest in going to the polls next Tuesday. The reasons are all the more imperative why they should turn out and cast their vote in order that there should be no miscarriages of the will of the people of the county.

In her finest performance, world-renowned pianist Susan Starr had tears streaming from her eyes. It was while playing the second movement of Rachmaninoff’s “Concerto No. 3” in 1981 in Austin, Texas, when she was overcome with emotion.

The Blade newsroom not for or against the President

Texto completo: IT IS IRONIC that most of the complaints I receive about The Blade concern stories that The Blade doesn't write.

You probably know where I'm going with this, but the actions by President Trump and the reporting about those actions spur more complaints to the newspaper than any other single topic.

Our grammatical mistakes may come in a close second.

Let me state at the beginning that The Blade no longer has reporters in Washington covering the White House and Congress. We haven't for many years.

The stories you read in The Blade about Mr. Trump and all the controversies swirling around him are written by reporters for the Associated Press, Reuters, The New York Times, the Washington Post, and other wire services The Blade pays for.

This is nothing new. For decades the newspaper has spent many hundreds of thousands of dollars a year to have national and international news stories sent to the Blade Building in downtown Toledo.

The term wire stories and wire service is an indication of the longevity of this practice - back to the age of the telegraph in the 1920s and 1930s.

I have only been at The Blade the past 40 years, but I'd bet that the editors in the 1920s were no more interested in publishing fake news any more than the editors I was trained under.

That is a charge I've heard many times over the past couple years.

The story you published today is nothing but a conspiracy theory based on fake news, one anonymous reader wrote to me recently. The story in question was about President Trump's dealings with the president of the Ukraine and whether he was trying to get Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter.

Another reader felt we didn't jump on that story quick enough.

The Giuliani-Ukraine-Trump story was downplayed on Friday and not reported at all of Saturday or Sunday, Larry Rosenberg wrote to me. The Blade is not reporting a prominent domestic story with international ramifications. Isn't that a conscious fallacy by omission?

I know these are polarized times with the country seemingly split down the middle for or against Mr. Trump, but I hope you'll believe me when I say the Blade newsroom is not for or against the President. Our job is to publish stories about what he does and the reaction to that.

I will tell you that the night news desk editors, whose job it is to produce the newspaper on deadline at night, are under instructions from me to remove any editorial comments in wire stories about the President. That's not because we're trying to protect him, but because editorial comments should be on the editorial pages and not in news columns.

Other readers let me know when they think what we write is inaccurate when covering presidential politics, such the use of the word socialist.

A true socialist is someone who wants all of the business and workplaces to be owned and controlled by the state, Stewart Epstein informed me. Democrats who want our federal government to spend more on social programs to help the lower and middle classes as they struggle to survive and pay their bills are not 'socialists.' They are 'liberal/progressives' who want our market-based capitalist economic system to become MORE HUMANE.

And then there is Donald Gorrell of Sylvania who believes that Washington is run by incompetents and crooks.

What elected officials in Washington are doing and/or not doing is terrible and should all be fired, Mr. Gorrell writes to The Blade. Do I agree with our President on everything he is or has done? NO. And I sincerely doubt that anyone could please me entirely.

**************

Now for a couple grammar lessons thanks to Blade readers:

From Steven Kutcher: I believe that journalists have an obligation to use the English language correctly. Two times last week The Blade used the word siege in headline articles concerning military action by Turkey. Though the word sounds good it does not apply to facts on the ground.

Mr. Kutcher is correct. Siege is a military operation in which enemy forces surround a town or building, cutting off essential supplies. What Turkey reportedly did in northern Syria was to bomb villages and watch the Kurds flee.

And a personal thank you to Debbie Keller for pointing out a mistake in my last column: I was raised by a mom who was an English major and was our manner and grammar police. One of her pet peeves and now mine is not using an adverb correctly.

You stated, 'I can't believe we screwed this up so bad.' You screwed up badly, not bad.

Texto completo: It's only a little over a month since an intelligence community whistleblower turned the Trump administration on its side; it may seem like more. At first, the story seemed straightforward: The informant charged that President Trump had pressured Ukraine's new president to investigate Joe Biden's son and blocked U.S. military aid to force the Ukrainian leader to do his bidding.
But the story has become more complicated along the way. Trump wasn't asking only for an inquiry into the Bidens. He also wanted Ukraine to look for evidence that might exonerate Russia from responsibility for the 2016 cyberattacks against the Democratic Party. He dispatched Atty. Gen. William Barr around the world to seek evidence that the Obama administration's investigation of his campaign was politically motivated. He said he still wants someone to find the Democratic Party's "missing" computer server, which isn't missing, and Hillary Clinton's lost emails, which no longer exist.
Here's one mystery in the case: How did poor, embattled Ukraine land in the middle of so many Trumpworld conspiracy theories about what happened in 2016?

Well, Ukraine is next to Russia -- and Vladimir Putin has never fully accepted Kyiv's desire to escape from Moscow's sphere of influence. Regaining sway there is arguably the Russian president's No. 1 foreign policy goal.
"I believe that Russians and Ukrainians are actually one people," Putin told filmmaker Oliver Stone in June. "One nation, in fact.... We have many things in common; we can use this as our competitive advantage during some form of integration."
Trump does not have a long history of dealing with Ukraine, but he does have a long record of admiration for Putin. In 2014, as he prepared his campaign, the future president praised the Russian's decision to seize Crimea, which has been part of Ukraine since 1954.
"He's done an amazing job," Trump said. "So smart."
When he arrived in the White House, the president inherited a policy of sanctions against Putin over the invasion. He didn't like it; he said it got in the way of better relations. Bipartisan majorities in Congress disagreed.
But Trump never abandoned his preference for Russia. When he met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky last month, Trump urged the Ukrainian to strike a quick compromise with Putin over eastern Ukraine, where Russian-backed rebels have seized a chunk of territory.
Ukrainians noted that Trump didn't offer to support them as they bargained with their larger, more powerful neighbor. His natural sympathies, it appeared, were still with Putin, not Zelensky.
Meanwhile, the U.S. president has never given up his quest to overturn the intelligence community's finding that Russia attempted to help him win the 2016 election.
"It all goes back to his obsession with legitimacy," a former White House official told me last week. "He cannot stand the idea that his election might have been illegitimate."
That pursuit has enmeshed Ukraine as well, thanks to an alt-right conspiracy theory and a Russian propaganda campaign.
In 2016, immediately after the Democratic National Committee reported that its computers had been hacked, Russia's semiofficial television outlet RT charged that CrowdStrike, the private firm that analyzed the hack, was owned by an anti-Russian emigre.
Over time, some Trump supporters charged that CrowdStrike was controlled by a Ukrainian billionaire and had even spirited a DNC computer server to Kyiv.
There is no evidence that any of that is true. But the conspiracy theory made its way to Trump, who latched on to it.
After his meeting with Putin in Helsinki, Finland, in July 2018, Trump was asked whether he had admonished Russia to stay out of future U.S. elections. His response was odd: "I want to know, where is the server? And what is the server saying?"
Trump's personal attorney and private investigator, Rudolph W. Giuliani, appears to have fed the president's suspicion of Ukraine and its new president, Zelensky.
"Ukrainians helped the DNC and Hillary operatives to get, in some cases, false, dirty information about the Trump campaign," Giuliani said in May. "[Zelensky] is surrounded by people who are enemies of the president."
About the same time, the New York Times reported, Trump told aides that he didn't trust Zelensky's new government.
"They're terrible people," he said, according to the newspaper. "They're all corrupt and they tried to take me down."
That was the backdrop to Trump's seemingly odd request to Zelensky to investigate CrowdStrike in their now-famous July 25 telephone call.
"I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say CrowdStrike," Trump said, according to the White House summary of the conversation. "The server, they say Ukraine has it."
There's even more at stake in this scandal than whether Trump used U.S. military aid as a lever for personal political gain and whether the House will consider that grounds for impeachment.
Ukraine's independence from Moscow is on the line too.
If Trump hands Putin a win in Ukraine, deliberately or inadvertently, the Russian president's return from his investment in the 2016 U.S. election may well be greater than even he dared to dream.

Texto completo: Oh, Anonymous. ... we hardly knew ye.
This past week it was revealed that the unnamed senior official in the Trump administration who penned a controversial (and not entirely helpful) 2016 op-ed in The New York Times would be making an ever bigger non-name for him- or herself with the release of “A Warning" — billed as “an unprecedented behind-the-scenes portrait of the Trump presidency."
That original op-ed, titled, “I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration," unpacked, to an ultimately unsatisfying extent, the “test" facing Trump and his presidency: “The dilemma — which he does not fully grasp —," wrote Whoever, “is that many of the senior officials in his own administration are working diligently from within to frustrate parts of his agenda and his worst inclinations."
Putting momentarily aside the irreparable damage already sustained by the word “many" under this president, and the likelihood that many of Trump's senior officials now spend their days searching indeed.com, the credibility of the Anonymous author was instantly declared iffy by many Times readers. Not to mention the revelations therein hardly qualified for that word: “Meetings with him veer off topic and off the rails, he engages in repetitive rants, and his impulsiveness results in half-baked, ill-informed and occasionally reckless decisions that have to be walked back."
Jeez, tell us something we don't know. (Like your name. That would be good.)
And now, with the tease of “A Warning" — set to arrive in November unless a troupe of Freedom Caucus jokers blockade every Barnes & Noble location with a pizza party — the idea seems to be that this 272-page pot of piping-hot White House tea can simply no longer be contained, the urgency of its message demonstrated by its mode of delivery.
For as everyone knows, in the Internet age, if you want to get time-sensitive, newsworthy information out to a public who desperately needs it (i.e. a “warning"), your best move is taking a few months to write, promote, and publish an unsigned book. It's a no-brainer. And I mean that as non-figuratively as possible.
And while the blower of this particular whistle has confirmed through representation that a “substantial" amount of the book's royalties will be donated to the White House Press Correspondents' Association, the assured future generosity of Anonymous hasn't stopped the Internet from dragging his or her lack of a name through the mud.
It's no surprise that an ambiance of cowardice suffuses the White House and its ostensibly nervous knuckle-chewing denizens. What is surprising is that whoever made it to this height and wrote this book (oh, hey Kellyanne) still thinks anonymity carries some inherent clout or cachet. Those days are gone; buried in an unmarked grave.
Certainly, some of the allure that anonymity once enjoyed is a vestige of history — or, prehistory — when anonymity was the natural state of any mark clawed onto a cave wall, or pressed into a clay tablet, or scratched upon some scroll bearing tales that formerly only existed as speech.
And sure, anonymity in the American political sphere also has a rich history. As one tweeter pointed out, “Common Sense was published anonymously. The Federalist Papers were published under a shared pseudonym. Many of the Founding Fathers were publishing broadsides against one another from time to time under pseudonyms. It's as American as apple pie."
Even as recently as 1996, when Newsweek writer Joe Klein was unmasked (thanks to some crack handwriting analysis by the Washington Post) as the author of the controversial (and equally shrug-worthy) Clintonian portrait “Primary Colors," he went from “For God's sake, definitely I didn't write it" to “I felt that there are times when I've had to lie to protect a source, and I put this in that category" in the course of a few short months. It was an act of bravery , you see. Not its polar opposite.
So, yes, technically there's a through-line that connects “Beowulf" with that note left on your windshield informing you that you suck at parking.
But the Internet, with its billions of unnamed accounts and armies of social media snipers, has done a real number on anonymity. We've seen it weaponized into guerrilla activism, with the amorphous group Anonymous (and its ungoverned offshoots) maintaining the most name-recognition, if you can call it that. We've seen anonymity put to cruel use on now defunct apps like Secret, Yik Yak, and Sarahah — favorites of bullies who lacked the fortitude to bully.
And authors who opt to go nameless now find themselves on equal footing with the hordes of anonymous bots and trolls clogging Twitter, the faceless commenters who traffic in untraceable abuse, and an unknowable number of other consciously unaccountable weenies. (Looking directly at you and not breaking eye contact, Pierre Delecto.)
That is, hiding in the shadows is not a good look for an aspiring author — let alone a hero. (Ever read “Beowulf"?)

That's the number of seconds Google says it took for its quantum computer to complete a complex task — one that the company says would take the most powerful supercomputer 10,000 years to finish. In an article published in the journal Nature, Google says it's achieved “quantum supremacy," meaning its processor can solve a problem that classical supercomputers can't.
But Google's quantum competitor IBM wasn't having it. “We argue that an ideal simulation of the same task can be performed on a classical system in 2.5 days and with far greater fidelity," the company said.
Despite the debate over whether quantum supremacy has been acheived, scientists and competitors are saying that quantum computers are coming closer to reality.
According to the New York Times, “a quantum machine could one day drive big advances in areas like artificial intelligence and make even the most powerful supercomputers look like toys."

And TALI ARBEL
The Associated Press
Over the course of its 15 year history, Facebook has variously ignored news organizations while eating their advertising revenue, courted them for video projects it subsequently abandoned, and then largely cut their stories out of its newsfeeds .
Now it plans to pay them for news headlines - reportedly millions of dollars in some cases.
Enter the "News Tab," a new section in the Facebook mobile app that will display headlines - and nothing else - from the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post, BuzzFeed News, Business Insider, NBC, USA Today and the Los Angeles Times, among others. Local stories from several of the largest U.S. cities will also make the grade; headlines from smaller towns are on their way, Facebook says.
Tapping on those headlines will take you directly to publisher websites or apps, if you have any installed. Which is one thing publishers have been requesting from Facebook's news efforts for years.
It's potentially a big step for a platform that has long struggled with both stamping out misinformation and making nice with struggling purveyors of news, though media watchers remain skeptical that Facebook is
Really committed to helping sustain the news industry.
Facebook declined to say who is getting paid and how much, saying only that it will be paying "a range of publishers for access to all of their content." Just last year, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he wasn't sure it "makes sense " to pay news outlets for their material.
But now, as Zuckerberg told The Associated Press in an interview, "there's an opportunity to set up new long term, stable financial relationships with publishers."
The Associated Press is not participating in the initiative.
News executives have long been unhappy about the extent to which digital giants such as Facebook make use of their stories - mostly by displaying headlines and short summaries when users post news links. A bipartisan bill introduced in Congress this year would grant an antitrust exemption to news companies, letting them band together to negotiate payments from the big tech platforms.
"It's a good direction that they're willing for the first time to value and pay for news content," said David Chavern, head of the News Media Alliance, a publisher trade group. "The trouble is that most publishers aren't included."
Zuckerberg said Facebook aims to set up partnerships with a "wide range" of publishers.
"We think that this is an opportunity to build something quite meaningful here," he said. "We're going to have journalists curating this, we are really focused on provenance and branding and where the stories come from."
At an event Friday in New York, Zuckerberg was asked why Facebook isn't paying all publishers in the news section. He replied that the initial focus was on building a broad set of content and figuring how to compensate publishers with paywalls. The next step will be to add local and international sources to the tab, he said.
In a statement, the Los Angeles Times said it expects the Facebook effort will help expand its readership and digital subscribers. The New York Times said it was a "welcome first step."
Facebook killed its most recent effort to curate news, the ill-fated Trending topics, in 2018. Conservatives complained about political bias, leading Facebook to fire its human editors and automate the section until it began recycling false stories, after which the social giant shut it down entirely.
But what happens when the sprawling social network plays news editor? An approach that sends people news based on what they've liked before could over time elevate stories with greater "emotional resonance" over news that "allows public discourse to take place," said Edward Wasserman, dean of the graduate journalism program at the University of California-Berkeley.
"It deepens my concern that they'll be applying Facebook logic to news judgment," he added.

It’s not just local fans who think that way with the Lakers back … they hope … and the Clippers at unprecedented heights of expectation.
All NBA metrics point this way. So many media outlets have moved correspondents here, the Wall Street Journal’s Jason Gay called Los Angeles “the Hemingway’s Paris of NBA dorks.”
Meanwhile, StubHub listed the leaue’s most in-demand teams, which started with:
1. Lakers.
2. Clippers.
As it turned out when No. 1 played No. 2, it was no contest. The opener was a Clippers home game – and one of the most eagerly awaited in franchise history – but so many Lakers fans bought up the place, TNT’s Reggie Miller guessed they made up two-thirds of the crowd.
When the Clippers brought Kawhi Leonard out before tipoff to welcome the crowd, there were audible jeers.
Leonard already knew the deal here. When he was shown on the Jumbotron at a recent Rams game, he was booed a lot more loudly there.
Not that hurt feelings proved a problem. Kawhi outscored the supposed prince of the city, LeBron James, 30-18, as the Clippers eased to a 112-102 victory.
James sniffed afterward, “It’s not a rivalry,” which is correct. The teams are playing for an NBA title, not local bragging rights, which are soon forgotten, even if it wasn’t the most gracious thing Bron could have said under the circumstances.
Of course, it’s a good thing for the Lakers it’s not a rivalry because they’d be losing it, having gone 5-24 against their crosstown, uh, neighbors since the start of the 2012-13 season – so long ago that Kobe Bryant and Dwight Howard were here.
Last week’s handful of games is, of course, only that, offering no proofs.
Nevertheless, however mixed the portents, they sum up the local teams’ relative positions.
The Lakers have reason to hope again with Anthony Davis’ arrival confirming their status as a destination for stars.
They retain their place as local darlings after decades of excellence, above not only the ugly duckling Clippers but the market’s old-time faves, the Dodgers and Rams.
The Clippers have most of the advantages that have been earned lately, starting with a managerial mismatch.
From an afterthought run by Coach Doc Rivers doing double duty, the Clippers have built the NBA’s hottest front office with GM Lawrence Frank and consultant Jerry West, with a deep staff of highly regarded young officials like Michael Winger and Trent Redden who turned down offers from other teams.
Meanwhile, the Lakers have to show they’re past last spring’s meltdown when Magic Johnson fled and Jeanie Buss and her friends and family took over.
Lakers fans still wince at the thought of West yearning to return in 2017, being left out in the cold and going, instead, to the Clippers.
Suggesting that unrest continued to bubble last summer, Jerry’s son, Ryan, another highly regarded young Lakers staffer, joined the Clippers.
Oh, and Ty Lue, the Lakers’ top coaching candidate before turning them down, is now an assistant on Doc Rivers’ staff.
The Clippers are deeper than the Lakers … and perhaps everyone else … with everyone solid in their roles from Patrick Beverley, Landry Shamet and Ivica Zubac to Lou Williams and Montrezl Harrell.
Leonard slides seamlessly into his role as the starters’ missing No. 1 option, able to create shots out of nothing.
The injured Paul George, another two-way star, will add his own dimension upon his return with voluminous three-point shooting – he was No. 3 in makes last season, behind James Harden and Steph Curry – that will keep the floor spread wide open.
At the end of halves and fourth quarters, Kawhi and PG will meld with the crack second unit led by Sweet Lou and Trez.
Old dynamics are changing in the West. Five-time defending conference champion Golden State had dominated the Clippers, but that’s over as the Clips showed, routing the Warriors 141-122 in the opening of sparkling, stunned Chase Arena.
“This is not a one-off,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. “This is the reality.”
The Lakers, meanwhile, will need time with a new coaching staff and nine new players, experimenting with James at point guard while awaiting the return of key pieces Kyle Kuzma and Rajon Rondo.
This means showing the necessary poise, although they couldn’t have set the bar much lower.
It was a year ago at this time that they started 1-4 and Johnson called coach Luke Walton in for a loud reproach that the press reported, decibel by decibel, turning Luke into a lame duck.
We still don’t know the whole story, but LeBron’s agent, Rich Paul, was already criticizing Walton privately but widely, including to Commissioner Adam Silver, who acknowledged it (“I think he said something along the lines that ‘Luke Walton is not the right guy to coach LeBron.’”)
This almost certainly came from James and was conveyed to Johnson, which is presumably what tripped out Magic into airing out Luke, and there went their season.
In other words, Frank Vogel had better not take his time to get this working, or do stuff Bron doesn’t like.
Everywhere but here, the rise of the underdog Clippers is as big a story as the saga of the once-majestic Lakers – or bigger.
Eight New York Times writers, asked to make predictions, all picked the Clippers to come out of the West.
Four of the eight picked the Clippers to win the title, with three picking the 76ers.
Five picked Frank to be executive of the year.
Five picked Williams as sixth man of the year and one picked Harrell.
With all the local star power, the New York Times, Washington Post, USA Today, The Athletic, Fox and NBA.com have moved correspondents here. ESPN has an entire bureau on the beat.
“These days, almost every shoe meeting happens in L.A.,” The Ringer’s Bryan Curtis wrote. “Nearly every free-agent courtship is conducted in L.A., whether the team is based here or not. In June, the Timberwolves’ unsuccessful wooing of D’Angelo Russell included a helicopter flight over the city.”
For sure, this is where it’s happening.
Now, to see what “it” is.

Texto completo: Former White House strategist Steve Bannon is expected to testify against longtime Trump associate Roger Stone.
Bannon will appear as a witness for the government during Stone’s trial, a person familiar with the matter told the National Law Journal.
Bannon has not been subpoenaed for his testimony, the person said.
Stone, whose trial begins Nov. 5, is accused of witness tampering, lying to Congress, and obstructing justice. The charges relate to his attempts to reach WikiLeaks during the 2016 presidential campaign.
Bannon and Stone were in contact during the campaign, according to emails obtained by the New York Times, and Stone suggested he had information that WikiLeaks planned to release damaging information on Trump rival Hillary Clinton.
The former White House strategist was fired from his position in 2017 but has recently launched a daily radio show and podcast about the impeachment inquiry that seeks to counter a “well-oiled Democratic media machine.”
Stone has pleaded not guilty.

Brodi Ashton: Halloween trivia from the Jack-o-Turnip to how bobbing for apples ruined my chances for marriage

Texto completo: This October, my neighborhood is filled with yards transformed into elaborate graveyards. Apparently I didn’t get the memo, because the scariest thing I have on my house is the drooping string of Christmas lights, which have been hanging there since ... 2016.
Speaking of Halloween traditions, did you know that the game of “bobbing for apples” was at first used to figure out who would be next to marry?
The practice of bobbing for apples originated during the Roman invasion of Britain, where, much like a bunch of strangers merging their saliva in a bucket, the Romans and the Celtics merged their traditions of welcoming in the new year (Nov. 1) and welcoming in the new harvest (marriage) and casting out demons (um… Halloween.)
With only teeth and tongues in play, the first person to nab an apple was traditionally the next to be married. Sort of like throwing the bridal bouquet. Or diving head first into the primordial soup.
I wish I had known this when I’d gone up against Fiona “Fang-face” Frederick, who bit into an apple before I could. Indeed, she did get married first.
But I got divorced before she did. So, in a sense, I win?
Also, can you guess the name of the first person to carve a Jack-o-Lantern?
If you guessed “Steve”, you’re right.
Kidding. It was of course a drunkard known as Stingy Jack. Irish legend has it that he tricked the devil into paying for his drinks, and then tricked him again by trapping him in a tree with a bunch of crosses. He convinced the devil not to take him to hell. But when he died, he was also denied entrance to heaven, because he was, well, a drunkard and stingy. Caught between two worlds, he became lost in the dark, so the devil gave him a carved out radish with a light inside to find his way.
I have a theory that Stingy Jack still lives, and he is my neighbor, who is super stingy about his lilacs. Apparently, my neighbor has a problem with people sneaking into his yard to chop them down in order to make a cheap bouquet. To be fair, I only did it once, and it’s because I don’t like to spend money on flowers.
Wait… am I Stingy Jack?
Moving on.
Did you know that a man named Stephen Clarke holds the record for fastest pumpkin carving in the world, coming in at an astonishing 16.4 seconds?
I have two thoughts on this fact. First, this is one world record I don’t think should go on a Tinder profile, because do you want to date a man who is so adept at carving and gutting things with a knife? And second, I think my son actually holds the record because he stabbed a pumpkin and immediately got bored. That took like 1.5 seconds.
And I’m just going to put this out there: Pumpkins are a fruit. You’re welcome for blowing your mind.
There are strange laws around Halloween. It’s illegal to use Silly String in Hollywood on Halloween.
And if you live in Alabama, be careful about your costume. It is illegal to dress as a priest or a nun.
So for those of you who received the “Tarts and Vicars” invite for my party in Alabama, please disregard. And to that guy who planned on dressing as a pregnant nun… well, you know who you are.
Moving on to my favorite part of Halloween: the candy. Did you know that 30 million pounds of candy corn are produced every year?
In my mind, there are two types of people in this world: those who love candy corn, and those who have no taste buds.
Trick-or-treating evolved from a practice called “souling” or “guising” where the poor would go door-to-door and offer poems, songs or dances to the wealthy in exchange for food.
I say this is one tradition we should bring back. When your doorbell rings this Halloween, I challenge you to demand a song or dance. And then tell the kids to make a bowl with their hands and offer up a ladle of soup.
Report back to me with your findings.
Whatever your traditions may be, enjoy the mischief-making. Me, personally, I plan on dressing as a black cat and walking zig zag down as many streets as possible.
You’ve been warned.

Paul Krugman: The day the Trump boom died

Texto completo: Last spring, Donald Trump and the people around him probably thought they had a relatively clear path to reelection.
On one side, it looked as if Trump had weathered the threat of politically fatal scandal. The much-awaited Mueller report on Russian election intervention had landed with a dull thud; the details were damning, but it had basically no political impact.
At the same time, Trump was convinced that he could run on the basis of a booming economy. Never mind that his claims to have run up the best economic record in human history were easily refuted; the reality seemed good enough to sell as a big success story.
What a difference a few months make.
Everyone is following the impeachment story, and I don’t have much to add, except a warning: At every stage of this process, Republicans have proved willing to engage in stunningly bad behavior. Did anyone foresee Wednesday’s physical attempt to disrupt the House inquiry? The point is that as the net closes in, the GOP response is likely to be uglier than you can possibly imagine.
What’s getting less attention, understandably, is the way the Trump economic narrative is falling apart.
To be fair, the overall state of the economy is still pretty good. Unemployment is very low and job growth is continuing. And while there will eventually be a nationwide recession — the business cycle has not been abolished — it’s not at all clear that we’ll have one before next year’s election.
However, important parts of the economy are lagging. Manufacturing production is down over the past year; combined with weakness in shipping and very hard times in agriculture, around a fifth of the economy is effectively in recession. In particular, manufacturing employment has been falling in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, states that chose Trump by tiny margins in 2016, giving him a win in the Electoral College despite losing the popular vote.
And overall growth, while still positive, is definitely slowing: “nowcasts,” which use partial data to estimate what official economic data will say when it’s eventually released, suggest an economy growing at an unimpressive annual rate of less than 2%. Since elections turn more on the economy’s growth rate than on things like the level of unemployment — unemployment was still more than 7% when Ronald Reagan won his 1984 landslide — this is not good news for Republicans.
Probably even more significant, there has been a dramatic decline, almost a collapse, in business confidence.
You can see this collapse several ways. One is through surveys of business executives, who spent Trump’s first two years being very bullish, but have now become remarkably pessimistic.
You can also see it in the bond market, a much better indicator of economic expectations than the stock market. Long-term interest rates tend to be high when investors expect a booming economy, in which the Fed will tighten money to head off inflation; they tend to be low when investors expect protracted economic weakness and easy money as far as the eye can see.
And 10-year bond rates have plunged, from more than 3% last year to 1.75% as I write this. The last time we saw this kind of plunge was 2010-11, when investors finally realized that recovery from the Great Recession was going to be slow and painful, not a repeat of “morning in America.”
So what happened to the Trump boom? The collapse in confidence began late last year, when it became clear that Trump was serious about waging trade war on China; it continued as evidence accumulated that the 2017 tax cut was a big fizzle, doing basically nothing to boost business investment and providing at most a brief sugar high to overall growth.
But the truth is that even pessimists expected the tax cut to do more good, and the trade war less harm, than they did. Why have things turned out so poorly? One answer, to which I’ve subscribed, is that in addition to its direct impacts on U.S. exports and businesses that rely on Chinese suppliers, the trade war has created damaging uncertainty. Businesses that rely on global supply chains won’t invest for fear that the trade war will get even worse; but businesses that might move in to replace imports also won’t invest for fear that Trump will eventually back down.
I suspect, however, that there’s even more to the story. Business interests spent a long time in denial, but now even they are facing up to the reality that Trump and his team are very strange people who have no idea what they’re doing — and the uncertainty that reality implies.
I mean, considering that trade confrontation with China is the centerpiece of Trump’s economic policy, it’s not reassuring to learn that his trade war czar, Peter Navarro, has an imaginary friend — a source named “Ron Vara” whom he has repeatedly cited in his books, but who doesn’t exist, and whose name is in fact just an anagram of “Navarro.”
Next year’s election should be about Trump’s betrayal of his oath of office. Realistically, however, it also matters that the economy probably won’t be his friend.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Investigating the investigators, the Justice Department is now scrutinizing the government's Russia probe as a criminal matter, raising Democrats' concerns that President Donald Trump may be using federal muscle to go after his opponents. Trump says to expect the probe to reveal "really bad things."

Trump declared anew on Friday that the now-concluded special counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election was a "hoax" designed to discredit his presidency.

Word of the criminal investigation comes as Trump is facing the separate House impeachment inquiry examining whether he withheld military aid to pressure the president of Ukraine to launch an investigation of political foe Joe Biden and his son Hunter.

The person who confirmed the shift in the Justice investigation to a criminal probe was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke to The Associated Press only on the condition of anonymity.

It is unclear what potential crimes are being investigated or what prompted the change. But the designation as a formal criminal investigation gives prosecutors the ability to issue subpoenas, empanel a grand jury, compel witnesses to give testimony and bring federal criminal charges.

The Justice Department had previously considered it to be an administrative review, and Attorney General William Barr appointed John

Durham, the U.S. attorney in Connecticut, to lead the inquiry into the origins of special counsel Robert Mueller's probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. It's unclear when Durham's inquiry shifted to a criminal investigation.

Asked about the investigation on Friday, Trump said, "I can't tell you what's happening," but "I will tell you this: I think you're going to see a lot of really bad things."

"I think you'll see things that nobody would have believed," he added.

Durham is examining what led the U.S. to open a counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign and the roles that various countries played in the U.S. probe. He is also investigating whether the surveillance and intelligence gathering methods used during the investigation were legal and appropriate.

Trump has long slammed the investigation, saying there was political bias at the FBI and the probe was all part of a "witch hunt" to discredit him and his presidency.

The chairmen of the House Judiciary and Intelligence committees, which are leading the impeachment inquiry, said in a statement late Thursday that reports of the change "raise profound new concerns" that Barr's Justice Department "has lost its independence and become a vehicle for President Trump's political revenge."

"If the Department of Justice may be used as a tool of political retribution, or to help the President with a political narrative for the next election, the rule of law will suffer new and irreparable damage," Democratic Reps. Jerrold Nadler and Adam Schiff said.

The change to a criminal probe was also criticized as groundless and dangerous by the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, which has conducted its own investigation in largely bipartisan fashion in contrast to the House.

"Senate Intel is wrapping up a three-year bipartisan investigation, and we've found nothing remotely justifying this," Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia tweeted on Friday. "Mr. Barr's ‘investigation' has already jeopardized key international intelligence partnerships. He needs to come before Congress and explain himself."

White House counselor Kellyanne Conway insisted the review was not political and served the public interest.

"Were other people at the highest levels of the DOJ and the FBI using that office and betraying the public trust to try to interfere in the 2016 election? Was there obstruction of justice? Was there destruction of evidence? I think we all have an interest in knowing that," she said.

Mueller's investigation shadowed Trump's presidency for nearly two years.

The special counsel, appointed by Trump's Justice Department but repeatedly criticized and undercut by the president, determined that the Russian government interfered in the 2016 election, but his investigation didn't find sufficient evidence to establish a criminal conspiracy between Trump's campaign and Russia.

Mueller also examined 10 possible instances of obstruction of justice and has pointedly said he could not exonerate the president.

The New York Times first reported that Durham's inquiry had become a criminal investigation.

The FBI's counterintelligence investigation -- which later became the Mueller probe -- was triggered, in part, by a tip from an Australian diplomat, Alexander Downer. George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign adviser, had told Downer in May 2016 that Russia had thousands of stolen emails that would be potentially damaging to election opponent Hillary Clinton.

Papadopoulos, who served as a foreign policy adviser to Trump's campaign, had learned from a Maltese professor, Joseph Mifsud, that Russia had "dirt" on Clinton in the form of the stolen emails. The FBI's investigation into potential coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign later morphed into part of Mueller's probe.

Papadopoulos later pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about the conversation with Mifsud and served a nearly two-week sentence in federal prison.

The Justice Department has said Trump recently made several calls at Barr's request to foreign leaders, including Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, to help the attorney general with the current Durham investigation of the investigation.

Barr also traveled with Durham to Italy in August and September, and the two met with Italian intelligence officials to seek information about the activities of FBI agents assigned there, Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte said Wednesday.

Mifsud and Papadopoulos first met in Italy in 2016.

Texto completo: It was remembered as Rudy Giuliani's finest moment.
It was the afternoon of Sept. 11, 2001. The twin towers were gone. Thousands dead, many thousands more presumed killed. The United States, and New York City in particular, was gripped with fear.
Giuliani, in the final months of his eight years as mayor of New York City, was discussing the attacks at a news conference. All eyes in the nation, maybe the world, were on him.
"The city's going to survive, we're going to get through it," said the grim-faced mayor. "It's going to be a very, very difficult time. I don't think we yet know the pain we're going to feel when we find out who we lost. But the thing we have to focus on now is getting the city through this and surviving and being stronger for it."
Eighteen years later, Giuliani was in a very different mode as he embarked on a media blitz to defend President Donald Trump amid the escalating Ukraine scandal. The former mayor accused Fox News White House correspondent John Roberts of providing "distorted" coverage and called former Vice President Joe Biden "Slimy Joe." He performed a mock impersonation of U.S. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J.. He sparred with liberal radio host Christopher Hahn on Laura Ingraham's Fox TV show.
"Shut up, moron. Shut up. Shut up," Giuliani told Hahn. "You don't know what you're talking about, idiot."
To some who have known him for decades, that's the same Giuliani they remember.
"He was always a malicious f---," said Fernando Ferrer, the borough president of the Bronx from 1987 to 2001.
But to many others, the Rudy Giuliani of the Donald Trump era — first as a campaign surrogate and now as the president's personal attorney and investigator — has been far from the calm and measured figure who helped lead the nation through the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. He has embraced the president's "witch hunt" language and been widely mocked for his erratic and sometimes contradictory television appearances.
His aggressive defense of Trump in the face of impeachment has left many Americans, including some of his own former campaign and mayoral staff, wondering how "America's Mayor" has gambled his legacy to serve as an attack dog for a deeply unpopular president and push a widely discredited claim that has become the focus of a House impeachment inquiry.
Giuliani's role as Trump's arch-defender has also raised questions about the business dealings of a man who once pleaded poverty but since entering private life has amassed millions through speeches, security and legal services and, according to reports, relationships with Russian oligarchs, Ukrainian investors and the Qatari government.
Now Giuliani, once known as a corruption-busting prosecutor who brought down mob figures, is being investigated for his overseas business dealings by the Southern District of New York, the office he once commanded. Two Ukrainian-born associates of Giuliani's, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, were indicted last week on charges of funneling foreign campaign contributions to a Super PAC supporting Trump.
Parnas and Fruman also helped connect Giuliani with figures in Ukraine in his quest to dig up dirt on Trump's Democratic rival Joe Biden, according to multiple reports.
Giuliani, who could not be reached for comment, was not charged and has not been accused of criminal wrongdoing.
Reactions from Giuliani's former associates about his new role as Trump's defender-in-chief run the gamut from dismay to full-throated support. Giuliani has squandered the sense of goodwill he engendered after he led the city following the 9/11 attacks, one camp says. The other says the ex-mayor is doing the job the media won't: exposing corruption among Democrats and revealing that the years-long investigation into Russia's role in the 2016 presidential race was a witch hunt targeting Trump.
"He's not doing anything that he hasn't done his whole career," said longtime Giuliani ally and former New York City police commissioner Bernard Kerik, who in 2010 was sentenced to four years in federal prison after admitting he used his position to get a company to pay for renovations of his home. "He's very aggressive. He's a very smart attorney. He is defending his client the best way he sees fit. If I was in the president's position, I wouldn't want anyone else in that position over him."
Walter Mack is an attorney who worked under Giuliani in the U.S. attorney's office as chief of its organized crime unit, and later as a deputy police commissioner during Giuliani's first term as mayor. Giuliani ousted him from both jobs. Giuliani canned him the first time after Mack openly criticized him for seeking too much publicity, which The Village Voice's Tom Robbins in 2006 compared to "trying to tell Donald Trump to stay out of tabloid gossip columns."
Giuliani's mayoral predecessor, David Dinkins, hired Mack as deputy police commissioner in 1994, a gig he lost one year into Giuliani's mayoralty. Mack still remembers being dispatched twice, but said he's not going to criticize his former boss.
"I think he's taken some risks but you do that as a defense lawyer for a client," Mack said. "You take risks if you think it's going to serve your client's interests ... His job is to defend the president."
Ken Frydman counts himself among the former Giuliani associates who is now appalled at his behavior. Frydman, press secretary for Giuliani's 1993 mayoral bid, went public with his disenchantment in an Oct. 7 op-ed in The New York Times criticizing Giuliani's defense of Trump.
Giuliani "cleaned up the city" and made it safer, creating a legacy that is at risk now because of his representation of Trump, Frydman said. In his media appearances defending the president, Frydman said, Giuliani is not acting like the mayor he knew.
"He sounded like Trump and he looks like a right-wing conspiracy nut. He's shuffling papers and he's screaming and he's yelling," Frydman said in an interview. "The guy I worked with was measured and a master of message control and discipline."
Mack, while defending Giuliani, echoed Frydman's thoughts on how Giuliani appears when he's defending the president on Fox News. If he ran into Giuliani today, Mack said, he'd ask him whether he's OK.
"I'm concerned about him," Mack said. "I think some people are worried about whether he's too much into this."
Kerik brushed aside any worries about Giuliani's state of mind.
"I know Ken thinks he's lost his f---ing mind," Kerik said. "But in reality, as somebody that's talked to him regularly, I probably talk to him every other day, I don't see anything different about him other than the fact that he's much more vocal today."
Giuliani, who made headlines as a mob-busting, tough-on-Wall Street prosecutor after he was appointed U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York in 1983, captured New York City Hall in 1993 by ousting Dinkins (who had defeated Giuliani four years prior). He was the first Republican elected mayor of the city in nearly 30 years.
Democrats who dealt with him during his mayoral term do not share Frydman's sentiment that Giuliani has changed since his days at Gracie Mansion.
Council members who served during Giuliani's reign say they are flummoxed by this idea that the Giuliani they see on Fox News defending Trump is a different Giuliani than once led New York City.
"Rudy's a mean man," said Sal Albanese, a Brooklyn councilman for 16 years. "He's been a mean man, unethical man, a liar, his entire career."
Albanese and Ferrer, the former Bronx borough president ticked off a list of controversies they said show Giuliani's true character: falsely alleging a youth commissioner appointed by his predecessor of a crime; hiring the unqualified son of a political buddy to run the city's Housing Development Corporation; myriad divisive comments about the city's black community; and hiring Kerik.
Albanese acknowledged Giuliani seems "more unhinged" now, but said the Rudy he sees on Fox News is the same Rudy he tussled with at New York City Hall.
"His core is still there," he said. "The ends justify the means, authoritarian streak, constantly lying, distorting, dissembling — that was always there. And unfortunately, he's got Trump's ear."
Ruth Messinger is the former Manhattan Borough Council President who unsuccessfully challenged Giuliani in the 1997 mayor's race. Messinger said Giuliani's former associates who see a change in him now remember his corruption-busting early days as mayor, and his steady leadership in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, but not much in between. From the last year of his first term through his second, Messinger said, Giuliani did not use his political skills for the good of New Yorkers.
"The idea of a crusader, somebody against corruption, somebody who's determined to shake things up and produce results, was not a throughline for his years as mayor," Messinger said.
Giuliani, who won his first mayoral race in 1993 in a squeaker then won re-election by a wide margin, saw his popularity dip toward the end of his second term as mayor. In 1998, a New York Times/CBS News poll said nearly two-thirds of New York City voters approved of Giuliani's job performance. By April 2000, his job approval dropped to 45% in the same poll.
The 9/11 attacks brought Giuliani national recognition and he saw his approval rating skyrocket. He became a national star, and for a while he was the front-runner to win the Republican nomination for president in 2008, leading John McCain by 17 points in a November 2007 Wall Street Journal poll.
But his campaign to win The White House was a disaster, with Giuliani conceding the important early-voting states like Iowa and New Hampshire to focus instead on winning Florida. He finished third there and ended his campaign.
His popularity has flipped since his high point after the Sept. 11 attacks, when 61% of people polled by NBC and the Wall Street Journal viewed him as "very positive." Now just 12% view him as "very positive," according to the poll.
Frydman described Giuliani as a "Diet Coke and pizza guy" when he worked for him. But since leaving office, he has been much more indulgent.
In 2001, in the middle of his divorce from Donna Hanover, Giuliani claimed through a lawyer that he had just $7,000 in assets. His wealth has grown considerably since then. This summer, legal proceedings for Giuliani's third divorce, from Judith Giuliani, revealed he spent $7,131 on fountain pens alone, according to the New York Times.
Giuliani's rise from the financial ashes was fueled by his post-mayoral consulting firm and his highly lucrative speech-giving gigs. Between January 2006 and February 2017, he earned $9.2 million from those gigs, according to the financial disclosure form he filed in advance of his ultimately failed 2008 presidential bid. In May 2006 alone, he made $1.3 million total from 20 speeches to the City of Winnipeg, Shore Memorial Health Foundation, Merrill Lynch & Co. and more.
Giuliani owns or co-owns numerous luxury properties in New York and Florida.
He purchased a 10th floor apartment on East 66th Street for $4.77 million in 2002, the year before he married Judith. The couple spent $3.2 million in 2004 to build a mansion in Southampton, property records show. The four-bedroom home overlooks the Southampton Hunt & Polo Club.
Their two Palm Beach homes are a few miles from Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club.

Texto completo: David Brooks decides that a "bad option is better than a suicidal one" and would vote for Ms. Warren. Readers offer their reactions.
To the Editor:
Re "If It's Trump vs. Warren, Then What?" (column, Oct. 18):
David Brooks makes some excellent points. As a Republican, I favor many of President Trump's actions, such as tariffs on China and border controls. But as an American, I cannot bear any more of his juvenile nonsense. I would rather almost anyone else as the next president, including (gasp!) Elizabeth Warren.
The best thing would be to impeach and remove this president, well before the election, so that the Republicans have an opportunity to put up a candidate who could continue some of Mr. Trump's policies without his ridiculous and dangerous actions and those very silly tweets. I have had enough of this.
Robert Hackenburg
Mastic, N.Y.
To the Editor:
Dear Mr. Brooks,
It may not be as nerve-racking as you think to vote for Elizabeth Warren. Just remember, the newly elected President Warren will still have to go through Congress to enact her ultraprogressive programs. For example, at the end of the legislative sausage-making we'll wind up with "Warrencare" just as President Obama wound up with Obamacare, a watered-down version of his original idea, but way better than what we had before. And so it will go with all of Ms. Warren's very aspirational plans.
Isn't it great that our Constitution's framers set up three branches of government? I do love our system.
Catherine Clark
Summerland Key, Fla.
To the Editor:
David Brooks analyzes the dilemma facing reasonable Democrats perfectly. I am reminded that in an early debate the moderator noted that since former Representative John Delaney (standing next to Elizabeth Warren) has a net worth of over $ 50 million, he would have to pay Ms. Warren's proposed wealth tax. Immediately, Ms. Warren is seen rubbing her hands together with a big smile.
This was clearly meant as a joke, but Republicans will run this clip throughout the campaign, claiming, "Warren is greedy; she wants to raise your taxes." The point that she would not raise everyone's taxes would unfortunately be lost.
She may mean well, but with these types of mannerisms and her argumentative style, I don't believe she can be elected.
James E. McNulty
Boca Raton, Fla.
The writer is a professor of finance at Florida Atlantic University.
To the Editor:
Elizabeth Warren's policies may seem radical within the American political spectrum, but they are standard, centrist course for most stable and moderately responsible democracies throughout the world. Whether it's a responsible climate plan, sane gun restrictions, or equitable solutions to health care or student debt, most functioning democracies are already inhabiting this "far left" universe.

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO -- Facebook and the publishing industry have long been frenemies: Occasionally they teamed up, but mostly they competed.
Now the two sides have formed an uneasy truce.
Facebook on Friday unveiled Facebook News, its latest foray into digital publishing. The product is a new section of the social network's mobile app that is dedicated entirely to news content, which the company is betting will bring users back to the site regularly to consume news on sports, entertainment, politics and tech.
Facebook News will offer stories from a mix of publications, including The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post, as well as digital-only outlets like BuzzFeed and Business Insider. Some stories will be chosen by a team of professional journalists, while others will be tailored to readers' interests over time using Facebook's machine-learning technology.
"We feel acute responsibility because there's obviously an awareness that the internet has disrupted the news industry business model," Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, said in an interview. "We've figured out a different way to do this that we think is going to be better and more sustainable."
Facebook will pay for a range of content from dozens of publishers -- including striking some deals well into the millions of dollars -- and get local news from smaller publishers in metropolitan markets like Dallas-Fort Worth, Miami and Atlanta.
"Mark Zuckerberg seems personally and professionally committed to ensuring that high-quality journalism has a viable, valued future," Robert Thomson, chief executive of News Corporation, said in a statement. "It is absolutely appropriate that premium journalism is recognized and rewarded."
Another Facebook News partner is Breitbart, the far-right digital publisher. Unlike The Times, The Washington Post and several other paid partners, Breitbart will not be paid, and only articles the site posts on Facebook will be eligible for the tab.
Still, the inclusion of Breitbart, which its former chairman Steve Bannon once called "a platform for the alt-right," provoked outrage from some political activists.
"Today, @facebook, who is still ensnared in the Cambridge Analytica scandal, added Breitbart, whose owner and former President were OWNERS of Cambridge Analytica, as a 'trusted' news source," tweeted Sleeping Giants, a digital watchdog that monitors advertisers on Breitbart. "This scandal writes itself."
Near the end of an hourlong discussion about Facebook News between Mr. Zuckerberg and Mr. Thomson in Midtown Manhattan on Friday, Mr. Zuckerberg declined to address Breitbart's inclusion specifically. But he said, "I think you want to have content that represents different perspectives, but doing so in a way that complies with the standards that we have."
The relationship between Facebook and publishers has been strained. Because Facebook and Google dominate the online advertising market, taking in together as much as 80 percent of the revenue, publishers have viewed the tech giants as stymieing their digital expansions.
Facebook has over the years courted publishers for different journalism initiatives, like Instant Articles -- a product in which publishers provided articles that appeared entirely within Facebook -- and Facebook Live, which paid newsrooms to hire teams of journalists to use and promote Facebook's live video products.
But those relationships soured as Facebook often shifted its strategy, leaving publishers feeling abused when the social network abandoned its original plans. After heavily promoting partnerships for video projects, for instance, Facebook decided not to renew some video deals with publishers -- with catastrophic effects. Mic, a digital publisher aimed at targeting news-hungry millennials, was forced to sell itself at a deeply discounted valuation after its video content deals were not renewed by Facebook.
Mr. Zuckerberg acknowledged the tension between Facebook and publishers, and he said past experiences informed his current approach.
"It's not a one-time thing," he said of the new partnerships with publishers. "That's why the deals we are structuring are long-term commitments, not two months, not one year, but multiple years."
He added, "We think we've worked out the formula through all these conversations where we now can sustainably pay for content."
Last week, Mr. Zuckerberg delivered a speech at Georgetown in which he extolled the virtues of free speech across Facebook. He vigorously defended the company's decision not to fact-check political ads from politicians on the social network.
The new Facebook News effort is being led by Campbell Brown, a veteran television journalist who covered politics for NBC and CNN before joining Facebook as head of news partnerships.
Most of the publishing industry's recent financial struggles can be traced to a shift toward digital ad revenue, which has not compensated for the loss of print ad revenue. Though the tech giants are not the only reason that publishers' revenues have eroded, even small tweaks in Facebook's algorithms have an outsize effect on publishers' web traffic. So when publishers designed their corporate strategies around the whims of the Facebook News Feed, their traffic sometimes plummeted when Facebook changed tack.
In a memo sent to the staff of The Times, the company's chief executive, Mark Thompson, and its chief operating officer, Meredith Kopit Levien, described Facebook News as a "step change" in the company's financial dealings with digital platforms.
"We have long argued that the major platforms derive substantial value from the presence of high-quality journalism and should help support the economics that make that journalism possible," they wrote. "We welcome the fact that Facebook has taken a lead here."
The two executives, who did not disclose the specifics of the deal with the social network, said they saw Facebook News as complementing, rather than competing with, the goal of increasing The Times's digital subscriptions to 10 million by 2025. The Times currently has 4.7 million subscribers.
Facebook is not alone in now choosing to elevate original reporting. Last month, Google announced that it would give priority to articles that broke news or that had invested considerable resources into reporting over imitative aggregation. Google made clear that the decision was not purely altruistic. Highlighting original reporting, an executive suggested, would make users more likely to trust Google and keep going back to the search goliath.
In March, Apple also introduced a paid news subscription product, Apple News Plus, which provides articles from an array of publishers and costs $ 10 a month. But many publishers balked at Apple's terms when it asked for a 50 percent cut of all subscription revenue earned. Though News Corporation joined Apple's product, other companies -- including The Times and The Washington Post -- did not.
With Facebook News, the social network said it wanted to avoid some missteps of past news products, which relied heavily on algorithmically generated suggestions without any selection from professional journalists.
"People want and benefit from personalized experiences on Facebook, but we know there is reporting that transcends individual experience," Ms. Brown said in a blog post. "We want to support both."

Texto completo: The police fatally shot a Brooklyn T-shirt vendor in a nail salon on Friday after he used a chair to hit an officer who was trying to arrest another man, officials said. The officer, who was hit on the head during the altercation, was hospitalized in critical but stable condition, officials said.
It was the 11th deadly shooting by a New York officer so far this year and the sixth in under a month, according to Police Department statistics. By comparison, there were four such shootings all of last year; eight in 2017; seven in 2016; and six in 2015.
Officials gave the following account of the events on Friday:
Around 5:30 p.m., a man went into the Goldmine nail salon on Mother Gaston Boulevard near Sutter Avenue in Brownsville asking to use the bathroom. He wound up urinating on the floor.
Two officers arrived to remove him from the salon. They determined that he had an outstanding warrant. They moved to arrest him. He resisted.
At that point, the T-shirt vendor entered the salon and "engaged in a violent struggle with the uniformed officers," said Rodney Harrison, the Police Department's chief of patrol.
The officers shot the vendor with a stun gun, Chief Harrison said, but that did not stop him. He then hit one of the officers on the head with the chair, and the officer fired six shots, Chief Harrison said.
The man, identified by local residents as Kwesi Ashun of Brooklyn, died at the scene, the police said.
The officer injured on Friday was at Brookdale Hospital Medical Center, where doctors had placed him in a medically induced coma, officials said. Comas are sometimes induced in the case of traumatic head injuries to protect the brain by giving it time to heal until swelling subsides.
"An attack on a uniformed officer doing his duty is an attack on society at large," Benjamin Tucker, the first deputy police commissioner, said at a news conference. "And we can't have that."
Two New York City police officers have been fatally shot this year, both by so-called friendly fire -- one in the Bronx this month, and another in Queens in February.
But residents of the neighborhood where the shooting happened on Friday -- including the state assemblywoman who represents the area -- expressed skepticism about the police's version of what led to the fatal encounter.
"We have a lot of questions," the assemblywoman, Latrice Walker, said.
Robert Scott, who lives in the neighborhood, said it was reminiscent of another such episode that ended with a local man dead.
"It happens a lot," Mr. Scott, 58, said. "I'm tired of it. A lot of people are tired of it." Of the police he added, "They preach peace but they don't give it."
Nigel Morris, 45, another neighborhood resident, said he was on his way to get food when he saw the activity at the nail salon. He described the situation as "way out of the ordinary."
"There's a better way that the situation could've been handled," he said.
Ms. Walker, a Democrat, said that she and her 7-year-old daughter had just left the library and were on their way to get ice cream when they passed Mr. Ashun in his regular spot next to the nail salon selling T-shirts.
Ms. Walker said she knew Mr. Ashun from the neighborhood and was friendly with his aunt. As usual, he had several T-shirts laid out on a table.
"We were chatting about the shirts, and he was asking if I would buy one," Ms. Walker said. "He's an entrepreneur and I want to be supportive. I said, 'Let me go and get my daughter her ice cream.' And as we were walking away, I said, 'I'll be right back."'
Ms. Walker said that she and her daughter had gone about half a block when she heard gunfire.
"Never in a million years did I think that the man who was shot was the young man I was just talking to," she said. "He didn't have anything to do with why the police were there in the first place."
Ms. Walker said that earlier in the afternoon she had been talking with her daughter about how her day had been. She asked her again after the shooting, which had left the girl upset and crying.
"She said, 'Today was a good day, until I heard the pop, pop, pop," Ms. Walker said.

Texto completo: A Rothschild estate in Shandong Province has released its first vintage. It was 10 years in the making.
PENGLAI, China -- In China, the stories about Château Lafite Rothschild are as notorious as the Bordeaux wine estate is legendary.
There are the tales -- often repeated, never confirmed -- of wealthy Chinese businessmen chugging Lafite mixed with Sprite. Or the time a Chinese official reportedly said at least half the Lafite sold in China was fake. More recent was a government crackdown on corruption that turned up huge stashes of the wine, worth tens of thousands of dollars, in the hands of local officials.
But the latest chapter in the saga of Lafite is something quite different: The company behind the famous name, Domaines Barons de Rothschild (Lafite), is now the producer of a world-class wine made entirely in China.
Last month, Lafite released its first vintage from grapes grown at Domaine de Long Dai, its estate in Shandong Province. The centuries-old French winery is betting that it can ride out China's economic slowdown and turn nationalistic headwinds to its advantage with a locally made product.
Wine has been made from grapes in China for centuries, but it was never as popular as other drinks and the country has not been known for its winemaking. It wasn't until recently that the country's producers began to aim for a higher quality that might appeal to oenophiles, mostly on a small scale.
"When I was starting to visit, a lot of the high-end collectors were saying, 'We're never going to drink Chinese wine,"' said Saskia de Rothschild, who succeeded her father to become chairwoman of Lafite last year. "That's really the bet that we are taking: to make a high-end Chinese wine for the Chinese to be proud of."
Still, Lafite's winemakers have been at work during a difficult time for companies catering to China's elite.
President Xi Jinping's campaign against corruption dampened extravagant spending for years, with sales of wine -- a favorite gift among the nation's political and business leaders -- hit particularly hard. Last year, China's wine imports by volume declined for the first time in five years, according to a report by Wine Intelligence, a research firm in London.
For foreign businesses, a second challenge has been rising nationalist sentiment among Chinese consumers. The National Basketball Association recently found itself at the center of a firestorm after the general manager of the Houston Rockets posted support on Twitter for the Hong Kong protests, which the Chinese widely see as a separatist movement. Coach, Givenchy and Versace each apologized after drawing fierce criticism for T-shirts that were seen as having undermined China's sovereignty by identifying the semiautonomous regions of Hong Kong and Macau as separate countries.
But Lafite is seeking to tap into that patriotic sentiment by offering a wine made in China by a mostly Chinese team.
"Throughout the years, we have seen the Chinese consumer change, and 'Made in China' has actually become something that people are proud of," said Ms. Rothschild, a former journalist who has written for The New York Times.
Ms. Rothschild spoke at the new estate, which is nestled among vineyards and apple orchards in Shandong, a coastal province. On a visit in mid-September ahead of the official launch, bright red signs extolling the Chinese Communist Party dotted the drive through terraced vineyards up to the estate.
The 2017 vintage from Domaine de Long Dai is a blend of cabernet sauvignon, cabernet franc and marselan grapes. Marselan is a cross between cabernet sauvignon and grenache that is popular among Chinese wine drinkers.
In a July review of the first vintage, Jancis Robinson, a British wine writer, called it a "very good debut effort indeed."
"As for the wine, it is suitably Lafite-like," she wrote on her website, adding that it was "as bone dry as the Bordeaux first growth, utterly correct if not absolutely stunning."
With 74 acres of vineyards, production at the new estate is modest. Only 2,500 cases of the 2017 vintage will be sold, mostly in China, compared with the 16,000 that Château Lafite Rothschild in Bordeaux produces on average.
Each bottle is equipped with a special chip technology to guard against counterfeiting, which has been a major problem for Lafite in China over the years.
Bottles of the 2017 Long Dai are priced at 2,388 renminbi, or about $ 335. That is comparable to a bottle of high-end baijiu, a grain liquor known as China's national drink, though far less than some older vintages of Château Lafite Rothschild, which can sell for hundreds of thousands of dollars.
On a recent blue-skied afternoon in Mulangou, a village just steps away from Long Dai, residents heaped praise on the Lafite estate for bringing jobs and distributing gifts during the holidays.
But when asked if he would be drinking the Long Dai wine, Huang Chuanjun, 70, a regular beer drinker, shook his head.
"It's more expensive than gold!" said Mr. Huang, who was carrying a jug of soy sauce. "I wouldn't even spend 100 renminbi on it. I can't tell the difference anyway."
The 2017 wine is the culmination of a project that began 10 years ago, when the Lafite brand was at the peak of its popularity in China. "Lafite" has been used in the names of Chinese apartment complexes and even barbecue restaurants, said Jim Boyce, founder of Grape Wall of China, an English-language blog about Chinese wine.
"It's attached to the idea of the quality of a lifestyle," Mr. Boyce said.
But a number of high-end Chinese wines have emerged in the last decade, including Legacy Peak in Ningxia and Ao Yun, made from grapes grown in the Tibetan foothills and owned by LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the world's largest luxury group.
"The timing feels weird to me," Mr. Boyce said of the Long Dai launch. "It feels like part of a trend that's already had its moment."
For Lafite, though, the estate in Shandong also offers a foothold into China's growing market for pricey wines. It features a visitor center and a so-called classroom for wine education, a first for a Lafite estate and a way to promote sales of the company's other wines and overcome competition from Chinese competitors.
References to the Rothschild family, which has owned Lafite for more than 150 years, appear throughout. A video of Ms. Rothschild in conversation with her father, Baron Éric de Rothschild, plays in the visitor center. Paintings by her mother, the artist Maria-Beatrice Caracciolo Di Forino, and copies of oil portraits of 19th-century Rothschilds adorn the walls of the buildings.
The company chose Shandong for its temperate winters and proximity to transportation hubs, bucking a trend among other wine producers that gravitated toward China's western regions.
But the site came with challenges. The winemakers have had to find a balance between the heavy monsoon rains in the summer and the dry spring seasons. There have also been recurring thefts of grapes by locals. Now, five guards watch over the vineyards at night.
And, as is often the case for foreign companies in China, managing relations with the government was tricky at times. Patience and precision, both crucial in making great wine, can be anathema to local officials who often have short-term growth targets.
In Penglai, hopes are high that the winery will spur the development of a tourism area similar to Napa Valley in California. Already, a medley of projects, including a Roman Colosseum look-alike, a development called Napa Village and a French-inspired chateau have sprung up in the area surrounding Domaine de Long Dai.
"We had a lot of pressure from local officials to open," said Olivier Trégoat, technical director of Lafite's properties outside Bordeaux. "I would definitely have waited."

Turning the Auditors' Auditor Partisan

Texto completo: What is happening at the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board should alarm everyone. The Trump administration is eroding its independence.
In Washington, they often say that personnel is policy. When the president appoints someone to lead and staff a department, agency or board, that is often the surest way for him to control it.
By that rule of thumb, what is happening at the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board -- the body tasked with auditing the auditors -- should alarm the investing public and anyone who cares about objective and experienced oversight of the audit profession.
President Trump's appointed chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Jay Clayton, this month announced that he had replaced a well-regarded and experienced member of the accounting board, Kathleen Hamm, with Rebekah Goshorn Jurata, a policy aide and Republican political regular who had been serving on Mr. Trump's National Economic Council.
In addition, Mr. Clayton has placed S.E.C. Commissioner Hester Peirce, a regulation skeptic, in charge of coordination efforts with the board -- a signal that the S.E.C. is seeking to pull it into its efforts to weaken requirements for audits of internal controls at public companies. These requirements have proved to be an effective bulwark against sloppiness and fraud, saving the investing public hundreds of millions of dollars.
In these two moves, Chairman Clayton demonstrates far too much political deference to the White House.
The P.C.A.O.B.'s work deserves to be overseen by independent experts -- the stakes are too great to have even one seat on the board occupied by someone who lacks the requisite experience or insight.
For example, all five board members should have direct experience with the audit process -- whether as auditors themselves or as members of an audit committee -- or meaningful work drafting and rolling out securities regulation. Ms. Jurata's qualifications are chiefly political. Ms. Hamm, the commissioner she will replace, had not only the requisite experience for the role but also significant understanding of cybersecurity issues -- an emerging and critical area of weakness in our nation's securities regulation. Now that portfolio may go unfilled.
As with other independent agencies and functions within the federal government, even politically appointed leaders like Chairman Clayton must always weigh political loyalties against the mission of the agency they are sworn to lead.
In the case of the P.C.A.O.B., this is a relatively little-known agency tasked with an awesome responsibility: to bring some measure of accountability to a profession whose work is not only at the core of our free market system but also requires oversight and correction. After all, the Big Four audit firms still make mistakes -- the deficiency rate of their audits inspected by the P.C.A.O.B. is roughly 30 percent, according to accounting board figures reviewed by a former S.E.C. chief accountant, Lynn Turner.
Remember, the P.C.A.O.B. was set up in the wake of the Enron and WorldCom auditing disasters. Before the board's creation in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, there was little oversight of the audit profession at all. Auditors fought its creation and settled for it as an alternative to outright government oversight of the profession. The P.C.A.O.B. is a hybrid: It is a private-sector, self-funded (through fees paid by audited companies) nonprofit. And in the end, the S.E.C. has to approve any regulations approved by the accounting board.
That's a lot of political oversight for a nonpolitical board, and even so, the auditing profession has sought to check the P.C.A.O.B.'s powers, as it did in 2012, as the board's chairman at the time, James Doty, cited auditor quality problems following the 2007-09 financial crisis.
Chairman Clayton of the S.E.C. is weakening the accounting board at a particularly critical time: Even sophisticated venture capital and private equity investors are regularly surprised by the shoddy practices at pre-I.P.O. companies they oversee closely, like WeWork. What chance do ordinary investors have if auditor quality is not checked closely?
The P.C.A.O.B. is the only body that has the power to force auditors to explain their work and justify their findings. In our market system, investors have to trust that the independent auditor is truly independent -- and the accounting board must enforce that standard.
Yet the P.C.A.O.B. is doing less oversight and inspection work than it once did, and key positions at the agency are unfilled. Morale is reportedly low.
And then there's the more prosaic but no less important work of the board. Members of the auditing profession would love nothing more than to see their P.C.A.O.B. audit quality inspections get a little softer and more deferential. They wouldn't mind having a friendlier ear on the board when it comes to patching up the holes that the P.C.A.O.B.'s inspectors expose -- what is called the remediation process. They would love to have a solid majority of board members ready to vote on any new carve-out of audit requirements for companies that have a good story to tell (except when it comes to their income statements).
In short, what's at risk isn't a specific regulatory function of the P.C.A.O.B.; it's the independence and the credibility of the board and its staff as a whole. If the Trump White House's goal is to strip the P.C.A.O.B. of its power, it doesn't have to write new rules or pass new laws. It has only to nominate board members who don't want to exercise the power they have. That's all it takes -- and I worry it's happening right before our very eyes.
Mr. Levitt was chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission from 1993 to 2001.

Texto completo: The (sort of) Los Angeles Chargers are on the road again this week, which isn’t such a bad thing for fans of the former San Diego franchise.
Seems like the Chargers are always on the road. Even when they’re home.
That was evident this month when Pittsburgh Steelers fans filled most seats at the converted soccer stadium that is the team’s temporary home.
Things got so bad that the Steelers theme song was played, so bad that linebacker T.J. Watt thanked Pittsburgh fans afterward for being so loud the Chargers had to use a silent count – in their own stadium.
“Helped us out a lot guys, thanks,” Watt said.
That’s life so far in the big city for the Chargers, who haven’t exactly taken Los Angeles by storm.
Three seasons into what might have been the most ill-advised move in NFL history, the Chargers are a team in a desperate search of a fan base.
Their temporary stadium is overrun on game days by fans wearing the other team’s colors, even though it seats only 27,000. Finding someone wearing a Philip Rivers jersey is harder than snagging a parking spot near the beach on a hot summer weekend.
The sad thing is, it didn’t need to happen.
The Chargers were the undisputed No. 1 team in San Diego for more than a half century, selling out most games and building a following that was passed down from one generation to the next.
Fans in San Diego were fiercely proud of their team and, unlike their owners, even seemed to like their stadium just east of downtown in Mission Valley.
But Dean Spanos wanted a glitzy new stadium for his team like he saw other NFL owners getting. He wanted new suites and club seats that would boost the value of the team he inherited from his father – even if it meant sticking taxpayers with the tab.
The problem was, he couldn’t bully San Diegans to cough up enough money to build it for him. So Spanos went looking elsewhere and decided to join the Rams in returning to an LA market that had little use for either team.
And now it looks as if the Chargers will fulfill the prophesy of San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer when the team announced it would leave.
“Dean Spanos made a bad decision, and he will regret it,” Faulconer said. “San Diego didn’t lose the Chargers. The Chargers just lost San Diego.”
If Spanos does regret it, he’s not saying. The Chargers owner said in an interview this year with The New York Times that he knew the team would have to fight for fans in the crowded Los Angeles market and would be patient as a new fan base was built.
The reality, though, is that the Chargers are in season No. 3 in LA and aren’t the top NFL team in town.
They’re not even second in a two-team market. Stop LA football fans on the street and you’ll likely find more rooting for the Raiders than either the Chargers or the Rams.
Hard to blame them.
The NFL allowed the Rams to leave town for St. Louis, of all places, in 1994, and for more than two decades there was no NFL team in the nation’s second-largest metropolitan area.
That meant no fan loyalty for 20 years, no fathers taking their kids to games. The Rams are back, but even they are having trouble connecting with their own fanbase as illustrated by large numbers of visiting fans in the stands in the Coliseum for home games.
Meanwhile, the Chargers basically gave up being the only game in town to jump into a crowded market for the sports dollar in Los Angeles. They owned San Diego, which has no NBA team and a baseball team in the Padres that has underperformed for so long it doesn’t even count.
Contrast that to Los Angeles, where the Chargers are competing with the Rams as well as the USC and UCLA football programs. The Lakers are huge with LeBron James and Anthony Davis, the Clippers are on the rise with Kawhi Leonard, and the Dodgers drew nearly 4 million fans this season.
Now Spanos is in LA and he still doesn’t have his own stadium. The Chargers are stuck as a tenant in the new $5 billion stadium the Rams are building in Inglewood, selling season tickets for next year at a fire sale price ($100 to get in, plus $50 a game) to try and fill the place up.
They moved out of spite, upset that taxpayers wouldn’t build them a new stadium.
And now the Chargers are finding out that fan loyalty comes at a price.

'You will hear a great deal': Anonymous Trump administration official to expose private conversations in book

Texto completo: The author of an anonymous op-ed published in the New York Times last year said he or she will include President Trump's private conversations in their forthcoming book.
“In these pages, you will not just hear from me. You will hear a great deal from Donald Trump directly, for there is no better witness to his character than his own words and no better evidence of the danger he poses than his own conduct,” the author writes on the book’s back cover.
Sources told Axios, which published an image of the back cover, that the author, who has been described as a “senior Trump administration official,” was often in meetings with the president.
The book, titled A Warning, is set to be published on Nov. 19.
The author will remain anonymous in the book but has agreed to do at least one interview with a journalist. The format and the journalist have not been determined. It remains unclear if the author still works in the administration.
“I realize that writing this while the president is still in office is an extraordinary step,” the book jacket says. “Some will find it disloyal, but too many people have confused loyalty to a man with loyalty to the country. The truth about the president must be spoken, not after Americans have stood in the voting booth to consider whether to give him another term and not after he has departed office. Hopefully others will remedy the error of silence and choose to speak out.”

Texto completo: Retired four-star general Barry McCaffrey condemned the White House for canceling subscriptions to the Washington Post and the New York Times.
On Wednesday, President Trump directed the White House to cancel subscriptions to the publications due to their coverage of his administration.
"All these people doing it for the New York Times, which is a fake newspaper, we don’t even want it in the White House anymore. We’re gonna probably terminate that and the Washington Post. They’re fake," Trump said.
On Thursday, Trump instructed other federal agencies to follow suit and terminate their subscriptions to the two newspapers as well.
McCaffrey called Trump’s decision a “watershed moment” for the United States and compared the president to Benito Mussolini, saying, "This is deadly serious. This is Mussolini."
Tweet
Mussolini, a fascist, used the press to push propaganda and censored unflattering reports while leading Italy prior to World War II.
McCaffrey served in President Bill Clinton’s administration and was director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy.

Mega automercado Wegmans en Brooklyn e inmenso centro Nickelodeon en Jersey: dos aperturas buscan dinamizar el área triestatal

Texto completo: “American Dream Mall” abre sus puertas hoy al público en Nueva Jersey, y tomó tanto tiempo en construirlo que algunos de sus inquilinos originales, como Toys ‘R’ Us, ahora están en bancarrota , ironizó el diario New York Times.
Finalmente, después de 15 años, tres propietarios, dos nombres y cientos de millones de dólares en incentivos fiscales, el centro comercial gigante es una realidad, a 13 millas de NYC.
Incluye una pista de patinaje sobre hielo y un centro de diversiones Nickelodeon Universe, que se espera sea el parque temático bajo techo más grande del hemisferio occidental .
Eventualmente habrá más de tres millones de pies cuadrados de espacio comercial, además de una barra de caviar, toboganes de agua, una pista de esquí cubierta y más.
“Contará con montañas rusas : The Shredder, Skyline Scream de Nickelodeon y el Shellraiser de 122 pies de profundidad. El parque albergará más de 35 atracciones, con personajes favoritos como SpongeBob, Dora the Explorer y Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles para saludar a los clientes ansiosos, e incluso entretenimiento en vivo en el escenario de Nickelodeon Slime”, resumió NBC News.
Los propietarios dijeron que apuntaban a 40 millones de visitantes al año -a la par de Walt Disney World en Orlando, Florida-, pero los escépticos dudan que muchos lugareños y turistas viajen desde Manhattan para llegar allí.
“A veces, para ser un visionario y salir de la norma, hay que pensar en grande”, dijo a NY Times Don Ghermezian, director ejecutivo del complejo comercial y de entretenimiento.
Hace dos semanas un trabajador murió allí en las labores de construcción.
Coincidencia o no, el calendario del área triestatal incluye otra gran apertura este fin de semana: el mega supermercado Wegmans abrirá el domingo en Brooklyn Navy Yard (21 Flushing Av).
El local de 74 mil pies cuadrados es el primero de Wegmans en la ciudad de Nueva York. Se estima que la tienda ofrecerá hasta 70 mil artículos.
Hace aproximadamente una década, varias cadenas de supermercados hicieron ofertas para plantar raíces en Navy Yard. Finalmente, la ciudad se decidió por Wegmans.
En 2018 ocupó el 2do lugar en la lista de las “100 mejores empresas para trabajar” de la revista Fortune.
En una columna, Ginia Bellafante escribió que la llegada de Wegmans a Brooklyn se encuentra “en el corazón de una paradoja ” para los neoyorquinos,pues muchos denuncian el cierre de pequeños tesoros locales, pero también albergan entusiasmo por los grandes minoristas.

HARV'S LIES &amp; SPIES; Actress McGowan sues over plot to 'silence' her

Texto completo: Rose McGowan has sued Harvey Weinstein, his lawyers and a spy firm, claiming they tried to "silence" her and "portray her as increasingly unglued" to thwart her rape allegation against the movie mogul.
The racketeering lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles Federal Court, names Weinstein (inset bottom)as the lead defendant and prominent civil rights attorneys David Boies and Lisa Bloom as co-defendants along with Israeli intelligence firm Black Cube.
"This case is about a diabolical and illegal effort by one of America's most powerful men and his representatives to silence sexual assault victims. And it is about the courageous women and journalists who persisted to reveal the truth," the 72-page complaint filed Wednesday begins.
The lawsuit alleges the defendants tried to defraud and discredit McGowan as she prepared to go public with her rape allegation against Weinstein before back-to-back blockbuster exposes in the New York Times and the New Yorker in October 2017 identified multiple Weinstein accusers and ushered in the national #MeToo movement.
"Harvey Weinstein was able to perpetrate and cover up decades of violence and control over women because he had a sophisticated team working on his behalf to systematically silence and discredit his victims," McGowan said. "My life was upended by their actions, and I refuse to be intimidated any longer."
Weinstein's lawyer Phyllis Kupferstein dismissed the suit as having "no legal merit."
"Once and for all, Rose McGowan will be shown to be what she is; a publicity seeker looking for money," Kupferstein said in a statement to the Daily News.
"From the moment she sought a $6 million dollar payout in return for not making these baseless allegations, which we rejected at the time, we knew that she was waiting for an opportune time such as this to begin her suit," Weinstein's lawyer said.
Bloom's attorney, Eric George, also slammed the complaint, claiming it "is inexcusable that Ms. McGowan chose to include my client."
Best known for her roles in the TV series "Charmed" and the "Scream" movie franchise, McGowan (inset top) was one of the first famous actresses to speak with journalist Ronan Farrow about Weinstein's misconduct.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The White House is planning to instruct federal agencies to not renew their subscriptions to the New York Times and the Washington Post, administration officials said, escalating President Trump's attacks on the media outlets.
"Not renewing subscriptions across all federal agencies will be a significant cost saving -- hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars will be saved," White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in an email Thursday.
Ms. Grisham declined to provide further details, and it wasn't immediately clear how the White House intended to compel agencies to cancel the subscriptions or how soon the order would take effect.
Spokeswomen for the Times and the Post declined to comment.
The decision comes days after Mr. Trump told his staff to cancel the White House's print subscriptions to the Post and the Times after expressing frustration with their coverage.
"We don't even want it in the White House anymore," Mr. Trump said of the Times during an interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity that aired Monday night. "We're going to probably terminate that and the Washington Post. They're fake."
Mr. Trump has repeatedly railed against and sought to discredit the newspapers' coverage of his administration, including its dealings with Ukraine and the resulting impeachment inquiry in the House. On Twitter and during campaign rallies, Mr. Trump has attacked the news media, calling it the "enemy of the people" and dismissing some of the country's most venerable journalism outlets as "fake news."
Mr. Trump is an avid consumer of the news, and he regularly reads the Times and the Post, according to aides who privately acknowledged that they expect him to continue doing so despite the directive.
It wasn't immediately known how many subscriptions to the Times and the Post the federal government has.

Texto completo: The sweeping deal, signed by the head of a provincial government and executives from a Beijing-based conglomerate, had shocked residents.
SYDNEY, Australia -- A Chinese company's agreement to lease an entire island in the South Pacific has been ruled illegal by the attorney general of the Solomon Islands, reversing or at least delaying a major push into a location long prized for its strategic value.
The deal for the island, Tulagi -- a headquarters for world powers both before and during World War II -- granted exclusive development rights for at least 75 years. It was signed by the head of the provincial government and executives from China Sam, a Beijing-based conglomerate founded as a state-owned enterprise.
The attorney general's office said in a statement on Thursday that the agreement should be terminated because it lacked vital details, such as timelines, and encroached on the powers of the national government.
The statement noted that China Sam had not registered as a foreign investor, and yet tried to secure the right to negotiate with every other Chinese company that might be interested in Tulagi.
The agreement had shocked residents of the island, some of whom feared that China was seeking to establish a military foothold there. Critics of the deal welcomed the attorney general's decision, but warned that China Sam -- and other Chinese interests -- may see this more as a temporary setback than a cancellation of their plans.
"This is just a stall," said Peter Kenilorea Jr., an opponent of the deal who is the deputy opposition leader in Parliament and chairman of its foreign relations committee. "The fact that the contract itself is flawed doesn't negate the intention behind the signing. The intention is still there."
Tulagi -- a slug-shaped strip of land across from Guadalcanal with around 2,000 residents -- has a natural deepwater port. John F. Kennedy was sent there to recover after his torpedo boat, the PT-109, was attacked in 1943, and before the war, the island was the Solomons' capital under British and then Japanese rule.
The signing of the agreement for Tulagi had been initially heralded locally as a way to spur long-awaited development. But once details of the signed deal emerged through leaked copies reported in The New York Times and elsewhere, residents mobilized, demanding clarifications on property rights, plans for payment, and China Sam's plans.
"They were called out," Mr. Kenilorea said. "If whoever took those snapshots didn't take them, I think this would have gone ahead without anyone knowing."
He and other opponents of the agreement noted that despite Thursday's announcement, Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare's government had previously welcomed China Sam executives to the country. And during Mr. Sogavare's recent trip to China, which followed the country's decision to cut ties with Taiwan and establish formal relations with Beijing, he met with China Sam's senior leaders.
The company has not commented on its plans and could not be immediately reached Friday for comment.
But Mr. Kenilorea said there were many other deals in motion between Chinese investors and the Solomon Islands' government that also deserve more scrutiny.
Five memorandums of understanding were signed with Chinese entities after the Solomons cut diplomatic ties with Taiwan. But beyond broad-brush descriptions, few details are known. Mr. Kenilorea said he was still waiting for a response to his request for copies of the actual agreements.
Earlier this week, the government held a news conference about the national telecom provider, where officials suggested working with Huawei, the Chinese technology giant, whose products the Trump administration has contended could be used by the Chinese government for spying.
"Those kinds of utterances reveal to me that their interests go to other parts of the country and other sectors," Mr. Kenilorea said.

Closed impeachment hearings aren't the problem, the deliberate leaks are

Texto completo: Remember the gimmicky “sit-in” conducted by House Democrats in the summer of 2016, when they were trying to bring attention to the fact that Republicans wouldn’t bring gun-control legislation to the floor? The New York Times editorial board at the time called it an honest “protest” by “frustrated” Democrats, even though they broke House rules in the process.
When House Republicans did a similar, but much cooler, thing this week — they barged into a closed hearing on Wednesday to highlight the secretive impeachment process the Democrats are running — well, that, according to the New York Times, was merely a “circus” and a “publicity stunt.”
Huh. It’s almost like the New York Times has two different standards or something like that.
Well, of course it was a publicity stunt. That’s not a bad thing. It deserves to be publicized that Democrats are conducting a ridiculous impeachment "proceeding" behind closed doors.
It’s not a mystery, though, why they would want to keep their hearings low key. There has yet to be a major public hearing that has worked out well for them in their never-ending pursuit of undoing the 2016 election.
James Comey lied to Congress. Michael Cohen embarrassed himself. And do we even need to mention the cringe-inducing performance of their now-former hero Robert Mueller?
Every one of them was a disaster.
Better that Democrats hold a bunch of hush-hush hearings, leak the things they know the media will want to hear, — such as the written opening testimony of former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor — and decide later on who will play best on camera for yet more hearings in public.
The New York Times on Wednesday defended the closed process by Democrats with laughable logic. “There are, in fact, plenty of good reasons Democrats are operating behind closed doors for now,” the paper said. “The House’s impeachment inquiry is not a trial. It is more akin to a grand jury proceeding, where information is gathered and considered for the purposes of handing up an indictment. “
No one said it was a trial. But the House is referred to as “the People’s House” for a reason. We’re all supposed to be invited to know what’s going on there. It would be one thing if we could count on private hearings with no leaks, but we can’t, as proven this week with the leak of Taylor’s opening testimony.
Democrats can run their goofy show however they want. They have the power in the House right now. But Republicans are right to draw attention to the absurd level of secrecy and staging that Democrats are devoting to it.

Ambassador Taylor: Real deal or just another 'resistance' hero?

Texto completo: The case for impeaching President Trump now rests largely on the testimony of Ambassador Bill Taylor. His account of events leading up to Trump’s phone call is damning if true. He said Trump inappropriately demanded that Ukraine’s new government help his reelection bid to get a one-on-one meeting with Trump and foreign aid that had already been approved by Congress and signed into law by the president.
Taylor’s testimony clashes with claims by Trump and several diplomats. So should we believe Taylor or the men, such as Ambassador Gordon Sondland, who offer conflicting accounts? Maybe the truth is somewhere in between.
Unfortunately, news media are prone to shoot first and ask questions later.
“If Bill Taylor says it happened, it happened,” New York Times correspondent Michael Crowley wrote on Twitter, quoting praise for the “model” diplomat.
We have no reason to doubt the honesty or accuracy of Taylor, a West Point graduate and lifelong civil servant. But we do have reason to be skeptical of every new hero celebrated by the "resistance" media.
We remember when Trump’s single most powerful critic, the man who supposedly would bring down the president, was paraded before every cable news camera and fawned over until he was convinced he should run for president himself. That was porn star lawyer Michael Avenatti, who has since been charged with fraud.
Avenatti, by our count, made 121 appearances on CNN and 108 on MSNBC, enough that CNN personalities took him “seriously as a presidential contender.” On The View, Avenatti was told he was “like the Holy Spirit” who was “saving the country.”
Even Avenatti’s craziest gambits, such as his wild claim that Brett Kavanaugh led a rape gang in high school, were entertained by Democrats and liberal journalists. Sen. Mazie Hirono called this charge “credible,” and other Democrats called on the FBI to follow up on Avenatti’s claims.
Avenatti wasn't alone among the self-styled "resistance" who went to war with Trump and received wholly undeserved plaudits for doing so. Taylor isn't even the first public servant elevated in this manner. John Brennan, James Clapper, and Andrew McCabe come to mind.
Brennan, Barack Obama’s CIA director, is held in high esteem on the left side of cable news, serving as an MSNBC and NBC analyst. But in 2014, Brennan blatantly lied to Congress and the public when asked if the CIA was spying on Congress to swat away oversight. “Nothing could be further from the truth,” Brennan declared on national TV. “I mean, we wouldn’t do that.”
Except it turns out that he had indeed done that. Yet he is still trotted out as a patriotic member of the intelligence community who just can’t stomach Trump’s transgressions.
Clapper, Brennan’s counterpart on CNN and Obama’s director of national intelligence, plays the same role as elder-statesman-turned-resistance-hero. Clapper, of course, lied to Congress in 2013 about the National Security Agency collecting "any type of data at all" on American citizens. "No, sir," he told Sen. Ron Wyden. He added: "Not wittingly." This was before Edward Snowden revealed that the NSA was collecting and storing massive amounts of data on the phone habits of everyone living in the United States. Clapper was fortunate to escape a perjury prosecution thanks to the five-year statute of limitations.
McCabe is a career FBI agent held up as a patriot who was simply compelled by his conscience to call out Trump’s misdeeds. But McCabe got fired by the FBI not for bravely confronting Trump, but for lying to investigators to cover up his leaks from investigations. Prosecutors have recommended charges against him. Oh, and naturally, CNN has hired him as a contributor.
House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff gets especially glowing treatment, complete with glamour shots on glossy magazines, as a pursuer of truth. But he is a rank partisan who is always ready to use his inside access to leak misleading information. Schiff fooled the media and the Democratic base into believing Congress had mountains of evidence that Trump colluded with Vladimir Putin in 2016. That turned out to be false. Now Schiff is back with a new story, and the media is eating it up. Fool me once ... Hey, come back and fool me again, please!
Still, the resistance held Schiff up as a noble statesman seeking only the truth. “In all the ways that matter for this particular moment,” one New York Times blogger wrote amid the latest Ukraine scandal, “Mr. Schiff seems to be coming off as the opposite of a slick political operator bent on betraying the country.”
That was just before it came out that Schiff had lied to the public about his communications with the Ukraine whistleblower.
So far, Taylor has not been impeached as a witness. But in light of this recent history of public servants and much-praised frauds who made Trump’s life difficult, we hope he will understand if we approach his testimony against Trump with measured skepticism. Too much is at stake simply to take the New York Times’ word on his integrity.
Then again, Taylor may hold up as a credible witness. To all outward appearances, he is no Avenatti or Schiff. In his decades of serving the country, we know of no circumstances where he blatantly lied as Brennan and Clapper did. He hasn’t lied to investigators or been fired, as McCabe has.
All fair observers must take Taylor’s account for what it is: a single account by a single diplomat who believed Trump was behaving improperly. The White House habitually lashes out at the character of all of Trump’s critics, and that is both indecent and unhelpful. But neither would it be proper for us to instantly believe everyone who tells a tale of Trumpian misdeeds.

Texto completo: La Casa Blanca está instando a las agencias federales a cancelar sus suscripciones a los diarios The New York Times y el Washington Post .
La secretaria de prensa de la Casa Blanca, Stephanie Grisham, dijo este jueves en un comunicado que “no renovar las suscripciones de todas las agencias federales supondrá un importante ahorro para los contribuyentes “. “Cientos de miles de dólares”, asegura la presidencia que las instituciones nacionales dejarían de gastar.
The Wall Street Journal fue el primero en dar a conocer las intenciones de la presidencia, pero previamente el presidente Donald Trump había señalado que la Casa Blanca debería “acabar” con las suscripciones que tenga a ambos diarios . Tump ha criticado ampliamente a ambas publicaciones desde que fue candidato a las elecciones 2016.
“The New York Times, que es un falso periódico, ni quiera lo queremos en la Casa Blanca nunca más. Probablemente vayamos a prescindir de él y de The Washington Post“, dijo Trump en Fox News la tarde del lunes. “Echas un vistazo a The New York Times y […] al tipo de reportajes que hacen… Y todo resulta ser incorrecto “, añadió el presidente.
A pesar que Grisham aseguró que la supresión de estas suscripciones significarían un ahorro de “cientos de miles de dólares”, no está claro cuantas agencias federales están suscritas al Times y el Post y, por tanto, tampoco el dinero que el gobierno gasta en los diarios.

Texto completo: El Departamento de Justicia (DOJ) ha cambiado la revisión que realiza de la pesquisa sobre posible interferencia rusa en las elecciones de Estados Unidos a una investigación formal penal.
La revisión que el Fiscal General William Barr ordenó sobre los orígenes de la investigación sobre posibles vínculos entre la campaña de Trump de 2016 y Rusia ahora se ha convertido en una investigación criminal, dijo a POLITICO una fuente familiarizada con el asunto.
La investigación, realizada por el fiscal estadounidense de Connecticut, John Durham , se inició como un esfuerzo de Barr por responder preguntas no especificadas que tenía sobre por qué el FBI comenzó la investigación de contrainteligencia que finalmente llevó al nombramiento del asesor especial Robert Mueller.
Sin embargo, la escalada de la investigación de Barr de una revisión administrativa a un asunto penal significa que los actuales y antiguos funcionarios del FBI y del Departamento de Justicia enfrentan la posibilidad de cargos criminales, derivados de algún aspecto de su trabajo en la investigación de Rusia.
La designación de la investigación de Durham como una investigación criminal también aumenta enormemente su poder para recopilar información , abriendo la posibilidad de citaciones del gran jurado para registros y testimonios.
La medida seguramente complacerá al presidente Donald Trump, quien se ha quejado durante mucho tiempo de que fue espiado durante la campaña de 2016, a pesar de la falta de evidencia para respaldar esa afirmación. Trump también acusó a la administración Obama y a los funcionarios del FBI de traición, por sus acciones en la investigación de Rusia.
Los ex funcionarios habían expresado su reiterada preocupación por la investigación de Durham en las últimas semanas, diciendo que había indicios de que se estaba expandiendo más allá de una típica retrospectiva sobre cómo se manejaban los asuntos de alto perfil. La conversión de la investigación a una investigación criminal fue reportada por primera vez el jueves por el New York Times.
Las revisiones administrativas generalmente son realizadas por la Oficina del Inspector General (OIG) del Departamento de Justicia, que ha pasado más de un año investigando el contenido de las solicitudes de la Ley de Vigilancia de Inteligencia Extranjera que el FBI y el Departamento de Justicia presentaron para Carter Page , un especialista de la industria energética que había servido como asesor de campaña de Trump.
La investigación de Durham parece ser más amplia que la investigación de la OIG, aunque el alcance completo de su investigación sigue sin estar claro.

Navy SEALs have a problem, but it's not my client Edward Gallagher

Resumen: Rear Adm. Collin Green should abandon his fixation on punishing Eddie Gallagher and learn from him, writes Timothy Parlatore, a former Navy officer

Enlaces: https://upfinder.upf.edu/openurl/34CSUC_UPF/34CSUC_UPF:VU1?genre=article&amp;atitle=Navy+SEALs+have+a+problem%2C+but+it%27s+not+my+client+Edward+Gallagher&amp;author=Timothy+Parlatore%3B+Opinion+contributor&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;date=2019-10-24&amp;rft.btitle=&amp;rft.jtitle=USA+Today+%28Online%29&amp;issn=&amp;isbn=&amp;sid=ProQ%3Anorthcentralnews_

Texto completo: Rear Adm. Collin Green was correct when he said “we have a problem” in Naval Special Warfare, but his desire to punish Edward Gallagher is not the solution, it is part of the problem.
Eddie Gallagher spent months in jail for a murder he did not commit. His children were dragged from their home in their underwear at gunpoint by Navy criminal investigation agents. Prosecutors repeatedly violated his constitutional rights. Senior Navy SEAL leaders tried to improperly influence the proceedings and send him to jail for life. But an impartial jury found Gallagher not guilty of every serious charge.
Just before the trial began, Green touted the results of a study on Navy SEAL culture as “properly balancing a culture of operational excellence with a culture of sound ethical compliance. ” After the trial, he reversed himself to say “we have a problem. ”
There was not a precipitous deterioration in the culture, but rather the sudden need to find a scapegoat because during the trial, we had exposed massive leadership failures. Instead of learning from mistakes and holding leadership accountable, leadership chose to blame Gallagher and deflect attention from themselves.
Green’s stated goal of restoring good order and discipline is both needed and laudable, but his methods are not. He recalled an entire platoon from Iraq for drinking on base, yet, according to eyewitness statements, both Green and Capt. Matthew Rosenbloom drank in Iraq on prior occasions. Green is under investigation by the inspector general for retaliating against SEALs who consult with attorneys.
Anonymous sources made a stunning admission to The New York Times that, even after being acquitted, “Green and other Navy leaders were planning to demote (Gallagher) and force him out of the SEALs,” but that they couldn’t execute this unlawful plan because they’re afraid of the president.
OUR VIEW: Navy SEALs want to kick out bad actors. Then Donald Trump stepped in.
Their attempt to appeal to the partisan divide misses the point. Respecting jury verdicts and the constitutional rights of military members is not a partisan issue.
If Green really wanted to fix Navy SEAL culture, he should abandon his fixation on punishing Gallagher and instead sit down with him to learn what the real problems are from his deckplate perspective. Gallagher has experienced both the best and the worst aspects of the SEAL culture, but he loves the SEAL teams and would do anything to help them improve.
Timothy Parlatore, a former Navy officer, is a lawyer representing Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher.

LEADING OFF
Happy Thursday and welcome to the Rhode Map, your daily guide to everything happening in the Ocean State. I'm Dan McGowan and I still kind of dislike Mandy from “The West Wing." Follow me on Twitter @DanMcGowan or send tips to Dan.McGowan@globe.com.
In former US Senator John Chafee's 1999 obituary, the New York Times called him “the last of the Rockefeller Republicans and an increasingly isolated voice of internationalism and bipartisanship in his party."
Chafee died 20 years ago today of heart failure while he was still in office, but his legacy has lived on through a deep roster of former aides who moved on to shape Rhode Island in a variety of ways.
Rhode Map asked nine former Chafee staffers to share what they learned from a man who was known for working across the aisle to get things done. Here's what they had to say.
Catherine Taylor
Job with Senator Chafee: Speechwriter
“Here are some of the things I learned from the senator during the 13 years I had the privilege of working for him, in no particular order:
1. It's important to surround yourself with smart people and let them do their best work. The most effective 'stick' to get the best work out of people is the fear of disappointing you.
2. Own up to your mistakes, promptly.
3. Never say, 'I don't know.' Rather, say 'I'll find out.'
4. Keep a copy of the U.S. Constitution in your breast pocket and the Boy Scouts of America handbook in your top desk drawer. Refer to them often."
Keith Lang
Job with Senator Chafee: State director
“John Chafee was an eminently decent man and I am honored to have been associated with him. He challenged me, but was always fair. He also had a great sense of humor and I still laugh at stories he told and things he said. I miss him and all he represented. The country would be a better place if he were still among us."
Patrick Rogers
Job with Senator Chafee: legislative assistant
“I learned to be optimistic about our state and nation; that public service is a noble calling; that our government leaders have an obligation to make society better; and that bipartisanship and coalition-building is essential to sound public policy."
Janet Coit
Job with Senator Chafee: Counsel to the Senate EPW Committee
“I think of my mentor Senator John Chafee almost every day and still miss him. His example and ethic are always present with me and guide my actions. As I grow older, his bipartisan approach to problem-solving, zeal to make progress, commitment to fairness, and honor and decency seem more extraordinary; maybe we just miss the wisdom, influence and spirit of the Greatest Generation."
Ed Quinlan
Job with Senator Chafee: Press secretary
“I learned what a great American was. This man was devoted to his family, public service, his country. This extraordinary man attended Yale with George Herbert Walker Bush, fought with the Marines in World War II and Korea, and led Rhode Island as governor and senator. He stood by and with his many friends, colleagues, and those of us honored to work with him and for him."
Lisa Pelosi
Job with Senator Chafee: Deputy press secretary
“When it comes to governing, compromise is not a sign of weakness. Senator Chafee believed working across the aisle to have bipartisan support for legislation resulted in better public policy. He understood the art of compromise meant you don't always get everything you want."
Josh Fenton
Job with Senator Chafee: Special assistant
“There were two John Chafees. One was a national leader who was ahead of his time on environmental protection, healthcare, gay and lesbian rights and so much more. The other was the amazing and demanding boss. I started working for him as a 21-year-old and he was Marine tough and demanding, but was also remarkably kind and made every staffer - even the lowest level staffer - feel important. And believe me, I was the lowest staffer when I started."
Scott Avedisian
Job with Senator Chafee: Senate page
“I learned from Senator John Chafee to put politics aside when the election is over and govern as a consensus builder. He stayed true to his values but understood the need to compromise."
John Pagliarini
Job with Senator Chafee: Intern
“When I think of John Chafee, I think of decency, courage, environmental protection, perseverance and patriotism. Senator Chafee made sure that all his interns participated fully in the daily operations of his office and not only learned about the subjects of the day, but also how Congress works and the rich and important history of our democracy. He included us in everything possible and I am eternally grateful to him for that."

• They say grand juries can find ways to indict a ham sandwich, but legal experts say they are often reluctant to charge members of law enforcement. That theory proved true Wednesday when a grand jury declined to indict a former Wyatt Detention Facility captain who was accused of driving his truck into a crowd.
• Shot in the dark: Did you serve on the Wyatt grand jury? The Globe wants to hear from you. Send an email to RInews@globe.com.
• Johnston Councilman Joseph Polisena Jr. tells me he's been approached about running for lieutenant governor in 2022. The son of the sitting Johnston mayor, Polisena Jr. took to Twitter to criticize potential Democratic rival Aaron Regunberg on Wednesday.
• Fascinating story from the Globe's Michael Silverman : How New Balance has methodically built a sports endorsement empire that has the company on a path to become the No. 3 sneaker company in the world, behind Nike and Adidas.
• The Patriots are 7-0, so why not talk about the possibility of Tom Brady retiring after the season ends? (Correction: You may have noticed that today's email ignored one win for the Patriots, but that's because games against the Giants only matter in the Super Bowl. Nonetheless, Rhode Map apologizes.)

Texto completo: Did the late great writer, Pat Conroy's late-in-life marriage to fellow writer Cassandra King make him a better writer?
Just in case you don't remember, Conroy, who died in 2016, was the best-selling author of "The Great Santini" (1976), "The Lords of Discipline (1980)," "The Prince of Tides" (1986), and "Beach Music (1995).
All of these were dark compelling stories filled with angry characters and sad family conflicts.
Conroy had what every writer or aspiring writer longs for, being a great storyteller and having a gift for writing moving prose.
His storytelling gifts were intertwined with a life that was filled with turmoil and with unhappy and abusive family situations. Most memorable was his relationship with his father, Marine Corps Col. Don Conroy, who became the iconic and central figure in "The Great Santini."
Conroy said that his dysfunctional family and abusive father were gifts that fueled his moving fiction.
All that began to change in February 1995 when Conroy met Cassandra King at a party during a literary conference in Birmingham, Alabama. Their friendship began around a buffet table and conversations about food. But when the conversation turned to King's book, Conroy told her to have the publisher send him a copy. "If I like it," he said, "I'll give you a blurb. If not. I'll pretend it got lost in the mail."
King, now Cassandra King Conroy, tells the rest of the story in "Tell Me a Story: My Life with Pat Conroy," to be released October 29.
I will hold most of the details for a later column, but will share some of the story as it relates to the question in this column's opening paragraph.
After a long and mostly long-distance friendship, one that only gradually turned to romance, Conroy and Cassandra wed in 1998 and settled down in Conroy's house at Fripp Island, near Beaufort, South Carolina.
Conroy's close friends worried about the gossip Cassandra would hear about his former wives and girlfriends. But when they learned that Cassandra's first marriage had been to a minister, she joked, "From a holy man to Pat Conroy. Talk about a leap of faith."
Cassandra's writing benefited from Conroy's encouragement. Talking with author and Conroy friend, Anne Rivers Siddons, Cassandra said she was writing a book about a group of her women friends, "real-life friends I've had for years." Siddons was alarmed and asked if Conroy had "urged you to do that."
When Cassandra nodded, yes, Siddons cautioned, "Tread carefully. You know what that very thing has cost Pat. Beneath his tough shell he suffers more about the stuff he's written than he'll ever let anyone see.."
In 2013, Conroy appeared with me on North Carolina Bookwatch to discuss his non-fiction book, "The Death of Santini" (2013), a memoir that centered on the death of his father. He was calm and relaxed as he talked about his writing routine. In the early part of the day, he and Cassandra would each spend several hours writing alone, then lunch together, and have afternoons to relax. He radiated happiness.
And his writing did change. He published only one more long book of fiction after his marriage, "South of Broad" (2009), which got a mixed critical reaction. In his New York Times' review Roy Hoffman, while acknowledging that "Conroy remains a magician of the page," wrote that his traditional themes "have simply been done better--by the author himself."
His non-fiction books such as "My Losing Season" (2002) and "Death of Santini," although they show some of Conroy's fiery spirit, the tone is moderated and sustains an authoritative command of his narrative. These books are two of my all-time favorites.
So did marriage make Conroy a better writer? Certainly it made him a happier one. And, I think it made him a better one, too.

Texto completo: Near closing time Oct. 13 in a pub in Ruinerwold, Netherlands, a "completely confused" and "unkempt" 25-year-old man appeared with a strange story to tell. Pub owner Chris Westerbeek told Dutch media the young man ordered five beers and "said he was the oldest (of six siblings) and wanted to end the way they were living," according to The New York Times. The man had walked to the pub from a farm outside town, where police found five adult siblings, the youngest of whom was 18, had been living in a secret basement, accessed by a hidden door behind a cupboard, for nine years. They were apparently "waiting for the end of time," police said, and the younger siblings were unaware there were other humans outside the basement. The family, including the father, who also lived on the farm, survived on a large garden and a few animals. NL Times reported police arrested a 58-year-old Austrian man, believed to a tenant of the farm and identified only as Josef B., initially for refusing to cooperate with the investigation and later charged him with holding the family against their will; it was unclear where the mother is. At press time, the story was still unfolding.
I'd Walk a Mile ... or 350
Tommy Lee Jenkins, 32, recently moved away from Oshkosh, Wisconsin, to Whitestown, Indiana, but on Oct. 1, he struck up an online relationship with "Kylee," a supposed 14-year-old girl in Neenah, Wisconsin, according to the Justice Department. As their correspondence progressed, he requested sexually explicit photos of Kylee and made plans to engage in sexual behavior, court documents said, but when Kylee refused to come to Indiana, Jenkins set out toward Neenah - on foot. The Oshkosh Northwestern reported that waiting for him at the end of his 371-mile trek were Winnebago County Sheriff's deputies (one of whom was "Kylee") and FBI agents, who arrested him for using a computer to attempt to persuade, induce or entice a minor to engage in unlawful sexual activity. Jenkins faced other child sexual assault charges in 2011 and 2012 and had been sentenced to probation.
Sweet Revenge
During the summer of 2018, someone robbed 61-year-old Akio Hatori of Tokyo, Japan, of his bicycle saddle. He was so angered by the theft, he told police, that he decided to become a serial thief himself - until he was caught on surveillance video on Aug. 29 and later arrested. Police searching his home said they found 159 bicycle seats. "I started stealing out of revenge," Hatori told police, according to Kyoto News. "I wanted others to know the feeling."
Ewwwww!
Halloween came a little early to Nick Lestina's home in Bagley, Iowa. The Lestinas have lived next door to Dahl's Custom Meat Locker for 10 years without incident, but early in October, they discovered almost five inches of animal blood, fat and bones had flooded their basement. Lestina said it would have risen higher if not for his sump pump. He approached the meat locker next door for help, but, he told WHO TV, "They say it's not their fault and told me 'good luck.'" Lestina reached out to the Iowa Department of Natural Resources, which investigated and found that the business had slaughtered hogs and cattle on Oct. 3 and flushed fluids down the floor drain, which is probably connected with the Lestinas' drain. The family of seven has had to move out of the home while trying to resolve the cleanup issue.

Texto completo: Russia's voluminous response to a list of 31 questions about manipulated drug tests is said to have overwhelmed investigators.
A key meeting of a group of World Anti-Doping Agency investigators that could have led to significant new punishments for Russia was canceled Wednesday after Russia's voluminous response overwhelmed investigators.
WADA, the global antidoping regulator, and Russia's top antidoping official contend Russia manipulated a database of doping test results before turning it over to WADA as a condition for the lifting of an earlier doping ban. The Russian official, Yuri Ganus, said this month that "thousands" of drug test results were changed before the data was submitted to WADA for review. WADA, which had compared the Russian results that were submitted to investigators with a separate data set supplied by a whistle-blower, had seemingly reached the same conclusion.
The meeting scheduled for Wednesday between the WADA investigators and Russian officials was to have been one of the last opportunities for Russia to explain the discrepancies. If it could not, the investigators and a WADA compliance panel were expected to recommend to WADA's board next month that Russia face penalties that would be even harsher than the ones that barred Russian teams -- though not all Russian athletes -- from the 2018 Winter Olympics and the past two world track and field championships.
Ganus told The New York Times last week that he suspected Russian officials had made changes to the database to cover failed tests by prominent former athletes who are now politicians or senior sports officials. He said Wednesday that he expects Russia to face a new ban because of the manipulated results, describing the case as "the biggest crisis in Russian sports yet."
Under new WADA regulations, Russia faces being an international sports pariah, banned from competing in all global sports events linked to organizations that are signatories to its code, including FIFA, soccer's governing body. That could mean banishment not only from next summer's Tokyo Olympics but also the 2022 World Cup.
Critics of WADA's leadership, including athlete groups and national antidoping bodies, questioned the organization's decision last year to lift its suspension of Russia even though the country had not yet met all the criteria of a so-called road map to redemption after a 2015 doping scandal that revealed one of the most sophisticated state-sponsored doping schemes in sports history. Handing over the database of results held in a Moscow antidoping laboratory was one of those conditions.
Russia did not allow a WADA team to extract the data from the laboratory until January, and only after turning back officials sent to retrieve it when they first arrived a month earlier. In September, after investigators began to suspect what they believed to be manipulation of the results, WADA gave Russia three weeks to explain how a number of positive drug tests were deleted from the database.
WADA then sent Russia a list of 31 questions related to the discrepancies. Russian news media reports recently quoted the country's sports minister, Pavel Kolobkov, as saying that all the questions had been answered and that Russian officials were confident the situation could be resolved.
But the volume of that response has overwhelmed WADA's investigations and intelligence unit, and WADA said in a statement that the investigators were unable to meet with Russian officials on Wednesday.
The meeting was postponed, WADA said, because committee investigators and independent forensic experts "continue to evaluate Russian authorities' responses." A meeting set for next week of WADA's compliance review committee, a group responsible for shaping WADA's response to Russia, also has been scrapped, a WADA spokesman confirmed.
"As previously outlined, no strict timeline can be given," WADA said in a statement. "WADA continues to follow the process and is dealing with this complex matter as quickly as practicable."
The delay almost certainly means a decision will not be made before WADA's board meets next month in Katowice, Poland, the last meeting that will be overseen by WADA's current president, Craig Reedie. WADA will appoint Reedie's successor at that gathering; the leading candidate is Poland's minister of sport and tourism, Witold Banka.

Texto completo: More than 1,200 people attended the Horizons for Homeless Children Women's Breakfast at the Westin Copley Place last week, raising over $900,000 for local kids and families in need.
As part of the event, NBC Sports Boston's Trenni Kusnierek interviewed Tara Westover , best-selling author of “Educated," who spoke about the importance of mentors in the lives of young people and the far-reaching effects of education. West­over's celebrated memoir tells of her hardscrabble childhood in rural Idaho, where she grew up without schooling. Determined to get an education, she was accepted to Brigham Young University and eventually went on to earn a PhD from Cambridge University. Her book has been on The New York Times Best Seller list for 86 weeks.
On hand for the 21st annual breakfast were Kate Barrand , the president and CEO of Horizons for Homeless Children, Secretary of Health and Human Services Marylou Sudders , Massachusetts first lady Lauren Baker , and Boston City Councilor Annissa Essaibi George .

Texto completo: So it turns out that the anonymous writer of that explosive New York Times op-ed, who claimed to represent a valiant "resistance" within the administration, has written a book - one that its publicist promises will offer us "a shocking, first-hand account of President Trump and his record."
No thanks.
We are far past that.
We get it. We have figured out that the president of the United States is out of control. It is not exactly a revelation that Trump is routinely abusing the power of his office for personal gain, that he is subverting the nation's foreign policy priorities to improve his reelection prospects, that he is enriching himself and his family at the expense of U.S. taxpayers and in violation of the Constitution's clear ban on receiving emoluments - a fancy word for payola - from foreign governments.
We know that he employs lickspittle underlings and an outside network of shady characters to carry out his bizarre and erratic impulses. That he has contempt for expertise and experience, and a curious affinity for murderous dictators. That there is no norm he will not destroy to scratch an itch he got while watching "Fox & Friends."
From the outset, this hot mess of a presidency has produced more than its share of self-serving leakers. We don't need to hear from any more people too cowardly to reveal their identities, presumably fearful that it would jeopardize their current positions or future lucrative employment opportunities. Or, God forbid, subject them to a presidential tweet or two.
And we no longer buy the rationalization that those who have agreed to be part of this administration are somehow protecting us from the unprincipled man-child in the Oval Office - or, as the anonymous op-ed writer put it a little over a year ago, doing "what we can to preserve our democratic institutions while thwarting Mr. Trump's more misguided impulses until he is out of office."
I don't know where the impeachment proceedings that are underway in the House will lead, but they have already produced a refreshing reminder of how true public servants behave. They are the heroes - career diplomats and senior officials - who are defying the president's desire to stonewall the investigation and going on the record with what they have seen and heard.
While Trump continues to improperly demand the legally protected identity of the whistleblower who started this cascade of revelations, those who have stepped forward are making that piece of information irrelevant. These witnesses are confirming, point by point, everything that was in the whistleblower's allegation that Trump leaned on Ukraine's president to dig up dirt on his leading Democratic opponent and back up his crackpot theories about the 2016 election.
Who more fully exemplifies what it means to be a "public servant" than William B. Taylor Jr.? We have yet to learn the full extent of what he said in nine hours of closed-door testimony, but in his devastating 15-page opening statement, the man who served as this nation's top diplomat in Ukraine laid out a bill of particulars, a road map to how the whole scheme worked.
And in return, the White House, predictably and outrageously, claimed that Taylor is part of a mob of "radical unelected bureaucrats waging war on the Constitution."
Good luck with that. Taylor is a second-generation West Point graduate who served in Vietnam with the 101st Airborne Division , who took on thankless diplomatic missions for both Democratic and Republican presidents, who over his wife's objections gave up a sweet gig at the U.S. Institute of Peace to step in and accept one last call of duty when Trump pushed out the previous ambassador to Ukraine under the sketchiest of circumstances.
Because of the courage that people such as Taylor are showing, the administration will be under more pressure to produce witnesses and documents that would tell its side of the story, if in fact there is a version that does not make the president look even worse. And if it doesn't, its refusal will be a kind of incrimination in itself.
Moreover, people like recently departed national security adviser John Bolton - who, according to Taylor, tried to stop Trump's impulse to withhold badly needed aid to Ukraine unless it buckled under his demands - will also feel compelled to step forward.
But in the meantime, the last thing we need is yet another titillating book. If this author wants to sell us a tell-all, the first thing to do is tell us who he or she is.

Texto completo: Most U.S. states have joined the antitrust investigation into Facebook, New York Attorney General Letitia James announced Tuesday.
"Our investigation now has the support of 47 attorneys general from around the nation, who are all concerned that Facebook may have put consumer data at risk, reduced the quality of consumers' choices, and increased the price of advertising," James said in a statement.
James is leading the investigation along with the attorneys general of Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee and the District of Columbia. She also named 31 states and Guam as joining the investigation, which she announced last month on behalf of eight states and Washington, D.C. And she said a number of other states could not yet confirm their participation.
Facebook's home state of California was not on the list. When reached for comment, state AG Xavier Becerra's office said Tuesday it could neither confirm nor deny a potential or ongoing investigation.
The world's largest social network is also being probed for possible antitrust violations by the Federal Trade Commission, the company acknowledged in July. And several news outlets have reported that the Department of Justice also is investigating Facebook.
The investigations come amid multiple, bipartisan calls for Facebook and other tech giants to be held accountable for myriad problems from election interference to censorship to privacy issues that have risen as their power has grown.
"Big Tech must account for its actions," said Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry, a Republican, in a statement. "I am proud to join my Republican and Democrat colleagues in efforts to ensure Tech Giants can no longer hide behind complexity and complicity."
Facebook on Tuesday said it has plenty of competition in the United States and around the world.
"We will work constructively with state attorneys general and we welcome a conversation with policymakers about the competitive environment in which we operate," said Will Castleberry, vice president of state and local policy, in an emailed statement.
Presidential candidates such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, have also called for breaking up the big tech companies. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has pushed back against that sentiment and has threatened to sue the United States over it, according to a recording of his discussion with employees, which was leaked to the Verge.
Last week, Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes who earlier this year called for Facebook to be broken up launched a $10 million anti-monopoly fund. In May, Hughes wrote in a New York Times op-ed that politicians, activists and scholars are all sounding the alarm over monopolies, and that "Mark Zuckerberg cannot fix Facebook, but our government can."

Texto completo: A correction is in order.
Many in the press, myself included, misrepresented Hillary Clinton's comments about Tulsi Gabbard. Clinton did not say specifically that Russia is “grooming" Gabbard for a third-party run. Clinton said more broadly that the Hawaii congresswoman is a “Russian asset.”

In an interview last week on David Plouffe’s podcast (start at the 27:57 mark), the former secretary of state alleged that Republicans have set their sights already on a 2020 Democratic contestant who they believe can be persuaded into running as a third-party candidate. Clinton’s theory is that such an individual would siphon votes away from the Democratic presidential nominee in the general election, benefiting President Trump greatly at the polls.
“They are also going to do third-party again, and I’m not making any predictions but I think they got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate,” she said on Oct. 17.

The “they” and “grooming” in Clinton's statement are in reference to the GOP, not Russia, contrary to what I, the New York Times, CNN, Politico, and many others initially reported. Speaking for myself, this faulty reporting came from a misunderstanding of the much broader context of the Plouffe interview.

That said, Clinton still alleged, without evidence, that Gabbard is a "Russian asset."

“She is a favorite of the Russians,” Clinton said of the combat veteran. “They have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far.”

She then added in reference to the 2016 Green Party nominee, “That’s assuming Jill Stein will give it up, which she might not because she’s also a Russian asset. Yeah, she’s a Russian asset. Totally. They know they can’t win without a third-party candidate.”

Alleging that Stein “is also a Russian asset” is an indirect but unambiguous statement that Gabbard is a tool of the Kremlin.

Lastly, there is Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill, who was asked on Oct. 18 whether his boss was referring specifically to Gabbard when she said there is a 2020 Democratic candidate who is a “favorite of the Russians," assuming Stein, who is "also a Russian asset," will "give it up."

His response: “If the nesting doll fits.”

“This is not some outlandish claim,” Merrill added. “This is reality. If the Russian propaganda machine, both their state media and their bot and troll operations, is backing a candidate aligned with their interests, that is just a reality, it is not speculation."

The bottom line is this: Clinton did not say the Russians are “grooming” Gabbard for a third-party run. Newsrooms collectively got that wrong. Clinton said Republicans are “grooming” the congresswoman, which is obviously different from what was reported originally.

However, Clinton still accused the congresswoman of being a “Russian asset.” There is no getting around that. Reporters did not get that part wrong. They just messed up the quotes.

Thomas L. Friedman: Putin wins, the Kurds lose and our allies are uncertain

Texto completo: On the eve of the Iraq War, in 2003, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain addressed a joint session of Congress about America’s foreign policy mission: “In some small corner of this vast country, out in Nevada or Idaho or these places I’ve never been to but always wanted to go,” said Blair, “there’s a guy getting on with his life, perfectly happy, minding his own business, saying to you, the political leaders of this country, ‘Why me, and why us, and why America?’ And the only answer is, ‘Because destiny put you in this place in history, in this moment in time, and the task is yours to do.’”
Blair is still right about the role that destiny has placed on America’s shoulders, but years later it is also clear that many Americans are exhausted with that role.
After some four decades of a foreign policy built around “containment” of the Soviet Union, and then two decades of foreign policy built around “enlargement” — enlarging the sphere of democracy around the world with the huge excess of power America enjoyed after winning the Cold War — Americans want a break. President Donald Trump is not wrong about that.
The job of the president, though, is to balance the understandable desire of Americans to no longer bear every burden and oppose any foe to ensure the survival of freedom with the fact that U.S. interests and values still require us to remain engaged around the world in a sustainable way.
But sustainable engagement requires us to do at least three things: make fine distinctions, leverage allies and amplify islands of decency. Alas, Trump violated all these principles in Syria.
First, Trump, and the U.S. military, missed the distinction between ISIS in Iraq and in Syria, and that’s because Trump and the Pentagon had put the war on terrorism on autopilot.
How so? It was quite logical that after ISIS emerged in Iraq and Syria in 2014 that the U.S. would take on the mission of helping to destroy ISIS in Iraq.
Washington felt guilty having removed all combat troops from Iraq before it was really stabilized and ISIS had brutally murdered American journalists. But rather than do it all ourselves, we partnered with the Iraqi army and amplified its power and ground forces with our advisers and air power.
That approach led not only to the defeat of ISIS in Iraq, it also produced some unanticipated positive effects in Iraqi politics. The ISIS war became a kind of national war of liberation for Iraqis that brought moderate Iraqi Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds closer together — and gave them dignity that the U.S. invasion of Iraq had unintentionally stolen. And this paved the way for more stable and sustainable power-sharing among Sunnis, Kurds and Shiites in Iraq.
Iraq today remains a very frail democracy — with huge challenges in employment, energy, corruption and governing. But “Iraq today is a different country,” noted Linda Robinson in a recent essay in Foreign Affairs titled “Winning the Peace in Iraq: Don’t Give Up on Baghdad’s Fragile Democracy.” “Few Americans understand the remarkable success” that has been achieved in bringing Iraq back from the depth of the ISIS war.
This doesn’t mean that the original Iraq invasion was worth it or that we would do it again. But it does mean we found the right way to help Iraqis help themselves. It is now up to them to make the most of it.
Unfortunately, we kept the war on ISIS on autopilot. Once Iraq was liberated we tried to produce the same result in Syria using Syrian Kurdish fighters. We failed to make some important distinctions, though. As I argued in a 2017 column, ISIS in Syria was operating in a completely different context than in Iraq.
In Iraq, ISIS was the enemy of multisectarian democracy. In Syria, ISIS was the enemy of multisectarian democracy, and so were Russia, Shiite Iran, Shiite Hezbollah and the Shiite-Alawite Bashar Assad regime. And they and ISIS all deserved one another.
“If we defeat territorial ISIS in Syria now,” I wrote, “we will only reduce the pressure on Assad, Iran, Russia and Hezbollah and enable them to devote all their resources to crushing the last moderate rebels in Idlib, not sharing power with them.” And that’s basically what happened.
“ISIS was always two problems — Syria and Iraq — not one problem, and we should have treated them differently,” explained John Arquilla, a professor of strategy at the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey. “In Iraq, ISIS had to be defeated, because once we broke Saddam’s regime, Iraq would either emerge as a liberal counterweight to Iran” — one where power was stably shared among Sunnis, Shiites and Kurds — “or Iraq would become an Iranian puppet.”
In Syria, though, Arquilla added, “we could have protected the Kurds” and forced the Russians, Iranians, Hezbollah and Assad to have to keep ISIS bottled up there. But we were reflexive in just continuing the fight with ISIS into Syria, and not reflective .
In taking responsibility with the Kurds for defeating ISIS in Syria, we relieved Russia, Iran, Hezbollah and Assad of a huge burden, enabling them to crush the regime’s domestic rivals. And what’s really crazy is that — we did it free! We didn’t even demand autonomy for our Syrian Kurdish allies or power-sharing with moderate Sunni Syrian rebels.
I feel terrible for the Kurds, but at least America might get the last laugh on Putin. Trump let Putin win Syria — and the indefinite task of propping up Assad’s genocidal regime and managing Iran’s attempts to use Syria as a platform to attack Israel. What’s second prize?
But even if you argue that walking away from the Kurds in Syria was the right coldblooded, strategic thing to do, how a president does things matters. By just pulling out of Syria without advance planning or coordination with our allies — and dumping the Syrian Kurds after they sacrificed 11,000 men and women in the fight against ISIS — we sent a message to every U.S. ally: “You’d better start making plans to take care of yourselves, because if Russia, China or Iran decides to come after you or bully you, America does not have your back — unless you’ve paid cash in advance.”
Watch out. Over time, that will not make for a more stable world or a cheaper U.S. foreign policy.
What makes America unique as a global power is that we have allies who share our interests and values — and amplify our power at a low cost to us — while Russia and China have only client states, like Syria, and customers.
“When we suddenly withdraw our support for an ally in one place — with no warning — we call into question our credibility everywhere,” argued Michael Mandelbaum, author of the book “The Rise and Fall of Peace on Earth.”
That is not an argument for sustaining bad wars forever, he added, like Vietnam. But it is an argument for ending them in ways that don’t unnerve your allies: “If the Germans and Japanese conclude that America’s security guarantees are no longer valid, they will each get nuclear weapons — which we don’t want and they don’t want.”
Finally, most everyone now understands (I certainly do) that we don’t have the time, patience, energy or know-how to create democracy in the Middle East. But what we can do and should do is amplify decency wherever we see it in hopes that the islands of decency there might one day connect up and flower into democracy.
For instance, Iraqi Kurdistan and the Syrian Kurdish regions, while they have plenty of corruption and tribalism, are nevertheless islands of decency where women tend to be more empowered, Islam is practiced in more moderate forms and Western liberal education is promoted in American-style universities. In just walking away from the Syrian Kurds, Trump has weakened their island of decency, rather than amplified it.
America is better than that, even if our current president is not.

¿Por qué capturaron y soltaron al Ovidio Guzmán, el hijo de ‘El Chapo’? Circulan varias versiones

Texto completo: Más allá de la versión oficial, han florecido múltiples las hipótesis sobre lo que pasó con la captura efímera de Ovidio Guzmán López, el hijo de “El Chapo “. Tras su aprehensión el 17 de octubre, un grupo de civiles fuertemente armados salieron al rescate de Guzmán López. Y lo consiguieron.
En las horas que duró la detención del narcotraficante, la violencia se apoderó de las calles de Culiacán, Sinaloa (México) y dejó alrededor de 13 muertos. Después de la puesta en libertad, los medios empezaron a hacerse eco de lo que ocurrió a lanzar versiones diferentes.
El gobierno justificó su decisión diciendo que quería evitar una “masacre” en Culiacán ya que los militares se habían precipitado , eran pocos y carecían de una orden de cateo. Según cuenta Univision, el ejecutivo mexicano la ofensiva del cartel de Sinaloa -cuyo bastión es Culiacán- rebasó en poco tiempo al ejército y grupos de sicarios acudieron a las afueras de un complejo residencial donde viven familiares de los soldados para amenazar al gobierno.
El presidente, Andrés Manuel López Obrador , dijo en una de sus “mañaneras” que no se arrepiente de su gestión ante el conflicto ya que, en sus propias palabras, “nosotros no vamos a optar nunca por la guerra, por la confrontación o por el uso de la fuerza. Lo que nos importa es la vida de las personas”. “Yo tengo mi conciencia tranquila y sé que actuamos de manera correcta”, aseguró el mandatario.
Se barajan al menos cuatro razones detrás de los hechos que ocurrieron en Culiacán el 17 de octubre:
1. La intervención de ‘El Mayo’ Zambada es una de las versiones que han citado medios que no creen que la célula criminal de Ovidio Guzmán haya actuado sola. Según esta hipótesis, el capo Ismael ‘El Mayo’ Zambada, que lleva más de tres décadas al frente la organización criminal, ayudó a coordinar las acciones violentas que forzaron al Gobierno a replegar el ejército . Además, el exagente de la DEA Jack Riley dijo al semanario Proceso que es posible que Zambada haya impedido la detención de otro miembro de los Guzmán. J. Jesús Esquivel, experto en narcotráfico de esta misma revista, aseguró que “en Culiacán y en ningún lugar de Sinaloa se mueve un dedo sin la bendición y autorización de […] ‘El Mayo’ Zambada.
2. El periodista de The New York Times, Alan Freuer, dijo en Twitter que, además de a Ovidio, los militares también arrestaron a su hermano Iván Archivaldo . De acuerdo con esta versión, Archivaldo conseguiría primero la libertad y se encargaría de dirigir la ofensiva que acabaría en la liberación de Ovidio Guzmán . Para conseguirlo, Freuer comenta que habrían secuestrado a familiares de los soldados.
3. El ejército mexicano insiste, según Univision, en que sus soldados solo rodearon la vivienda en la que se encontraba Ovidio pero “nunca estuvo formalmente detenido . Sin embargo, un audio viral de un supuesto militar contradice la versión oficial afirmando que “cumplimos con el objetivo de detener a un delincuente”. “Se estima que eran entre 700 y 800 delincuentes -continúa el audio-. Solo 350 de nosotros le hicimos frente”. Esta grabación, adelanta Univision, aún no se ha confirmado.
4. El diario The Wall Street Journal informó de que los soldados bajaron las armas porque, entre los videos que recibieron, uno muestra como rehenes a los miembros de una patrulla . En otro se ve a un soldado ejecutado con un disparo en la cabeza, según dijo un exfuncionario al citado diario. Por otro lado, Marcelo Erbrard, canciller mexicano, reconoció que miembros del crimen organizado se colocaron el jueves frente a viviendas de familiares del ejército esperando la orden para abrir fuego.

Texto completo: Con el inicio de la temporada de patinaje en las dos pistas de hielo en Central Park, los visitantes notarán que la marca “Trump” ya no está.
La impopularidad del mandatario Donald Trump entre muchos neoyorquinos ha llevado a que su nombre sea despojado de algunas propiedades privadas en su ciudad natal, incluido el hotel Trump SoHo -ahora llamado Dominick-, y algunos condominios de Trump Place en Manhattan.
Las pistas, dos de varias concesiones públicas que opera en la ciudad la Organización Trump -el principal vehículo comercial de la familia presidencial-, continuaron mostrando el nombre de manera prominente hasta la primavera pasada.
“Sin embargo, en las últimas semanas, la compañía realizó un cambio significativo, eliminando el nombre de Trump en silencio y sin explicación”, destacó The New York Times.
La presencia de la marca familiar disminuyó considerablemente. Desapareció por completo de los tableros.
El nombre “Trump” quedó reducido a una “T” solitaria sobre el mostrador de alquiler de patines, en letra pequeña en la parte inferior de un letrero con las horas y tarifas.
Los cambios en las pistas, reportados por primera vez por The Washington Post, no fueron solicitados ni requeridos por el Ayuntamiento, dijeron las autoridades.
La Organización Trump -que dirige las pistas Wollman y Lasker, ubicadas en los extremo sureste y noroeste del parque-, informó en el verano a los funcionarios del parque que planeaba alterar la señalización, sin proporcionar detalles ni una justificación.
Un representante de la Organización Trump no ha respondido a una solicitud de comentarios. Los ejecutivos han dicho en el pasado que la opinión pública del presidente no había afectado el negocio de la compañía.
“No hay conexión con la política y el uso de usuarios en nuestras instalaciones aquí en Nueva York”, dijo el año pasado Ronald C. Lieberman, vicepresidente ejecutivo del grupo.

Texto completo: Before the whistleblower, there was Anonymous.
As Congress hurtles toward impeaching President Trump, the nameless official who rocked the White House last year has written a book detailing the disturbing inner workings of his rule.
"A Warning" will hit shelves next month. It promises to elaborate and expand on the shocking details about the administration, including revelations that officials sometimes whisked papers off Trump's desk to protect the nation from his most destructive impulses.
"This is serious stuff, and this is a serious warning about our president, " Sean Desmond, publisher of the Twelve division of Hachette Books, told CNN.
White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham lashed out at the author in a scathing statement dripping with sarcasm.
"It takes a lot of conviction and bravery to write a book anonymously," Grisham said.
The publisher says "elaborate precautions" have been taken to protect the identity of the author. It's unclear if the author is still working in the Trump administration and the publisher declined to comment on that issue.
The original September 2018 opinion piece in The New York Times was headlined "I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration" and was a bombshell at the time. Its revelations included shocking claims that Trump often made ill-considered and reckless decisions that aides undermined or even reversed for the good of the country.
Trump lashed out at the author last year, calling him or her a "traitor," in what was in many ways a preview of his of the intelligence whistleblower who sparked the Ukraine impeachment scandal.
The president even directed then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to mount an investigation to discover the writer's identity.
The op-ed's publication also sparked an intense inside-the-Beltway parlor game trying to identify Anonymous. Politicos resumed the guessing game last night, with some suggesting boldface Trumpland names.

Texto completo: The father of a Jewish boy killed at the Sandy Hook Elementary School won a $450,000 judgment against the editor of a book that claimed the 2012 massacre at the school never happened.
A jury in Wisconsin determined the amount to be paid to Leonard Pozner, whose 6-year-old son Noah was the youngest of the 26 people killed at the Connecticut school.
The award came four months after a judge ruled that Pozner had been defamed by James Fetzer and Mike Palecek, editors of a book claiming that the government had staged the killing to advance gun control measures. According to the book, Pozner had faked his son's death certificate to advance the conspiracy.
Fetzer, a retired professor emeritus at the University of Minnesota-Duluth, called the judgment "absurd" and said he plans to appeal, the Wisconsin State Journalreported. Palacek has already settled with Pozner for an undisclosed amount, according to The New York Times.
Pozner is a party to multiple lawsuits against those who claim the massacre was faked, including Alex Jones, the online provocateur who runs Infowars. Jones has also made claims to the effect that the parents of Sandy Hook victims are part of a plot to take away firearms.

Texto completo: A pair of new shows from Tyler Perry debut on BET. And Paul Rudd plays both a man and his clone in Netflix's "Living With Yourself."
What's on TV
TYLER PERRY'S THE OVAL 9 p.m. on BET. A trailer for this new Tyler Perry show promises money, power, sex, greed, lies, murder, betrayal, revenge and secrets -- words that might bring to mind "The Sopranos" or maybe "Boardwalk Empire." But the setting here is the White House, and the family at the center of the series is a fictional first family of the United States. That crew is headed by Hunter Franklin (Ed Quinn) and Victoria Franklin (Kron Moore), a fresh president and first lady whose sordid personal affairs (romantic and otherwise), infighting and disreputable dealings threaten to spill over into their public lives. (The line "See if I won't put your head through that wall" has a different ring to it when it's said in the Oval Office.) "The Oval" is one of a slew of new shows that a post-Madea Perry has written and directed as part of a major content deal with Viacom. Another one, TYLER PERRY'S SISTAS, about a group of women navigating modern dating, will debut on BET at 10 p.m.
THE DA VINCI CODE (2006) 8 p.m. on Starz Encore. Those who can't make it to Paris for the opening of the colossal new Leonardo da Vinci exhibition this week can get a very different taste of the Louvre in this thriller based on the Dan Brown best seller. (Though that taste may be an acquired one.) The movie stars Tom Hanks as a Harvard professor and Audrey Tautou as a police cryptographer. Both are called to help investigate a murder at the Louvre -- and wind up enmeshed in a mystery of biblical proportions. Starz Encore is showing the movie alongside its first sequel, ANGELS & DEMONS (2009), which will air at 10:30 p.m.
What's Streaming
LIVING WITH YOURSELF Stream on Netflix. Near the beginning of this new comedy-drama series, Miles, a down-in-the-dumps brand executive played by Paul Rudd, kills a fly by swatting it with a manila folder. "You're welcome," he says. The sequence is a fair encapsulation of Miles's outlook, at least until he tries a mysterious spa treatment. That session results in the creation of a clone version of Miles, who is happier and more energetic than the original person. The issue? The original Miles is still around, and has to contend with his seemingly superior clone. Rudd plays both Miles and the clone, a feat that was accomplished with the help of an electronic earpiece, which allowed Rudd to hear himself delivering a line as one character and react to it as the other. "It became like choreography," Rudd said in a recent interview with The New York Times. "I would hear the words and remember my actions, and I would act like I was looking at myself."
CASTLE ROCK Stream on Hulu. This horror anthology series distinguishes itself from other Stephen King TV and film adaptations by telling original stories that take place in various locales ripped from King's books. The new second season includes a nurse (Lizzy Caplan), an aging crime boss (Tim Robbins) and a small town's big, spooky problems.

Cheaper Plans and More Options as A.C.A. Stabilizes From Onslaught

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Nearly three years into President Trump's aggressive efforts to undermine the Affordable Care Act, prices for the most popular type of health insurance plan offered through the health law's federal marketplace will actually drop next year, and the number of insurers offering plans will go up.
Administration officials credited Mr. Trump with the resiliency of the law even as they echoed his contempt for it.
"The A.C.A. simply doesn't work and is still unaffordable for far too many," Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services, said on Monday. "But until Congress gets around to replacing it, President Trump will do what he can to fix the problems created by this system for millions of Americans."
The 4-percent price decline is only the second time that average monthly premiums have dropped year-to-year since the marketplace opened in 2014, and it is a sign that the health law is stabilizing after several years of turmoil caused in part by Mr. Trump. Open enrollment for Obamacare starts on Nov. 1, but looming over it is an impending court decision on the law's constitutionality in a case supported by the Trump administration that seeks to overturn the law.
Premiums rose sharply in the final years of the Obama administration, as Trump officials like to point out, largely because of losses insurers suffered as they tried to gauge the health needs of their new customers. But after Mr. Trump and Republicans in Congress tried unsuccessfully to repeal the law in 2017, the president took a number of steps to weaken it, all of which led to uncertainty that resulted in insurers raising prices.
Now, a correction is taking place. Some of the states with the biggest premium increases this year, including Delaware and North Dakota, will see the biggest decreases in 2020. There will be 20 more insurers selling plans next year in the federal marketplace, which is used by people in 38 states, bringing the total to 175. That will be the largest number of issuers since 2016. Only two states, Delaware and Wyoming, will have a single insurer selling plans under the law next year, compared with five states currently.
For a 27-year-old, premiums for a benchmark "silver" plan will cost an average $ 388 per month next year; for a family of four, they will average $ 1,520 per month. That is still expensive, but most people will qualify for federal subsidies that cover much or most of the cost.
For many of those who do not qualify for subsidies under the health law -- people earning more than 400 percent of the poverty level, which comes to just under $ 50,000 for a single person -- premiums will remain out of reach.
Deductibles, too, will continue to rise, with the median amount rising to $ 4,604, from $ 4,471, for silver plans, which offer midlevel coverage. But people whose income is at or under 200 percent of the poverty level will have much lower deductibles, thanks to a different kind of discount required under the law that helps with out-of-pocket costs.
Prices and other information about next year's Affordable Care Act plans in the 12 states, as well as the District of Columbia, that have their own marketplaces will be announced by those places. In all, 10.6 million people had health plans through the federal and state marketplace plans as of March, the last time the Trump administration released enrollment data.
As the market stabilizes, the health law is coming to serve almost exclusively the struggling families and individuals who qualify for federally subsidized coverage. In a call with reporters on Monday, Seema Verma, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which runs the online marketplace, said that from 2016 to 2018, the number of health-law enrollees who did not qualify for premium subsidies dropped by 2.5 million people, or 40 percent.
"It was inevitable that Obamacare's affordability crisis would eventually increase the number of uninsured," Ms. Verma said, pointing to new census data showing a rise in the number of higher-income Americans without insurance.
In 2018, 8.5 percent of the population lacked health insurance, according to the Census Bureau, up from 7.9 percent in 2017. But that was driven in large part by a decline in the number of children insured under government programs like Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program. The administration has taken steps to limit Medicaid eligibility for immigrants, and has supported efforts by some states to impose work requirements on Medicaid recipients.

The administration has also all but eliminated funding to promote enrollment under the law, through advertising and "navigators," who once helped people sign up.
Ms. Verma and Mr. Azar praised Congress for zeroing out the tax penalty that the law imposed on people who go without health insurance; it did so as part of the 2017 tax overhaul. They also praised new rules pressed by Mr. Trump that encourage the sale of less expensive coverage that does not provide the comprehensive benefits required by the health law. Both moves, Ms. Verma said, elicited "a kneejerk chorus of dire predictions" that had not come to fruition.
A major reason that premiums have stabilized, she said, is the reinsurance programs that the Trump administration has approved in 12 states. Under these programs, states help insurers pay their largest medical claims, partly using federal funds. Three of the states that will see the biggest drops in premium costs next year -- Delaware, Montana and North Dakota -- have adopted reinsurance programs, Ms. Verma said.
A bill to spread such programs across the country was drafted by the Republican senators Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Susan Collins of Maine in the last Congress, but it was never brought to the Senate floor for a vote.
As always, how much people pay for a marketplace plan will heavily depend on where they live. Wyoming will have the highest average premiums next year -- $ 723 a month for the benchmark plan for a 27-year-old, an increase of two percent. New Mexico will have the lowest average premiums -- $ 282 a month for the benchmark plan for a 27-year-old, a decrease of 6 percent.
Asked about the court case seeking to invalidate the health law, Mr. Azar said a ruling in the plaintiffs' favor would not change anything immediately because the defenders of the law would appeal to the Supreme Court.
"Our message would be, 'Keep calm and carry on,"' Mr. Azar said. "There will be no immediate disruption to anybody. We will run the program the day after such a ruling the same way we ran the program the day before."

Texto completo: The California freshman denied a report of a relationship with a congressional staff member, which House rules forbid, but refused to comment on whether she was intimately involved with a campaign aide.
WASHINGTON -- Representative Katie Hill, a first-term Democrat widely considered a rising star in her party, on Tuesday denied reports that she had a sexual relationship with a member of her congressional staff, but refused to comment on an allegation that she was intimately involved with a campaign aide, saying that a nude photograph of her and another woman was published on the internet without her consent.
Ms. Hill, 32, of California, made her comments in a brief interview and a statement in response to a report on the conservative news site RedState alleging that she had been intimately involved with her legislative director, and separately in a three-way sexual relationship with a young campaign aide and her husband, whom she is divorcing.
Members of Congress are barred by House rules from engaging in sexual relationships with their aides, but the rules do not cover campaign staff. Ms. Hill said the photograph, which appears to show the congresswoman seated and brushing the hair of another woman, was the subject of a police investigation.
"Intimate photos of me and another individual were published by Republican operatives on the internet without my consent," Ms. Hill said in the statement.
"I have notified Capitol Hill police, who are investigating the situation and potential legal violations of those who posted and distributed the photos, and therefore will have no further comment on the digital materials," she said.
Conservative critics of Ms. Hill have called on her to resign, saying the photographs posed a national security risk and could have exposed her to blackmail. But Ms. Hill said she had no intention of quitting. Supporters said she was a victim of "revenge porn" -- technically known as nonconsensual pornography -- which is illegal under California law.
Ms. Hill said the stories, which she called "a smear campaign," were being driven by Republican operatives and a "husband who seems determined to try to humiliate me." Her husband, Kenny Heslep, did not respond to a phone message requesting comment.
The congresswoman said she had spoken to Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her top lieutenant, Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, about the matter. Mr. Hoyer declined to comment, and a spokesman for Ms. Pelosi said the speaker was on her way to Baltimore on Tuesday for the funeral of her brother.
Ms. Hill, who campaigned to make history as the first openly bisexual congresswoman from California, unseated a Republican, Steve Knight, in the so-called blue wave that carried Democrats to power in the House in 2018. She is a favorite of Ms. Pelosi, who named her vice chairwoman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, an unusually high-ranking position for a freshman on a panel that is playing a crucial role in the impeachment inquiry into President Trump.
Ms. Hill represents parts of the Santa Clarita and Antelope Valleys, the most conservative district in Los Angeles County, and is expected to have a tough re-election race there. Since the RedState report, her Republican critics have been circulating the nude photo on Twitter, which has taken the posts down for violating the platform's rules against sharing explicit images of someone without their consent.
"She's a victim of revenge porn, which is a form of domestic violence and psychological abuse," said Kat Walker, a gun control activist and Hill supporter, who said she had spent the past several days reporting Twitter users who posted the photo. "We worked very hard for her. I already know I'm going to have to work very hard for her again, scandal or no scandal."
The report involving Ms. Hill -- and the House leadership's muted reaction to it -- comes in the context of the #MeToo movement, amid heightened sensitivity about the conduct of men in positions of power, including members of Congress. It raises questions about whether there is a double standard for men and women who engage in intimate relationships in the workplace.
RedState also published what it characterized as text messages between Ms. Hill and the campaign aide, who was not identified, that suggested Ms. Hill was breaking off their apparently consensual relationship so she could focus on her duties in Washington. If that is true, experts in workplace law said, it might be inappropriate but not illegal.
"Clearly there is an inherent power differential between Congresswoman Hill and a young campaign staffer who worked for her, but there's nothing unlawful about having a relationship with people who work for you as long as it is consensual," said Debra Katz, a Washington lawyer who represents victims of sexual harassment. "But clearly this shows bad judgment."
Some male Democrats said privately on Tuesday that if Ms. Hill had been a man, there would have been an immediate uproar that would most likely have ended in a forced resignation. In recent years, several men have resigned from Congress after stories about their sexual conduct, but those resignations often involved allegations of harassment.
The handling of such incidents tends to vary case by case. In November 2017, Representative Joe Barton, a Texas Republican, announced that he would not seek re-election after a nude photo of him was published, along with explicit text messages between him and a female constituent.
Also that November, Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, was forced out of the Senate after he was accused of groping women, and Representative John Conyers Jr. of Michigan lost his post as the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee -- and was eventually forced to resign after several former aides accused him of harassment.
A month later, Ruben Kihuen, a relatively unknown Democratic House member from Nevada, was accused of propositioning his campaign finance director for sex despite her protestations. Within hours, Ms. Pelosi, then the Democratic minority leader, demanded his resignation.
Ms. Hill's critics have been making vague threats on social media suggesting that more revelations about the congresswoman are to come. On Tuesday, RedState published an additional trove of text messages purportedly between Ms. Hill, the campaign aide and her husband.

Trump's condemnation of violent video is hard to take seriously

Texto completo: Re “Trump condemns violent video shown at event" (Page A2, Oct. 15): President Trump's condemnation of a fake violent video showing him shooting members of the news media and political opponents does not square with his own practices. He has retweeted fake videos showing him beating up a person whose face bears the CNN logo and him knocking Hillary Clinton down while she is entering an airliner.
He has said that if he shot someone dead on New York's Fifth Avenue, he wouldn't lose a vote, and promised to pay the legal fees of supporters if they beat up a protester. He warned of violence if he didn't get the 2016 nomination, and of a civil war if he was impeached. In March 2016, before he was even nominated or elected, The New York Times published a documentary video record, appropriately called “Trump's history of encouraging violence."
Therefore, how can his condemnation of the most recent video be taken as serious or sincere?
The video also depicts him attacking former president Barack Obama, which alone should attract the attention of the Secret Service. They should investigate the showing of such a video inside Trump's own Florida resort property.
These acts, taken together and combined, also warrant inclusion into a further article of impeachment.

Romney says he's behind 'Delecto' Twitter account

Texto completo: Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, the former Republican presidential candidate and former Massachusetts governor, is also, apparently, the man behind a Twitter account that uses the moniker “Pierre Delecto."
Romney on Sunday admitted to McKay Coppins, a writer at The Atlantic, that he was responsible for the social media account, which he uses to covertly monitor political discourse and occasionally defend himself. It's unclear what, if anything, Pierre Delecto is a reference to.
Several events preceded the admission.
First, The Atlantic published Sunday a profile of Romney, one of the few prominent Republican lawmakers to criticize President Trump over his efforts to press Ukraine to investigate his Democratic rivals. Those efforts form the basis of an impeachment investigation by the House.
Trump lashed out in response this month, calling the senator on Twitter a “pompous 'ass' who has been fighting me from the beginning." In one tweet, the president used the hashtag “#IMPEACHMITTROMNEY."
In the Atlantic profile, Romney admitted to having what he called a “lurker account" — essentially a profile under a different name that he operated in secret to monitor the political conversation.
But he declined to divulge the name associated with the account.
The admission spurred curiosity, particularly that of the online newsmagazine Slate.
Slate theorized that Pierre Delecto, or Twitter user @qaws9876, was Romney after it discovered the account among the Twitter followers of one of his grandchildren.
Slate noted that Pierre Delecto's first follower was Romney's oldest son, Tagg.
The account was created in 2011, shortly after Romney announced his intention to run for president.
The account also posted several telling replies to Romney-related tweets, which were captured by screenshot before the account was made private Sunday night.
In one tweet from May, Jennifer Rubin, a conservative blogger at The Washington Post, said Romney's strategy on Trump was “non-confrontation verging on spinelessness."
“Jennifer, you need to take a breath," Pierre Delecto replied. “Maybe you can then acknowledge the people who agree with you in large measure even if not in every measure."
The Slate article prompted many on social media to surmise that if Pierre Delecto was in fact Romney, he had concocted one of the most prolific social media pseudonyms for a public official ever.
After Slate published its article, Coppins circled back with Romney to ask if he was indeed “Pierre Delecto."
“Just spoke to @MittRomney on the phone, and asked him about Pierre Delecto," Coppins said in a tweet. “His only response: “C'est moi."'
A spokeswoman for Romney did not directly answer questions about the account Sunday night. But in an e-mail, the spokeswoman sent a link to the tweet from Coppins describing Romney's admission.

Facebook says it removed Russian-backed accounts
Facebook on Monday said it removed a network of Russian-backed accounts that posed as locals weighing in on political issues in swing states, praising President Trump and attacking former Vice President Joe Biden.
Facebook said the network bears the hallmark of the same Kremlin-backed group that interfered in the 2016 election by sowing social discord, boosting Trump, and attacking Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
A coordinated group of Russian accounts that appears to show some links to the Internet Research Agency took largely to Facebook's photo-sharing app, Instagram, to post content this year about US politics and memes targeting Democratic presidential contenders.
The Russian network was one of four takedowns Facebook revealed Monday; it also disabled three misleading campaigns originating in Iran.

Warren unveils plan to fund public education revamp
Senator Elizabeth Warren unveiled an $800 billion plan to fund her proposal for reshaping US public education and disclosed that her proposed wealth tax would pay for school and child-care initiatives — in effect transferring the cost of raising a child from birth to college to America's richest families.
Warren would quadruple US federal funding for public schools over 10 years, to $450 billion, and add $200 billion for students with disabilities. The spending includes $100 billion in “Excellence Grants" over a decade — the equivalent of $1 million for every US school — and $50 billion to improve buildings and other infrastructure. “The vastly unequal state of public school facilities is unacceptable and a threat to public education," Warren wrote in a Medium post Monday. “We cannot legitimately call our schools 'public' when some students have state-of-the-art classrooms and others do not even have consistent running water. The federal government must step in."
The campaign estimates the wealth tax would raise about $2.75 trillion over a decade. From that, Warren would cover her $1.07 trillion universal child-care plan, the cancellation of $640 billion of student debt, $610 billion for free-college tuition and now $800 billion for K-12 education.

Trump says Gabbard is not an agent of Russia
President Trump is attacking Hillary Clinton for suggesting Democratic presidential candidate Representative Tulsi Gabbard is a Russian agent.
Trump says of Gabbard, "she's not a Russian agent."
Clinton appeared to call Gabbard "the favorite of the Russians" in a recent interview, saying she believes the Russians have "got their eye on somebody who's currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate." Speaking during a Cabinet meeting Monday, Trump says Clinton and other Democrats claim everyone opposed to them is a Russian agent.Trump says he thinks Clinton's attack boosts Gabbard and his own chances.

Author of anonymous New York Times op-ed to publish tell-all book

Texto completo: The author of an anonymous op-ed published in the New York Times last year, who has only been identified as a senior official in the Trump administration acting as part of the “resistance,” is writing a tell-all book about the Trump presidency.
The book, titled A WARNING, is set to be published on Nov. 19, according to the Washington Post.
“Picking up from where those first words of warning left off, this explosive book offers a shocking, firsthand account of President Trump and his record,” a statement about the book’s release said.
The author, who will remain anonymous in the book, is being represented by Matt Latimer and Keith Urbahn of Javelin, the same literary agents who represented fired FBI Director James Comey and former White House aide Cliff Sims.
The New York Times published the column, titled “I am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration,” in September 2018, setting off intense speculation about its anonymous author, who described administration officials’s efforts to undermine the president. Dozens of top Trump officials denied writing the column.
“The dilemma — which [President Trump] does not fully grasp — is that many of the senior officials in his own administration are working diligently from within to frustrate parts of his agenda and his worst inclinations. I would know. I am one of them,” the writer said.
“It may be cold comfort in this chaotic era, but Americans should know that there are adults in the room. We fully recognize what is happening. And we are trying to do what’s right even when Donald Trump won’t,” the piece continued.
Trump attacked the anonymous author, questioning whether the person had committed treason. He demanded the New York Times reveal the person’s identity “at once.”
Tweet
The author will discuss their reasons for remaining anonymous in the book and has not taken an advance. The author also plans to donate some of the book’s royalties.
"The author of A WARNING refused the chance at a seven-figure advance and intends to donate a substantial amount of any royalties to the White House Correspondents Association and other organizations that fight for a free press that seeks the truth," Latimer told CNN.
The book "was not written by the author lightly, or for the purpose of financial enrichment. It has been written as an act of conscience and of duty,” he said.
The publisher, Twelve, and Javelin have verified the book’s author is the same person who wrote the New York Times column.
Latimer declined to say whether the author still worked in the Trump administration.
Sources familiar with the book said "elaborate precautions have been taken to protect the author's identity."

Trump: White House might 'terminate' New York Times and Washington Post subscriptions

Texto completo: President Trump claimed that the White House is considering ending their subscriptions of the New York Times and the Washington Post.
The president made the quip while discussing former Vice President Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden, in a Monday interview with Sean Hannity.
“They gave Pulitzer Prizes to people that got it wrong, OK?” Trump stated. “All these people doing it for the New York Times, which is a fake newspaper, we don’t even want it in the White House anymore. We’re gonna probably terminate that and the Washington Post. They’re fake.”

“What does it say about the media?” Hannity asked Trump earlier in the interview, adding, “I agree with you.”
“The media’s corrupt,” the president responded. “Not all media is. Look, I know some great people, including you, but I know some great journalists.”
Trump also took a swipe at CNN’s Anderson Cooper for the way he asked Biden about his son during last week’s Democratic primary debate.
“I watched this crazy Anderson Cooper the other day during the debate,” Trump said, “apologize for having to ask the question to them. Apologize.”
He said that if one of his sons was accused of similar actions to Hunter Biden, it "would be the biggest story of this century."

Texto completo: Maricela, una inmigrante salvadoreña que no quiere dar su apellido por temor, llevaba más de una década inscribiendo a sus hijos, nacidos en Estados Unidos, en el programa de seguro médico gratuito Medicaid . Este año decidió no hacerlo.
“Mi peor miedo es terminar perdiendo mi estatus legal y ser separada de mis hijos”, le relató esta madre soltera de Houston (Texas) al diario The New York Times.
El gobierno que preside Donald Trump ha aprobado una regla para negar el visado o la residencia permanente a los migrantes que puedan requerir ayudas sociales . Un tribunal federal ha bloqueado temporalmente la medida, que no afecta además al seguro médico de los menores de 21 años .
[INFÓRMESE: Éstas son las 8 ayudas públicas que pueden cancelar su visado o green card]
El hijo mayor de Maricela tiene 11 años y sufre asma. Sin seguro, su tratamiento cuesta 150 dólares al mes. Tras escucharle toser por la noche, decidió al fin apuntar a los dos niños a Medicaid. Pero Maricela tiene miedo: “Sería mortal para mí”, asegura sobre su posible deportación, “tuve que hacerlo, pero tengo miedo”.
No es la única: más de un millón de niños en todo el país –el 3% de todos los inscritos– han desaparecido de la lista de los dos principales programas de salud estatales y federales para familias de bajos ingresos, Medicaid y el Programa de Seguro de Salud para Niños (CHIP), entre diciembre de 2017 y junio de 2019.
Un análisis del censo realizado por The New York Times muestra que el número de niños sin ningún tipo de seguro aumentó bajo el gobierno de Trump en más de 400,000 entre 2016 y 2018 .
Funcionarios estatales y federales han justificado sin embargo este descenso por la mejora de la economía, que ha permitido, han dicho, que muchas familias obtengan empleos con un seguro privado.“El desempleo sigue siendo bajo, el crecimiento salarial ha aumentado, y ahora vemos que menos personas dependen de la asistencia pública”, dijo en abril Seema Verma, administradora de los Centros de Servicios de Medicare y Medicaid. “Eso es algo para celebrar”, añadió.
Pero de acuerdo con el análisis periodístico, los cambios administrativos destinados supuestamente a combatir el fraude y el despilfarro de recursos, y los crecientes temores por las medidas migratorias de Trump , han jugado un papel en el descenso de los niños inscritos en los programas federales de seguro médico.
Los descensos se concentran en una minoría de estados; en otros, la cobertura pública ha aumentado. Texas, donde el 40% de la población es latina, lidera el número de niños y adultos sin seguro médico .
Kelli Weldon, portavoz de la Comisión de Salud de ese estado, lo ha achacado a los “niveles récord de bajo desempleo”.
Algunos de los estados que registraron los mayores aumentos en niños sin seguro, como Tennessee y Texas, fueron los que crearon reglas para verificar la elegibilidad de las familias con mayor frecuencia, o actualizaron sus listas de beneficiarios con nuevos sistemas informáticos.
+ inscribe ahora a los niños durante seis meses y luego revisa las bases de datos durante cuatro meses consecutivos para garantizar que el ingreso familiar aún sea lo suficientemente bajo como para calificar para el programa. Si las bases de datos muestran que el ingreso ha superado el límite, se notifica a las familias por correo y tienen 10 días para demostrar lo contrario o perder el seguro.
El número de niños sin seguro en ese estado aumentó en alrededor de 120,000 entre 2016 y 2018. Los funcionarios estatales aumentaron además los requisitos de papeleo en 2014 para las familias cubiertas por Medicaid y CHIP , que atiende a niños cuyos ingresos son ligeramente más altos que los de Medicaid.
Otros estados también han comenzado a controlar los ingresos familiares con más frecuencia, o eliminar familias que podrían haberse mudado si el correo es devuelto.
Cuando Tennessee actualizó su sistema informático de inscripción en 2016, generó miles de errores. La inscripción de Medicaid y CHIP en ese estado ha disminuido en más de 55,000 niños desde enero de 2018, según el Centro de Niños y Familias de Georgetown.
El director de Medicaid de Tennessee, Gabe Roberts, dijo que, además de la mejora de la economía, l a disminución de la inscripción fue el resultado de actualizar el sistema informático y eliminar una acumulación de casos antiguos .
Sin embargo, en ese estado los mayores descensos en la inscripción de Medicaid se produjeron en los condados con las tasas de desempleo más altas, según un análisis del Centro de Justicia.
En 2010, la Ley del Cuidado de Salud Asequible, conocida como Obamacare, facilitó que los estados verificaran si las familias calificaban para Medicaid sin requerir que completaran la documentación , una estrategia probada para aumentar las tasas de cobertura. Además, Obamacare dificultó que los estados expulsaran a las familias pobres por errores de papeleo.
Para el año próximo, habrá 20 aseguradoras más vendiendo planes de Obamacare en el mercado federal, que es utilizado por personas en 38 estados, para un total de 175, informó The New York Times.
El término Obamacare generalmente se usa para describir un seguro médico privado adquirido a través de los intercambios de seguro médico; los planes son ofrecidos por compañías privadas de seguros de salud; Medicaid es un plan federal gratuito pero los requisitos para que se otorgue tienen que ver con el nivel de pobreza definido en cada estado y son estrictos.

Texto completo: El alto funcionario anónimo del gobierno del presidente Donald Trump –que publicó un artículo en The New York Times— tiene una nueva sorpresa para el mandatario. Mejor dicho, le tiene Una advertencia, como se titula el libro que publicará en noviembre.
El misterioso personaje se volvió famoso tras publicar aquella editorial donde habla sobre el movimiento dentro de la Casa Blanca que busca asegurar el éxito del Gobierno estadounidense.
“Para ser claros, la nuestra no es la ‘resistencia’ popular de la izquierda” , dice aquella pieza publicada en septiembre de 2018 . “Queremos que la administración tenga éxito y creemos que muchas de sus políticas ya han hecho que Estados Unidos sea más seguro y más próspero” .
CNN obtuvo la portada del libro, el cual había sido un secreto, pero será lanzado el 19 de noviembre.
“Se han tomado fuertes precauciones para proteger la identidad del autor” , dijeron fuentes a la televisora.
Un borrador de un comunicado de prensa de la editorial Twelve describe el libro como como impactante.
“Retomando de donde se quedaron esas primeras palabras de advertencia, este libro explosivo ofrece una impactante historia de primera mano del presidente Trump” , indica.
Los editores afirman que el autor no publica el libro por dinero y que incluso analiza la intención de donar gran parte de las ganancia a la Asociación de Corresponsales de la Casa Blanca y otras organizaciones que luchan por la libertad de prensa.
También se desconoce si el autor continúa en la Administración Trump, además de que la Casa Blanca declinó hacer comentarios.

Kevin Love Traveled All Summer. There Were No Refs in Sight.

Texto completo: After an off-season in which it seemed like the N.B.A. never took a break, The New York Times talked to a few of the league's stars about some of the other important things in their lives -- anything but basketball.
Part II: Cleveland Cavaliers forward Kevin Love is entering his 12th season as a former champion on a team looking to redefine itself. Part I: Miami's Jimmy Butler describes his bromance with the soccer star Neymar.
Kevin Love swears he was a cowboy in a previous life.
During a summer that turned his Instagram feed into a traveler's dream, Love said his favorite place to photograph was Jackson Hole, Wyo., where he was teleported to the era of his favorite genre of film: spaghetti westerns. He did his best to show off ensembles that made him look like an extra on "The Good, The Bad, The Ugly."
"The colors, the aesthetics and the feel of it," Love said of Jackson Hole, "it still has the essence of the Wild West."
After four consecutive N.B.A. finals appearances, Love and the Cleveland Cavaliers -- without the departed LeBron James -- finished last season with a 19-63 record. For the first time in half a decade, Love got to enjoy an extended off-season in the N.B.A. The extra time off presented an opportunity to catch up on a growing travel to-do list.
When the celebrity chef and travel documentarian Anthony Bourdain died by suicide in June of last year, Love was competing in the N.B.A. finals. The two had never crossed paths, but Love had Bourdain on a short list of people he had wanted to meet.
Love said he had always admired Bourdain's open-mindedness as he explored the world on TV programs such as "No Reservations" and "Parts Unknown."
"The great thing I learned from him was to be relentlessly curious and without fear of prejudice," Love said. Having taken a recent interest in photography which resulted in his buying a new camera and two new lenses, Love set out to capture the photogenic essence of each location he visited this summer.
While there were clear benefits to having and sharing beautiful photos with his 3.1 million Instagram followers, Love also had a simpler reason for curating his experience this summer.
"I think people have to walk that fine line of living in the moment and also capturing the moment as well," Love said. "That's what I hoped to gain out of it. Just documenting the happy times."
His travels with his girlfriend, Kate Bock, started in Phuket, Thailand, and ended in Jackson Hole, Wyo. In between, the 31-year-old Cavaliers forward took a trip back home to Portland, Ore., brought his dog, Vestry, along with him to explore the Cascade Mountains in British Columbia, and made a brief stop at Antelope Canyon in Arizona.
When Love and Bock arrived in Phuket, they sought out locals for recommendations.
"It was an endless summer where we chased experiences," Love said.

In Thailand, the two visited the Elephant Sanctuary, the Big Buddha, and also came across a new-to-them culinary world at the Sunday street market. A coconut sorbet sourced from a local town was a highlight.
"Some people eat to live," Love said. "Some people live to eat. I live to eat."
As the photos of his journey overtook his social media feeds, Love started getting travel tips. While visiting British Columbia, Love received a direct message from someone there offering him a helicopter trip. Love was able to visit glaciers and hot springs that few tourists get to explore.
Some might point to his social media presence this summer and say it was less about being an open-minded traveler than living the life of a celebrity, but for Love, his destinations held personal meaning, like his connection to the Wild West in Jackson Hole, or spending a majority of time outdoors in British Columbia, which reminded him of his sense of adventure growing up in Portland.
"We always saw rain," Love said. "When you have that type of climate, especially when the summer comes around, we were always outside."
Love also traveled to Aspen, Colo., to join San Antonio Spurs guard DeMar DeRozan and the performance psychologist Michael Gervais at the Aspen Ideas Festival for a panel discussion on mental health.
Last year, in an essay for The Players' Tribune, Love described a panic attack he had shortly after halftime of a game against the Atlanta Hawks. He spoke in detail about his mental health issues, joining DeRozan as the two most outspoken N.B.A. players on the topic.
"It's been healing for a lot of people," Love said. "But it's been healing for me as well. It's been liberating. It's made me feel more evolved. I just feel more comfortable in my own skin. I don't have to be anybody else but myself. By doing this, I've laid all my cards out there."
From his own experience and hearing from others, Love has made finding a balance in his day-to-day life a priority.
"I've continued to try to be a voice in this and to listen to other people's stories and learn," Love said. "Because the numbers say we're trending in the wrong direction. There's still so much ambiguity in what people are dealing with. There's so many layers to treatment for mental illness. I just want to continue to keep learning and inspiring people to live healthy lives."
That is why he took the time to get away over the past few months and take his mind off basketball.
"Having the summer to get away from it," Love said, "I know I'm better off having done so."
Still, Love acknowledged that finding the balance doesn't mean altogether shutting off being a professional athlete, even if he wants to. In Thailand and other places, Love was keenly aware of managing his body, which meant 90-minute workouts every morning and a swim in the evening.
"I know that being able to help people out with mental health, being able to afford to travel, none of it happens without basketball," he said.
Love will begin his 12th season in the N.B.A. this week, but he has already started researching with Bock their next adventure. At the top of the list: Africa for a safari.
Asked to provide a tip for curious travelers, Love suggested they get off the beaten path, let go of the script and allow themselves to discover something entirely new, about the place they're in and about themselves.
"Life isn't meant to be lived in black and white," Love said. "It's meant to be lived in beautiful colors."

Texto completo: Dos senadores republicanos han expresado en los últimos días que se plantean apoyar el proceso que echaría al presidente Donald Trump de la Casa Blanca , en caso de que la Cámara de Representantes vote primero a favor. Esto hace que el llamado “muro rojo” de apoyo al mandatario se empiece a resquebrajar en el Congreso, a posar del sólido respaldo de las bases del partido.
Además, dentro del partido republicano también han surgido fuertes oposiciones a acciones polémicas del presidente como la retirada de las tropas estadounidenses del norte de Siria o intención (luego cancelada) de celebrar la Cumbre del G-7 en una de sus propiedades. Hasta ahora han sido dos los funcionarios republicanos que han alzado públicamente la voz contra el presidente.
Uno de ellos es el senador Lindsey Graham, de Carolina del Sur , que este lunes en una entrevista en Axios TV expresó una raro enojo por el comportamiento del presidente. Graham, uno de los más acérrimos aliados del presidente, aseguró que respaldaría el impeachment si se demuestra que el presidente se saltó la ley.
Por su parte, Mitt Rommey, senador por Utah , fue más allá en la entrevista con el medio ya que incluso enumeró los motivos para destituir al presidente de su cargo. Rommey sí que está entre los republicanos más críticos del presidente. De hecho, fuentes cercanas al senador dijeron a Axios TV que sería de los primeros en votar para condenar a Trump.
Trump sabe que el apoyo de un republicano moderado como Rommey a una hipotética destitución podría alentar a otros colegas de ideas afines a seguir sus pasos. El Washington Post y The New York Times coinciden en que esta teoría parece haber asustado al presidente, que el pasado fin de semana dio marcha atrás en su intención de celebrar la cumbre del G-7 en su resort de Florida .
Para que el impechament salga adelante en el Senado, tras su aprobación en la Cámara Baja. 20 republicanos deben unirse a los 45 demócratas del Senado y a dos independientes para conseguir al menos los 67 votos que echarían a Trump de la Casa Blanca. Hasta ahora, Axios solo ha identificado a ocho republicanos de la Cámara Alta que podrían votar en contra del mandatario.

All Hillary's Russian Assets; Her refusal to own up to a bad campaign gives Tulsi Gabbard a moment in the sun.

Texto completo: Ever since Hillary Clinton suggested Rep. Tulsi Gabbard is a Russian "asset," the Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii has been on the attack. But she ought to consider the remarks an in-kind contribution. Because before Mrs. Clinton's ham-handed insertion of herself into the 2020 Democratic race, Ms. Gabbard's campaign for president was going nowhere.
The big challenge before Ms. Gabbard now is whether she will make it into the next Democratic debate on Nov. 20 in Atlanta. She has yet to meet the polling requirements: either 3% support in four Democratic National Committee approved national polls, or 5% in two DNC-approved polls from states with early primaries (Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada).
Ms. Gabbard has had trouble cracking 2% in most polls, and her debate performance last Tuesday hasn't moved the needle. A FiveThirtyEight.com analysis put her at the bottom of the pack of all the Democratic candidates who made it to the stage, and noted her postdebate net favorability had dropped further into negative numbers.
Nor is her alleged stooging for Moscow Democrats' only issue with Ms. Gabbard. In her call to bring the troops home, many hear echoes of Donald Trump; her support for a ban on third-trimester abortions breaks with the party's abortion absolutism; notwithstanding an apology, her past opposition to same-sex marriage has led to charges of homophobia; and her threat to boycott last week's debate after alleging its corporate sponsors (CNN and the New York Times) worked with Democratic Party officials to "rig" the election had the Times writing how her political contribution was "injecting a bit of chaos" into the race.
Enter Mrs. Clinton. Speaking Thursday with former Obama campaign manager David Plouffe for his "Campaign HQ" podcast, Mrs. Clinton offered that Ms. Gabbard is a tool of Moscow. Though she didn't mention her by name, the reference was unmistakable:
"I'm not making any predictions, but I think they've got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate," Mrs. Clinton said. "She's a favorite of the Russians. They have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far."
Mrs. Clinton went on to say that Jill Stein, who ran in 2016 on the Green Party ticket, is "also a Russian asset." She later said she meant the Republicans were grooming the third-party candidate, but the use of the word "also" to describe Ms. Stein as a Russian asset shows that isn't true.
Call it Hillary Classic. Start with an outrageous charge, backed with zero evidence, against a combat veteran who still serves as a major in the Army National Guard. Use an interview about the 2020 election to try to settle an old score, in this case Ms. Gabbard's 2016 resignation as vice chairman of the DNC and her endorsement of Bernie Sanders after she'd complained publicly the party was limiting debates, which was thought to favor Mrs. Clinton. Finally, yet again blame your loss to Mr. Trump on the Russians rather than accept that you were a lousy candidate.
Ms. Gabbard minced no words in response. She launched a tweetstorm that began, "Thank you @HillaryClinton. You, the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long, have finally come out from behind the curtain."
On Sunday she escalated. In a video she accused Mrs. Clinton of a "new McCarthyism" and asked for help in taking back the party from Mrs. Clinton and "her rich and powerful friends." "If they can falsely portray me as a traitor," Ms. Gabbard warned, "then they can do it to anyone."
It's making for interesting bedfellows. Most Democratic defenses of Ms. Gabbard have come from the minor candidates, such as Beto O'Rourke and Marianne Williamson. They are also coming from Republicans. At his cabinet meeting Monday, President Trump declared that Mrs. Clinton believes "anybody that is opposed to her is a Russian agent."
Some anti-Trumpers are coming to her side as well. Rep. Justin Amash, the Michigan congressman who recently left the GOP, tweeted that whatever else may be unclear, "the thing we know for sure is that Hillary Clinton is a Donald Trump asset." Meanwhile the Associated Press ran a story Monday with the headline, "Tulsi Gabbard elevated in Iowa by Clinton spat."
This week will probably tell whether Ms. Gabbard's nuclear response to Mrs. Clinton will give her the boost in polling she needs to get herself into the next Democratic debate, or whether their dispute will merely give conservative radio something to chew on for the next few days. But if the controversy does elevate her to the next debate, it won't be just Tulsi Gabbard on that stage in Atlanta. With her will come a question on which almost all her fellow candidates would rather pass: About the high price the party continues to pay for Hillary Clinton and her fantasy that all her electoral troubles came from Russian agents.

Three ways to save big money on Halloween

Texto completo: 'Tis the season for fake spiders, light-up ghosts, tiny candy bars, and tacky costumes. All that Halloween stuff can make your bank account balance look downright scary! So, let's talk about three simple tips for saving money on Halloween.
1. Don't buy name-brand candy
There was a time in my life when I was overly concerned with being the "cool" house on the block. You know, the one with the really legit, exciting candy at Halloween — maybe even some full-size candy bars.
But when I saw the price tag at the store, that need to impress the neighbors left quick. I thought, Nope! Sorry, cute neighbor kids. You're getting the generic brand. I can buy a huge bag of it for half the price!
If you're on a tight budget, don't feel pressured to splurge and get the expensive candy. The kids will get plenty, and they'll all be on sugar highs anyway, so they'll never know the difference.
2. Scale back on Halloween parties
Halloween parties are pretty elaborate these days with huge spreads of food, amazing costumes, and even signature cocktails. If you're hosting or attending one, just be wise with what you spend. After all, Halloween is just one day!
If you're hosting, ask your guests to bring a dish to share. Set a budget for yourself on party supplies and decorations, and stick to it!
If you're attending someone else's party, don't feel pressured to bring the fanciest bottle of wine or go overboard with buying the most impressive costume. You don't want to go into November stressed out about overspending on this one day.
3. You can decide not to celebrate Halloween
Okay, I honestly don't love Halloween. Not for any spiritual or moral reason, it's simply because I'm not creative. And I'm terrible at coming up with costumes! Thankfully, my girls usually want to be princesses. That's something Amazon can fix. But I dread the day when they want something more imaginative. I'm not the mom who just whips up a costume out of odds and ends in my craft closet.
But guess what? No one says we must celebrate Halloween. There's no shame or guilt in a graceful no if Halloween doesn't fit your budget this year. If you sit this holiday out, you'll save so much money on candy, costumes, and ugly plastic partywear. Plus, you'll save time and energy. You can always jump back in next year, when you have room in your budget.

Questions abound on tax breaks

Texto completo: New Jersey continues to probe potential conflicts of interest in the state's corporate tax break programs, and whether or not businesses misrepresented information in order to win millions of dollars from two recently expired programs now being investigated by federal and state authorities.
Audits and reports found that the state agency doling out billions of dollars in tax breaks to companies didn't have the processes in place to adequately vet applications and spot red flags, and raise questions about information companies certified as true in their applications and whether lobbyists registered with the state when required.
The agency granting the lucrative tax breaks, the Economic Development Authority, relies on fees from the applications to help boost the government body's budget, which is self-funded and doesn't rely on state appropriations. The fees get larger if an application is approved, which creates an unhealthy incentive and potential conflict of interest, according to lawyers on a task force created by Gov. Phil Murphy.
"Part of that funding stream is the approval of applications that require diligence and require a gatekeeper," said task force special counsel Jim Walden at a hearing Thursday.
In 2017, the EDA brought in almost a third of its revenue from Grow NJ program fees, or $13.2 million. In previous years, the agency collected an average of 15% of its revenue from the program's fees.
If an application is approved, a company must pay 0.5% of the award up to $500,000, and again for when the tax break is actually issued. Companies then pay a service fee up to 2% of the tax credit up to $75,000. A company pays up to $5,000 to apply for a tax break.
Walden noted that the EDA underwriters he interviewed all said the fees did not cause them to approve an application, and they do not receive any bonuses for approvals.
The Philadelphia 76ers basketball team, which won a close to $80 million tax break to build a new practice facility in Camden, is the only company that included the fees it paid in its calculation that determined the size of its tax break.
"What happened is that the public paid for the EDA's fees," Walden said. "That money is money that the public was deprived of."
False statements Refrigeration distribution company Rainforest Distribution, which won a $2.4 million tax break in 2016, appeared to misrepresent information on its application to the Economic Development Authority, according to evidence presented Thursday at a hearing led by the task force.
The Queens-based company certified to the Economic Development Authority that it was considering moving to either Bayonne or Orangeburg, New York. In order to win a New Jersey tax break, a company has to prove it wouldn't move to New Jersey if it didn't have the tax break.
Emails between Rainforest Distribution employees and a consulting firm it hired, CBRE, suggest that Rainforest did not seriously plan on locating in Orangeburg.
Rainforest CEO Alexander Ridings, who was the CFO at the time the company submitted its application, admitted during Thursday's hearing the company had no serious intention of moving to Orangeburg. He said a commercial real estate firm the company hired, CBRE, asked for detailed information and reasons about why the New York site would also fit the company's needs.
Emails between CBRE and Rainforest employees show a CBRE employee named Susan Harte asking for a "lower cost option than NJ" and advised the company not to submit the draft lease Rainforest had from the Bayonne location. The company did not have a draft lease from Orangeburg. Harte asked Rainforest to submit a different document to the EDA "as it shows we are not so far along."
Ridings said he did not understand how this information would be used in Rainforest's application, and that it was the first time he was dealing with a commercial real estate firm and applying for a tax incentive. Special counsel Walden noted that Rainforest would have probably still been eligible for the tax break even if it just listed its previous location in Queens on its application.
"Effective October 16, 2019, Susan Harte, who previously served in our Location Incentives Group, is no longer employed by CBRE," CBRE said in a statement. "CBRE takes great pride in its reputation for upholding the highest ethical standards, which we demand from each of our 90,000 professionals around the globe."
Task force lawyers also read emails between Harte and EDA employees, and asked if the messages should be considered lobbying. Stephanie Olivo, the director of compliance with the state campaign finance agency, said yes. Harte does not appear to have registered with the agency.
"If special interests are not disclosed, there's the possibility the special interests are using illegal means to get their way," Walden said. Registering means "at least there's a breadcrumb trail."
The New York Times found that over five years, a dozen companies listed the same New York address at Blue Hill Plaza as the location they were considering moving to if they didn't win a New Jersey tax break.
The FBI and Philadelphia prosecutors are among a handful of entities investigating the two corporate tax break programs meant to boost job growth and development, Grow NJ and Economic Redevelopment & Growth (ERG), according to the Philadelphia Inquirer.
A Senate panel is also considering replacement programs for Grow NJ and ERG, which expired earlier this year. An ethics committee dismissed a complaint filed by advocacy group Working Families earlier this week that alleged the committee was stacked with members with connections to insurance executive and power broker, George Norcross.
Norcross is tied to companies that won $1.1 billion of the $1.6 billion worth of tax breaks awarded in Camden, according to a ProPublica and WNYC investigation. The news outlets also found that lawyers from Parker McCay had an outsized role in the crafting of the Economic Opportunity Act, which created the revamped tax break programs. Parker McCay is led by Norcross' brother, Philip Norcross, and also represents many of the companies that won tax breaks.

Nick Tosches, Fiery Writer Of Music's 'Unsung Heroes' And Biographer, Dies at 69

Texto completo: He brought a brash style to coverage of the rock world in the late 1960s and '70s, then applied similar skills to novels and books on Dean Martin and Sonny Liston.
Nick Tosches, who started out in the late 1960s as a brash music writer with a taste for the fringes of rock and country, then bent his eclectic style to biographies of figures like Dean Martin and Sonny Liston and to hard-to-classify novels, died on Sunday at his home in Manhattan. He was 69.
The exact cause has not been determined, but he had been ill, a friend, James Marshall, said.
Mr. Tosches (TOSH-ez) and his fellow music writers Richard Meltzer and Lester Bangs were labeled "the Noise Boys" for their wild, energetic prose, a world away from fan magazines like Tiger Beat. Interviewing Debbie Harry of the band Blondie in 1979 for Creem magazine, he thought nothing of asking whether she shaved or waxed her legs. Neither, it turned out; she told him she plucked them, one hair at a time.
"We speak for many minutes of legs and their lore," he wrote. "Each of us learns a great deal from the other. A mutual respect is born."
In 1977 Mr. Tosches published his first book, "Country," a well-researched look at some of country music's lesser-known and often roguish figures. "Unsung Heroes of Rock 'n' Roll" followed in 1984, with chapters on Ella Mae Morse, Skeets McDonald and many more.
But by then Mr. Tosches had already begun to branch out. His first biography, "Hellfire: The Jerry Lee Lewis Story," came out in 1982, and in 1986 he ventured beyond music with "Power on Earth: Michele Sindona's Explosive Story," about an Italian financier who was involved in assorted scandals.
One of his most attention-getting biographies followed in 1992. It was "Dino: Living High in the Dirty Business of Dreams," about Dean Martin.
"Recordings, movies, radio, television: He would cast his presence over them all, a mob-culture Renaissance man," he wrote of Martin. "And he would come to know, as few ever would, how dirty the business of dreams could be."
For Mr. Tosches, Martin was a celebrity who beat the unrelenting fame machine, the one that often ground stars up and consigned them to early deaths. (Martin himself died in 1995 at 78.)
"I would describe Dean as a noble character in an ignoble racket in an ignoble age," Mr. Tosches told The New York Times in 1992.
"Life is a racket," he added. "Writing is a racket. Sincerity is a racket. Everything's a racket."
Mr. Tosches was born on Oct. 23, 1949, in Newark, to Nick and Muriel Ann (Wynn) Tosches.
"The things I wanted to be when I was a kid were an archaeologist, because of dinosaur bones; a garbage man, because they got to ride on the side of the trucks; and a writer," he told The Times. "If I had become a garbage man, I could have retired by now."
Mr. Tosches' father owned a bar, and working there as a boy, as he often said later, provided him with the type of street-smart education that mattered. College was never a consideration; instead he held what he described to The Boston Globe in 2000 as "a bunch of strange jobs, both legitimate and illegitimate."
He liked to tell of the few weeks he spent as a snake hunter for the Miami Serpentarium, which collected venom for research, even though he was afraid of snakes.
"You'd smoke out rattlesnakes by pouring gasoline down their holes and the fumes would drive them out," he told Salon in 1999. "I did not make it too far in that job. Part of the con was anyone who brought in a rattlesnake over six feet would get a thousand bucks, and the thing is, there's never been a rattlesnake over six feet. It's a myth." (Some experts, however, contend that six-foot rattlesnakes, though rare, do exist.)
At 19 he was living in New York and, as he often related, working for an underwear company on Madison Avenue.
"I was doing back then, in the days before computers, what they called paste-ups and mechanicals," he told Vanity Fair in 2011. "You have a glue pot, a T-square, a razor blade, and you physically put together advertisements."
Ed Sanders, who was a member of the underground rock band the Fugs and operated the Peace Eye Bookstore in the East Village in Manhattan, a counterculture hangout, befriended Mr. Tosches and gave him encouraging words about some poetry he had written, nudging along his budding interest in becoming a writer. In 1969 he sold his first article, to Fusion, a Boston magazine.
Through the 1970s and into the '80s he wrote for that magazine as well as for Rolling Stone, Creem and other publications, practicing a free-ranging brand of journalism that fell under the label "gonzo." Although his music-related books were obsessively researched, he didn't always take his magazine writing so seriously, especially early on, when he was known to do things like review nonexistent albums.
"I was just using it as a rubric to get away with things in print, things that probably would be impossible to get away with now," he told The Times. "Like making records up, which I've done. Reviewing records without even opening the shrink wrap."
In 1988 Mr. Tosches published his first novel, "Cut Numbers," about a small-time loan shark. Another, "Trinities," about the international heroin trade, appeared in 1994.
In 1996 Mr. Tosches became a contributing editor to Vanity Fair, and an article he wrote for the magazine on the boxer Sonny Liston became the 2000 biography "The Devil and Sonny Liston." That same year, he published "The Nick Tosches Reader," a collection drawn from his three decades' worth of work.
His most acclaimed and most audacious work of fiction, "In the Hand of Dante," was published in 2002. The story centered on a previously unknown manuscript of Dante's masterwork, "The Divine Comedy," and a more or less fictional character named Nick Tosches who is called upon to authenticate it.
"'In the Hand of Dante' weaves together the life of Dante with the life of a character named Nick Tosches,"' Will Blythe wrote in a review in The Times. "Fortunately, it's not quite as postmodern as it sounds. In fact, it's kind of a mess, but a splendid, passionate mess, with a moral fervor far exceeding most novels of better grooming."
In his review in The Edmonton Journal of Alberta, Dennis Chute delivered a considerably more backhanded compliment.
"I think Tosches is a puffed-up buffoon whose bio is a pile of horse manure," he wrote. "Let me tell you that he also has a prose style made up of pretty phrases that mean nothing, a fixation with the word dark, and a love for obscure words he doesn't understand how to use. So why do I think this is a must-read book? Because Tosches is one of the few writers you can experience on a visceral level. Reading Tosches is like being mugged."
"Me and the Devil" (2012) also featured a character named Nick who bore similarities to the author, though one hopes not too many. This Nick enjoyed vampiric sex with young women. The book was not well received. In The Denver Post, John Broening called it "a series of self-aggrandizing pornographic daydreams intended to prop up the sagging legend of its author as an icon of below-14th Street duende."
If his writing fell somewhat out of fashion, in late midlife Mr. Tosches cut a distinctive figure in that below-14th Street world, his natty dress inevitably commented upon by interviewers. One focused on his leopard-skin loafers, another on his silk homburg.
"I always felt that that was one of the rewards of being 50," he said. "You could wear a homburg."
An early marriage, in 1972, was brief. Complete information on survivors was not immediately available.
In 2006 the British publication Observer Music Monthly named the 50 greatest music books ever written. Mr. Tosches' Jerry Lee Lewis biography, "Hellfire," was No. 1. He sat for a question-and-answer session in conjunction with the honor.
"At the end of the book, you leave him very much alive, still roaming the earth, but pretty much facing the abyss," the interviewer said of "Hellfire."
"It's the way we all live," Mr. Tosches replied. "Shallow life, shallow ditch. Big life, big abyss."

Texto completo: In an unusual statement, a spokesman said department officials would not have met with President Trump's personal lawyer had they known his associates were under investigation.
The Justice Department distanced itself on Sunday from Rudolph W. Giuliani, President Trump's personal lawyer, declaring that department officials would not have met with Mr. Giuliani to discuss one of his clients had they known that federal prosecutors in New York were investigating two of his associates.
Several weeks ago, Brian A. Benczkowski, the head of the Justice Department's Criminal Division, and lawyers from the division's Fraud Section met with Mr. Giuliani to discuss a bribery case in which he and other attorneys were representing the defendants.
That meeting took place before the United States attorney's office in Manhattan publicly charged the two Giuliani associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, with breaking campaign finance laws and trying to unlawfully influence politicians, including former Representative Pete Sessions, Republican of Texas. Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman were part of Mr. Giuliani's effort to push Ukraine for an inquiry into Democrats.
"When Mr. Benczkowski and fraud section lawyers met with Mr. Giuliani, they were not aware of any investigation of Mr. Giuliani's associates in the Southern District of New York and would not have met with him had they known," said Peter Carr, a department spokesman.
The Justice Department's public statement on Sunday illustrates the unusual and broad set of roles that the president's personal lawyer has played in the scandal that has engulfed the White House and imperiled Mr. Trump's presidency.
Even as Mr. Giuliani ran a shadow foreign policy campaign to pressure Ukraine to investigate the president's political enemies -- which is now at the heart of an impeachment inquiry against Mr. Trump -- he and his business associates were under criminal investigation for unlawfully wielding political influence. And while all of this was happening, Mr. Giuliani still served as a lawyer to clients with cases to plead before the Justice Department.
In distancing itself from Mr. Giuliani and trying to draw bright lines around how the Justice Department will and will not engage with him, the department has also undercut the perception that Mr. Giuliani can influence some of Washington's most important lawyers and decision makers. That could make it harder for Mr. Giuliani to represent clients who are under Justice Department scrutiny in the future.
"This is an incredibly unusual statement from the Justice Department, which does not comment on ongoing investigations or even acknowledge them, and it's the kind of statement that would give clients pause about who is representing them," said Joyce Vance, a former federal prosecutor.
Mr. Giuliani did not respond to a request for comment.
While the Southern District of New York has been investigating Mr. Giuliani's associates -- an inquiry that may be tied to a broader investigation of Mr. Giuliani himself -- prosecutors there had not told Mr. Benczkowski of the Criminal Division of the case, as he does not oversee or supervise their work. The United States attorney's offices report to the deputy attorney general, Jeffrey A. Rosen.
Prosecutors in Manhattan informed Attorney General William P. Barr about the investigation of Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman soon after he was confirmed in February, according to a Justice Department official. They were required to do so under the department's rule that requires prosecutors to notify the attorney general of any cases that could generate national news media or congressional attention.
When Mr. Giuliani and other lawyers requested the meeting with the Justice Department to discuss a foreign bribery case, Mr. Benczkowski and the lawyers in the Fraud Section had not been informed of the Manhattan case and agreed to meet.
Last week, Mr. Giuliani told The New York Times that he was being unfairly attacked by reporters and lawmakers and that questions about his behavior would "destroy" his business.
"I can't publicly defend everything I do because I'm presumed guilty," Mr. Giuliani said in a text message. "If I did, my business and firm would be unable to have any clients."
Foreign business leaders and politicians have long hired those with ties to the White House as consultants, paid back channels to the administration who could plead their cases and present their interests to American decision makers.
Mr. Trump, however, was not connected to the usual array of Washington power brokers who had built lucrative businesses off their ties to American leaders, and Mr. Giuliani was perceived as the rare figure who could provide a direct line to the president.
Now that tie to the Justice Department seems to be gone, and Mr. Giuliani himself is a person of interest in at least two federal investigations.
While The Times and other publications have reported that Mr. Giuliani is being investigated by prosecutors in Manhattan, the Justice Department and the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York have declined to confirm or deny an investigation into him. But any such inquiry would make it difficult for the department to work with him on any of his clients' cases.
"Giuliani can continue to represent clients before the department because people are innocent until proven guilty, but it's unclear whether a client would want to have a lawyer who is being scrutinized in so many investigations," Ms. Vance said.

Sheriff: Courthouse ready for Capital Gazette trial Anne Arundel prepares for more visitors, media with increased security

Texto completo: Visitors walk past the wrought iron gate to enter the Anne Arundel County courthouse, under the brick archway and through the white-washed double doors at the building in downtown Annapolis.
Inside they are met by three deputy sheriffs who push their wallet, keys and phone through an x-ray machine as they walk through a metal detector. If the detector beeps, a deputy used a wand to find whatever set it off - usually something like spare change.
On their walk through the building, they might be met by a police K-9 team. They will pass security cameras that dot the inside and outside of the building.
That's a normal day.
But starting Oct. 30 with jury selection, it will be anything but normal. The massive courthouse, parts of which date to the early 1800s, will be the site of a trial in the deadliest attack on journalism in the history of the United States.
Law enforcement officials say they're ready for a three-week trial expected to draw national attention, taking the same steps they would for any high profile case.
"There are plenty of cases where, through intelligence-sharing, we believe there might be some bad actors who might be wanting to come to court," said county Sheriff Jim Fredericks, whose agency oversees courthouse security. "So, the preparation levels won't be different. It just has to be tailored specifically to the type of case you're dealing with."
Another pre-trial motions hearing is set for Monday in the trial of the man charged with the murder of Gerald Fischman, Rob Hiaasen, John McNamara, Rebecca Smith and Wendi Winters. Jury selection, which will draw from a pool of 300 people, is expected to the following week. The trial itself is scheduled to start Nov. 4.
Deputies will be stationed at entrances to handle members of the media members, family members of the victims, survivors of the attack and others expected to fill the courthouse for one of the most high-profile trials in county history. Jarrod Ramos, 39, case faces five counts of first-degree murder, one count of attempted murder, six counts of first-degree assault, among a host of other charges.
The court will handle the high volume of visitors by deploying additional deputies and opening multiple security lanes at court entrances to improve efficiency, Fredericks said.
"Us being able to do our job a little more efficiently there is going to make it a little bit safer place," he said.
The court does have policies and procedures in place for high-profile trials but the logistics specific to the Capital Gazette trial are still being finalized, Maryland Judiciary spokeswoman Nadine Maeser wrote in an email.
Courtroom 4C, where Circuit Court Judge Laura Ripken will preside over the trial, has a maximum capacity of 200. News media organizations have asked for an overflow room.
Maintaining order in the courtroom are essential to ensuring the trial proceeds like any other, said Ron Bateman, who served three terms as sheriff until December 2018.
Other high profile cases have included the 2012 trial of former county executive John Leopold on abuse of power charges, the 2014 trial of a New Jersey police officer charged with homicide in a road rage incident and the 1984 trial of Larry Schartz, who was convicted of killing his parents in Cape St. Claire.
In some cases, the court has increased its K-9 rounds in the courthouse, especially on the floor where the courtroom is located, Bateman said. But a trial that draws widespread attention doesn't change how deputies operate day-to-day.
"The deputy sheriffs that are assigned to the courthouse are extra vigilant even on the calmest days," he said. "It's not like they jump up the vigilance ... because of a special trial going on. We trained our deputies to be like that all the time."
As the trial draws closer, the court will be able to better plan for security arrangements based on other judge's caseloads during the weeks of the trial, Fredericks said.
While many aspects of visiting the courthouse will remain the same, visitors may notice stricter enforcement of the long-standing policy prohibiting the use of cellphones and cameras in the courtroom during the trial, Fredericks said.
The enforcement is essential in part because of expansive media coverage the trial is expected to garner from major news organizations such as the Associated Press, The Washington Post, The New York Times, and television networks.
News organizations with satellite trucks will be given the courtesy of parking outside the courthouse as long as they don't block traffic or impede emergency vehicles, Fredericks said.
In a statement, New York Times national editor Marc Lacey said, "This is a big national story and we cover big national stories."
Annapolis police have no special plans during the trial, but the department is always available if the situation changes, a city police spokeswoman said. Anne Arundel County police will have a presence in the area as well.
The sheriff's office has also completed training sessions during off-hours to prepare for emergency situations such as confronting an individual with a weapon who enters the courthouse, Fredericks said but the likelihood of an event like that is low.

Texto completo: INDIANOLA, Iowa — Elizabeth Warren said she'll soon unveil a plan to pay for her Medicare for All plan after weeks of criticism for not providing details about a concept long promoted by a Democratic primary rival, Vermont Sen.Bernie Sanders.
Closing out a rally before about 475 people at Simpson College in Indianola, Iowa, the Massachusetts senator and White House hopeful addressed scrutiny that's come her way, particularly from Sanders. Medicare for All would be, in effect, government-financed healthcare with the aim of eliminating private insurance.
"We need to talk about the cost, and I plan over the next few weeks to put a plan that talks about, specifically, the cost of Medicare for All, and specifically, how we pay for it," she said. "This is something I've been working on for months and months, and it's got just a little more work until it's finished."
Warren, 70, reiterated her vow, if elected, "not to sign a bill into law that does not reduce the cost of healthcare for middle class families." But she added that "every single person running for president" knows "the cheapest possible way to make sure that everyone gets healthcare that they need is Medicare for All."
Warren later dismissed a reporter who suggested it was irresponsible to fully endorse Medicare for All without knowing how it would be financed.
"I think there have been many estimates about what the cost would be and many different payment streams. And I've been working on how to give the exact details to make that work," she said.
The former Harvard Law School professor and consumer advocate this week promised to review funding options for Medicare for All.

Hil: Summit pullout not about Tulsi

Texto completo: Hillary Clinton's camp insists her choice to back out of a summit next week has nothing to do with her feud with presidential hopeful Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard.
She "was scheduled to be interviewed at the Fortune Most Powerful Women Summit next week and withdrew," a spokeswoman for the business mag told the Daily News.
The former secretary of state's sudden move fueled speculation she backed out due to Gabbard's participation. On Friday, the lawmaker fired off a mean tweet attack that dubbed Clinton "the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long," and challenged her to "join the race directly."
But Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill told The News her decision to withdraw is "not linked in the slightest" to Gabbard's trash talk. "Couldn't have even told you Gabbard was going," Merrill added in an email.
Instead, Merrill pointed to a Friday Slate article that cites a source close to Clinton (inset) who blames the summit's inclusion of former Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen, known for her role in separating migrant children and their families at the southern border.
"We work with a lot of activists who are trying to do their best to improve this horrible situation down at the border," the source told Slate. "At the end of the day, it's an easy decision. You have to side with them."
When asked to confirm whether Nielsen's scheduled appearance was Clinton's reason for backing out, Merrill told The News, "Yes." As of Saturday afternoon, more than 52,000 people signed an online petition calling for Nielsen to be removed from the summit, taking place Monday to Wednesday in Washington.
Gabbard's Friday tweetstorm came in response to Clinton's claims Thursday that the Russians are "grooming" one of the five female Democratic presidential hopefuls as a third-party candidate who can push their agenda. "She's the favorite of the Russians," Clinton said on a podcast, CNN reports. "They have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far."
At Tuesday's Democratic debate, Gabbard lambasted the "completely despicable" coverage by event broadcaster CNN, as well as The New York Times, that she says has suggested she's a "Russian asset and an Assad apologist."

Texto completo: We found several false and misleading claims in the October Democratic presidential debate:
Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro claimed that the most recent jobs data show that "Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania ... have lost jobs not gained them." In fact, total nonfarm employment in all three states was up in August — and since President Donald Trump took office — according to the most recent preliminary federal data.
Former Vice President Joe Biden was wrong when he said that American troops withdrawing from Syria were "being fired on by [Syrian President Bashar] Assad's people."
Activist and former hedge fund manager Tom Steyer claimed 90% of workers haven't had a raise in 40 years — but a liberal think tank says their real annual wages are up more than 22%.
Sen. Cory Booker claimed that "raising the minimum to $15 an hour ... would put more money in people's pockets than giving them $1,000 a month" under businessman Andrew Yang's universal basic income plan. But Yang's plan would put more money in more pockets than Booker's bill to raise the minimum wage.
Leading economists and tax experts disagree about whether Sen. Elizabeth Warren's proposed wealth tax would generate enough revenue to fund a host of Warren's education priorities. Yang rightly noted that several European countries repealed their wealth taxes, in part because they did not raise as much revenue as projected. But Warren's plan seeks to address some of the weaknesses of those plans.
Yang and Steyer both exaggerated the number of opioid overdose deaths in America by using total drug overdose death figures. Yang also inaccurately attributed all of the deaths to Purdue Pharma.
Biden claimed Medicare for All will cost "at least $30 trillion over 10 years. That is more on a yearly basis than the entire federal budget." It may cost that much, but federal spending is projected to exceed $50 trillion over 10 years. And, while Medicare for All would significantly increase federal spending, it also would eliminate health care spending by individuals, businesses and local governments.
Sen. Bernie Sanders repeated two claims on health care. He said that "500,000 people" are "going bankrupt" due to cancer, but the study he cites only says that medical issues contributed to those bankruptcies — they were not the sole reason. He also said that "87 million Americans are uninsured or underinsured." The figure includes 19.3 million who were insured but had a gap in coverage in the previous year.
Sanders referred to climate change as an "existential threat." Scientists agree climate change does pose a threat to humans and ecosystems, but they do not envision that climate change will obliterate all people from the planet.
Yang repeated a baseless claim that Amazon is responsible for closing "30% of America's stores and malls." In fact, there's evidence that the number of retail stores may actually be increasing.
Twelve candidates met for the Oct. 15 debate hosted by CNN and the New York Times in Westerville, Ohio.
Castro wrong about job losses Castro, a former mayor of San Antonio and HUD secretary, was wrong when he said, "Donald Trump has broken his promises because Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania — actually in the latest jobs data — have lost jobs, not gained them."
In August, which is the most recent month for seasonally adjusted data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, total nonfarm employment went up by 16,500 in Pennsylvania, by 6,100 in Michigan and by 3,700 in Ohio.
Castro's campaign issued a press release during the debate that said the "data from August ... is preliminary due to incomplete data and will be revised by the Bureau of Labor Statistics at the end of this month." The press release added, "This fiscal year, from March through July, the latest month with final numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, non-farm payrolls are down in Ohio, Michigan, and Pennsylvania."
That's all true, but it's not the claim that Castro made during the debate. The "latest jobs data" for states, although preliminary, is for August — not July.
The estimated job gains in August for Pennsylvania and Michigan surpassed the job losses from March through July. However, Ohio has lost 3,600 jobs from March through August.
Furthermore, the campaign's argument is misleading. The fact is, since Trump took office in January 2017, total nonfarm employment is up — not down — in those three states and nationwide. That's whether one measures up to July or August.
Biden wrong on Syria Biden mistakenly said that American troops withdrawing from Syria were "being fired on by [Syrian President Bashar] Assad's people."
According to news reports, Turkish militias fired artillery rounds near a U.S. military outpost in northeastern Syria last week, though no U.S. forces were injured. There have been no reports of Assad's Syrian government forces firing on American troops.
Biden: I would not have withdrawn the troops and I would not have withdrawn the additional thousand troops who are in Iraq, which are in retreat now, being fired on by Assad's people.
After a phone call on Oct. 6 with Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, President Donald Trump announced he would be withdrawing troops from northern Syria. After initially withdrawing 50 American troops from the Syrian border with Turkey, the Pentagon this week began pulling out all of its 1,000 soldiers from Syria, a process that was expected to take several weeks.
With the U.S. troop withdrawal, Syrian government forces have moved to retake territory in the country's northeast, but there have been no reports that they have fired upon retreating U.S. forces, as Biden said.
New York Times, Oct. 14: Syrian government forces streamed into the country's northeast on Monday, seizing towns where they had not stepped foot in years and filling a vacuum opened up by President Trump's decision to abandon the United States' Syrian Kurdish allies.
Less than a week after Turkey launched an incursion into northern Syria with Mr. Trump's assent, President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, considered a war criminal by the United States, has benefited handsomely, striking a deal with the United States' former allies to take the northern border and rapidly gaining territory without a fight.
News reports made no mention of Syrian forces firing upon withdrawing U.S. troops, though.
Steyer wrong on wages Tom Steyer, the billionaire liberal activist, was wrong when he claimed that "90 percent of Americans have not had a raise for 40 years."
Even the liberal Economic Policy Institute — a think tank that advocates for low- and middle-income earners — reported in February of this year that the annual wages of the bottom 90% of wage earners have gone up 22.2% since 1979, even after adjustment for inflation. (See Appendix Figure A.)
And that's only through 2017. Wages have risen further since then. Average weekly earnings of all production and nonsupervisory wage earners in the private sector have gone up 2.1% (after adjustment for inflation) between December 2017 and last month, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
EPI reports that wage growth has been "sluggish" for the vast majority of workers, compared with a 157% increase for the highest-paid 1% of earners since 1979. But Steyer goes too far when he claims there has been no growth at all.
Minimum wage hike vs. universal basic income When asked about how he would convince GM workers to end their strike, Booker took the opportunity to compare his bill to increase the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour to Yang's universal basic income plan.
Booker: Well, first of all, the one point I wanted to make about the UBI conversation — and I hope that my friend, Andrew Yang, will come out for this — doing more for workers than UBI would actually be just raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour. It would put more money in people's pockets than giving them $1,000 a month.
Raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour would eventually put more than $1,000 a month in some pockets, but Yang's so-called "Freedom Dividend" would pay "$1,000 per month, or $12,000 per year, to all U.S. citizens over the age of 18 ... no questions asked."
Booker is a cosponsor of "Raise the Wage Act," which would increase the minimum wage to $15, but not until six years after enactment. Under the bill, there would be a seven-step phase-in period, beginning with $8.40 an hour and then increasing $1.10 per hour each year for the next six years.
"The annual earnings for a full-time minimum-wage worker is $15,080 at the current federal minimum wage of $7.25," according to the Center for Poverty Research at the University of California, Davis. An increase to $15 per hour would more than double that to $31,200 — a difference of $16,120, or $1,343 a month.
But it would take five years for a person earning minimum wage to earn more than $1,000 a month in additional income.
Under the Raise the Wage Act, the minimum raise would increase to $8.40 an hour no later than 90 days after the bill is signed into law. That's an increase of $199 more per month — compared with Yang's $1,000-per-month plan.
Five years after the bill takes effect, the minimum wage would increase to $13.90 an hour, providing an additional $1,153 per month. The $15 minimum wage would be fully implemented six years after the bill takes effect, providing $1,343 per month in additional income.
After seven years, Yang's plan would have provided $1,000 a month, while the phasing-in of the minimum wage would provide only an average of $771 a month.
Also, unlike Yang's plan, the minimum wage pay hike would not affect every American. And increasing the minimum wage to $15 per hour would result in job losses, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
In a July report, CBO said a $15 minimum wage would directly increase the wages of 17 million workers, but "1.3 million other workers would become jobless."
Yang's plan would put more money in more pockets than raising the minimum wage.
Warren's wealth tax As she has in past debates, Warren ticked off a list of things she says could be paid for with her proposal for an annual wealth tax on all assets over $50 million. As we have written, it is a matter of debate among economists and tax experts as to whether her plan would raise as much as she expects.
One of Warren's challengers at the debate, Yang, noted that several European countries have repealed their wealth taxes "because it had massive implementation problems and did not generate the revenue that they'd projected." That's backed up in a report from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. But the report also argues that a wealth tax is likely needed to close the wealth inequality gap, and it outlines a number of proposed improvements to make a wealth tax more effective than those in Europe. Warren's plan incorporates many of those suggestions.
Under Warren's plan, households would pay an annual 2% tax on all assets — net worth — above $50 million, and a 3% tax on every dollar of net worth above $1 billion. During the debate, Warren highlighted some of the things that tax could bankroll.
Warren: And right now in America, the top 0.1 percent have so much wealth — understand this — that if we put a 2 cent tax on their 50 millionth and first dollar, and on every dollar after that, we would have enough money to provide universal child care for every baby in this country, age zero to 5, universal pre-K for every child, raise the wages of every child care worker and preschool teacher in America, provide for universal tuition-free college, put $50 billion into historically black colleges and universities ... and cancel student loan debt for 95 percent of the people who have it.
Warren estimates her wealth tax would raise $2.75 trillion over 10 years, based on an analysis by University of California, Berkeley economists Gabriel Zucman and Emmanuel Saez, who study wealth inequality.
When we wrote about Warren's plan back in June in our story "Facts on Warren's Wealth Tax Plan," we noted that several prominent economists and tax experts cast doubt on Warren's estimate of the revenue the tax would generate, warning that wealthy people would find ways to avoid the tax.
Yang noted that that was one of the reasons several European countries scrapped their wealth tax plans.
Yang: And a wealth tax makes a lot of sense in principle. The problem is that it's been tried in Germany, France, Denmark, Sweden, and all those countries ended up repealing it, because it had massive implementation problems and did not generate the revenue that they'd projected. If we can't learn from the failed experiences of other countries, what can we learn from? We should not be looking to other countries' mistakes.
Indeed, while as many as a dozen countries in Europe had a wealth tax in the early 1990s, that number has dropped to three as of 2018, according to an OECD report. (In 2018, France replaced its net wealth tax with a new real estate wealth tax.)
"Decisions to repeal net wealth taxes have often been justified by efficiency and administrative concerns and by the observation that net wealth taxes have frequently failed to meet their redistributive goals," the report stated. "The revenues collected from net wealth taxes have also, with a few exceptions, been very low."
However, the report "also argues that capital income taxes alone will most likely not be enough to address wealth inequality and suggests the need to complement capital income taxes with a form of wealth taxation."
The report makes several recommendations to bolster the effectiveness of a wealth tax — lessons learned from the European examples. Warren's plan has attempted to incorporate many of those suggestions.
For example, the OECD report recommends a wealth tax only be levied on the very wealthy, that the rate should be low, exemptions and reliefs should be limited (to prevent those subject to the tax from moving assets into exempted categories), and that payments should be allowed in installments for those "facing liquidity constraints." All of those are part of Warren's plan.
Under the Warren plan, those with liquidity issues would be able to defer tax payments, with interest, for up to five years. And to guard against wealthy Americans simply moving out of the country to avoid the wealth tax, Warren's plan would assess a one-time 40% "exit tax" on the net worth above $50 million for those who renounce their citizenship. We take no position on whether those provisions in the Warren plan would address the lower-than-expected revenues generated by some European countries that tried a wealth tax, but we simply note that there is significant disagreement among economists and tax experts.
Biden on Medicare for all As he has done in past debates, Biden repeatedly criticized the Medicare for All proposal as a budget buster, saying it would increase federal spending by $30 trillion over 10 years. But Biden ignored that nearly all health care spending by businesses, local governments and individuals would go away.
At one point, Biden said: "The plan is going to cost at least $30 trillion over 10 years. That is more on a yearly basis than the entire federal budget." He turned to the issue later in the debate, saying something similar: "It costs $30 trillion. Guess what? That's over $3 trillion — it's more than the entire federal budget."
We should start out by saying that $30 trillion over 10 years is not "more than the entire federal budget." In its August report on long-term budget projections, the Congressional Budget Office estimates federal outlays will be $57.8 trillion over 10 years, from 2020 to 2029.
Also, as we've explained before, we don't know how much Medicare for All would cost, since many details are yet to be determined. But two estimates, one by the Urban Institute and another by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, said the federal government cost would be $32 trillion or $32.6 trillion over 10 years.
The government would have to raise taxes or fees, or cut other spending, to cover the costs.

Texto completo: This is a memo for the politically homeless. It's a memo to those of us who could never support Donald Trump but think the Bernie-Squad-Warren Democratic Party is sprinting too far left. It's a memo built around the following question: If the general election campaign turns out to be Trump vs. Warren, what the heck are we supposed to do?
The first thing we could do, of course, is pray for a miracle. Maybe the Democrats will nominate one of the five B's or the K: Biden, Buttigieg, Booker, Bennet, Bullock or Klobuchar.
These candidates are pluralists, not purists. They make many voters who disagree with them feel heard and respected. They practice the craft of politics, building majority coalitions to get things done.
If the party nominated one of those six, you really could see the Democrats gather progressives and moderates into an enduring majority coalition as the Republicans recede into old, white, rural obsolescence. You could see movement on a range of issues where large majorities are already stacked on one side: guns, climate change, reducing income inequality, expanding health coverage.
But right now, Elizabeth Warren has the momentum, and so those of us who feel politically homeless may face a stark choice.
For many, supporting Warren is too high a price to pay, even for ousting Trump. "There is no universe where I will ever vote for Donald Trump, and there is no universe where I could ever vote for Elizabeth Warren," Jennifer Horn, a former chairwoman of the New Hampshire GOP, told The Washington Examiner.
And you can see why so many people have that reaction.
First, there are Warren's policies. On trade, she's a protectionist. Her 10-year, $34 trillion health care plan isn't paid for. Her student debt cancellation plan is a handout to the upper middle class. Her campaign seems to not acknowledge the inevitable trade-off between economic growth and high spending, high taxes and high regulation.
Second, she's one of the few Democrats who could actually lose. As Yascha Mounk notes in The Atlantic, Democrats won in 2018 because they won back a lot of nonpartisan suburban office park workers who found moderates they could vote for. When you remind independents of Democratic support for abolishing private health insurance and decriminalizing unauthorized border crossing - two key Warren policies - they become six percentage points less likely to vote for the Democrats. Trump will tell voters: You may despise me, but she'll destroy the economy.
Third, a Warren presidency would be deeply polarizing and probably unsuccessful. Warren's policy ideas would make any progressive-moderate coalition impossible. She'd try to govern with her 40% partisan base, just as Trump has, which is no way to pass big legislation.
Fourth, there is a wave of insular intolerance coursing through parts of the American left. If given executive power, some progressives may use it to cancel any culture or faith other than their own.
And yet .
And yet, if it comes to Trump vs. Warren in a general election, the only plausible choice is to support Warren. Over the past month, Donald Trump has given us fresh reminders of the unique and exceptional ways he corrupts American life. You're either part of removing that corruption or you are not. When your nation's political system is in danger, staying home and not voting is not a responsible option.
Politics is downstream from morality and culture. Warren represents a policy wrong turn, in my view, but policies can be argued about and reversed. Trump represents a much more important and fundamental threat - to the norms, values, standards and soul of this country.
Last week, Trump all but greenlighted the ethnic cleansing of Kurds without an ounce of remorse. He normalizes dishonesty and valorizes cruelty. His letter to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan reminds us yet again that we have a president whose professional competence is at kindergarten level. Once a nation has lost its heart, mind and soul, it is very hard to get these things back.
Furthermore, Trump is an unprecedented threat to democratic institutions. Over the past few years, I've thought the progressive fears of incipient American fascism were vastly overblown. But, especially over the past month, Trump has worked overtime to validate those fears and to raise the horrifying specter of what he'll be like if he is given a second term and is vindicated, unhinged and unwell.
In their book "How Democracies Die," Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt argue that authoritarians undermine democracy in several ways. They reject the democratic rules of the game, the unwritten norms we rely upon to make the political system work. They deny the legitimacy of their political opponents, using extreme language to deny them standing as co-citizens. They tolerate or even encourage violence, threatening to take legal action against critics in rival parties.
Trump has been guilty of all three sins, and given a second term he will feel free to stomp where up until now he has merely tread.
This election is about whether we can hold together as a functioning nation, across our economic, racial, geographic and ideological divides. In such circumstances, a bad option is better than a suicidal one.

Maryland Fights Clean Water Rollback

Texto completo: The Environmental Protection Agency revoked two regulations last month dealing with clean water and air that present conflicting positions from the Trump Administration over the role states should play in protecting their own natural resources.
The first came in the removal of an Obama-era rule that sought to protect streams, lakes, wetlands and other bodies of water from pollution, a move state officials say threatens the Chesapeake Bay.
"(The Trump Administration's) determination to weaken the Clean Water Act threatens to undo our hard-won progress cleaning up (waterways) in Maryland and across the nation," Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh said in a statement. "We plan to vigorously challenge this latest unlawful rollback."
The 2015 Clean Water Rule expanded the definition of "navigable" bodies of water that fall under federal jurisdiction. It was a decision that Trump EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler called "an egregious power grab" at a Sept. 12 press conference announcing the repeal.
"When President Trump took office he immediately set into motion a process to remove and replace regulations that were stifling economic development," he said. "The Obama administration's 2015 'Waters of the U.S.' definition was at the top of the list."
A replacement to the rule has not yet been announced.
Under the Clean Water Act, it is illegal to pollute in U.S. bodies of water without a permit. Under the 2015 rule, the Obama administration, working in collaboration with the Army Corps of Engineers, adopted the new rule to clarify which waterways were defined as federal, a change that impacted about three percent of the country's waters.
For farming and ranching advocates, however, the rule was a burdensome overreach that significantly raised the legal risks of pollution. According to the American Farm Bureau, the 2015 definition of "waters of the United States" made it unclear whether extremely minor bodies of water like ditches or streams could be subject to federal enforcement.
"We're all supportive of water quality," said Don Parrish, AFB senior director of congressional relations. "But farmers deserve clarity."
Environmental advocates say the rollback won't have a major impact within Maryland, as the state has stronger water protections than the federal government to begin with. However, pollution could migrate from states like Delaware and West Virginia that follow federal regulations, according to Maryland Environment Secretary Ben Grumbles.
"The loss of a federal safety net for wetlands and waters upstream of us will threaten our Chesapeake Bay progress," Grumbles said in a statement.
A preliminary analysis of the impacts of revoking the Obama rule completed by the Maryland Department of the Environment showed that up to 2.3 million pounds of nitrogen and 57,000 pounds of phosphorus could enter the Chesapeake Bay.
According to Jon Mueller, the vice president for litigation at the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, cooperative state efforts like preventing pollution in the Bay necessitate strong federal protections in states with less stringent water quality rules.
"Even if you have strong state laws, you can only protect things within your state for the most part," Mueller said.
Mueller added that EPA regulations create a baseline floor for protection in most states, and "when that floor moves lower, the protections in those states that follow federal law are removed."
Both the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection denounced the rollback, citing water quality concerns.
The EPA noted that expanding federal jurisdiction over clean water "failed to adequately recognize, preserve, and protect the primary responsibilities and rights of states to manage their own land and water resources."
But the following week, the EPA revoked a rule that seemingly contradicts this stance. On Sept. 17, the EPA moved to take away California's authority to set its own emission standards, which 13 other states, including Maryland, follow.
Frosh subsequently joined 25 other attorneys general in a lawsuit challenging the administration, arguing that the new regulation "fails to respect states' authority to protect public health and welfare."
Wheeler said at a press conference that the administration would be moving forward with a new national fuel economy and greenhouse emission standard for cars.
"We embrace federalism and the role of the states, but federalism does not mean that one state can dictate standards for the nation," he said.
The Trump Administration has scaled back more than 50 environmental regulations since the president took office, according to The New York Times. Dozens more rollbacks are in the works.
The EPA is considering a change to Section 401 of the Clean Water Act, a provision that allows individual states to block construction of interstate projects like pipelines or dams that damage water quality. Maryland has opposed construction of the Potomac Pipeline, which would bring natural gas to West Virginia from Pennsylvania and cross through Maryland public land.
Environmentalists say the proposed adjustment, which is under a public comment period, limits the time states have to assess projects for potential impacts.
"It's not being done with the public's interest in mind, it's not being done with the states' interest in mind," said Anne Havemann, general counsel for the Chesapeake Climate Action Network. "It's directly rolling back what the states want to do and are trying to do."

Apple accedes to China’s despotic demands

Texto completo: Apple chief executive Tim Cook has said “companies should have values, just like people do.” He’s right. But it is difficult to champion democratic values while doing business in a country that runs on speech-stifling authoritarianism.
China is Apple’s third-largest market, and it brings the company $44 billion per year in sales, plus countless ethical headaches. Last week brought several, all surrounding the ongoing anti-government protests in Hong Kong. Apple hid the Taiwanese flag emoji from its keyboard for those tapping away on the island. It booted the news outlet Quartz from the Chinese version of its app store after its aggressive coverage of the unrest. And then there was HKmap.live, an app designed for Hong Kongers to avoid law enforcement amid violent crackdowns. Apple, at first, rejected the app. Then it approved it. Then, finally, it removed it.
Apple says its decision to yank HKmap.live wasn’t a matter of capitulation to the Chinese regime, but rather of internal enforcement. The tool’s tracking function was abused to attack police, as well as to commit crimes in unpatrolled areas, and that ran counter to Apple’s guidelines. But the company’s reversal came after the ruling party’s official newspaper, The People’s Daily, declared that Apple’s support for “toxic apps” made the company “an accomplice to the rioters.”
Quartz was another story. Apple complies with local laws wherever it operates, and President Xi Jinping’s laws don’t respect press freedom. Apple removed the app because China said to do so, just as it removed The New York Times’s almost three years ago.
Apple justifies acceding to despotic demands by arguing that it is the cost of operating in China, and that the Chinese people are better off with a big U.S. firm around than without. Apple and its peers can facilitate a freer flow of information — not to mention better privacy protections, on many of which the company says it will not compromise — than homegrown firms. The question, of course, is how free. Sometimes, corporations might go to the mat for what’s right, and sometimes they might win. But, other times, they will lose, and then they are left with a choice to leave China altogether or help warp the world its residents are allowed to see.
When the United States and its allies made the decision to engage with China, they imagined that economic growth and trade would promote political liberalization and a convergence of values. That hasn’t happened. Instead, there is competition between vastly different sets of values, and China doesn’t hesitate to use the lure of its market to demand fealty to its propaganda line. Apple, the National Basketball Association and other businesses should resist — but they need help. The United States should negotiate not only over soybean purchases and steel quotas but also to protect free speech and other liberties that China would erode.

Warren would sink booming economy

Texto completo: With three polls showing her in the lead, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., may soon eclipse former vice president Joe Biden as the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination. That's great news for Republicans, because Warren has a problem: The central message of her campaign is that the economy is working for the very wealthy but it is not working for ordinary Americans. Unfortunately for her, ordinary Americans disagree.
A Marist poll asked voters whether "the economy is working well for you personally." Nearly two-thirds of Americans said yes. This includes large majorities in almost every demographic group. Sixty-seven percent of college graduates and 64% of those without a college education say the economy is working for them. So do 68% of whites, and 61% of nonwhite people. So do Americans of every generation: 63% of Generation Z and millennials; 69% of Generation X; 63% of baby boomers; and 69% of Greatest Generation and Silent Generation voters. So do supermajorities in every region in the country: 60% in the West, 65% in the Northeast, 67% in the Midwest, and 68% in the South. So do most voters in every type of American community: 63% of both big and small city voters; 64% of small-town voters; 66% of rural voters; and 72% of suburban voters. Most everyone, it seems, says the economy is working for them.
The only groups who disagree, Marist found, are progressives (59%), Democratic women (55%) and those who are liberal or very liberal (55%). So, when Warren declares that President Trump is "part of a corrupt, rigged system that has helped the wealthy and the well-connected and kicked dirt in the faces of everyone else," it resonates with almost no one except those on the political left.
There is a good reason for that. Unemployment is near a record low, and the United States has about 1.6 million more job openings than unemployed people to fill them. Not only are jobs plentiful, but wages are rising. And the New York Times reported in May that "over the past year, low-wage workers have experienced the fastest pay increases." Americans don't just think they are doing better in the Trump economy, they are doing better. Little wonder Democrats barely mentioned the economy in Tuesday's debate.
This progress is bad news for Warren. Why on earth would Americans rally to her call for "big structural change" to the economy when they say the economy is working for them? Especially when they learn the structural changes Warren is proposing would cost tens of trillions of dollars and - whether she admits it or not - would require them to pay more in taxes?
Manhattan Institute budget expert Brian Riedl recently added up the price tag for Warren's proposals, and the numbers are staggering: $30 trillion to $40 trillion over 10 years for Medicare-for-all; $2 trillion for Social Security expansion; $3 trillion for climate change and environmental policies; $2 trillion free college and student loan forgiveness; and another $1 trillion for initiatives that include free child care and housing. "Total cost: $38 trillion to $48 trillion," Riedl said. And that's before calculating the cost of offering free government health care to illegal immigrants, which Warren supports. There's no way to pay for that miasma of spending with Warren's wealth tax; it will require massive middle-class tax increases.
No wonder the so-called moderates were going after Warren so hard at Tuesday's debate; they know it would be a disaster if she were to capture the Democratic nomination. To win in 2020, Democrats need to win over voters who like Trump's policies but don't like Trump. They can't do that by telling these voters they are wrong about the economy working for them, and that they need to make peace with socialism. Instead, they need to convince voters that they can dump Trump and still keep their prosperity.
If Democrats nominate Warren, they will give voters suffering from Trump exhaustion no safe harbor. Her nomination would turn the election into an existential threat to the American economy. And since Warren said Tuesday that, if she is elected, and Democrats take back the Senate, they will "repeal the filibuster," she will be able to pass her radical agenda by simple majority vote. That means Trump's message - "whether you love me or hate me, you have got to vote for me" - will ring true for millions of Americans whose votes might otherwise be up for grabs.

SpongeBob sings, Almodóvar returns, and Holzer takes over

Texto completo: The wind seems to have blown everything all over the place, but thankfully, the most important squares on the calendar appear to have remained intact. Yes, I'm talking about the weekend (seriously, what else do I ever talk/think about?).
If venturing outside doesn't seem immediately like the best idea, fear not: This weekend's weather looks pretty chill (both senses) and we've got three movies (with no less than three stars), a couple of plays, some drag, some dance, some Brahms, and even some (lowercase) turkey to keep you off the streets, and your hat on your head. Read on!
SOAK IT IN: Right about now seems like the perfect time to, say, sink to the very bottom of the sea. And what luck! Now through Oct. 27 , you can plunge into the relentlessly cheerful underwater world of “The SpongeBob Musical" at the Boch Center Wang Theatre. Globe theater critic Don Aucoin calls the show a “joy machine" and an “exuberant acid trip of a musical [that] will be a decidedly love-it-or-hate-it proposition" depending on how salty you are. The “acrobatic and likable Lorenzo Pugliese" stars as the titular Porifera, and “has a disposition so relentlessly sunny he makes Pollyanna look like Samuel Beckett."
CLASS CLASH: Follow Globe film critic Ty Burr's four stars straight to your seat in front of “Parasite," the hotly anticipated return from South Korean director Bong Joon-ho (“Snowpiercer"), who “combines the cool virtuosity of a Hitchcock with the devilish social satire of Luis Buñuel" to create “his funniest, most biting, and bleakest work to date." It's both a “sly black comedy" and “a story of social hierarchy and what it does to people, a film about the upper classes, the lower depths, and maybe even the floors below that." (It also took the top prize at Cannes this year.) Now screening at Kendall Square and Coolidge Corner.
HURTS SO GOOD: I probably do not need to alert devoted fans of Pedro Almodóvar that his latest film, “Pain and Glory," is now screening . But after some iffy entries into his oeuvre (sorry, “I'm So Excited," I just wasn't that into you) I do feel compelled to alert you that 40 years in, Pedro's still got it. Globe critic Mark Feeney gives three stars to this “understated" portrait of an aging film director (which could either be a reflection or a refraction of the auteur in question). “One of the quiet marvels of this understated yet often deeply moving film," Feeney writes, “is how skillfully — which is to say unobtrusively — the filmmaker weaves together past and present." As such, an ensemble of familiar faces light up the screen, including Antonio Banderas, Julieta Serrano, and Penélope Cruz. It's screening this weekend at Kendall Square. BYOT (tissues).
JUST THE TWO OF US: And should you require a three-movie weekend, set your course for “The Lighthouse," a roiling, rocky, “lo-fi, high-impact" psycho-horror from director Robert Eggers (“The Witch"), and starring Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson as a pair of “wickies" (a.k.a. lighthouse keepers) seemingly abandoned on a seemingly enchanted (the bad way) rock — as well as within Eggers's boxy, black-and-white vision. What comes out in the wash is something like a nightmarish buddy comedy, or as Globe film contributor Tom Russo says in his three-star review, “a masterful study of souls trapped on a rock alone, but also trapped together, with all the twisty complexities involved." Bring a date! Now screening.
POETRY IN MOTION: At the ICA Saturday , you have a chance to catch Zimbabwe-born and Brooklyn-based choreographer-performer nora chipaumire's latest work, “#PUNK 100% POP *N!&GA" — a challenging and invigorating mix of dance, the music and lyrics of Patti Smith, Grace Jones, and Rit Nzele (plus a set design by Ari Marcopoulos and Kara Walker) that will have you out of your seat. (No, really, she doesn't do that stage/audience thing, so bring comfortable shoes.) Globe dance contributor Karen Campbell says, “ '#Punk' has a raw, unfettered quality that pushes boundaries — and undoubtedly a few buttons." Don't miss this.
DIVA FEVER: On Saturday , you can catch a riotous pair of performances from the riotous pairing of drag superstar Varla Jean Merman and Emmy-winning comedian and writer Judy Gold as the Huntington Theatre Company & Mark Cortale present “The Judy & Varla Show" at the BCA's Calderwood Pavilion. “We're kind of doing our old gays and old Jews act," Gold told the Globe, “since we've both survived in the business, and neither one of us is bagging groceries — yet." Gerald Goode mans the piano as these two indefatigable divas proverbially camp out on stage. Wear your best pearls for clutching.
DIG IN: At Boston Lyric Stage this weekend (and through Nov. 10 ) you can get an early serving of turkey(s) in the form of “The Thanksgiving Play," a “sharp-edged" satire from playwright Larissa FastHorse, and, notes Globe contributor Christopher Wallenberg, “the first work by a Native American playwright to appear on American Theatre Magazine's annual survey of the year's most produced plays at regional theaters nationwide." The comedy finds “a troupe of performers, writers, and teaching artists . . . valiantly straining to create a culturally sensitive 'devised' work of theater, aimed at an elementary school audience, that simultaneously celebrates the American national holiday while also honoring Native American Heritage Month." Imagine a comically woke take on “Waiting for Guffman" and you'll get a sense of what's on the menu. It couldn't be any more awkward than your actual family's Turkey Day — actually I take that back.
GET YOUR PHIL: If you haven't experienced Benjamin Zander helming your experience of classical music, listen to his TED Talk on its “transformative power," and then watch him lead the Boston Philharmonic through a program of Mozart (Overture to “The Magic Flute"), Brahms (Piano Concerto No. 2, featuring the spellbinding Italian pianist Alessandro Deljavan), and Bartok (Concerto for Orchestra) this weekend at Jordan Hall (on Saturday evening) and at Harvard's Sanders Theatre (on Sunday afternoon). And get there early to hear Zander's lucid and elucidating introduction to the program, which will be like getting fit with a fresh pair of ears.
AMERICAN GRAFFITI: And lastly from the outside world, one of the most important and instantly recognizable artists of the last century (and, I might add, the Weekender's personal favorite), Jenny Holzer, is the subject of a massive retrospective (on view through 2020 ) at Mass MoCA in North Adams. Holzer's signature projections, LED signs, posters, and stunning paintings, sculpture, and prints — and their all-caps announcement of enduring “Truisms" like “ABUSE OF POWER COMES AS NO SURPRISE" and “PROTECT ME FROM WHAT I WANT" — will scatter across the museum's 61-acre campus. (Not to worry, she'll have a bunch of her benches there too.) And remember, EVERYONE'S WORK IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT — hers is just a little better.
OR STAY IN: Because whoa, that wind is wild. A less blustery option is parking it on the couch for “Modern Love," a new Amazon anthology series from John Carney (of “Once" and “Sing Street") fame, based on the popular New York Times romance column, and starring the likes of Anne Hathaway, Cristin Milioti, John Slattery, Tina Fey, Dev Patel, and “Mr. Hot Priest himself," Andrew Scott. “While the eight half-hours of 'Modern Love' have the sparkling feel of urban romantic comedy," writes Globe television critic Matthew Gilbert, “they're about the very many faces of love out there in the world." Its now available on Amazon.
And if you like to end your Weekend with a nice case of unsettling dread, maybe check out the premiere of Damon Lindelof's “remix" of the comic-book mainstay “The Watchmen" on HBO. “It's set in an alternate 2019, under President Robert Redford, with white supremacists conflicting with cops in Oklahoma." Hold on . . . I thought this was the alternate 2019. Anyhoo, that's Sunday at 9 p.m. on HBO.
And that, windblown Weekenders, is all I've got in the forecast for you this time out. Hang on to your hats, keep an eye on the sky, and however you spend this weekend, make it one you'll miss come Monday.
See you next time!

TELEVISION REVIEW; 'Love' stories to hold on to; A new Amazon series is built of relationship essays. These episodes are the real keepers.

Texto completo: Correction: "Modern Love": In the Oct. 19 Calendar section, an article about the new Amazon series "Modern Love" said the series takes its name, theme and most of its main characters and story lines from a weekly column in the Style section of the New York Times. The section is called Sunday Styles.
"Modern Love," a new series from Amazon, takes its name, theme and most of its main characters and story lines, such as they are, from a weekly column in the Style section of the New York Times: Guest writers tell a personal tale of love in all its shapes, sizes, colors, flavors and ages. (It is also a podcast, in which well known actors read the columns.)
The series is just about what you might expect from the Style section of the New York Times coming to life: a little patrician, kind of pleased with itself, but well made and certainly good-looking.
It's an anthology, a respectable-sounding word, and episodes play like short stories, though even at 30 minutes, much elaboration is necessary -- building out characters, adding dialogue and drama and comedy. Broadly speaking, they are peopled by creative types, like the mostly professional writers whose columns these are. They're well-to-do, or well-enough-to-do.

When I say that it is not only a letter to love but a location-shot love letter to New York, you are correct in interpreting this to mean it is like a Woody Allen movie.
The series was developed by John Carney, who directed "Once" and wrote and directed "Sing Street" and knows a thing or two about putting a lump in the throat of the slightly arty mass market. Its cast is starry yet interesting: Anne Hathaway, Tina Fey, John Slattery, Catherine Keener, Dev Patel, Andrew Scott and Jane Alexander. It's a pro job, though at times it feels professional in a Madison Avenue kind of way, as if you are being sold something, rather than being told a story. Most feel minor, even when the subject is major, perhaps because they're so faithful to spirit of the essays. I don't mean that as a criticism. And I did choke up a few times.
A range of stories is clearly what Carney had in mind. And yet in two episodes (maybe three), a main character conceals a mental health condition. In two episodes, characters stay up until dawn and learn something important. Two episodes -- three, at a tiny stretch -- involve surrogate fathers. Two include trips to the zoo.
Nothing says you have to watch them all. But you might spare half an hour to watch Fey and Slattery bat lines at each other in a passive-aggressive double act, no? Or maybe Hathaway dancing in a supermarket parking lot is more your thing. To help you decide, I bring you this semi-informative, quasi-scientific, intermittently analogous field guide to the rare birds and odd ducks of "Modern Love."
"When the Doorman Is Your Main Man"
Cristin Milioti is a freelance book reviewer somehow able to afford a nest in a building with a white-glove doorman (Laurentiu Possa) who is protective but not territorial, able to smell a bad boyfriend at 60 paces. (The apartment was passed down in the family, so the rent is low, we are pointedly told.) Well, I thought it was rather sweet, in spite of Los Angeles being characterized as "phony."
"When Cupid Is a Prying Journalist"
Catherine Keener plays a reporter, based on essayist Deborah Copaken (war photographer, TV producer, novelist, you don't want to know), interviewing tech success Dev Patel for the New York Times Sunday magazine -- you can bet your meta. The talk turns to lost love. Each has a story. Courtship ritual: "She told me about her plans to set up a file-sharing app, I told her about my ideas to set up a dating site." Zoo: Bronx.
"Rallying to Keep the Game Alive"
The one with Fey and Slattery. Written and directed by Sharon Horgan ("Catastrophe") from a column by novelist Ann Leary, the wife of Denis Leary -- which accounts for Slattery's character being an actor named Denis, though he's more Roger Sterling than Leary here. The stars play a married couple who may be coming to the end of their relationship, or maybe not. Habitat: Central Park West. Main metaphors: penguins, tennis. Who's that cameo? It's Ted Allen from "Chopped."
"Take Me As I Am, Whoever I Am"
Terri Cheney (high-powered showbiz lawyer turned mental health advocate, author of "Manic: A Memoir" and "The Dark Side of Innocence: Growing Up Bipolar") wrote the essay on which it's is based. Hathaway convincingly changes her feathers from sparkly to darkly as the mood strikes her (without warning), confusing a suitor, among others. Habitat: Fairway Market's Red Hook, Brooklyn, branch, in whose parking lot an imaginary production number takes place. Who's that cameo? Judd Hirsch!
"At the Hospital, an Interlude of Clarity"
The woman (Sofia Boutella) wears the plumage while the man (John Gallagher Jr.) is drably arrayed in this story of a date that goes good by going bad. Previously mentioned categories this fits: mental health; all-night hang, like "Before Sunrise," but with surgery and prescription drugs. Range of habitats: $2,200/month apartment; hospital; pretty little park.
"So He Looked Like Dad. It Was Just Dinner, Right?"
Fatherless Julia Garner imprints fatherhood upon handsome boss Shea Whigham, who gets the wrong idea. (Inter-species communication is difficult.) Audrey Wells' script (directed by actress Emmy Rossum) goes further than Abby Sher's one-dinner essay. A rom-com in which the rom is wrong (it's not even rom). Kind of creepy but a little poignant too. Zoo: Prospect Park, by the seals.
"Hers Was a World of One"
Adapted from Dan Savage's much darker "DJ's Homeless Mommy," set alight to warm the cockles of the heart and make s'mores over. Andrew Scott and Brandon Kyle Goodman play a gay couple looking to adopt; Olivia Cooke is the pregnant, homeless-as-lifestyle girl -- a hobo, I guess -- who moves in and turns their lives upside down. Gratuitous French film reference (mine): Jean Renoir's "Boudu Saved From Drowning" (1932). Who's that cameo? It's Ed Sheeran, not as himself.
"The Race Grows Sweeter Near Its Final Lap"
Author/runner/cousin of the person for whom the Pell Grant is named Eve Pell wrote the source essay, a story of late-life love. Main melody: The voice of Jane Alexander, almost 80. (James Salto, 16 years Alexander's junior, plays her significant other.) Not much in the way of plot, and you should expect the expected, but sightings of Alexander are rare enough to be savored. Secondary melody: Bobby Short's "I Happen to Like New York" (the Cafe Carlyle version) to wrap up. If you catch just those few minutes, you'll have seen some great television.

Texto completo: Tim Sanford, the longtime artistic director at the prestigious Off Broadway theater, will turn over the reins to his deputy, Adam Greenfield.
Tim Sanford arrived at Playwrights Horizons as an intern in 1984. He's been there ever since.
Now, after nearly a quarter century as the artistic director of one of Off Broadway's most acclaimed nonprofits, Sanford is announcing his departure.
The theater's next season -- its 50th -- will be his last as artistic director, and at that point he will have led the organization for half of its history. He will be succeeded by his longtime deputy, the theater's associate artistic director, Adam Greenfield.
"I started thinking about what else there is in life," Sanford, who is 65, said in an interview. He said he would not retire, but would look for new ways to be active. "I still feel like I've got a lot left in the tank."
Playwrights Horizons, which stages six or seven productions a year, describes itself as a "writer's theater," with an emphasis on contemporary American work and relationships with many of the nation's leading playwrights. The organization has an impressive track record, including six Pulitzer Prize-winning plays, three of which were presented during Sanford's tenure as artistic director -- "The Flick," "Clybourne Park" and "I Am My Own Wife."
A midsize organization with an annual budget of about $ 13 million and a staff of 50, Playwrights Horizons operates primarily in Hell's Kitchen, where it has two theaters, one with 198 seats and another with 128. The company also runs an undergraduate theater school that is affiliated with N.Y.U.
It is the rare theater that still accepts unsolicited scripts -- a practice that rarely leads to productions, but allows the organization to develop relationships with artists who seem to have promise. "The message it sends to that sweet and crazy community of people who write plays is profound," Sanford said.
Playwrights Horizons frequently stages challenging work by early-career artists -- its celebrated current show, Will Arbery's "Heroes of the Fourth Turning," gives a rich airing to conservative religious viewpoints, while its most recent musical, Michael R. Jackson's "A Strange Loop," is described by its protagonist as being about "one lone black gay boy I knew who chose to turn his back on the Lord."
Over the course of his tenure, Sanford has had plenty of successes (in addition to the Pulitzer winners, there were Broadway transfers like "Grey Gardens" and breakout plays like "Circle Mirror Transformation," by Annie Baker, and "Dance Nation," by Clare Barron), as well as his share of bad reviews.
Sometimes, the victories and the challenges came with the same show, as with "The Flick," a slow-paced drama about three employees of a small movie theater, also written by Baker. Sanford thought "The Flick" was "the great American play," but so many patrons disliked it -- 50 people walked out on the first Tuesday night -- that he wound up attempting an outreach effort that backfired.
"I sent an email to subscribers, addressing the fact that so many of them hated it, and I felt I was giving a defense of the play, but to some outside eyes it looked like I was being defensive and apologizing," he said. "The mistake I made was really underestimating the digital world -- I learned there is no such thing as a private letter to a subscriber. My naïveté was so absolute that I hadn't warned Annie ahead of time."
Time has vindicated Sanford. The play got very strong reviews, won the Pulitzer, was restaged in New York and London and was named by The New York Times as among the best American plays of the last quarter century. "I wouldn't take away the learning experience," Sanford said. "I remember interviewing Edward Albee, and he said the advice he gave to writers was 'make your own mistakes."'
Sanford also presided over the demolition and rebuilding of the theater's longtime headquarters on West 42nd Street, a $ 30 million project that was completed in 2003.
"He leaves an extraordinary legacy," said Judith O. Rubin, the longtime chairman of the theater's board. "His sense of excellence is uncompromising, he's got extraordinary relationships with writers, and the soul of this place is consonant with Tim's soul."
Rubin said the board had opted not to conduct a search for a successor, but instead to promote Greenfield, who she said was an obvious and unanimous choice. She praised Greenfield for introducing a number of important new programs, and said "his aesthetic and the aesthetic of this theater are in complete sync."
Greenfield, 44, has been with Playwrights Horizons since 2007, working alongside Sanford; both men are career theater administrators who previously served as the organization's literary manager, evaluating script for potential production. The two men will jointly run the theater next season -- Greenfield will become artistic director in July 2020, and Sanford will assume the title "outgoing artistic director" until June 2021.
"I think we're in a really strong place, financially and artistically," Greenfield said. And, he added, "we live in an extraordinary moment for American playwriting."
Greenfield is married to a playwright, Jordan Harrison, several of whose works ("Marjorie Prime" and "Log Cabin," for example) have been produced by Playwrights Horizons. Greenfield said his husband's relationship with the theater predates his own, and "I don't feel complicated about continuing to program his work."
The transition takes place at a time of enormous churn at nonprofit theaters across the country, when a generation dominated by white men is being succeeded by a more diverse group of leaders.
"I know we have a lot of growth to do in terms of the diversity and equity on our stage and in our offices, and I know as a cis white gay male, I have an enormous responsibility," Greenfield said.
Asked about challenges facing the theater, he said, "New York City is a crowded marketplace, and we live in a world that moves faster, so the argument to come spend a good chunk of change to see a play does get harder the more we have more forms of entertainment readily accessible."
Also, he said, he wanted to focus on "the integrity of producing new, pioneering, exploratory, inquisitive work in a culture that seems to enjoy the shorthand and often pays attention to the loudest voice."
"I worry about the pressures that are put on nonprofits by the culture of late capitalism," he said, "to make compromises to the urgency and immediacy and purity of an artistic expression."

Texto completo: A federal appeals court's ruling on the Affordable Care Act could be a huge headache for the president and take Democrats' focus off Medicare for all.
WASHINGTON -- A federal appeals court in New Orleans is preparing a ruling on the Affordable Care Act that could put the law's future front and center in the presidential race, overwhelming the current Democratic debate over Medicare for all and reigniting the health care-driven worries that helped Democrats win back the House last year.
Three judges on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals are weighing whether to uphold a Texas judge's ruling that the law's requirement for most Americans to have health insurance is unconstitutional, and that the rest of the sprawling law cannot function without it. It is hard to imagine a thornier domestic issue for President Trump, whose administration not only refused to defend the law in the case filed by Texas and 19 other states but sided with the plaintiffs, asking the court to invalidate it.
A ruling against Barack Obama's signature domestic achievement as president, which provides health coverage for about 24 million Americans, would almost certainly be stayed pending further appeal.
But if it comes in the next few weeks, it could create significant confusion during open enrollment for the Obamacare plans offered through the law's online marketplaces. And it would open a huge vulnerability for Mr. Trump, whose health care platform largely consists of attacking as socialism Democratic plans to expand government health care, either through Medicare for all or a government-run health care option that would be offered through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces.
A ruling against the health law would probably reframe the Democratic conversation on health policy away from moving beyond the Affordable Care Act toward Republican efforts to take health care away. That message, a driving force in the 2018 midterm campaigns, could resonate more broadly than the party's current arguments over expanding coverage.
"Democrats will do better talking about what Trump can take away than about their new policy visions," said Chris Jennings, a longtime Democratic adviser on health care. "The Texas case may reframe discourse around health policy more toward that type of discussion, which of course Republicans will hate."
The law's most popular provision is protections for people with pre-existing medical conditions, but it includes much more, such as health insurance exchanges where people can buy private coverage with subsidies, an expansion of Medicaid and requirements for what insurance must cover, from emergency services to prescription drugs.
The appeals court panel could decide to partly reverse Judge Reed O'Connor of the Federal District Court in Fort Worth, affirming that the mandate that most Americans have health insurance is unconstitutional but rejecting Judge O'Connor's ruling that the rest of the law cannot stand without it. That would cause barely a ripple, because the tax penalty for not having insurance was reduced to zero in the 2017 tax overhaul and the effects have been negligible.
But a ruling that upheld his decision in full, or even one that said the mandate and pre-existing condition protections had to go, would send shock waves through the health care and political systems. Either outcome would probably play into Democratic hands, especially in contests against vulnerable Republicans like Senators Martha McSally of Arizona, Cory Gardner of Colorado, Susan Collins of Maine and Thom Tillis of North Carolina.
Republicans are not conceding that possibility. Asked how a ruling against the law might affect members of the party seeking re-election, the spokesman for the House Republican campaign arm, Chris Pack, said: "Both Democrats and Republicans oppose Obamacare. The only difference is that Democrats want to replace it with socialized single-payer health care that makes private health insurance illegal."
In fact, most Democrats would welcome a renewed debate over the Affordable Care Act. Many Democrats in Congress have resisted Medicare for all; instead they have sought to shore up the existing health law and trap Republicans on pre-existing conditions. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, intends to force a floor vote as soon as next week on a resolution to overturn a Trump rule that lets states promote skimpy-but-inexpensive insurance plans that do not meet the law's coverage standards.
The vote, Mr. Schumer said Tuesday on the Senate floor, "will present our Republican colleagues with a choice: whether to protect Americans with pre-existing conditions or not to protect them."
Mr. Trump is in a box on health care, the issue that registers as a top priority for voters in poll after poll. He wants deals on ending surprise medical bills and lowering prescription drug prices, but the Senate and House are far apart on what drug price legislation they would agree to, and impeachment proceedings could derail any chance of bipartisan measures.
Public support for the health law remains high, driven in part by swing voters. And few Americans believe Mr. Trump will offer details of a new health care plan before the end of the year, according to a Kaiser poll released this week. They also doubt any plan he releases would offer "better care at lower costs," as he has promised.
Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services, has repeatedly played down the importance of expanding coverage to the remaining uninsured; instead, he has said, Mr. Trump wants to improve the health care system for all Americans. His efforts thus far have mostly been directed at discrete groups of patients: a plan to reduce new H.I.V. infections by 75 percent over five years, for example, and another to move people with advanced kidney disease to home-based, instead of clinic-based, dialysis.
At oral arguments before the appeals court panel in July, a lawyer from the Justice Department indicated the Trump administration would seek a stay if the panel upheld Judge O'Connor's decision. The losing side could appeal directly to the Supreme Court, increasing the chances of a ruling or at least oral arguments before that court in the final months of the presidential campaign. Alternatively, it could first ask for a hearing by the full appeals court, which would slow down the process.
The appeals panel could also send the case back to Judge O'Connor to reconsider, an option that August Flentje, a lawyer for the Justice Department, embraced during oral arguments. That would also draw out the court fight.
When the six-week open enrollment period starts next month, there will be more insurers offering plans through the Affordable Care Act markets. Premiums have stabilized, too, after a few years of price increases. But it will be a much lower-profile effort than in past years; the Trump administration has cut the budget for both advertising and enrollment help. As a result, a court ruling against the law would paralyze open enrollment if people assume there is no use buying or renewing coverage under a law that was ruled unconstitutional, and if no effort is mounted to counter that misunderstanding.
"It will require a doubling down, a dramatic increase in education -- which is exactly the opposite of what this administration has done," said Leslie Dach, executive director of Protect Our Care, a consumer advocacy group aligned with Democrats. "Someone will need to educate people that low-cost, quality health insurance is still available to them."

Texto completo: KOMSILGA COMMUNE, Burkina Faso - A wave of violent attacks and suspected terrorist activity in Burkina Faso has triggered a sudden humanitarian crisis, uprooting hundreds of thousands of people from their homes in what was once one of West Africa's most tranquil nations.
In the space of just three weeks, the number of internally displaced people in Burkina Faso has increased by almost 70% to nearly half a million people, in a nation of 20 million, according to the United Nations refugee agency. About one-third of the country's territory has become engulfed in fighting between armed groups, making the area inaccessible to aid workers, UNICEF officials said.
"The attackers came into our village, they killed my husband and they left. They claimed nothing and left us with orphans," said Mariam Birba, 32, who arrived earlier this month at a roadside camp for internally displaced people, about 12 miles south of the capital, Ouagadougou.
Birba and four other residents from the village of Pissélé, less than 100 miles north of the capital, said that on the evening of Sept. 21, about 40 men wielding Kalashnikov rifles and riding motorbikes came screeching to a halt and opened fire, killing eight people.
Survivors said that they didn't know who the attackers were or where they came from, but the attackers warned the villagers that they had 48 hours to leave their homes or face more violence.
Such attacks have turned life upside down in Burkina Faso, which until recently had a reputation for its calm, its bustling art scene and its music culture, a contrast to neighboring countries like Mali and Niger, which have been rocked by terrorism and violence in recent years.
The crisis has overwhelmed the local authorities and international aid workers in the small, landlocked nation, where even in more peaceful times, 45% of the population lived on less than $1.25 per day. In response to the emergency, only one-third of the requested $187 million in international aid has been fulfilled, according to the United Nations.
While terrorist groups like the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara and Ansaroul Islam are active in the north of Burkina Faso, much of the violence carried out in the country has gone unclaimed. Experts say that personal disputes, ethnic tensions or inter-communal conflicts are often behind the attacks - and not terrorist activity.
"Many of the attacks in Burkina Faso are rarely claimed by terrorist groups. We are, therefore, entitled to ask ourselves who officially is behind terrorist acts," said Jacob Yarabatioula, a researcher specializing in terrorism at the University of Ouagadougou. "Attacks tend to be linked to community conflicts or settling scores."
Several military outposts in the northern Sahel region have been abandoned after being attacked by armed men, according to two government officials and an international security adviser.
The violence has been moving south, from the border with Mali, toward the city of Kaya, which is about 60 miles northeast of the capital.
Most embassies in the country now advise their citizens not to leave the capital. Meanwhile, life in Ouagadougou goes on seamlessly - Muslims attend evening prayers, Christians go to church on Sundays and the city's young people sip on cold Brakina beers at popular restaurants late into the night. But that sense of normality is slowly being eroded by a foreboding feeling of crisis edging toward the capital.
Between Aug. 6 and Sept. 30 of this year, at least 26 military personnel from Burkina Faso's armed forces were killed and 25 were injured in attacks, according to figures compiled by international organizations working in the country.
On Friday, at least 15 people were killed when gunmen attacked a mosque in Oudalan province, close to the border with Mali, a local security official confirmed.

Texto completo: Headnote CHICAGO TEACHERS' STRIKE
CHICAGO - Tens of thousands of public school teachers joined picket lines Thursday as a strike in the nation's Third-largest school district canceled classes across Chicago and left its new mayor, Lori Lightfoot, grappling with her most significant crisis to date.
For the families of Chicago's more than 300,000 public school students, the walkout set off a chaotic scramble to find child care. City officials said that schools remained open, and that students would be fed three meals and be supervised by nonunion workers like principals. But attendance at some schools around the city appeared light and school bus service was suspended.
Parents said they were concerned about whether there would be enough supervision or activities at the schools. Many of them stayed home from work, hired babysitters or relatives, or signed up for "strike camps" that were hastily arranged at local sports facilities and community centers, where children played hangman and Una on Thursday.
The standoff between city officials and more than 20,000 Chicago teachers and thousands more school support workers had been brewing for months. Officials from the city and the union continued closed-door negotiations Thursday, even as a crush of teachers held a major rally through Chicago's downtown business district in the afternoon.
The strike in Chicago follows a wave of teacher protests and work stoppages nationwide, including in conservat ve states like West Virginia and Oklahoma, as well as in large, liberal cities including Los Angeles and Denver.
Across the country teachers' unions have demanded bigger budgets for both salaries and classroom supplies, smaller class sizes and additional support personnel, such as nurses and guidance counselors - the issues at the heart of the current conflict in Chicago.
Along the protest lines Thursday, teachers stressed that their biggest complaints were not about their own salaries, but concerns about equity for all of the city's public school students, including those on the West and South Sides, where schools have been closed in recent years.
Many parents voiced support for teachers - a Chicago Sun-Times survey conducted before the walkout suggested that nearly half of Chicago voters surveyed said they would support a strike - though some said tney were scrambling to come up with alternative arrangements for their families, and worried about how long this might go on. They weighed what it would mean for college applications, for sports seasons, for daily routines.
On the city's Far North Side, Eric Ndedi, the father of two boys - ages 14 and 9 - said he had kept his children home with their mother even though school buildings were open.
"It's more safe than going when there is no teacher," said Ndedi, 42, a ride-hailing driver who said he had been accustomed to teachers' strikes while growing up in the Democratic Republic of Congo, but had not previously experienced one in the United States. "It's better to stay at home."
The strike is the first for Chicago's school system since 2012, when teachers walked out for seven days. The union also held a planned, one-day walkout in 2016 to draw attention to contract negotiations and the district's fiscal woes.
Jesse Sharkey, president of the Chicago Teachers Union, has said that he hoped for a short strike and saw a path for an agreement, but that the ball was now in Lightfoot's court.
"It's up to the mayor to get a fast contract settlement; she has the power to do that," Sharkey said outside Peirce International Studies School on the North Side on Thursday morning. "But we are going to hold fast to a just contract settlement."
Lightfoot cautioned parents that classes had been canceled indefinitely, though she also told reporters that an agreement might quickly be worked out.

Texto completo: NEW YORK - Lizzo's breakthrough tune, "Truth Hurts," which spent six weeks on top of Billboard's Hot 100 chart this year, features the signature line:"I just took a DNA test/ Turns out I'm 100 percent that b----." The lyric originated from a 2017 tweet by singer Mina Lioness and was turned into a meme, which was then used in Lizzo's song "Healthy," created in 2017.
The songwriting brothers Justin and Jeremiah Raisen, who worked on "Healthy," claim say they deserve writing credit on "Truth Hurts" since the song borrows from "Healthy," a tune they co-wrote.
The songwriters credited on "Truth Hurts" are Lizzo, Ricky Reed, Tele and Jesse Saint John. "Truth Hurts" was originally released in September 2017 but got a boost this year after it was featured in the Netflix film "Someone Great."
"After reaching out to Ricky Reed and Lizzo's team about fixing it, we put the song in dispute in 2017 when it came out," Justin Raisen wrote Tuesday on Instagram. "We've tried to sort this out quietly for the last two years ... but were shut down every time."
Lizzo's lawyer Cynthia Arato said in a statement: "They did not collaborate with Lizzo or anyone else to create this song, and they did not help write any of the material that they now seek to profit from, which is why they expressly renounced any claim to the work, in writing, months ago."
The New York Times reported that the Raisens rescinded an earlier claim over "Truth Hurts" through their publisher, Kobalt.
"The last thing we want to do is throw any negativity toward Lizzo's momentum and movement as a cultural figure. If we believe in what she's preaching, believing in ourselves & our own voices is something we thought she'd understand," Justin Raisen wrote.

Ousted: Country music star Gretchen Wilson, whose hit song, "Here for the Party," features the lyrics, "And I ain't leaving till they throw me out," was ousted from a New Mexico hotel last weekend over noise complaints. A Las Cruces police spokesman said Wilson, 46, and other guests had "worn out their welcome" at the Hotel Encanto de Las Cruces and they helped security remove them. The musician tweeted the hotel asked her to leave "in the middle of the night for no reason." She also called on Twitter followers to "band together to put Hotel Encanto out of business."
Podcastland: TV powerhouse Shonda Rhimes ("Grey's Anatomy," "Scandal") is moving aggressively into the burgeoning podcast world, inking a three-year deal between her company, Shondaland, and iHeartMedia. In a statement, Rhimes said she welcomed the opportunity to expand Shondaland's storytelling into the growing medium, which she praised for a unique sense of boldness and intimacy.
Homicide update: "Tarzan" actor Ron Ely's wife, Valerie Lundeen Ely, 62, was stabbed to death in their California home by their 30-year-old son, Cameron Ely, who was then shot and killed by sheriff's deputies, authorities said. Ron Ely, 81, played the title character on the NBC series "Tarzan" from 1966 to 1968.

‘Embodiment of corruption’: Tulsi Gabbard lashes Hillary Clinton over Russian asset claim

Texto completo: Tulsi Gabbard responded to Hillary Clinton's assertion that Russia is behind a plan to turn the Hawaii congresswoman into a spoiler candidate by calling the former secretary of state the "queen of warmongers" and invited her to join the 2020 Democratic presidential race.
"Great! Thank you @HillaryClinton. You, the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long, have finally come out from behind the curtain," Gabbard said in a tweet on Friday.
"From the day I announced my candidacy, there has been a concerted campaign to destroy my reputation," Gabbard continued. "We wondered who was behind it and why. Now we know — it was always you, through your proxies and powerful allies in the corporate media and war machine, afraid of the threat I pose. It’s now clear that this primary is between you and me. Don’t cowardly hide behind your proxies. Join the race directly."
Tweet Tweet
A spokesman for Clinton responded to Gabbard's tweets with a quip referencing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who Gabbard met with in 2017.
"Assad day for your candidacy," he tweeted.
Clinton suggested in a podcast released Friday that Russia is grooming Gabbard to be a third-party spoiler candidate in 2020, aiding President Trump's reelection.
"They are also going to do third party again," said Clinton, the unsuccessful Democratic nominee against President Trump in 2016. "I'm not making any predictions, but I think they’ve got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate," Clinton said. A Clinton representative later confirmed that she was referring to Gabbard.
"She is a favorite of the Russians. They have a bunch of sites and bots and ways of supporting her so far. That's assuming Jill Stein will give it up, which she might not because she is also a Russian asset," Clinton said. "They know they can't win without a third-party candidate, and so I do not know who it is going to be, but I can guarantee you they will have a vigorous third-party challenge in the key states that they most need it."

Gabbard said in August that she would not run for president as an independent if she does not win the Democratic presidential nomination.
In 2016, Gabbard resigned as the Democratic National Committee's vice charwoman so she could endorse Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders over Clinton in the 2016 Democratic presidential primary.
In addition to being a Hawaii congresswoman, Gabbard is a major in the Hawaii Army National Guard. In 2004, she deployed to Iraq and served as a specialist with a medical company at Camp Anaconda. In 2008 and 2009, she deployed to Kuwait as an Army military police officer and was the primary trainer for the Kuwait National Guard. In August, she took a two-week break from campaigning to complete Army National Guard training in Indonesia.
Accusations of being sympathetic to Russia or being propped up by Russian bots and attention have dogged Gabbard throughout her campaign. During a Democratic presidential primary debate on Tuesday, Gabbard condemned CNN and the New York Times for spreading the accusations. "Just two days ago, the New York Times put out an article saying that I'm a Russian asset and an Assad apologist and all these different smears. This morning, a CNN commentator said on national television that I'm an asset of Russia. Completely despicable," she said.

Lowell Spinners would lose Red Sox connection under radical MLB plan

Texto completo: The nearly 25-year affiliation between the Lowell Spinners and the Red Sox would end under a radical reorganization proposal from Major League Baseball which leaked Friday, one that would shrink the number of affiliated minor league teams by 25 percent.
Short-season leagues, including the New York-Penn League in which Lowell plays, would be disbanded under the plan, which would eliminate 42 affiliated teams in total. Because MLB views Lowell and the Spinners' home, Edward A. LeLacheur Park, as “good," the franchise would continue to exist in the “Dream League," an MLB concept in line with independent or college leagues.
Also dropping to the Dream League would be the two other New England teams in the NYPL: The Vermont Lake Monsters, affiliated with Oakland since 2011 and playing at 113-year-old Centennial Field in Burlington since the franchise formed in 1994, and the (Norwich) Connecticut Tigers.
The overhaul, first reported by Baseball America and the New York Times, has emerged from ongoing and now contentious negotiations between MLB and Minor League Baseball over their Professional Baseball Agreement, which will expire on Sept. 30, 2020.
MLB says the primary motivations for the changes, which emerged from the MLB owners' meetings in June and were presented to MiLB in August, are to ensure its young players play in quality facilities — rather than some of the current dilapidated stadiums, mostly found in the lower leagues — and to create a saner geographic layout for both leagues and MLB franchises.
The cuts would serve to motivate MLB to increase the currently meager salaries it pays minor leaguers, an increasingly plaguing issue.
Minor League Baseball does not accept the premise and the impetus for the proposals.
“We are engaged in negotiations, and while both sides have differing views over what's going on, we hope that there's a resolution available, but we are concerned about saving baseball in as many cities in America as we can, and the proposal that's on the table at this point doesn't give us any comfort that that's even possible," said Pat O'Conner, president and CEO of Minor League Baseball, which oversees the current 16-league, 160-team system. “It's the economics. These ownership groups in these communities are just not going to be able to withstand the additional costs the MLB proposal puts on them."
Through other channels, MiLB castigated MLB for seeking cuts after boasting recently about increased minor-league attendance in the face of decreases in the major leagues. In addition, MiLB intimated that the plan could create a feeling of betrayal among members of the US Congress who, besides holding antitrust authority over MLB, are also invested in maintaining baseball's prosperity at all levels.
Dave Heller, owner of the Lowell Spinners and three other affiliated teams, was not immediately available for comment. The Red Sox referred the matter to MLB for elaboration; MLB declined to comment.
The “120 plan" wants to reduce the total number of teams from 160 to 120 and eliminate short-season leagues. It also addresses geographical gerrymandering in places like the Triple A Pacific Coast League, whose 16 teams are spread out from Nashville and Memphis in Tennessee to Tacoma, Wash., and Sacramento, Calif.
Each big-league franchise would be limited to four US based full-season franchises, plus one complex-based Rookie-league team.
No other teams in the Red Sox system — Pawtucket/Worcester (Triple A), Portland, Maine (Double A); Salem, Va. (High A); Greenville, S.C. (Single A); and its Gulf Coast squad (Rookie) in Fort Myers, Fla. — would be eliminated or moved out of their league, although there is a high probability that the Single A Carolina and South Atlantic Leagues will be rejiggered and/or drastically reduced.
The “120 plan" calls for a cap on total players under minor-league contract, somewhere between 150–200 per franchise, according to an industry source. (Dominican Summer League teams and roster sizes would not be affected.) Including Lowell, the Red Sox have space for 190 minor-league contracts in their system.
Roster sizes of teams would also be altered. With an emphasis on health and wellness for its players closest to being called up, MLB wants to increase the roster size in Double and Triple A up from 25, which would allow for more player off days, the ability to carry an additional catcher, reduce workloads on pitchers, and effectively create a more serviceable taxi squad.
Also, the “120 plan" seeks to push back the date of the amateur draft from early June to later in the month, after the conclusion of the College World Series.

Texto completo: As more aspects of daily life and business become connected through the Internet, and as cities and towns increasingly find themselves the targets of cyberattacks, the Baker administration announced Thursday a new effort to help each of the state's 351 cities and towns bolster their cybersecurity readiness.
The effort will be backed by $300,000 in funding managed by the MassCyberCenter at the MassTech Collaborative, which plans to host a series of statewide workshops at which communities can get assistance developing or reviewing their cyber incident response plans and can collaborate with neighboring communities.
Speaking at the Massachusetts Cybersecurity Forum, Governor Charlie Baker said it is critical that state and local governments and the private sector make cybersecurity part of everything they do in an increasingly technological world.
“Most people, when they think about cybersecurity, think it's primarily or exclusively about your phone and your laptop and your iPad and all the rest. But as we digitize more and more of our other building infrastructure — our heating systems, our cooling systems, our ventilation systems — those become, for all intents and purposes, targets," he said. “And one of the things that we in state and local government need to do as well as our colleagues in the private sector need to do is make sure that as we digitize and electrify a lot of these processes that have typically been mechanical that we're doing the work we need to do to ensure that they're secure, because they can be attacked."
Baker has pushed information technology to the forefront of state government in recent years by creating the new Cabinet-level Executive Office of Technology Services and Security, led by Curtis Wood, and pushing for the creation of the MassCyberCenter last year to bolster the state's cybersecurity readiness and to promote the cybersecurity economy.
In April, Baker filed a $1.15 billion IT bond bill authorizing funds for information technology, public safety equipment, and cybersecurity projects. His administration has touted the importance of that bill, and the need for its swift passage, at two committee hearings since then.
“Every day, we have attacks. Just to give you a frame of reference, we have implemented new technology in the state where we are kind of able to analyze everything that comes into the state network, and I will say, as of today, on a daily basis we receive about 525 million probes a day from foreign soil," Wood told lawmakers three weeks ago. “They're pinging our network, they're scanning our Commonwealth network trying to find a vulnerability."
On Thursday, Baker said he hopes the Legislature passes the bond bill before leaving Beacon Hill for their next recess, which runs from Thanksgiving through the holiday season and into 2020.
“Our hope on that one is that it could come up before the end of the calendar year. They've had hearings on parts of it, which is great, but obviously bond bills have a history of getting dealt with toward the end of the session," he told reporters. “I think our view on it is it'd be great if it got done by the end of the calendar year but it would be necessary to get it done by the end of the session."
The borrowing bill would authorize $600 million in spending on information technology infrastructure that the administration said would “help fortify the Commonwealth's defenses and against cyberattacks" and improve residents' ability to interact digitally with government, including for health care, housing, and other services. Among the projects to be funded is a new $135 million “Security Operations Center."
Senate President Karen Spilka, who also spoke at the cybersecurity forum, noted that The New York Times recently reported that more than 40 cities and towns across America have been victims of cyberattacks so far this year.
“It's a problem right here in Massachusetts, too. Our communities and businesses face a barrage of attempted ransomware attacks, hacks, and data breaches daily," she said. “So it's not an exaggeration when I say that we're under siege and we need to be resilient and ready at all times. That means making sure that the vibrant state economy that we have has all the best minds and is in the best position to thwart these attacks."
Last month, New Bedford Mayor Jon Mitchell detailed for the Local Government Advisory Committee an incident over the summer in which a cybercriminal hit New Bedford's computer system with a virus that essentially locked the city's data and files away and prevented city officials from accessing it. The cybercriminal offered the city a key to decrypt the files, but only if New Bedford would pay a $5.3 million ransom.
“We're in an arms race with the bad guys out there, most of whom operate well outside the reach of federal law enforcement," Mitchell said, offering a cautionary tale for the local officials gathered around the table.

Texto completo: Johnson & Johnson, facing potentially costly litigation over opioids and baby powder, has agreed to pay $ 117 million to settle claims brought by dozens of states that said it deceptively marketed transvaginal pelvic mesh implants.
The settlement with attorneys general from 41 states and the District of Columbia was announced Thursday.
Pelvic mesh products have been at the heart of roughly $ 8 billion in personal-injury settlements between several manufacturers and tens of thousands of women in the United States.
This year, the Food and Drug Administration, after years of complaints, stopped the sale of pelvic mesh to treat a condition called organ prolapse. Johnson & Johnson had stopped selling pelvic mesh to treat that condition in 2012, but it and other manufacturers still sell similar products to treat urinary incontinence in women.
Women have complained about intense pain and bleeding after receiving mesh implants. In some cases, women have had additional surgery to remove the implants -- a procedure that can be fraught with its own problems.
In a statement, Johnson & Johnson said the settlement, which also covers its subsidiary Ethicon, was not an admission of liability or misconduct. Attorneys general from states including Florida, Texas and Ohio led the negotiations.
"Women in Indiana and across the country have suffered as a result of the actions of Johnson & Johnson and Ethicon Inc.," Curtis Hill, the Indiana attorney general, said in a statement. His state will receive $ 4.4 million under the agreement.
The settlement does not include California, which took Johnson & Johnson to court this summer. That state is seeking up to $ 800 million in damages over claims that Johnson & Johnson deceived tens of thousands of women and doctors about the benefits of pelvic mesh to treat both organ prolapse and incontinence. Testimony concluded last month, but the judge has not yet ruled.
Shares of Johnson & Johnson have come under pressure this year from the mounting costs of litigation.
In August, a judge ordered the company to pay $ 572 million (later reduced by $ 107 million because of a miscalculation) to Oklahoma after finding that Johnson & Johnson intentionally played down the dangers of opioids while it oversold their benefits. Last week, a Philadelphia jury awarded $ 8 billion in punitive damages to a Maryland man who said he hadn't been warned that the antipsychotic drug Risperdal could cause enlarged breasts in boys. About 10,000 others have raised similar claims.
The company planned to challenge those rulings.
Johnson & Johnson has had mixed results defending itself against lawsuits that claimed the talc in its baby powder was contaminated with cancer-causing asbestos. Internal company documents reviewed by The New York Times indicate that the company knew there were concerns about asbestos contamination in talc for decades, but did not warn customers.

It was a long, blistering summer, but many of us will soon be turning the heat back on. That means a lot of greenhouse gas emissions.
In the United States, heating homes and businesses produces about 560 million tons of carbon dioxide per year, or about a 10th of the country's emissions. But there's something that might drastically cut down on both your heating bills and your carbon footprint, no matter where you live: a heat pump.
A heat pump is an all-in-one heating and cooling unit. There are a few different kinds, but the most common ones extract warmth from the air. Then, they move it inside (to heat the home) or outside (for cooling). That requires a lot less energy than traditional heating systems -- like boilers, furnaces and electric radiators -- that work by warming up the air inside your house.
"There's a fair amount of heat even in the cold air," said Vijay Modi, a professor of mechanical engineering at Columbia University. He estimated that a home heat pump could cut electricity use by as much as two-thirds compared with more traditional heating systems.
The Northeast Energy Efficiency Partnerships, a nonprofit group focused on energy efficiency, found that replacing a traditional indoor heating system with a heat pump could save as much as $ 948 a year.
But switching to a heat pump also requires a significant investment, often thousands of dollars. That's why Dr. Modi recommended making the switch when it's time to replace to your old heating and air-conditioning system.
Much of that upfront investment will be installation costs, but many states offer rebates to help offset that expense. The Database of State Incentives for Renewables and Efficiency is one place to search for programs in your area. Manufacturers and local contractors should be good sources of up-to-date information as well.
It's also possible to get a heat pump in an apartment or in just a few rooms of your house, even if your place doesn't have air ducts. In that case, you could go with window-mounted units or, more likely, a split-unit system, where the heat pump compressor is mounted on your roof or balcony, with lines that run heat into the house.
It's worth noting, however, that heat pumps become less efficient as the temperature drops.
"In extremely cold temperatures they will not operate as efficiently," said Eileen Wysocki, an administrator at Holy Cross Energy, a rural electric utility in Colorado. She said heat pumps optimized for cold climates normally operate at 100 percent efficiency all the way down to 0 degrees Fahrenheit, or minus 18 Celsius, and at 80 percent efficiency down to minus 13 Fahrenheit. They generally shut down when the mercury sinks to minus 18 Fahrenheit.
So, if you live in a place that frequently experiences deep freezes, you'll probably want to keep a traditional heating system in place alongside your heat pump.
The precise gains from a heat pump will depend on a variety of factors like your insulation, your electricity source and local energy rates. But, Dr. Modi said, the share of people installing them is rising quickly.
"To me, it's a no-brainer," he said.

Transportation is the largest source of planet-warming greenhouse gases in the United States today, and the bulk of those emissions comes from our cars and trucks.
Last week, we published a detailed map of driving-related emissions, showing the otherwise invisible trails of carbon dioxide along America's roads. The project, based on new data from Boston University, allows you to see carbon dioxide emissions from passenger and freight traffic across the country and in your own area.
Nationally, driving-related emissions have been on the rise in recent years, despite federal and state efforts to bring them down. Boston University's data reveals that much of that growth has occurred in and around America's cities.
Using the university's local estimates, we identified the 100 metropolitan areas with the highest total emissions from driving and found that CO₂ is increasing both in total and per person in nearly every metro region. (Even the denser areas with big public transit networks, like New York City, have seen automotive emissions per resident tick up in recent years.)
But here's a bit of good news: More and more cities are looking to drive down these stubborn emissions as part of broader local efforts to avert the worst effects of climate change. And, our project was picked up by local news outlets around the country, including in Dallas, Des Moines, Boston, Tampa and Seattle. So, while emissions are rising, at least we know awareness is growing, too.

We got tons of email in response to our item last week about children and climate anxiety. One of the most thoughtful messages was from Nirali Shah of Redmond, Wash. She had additional suggestions about kids and climate change. Here they are, lightly edited and condensed for space:
Start young -- If you talk about sustainable living early, it becomes a part of how children live. That eliminates the need for behavioral changes. With smaller children, you don't need to explain why the environment is important.
Connect with nature -- Help your kids develop an emotional connection with nature at a young age. Talk about local plants and animals. We hear about the importance of having children empathize with other people, but extend that to nature by taking care of plants, discussing how animals live and picking up litter. If they have that connection, they're more likely to become the environmental stewards of tomorrow.
Talk about science -- Show your own respect for science. Read and discuss space, explorers, weather and more. Encourage young people to ask questions and look up information together. Talk about how to identify valid sources.
Thanks, Nirali! And have a great week.

Texto completo: The most powerful office in the world is occupied - and being abused - by a man who is entirely unfit and is spinning dangerously out of control. Everyone needs to stop pretending otherwise.
And it's all getting worse.
President Trump's train wreck of a performance on Wednesday, at a meeting with congressional leaders, represented a new low on a scale that seems to have no bottom. "I pray for the president all the time . . . I think now, we have to pray for his health," House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said later, because "this was a very serious meltdown on the part of the president."
Trump began by complaining about having to attend a meeting initiated by his own White House aides, according to published accounts. The subject was Trump's sudden decision to move U.S. military personnel in Syria aside, allowing Turkish troops and affiliated militias to sweep across the border and attack the Kurds, who had been loyal U.S. allies.
The president then tried to make the case that he did not actually condone the Turkish invasion. Attendees were given copies of a truly bizarre and alarming letter Trump had sent to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Oct. 9. Just four short paragraphs long, the letter begins, "Let's work out a good deal!" It ends by telling Erdogan, "History will look upon you favorably if you get this done the right and humane way. It will look upon you forever as the devil if good things don't happen. Don't be a tough guy. Don't be a fool! I will call you later."
That is how the president of the United States communicated with a powerful foreign leader at a moment of crisis. We have all witnessed more sophisticated attempts at persuasion on kindergarten playgrounds. Erdogan reportedly threw the letter in the trash.
During the White House meeting, Trump went on to denigrate Jim Mattis, the decorated and highly esteemed Marine Corps general who served as Trump's defense secretary before resigning last year over Syria policy. Mattis is "the world's most overrated general," Trump announced, according to the New York Times. "You know why? He wasn't tough enough. I captured ISIS. Mattis said it would take two years. I captured them in one month."
Anyone in touch with reality knows that none of this is true. The territory held by ISIS - the Islamic State - was reclaimed by Kurdish fighters with the aid and guidance of U.S. troops and intelligence operatives. Shortly before the meeting, the House voted 354 to 60 to condemn Trump's abandonment of the Kurds, with most Republicans joining their Democratic colleagues in expressing outrage.
Perhaps that vote was what set Trump off. "You're just a politician," he told Pelosi. Then he amended his assessment: "You're not a politician, you're a third-rate politician."
That's what Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) heard; Pelosi thought she heard him say "third-grade politician." In any event, she and House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) rose to their feet and walked out.
They pressed Trump and his aides to explain what the plan was for fighting the Islamic State now that the Kurdish firewall is gone. They didn't get an answer because there is no plan. The president doesn't have the foggiest idea what he is doing.
Trump is in so far over his head that he doesn't know which way is up. He also is intellectually, psychologically and morally unsuitable for the high office he holds. Those two problems - incompetence and unfitness - reinforce one another in the worst possible way, and have sent the presidency into a tailspin that puts the nation and the world in mounting peril.
Impeachment is no longer optional, given what we already know about Trump's dealings with Ukraine. But the prospect of facing a Senate trial - for which Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is already making plans - can only boost Trump's anxiety. His outbursts and tweetstorms are becoming more frequent and less tethered to the world of facts, events and consequences. Madness is a term laypeople use, not doctors. We must use it now.
I once was confident that our institutions and processes were durable enough to easily survive Trump. Now, I'm less sure. "Don't be a tough guy. Don't be a fool!" - a letter saying these things, on behalf of the United States government, was actually sent to the government of Turkey. Good Lord.
Senators, pay attention. You may prefer to let voters judge Trump in next year's election. But you must realize, at this point, that we may not have that long.

Texto completo: Un hombre sin hogar atravesaba un vecindario industrial en el centro de Oklahoma City el 12 de agosto cuando la policía lo vio. Pasaba de las 10 p.m. y los oficiales observaron que el desaliñado hombre sin camisa y una mochila al hombro no tenía luces traseras en su bicicleta.
Cuando intentaron detenerlo, Cody Gregg aceleró más para luego tirar la bicicleta unas cuadras adelante e intentar huir a pie. Los policías lo alcanzaron e inspeccionaron su mochila. Dentro encontraron un sospechoso polvo blanco en una lata de café, según documentos judiciales consultados por el diario The Oklahoman.
“Dentro del bolso había una gran cantidad de substancia blanca en polvo que basado en mi experiencia y mi entrenamiento creí que se trataba de cocaína”, dijo el oficial que hizo la revisión, según el diario citado. “Más tarde, el polvo blanco dentro del bolso dio resultado positivo para cocaína y era un paquete que pesaba en total 45.91 gramos de cocaína”, añadió.
Gregg fue acusado de posesión de cocaína con intención de distribución y fue enviado a la cárcel del condado de Oklahoma mientras aguardaba su juicio. Él se declaró inocente. Pero la semana pasada, tras dos meses, su arresto fue en agosto, se cansó de esperar y se declaró culpable. Fue sentenciado a 15 años en prisión.
La cárcel del condado de Oklahoma ha estado plagada de problemas durante años, como goteras, moho, sobrepoblación y una tasa de suicidios y muertes mayor a la del promedio nacional, según The Oklahoman.
El jueves pasado, sólo dos días después de recibir su prolongada sentencia, resultados de laboratorio demostraron que el polvo blanco no era cocaína, sino leche en polvo. Gregg le dijo al juez que había conseguido la leche de un dispensario de alimentos, según el diario citado.
Al día siguiente, Gregg solicitó a la corte que le permitieran retirar su declaración de culpabilidad, a la luz de la nueva evidencia. El juez de distrito Timothy R. Henderson concedió su petición y además desechó los cargos en su contra.
Gregg estaba bajo libertad condicional al momento de su arresto. Según documentos de la corte consultados por el diario The Washington Post, había sido arrestado por cargos relacionados con narcóticos al menos unas tres veces desde 2014.
El viernes salió en libertad.
El Washington Post reporta que no es la primera vez que un resultado de laboratorio equivocado termina en la convicción de una persona inocente. Las pruebas químicas que utilizan las policías alrededor de todo el país para determinar si una substancia es ilícita fallan frecuentemente.
En 2016, una investigación del diario The New York Times y la organización de periodistas sin fines de lucro ProPublica, revelaron que hay miles de personas en la cárcel por pruebas que tienen un amplio margen de error.
Una lista de los artículos que han dado un falso positivo a cocaína, recogida por el Washington Post, incluyó cosas como galletas de chocolate, el glaseado de una dona Krispy Cream y tabletas de menta. Algunos estudios citados por este diario indican que un quinto o hasta un tercio de las pruebas están erradas. Sin embargo, las policías las siguen utilizando como una herramienta cotidiana.
La historia de Gregg ilustra otro problema: muchas personas prefieren declararse culpables para no tener que esperar meses o incluso años para tener un juicio. Más de la mitad de las personas acusadas de delitos de drogas con base en una prueba de laboratorio errada se declararon culpables a la primera oportunidad, según el estudio del New York Times y ProPublica.

State helping towns bolster cyber defenses

Texto completo: As more aspects of daily life and business become connected through the Internet, and as cities and towns increasingly find themselves the targets of cyberattacks, the Baker administration announced Thursday a new effort to help each of the state's 351 municipalities bolster their cybersecurity readiness.
The effort will be backed by $300,000 in funding managed by the MassCyberCenter at the MassTech Collaborative, which plans to host a series of statewide workshops at which communities can get assistance developing or reviewing their cyber incident response plans and can collaborate with neighboring municipalities.
Speaking at the Massachusetts Cybersecurity Forum, Governor Charlie Baker said it is critical that state and local governments and the private sector make cybersecurity part of everything they do in an increasingly technological world.
“Most people, when they think about cybersecurity, think it's primarily or exclusively about your phone and your laptop and your iPad and all the rest. But as we digitize more and more of our other building infrastructure — our heating systems, our cooling systems, our ventilation systems — those become, for all intents and purposes, targets," he said. “And one of the things that we in state and local government need to do as well as our colleagues in the private sector need to do is make sure that as we digitize and electrify a lot of these processes that have typically been mechanical that we're doing the work we need to do to ensure that they're secure, because they can be attacked."
Baker has pushed information technology to the forefront of state government in recent years by creating the new Cabinet-level Executive Office of Technology Services and Security, led by Curtis Wood, and pushing for the creation of the MassCyberCenter last year to bolster the state's cybersecurity readiness and to promote the cybersecurity economy.
In April, Baker filed a $1.15 billion IT bond bill authorizing funds for information technology, public safety equipment, and cybersecurity projects. His administration has touted the importance of that bill, and the need for its swift passage, at two committee hearings since then.
“Every day, we have attacks. Just to give you a frame of reference, we have implemented new technology in the state where we are kind of able to analyze everything that comes into the state network, and I will say, as of today, on a daily basis we receive about 525 million probes a day from foreign soil," Wood told lawmakers three weeks ago. “They're pinging our network, they're scanning our Commonwealth network trying to find a vulnerability."
On Thursday, Baker said he hopes the Legislature passes the bond bill before leaving Beacon Hill for its next recess, which runs from Thanksgiving through the holiday season and into 2020.
“Our hope on that one is that it could come up before the end of the calendar year. They've had hearings on parts of it, which is great, but obviously bond bills have a history of getting dealt with toward the end of the session," he told reporters. “I think our view on it is it'd be great if it got done by the end of the calendar year but it would be necessary to get it done by the end of the session."
The borrowing bill would authorize $600 million in spending on information technology infrastructure that the administration said would “help fortify the Commonwealth's defenses and against cyberattacks" and improve residents' ability to interact digitally with government, including for health care, housing, and other services. Among the projects to be funded is a new $135 million “Security Operations Center."
Senate President Karen Spilka, who also spoke at the cybersecurity forum, noted that The New York Times recently reported that more than 40 cities and towns across America have been victims of cyberattacks so far this year.
“It's a problem right here in Massachusetts, too. Our communities and businesses face a barrage of attempted ransomware attacks, hacks, and data breaches daily," she said. “So it's not an exaggeration when I say that we're under siege and we need to be resilient and ready at all times. That means making sure that the vibrant state economy that we have has all the best minds and is in the best position to thwart these attacks."
Last month, New Bedford Mayor Jon Mitchell detailed for the Local Government Advisory Committee an incident over the summer in which a cybercriminal hit New Bedford's computer system with a virus that essentially locked the city's data and files away and prevented city officials from accessing it. The cybercriminal offered the city a key to decrypt the files, but only if New Bedford would pay a $5.3 million ransom.
“We're in an arms race with the bad guys out there, most of whom operate well outside the reach of federal law enforcement," Mitchell said, offering a cautionary tale for the local officials gathered around the table.

'It's Always Sunny' has dodged cancel culture

Texto completo: Fans of the deeply irreverent "It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia" probably never expected to hear the show mentioned in the same breath as the 1950s values-ridden family sitcom "The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet" -- unless it was to contrast the two. Charlie Day, one of the co-creators of "It's Always Sunny," certainly didn't.
But the two now share a unique distinction.
With the recent premiere of the FX show's 14th season, they share the record for being the longest running live-action sitcom, a fact Day dubbed a "dinner conversation statistic of pride" during an interview with the Washington Post.
The show's origin story has become something of Hollywood lore. Frustrated with their struggles to break into the acting world, a group of out-of-work actors decided to shoot their own material. Rob McElhenney, one of the stars and co-creators, started with a darkly comic scenario that he originally envisioned as a short film about a guy who "came over to another friend's house to get sugar, and the friend tells him he has cancer, and all the guy can think about is getting his sugar and getting out of there," he told The New York Times in 2007.
With no budget to speak of, they used their own equipment and shot in their own apartments until -- next thing you know -- FX picked up the show, about a cranky group of friends running an Irish bar in south Philly, and added Kaitlin Olson to the cast along with McElhenney, Day and their co-creator Glenn Howerton.
Critics and a certain cult following loved the first season, but it wasn't picking up the steam it required. FX execs suggested that adding a bigger star to the cast of unknowns might gin up some more attention for the show -- and made it clear this wasn't a choice, the co-creators have said. It turned out Danny DeVito, a 30-year veteran of the big screen and an Emmy winner for "Taxi," had become a fan of the show. He joined the second season and has been with the show since.
From the jump, the show was built around these narcissistic crew of sociopaths -- calling them friends doesn't feel right, since friends generally don't try to constantly con one another -- and it's never really lightened its tone.
But while its quips about serial killing, child molestation, abortion and you-name-it might explain why it's never been nominated for a major Emmy, it did earn a steady audience.
"We don't have a lot of hardware accolades to brag about," Day said. "So I guess we can brag about statistics.
"I honestly don't have a clue why it's lasted this long," he added. "We've always been a bit of a counterculture show. We started out as the anti-sitcom. There's going to be nothing warm and fuzzy about this show, and we're gonna go right for the jugular. ... I think there's always going to be an audience for that kind of a show."
The business of actually making the show hasn't changed much in that time. The writing process, for example, remains "pretty much the same at the end of the day. It's usually Rob and I in a room, or (writers) David Hornsby and Megan Ganz in a room, and we just keep banging our heads against a wall until we have something that works."
Perhaps the show's most impressive feat is how it hasn't fallen prey to #cancelculture.
"I think the reason we came out unscathed is we're sort of grandfathered into some bad behavior," Day said. "If we, all of a sudden, launched the show this season and we're saying and doing the things we do, people might be a little more skittish about it."

But he may be best known for a song that peaked at No. 2, the double-platinum "Honky Tonk Badonkadonk," a song he wisely held off for his closing song of his crowd-pleasing set at this year's Country Thunder Arizona, where Brett Eldredge praised him as "one of the best country singers on this Earth."

Here to Help; What New Parents Should Consider About Taxes

Texto completo: Middle-income married couples spend roughly $ 233,000 to raise a child from birth to age 17. Families are entitled to certain tax benefits to help cushion this financial blow, but the trick is to take full advantage of them. Here's how you can conquer the tax scaries, either this enrollment period at work or during a special enrollment period after childbirth. Taylor Tepper
UPDATE YOUR W-4 AND FILING STATUS. Because you've added a new person to your household, you most likely owe less in taxes than you did before. But if you don't change your allowances on your W-4 -- that tax form most people fill out as quickly as they can, with as minimal thought as possible, when they start a new job -- you may end up overpaying your taxes throughout the year. If you're married, you and your partner should select Married filing jointly as your tax filing status, which generally means you qualify for more tax credits. If you're a single parent who meets the qualifications, you should consider updating your tax filing status from Single to Head of household on Form 1040 at tax time.
OPT IN TO A DEPENDENT CARE FLEXIBLE SPENDING ACCOUNT. If you pay for day care or employ an on-the-books nanny, depending on your filing status, you can contribute up to $ 5,000 (before taxes) to this account. So if your tax rate is normally 25 percent, a DCFSA could help you save $ 1,250 on your day-care bills each year. (Summer camp may be DCFSA-eligible too.)
You usually have a two-month window after the birth of your child to select new benefits, which includes signing up for a DCFSA. This is obviously a crazy period for parents, but you need to a) determine how much you should pony up (both parents can contribute to their own DCFSA, but the maximum combined benefit is $ 5,000), and b) designate one person as the account beneficiary.
No tax benefit comes without red tape. DCFSA money is "use it or lose it," which means your account balance can apply only to current-year child-care expenses, and whatever you don't spend by the end of the year goes the way of the dodo.
CLAIM THE CHILD TAX CREDIT WHEN YOU FILE. If your tax status is Married filing jointly, and you make less than $ 400,000 -- there's a phaseout after that -- you now receive $ 2,000 for each of your children in the form of a dollar-for-dollar tax reduction. Up to $ 1,400 of the credit is refundable, so you should get something even if you owe nothing in taxes.
Generally, the person who provides most of the support for the child -- and with whom the child primarily lives -- is the one who should claim it. Unfortunately, you can't take advantage of both the child and dependent care tax credit and the DCFSA for the same expenses. If you have a choice, you're usually better off with the latter.

Texto completo: State Department officials said the new measures were ordered in reciprocity for China's strict limits on the actions of American diplomats there.
WASHINGTON -- The United States has begun requiring Chinese diplomats to notify the State Department before any meetings they plan to have with local or state officials and with educational and research institutions, the State Department said Wednesday.
The move was a reaction to the Chinese government's rules for American diplomats in China, a senior State Department official said. American diplomats are generally required to obtain the permission of Chinese officials in Beijing before they can travel to official meetings in the provinces or to visit institutions, the official said.
The new State Department requirement was still less onerous than that imposed by China. Chinese diplomats are not required to seek permission for the meetings; they need only to notify the State Department in advance.
One aim of the new restrictions was to get China to relent on its limits on the actions of American diplomats, the official said, adding that the United States had complained to the Chinese government about the regulations, to no avail.
The new rule, described by State Department officials on the condition of anonymity, applies to officials working at all Chinese Missions in the United States and its territories, including at the United Nations.
The policy of reciprocity is sure to add to the growing tensions between the United States and China.
The Chinese Embassy in Washington said Wednesday that "the latest restrictions by the US State Department on Chinese diplomats are in violation of the Vienna Convention. So far, the Chinese side does not have similar requirements on American diplomats and consular officers in China."
President Trump started a trade war that has caused economic damage in both countries, and negotiators still have not reached agreement to resolve the dispute, though American officials say the two countries have reached a tentative partial deal.
American officials say the two nations have entered a new era of great power competition, and they are trying to put in place policies to constrain Chinese influence across the globe, which includes limiting its economic, military and technological footprints.
Some American officials have spoken about the need for American universities and research institutions to be warier of Chinese government efforts to steal research and intellectual property. The F.B.I. has been asking American university officials to monitor students or scholars visiting from certain Chinese state-affiliated research institutions or companies, NPR reported in June. The F.B.I. is focused on researchers in the sciences, technology, engineering and math.
The State Department informed the Chinese Embassy of the new rule in the past week, the official said. It has already received one notification from Chinese officials under the mandate, the official said, and expects to receive about 50 notifications a week.

‘The Hollow’: a ‘live music/movement mashup’

Texto completo: Founded in 2016 by Tyler Michaels King, Trademark Theater has mounted three productions. First came “The Boy and Robin Hood” in 2017, an action-packed retelling of the hoary tale. Then “Understood” in 2018, a contemporary relationship drama aimed at healing a divided nation. And now “The Hollow,” described as “a concept album performed live with movement and dance.” Or, more loosely, “a live music/movement mashup.”
One new theater company, three wildly different and ambitious productions. All originals and world premieres. What’s the common link? Trademark’s founder, Tyler Michaels King.
The inhumanly talented Tyler can sing, dance, act, direct and choreograph, as he’s shown in a swath of theaters across the Twin Cities. (Earlier this year, he dazzled in “Hedwig and the Angry Inch.” He was tragically underused in the Ordway’s “42nd Street,” though his tap dancing was divine.) Now, thanks to “The Hollow,” we know he’s not only a musical theater dancer but also a modern dancer.
Keeping track of what he’s up to is a full-time job. Last night at Crooners, he sang Frank Sinatra in the Dunsmore Room, accompanied by Louis Berg-Arnold on piano.
Three years in the making, “The Hollow” began as a work inspired by “The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.” It evolved over time into something altogether else, though a few hints of Washington Irving’s story remain in the song lyrics (“From a recurring dream, I run/Without my head!”).
In an acoustically perfect setting, you would understand the song lyrics during the performance. The Tek Box at the Cowles, where “The Hollow” takes place, is not an acoustically perfect setting. Plus there’s a lot going on, with four musicians (drums, electric guitar, electric bass, marimba), five singers and two dancers – almost too much to also pay attention to words. The lyrics are printed in a booklet that comes with the program, so you can read them before or after.
The music in “The Hollow” has been called “chamber grunge.” It’s a mix of folk, pop and rock, upbeat tunes and ballads, with arresting moments of atonality. Written by Jenna Wyse and Joey Ford (she’s on bass, he’s on guitar), the 18 songs are poetic and dreamy. Sometimes they’re loud. Bring earplugs or pick some up in the lobby before the show.
Tyler and Emily Michaels King are the dancers, aka movers. Emily has created or co-created Fringe Festival hits including “Hello Stranger” (2013), “Animus” (2017) and “Magic Girl” (2019). Her art encompasses performance, installations and aesthetic curation.
For much of the 70-minute running time, Emily and Tyler dance variations on intimacy, distance, anger, contentment, aggression and tenderness. They curl around and tangle up with each other. They lift each other into the air. They give each other shoves. Sometimes they move in unison. They’re beautiful to watch. Many of their movements are synchronous with the music, as when Tyler’s fingers touching Emily’s leg match precisely with notes on the marimba. This adds another dimension to the experience, a palpable physical connection to the music.
One dance is about almost falling, over and over again. A comment on losing one’s balance in life? In another, the lights strobe and Emily and Tyler’s movements seem fearful. During a song called “Happy Memory,” they jump up and down the whole time. It is not a short song. They make it look easy, as if they’re weightless and could do this forever. Near the end, they embrace and sink slowly to the ground. He lies on his back. She lies on her back on top of him. Together, they turn their heads and look at us. It’s a jolt of electricity.
A few times during the performance, just as Emily and Tyler leap upwards, the lights go out, leaving the theater in almost total blackness. It’s a wonderful effect. You can imagine the two of them rising in the dark, slipping through ceilings and into the sky.
“The Hollow” continues through Oct. 20 at the Tek Box in the Cowles Center. 7:30 p.m. Wednesday through Saturday, 2 p.m. Sunday. FMI and tickets ($20-25; $15 students).
Theater Latté Da’s “Chicago” extended for second time
Originally set to close Nov. 3, Theater Latté Da’s production of “Chicago,” Broadway’s longest-running American musical, will now close on Nov. 17. It’s almost bumping up against “All Is Calm,” which opens at the Ritz on Nov. 27.
In “Chicago,” nothing is calm. Based on real crimes, set in the Jazz Age, it’s two-plus hours of barely contained energy. The cast is brilliant and fierce. The whole thing feels on edge, a metaphor for our times. Everyone wants to be a celebrity. Systems are corrupt. The public is manipulated. The foreigner is hanged. It’s all razzle-dazzle and nobody’s got no class. When was this written? Yesterday? FMI and tickets (start at $33).
The picks
Tonight (Wednesday, Oct. 16) at the Walker: “The Lighthouse.” In Robert Eggers’ psychological thriller, Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson (“Twilight”) are isolated lighthouse keepers on a remote New England island in the 1890s. Eggers filmed his gothic ghost story in a real 70-foot lighthouse using 35mm B&W film and Melvillean dialogue. 2019, 110 min. 7 p.m. FMI including creepy trailer. Free.
Starts Thursday at noon in Landmark Center’s Courtroom 319: the Schubert Club’s 2019-20 Courtroom Concerts series. If you work in downtown St. Paul and you enjoy classical music, you’re in luck. On most Thursdays at noon, you can hear a free concert presented by the Schubert Club. It will last an hour, complimentary coffee will be served, and it’s wise to arrive a bit early if you can, since these concerts often reach capacity. The first performance of the season will feature the Saxophone Quartet. FMI.
Thursday at the U’s McNamara Alumni Center: Natalie Diaz reading. The Fall 2019 UMN English Writers Series begins with poet Natalie Diaz, a 2018 MacArthur Fellow, Mojave language activist, and author of “When My Brother Was an Aztec” (2012) and “Postcolonial Love Poem,” forthcoming from Graywolf in 2020. 7 p.m. Free. Note: The fall series continues with Rivka Galchen at the Weisman on Oct. 22, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie at Northrop on Oct. 23, Paul Murray at Lind Hall on Oct. 29 and Danielle Evans at the McNamara Alumni Center on Nov. 4. We’ll also tell you about these events nearer their dates, but if you want to mark your calendar, here they are.
Thursday through Saturday at the Guthrie : “Zafira and the Resistance.” With a despotic leader in power and Islamophobia on the rise, an Arab American teacher and her school are swept into the chaos. New Arab American Theater Works’ production of Minnesota playwright Kathryn Haddad’s play is timely and important. Co-directed by Malek Najjar and Zeina Salame, it’s a story of friendship, solidarity, and the power to stand up to tyranny. You’ll have plenty to talk about after. In the Dowling Studio. FMI and tickets ($25-32). Also next Friday-Sunday, Oct. 25-27.
Friday and Saturday: Border CrosSing: Black Christ of the Andes. Many of us heard Border CrosSing when they sang Osvaldo Golijov’s “La Pasión según San Marcus” at Sommerfest. Led by Ahmed Anzaldúa, they helped save the day when singers from Venezuela couldn’t get the passports and visas they needed. This weekend, they’ll perform a program that includes their own interpretation of Ariel Ramirez’s “Misa Criolla” and selections from jazz composer and pianist Mary Lou Williams’ rarely heard choral masterwork “Black Christ of the Andes.” Friday at Our Lady of Guadalupe in St. Paul, Saturday at Church of the Ascension in Minneapolis. 7 p.m. Pre-concert talk by Anzaldúa at 6:30. FMI and tickets ($20/15 seniors/10 students).
Sunday at the Walker: New York Times Panel Discussion: Is Local News Dying? More than 2,000 American newspapers have merged or closed over the last 15 years. Jamie Stockwell, deputy national editor at the New York Times; Richard Fausset, an Atlanta-based correspondent who chronicled the end of a Minnesota weekly, the Warroad Pioneer; former Warroad Pioneer publisher Rebecca Colden; and Suki Dardarian, the Star Tribune’s senior managing editor and VP will talk about local journalism, why it matters and what happens when newspapers close. 2 p.m. Free, but tickets are required and available at the main lobby desk starting at 1 p.m. Stay after for a reception with New York Times journalists and special guests.

Texto completo: WESTERVILLE, Ohio - The impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump unfolding in Washington was front and center on Tuesday as the largest field of candidates to date for a single presidential primary debate took to an Ohio stage.
"Our framers have imagined this moment, a moment when we can have a corrupt president ...," California Sen. Kamala Harris said. "This is one of those moments, and so Congress must act. ... As a former prosecutor, I know a confession when I see it. He did it in plain sight."
Said Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren: "Sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics. ... Donald Trump broke the law in the summer. He broke it again this fall. We took a constitutional oath, and that is that no one is above the law, and that includes the president of the United States. Impeachment is the way that we establish that this man will not be permitted to break the law over and over again without consequences."
The surging Ms. Warren was the most frequent target of other candidates on the stage, as they sought to pin her down on whether her take on Medicare-for-all health insurance would come with a tax increase.
South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg said his plan would be Medicare for all those who want it, preserving private insurance as part of the system. That is not an option under the concept as outlined by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.
"Medicare for all is the gold standard," Ms. Warren said. "It's the way we get health care coverage for every single American. ... We can pay for this. ... Costs are going to go up for the wealthy. They're going to go up for big corporations. They will not go up for middle-class families, and I will not sign a bill into law if it raises their costs."
Former Vice President Joe Biden also went after Ms. Warren on her plan as he and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar voiced support for expanding Obamacare to include a public option.
"The [Medicare-for-all] plan is going to cost least $30 trillion over 10 years," he said. "That is more on a yearly basis than the entire federal budget. ... A fireman and a school teacher making $100,000 a year, their taxes are going to go up about 10 grand. That's more than they will possibly save from this health care plan."
Said Mr. Sanders: "We spend twice as much per person as the people in any other major country on earth. I'd like to see the Democratic Party have the guts to stand up to stand up to the drug companies and the insurance companies and tell them that the function of health care is the guaranteed care to all people, not to make a hundred zillion dollars in profit."
Mr. Biden also found himself on the defensive in addressing conflicts of interest with his son Hunter's role on the board of a Ukrainian gas company while his father was in the White House.
On Sunday, Mr. Biden had vowed that "no one in my family will have an office in the White House, will sit in on meetings as if they're a cabinet member, will in fact have any business relationship with anyone that relates to a foreign corporation or a foreign country."
But CNN anchor Anderson Cooper asked, "If it's not OK for a president's family to be involved in foreign businesses, why was it OK for your son when you were vice president?"
Mr. Biden faltered some before offering, "My son did nothing wrong," he said. "I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States government in rooting out corruption in Ukraine.''
Dems are investigating whether Mr. Trump used the power of his office to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate his potential 2020 opponent and son. Tuesday's debate was the first since the U.S. House launched its impeachment inquiry and since Mr. Sanders suffered a heart attack.
Half of the 12 candidates on that debate stage - Mr. Sanders, Ms. Warren. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, Ms. Harris, and Ms. Klobuchar - may also have direct votes in determining Mr. Trump's fate, either for impeachment in the House or during a trial in the Senate.
The candidates also took aim at Mr. Trump over his decision last week to pull troops from northern Syria, seen as paving the way for NATO ally Turkey to launch a long-planned offensive to clear the region of Kurds, allies to the United States in the fight against the Islamic State group, but considered to be terrorists by Turkey.
"I would have a hard time today looking at Afghan civilians or soldiers in the eye after what just happened over there ...," Mr. Buttigieg, a military veteran, said. "You take away the honor of our soldiers, you might as well go after their body armor next. This president has betrayed American values. Our credibility is in tatters."
Some of the field also exchanged fire on gun reform in the wake of recent mass shootings, including in downtown Dayton two months ago where a shooter with a semi-automatic rifle took the lives of nine people, including the shooter's sister, in an open-air entertainment district. Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley, a Democrat and outspoken advocate for gun reform, was seated in front of the candidates in the audience.
Mr. O'Rourke was asked a follow-up to his remark in the last debate - "Hell yeah, we're going to take away your AR-15, your AK-47" - about how he would enforce a mandatory assault weapon buyback.
"I expect my fellow Americans to follow the law, the same way that we enforce any provision, any law that we have right now," he said. "We don't go door-to-door to do anything in this country."
When addressing laws written by the Republican-controlled General Assembly in Ohio seen as restricting access to abortion, Ms. Harris said she would have her justice department review any such law to see if it is in line with Roe vs. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court ruling legalizing abortion.
"These state legislators who are outdated and out of touch, mostly men who are telling women what to do with their bodies, there has to be accountability and consequence," she said.
Ms. Klobuchar said she would have Roe v. Wade written into law.
"You, Donald Trump, are not on the side of women," she said. "You are not on the side of people of this country when over 75 percent of people who want to keep Roe v. Wade on the books."
Mr. Sanders, who at 78 was the oldest candidate on stage, sought to reassure supporters of his vigor going into the debate following his recent heart attack and stent procedure that took him off the campaign trail.
"I'm healthy. I'm feeling great," he said at one point to laughs from the audience as he was asked about concerns about his age upon taking office.
Said Mr. Booker, "We know that the unhealthiest person running for president is Donald Trump."
Also trying to make the case for their candidacies in the few minutes they were afforded were former housing secretary Julián Castro, tech businessman Andrew Yang and, for the first time, billionaire Tom Steyer, whose campaign has revolved around Mr. Trump's impeachment.
Otterbein University hosted the fourth primary debate for CNN and The New York Times in the Columbus suburb of Westerville.

Texto completo: ALBANY - Radio listeners were stunned Tuesday when Gov. Cuomo dropped the N-word during an on-air discussion about discrimination against Italian-Americans.
The governor, quoting a New York Times editorial about the racist language used to describe Italian immigrants in decades past, said they were often referred to as "n--r w-s."
Pivoting away from a question about the state's delayed Medicaid payments, Cuomo cited the Gray Lady's use of the term and steered the conversation toward anti-Italian sentiments.
"The Times also said in an article the other day, apropos of nothing, they were talking about it," the governor told WAMC host Alan Chartock. "Going back to the Italian-Americans, because now you have me. They used an expression that southern Italians were called quote-unquote, and pardon my language, but I'm just quoting The Times, n--r w-s. N-word w-s as a derogatory comment."
The Times published an op-ed titled "How Italians Became White" over the weekend analyzing discrimination faced by Italians in the past. The term was used in the piece as an illustration of racist insults southern Italians in particular faced.
Cuomo took heat for his use of the word with some of his fellow pols calling on him to apologize.
"That word is a stain on this country's soul," said Working Families Party National Director Maurice Mitchell. "No white person should use it in any context, for any reason - least of all as an example of how he thinks he has been unfairly treated. Gov. Cuomo (inset) needs to apologize right now."
Public Advocate Jumanne Williams said there was no excuse for using the term in any context.
"The flippant and unnecessary use of the word on live radio gives people further permission to use this racist term that remains a stain on this country," he said. "The Governor should understand that regardless of what community he was referencing, the misguided use of the word still rings with hundreds of years of pain, and should apologize for that. But hey, at least it wasn't Blackface."
Others defended the governor.
"The governor was quoting a New York Times story and was using it for context," said Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie (D-Bronx). "I didn't take any offense at his comments."
The remark comes a day after the governor celebrated his heritage and marched down Fifth Ave. in the Columbus Day parade. He also announced Monday that the state would be ponying up funds for a statue of Saint Frances Cabrini. The move came after a city program run by First Lady Chirlane McCray decided against dedicating a memorial to the Italian-born Cabrini despite her leading a public poll.
Cuomo called the shunning of the saint an "affront" to the Italian-American community.
Seven other women were chosen to get statues as part of the "She Built NYC" statue program even though Cabrini got "by far" the most votes out of 300 women, Cuomo said.
Cuomo on Saturday told the crowd at a gala for the Columbus Citizens Foundation that Italian-Americans must "stand up."
"As Italian-Americans, we must also remember that we ourselves are not immune from attack. The ugliness of Italian-American stereotyping is still alive and well. Our battle is not over," he said.
Cuomo defended his TV host brother Chris Cuomo over the summer after video went viral of the CNN anchor blowing up on a heckler who called him "Fredo."

Texto completo: Elizabeth Warren was the overwhelming favorite among the 2020 presidential candidates in a straw poll conducted by the Broward Young Democrats on the eve of the party's fourth presidential debate in Ohio.
Warren left the other candidates in the dust, finishing far ahead of her competitors for the Democratic presidential nomination.
The U.S. senator from Massachusetts received 27 first choice votes (her closest competitor received 15). She received 19 second choice votes (her closest competitor received nine).
Joe Biden, former vice president who is well known, and Andrew Yang, a former technology executive who isn't, effectively tied for second place.
Kamala Harris, a U.S. senator from California, and Bernie Sanders, a senator from Vermont, tied for fourth place.
"Now it seems like people are really consolidating," Clay Miller, president of the Broward Young Democrats, said after the voting. "They are falling in love," something he said wasn't as widespread in June, when the group held its first straw poll.
The 69 people who voted Monday night each picked a first, second and third place choice among 17 Democratic presidential candidates, only 12 of whom have done well enough in public opinion polls and fundraising to get spots on stage for the CNN/New York Times debate.
To gauge strength of support, the organizers awarded three points for every first-place choice that went to a candidate, two for a second choice vote and one for a third choice votes. Warren received 125 points.
Supporters of each candidate were allowed to make a four-minute pitch - with ground rules that don't apply to the candidates themselves, either at campaign events or during debates. They had to stay positive and couldn't tell lies about the other candidates.
"We want to make sure that we come out of this primary in a healthy state," said Andrew Dolberg, the Young Democrats board member who ran the voting, cautioning activists not to "try to spin everything."
"We understand there is a lot of flexibility and a lot of truths," he said. "There is no outright lying about your candidate."
Monday was the second time this year Broward's Young Democrats held a straw poll and the second time Warren performed far ahead of the other candidates. A June straw poll showed a groundswell of support for Warren - before she caught fire politically, began a significant rise in nationwide polls and emerged as the Biden's leading competitor.
Straw polls aren't scientifically, statistically valid measurements of support. And Monday's was open to any Democrat who turned out, regardless of whether the person was a member of the Young Democrats, came from another county - or was over 40, the cutoff age for membership.
Sean Phillippi, a Democratic strategist and founder of the political data firm TLE Analytics, said a straw vote can provide some insights.
"It can be a measure of intensity," Phillippi said. Doing well in a straw poll is a sign that a particular candidate has a base of grassroots support helpful in the general election.
Mitch Ceasar, a former chairman of the Broward Democratic Party who is running for county supervisor of elections, said the straw poll voters are active.
"This group actually works, volunteers on the street, goes door to door," Ceasar said. "This is an excellent political barometer."
The format allows, and in many ways incentivizes campaigns that want to make a splash to make sure supporters turn out. On Monday, an impassioned group of Yang supporters did just that. He received 15 first-choice votes and three second- choice votes in the overall voting.
But Yang didn't do as well in voting of club members only.
Among members of the Young Democrats, Warren was also the top finisher. Biden was second and Pete Buttigieg and Harris were effectively tied for third. Yang was at the back of the pack with other lesser-known candidates in the club-members-only vote.
Illustrating the potential pluses and hoping to avoid an embarrassing result, the major campaigns made sure they were represented.
The Warren campaign sent in one of its state coordinators, based in Wellington, to speak on her behalf.
The Biden campaign sent a representative from Miami, Chris Wills, who came with props: a life-size cardboard cutout of Biden and a large inflatable ice cream cone labeled a "Joe Cone," after the ice cream that the former vice president's campaign distributed outside the site of the June presidential debate in Miami. (Only a handful of people took selfies with the cardboard Biden.)
Mitchell Stollberg of Margate, who is 65, represented Sanders at the Young Democrats. He's a leader in Broward Progressive Democrats of America and the Broward chapter of the group Our Revolution. He emphasized Sanders' progressive policies, including the Medicare for All universal health plan.
Bryce Goldberg of Sunrise, representing Andrew Yang, touted the candidate's concerns about job losses from automation, something Yang believes drove voters away from Democrats and toward Trump in 2016.
And Harris was represented by Coral Springs Commissioner Joshua Simmons, who said Trump would "never recover" after facing his candidate in a general election debate.
Biden received 13 first-choice votes and seven second-choice votes. Sanders received seven first-choice votes and seven second-choice votes. Harris got three first-choice votes and nine second-choice votes.
No one was present to speak on behalf of Michael Bennett, Steve Bullock, John Delaney, Tulsi Gabbard, Amy Klobuchar, Wayne Messam, Tim Ryan, Tom Steyer or Marianne Williamson. (Steyer wasn't on the Young Democrats ballot, but he will be on the Ohio debate stage.
When Dolberg asked if there was Messam representative present, there was brief laughter. Messam is the mayor of Miramar but has failed to register in public opinion surveys or raise much money. The only Floridian running for president, he got zero votes in the straw poll.
Jesse Rubens of Plantation answered the call to speak on behalf of Julian Castro, a former secretary of Housing and Urban Development. He touted Castro's plans and said he could win Hispanic votes.
"I think that he is just an awesome dude who represents the best of America," Rubens said. But he was wearing a Warren shirt and said his real desire is to see Warren as the presidential nominee and Castro as the vice-presidential candidate.

Stagecoach 2020 lineup 'all about high energy'

Texto completo: Yee-haw! The full lineup for the 2020 Stagecoach: California's Country Music Festival is in.
Headlining the festival will be Thomas Rhett, Carrie Underwood and Eric Church.
Other festival highlights include Lil Nas X and Billy Ray Cyrus on Friday, April 24, ZZ Top on Saturday, April 25, and Alan Jackson on Sunday, April 26.
In 2019, the festival shattered its own all-time attendance record, according to a prepared statement from talent buyer Stacy Vee.
"The Stagecoach 2020 lineup is all about high energy and getting every type of country music fan fired up," she continued.
Notably, the 2020 lineup features two LGBTQ trailblazers in country music: Lil Nas X and Orville Peck. Earlier this year, Lil Nas X — a gay, black rapper and singer — caused controversy with his single "Old Town Road," which snagged No. 1 spots on both Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart and Hot R&B/Hip-Hop at the same time. Billboard ultimately pulled the hit from the country chart, claiming it didn't embody enough country music elements.
Orville Peck is the stage name of an up-and-coming Canadian country star who wears a mask to hide his identity. He's been vocal in the press about his crossover from punk, and the desire for diversity within country music.
"There has always been people of color making country music, and there has always been queer cowboys and cowgirls, like K.D. Lang," Peck recently told the New York Times.
Of course, the 2020 Stagecoach lineup also includes long-standing veterans, like two-time Grammy Award-winner Jackson, Neal McCoy and roots rock band ZZ Top, which rose to fame with several hits in the 1980s.
Unlike last year, the lineup doesn't feel saturated in the "bro country" that dominates today's charts, though it's represented with acts like Chris Lane and Riley Green.
Underwood, who also topped the 2016 bill along with Church, is the first solo female headliner since Shania Twain kicked off her comeback at the festival in 2017 (Trisha Yearwood joined husband Garth Brooks in his Mane Stage slot a year later).
This year, other notable female performers include 61-year-old Tanya Tucker, Nashville rebel Nikki Lane, who will again curate a Stage Stop Marketplace on the festival grounds, and The Haden Triplets, whose father is jazz legend Charlie Haden.
In 2020, celebrity chef Guy Fieri also returns with his Stagecoach Smokehouse featuring barbecue vendors, and DJ Diplo will perform another late Sunday night set in the Palamino tent. Last year, the DJ brought out Cyrus and Lil Nas X to perform their remix of "Old Town Road."
The full list of performers:
Friday, April 24 Thomas Rhett, Brett Young, Dustin Lynch, Billy Ray Cyrus, Morgan Wallen, Lil Nas X, Mitchell Tenpenny, Nikki Lane, RaeLynn, Hardy Pam Tillis, Ingrid Andres, The Last Bandoleros, Seaforth, Willie Jones, Whitney Rose
Saturday, April 25 Carrie Underwood, Dan & Shay, Midland, ZZ Top, Locash, Tanya Tucker, Jimmie Allen, Marty Stuart & His Fabulous Superlatives, Ryan Bingham, Tenille Townes, Caylee Hammock, Jade Jackson, Temecula Road, Orville Peck, Teddy Robb, Ian Noe, Courtney Marie Andrews, Payton Smith
Sunday, April 26 Eric Church, Alan Jackson, Jon Pardi, Bryan Adams, Chris Lane, Riley Green, Neal McCoy, Shenandoah, Paul Cauthen, Gabby Barrett, Niko Moon, Hayes Carll, Brandon Ratcliff, Hailey Whitters, The Haden Triplets, Laci Kaye Booth, Desure

Hunter Biden denies wrongdoing overseas

Texto completo: WESTERVILLE, Ohio — Hunter Biden, former vice president Joe Biden's son, said in an interview released Tuesday that he probably would not have been named to the board of a foreign company if his last name weren't Biden and acknowledged “poor judgment," but he rejected suggestions by President Trump that he and his father had engaged in wrongdoing.
“Did I make a mistake? Well maybe in the grand scheme of things, yeah," Biden told ABC News. “But did I make a mistake based upon some ethical lapse? Absolutely not."
“I don't think that there's a lot of things that would have happened in my life if my last name wasn't Biden," he said.
The interview came two days after Hunter Biden pledgednot to work for foreign companies if his father became president, and hours before the fourth Democratic debate.
His sudden comments signal the level of concern among Joe Biden's allies that the overseas dealings of the younger Biden had become a potentially damaging liability in his father's campaign.
Trump has seized on Hunter Biden's dealings in Ukraine and China to initiate unfounded attacks on the former vice president. Trump also asked the government of Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, helping to trigger an impeachment inquiry. Hunter Biden signaled that by backing away from foreign dealings, he hoped to eliminate the controversy as a campaign issue for his father.

Clash of Viewpoints, Not Always on Target

Texto completo: Our reporters followed all of the exchanges and fact-checked the candidates, providing context and explanation on the policy debates.
Twelve candidates vying for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination took the debate stage Tuesday night in Ohio for the fourth round of debates. The showdown -- the biggest presidential primary debate in history -- was moderated by journalists from The New York Times and CNN.
Here is how the candidates' remarks stacked up against the truth.
Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., referring to the withdrawal of American troops from Syria, wrongly asserted that American troops are "now being fired on by Assad's people."
"I would not have withdrawn the troops and would not have withdrawn the additional thousand troops in Iraq which are in retreat now being fired on by Assad's people."
This is false. It is possible that Mr. Biden misspoke; he also referred to Iraq when he seemed to mean Syria. But there does not appear to be any evidence that American troops have been fired on by forces deployed by President Bashar al-Assad of Syria.
However, United States troops in northern Syria did come under fire on Friday from Turkish positions, according to Pentagon officials. No troops were wounded, but officials said the episode highlighted the risks to United States forces as Turkey waged its offensive against Kurdish militia in the region.
"The explosion occurred within a few hundred meters of a location outside the security mechanism zone and in an area known by the Turks to have U.S. forces present," a Pentagon spokesman, Capt. Brook DeWalt of the Navy, said in a statement.
One of the biggest risks to the remaining American troops as they pull back will most likely be attacks from a Turkish-backed Syrian militia called the Free Syrian Army, which has spearheaded the Turkish offensive in many places along the border. Those troops are supported by Turkish army artillery and mortar fire, and Turkish air force strikes.
American officials say these Turkish-backed militias are less disciplined than regular Turkish soldiers, and deliberately or inadvertently have fired on retreating American troops. Syrian forces have also surged back into the contested region in support for their new alliance with the Kurds.
Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator, said that while his "Medicare for all" health care plan would require tax increases on middle-class families, their overall spending would go down.
"I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up. They're going to go up significantly for the wealthy and for virtually everybody, the tax increase they pay will be substantially less than what they were paying for premiums and out-of-pocket expenses."
This lacks evidence. Mr. Sanders's health care plan would substantially increase the amount that the federal government spends. Estimates of its precise cost vary, but according to an estimate from the conservative Mercatus Center, which Mr. Sanders has mentioned approvingly, federal spending would need to increase by about 10 percent of the country's gross domestic product, triple what the government spends on the military. But under Medicare for all, Americans who currently pay health insurance premiums or pay directly when they go to the doctor or pharmacy would be relieved of those costs. For most American families, that would be a substantial savings.
But that does not mean that "virtually everybody" would end up paying less over all. Mr. Sanders has suggested various possible tax increases that could pay for this expansion, including a payroll tax that would affect workers across the economic spectrum. He has not provided enough details about the mix and magnitude of taxes for economists to measure what sorts of families would be better or worse off under Medicare for all. An Urban Institute analysis of Mr. Sanders's 2016 health care proposal, which included more tax details, found that the proposed taxes would only pay for about half of the cost of the plan.
Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator, repeatedly avoided answering a question about whether financing her health care plan would require middle-class tax increases, saying instead that their "costs" would not go up.
"I have made clear what my principles are here. And that is costs will go up for the wealthy and for big corporations, and for hard-working middle-class families, costs will go down."
Ms. Warren has indeed proposed a number of large tax increases on the wealthy and corporations, including a new wealth tax, a corporate profits tax and an expansion of Social Security taxes up the income spectrum. But she has also earmarked close to all of the revenue raised by those taxes to pay for other domestic spending priorities, including free public college tuition and child care subsidies.
A Medicare for all health care program, like the one from Mr. Sanders that Ms. Warren has co-sponsored, would require substantial additional government spending. Ms. Warren would not say who would pay tax increases necessary to fund it. But it may be hard to squeeze that much more money out of the rich and corporations alone, beyond the new taxes she has already suggested. Her language about "costs" does provide the possibility that she would raise middle-class taxes, but ensure that middle-class families would save enough on health care spending to come out ahead.
Democrats debated the merits of adding a wealth tax on total assets of the richest Americans, an idea that has been spearheaded by Ms. Warren.
"Taxing income is not going to get you where you need to be the way taxing wealth does."
The wealth tax that Ms. Warren has proposed would represent a major shift in American tax policy, which has generally been focused on taxing income. Ms. Warren's plan would raise $ 2.6 trillion over a decade to pay for proposals that would vastly expand the country's social safety net. Mr. Sanders and Tom Steyer have also called for wealth taxes. And on Tuesday night, Beto O'Rourke, Pete Buttigieg and Senator Amy Klobuchar also expressed openness to the concept, suggesting the party at large was shifting more broadly in that direction.
While wealth taxes have populist appeal in that they can raise large amounts of revenue on the backs of a relatively small number of people, they do come with their share of potential problems. Critics warn that wealth taxes will spur new forms of tax avoidance, that they failed and were repealed in European countries and that they could be unconstitutional.
Mr. Biden, in defending his moderate policies compared with his progressive competitors, claimed only he could claim substantive achievements.
"I'm the only one on this stage that has gotten anything really big done."
This is mostly false. Whether a politician's accomplishments are "big" is a subjective judgment. But other leading Democratic candidates have had substantial policy successes.
Ms. Warren, then a bankruptcy law expert, envisioned and spearheaded the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in 2010 to address the excesses of the financial services industry after the financial crisis that began in 2008. Mr. Sanders, then the ranking member on the Senate Veterans' Affairs committee, helped author legislation with Senator John McCain that created the Veterans Choice program in 2014. Kamala Harris, as California's attorney general, won her state a sizable share of a settlement with big banks over home foreclosure abuses in 2012.
Mr. Buttigieg, the South Bend, Ind. mayor, highlighted suicide as a major, underdiscussed source of gun violence in the country.
That so-called red flag laws could help prevent suicides, "which are not being talked about nearly enough as a huge part of the gun violence epidemic in this country."
This is true. Mr. Buttigieg is correct that the majority of gun deaths in the United States are deaths because of suicide, a major and growing public health problem that is rarely emphasized in the political discussion of guns.
Research on so-called red flag laws, which allow a judge to temporarily confiscate firearms from people found to be a risk to themselves or others, has found that they have been successful in reducing suicide deaths. There is less evidence about whether they are an effective strategy for reducing homicides or mass shootings, though some anecdotal accounts suggest they may have prevented some acts of violence.
Julián Castro, the former housing secretary, said three battleground states had lost jobs under Mr. Trump.
"Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania actually in the latest jobs data have lost jobs, not gained them."
This is misleading. The three states all gained jobs in August, according to the latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. From July to August, Ohio gained about 6,400 jobs; Michigan about 3,700; and Pennsylvania about 4,700. The number of unemployed people, however, has also risen in Ohio by 2,500 and in Pennsylvania by 4,400. Over all, since Mr. Trump's first full month in office in February 2017, Ohio has gained 120,000 jobs, Michigan 109,000 and Pennsylvania 114,000.

Texto completo: At a time of transition for the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, the artists on the shortlist span generations and genres.
At a moment of transition for the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, a new class of nominees for induction in 2020 puts generational and genre-based divides on full display: The Notorious B.I.G., Whitney Houston, the Dave Matthews Band and Motörhead are among the first-timers on the ballot, while returning acts getting another chance include Nine Inch Nails, Depeche Mode, Judas Priest, and Rufus featuring Chaka Khan.
The 16 nominees up for inclusion at next year's ceremony -- scheduled to take place May 2 in Cleveland -- are rounded out by Kraftwerk (nominated five times previously), MC5 (four previous nominations) and Todd Rundgren (one), plus the shortlist newcomers Pat Benatar, Soundgarden, T-Rex, Thin Lizzy and the Doobie Brothers.
The wide swath of options may reflect what the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Foundation's incoming chairman, John Sykes, called a need to evolve, amid years of criticism about the diversity of the inductees. Sykes, the president of entertainment enterprises for the radio conglomerate iHeartMedia and a former MTV executive, will take over for the Rolling Stone founder and long-running face of the Hall, Jann Wenner, on Jan. 1.
"The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame could become irrelevant because rock as we knew it in the '60s is beginning to age out," Sykes told The Cleveland Plain Dealer in an interview earlier this month. "We have to evolve, and we have to change, because music is changing." (Wenner has consistently brushed off concerns that the Hall admitted too few women and people of color, telling The New York Times last month, "Musical achievements have got to be race-neutral and gender-neutral.")
In recent years, the Rock Hall, which was founded in 1983 and became a museum in Cleveland in 1995, has grappled with shifting cultural winds and the idea of a broader tent, welcoming acts like Janet Jackson, Tupac Shakur and N.W.A, in addition to younger, still-active groups who broke through in the 1990s, like Green Day, Pearl Jam and Radiohead.
Musicians become eligible for nomination 25 years after the release of their first commercial recording. A private nominating committee then makes its picks, which are voted on by more than 1,000 insiders (artists, historians and industry experts), who are instructed to consider "an artist's musical influence on other artists, length and depth of career and the body of work, innovation and superiority in style and technique." (Fans can also vote at rockhall.com beginning Tuesday, with the Top 5 vote-getters making up one official ballot.)
Inductees, typically between five and seven, will be announced in January, with the 35th annual ceremony to follow in May. A version of the show will be aired on HBO and SiriusXM at a later date, though it has yet to be announced.
Eligible acts that were overlooked this year, some of whom have been previously nominated, include: Willie Nelson, Beck, Sonic Youth, Rage Against the Machine, Mötley Crüe, Iron Maiden, Joy Division and the J. Geils Band.
The Notorious B.I.G., who was killed in 1997 at the age of 24 after completing only two albums, is eligible for the first time this year. He would be just the seventh hip-hop artist inducted, and the first since Shakur in 2017. (LL Cool J, a five-time nominee, failed to clear the final hurdle last year, and was not nominated this time.)
Others in the bunch have waited far longer: The Doobie Brothers, a more traditional classic rock choice from the 1970s, have been eligible since 1996, as has Thin Lizzy. Rundgren, eligible in 1995, and T-Rex, first up for inclusion in 1993, date back even further, while MC5, back for the fourth consecutive year as a nominee, could have made the cut starting in 1991.

With Bargain Shrimp, Added Chemicals

Texto completo: What exactly is added to shrimp, and how can you avoid it at the store?
Whether farmed or wild caught, the cheaper the shrimp, the more likely it is to have been treated with chemicals, particularly sodium tripolyphosphate and sodium bisulfite.
Sodium bisulfite is used to keep shrimp shells from undergoing melanosis (also called black spot), which is a darkening of the head and shell after the shrimp are harvested and exposed to oxygen. This reaction is harmless -- think of it as the marine equivalent to the browning of apple flesh after you cut it.
The chemical is part of the slushy brine mix used to store the shrimp on most fishing boats before they make it to shore for further processing. It may also be used on farmed shrimp when the processing facility is far from the farm.
Adding sodium bisulfite doesn't actually keep the shrimp from deteriorating, though; it's purely for aesthetics. American consumers want their shrimp to be perfectly pink, without any shadows.
But a little melanosis is not necessarily a bad thing. Steve Philips, seafood manager at Wegmans, said melanosis does not affect flavor -- and in fact it can show that the shrimp are chemical-free (which is one of the criteria for all the shrimp sold at the supermarket chain).
"The absence of melanosis is not the presence of freshness," Mr. Philips said, "and the presence of melanosis is the absence of chemicals."
Tripolyphosphate is the industry's way of putting its finger on the scale. Often also used with scallops, the chemical causes seafood to absorb water, increasing its weight by anywhere from 7 percent to 10 percent.
Shrimp treated with tripolyphosphate cooks differently from untreated shrimp. With such a high moisture content, they steam rather than sear when you try to sauté them. They also have a bouncy, rubbery texture and stay oddly translucent even after cooking.
Jim Gossen, the president of the Gulf Seafood Foundation, compares adding tripolyphosphate to seafood to adding water to ham.
"You can buy deli ham that's 40 percent water, and it's flavorless," he said. "Or you can buy prosciutto."
Tripolyphosphate and sodium bisulfite are considered safe in low doses by the Food and Drug Administration. However, about 1 percent of the general population in the United States has a sensitivity to sulfites.
Tripolyphosphate is generally added to shrimp after it's been peeled, so to avoid it, try to buy shell-on shrimp and peel it yourself. (Save the shells for shrimp stock.) This is not true of sodium bisulfite, though.
You could also read the fine print on the packaging: Chemicals are required to be listed on labels, which you can find on bags of shrimp pulled directly from the freezer case.
As for the piles of shrimp on ice you find at supermarkets and fishmongers, the only way to know for sure if they're chemical-free is to ask -- and hope the person behind the counter knows the answer.

Get the most from a digital wallet

Texto completo: So many stores now accept payments from smartphone apps that, in some places, it's almost possible to get through the week and zip through checkouts without fumbling for cash, cards or plastic store-rewards tags. Your phone's digital wallet is also a handy place to store electronic airline boarding passes, event tickets and more.
But many people still haven't tried mobile payments or don't know how to organize their digital wallets. If you're one of them, this guide is for you.
Step 1: Find your app
Apple Wallet (which houses Apple Pay), Google Pay and Samsung Pay are three common payment apps, and one of them is most likely on your phone already. Your app store has others, but make sure you pick a trusted platform.
While you can use your payment method for in-app and online purchases, you'll need a mobile device with a near field communication (NFC) chip inside to pay at the terminals in stores. Most recent smartphones are NFC-equipped, and Samsung's system also works with magnetic-stripe and chip-card readers. Some smartwatches also have mobilepay apps.
Step 2: Get set with security
You must protect your digital wallet's contents, so make sure your phone's settings are configured to lock the screen with a passcode or a biometric method like a fingerprint, face or iris scan - which you also need to authorize purchases. As for your financial information, payment apps use encryption and other technology to further lock up data; security measures are detailed on the Apple, Google and Samsung sites.
Worried about a lost phone? Apple, Google and Samsung allow you to remotely wipe your device over the internet.
Step 3: Add your payment cards
When you first open a payment app, it guides you through adding your credit or debit card. Typically, you just open the app, tap the "Get Started" or "Add Payment Card" button and follow along. You scan or type in your card number, and wait for confirmation and verification from the card's backing financial institution. If you'd rather read up on the setup steps before you plunge in, guides on how to configure Apple Pay, Google Pay and Samsung Pay are on the company support sites.
Beyond credit and debit cards, the apps also walk you through configuring peer-to-peer payments like Apple Cash, Google Pay's funds exchange or Samsung Pay Cash. PayPal accounts can also be linked to Apple Pay, Google Pay and Samsung Pay.
Step 4: Import loyalty cards, tickets and more
Retail-store rewards cards can be imported by entering or scanning the bar code on the physical card with the store's own app. To find compatible apps, open Apple Wallet, scroll down to Edit Passes and select Find Apps for Wallet. In Google Pay, open the app and tap the Passes icon, tap the Pass button and select "Loyalty program" or "Gift card." And in Samsung Pay, open the app and tap the Memberships button.
Airline boarding passes, museum memberships and event tickets can also be added to the wallet in various ways, like scanning a QR code or selecting the "add to wallet" button in an email or a text message. When you get to the gate or counter, just tap up the appropriate pass and present it for scanning.
Step 5: Pay up
When you are ready to pay for purchases in stores that accept mobile money, just open your digital wallet app, hold the phone near the wireless reader at the register and authorize the payment with a body par: or passcode. Your phone's screen will confirm the transaction.
Step 6: Manage your wallet
Like its physical counterpart, your digital wallet will eventually need pruning when it becomes cluttered with outdated passes, or you want to remove or change a payment card.
With Apple Wallet in iOS 13, you can remove multiple passes by scrolling down to tap the Edit Passes button and deleting the tickets and boarding cards you no longer need.
To delete or edit individual passes and cards open on the screen, tap the icon in the top-right corner to get to the controls. The Wallet & Apple Pay area of the iOS settings also lets you manage your credit and debit cards.
In Google Pay, delete a loyalty card or pass open on screen by tapping the More icon in the upper-right corner and choose Remove. To delete a payment card, tap (he Payment tab and then the More icon.

Key goal for Texans Julián Castro and Beto O'Rourke in Tuesday's debate: Make the next one

Texto completo: The two Democratic presidential candidates from Texas are set to appear Tuesday evening in what threatens to be their last debate, a high-stakes opportunity to propel their campaigns out of the lower tier and prove they deserve their spots onstage.
Julián Castro and Beto O'Rourke are among 12 candidates who will take the stage at 7 p.m. at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio, a suburb of Columbus. Hosted by CNN and The New York Times, it is the fourth debate of the primary, and the last one before qualification requirements go up again, potentially leaving the Texans on the sidelines.
In the short term, though, both Texans are being closely watched for their potential collisions with other candidates Tuesday evening. O'Rourke, the former El Paso congressman, is heading into the debate on the heels of his latest clash with South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, while Castro's reputation precedes him after he stood out in the first three debates for his unflinching interrogations of some rivals.
"Some folks have thought that I've been somewhat assertive on the debate stage," Castro said late last month at The Texas Tribune Festival in Austin. "I can tell you that whoever's on the debate stage [in the general election] ... Donald Trump is not gonna be nice."
Still, the debates have proven to be somewhat frustrating experiences for the Texans. Both have had standout moments and enjoyed some fundraising success afterward. But neither has received a discernible boost in the polls as a result.
The latest debate falls on the last day for candidates to report their third-quarter fundraising to the Federal Election Commission. Four days ago, O'Rourke announced he raised $4.5 million over the period, while Castro has not released his numbers yet but offered other fundraising details over the weekend that indicated he took in at least $3.2 million.
Both hauls are improvements over the Texans' second-quarter fundraising but still far behind many of their competitors, especially those that will share the stage with them Tuesday.
The 12-candidate lineup is the biggest for a single night yet, and opportunities abound for conflict. For O'Rourke, that may mean a direct confrontation with Buttigieg, who he has traded barbs with in a series of media appearances and tweets over recent weeks.
The two tangled anew Monday over O'Rourke's crusade for a mandatory buyback program for assault weapons. Buttigieg has suggested the idea plays into Republicans' hands, and O'Rourke has countered that Buttigieg is being too cautious and calculating.
"I get it," Buttigieg said in a Snapchat interview published Monday morning. "He needs to pick a fight in order to stay relevant, but this is about a difference on policy."
O'Rourke shot back on Twitter: "[Buttigieg] can say whatever he wants, but guns kill 40,000 people each year. Those people deserve action. I’ll be fighting for them."
O'Rourke has also faced scrutiny in recent days for saying that religious institutions that oppose gay marriage should lose their tax-exempt status. His campaign later walked back the position, saying O'Rourke was referring to institutions that discriminate, but that did not stop at least two rivals, Buttigieg and Elizabeth Warren, from plainly expressing their disagreement, not to mention an avalanche of GOP criticism.
Castro has not been at the center of as much controversy in recent days, though his aggressive debate style is well known at this point. During the last debate, his questioning of Joe Biden's memory hit on a sensitive subject — the former vice president's mental acuity — that was one of the more dramatic storylines to come out of the event.
Beyond the Ohio debate, though, both Texans are staring down the possibility that they do not qualify for the next one, which is scheduled for Nov. 20 in Georgia. Both candidates have the 165,000 donors required for that debate, according to their campaigns, but neither is close to satisfying the most realistic polling requirement for them: 3% in four national or early voting state polls. Castro has none of the qualifying surveys, while O'Rourke has one.
They have until Nov. 13 to hit the threshold, though neither has been on a promising trajectory lately.
Faced with the November cutoff, Castro has taken a somewhat alarmist approach, sending out a fundraising email late last month warning it would be the "end of my campaign" if he did not qualify for the November debate. Meanwhile, a confident O'Rourke and his campaign have sought to reassure backers not to sweat the November cutoff.
"There is a lot of things to be worried about in the world, and qualifying for the debates is not something that you need to carry on your shoulders," O'Rourke campaign manager Jen O'Malley Dillion said in a recent weekly update for supporters, responding to someone asking how worried they should be about making it on the November debate stage. "Don't worry — we got this one."
Failure to qualify for the November debate could force a fresh round of speculation about the political futures of Castro and O'Rourke. The filing deadline for the Texas primary is just a few weeks later — Dec. 9 — and while both Texans have insisted they will not return home to run for U.S. Senate, the timeline could create a new urgency among their supporters.
A day before the debate, Castro projected the image of a candidate not going anywhere, unveiling 58 endorsements, including at least 14 from Texas. One of them, former El Paso state Rep. Norma Chávez, gave a potential preview of the Ohio debate in explaining her support for Castro.
“Julián is not a lightweight," she told Politico. "He can deliver a power punch and take one."

Texto completo: Elizabeth Warren got her first taste of front-runner status at the fourth Democratic primary debate — and the heat that goes along with it.
Her 11 rivals in Westerville, Ohio, on Tuesday night blasted the Massachusetts senator on her approaches to healthcare, taxes, and foreign policy, among a slew of other issues. The negative light they sought to shine on Warren, 70, reflects her steady rise in the polls over the past couple of months to now run even or ahead of former Vice President Joe Biden.
Democrats onstage at Otterbein University hit Warren over her “Medicare for all” plan from points across the ideological spectrum. Socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, returning to the campaign trail after a heart attack, called her idea a pale imitation of his own proposal, which would eliminate private health insurance in favor of government coverage. Other candidates questioned how Warren would pay for the broadening of coverage without raising taxes on middle-class Americans.
“I have made clear what my principles are here. Costs will go up for the wealthy and big corporations," Warren said during the most crowded debate in modern U.S. political history. “I will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle-class families."
South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg seized on her dodge, a move he foreshadowed ahead of the debate.
"A yes or no question that didn't get a yes or no answer,” Buttigieg said. “Your signature, senator, is to have a plan for everything, except for this.”
Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who has been ribbed for not dropping her Midwest “nice” facade, piled on.
"We need to be honest here and tell the American people where we’re going to send the invoice,” she said. "The difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something you can actually get done.”
Entrepreneur Andrew Yang took a swing at Warren over a past statement where she said blaming job losses on automation was “a good story, except it’s not really true.” Ohio, a state without which no Republican has won the White House since 1896, has suffered high rates of unemployment from a manufacturing downturn.
"Saying this is a rules problem is ignoring the reality that Americans see around us every single day,” Yang said, referring to her pitch for “big, structural change.”
On Warren’s “wealth tax" platform that would slug households with net worths of more than $50 million at 2% and billionaire households at 3%, former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke said she seemed “more focused on being punitive or pitting one part of the country against the other."
President Trump’s decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, which has allowed Turkey to launch a military offensive against Syrian Kurdish militias, also caused clashes among the candidates.
Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, a Hawaii National Guard major, pressed Warren on whether she would end the “regime change war” in the region, before defending herself against Buttigieg, the other veteran on stage. Gabbard has had to repeatedly fend off criticism of cozying up to the regime of Syrian strongman Bashar Assad, having met him in Damascus and cast doubt on credible reports of chemical weapons use on his own citizens.
The other notable squabble to break out that did not include Warren was between O’Rourke and Buttigieg over the former El Paso councilman’s mandatory assault rifle buyback proposal.
Biden, who received the most scrutiny during the previous three debates, escaped the same level of examination other than pointed questions at the top of the program over why he allowed his son Hunter Biden to accept a $50,000-a-month position on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company while he was the Obama administration’s point man in the country. The Bidens’ work in Ukraine has become central to a House Democrat-led impeachment inquiry into whether Trump improperly leveraged U.S. military aid to pressure Ukraine to dig up political dirt on the former vice president.
“Look, my son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong,” Biden said. “My son’s statement speaks for itself. What I think is important is we focus on why it's so important to remove this man from office.”
Biden insisted he never discussed Hunter Biden’s business interests, despite the younger Biden during an interview with ABC that aired earlier on Tuesday acknowledging the pair had a “brief exchange.”
New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker stood up for Biden, ripping the question as “so offensive” for undermining “a statesman.”
"I saw this play in 2016's election,” he said. “We are literally using Donald Trump's lies.”
While Tuesday exposed differences in the field, there was unity among the Democratic aspirants on the topic of impeachment.
California Sen. Kamala Harris accused Trump of being “the most corrupt and unpatriotic president we have ever had” and former Obama administration Housing Secretary Julián Castro claimed “a majority of Americans ... support removal.” The duo, who were responsible for fireworks at the June and September debates, had a quieter night.
But the most forceful impeachment response came from longtime impeachment advocate Tom Steyer, a hedge fund billionaire behind the “Need to Impeach” campaign who made his maiden debate appearance on Tuesday.
The three-hour debate covered a couple of areas unexplored during the past events, such as the health of the three septuagenarian candidates: Biden, Sanders, and Warren. Other subjects broached were abortion, anti-trust laws, and drug prices.
The White House hopefuls who qualify for the next debate by meeting its more stringent criteria will meet in Georgia on Nov. 20.

At the debate, 2020 Democrats fell into the Mitt Romney trap

Texto completo: The moment that took all of the air out of Mitt Romney's 2012 campaign was when, in a debate with President Barack Obama, he dug into a peripheral issue that he thought was safe: foreign policy.
Romney threw all of his weight at Obama over the relatively limited attack on a U.S. embassy that had resulted in the death of an American ambassador. It blew up in Romney's face when he demanded that Obama call the attack an incident of terror, only to be fact-checked by moderator Candy Crowley. She remembered that Obama had in fact referred to the event as an "act of terror."
All of that is boring and so beside the point of what's going on in the United States and yet Democrats are ready to repeat that same dumb mistake. Like Romney, Democrats running for the presidential nomination believe that talking about a safe topic — that is, a subject that won't hurt them with the national media or that President Trump can't grab them by the throat with — puts them on solid footing.
It doesn't put them on solid footing, and it actually puts all of us to sleep. At the primary debate on Tuesday, all of the Democrats said the same thing that war-hungry Republicans in Congress have been saying — that Trump did the wrong thing in declaring a pull-out of Syria.
The Kurds, the Kurds, the Kurds! Even the Democrats who explicitly claimed to support a pull-out — Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard — paid lip service to the idea that we had betrayed the Kurds!
But who are the Kurds? Is there a single Democratic voter sitting at home watching this and thinking to himself, "Thank God we got to the real subject close to my heart — the safety of the Kurds, our brethren 6,000 miles away"?
And what about independent voters?
I know the media care about this but, as with Libya, that's not going to decide the election.

Memo to Democrats: A wealth tax is unconstitutional

Texto completo: Democratic presidential candidates pushing a “wealth tax” are pushing policy that’s not only unwise, but almost certainly unconstitutional.
Article I, section 9 of the Constitution says that “no capitation, or other direct, tax shall be laid, unless in proportion to the census or enumeration herein before directed to be taken.” What this originally meant is that federal taxes could not be enacted directly on individuals as individuals, but only in proportion to the total population of each state.
The Sixteenth Amendment modified this original restriction, but only somewhat. It allowed for a tax on income. It did not, however, allow other direct taxes. By almost all understandings, a tax on assets is exactly the sort of “direct tax” prohibited by Article I, Section 9.
Liberal theorists in recent years have argued that this understanding of unconstitutionality is wrongheaded, but in doing so, they grasp at straws. Even they acknowledge that the most recent case that addressed this, Pollock v. Farmer’s Loan, goes against them. They just say the decision is wrong.
In other words, even though the ordinary language of the Constitution indicates that a wealth tax would be unconstitutional, and even though the relevant Supreme Court precedent says would it be unconstitutional, they want to construct a convoluted argument that the court is wrong and the Constitution doesn’t really mean what it says.
Sure, if a Democratic president gets into office and “packs” the Supreme Court, that president might be able to get a court majority to ignored the Constitution’s plain text. But if not even Franklin Roosevelt at the height of his popularity could succeed in packing the court, the likelihood is that no Democratic president could easily succeed at doing so in the 2020s.
In chasing “wealth,” Democrats are like those deluded people who still chase rainbows to find the leprechaun’s gold at the rainbow’s base. Worse even than fool’s gold, this is gold that doesn’t actually exist in any accessible way. These candidates are wasting their time — and ours.

Texto completo: Joe Biden said that he was motivated to run for president in part because President Trump has “ripped the soul out” of America.
In his final remarks during Tuesday’s Democratic presidential debate, the 76-year-old former vice president tore into the Trump presidency.
“That’s the reason why I’m running. We have to restore the soul of this country. That’s why I’m doing this,” Biden said. “In fact, this president has ripped the soul out of this country, divided us in ways that are absolutely outrageous."
“A liar, he cheats; he does not do anything to promote people generally,” Biden told the crowd.
Biden has attempted to leverage himself as the antithesis to Trump, describing the current administration as an “aberration.”
Trump has also hit Biden repeatedly since he began his candidacy, calling on foreign powers to investigate Biden and his son’s business dealings abroad.
A RealClearPolitics national average of polls has Biden leading his competitors by a 6-point spread, bringing in 29.4% support.

Tonight is the last stand for Beto and Kamala

Texto completo: With just more than 30 minutes to go until the CNN-New York Times debate, here's one major thing to look for this Tuesday night: the Beto-Kamala factor.
Early on, both of these candidates seemed promising. Harris was posting healthy double digits into the summer. Yet both candidates have fallen to the low single digits. And with the latest Quinnipiac University poll showing Harris on 4% and O'Rourke at 2%, both candidates need to stand apart tonight if they are to have any chance of building momentum toward the primaries.
To stand out, they will need a performance that makes Democratic primary voters reconsider their candidacies. Some moment that makes those voters stop, think, and say, "Actually, maybe I'm with her (or him)!"
What might that entail?
Well, I would suggest both candidates trying to do two things.
First, rising above the rest of the lower-ranking pack.
As Harris and O'Rourke address other second-tier candidates such as Tulsi Gabbard, Andrew Yang, Amy Klobuchar, and Pete Buttigieg, expect tenacity. The polling data suggests Democrats don't simply want a candidate they can believe in, but a candidate they believe can confidently beat Donald Trump in November 2020. That means aggression against challengers. Considering the continuing Turkish offensive against erstwhile U.S. allies in northern Syria, Gabbard is likely to come under particular pressure for her previous statements in support of Bashar Assad.
Second, expect Harris and O'Rourke to pick either Elizabeth Warren or Joe Biden and go after them.
These two will want to show primary voters that they have the better ideas, greater courage, and stronger will to win in 2020. And that means unseating the two candidates at the top of the pack. The key here is that we're now in October 2019. We're just 13 months away from the general election. The time for playing is over. Whether they admit it or not, Democratic primary voters are now beginning to consolidate in favor of their front-runners.
Harris and O'Rourke need to stand out tonight. If they don't, they can kiss their presidential aspirations goodbye.

Texto completo: Attention fans of "The Office:" a podcast is dropping that you may want to check out.
"Office Ladies" debut episode will be released Wednesday. The podcast features show star's Jenna Fischer and Angela Kinsey, Pam and Angela respectively, as they rewatch episodes of the iconic TV sitcom and take fans behind the scenes of good ole Dunder Mifflin.
In an interview with the New York Times, Fischer said they would keep the podcast going "as long as people are listening." "The Office" cast and crew members will be dropping in from time to time, as Kinsey said Rainn Wilson, who played fan favorite Dwight, makes a call-in appearance on the third episode, "Health Care."

The podcast, which has only dropped a three-minute teaser in its feed, is No. 8 on the Apple Podcasts chart in the United States, according to Chartable.
It has also earned a 4.8 / 5 star rating with over 7,300 ratings prior to releasing an episode.

11. For the kiddos: Cuddle + Kind dolls
Little ones will love snuggling up with a Cuddle + Kind doll this holiday season.

16. For the brunch addict: Dash Mini Waffle Maker
In the eyes of the brunch-goer on your list, waffles are great, but mini waffles are even better.

Plants, like people, are unique living beings who require a varying amount of care. Plant delivery service The Sill offers a range of live plants from grow pots to gorgeous ceramic holders any recipient would be proud to display, no matter how much they know about gardening.

Get a Live Plant Subscription from The Sill for $60 per month
Get the Petite White Orchid from The Sill for $75
20. For the person who likes their beauty sleep: Slip Silk Pillowcase
Friction between your hair and a regular cotton or polyester pillowcase can cause damage and breakage.

The Silk Pillowcase from Slip comes in a queen and king size, as well as a variety of colors to suit your recipient's style.
Get the Slip Silk Pillowcase from Nordstrom from $89
21. For the one who enjoys a hot cuppa: Manatea Tea Infuser
We tested a bunch of loose tea infusers earlier this year in search of the best one. We were pleasantly surprised to find that this whimsical silicone manatee (or, rather, Manatea) came out on top, due to its tight-gripping fins and great steeping timing. Those factors, combined with its adorable anthropomorphic shape, will be sure to please any tea drinker in your life.
Get the Manatea Silicone Tea Infuser from Amazon for $9.90
22. For the one who enjoys the finer things in life: Tapas and Cheese Board

Get the Tapas and Cheese Board at Uncommon Goods for $85
23. For the person who prioritizes self-care: Dr. Jart+ Face Masks and Japanese washcloths
Self care-focused gifts are never a bad idea—especially when they contain this weird-but-fun “rubber” mask and these surprisingly useful Japanese washcloths. The rubber mask has a pretty shocking, almost Hannibal Lecter-esque look when you put it on, so it’s perfect for that friend who loves taking selfies in sheet masks, but it’s also genuinely effective for reinvigorating the skin. The washcloths are a cult favorite of Amazon reviewers (and our audience manager), due to their ability to exfoliate to the extreme without drying out the skin or soaking up bacteria like a loofah.
Get the Dr. Jart+ Cryo Rubber Mask from Sephora from $14
Get the Salux Japanese Nylon Washcloths from Amazon for $12.25

Candidates find war chest gold in Seattle and surrounding areas Battle for hearts, wallets

Texto completo: When it comes to campaign contributions from Washington, presidential candidates are likely to follow the advice of notorious bank robber Willie Sutton, and go where the money is.
For most of the leading Democratic candidates still in the race, that's ZIP code 98112, a small area of Seattle south of the University of Washington from the western edge of Lake Washington to the east side of Capitol Hill.
A computer analysis of Federal Election Commission reports by The Spokesman-Review shows that former Vice President Joe Biden; South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg; Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren; New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker; and entrepreneur Andrew Yang all had their best fundraising success from addresses in that ZIP code through the first half of 2019. As a group, they've raised more than $150,000 from donors in that area.
Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has received the most money from a nearby Seattle ZIP code, 98103, which includes the Green Lake, Woodland Park and Fremont neighborhoods.
President Donald Trump's most lucrative ZIP code so far is in Camas, Washington, a city east of Vancouver, thanks in part to donations totaling the maximum of $5,600 each from the president of an investment firm and his wife.
But Trump, like many of his would-be Democratic opponents, has his second biggest contribution total from the Mercer Island ZIP code, which is home to some of the state's most expensive residences.
Except for Jay Inslee, who had what many would call a home field advantage, Trump has raised more campaign money from Washington donors than any Democratic presidential candidate, and has outraised even Inslee in Spokane County.
But the Democrats preparing for tonight's debate have, as a group, raised more than Trump in the state and the county through the first half of 2019.
FEC reports show Trump has raised nearly $704,000 from Washington state for his 2020 re-election campaign. He collected more than $49,000 of that from donors living in Spokane-area ZIP codes. His most lucrative local ZIP code thus far, where he collected some $7,700, is 99224, which includes the West Plains between the Spokane city limits and Airway Heights, and suburban areas along U.S. Highway 195 south of the city.
Inslee, a two-term Washington governor who recently abandoned his presidential campaign to seek re-election, raised more than twice that statewide, nearly $1.8 million in his 51/2 month run. But he received only $16,300 from Spokane ZIP codes, and trailed Sanders for local financial support.
Of the more than $3.3 million contributed to presidential candidates still in the race from Washington addresses, about $1.2 million comes from Seattle. Although the state has been reliably Democratic in presidential races since 1988, candidates of both parties for years have visited the city and its nearby cities to feed their campaign coffers.
The Spokane area has not been a major source of presidential campaign donations, and the most current FEC records available don't suggest that will change. Washington's top 27 postal areas for presidential campaign contributions are in Seattle or nearby King County communities; the first total for a Spokane ZIP code - downtown's 99201 - shows up at 63rd. Most of the $11,000 from those addresses has gone to Democrats.
The South Hill ZIP code of 99203 is not far behind, with about $10,000 in contributions to all candidates, about $7,000 of it going to Democrats.
Except for Inslee's total, statewide financial support for the Democrats still campaigning is similar to the most recent national polling results.
Biden is in the lead, with more than $531,000 in contributions from around the state. Sanders is second, with nearly $448,900, Warren is a close third with $423,000 and Buttigieg is fourth with almost $375,000.
Sanders, Warren and Buttigieg all received more donations from Spokane County than Biden, however.
California Sen. Kamala Harris is fifth statewide with nearly $243,000, Booker sixth with nearly $125,000 and Yang seventh at nearly $106,500. Former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii and former HUD Secretary Julian Castro are all below $100,000 in donations from Washington residents. Reports for billionaire Tom Steyer, who joined the campaign in July, aren't yet posted.
Candidate reports for the third quarter of the year were due at the beginning of the month and are expected to posted later in October.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – The candidates vying for the Democratic nomination will face off Tuesday night during the party’s October primary debate on the biggest stage yet.
Having 12 candidates appearing on one stage together makes Tuesday’s debate the biggest presidential primary debate in recorded political history, The New York Times reports.
Here are four questions answered about Tuesday's democratic debate:
How to watch?
This will be the Democratic National Committee's fourth debate. It will be held at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio, by CNN and The New York Times, airing live at 8 p. m. EST.
Viewers can watch the debate on CNN, CNN International, CNN en Español, and it can be streamed through both CNN’s and the New York Times' websites.
It will additionally be available across mobile devices via CNN and The New York Timess apps for iOS and Android, via CNNgo apps for Apple TV, Roku, Amazon Fire, Chromecast and Android TV; SiriusXM Channels 116, 454, 795, the Westwood One Radio Network and National Public Radio.
CNN's Erin Burnett and Anderson Cooper and the New York Times' Marc Lacey will moderate.

Who is debating?
The following candidates will appear on stage together in this order:
Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii
Tom Steyer, billionaire and activist
Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey
Sen. Kamala Harris of California
Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont
Former Vice President Joe Biden
Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts
South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg
Andrew Yang, entrepreneur
Former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas
Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota
Former HUD Secretary Julián Castro

More: How do Democrats win in 2020? These battleground state leaders have some advice.
The stage placement represents how candidates are polling. It has become a three-way race leading into the October match-up as Biden, Warren, and Sanders are consistently polling in the top three, and they will be center stage for the second debate in a row.
Gabbard and Steyer are additions to this stage from the September debate, where 10 candidates faced off.
Gabbard also said Monday that she does plan to attend the debate after she had previously considered boycotting what she claimed was "a serious threat to our democracy" by the Democratic National Committee and the media.
I will be attending the debate.

Sanders is also planning on appearing after canceling several campaign events following a heart attack and procedure a few weeks ago. The senator had two stents inserted, but recently said that he's "going to get back into the groove of a very vigorous campaign. "
Democratic debate: Democratic debate: Who were the winners and losers
What are the issues?
This will be the first time the top democratic candidates have been together on one stage since the impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump was announced in late September by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and that subject could dominate some of the discussion as every candidate has now supported the inquiry.
This comes at the same time Steyer will be looking to make waves during his first appearance on the debate stage, and he has been making the case for impeachment for years.
It may also add pressure to Biden, who has been a consistent front-runner for the nomination, as the inquiry puts his family at the center of the investigation into the president's dealings with Ukraine.
The candidates may also address Trump's decision to pull back U. S. forces from northern Syria. This move potentially enables a resurgence of the Islamic State as Turkey prepares a military assault against Kurdish fighters who helped the U. S. battle the Islamic State. The president faces widespread backlash for "abandoning" a U. S. ally.
Other topics that could dominate the night include gun control and safety, immigration, LGBTQ rights and health care.

Who will not be on stage?
For October, candidates needed to reach 2% in at least four recognized polls and receive donations from at least 130,000 individuals.
And despite this being the largest primary debate, there are still a few candidates who will not be gracing the stage.
These include:
Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado
Montana Gov. Steve Bullock
Former Rep. John Delaney of Maryland
Miramar, Fla. , Mayor Wayne Messam
Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan
Former Rep. Joe Sestak of Pennsylvania
Author and activist Marianne Williamson
The DNC recently released more difficult requirements candidates must meet to qualify for the November debates, setting up the possibility that several additional candidates may miss the stage compared to the October match-up, potentially ending some campaigns.

Trump tweets rather than condemn violent video

Texto completo: President Trump hasn't come across the mocked-up video of him on a murderous rampage against journalists and political opponents?
How absurd.
The president's press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, said Monday morning that her boss hadn't seen the video widely circulated since Sunday but that "based upon everything he has heard, he strongly condemns this video."
What a relief, right?
It's good to know the president at some point intends to censure the horrific video depicting him inside a church shooting journalists and political rivals like the late Sen. John McCain, Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Sen. Mitt Romney.
But first he had more important things to tweet Monday morning, like urging Americans to vote for his former press aide Sean Spicer on "Dancing with the Stars."
It increasingly feels futile to call on Trump, his core supporters and the conservatives who otherwise carry the Republican Party's moral torch to denounce evil.
They're simply tone-deaf, too worried about protecting their own fortunes, their elected gigs or too consumed helping Trump isolating this country from the rest of the world to burden themselves with a video that could incite violence against fellow Americans.
But this is no joke, and the rest of America should collectively denounce the grotesque video, which was reportedly produced in 2018 but shown last week at a Trump meeting at his Miami resort.
The video, reported by The New York Times over the weekend, shows a Trump-like figure inside a church striking McCain and journalists at a time when mass shootings in America are too real, too raw to stomach.
"Thinking this video somehow will incite violence against media brands is no different than thinking Joker will lead to mass shootings or heavy metal music leads to satanic suicides or video games create mass shooters. It's a meme, and it's free speech," said commentator Stephen Miller on Twitter.
McCain's daughter, Meghan McCain, shot back saying on Twitter: "This video is disgusting and disturbing and any human with any moral clarity sees that."
That's the thing, though. A human needs to have "moral clarity" to see the evil of depicting the nation's commander-in-chief executing a mass shooting against fellow Americans.

Democratic candidates focus on Trump, issues facing Ohio

Texto completo: COLUMBUS – It's debate week in Ohio. And national Democrats want you to know they're not going to abandon the state when it's over.
Today, 12 Democratic presidential hopefuls will debate in the Columbus suburb Westerville. The location is said to represent Democrats' inroads in the suburbs and its commitment to campaign in the state that Donald Trump won in 2016 by 8 points.
Issues such as Medicare for all and the Green New Deal have dominated the national narrative around the Democratic primary. But they were near absent during the Ohio Democratic Party's state dinner Sunday.
Instead, party officials and a handful of 2020 presidential candidates addressing the crowd spent much of their time attacking Trump, pledging to address climate change and urging action on gun control and the opiate addiction crisis.
The five candidates – who have polled in single digits in recent weeks – delivered messages tailored to Ohio.
Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar stressed her ability to win Republican-leaning areas. South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg likened the Trump presidency to a TV show, and in a few short months, "You get to pick up the remote and change the channel to something better."
Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan said Democrats shouldn't be afraid to voice support for labor unions. Businessman Tom Steyer noted a recent spate of overdose deaths in the county. Businessman Andrew Yang started his speech with a stat about manufacturing automation correlating with support for Trump.
"It's been an interesting campaign to be a candidate from Ohio because it seems like it's all happening here," said Ryan, the only candidate of the five who won't be on the debate stage Tuesday.
More than 25,000 people requested free tickets to the debate from the party; only a few hundred were available.
The state and national party organized events across the state before and after the debate. Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez will meet General Motors workers on strike in West Chester, farmers in central Ohio and gun violence survivors in Dayton. Candidates extended their stay by a few days to campaign here.
Republicans have painted the Democratic field as too far left and out-of-touch with most voters, especially Ohioans who elected Trump in 2016.
"From supporting a bogus impeachment witch hunt, to advocating for failed socialist policies, the Democrats' radical agenda is taking center stage in Ohio," Republican National Committee spokeswoman Mandi Merritt said in a statement. "But no matter the candidate, not one 2020 wannabe will stack up to President Trump's record of success in the Buckeye State."
Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper refuted that idea, saying Democrats are with the mainstream on big issues such as health care, guns and climate change.
"They want to keep the Affordable Care Act, expand it, do better – others want to go further. It's a debate between how do we broaden access," Pepper told reporters before the dinner.
"Donald Trump and the Republicans want to get rid of the Affordable Care Act entirely."
Perez said the party will invest in Ohio because he thinks Democrats can win here. The message, he said, is simple: "We have your back on the issues that matter most."
CNN will host the Oct. 15 debate with The New York Times.

Impeachment, Biden and septuagenarians

Texto completo: Despite a crush of news that would seem to affect the Democratic presidential race, the candidates appear to be running in place. The buzz is fading. Yes, Sen. Elizabeth Warren inched up in the polls, and a few marginal candidates have dropped out, but, for the most part, little has changed since Iowa farmers planted their corn last spring.
Three Democratic debates have not changed the big picture, but with actual primary voting beginning just 111 days after the fourth debate, and with many new topics to discuss, things could play differently tonight on CNN.
Hard as it is to believe, the word "impeachment" was never spoken in the Democratic debate on Sept. 12. This time, it's likely to be the first topic brought up. Of course, all the Democrats who will be on stage in Westerville, Ohio, now support the impeachment effort -- with former Vice President Joe Biden adding his voice last week. "To preserve our Constitution, our democracy and our basic integrity," Biden said, Trump "should be impeached." He added that the president has basically "indicted himself."
But it won't do any good to hear everyone echo Biden's words and pledge support for the House's impeachment investigation, nor will it help voters to hear each candidate blast the bad behavior of President Donald Trump and his henchmen.
It would, however, be meaningful to find out which candidates favor prosecuting Trump after he leaves office, and who among them believes guidelines that prohibit indicting a sitting president should be changed.
It might be worthwhile to ask candidates whether they fear that a party-line impeachment vote will energize Republicans in the 2020 campaign.
How to handle delicate matters
The impeachment issue will open the door to questions about Biden's son Hunter and the large sums he earned serving on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company. To be clear, no matter how many ugly tweets Trump sends out, there is no proof that Biden or his son broke any laws. Yet, the cosmetics of Hunter Biden's business dealings are unattractive. Will anyone on the debate stage go after the former vice president's son? In previous debates, some have attacked Biden's record concerning civil rights. Will his son's situation be off limits?
How will moderators from CNN and The New York Times handle this highly delicate matter?
Sen. Bernie Sanders, 78, will take his place on the debate stage, presumably looking no worse for the wear after suffering a heart attack Oct. 1. The other candidates and moderators will immediately face a predicament similar to that involving Biden's son: Is Sanders' health and age fair game?
In fact, Sanders will undoubtedly address his health whether asked about it or not. In a seven-minute video statement last Thursday, Sanders wisely sought to turn the negative of his heart condition into a positive regarding the importance, as he sees it, of "Medicare for All."
He said that lying in a Las Vegas hospital "made me feel even more strongly the need for us to continue our efforts to end this dysfunctional and cruel health care system."
Medical care and insurance aside, Sanders' health emergency has reopened discussion about his fitness to serve as president well into his 80s, as well as the broader question of age for all the septuagenarian candidates -- Warren (70), Trump (73), Biden (76), and Sanders (78). Fact is, it was a legitimate issue even before Sanders was stricken. Voters and commentators tend to dwell on how vigorous and fit a candidate seems rather than focusing on the odds of medical complications and diminished faculties that are simply a part of aging.
Will moderators challenge the older candidates on the age issue? And will any of the younger candidates dare to make age part of the debate?
Since the last debate, Warren has improved her position in most national polls and now finds herself neck and neck with Biden. To date, the top three Democratic candidates -- Warren, Biden and Sanders -- have been gentle with each other on the debate stage. Is Biden's slump in both polling and fundraising enough to make him more aggressive this time? And will other candidates now go after Warren as she nears front-runner status?
From fighter to healing leader
Although Trump's base -- energized by prime-time hosts on Fox News -- won't concede it, his presidency is unraveling. Whether that results in impeachment by the House and a trial in the Senate, it is damaging Trump's reelection prospects.
At what point does that necessitate a shift by Democratic candidates? The more Trump does to defeat himself, the less Democrats need to flog an anti-Trump theme and the more they will need to find the best candidate to bring the nation together.
The early months of the campaign were focused on finding a fighter -- someone who could go toe-to-toe with Trump. The greater need now might be to elect a healer -- a new president who can somehow repair the political and social disagreements that are ripping the nation apart. Will that Democrat emerge on the stage in Ohio?
My fear is no, but my hope is yes.

ELECTION 2020; Fourth Democratic debate; Biden may face questions on Ukraine. But will his rivals raise the subject?

Texto completo: The impeachment investigation of President Trump has dramatically changed the campaign landscape for the Democratic presidential candidates who will gather Tuesday in Ohio for their fourth debate.
The uproar over Trump asking the president of Ukraine to investigate his potential 2020 opponent Joe Biden has drawn attention away from every other Democrat in the race. And the candidates' attempts to stay focused on healthcare, immigration, guns and other issues have been largely drowned out by the impeachment media storm and raging controversy over Trump's foreign policy.
That could change, at least briefly, at the CNN/New York Times debate Tuesday in Westerville, Ohio. Here are seven things to watch:

--
Will Biden face pressure on Ukraine?
Trump and his allies have been hurling unsubstantiated allegations that Biden, when he was vice president, pushed Ukraine to fire a top prosecutor in an effort to protect his son Hunter Biden, who was serving on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.
In a July phone call, Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the Bidens -- shortly after suspending nearly $400 million in U.S. aid to Ukraine for its fight against Russia-backed separatists.
Numerous Ukrainian officials have said there is no evidence to support Trump's claim. A probe of the gas company had nothing to do with Hunter Biden, they said, and had gone dormant when the Obama administration pushed for the prosecutor's ouster because of his failure to go after corruption.
Still, Biden has refused to say why he saw no conflict in his son's paid position on the gas company board when the vice president was the Obama administration's point man for fighting corruption in Ukraine. With Democrats nearly united in the drive to impeach Trump, it would be delicate for one of Biden's rivals to raise the topic of whether his son's Ukraine work posed at least the appearance of a conflict. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker has suggested that kind of attack would serve as a gift to Trump.
But debate moderators might not let Biden easily deflect questions about his son the way he has so far -- by going on the attack against Trump for inviting foreign interference in the 2020 election.
Hunter Biden agreed Sunday not to work for any foreign-owned companies if his father is elected president.
--
How will the candidates stack up on foreign affairs?
The chaos and violence that followed Trump's abandonment of America's Kurdish allies in Syria last week, apparently at the bidding of Turkey's president, have pushed foreign affairs to the top of the campaign agenda.
Trump's Ukraine scandal and the giant Hong Kong protests against the Chinese government could further test the candidates' dexterity with complex challenges overseas, an area little explored in previous debates.
For Biden, it's a chance to show the expertise he developed over eight years as vice president and 36 years as a U.S. senator, including two as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee.
The current and former members of Congress onstage have varying degrees of experience in foreign policy. But for those with little or none -- South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former Housing Secretary Julian Castro, San Francisco billionaire Tom Steyer and New York businessman Andrew Yang -- questions about troubles abroad will carry an especially high risk if they're unprepared to respond.

How will those in the back of the pack try to vault ahead?
Most of the 12 candidates onstage are stuck below 3% in the polls, so they're in danger of not qualifying for the party's increasingly stringent criteria for inclusion in future debates. That gives them an incentive to go on the attack.
California Sen. Kamala Harris, Castro and Booker have all gone after Biden in previous debates, with varying success. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii assailed Harris with scathing criticism of her record as a prosecutor.
With time running out, will Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar target Biden in a bid for moderate voters?
Will Steyer, a first-time candidate for public office who will be onstage for the first time at a Democratic debate, try to advance himself by tearing down one of his opponents?
--
Are the leading contenders ready to rumble?
For months, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has honored a peace pact with Warren, his leading rival for the support of progressives.
But Sanders' poll numbers have been sliding as Warren's have been rising, and he's signaled he's ready to point out their differences.
"Elizabeth, I think, as you know, has said that she is a capitalist through her bones. I'm not," he told ABC News on Sunday.
Biden too has started to point out contrasts with Warren. At a recent fundraiser, he described himself as someone with "a proven ability to get things done," then took an apparent swipe at Warren's penchant for releasing a wide array of lengthy plans for her presidency. "We're not electing a planner," he said.
--
What's the impact of Sanders' recent heart attack?
The 78-year-old had to suspend his public events after suffering a heart attack early this month in Las Vegas. Many debate viewers will be watching Sanders' energy level on Tuesday to assess his fitness to be commander in chief.
The senator's health-related detour from the campaign trail could also draw new scrutiny to the other septuagenarians in the race: Biden and Warren, as well as Trump.
In a September debate, Castro appeared to question the mental acuity of Biden, who will turn 77 in November, by falsely accusing him of forgetting a comment on healthcare that he'd made a few minutes before. The attack backfired, earning Castro a heap of criticism.
The next oldest Democratic candidate, Warren, who at 70 is three years younger than Trump, frequently puts her vigor on display by jogging into rallies.
Still, the presence on the debate stage of several younger candidates -- Buttigieg is 37; Gabbard is 38; Castro, 45; and former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas, 47 -- will inevitably highlight the age of their older rivals.
--
Can Harris and Buttigieg escape the mid-tier doldrums?
Harris has been one of the most uneven performers in the debates so far. She surged upward in the polls after confronting Biden in the first debate over his opposition to busing to desegregate schools in the 1970s.
But she had trouble explaining her healthcare plan in the next debate, and Warren has overtaken her as the top woman in the race. Harris tried to contrast herself with Trump in the September debate, but still failed to gain traction. Buttigieg, one of the top fundraisers in the field, impressed many Democrats early on as a young, erudite, gay war veteran.
He is relatively popular in Iowa, which holds the party's first presidential nominating contest on Feb. 3, but he has had trouble building support among African Americans, a crucial Democratic constituency. Like the lower-tier candidates, both Buttigieg and Harris face intense pressure to find a breakaway moment. Buttigieg has taken shots, albeit mild ones, at Warren and O'Rourke in recent days.
--
Will Warren be forced to say how she would pay for "Medicare for all"?
Warren was asked directly in the September debate whether middle-class taxes would rise if she's able to fulfill her promise to offer Medicare to all Americans. America's richest individuals and biggest corporations will pay more, she responded, and middle-class families will pay less.
Asked once again if middle-class taxes would rise, Warren sidestepped the question again, saying the "total cost" would drop for "hard-working families."
Republicans see a Democratic nominee who backs higher taxes for the middle class as a gift to Trump. So Warren's response, if the question arises again, could matter a lot.

Texto completo: Benefits of dog ownership may be particularly pronounced in those who have already had a heart attack.
People who own dogs live longer, a new review of studies suggests. And the benefits may be particularly pronounced in those who have already had a heart attack or other serious heart problems.
Dog ownership has been associated with a decrease in the risk of cardiovascular disease, but until now studies of its effect on mortality have produced mixed results.
For this analysis, published in Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes, researchers pooled data from 10 studies that included 3,837,005 people. There were 530,515 deaths over an average of 10 years' follow-up.
The researchers found that compared with people who do not own dogs, those who do have a 24 percent lower risk of death at any given age, and a 31 percent lower risk of death from cardiovascular disease. Among people who already had serious heart problems, dog owners had a 65 percent lower mortality rate than those who didn't own a dog.
The investigators suggest that the advantage could come from the extra exercise involved in dog ownership, and possibly from beneficial psychological effects as well.
The lead author, Dr. Caroline K. Kramer, an endocrinologist at the University of Toronto, said that the studies were observational and do not prove cause and effect.
But, she said, "Look at all the benefits of having a dog -- cardiovascular advantages, reduced symptoms of depression, lower blood pressure, and the striking association for people who have already had cardiovascular disease, which is really significant."

Embracing the ‘Streetcar’ challenge

Texto completo: Few American plays are more famous than Tennessee Williams’ “A Streetcar Named Desire.”
Chalk it up to its raw sexuality, tragic plot, poetic language and larger than life characters.
Oh, and Marlon Brando, who was just 23 and a virtual unknown when he originated the role of Stanley Kowalski on Broadway in 1947 and followed that up by burning up the screen in the 1951 film. Others who have essayed the role include Gary Sinise, Christopher Walken and Alec Baldwin.
The actresses who portrayed Blanche, the fading Southern belle Stanley destroys, left their marks as well, starting with Jessica Tandy, who played opposite Brando on Broadway, and Vivien Leigh, who starred in the film. Their successors include Glenn Close, Tallulah Bankhead and Jessica Lange.
J. Barry Lewis, who directs the production that opened Palm Beach Dramaworks’ season Friday in West Palm Beach, is well aware of the play’s star-studded legacy.
“It’s like any great book or play that we carry in our minds,” he said. “Blanche and Stanley are so well known it’s almost as if they existed. It’s a challenge to throw off that mantle and still embrace Williams’ story and make it our own.”
Kathy McCafferty has wanted to play Blanche for a long time. Her first and only role in a Williams play — Laura in a college production of “The Glass Menagerie” — left an indelible impression.
“It was my first experience of being completely overtaken by a work,” she said. “It was the first time I felt I could completely let go in a performance.”
As Dramaworks’ Blanche, she has resolved to banish the ghosts of past Blanches.
“Everyone has ideas about who this character is,” she said. “I have to find who she is in me in response to Danny Gavigan’s Stanley and Annie
Grier’s Stella.”
In the play, Blanche arrives unannounced at sister Stella’s dingy apartment in New Orleans’ French Quarter, looking for shelter after her family has lost its ancestral home and fortune.
More comfortable with fantasy than reality, Blanche immediately clashes with Stanley, Stella’s working class husband, who resolves to unmask her. Rather than standing up for Blanche, Stella chooses her abusive husband over her fragile sister.
More than 70 years after its Broadway debut, the play, which won a Pulitzer Prize in 1948, remains current, Lewis said.
“The play has much to do with the fragility of life and how we see ourselves and project ourselves into worlds that are unknown or dangerous,” he said. “We want to feel safe and protected.”
People still struggle with isolation, loneliness, desertion, failure, rape, domestic abuse and the need to connect with others, he said.
McCafferty adds the diminished value society accords women as they age.
In the play, Blanche marvels that the assets she’s acquired with age, such as beauty of mind, richness of spirit and tenderness of heart, carry less weight than the loss of her physical beauty.
“I think a lot of women over 40 feel that,” McCafferty said.
Many scholars see Blanche as Williams’ voice. Like Blanche, the playwright struggled with alcoholism, sexuality, a dysfunctional family and feelings of being an outcast.
Blanche travels to the Kowalskis’ home on streetcars named Desire and Cemetery — a route that symbolizes the opposition between desire, which Blanche clings to, and death, which looms in the background.
In an essay published in The New York Times shortly before “Streetcar” opened on Broadway, Williams urged readers to “live - live” because time is short and “the mono syllable of the clock is Loss, Loss, Loss.”
McCafferty sees the play as “a cry for compassion and understanding” that requires its tragic climax to make its point.
“Streetcar” is a big enough play to admit many interpretations, Lewis said. Regardless of the versions audience members have seen before “we hope they come in ready for a rip-roaring story,” he said.

'He's not our boss': Fox News anchors trash Trump in meeting with advertisers

Texto completo: Multiple Fox News anchors were quick to disparage President Trump during a meeting with advertisers.
Some of the network's news hosts including Bret Baier, Martha MacCallum, and Chris Wallace addressed advertisers in Manhattan to assuage concerns that the president controls the network.
“Contrary to the opinion of some people, he’s not our boss,” MacCallum stated, according to the New York Times, while pointing out the president's attacks against the network for airing interviews with Democratic presidential candidates. “It is kind of shocking to hear that he really — that’s the way he thinks about how we should cover the election.”
During the meeting, Wallace brought up the president's frequent criticism of him: that he isn't his father, former 60 Minutes correspondent Mike Wallace.
“He often likes to say about me, ‘You know, I was covered by Mike Wallace, I liked him much more,’” the Fox News anchor told the advertisers. “To which my reaction is always: One of us has a daddy problem, and it’s not me.”
Trump echoed that sentiment about Wallace in a Sunday evening tweet explaining that he "will never be his father."

Tweet
The president has a rocky relationship with the conservative-leaning network. He often times praises the prime-time opinion hosts such as Sean Hannity, Laura Ingraham, and Tucker Carlson. Occasionally, he praises the hosts of Fox & Friends but did hit Brian Kilmeade on Twitter Monday morning. He also frequently criticizes some of the news anchors and some of the more liberal commentators.

That Trump meme video is atrocious, but it's neither incitement nor his fault

Texto completo: The media found a new justification for apoplexy on Sunday evening with the revelation that a pro-Trump group shared a creepy meme video at a Trump property.
The video was a clip modified from a 2014 dark comedy film. It superimposed the president's head onto a gunman opening fire on what was turned into the "Church of Fake News." This was played as a part of a "meme exhibit" for the pro-Trump event, and it reportedly went mostly unnoticed until a disturbed attendee sent a recording of it to the New York Times.
Trump himself had no role in making or platforming the video at the event, which he did not attend. White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham claims the president, who had no prior knowledge of the video, condemns it.
Tweet
That didn't stop, warranted or not, a full-scale media meltdown.
TweetTweetTweet
There's no question that the video's message on its face — the leader of the free world murdering members of the Fourth Estate — is abhorrent. But anyone can make a meme, and even the worst memes aren't necessarily taken seriously by anyone who makes let alone views them. Just because an anonymous Trump supporter made the macabre video doesn't mean that any member of the administration endorsed or enabled it, and furthermore, deplorable content can be responsible for raising the temperature of our civil discourse to dangerous heights without remotely constituting a threat in and of itself.
The media have already chosen to spin the video as a product of Trump himself. But even Trump's inappropriate mockery and vilification of the media is a very far cry from actual calls to violence. Trump deserves condemnation for trying to control the free press from his Twitter account, but he's not prosecuting up or spying on journalists, as his predecessor did.
Moreover, the instant leap to blaming Trump for demonstrations and literal acts of violence ignores a vital truth in politics: A politician's words can be both despicable and not responsible for how followers react. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has spent half a century blaming the wealthy and Republicans for the woes of ordinary Americans. Just because his rhetoric is irresponsible overall didn't make him responsible when his fanatical supporter, James Hodgkinson, took it upon himself to attempt to assassinate an entire baseball field's worth of congressional Republicans two years ago.
CNN's Brian Stelter is correct to be upset about the video's message. But the idea that journalists are in immediate and actual danger of facing violence in the Trump era is unfounded (Ben Jacobs notwithstanding), and this attempt to blame it on Trump is even more baseless.

Texto completo: The time is the early 1980s. The place is the South China Sea. A sailor aboard the U.S.S. Midway, an aircraft carrier, spots a leaky boat jammed with people fleeing tyranny in Indochina. As he helps bring the desperate refugees to safety, one of them calls out: “Hello, American sailor — Hello, Freedom Man.”
It’s the sort of story Americans used to like hearing about themselves. So much so, in fact, that Ronald Reagan told it in his 1989 farewell address, by way of underscoring how much went right for the United States when, as he put it, “We stood, again, for freedom.”
Not anymore. When the world looks at the United States today, it sings a sorry song. Goodbye America. Goodbye, Freedom Man.
That’s the global lesson from the regional catastrophe that is Donald Trump’s retreat in Syria. The president made his case, as he usually does, in a series of tweets this week. Like their author, the tweets were, by turns, sophomoric and self-important, flippant and destructive.
He praised the Kurds as “special people and wonderful fighters” who “in no way have we Abandoned” — and yet he abandoned them.
He praised Turkey for being “good to deal with” and “an important member in good standing of NATO” — after warning that he would “totally destroy and obliterate” its economy if it did anything he didn’t like.
He boasted that “The stupid endless wars, for us, are ending!” — but took the one step most likely to speed their resumption and expansion.
And he congratulated himself for his “great and unmatched wisdom.” Of course.
Closer to the mark in assessing the results of American withdrawal was Javad Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister, who said of the U.S. that it was “futile to seek its permission or rely on it for security.”
To survive the Turkish onslaught, the Kurdish forces we have cavalierly betrayed will now have little choice except to try to reach an accommodation with Bashar Assad. This will allow the Damascene dictator to consolidate his grip on the country he has brutalized for nearly 20 years — demonstrating to autocrats everywhere that using sarin gas, barrel bombs, hunger blockades, and every other barbaric method against defenseless civilians pays.
It will do worse than that.
It will put thousands of Kurdish lives in jeopardy. It will deepen Tehran’s influence in Syria. It will increase the likelihood of all-out war between Israel and Iran. It will underscore the inefficacy of U.S. sanctions to curb Tehran’s ambitions. It will ratify the wisdom of Vladimir Putin’s decision to intervene on Assad’s behalf. It will strengthen Turkish strongman Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s hand, not only in northern Syria but also in Turkish politics, just as he was finally beginning to experience serious reversals after 16 years in power.
And it will fundamentally jeopardize the gains made against the Islamic State, around 10,000 of whose fighters are in the custody of the Kurdish forces now being attacked. As Mazloum Abdi, the commander of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, told Bloomberg’s Eli Lake, “If we think the Turkish operation will not stop, we cannot fight ISIS anymore.”
Trump thus repeats Barack Obama’s mistake in Iraq of declaring success, pulling out, and creating the security and political vacuums which ISIS, Iran, and other bad actors were quick to fill. That alone should have been enough to dissuade this president from pursuing his course.
Except that Trump’s instinctive need to appease dictators appears to be even more powerful than his aversion to imitating his predecessor. Distracting attention from impeachment surely played a role, too, based on the view that ending “stupid endless wars” is generally a political winner — at least until the consequences of our geopolitical fecklessness are again felt fatally at home.
All of which makes it noteworthy that Trump’s Kurdish betrayal has elicited such a political backlash, including among some of his more reliable lackeys in the Republican caucus. People like Sen. Lindsey Graham understand that what the U.S. is now doing isn’t simply foreign policy folly. It’s a national disgrace.
It’s a signal that Americans are the friends you never want: there for you when, and only when, it’s convenient for them. It’s evidence that our moral values are tissue paper around the glass fragments of our president’s ego. It’s proof that the idealism that stormed Normandy, fed Europe, democratized Japan, and kept West Berlin free belongs to an increasingly remote past.
It means that American sailor or soldier seen on the horizon is no longer “freedom man.” He’s fair-weather friend.
Even now, this is not how most Americans, including many of Trump’s supporters, would wish to see themselves. People on their way to the bottom have their occasional moments of clarity, seldom seized. In the Syria debacle, Republicans have a chance to see, if not save, themselves.

Texto completo: After a violent video depicting President Donald Trump on a murder rampage against members of the media and political opponents was shown during a conference at a Trump resort, the people "killed" in the video have called on him to denounce it.
It's an edited version of the film "Kingsman: The Secret Service," featuring a church massacre scene. In the video, Trump's face is superimposed over the body of a shooter who brutally attacks and kills congregation members with faces of media organization logos and critics.
The White House said Monday morning that Trump had not yet seen the video but would see it soon. Based on what he had heard, though, he strongly condemned it.
More: Fake video of Trump shooting media and political opponents shown at conference, according to report
Here's what we know so far about the video and how it ended up being played in a room at Trump's Miami-based resort during a conference put on by a pro-Trump group.
Where did the video come from?
The group TheGeekzTeam is a pro-Trump meme video generator with nearly 20,000 YouTube subscribers.
Its Youtube page has several videos featuring Trump violently attacking Democrats and media organizations. In a similar one, musician and actor Donald Glover's music video for the song "This is America" is spoofed to again show Trump shooting members of the media.
The first existence of the "Kingsman" video appears to be in a YouTube upload from the meme group in July 2018, which was also tweeted out at the same time.
The caption of the video reads, "Fake News is very real and very present. Even through all the hate thats thrown at Trump daily, he still wants to help this nation back on it's feet and make it great again!"
How did the video end up at the conference?
The American Priority conference organizer, Alex Phillips, says organizers were not aware of the video and did not approve its usage at the event. Phillips said it was part of a "meme exhibit" that was played in a "side room" and submitted by third parties.
The conference agenda did include a breakout session called "Memetics. "
Phillips said the first time organizers were aware of the meme was when The New York Times, which first reported on the video, contacted them. Phillips told The Times that "this matter is under review. "
The Times said that it obtained footage of the clip being played at the conference by an attendee, who passed it onto an intermediary, who then sent it to a reporter.
“American Priority rejects all political violence and aims to promote a healthy dialogue about the preservation of free speech," Phillips said.
Who is in the video?
The lawmakers depicted being shot, stabbed and set on fire in the video include a plethora of Trump critics from both sides of the aisle. Republicans Sen. Mitt Romney and the late Sen. John McCain are among them.
Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. , Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif. , and 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and former President Barack Obama are some of the many progressives attacked in the video.
Celebrity comedian Kathy Griffin, who was in the video, condemned it as more than just a joke.
"I'm depicted as being murdered by The President of the United States in this video," Griffin tweeted late Sunday. "The left, right & center left me hanging out to dry regarding the Trump mask photo. Please don’t let it happen again. No, this video isn’t a joke to his followers. And it will not be taken as such. "
McCain's family members said the video "violate[s] every norm our society expects from its leaders. " (The video was created before McCain's death but after his cancer diagnosis was public).
Trump was not involved in its creation, but has been silent on Twitter
The Trump administration and campaign were not involved in the video's creation or distribution, according to spokespeople.
Trump is known to attack members of the press, referring to them repeatedly as the "Fake News. "
Since the White House acknowledged on Monday morning that Trump is aware of the video's contents—despite not seeing it first hand—Trump has tweeted several times. He has shared Fox News clips, endorsed Sean Spicer on "Dancing With the Stars" and lambasted Hunter Biden. He has even repeated his "Fake News" refrain.
Wow! Hunter Biden is being forced to leave a Chinese Company. Now watch the Fake News wrap their greasy and very protective arms around him. Only softball questions of him please!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 14, 2019
The White House said that based on his knowledge of the video this morning, he strongly condemned it. But Trump has not personally remarked on the video.
The White House Correspondents' Association and CNN called on Trump to denounce the video.
"We have previously told the President his rhetoric would incite violence. Now we call on him and everybody associated with this conference to denounce this video and affirm that violence has no place in our society," Jonathan Karl, the president of WHCA, said in a statement.

Inside View: What's a Wealth Tax Worth?

Texto completo: Why do liberals think rich people have money just lying around, like Scrooge McDuck swimming in a giant pool of gold coins? That's the myth behind plans to tax Americans' wealth, as Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders both propose.
Ms. Warren wants an annual asset tax of 2% on households worth more than $50 million, and 3% if you're worth more than $1 billion. Mr. Sanders would tax "extreme wealth" starting at 1% on households worth $32 million and topping out at 8% on those worth $10 billion or more. Whereas the Soviets confiscated wealth virtually overnight, at least Bernie will take a dozen or so years to pilfer most of your savings.
University of California, Berkeley professors Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman estimate that Mr. Sanders's tax would raise $4.35 trillion over 10 years, while Ms. Warren's would raise $2.75 trillion. But something seems fishy -- oh, Messrs. Saez and Zucman advise both campaigns on their wealth-tax plans. I doubt they account properly for how levies on wealth would shrink the tax base. Can we get some outside audits please?
Even setting comical revenue projections aside, the wealth-tax idea doesn't stand up to scrutiny. Never mind that it's likely unconstitutional. Or that a wealth tax is triple taxation, heaped on top of a 21% corporate tax plus 20% capital-gains tax when someone sells shares to pay it. (I concede that it definitely would provide lifetime employment for tax lawyers.)
The most preposterous part of the wealth-tax plans is their supporters' insistence that they would be good for the economy. Only in an upside-down world could anyone think "a wealth tax is pro-growth," as a New York Times columnist has claimed.
Start with the spending side. If the Democrats gain the presidency and Senate, the wealth tax would help fund a phantasmagoria of new mandates, like the Medicare free-for-all and the blingy Green New Deal. The candidates will say most of the revenue would go toward education and infrastructure -- both areas in which unions have overwhelming control over employment. C'mon, Liz and Bernie, we're not that dumb.
The revenue side is even worse, as a wealth tax would suck money away from productive investments. Of course liberals in favor of taxation always trot out the tired trope that the poor drive growth by spending their money while the rich hoard it, tossing gold coins in the air in their basement vaults. As the Times put it, wealthy Americans supposedly have "more money than they know what to do with." So just tax the rich and government spending will create great jobs for the poor and middle class.
This couldn't be more wrong. As anyone with $1 billion -- or $1,000 -- knows, people don't stuff their mattresses with Benjamins. They invest them. Sure, you might have some in a checking account that doesn't pay interest; you don't even get a toaster anymore! But if money's in an account, it's being invested.
Maybe it's in a bank making local mortgage loans. Maybe in a money-market account that provides short-term funding to companies and municipalities. Maybe even in corporate or government debt. But most likely it's in stocks or invested directly in job-creating companies that are doing new things and destroying the old.
A wealth tax takes money out of the hands of some of the most productive members of society and directs it toward the least productive uses. Sure, roads and bridges used to be productive -- more than half a century ago, when Eisenhower's interstate highway system was built. Education was also a fruitful investment back then, helping build an industrial workforce. But these causes are already funded by existing taxes on gasoline and property. Rather than drawing new revenue, the gaps in funding for infrastructure and education should be narrowed by cutting waste -- like ever-growing teacher pensions and layers of administration.
Today the productivity is further up the value chain. To knock down the roadblocks to a more efficient economy, America needs investments in its 5G and fiber-optic networks and enterprise software and artificial intelligence. But wait, there are already people willing to invest in these areas, independent of the government -- the same people the wealth taxes target.
So really, with no rational economic use, a wealth tax is big-government punitive class warfare. It's obvious. Ms. Warren rails against Wall Street "looting" and considers private-equity firms "vampires." Mr. Sanders's website keeps a list of his "anti-endorsements," from Jamie Dimon to Andy Puzder -- a practical Who's Who of successful job creators.
So what's the right way to tax wealthy people? Robert Hall and Alvin Rabushka proposed a flat tax on income from employment, with no deductions save for a personal allowance. In fact they did it on these pages in 1981. The government would replace all taxes on corporate and personal income with a simple levy on total compensation. The op-ed even showed a postcard-size mock tax form.
The point is that existing taxes on interest, dividends and capital gains discourage the healthy savings that create jobs in the economy. These are effectively taxes on wealth -- and we don't need another one.

ELECTION 2020; ... 10, 11, 12 (!) hopefuls will spar in Democratic debate; Tom Steyer is the new face in the pack for largest primary debate ever

Texto completo: Have you ever wanted to see 12 politicians on a debate stage, at the same time, on the same night, fighting for the same job, clobbering each other to claim tiny morsels of preciously limited speaking time? No? Well, too bad.
On Tuesday night, the top dozen Democratic candidates are set to appear at the party's fourth 2020 primary debate, set at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio, starting at 5 p.m. Pacific. The debate, co-hosted by CNN and the New York Times, will be broadcast on CNN and streamed online at www.cnn.com and www.nytimes.com, as well as on the outlets' apps.
The candidates are former Vice President Joe Biden; Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren; Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders; California Sen. Kamala Harris; Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. ...

Still going, stay with us ...
New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker; former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas; former Housing Secretary Julian Castro; Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii; Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar ... and (deep breath) businessmen Andrew Yang and Tom Steyer.
The number of candidates onstage appears to be the largest ever in a primary debate, which is likely to irritate and bewilder many undecided Democratic voters who have been hoping the massive field might narrow to a more manageable number. Especially because last month's debate featured only -- "only" -- 10 candidates.
--
Wait, this debate is bigger? Why?
The Democratic National Committee didn't limit the number of candidates who could qualify for the party's sanctioned television debates -- they just set the polling and donor requirements that a candidate would need to meet. And this time, more candidates qualified than did last month. The DNC also wanted to keep things to one night rather than two, which is how they all ended up on the same stage.
--
What were the thresholds last time, and what are they now?
They're basically the same. For the September debate, the candidates needed to receive donations from at least 130,000 unique donors, including at least 400 in each of 20 states. They also needed to get at least 2% support in four high-quality polls of voters either across the nation or in the four early-primary states of Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada.
The only thing that changed this time around is that instead of needing to qualify in four polls between June 28 and Aug. 28, the qualification window widened to polls taken between June 28 and Oct. 1.
--
In other words, the bar isn't any higher, but the candidates got more chances to jump over it.
Exactly. It's like if you got to take a driver's test over and over again until you finally figure out how to parallel park.
--
Who's new?
Gabbard and Steyer. The other 10 candidates are the same from September.
--
What do I need to know about Gabbard?
Gabbard qualified to return to the debate stage after missing the last round, but last week she threatened to boycott, calling the debates "commercialized reality television meant to entertain, rather than to inform or enlighten."
In the second round in August, Gabbard made a bit of a splash with sharp attacks on Harris' record as a prosecutor and attorney general in California, telling the senator "the people who suffered under your reign as prosecutor -- you owe them an apology."
It got some viewers' attention, but that didn't immediately translate into the gains Gabbard needed to proceed to the third round.
--
What do I need to know about Steyer?
Steyer is the truly new face on the Democratic stage. The billionaire liberal activist had been leading a movement to impeach President Trump before declaring he was entering the race in July, long after the other candidates on the stage had gotten their starts.
Steyer also has the lowest name recognition of the major Democratic candidates, according to Morning Consult data -- even lower than several who did not qualify for the stage.
But it turns out it's useful to be a billionaire with a record of activism. Steyer pledged to spend $100 million of his own money on his campaign, and he began by shelling out cash to acquire voter and activist data collected by the advocacy groups he started. The strategy seems to be, pardon the pun, paying off.
--
Who's missing?
Self-help author (and occasional mystically leavening stage presence) Marianne Williamson didn't make the cut, but she's still campaigning. So are Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado, Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio, former Rep. John Delaney of Maryland, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock and former Rep. Joe Sestak of Pennsylvania, who appears to be campaigning just in New Hampshire this month.
--
Who's moderating?
CNN anchors Erin Burnett and Anderson Cooper and New York Times national editor Marc Lacey.
--
How are they going to handle this many candidates at one time?
Some wooden fencing, maybe? Those eye blinders that racehorses wear so they don't get distracted? We'll find out!
--
When's the next debate after this one?
Nov. 20 in Georgia, co-hosted by the Washington Post and MSNBC. The next round will feature slightly higher qualification rules for polling and donations, though Biden, Warren, Sanders, Harris, Buttigieg, Yang, Booker and Steyer -- yes, Steyer -- have already qualified.
--
The New York Times is co-hosting one, the Washington Post ... so newspapers are having a moment, huh?
We couldn't possibly comment.

Texto completo: Republicans have come to accept what they once professed to abhor.
The terrains of acceptability and respectability have shifted under the American conservative.
That which was once forbidden is now embraced. That which they once condemned they cheer. Conservatism has been unveiled in all its craven glory. No longer is it shrouded behind morality, small government, traditional values and spending concerns.
President Trump is the new doctrine, and Republicans bought it. There is no amount of cruelty or crudeness he can display that Republicans won't cheer and defend. His corruption has become theirs.
And, it is possible that Trump is growing bolder in his coarseness, and it is revealed that there is precious little that will shake loose his base and its blind devotion to him.
Last week, Trump went on more profanity-laced tirades. At a campaign rally in Minnesota, Trump said of Joe Biden: "He was only a good vice president because he understood how to kiss Barack Obama's ass."
Let's ignore for the moment that one could not find a more obsequious vice president than Mike Pence, a man who looks at Trump like he's made of rainbows and cotton candy.
Let's instead focus on the coding of the charge against Biden, whether Trump is conscious of it or not, whether it was intentional or not.
The insult invokes a fear and disdain that white racists have had throughout American history: The subjugation of the white man to the black one.
Indeed, Jim Crow was born out of a fear of "Negro domination" in which white Southerners were deadly afraid that they could be forced to live under black rule in the wake of the Civil War.
This was a real possibility. In the 1870 census, the first after the enslaved were emancipated, several Southern states were majority black and several others were within striking distance of that marker.
And many Southerners despised Northern liberals for seeming to encourage the ascendance of black people in the South.
So, Southern states, beginning with Mississippi, called constitutional conventions to write white supremacy into the DNA of those states.
The subjugation of Biden, the Northern white liberal, to the black man is not only a symbol but an omen. The white supremacists see this as a particular kind of racial betrayal and racial subjugation that can never be made normal.
To them, these white men and women who would happily play second fiddle to a black man -- or white feminist, or someone who is Hispanic or Arab, or someone who is LGBTQ -- is engaged in surrender of the white racist patriarchy. It is a sign of weakened, misplaced affections, and a lust of annihilation. These white liberals to them are N-word lovers.
That is why Obama stays on the tip of Trump's tongue. The invocation of him is a hot-wire shorthand that gives an emotional charge to his statements that his audience receives intuitively. The racism is coded, received, without the burden of delivery.
The disdain for and distrust of Obama is still strong and abiding.
Conservatives scoured every facet of his life looking for a scandal and found none. They picked at every imaginary faux pas -- wearing a tan suit, putting his feet on the desk, putting mustard on his burger -- and yet they not only defend Trump's truly vulgar behaviors, they cheer them.
Sarah Palin made a whole campaign out of saying that Obama "pals around with terrorists," while Trump quite literally cozies up to murderous dictators and brags about the love letters he exchanges with one.
Republicans see nothing wrong here. Trump is a rich white man defending white supremacy and white nationalism. For him, the rules are different. For him, certain dispensations must be given.
According to Politico:
"One of Donald Trump's most prominent Christian supporters will argue in a book due out before the 2020 general election that American evangelicals 'have a moral obligation to enthusiastically back' the president."
How can that be?
Pat Robertson, upset last week over Trump's unconscionable abandoning of the Kurds in northern Syria, said: "The president of the United States is in danger of losing the mandate of heaven if he permits this to happen."
As if he had a mandate from heaven.
The way that the Religious Right has bent and distorted biblical doctrine to support this vulgar man is absolutely obscene. It makes a mockery of their faith and their supposed philosophies.
The moment that Trump insisted on separating immigrant children from their families, locking those children in cages and arguing in court against having to provide soap and toothbrushes to those children, or against turning off the lights so that they could sleep, should have been the red line to any true Christian -- or for any human being with a shred of compassion, regardless of faith. But it wasn't. So, now I no longer know what to call these people.
Righteousness simply can't be this transactional and situational. What is the point of your books of rules if you will gladly oblige a man who flouts them? Either morality has meaning or it doesn't.

Resumen: It sounds creepy, but 'Shark Tank' stars bit on Eterneva, which turns human or pet ashes into wearable diamonds

Texto completo: They say that diamonds are forever, but on Sunday’s “Shark Tank,” two entrepreneurs certainly felt the pressure.
As seen recently in The New York Times, Eterneva specializes in immortalizing deceased loved ones (including pets) and letting you carry them everywhere you go. Using either a cup of their ashes or hair, along with high-pressured heat, the Austin, Texas, company turns your loved one into a forever diamond in 10 months.
Eterneva is the brainchild of Adelle Archer and Garrett Ozar, who pitched the sharks on Sunday's show, asking for $600,000 for a 5% stake, which values the business at $12 million.
“This is about a remarkable person; someone full of hope and joy,” Archer said as footage of a woman killed in a car wreck, and mourned by her mother, played on a screen. “We’re eternalizing remarkable people, and this is how you will take them with you on the rest of life’s adventures. ”
The new bestsellers: 'Shark Tank' exclusive: The new list of the 20 best-selling products from the show
The concept, which generated $913,000 in sales in their first year, initially wowed and shocked the sharks, and left Kevin O’Leary asking the real question: “It has to be cremation, obviously, or can you take a piece of somebody out of a coffin?” (The other sharks winced. )
What didn’t wow them was the discovery that Eterneva had already raised $1. 2 million through a round of investors at a $10 million valuation.
Shaking his head, Mark Cuban said: “You come on here knowing you’re going to have to negotiate, and that puts a cap on what you’re able to negotiate. ”
Fellow shark Daymond John was concerned whether Eterneva really needed a shark’s investment: “Tens of thousands of people apply to stand on this rug, and every person that takes this carpet that has the money, then they took a chance away from someone who desperately needed help. ”
Archer and Ozar stood in silence, unsure how to respond. Cuban clarified: “What he’s asking you is, are you happy with the commercial we are making for you right now?”
Archer disagreed, insisting they coveted a shark’s investment: “Seriously guys, our investors are wonderful. (But) they’re tech investors. They aren’t the people who can help. This is a household brand and experience, and we need partners who can help us get in front of consumers. ”
When it came to negotiating, Cuban and Robert Herjavec wanted to see how serious Archer and Ozar were about an investment. “I hate the fact that you have the other investors, yet you’re here," Herjavec told them. "If you value us, you have to pay a premium for that. ”
Yet the two entrepreneurs fielded three offers: Cuban's, for $600,000 for a 15% stake; Herjavec, who wanted 10%; and O’Leary, asking for 12%. But they refused to budge from a $10 million valuation. Cuban turned down their initial counteroffer of $600,000 for 6% and said: “You’re proving my point about why you’re here. ”
Ozar tried to negotiate a combined deal between Cuban and Herjavec for $1 million for a 10% stake, but the two sharks refused, even after he offered an additional 2% in advisory shares.
Both Herjavec and O’Leary retracted their deals. O’Leary decided he could start his own ashes-to-diamonds business. “Frankly, I could do this myself," he'd said earlier. "I could buy four machines and bang out cat diamonds. ”
With only Cuban left to negotiate, Archer and Ozar’s final offer was $600,000 for 7. 5%, an $8 million valuation.
“If you give me the $600,000 for 9%, I’ll do it,” Cuban said. “That might mean each of you giving up one point. One percent from each of you, the 1% advisory shares, the 6% for the $600,000, that gets you there. ”
Archer and Ozar agreed to the deal and walked out of the tank relieved.

Texto completo: The Associated Press
NEW YORK - Gunfire broke out inside an illegal gambling club in Brooklyn early Saturday, police said, leaving four people dead, three wounded, and investigators trying to piece together what prompted the bloodshed.
The shooting inside the small, nondescript club started just before 7a.m. as around 15 people were gambling with dice and cards, police said.
At a news conference hours later, Chief of Detectives Dermot Shea said investigators were trying to determine if a gambling dispute, a robbery, or something else was to blame for the violence.
"A bit of a chaotic scene," Shea said.
Two handguns were recovered. Multiple shots were fired and police didn't immediately say how many people might have been shooting.
The victims, who have not been identified, ranged in age from 32 to 49, Shea said. Two may have lived out of state and the rest were from neighborhoods throughout Brooklyn.
All of the people shot were men, save for one wounded woman. The injured were expected to survive. One additional person was hurt fleeing.
No one was immediately charged in the shooting, but police were questioning survivors and reviewing security camera footage.
"We have some individuals back at the 77th Precinct and we're trying to piece together exactly what transpired in that location," Shea said.
The unlicensed club, adorned with a sign identifying it as the "Triple A Aces Private & Social Event Space," was operating on the first floor of an older wood-frame townhouse on a block with some empty storefronts and boarded-up buildings.
Isaac Mickens, a community organizer, described the place as a "hole-in-the-wall gambling den" in an interview with The New York Times. "It was real tight, real small, casual, low-key," Mickens said. "A little hangout spot."
Mickens said that when he headed toward the club after the shooting he saw people running and screaming, "Oh God! Oh God!"
The local police precinct headquarters is two blocks away. Officers had not previously received any complaints about the location, Chief of Patrol Rodney Harrison said.
Shea said there was no immediate sign that the shootings had any connection to gangs, which have been a problem in that part of Brooklyn.
Crime scene tape surrounded the building Saturday morning and investigators in white jumpsuits could be seen going in and out.
The shooting was the second mass killing in New York in a week. Four homeless men were beaten to death , allegedly by another homeless man, on Oct. 5 in Manhattan's Chinatown.
Until those killings, the city had been on pace to challenge its post-World War II record for the fewest homicides. Last year it had fewer than 300 in a city of more than 8.5 million people.
Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, said on Twitter that the city "awoke to senseless gun violence."
"I've said it before and I'll say it until I can't anymore: we have an epidemic of gun violence that spares no community - and it won't stop until we get guns off our streets once and for all," he said.

Second City missed its shot at improv rap

Texto completo: Buoyed by the star power of Lin-Manuel Miranda, Broadway has suddenly discovered improvisational rap.
Reviews for the new, 90-minute comedy show "Freestyle Love Supreme" mostly have been ecstatic and filled with language such as "fresh," "exciting," "new" and "revolutionary." According to Ben Brantley in the New York Times, this is a show to "pump you full of hope."
"Freestyle Love Supreme" is, for sure, a lot of fun and performed by an accomplished crew. But for a critic from Chicago, the success of this show, which charges $199 for an orchestra seat, raises a lot of complicated questions, beginning with this one: How did Second City miss out on the freestyle phenomenon and Broadway's sudden embrace of improv?
After all, much of the content of this show uses devices that have been popular in Chicago for at least 30 years, if not more.
Take for example one of the major scenes in "Freestyle Love Supreme," which involves questioning audience members to get the details of what they did in the 24 hours prior to coming to the theater. That material then forms the basis for the improv, which made up about 25 percent of the show on the night I was there. If you are a regular at Second City, or a former student there, you likely will know this as "A Day in the Life," a Wells Street staple for decades, and typically performed to music accompaniment.
Another 25 percent of "Freestyle Love Supreme" comes from an audience suggestion of a childhood memory -- "biting my sister" on the night I was there. If you have been a regular at iO in Chicago this last decade or two, you likely will know that as a version of an improv game called "The Armando," as widely associated with the great Armando Diaz and, of course, Del Close.
Even the show's organizational structure -- a regular crew enhanced by celebrities who make irregular, unannounced and box office-boosting appearances -- is straight from the Second City playbook. Many has been the ticket buyer at Second City in Chicago who has hoped that a visiting bold-faced name might appear in the post-show improv set -- the pickings were especially rich back when the Oprah Winfrey show was still in town.
Heck, there are even "Freestyle Love Supreme" classes available, hawked from the stage. And teaching the work has always been a part of the Second City and iO business plans, thus explaining the hundreds, if not thousands, of young improvisers who move to Chicago every year to hone their craft. Both institutions make plenty from the spending of students at their bars.
Of course, "Freestyle Love Supreme" has a crucial difference from the kinds of improv you can see at these citadels of creative amusement in Chicago: The performers are rappers who improvise to an accompanying musical beat and, in this particular field, a mark of accomplishment is the ability to create spontaneous rhymes. Those are the laugh lines and applause magnets.
There is a long history of freestyle, of course, including such performers as Myka 9, Kool Moe Dee and Eminem, famous for his creepy ability to forge seemingly impossible rhymes spontaneously.
But Miranda has been especially good at performing and marketing this skill, freestyling everywhere from the Lyric Opera (with this writer as a pathetic beatboxer) to pretty much every late-night chat show in the land. It goes without saying that this is a difficult craft to learn and practice -- most of the great improvisers, such as Chicago's legendary TJ Jagodowski and Dave Pasquesi, don't typically improvise in rhyme. Even the Chicago rappers GQ and JAQ (famous for "The Bomb-itty of Errors" and other attractions) usually work with scripted rhymes, not ones that need to pop into your head within a split second.
So why is it not Chicago bringing improv to a newly receptive Broadway?
The answers are myriad. An obvious one is that the improv field, initially dominated by white guys from the University of Chicago, was slow to diversify and that rap is associated with performers of color. To some, white rappers still are a form of pernicious cultural appropriation, although not every performer in "Freestyle Love Supreme" is a performer of color. So that's one major reason. (As was reported in Rolling Stone, the company member Andrew Bancroft (Jelly Donut) has acknowledged through freestyle his debt to rappers of color.)
You could also argue that Second City's lack of development of freestyle rap is geographic; the musical base for the form was invented in the outer boroughs of New York City and thus has a situational logic there. On the other hand, the title of "Freestyle Love Supreme" references John Coltrane, and jazz is a historical referent for all this too. Chicago's bonafides there are unimpeachable.
Then there is the long-term reticence of Second City to tackle New York City: Baked into its name and aesthetic is a kind of reverse snobbery, a sense that it does its best work precisely because of its geographic remove from a coastal cultural center. Its forays into New York and Los Angeles (there have been attempts off-Broadway) have never been as successful as spin-off companies working in other cities with chips on their shoulders, such as Toronto and Detroit. Improv in Chicago never has been about Broadway grosses, but, especially within the purist Del Close universe, the purity of the art form.
It's overstating the issue to say that Second City and iO revues never have contained freestyle rap -- the performer Edgar Blackmon was revered for his spontaneous rhymes, and there have been others. "Improvised Shakespeare" at iO works almost entirely in improvised rhyme. You might remember a few moments within those mostly scripted Mainstage and e.t.c. revues, and people have freestyled at iO and elsewhere.
But Second City is a theater that has used and presented improv mostly within a scripted format, although, for the record, "Freestyle Love Supreme" is far more structured than many people realize. Still, put all that together and you'll see why improv rap has not been at the core of the Second City, or any of the other Chicago comedy institutions.
That merits rethinking. Broadway has this fall been presenting all kinds of populist entertainment: concerts, a mentalist (Derren Brown) a movie (Martin Scorsese's "The Irishman"), a David Byrne artistic endeavor. None of these are what has been considered traditional Broadway fare.
But that's changed in this era of must-see TV. What do these new ventures have in common? Live audiences are craving more intense levels of interactions for their entertainment dollar. They often prefer not to sit down in the dark and shut up. They want to be a part of the event, which explains not only all the performers with vocal fan bases, but the dizzying increase in shows depending on audience interaction.
In other words, the Broadway pump is primed for improv. And does not Second City have more celebrity alums than any other comedy theater on this planet? Would they not come to play on an irregular basis? Would they not consent to people having at least the possibility of seeing them do the thing that almost all of them say was the greatest fun they ever had in their lives?

Ep 'intrigued' Gates: report; But his perv pal's 'lifestyle would not work' for him

Texto completo: Bill Gates reportedly had a much closer relationship with Jeffrey Epstein than he previously admitted and once called the billionaire pedophile's lifestyle "intriguing."
The world's second-wealthiest man had "numerous" meetings with Epstein, including at least three at his opulent Manhattan townhouse, and considered partnering with the pervy mogul in a charitable fund-raising plan that could have netted Epstein $30 million in fees, The New York Times reported Saturday.
More damning, Gates first struck up his personal and business relationship with Epstein in 2011, when he was already a convicted pedophile.
After meeting Epstein for the first time in a late-night gabfest at the mansion, Gates (left inset) wrote a cringeworthy email to colleagues.
"His lifestyle is very different and kind of intriguing although it would not work for me," Gates wrote, according to the Times.
The two men were reportedly joined by a Swedish ex-beauty queen and her 15-year-old daughter.
"A very attractive Swedish woman and her daughter dropped by and I ended up staying there quite late," Gates reportedly wrote in the message.
A spokeswoman for Gates said he "regrets ever meeting" Epstein (right inset), particularly since Gates' eponymous foundation has championed the cause of young women's well-being.
The spokeswoman insisted that Gates was referring "solely to the unique decor" when he mentioned Epstein's "intriguing" lifestyle - not the pedophile's confessed predilection for sex with young women and girls.
The same mansion where Gates met Epstein played a central role in the accusations against the fiendish financier, who hanged himself in jail over the summer while awaiting trial in a sprawling pedophilia scandal.
Epstein was accused of paying dozens of young women and girls for sex at the mansion. Some of the alleged victims say they were raped or trafficked to have sex with him.
Even the "decor" that Gates' spokeswoman mentions might have been a clue that Epstein was a less-than-savory partner for a reputable philanthropist like Gates: Witnesses have mentioned that Epstein's taste in art included giant photos and paintings of naked young girls.
Two senior employees of Gates' foundation reportedly had even more extensive ties to Epstein.
Melanie Walker, a former aspiring Victoria's Secret underwear model, worked in different capacities for Epstein for about 15 years and lived in a building that he owned, starting soon after graduating from college, the Times reported.
She supposedly served as the pedophile's so-called "science adviser" for several years.
After joining the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in 2006, she met with Epstein many times at his mansion.
Boris Nikolic, another top foundation executive, was a close friend of Epstein and was named as an executor in his will, a role he refused to accept after Epstein's suicide.

Texto completo: President Trump defended his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani on Saturday amid reports that federal prosecutors are investigating whether the former New York City mayor broke lobbying laws in his efforts to oust the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yavonovitch.
"So now they are after the legendary 'crime buster' and greatest Mayor in the history of NYC, Rudy Giuliani," he tweeted.
Trump revived a conspiracy theory that a "deep state" of bureaucrats and law enforcement officers are continuing to undermine him and his allies. "Such a one sided Witch Hunt going on in USA. Deep State. Shameful!" he said.
The president's tweet follows a report in The New York Times that federal prosecutors in Manhattan are investigating Giuliani's efforts to have Yavonovitch recalled in a broader effort to pressure Ukraine into investigating former vice president Joe Biden's son, who sat on the board of a Ukrainian energy company.
Two of Giuliani's associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, were arrested Wednesday on charges of campaign finance violations. According to an indictment unsealed Thursday, the men were working for Ukrainian officials to remove Yovanovitch from her job.
Giuliani has admitted to trying to oust Yovanovitch but denies violating foreign lobbying disclosure laws because he was acting on behalf of the president.

A Healthy Fear of China

Texto completo: As the N.B.A. defers to Beijing, a little more Western paranoia might be advantageous. "I have seen the future, and it works," the left-wing journalist Lincoln Steffens famously declared, after observing Bolshevik Russia in its infancy. What was intended as a utopian boast soon read as a dystopian prediction -- but then eventually, as Stalinist ambition gave way to Brezhnevian decay, it curdled into a sour sort of joke. By the time the Soviet Union dissolved, even the people inclined to defend the "ideals" of Marxism tended to acknowledge that as a system for managing an advanced economy and running an effective government, the one thing Soviet Communism definitely didn't do was work.
Today, though, there is a palpable fear in the liberal West that Beijing is succeeding where Moscow failed, and that the peculiar blend of Maoist dogmatics, nationalist fervor, one-party meritocracy and surveillance-state capitalism practiced in the People's Republic of China really is a working alternative to liberal democracy -- with cruelty sustained by efficiency, and a resilience that might outstrip our own.
This fear is stoked by a growing realization that the "Chimerica" project, our great integration of markets and supply chains, has had roughly the opposite effect to the one its American architects anticipated. Instead of importing liberal ideas into China and undermining the Politburo's rule, the Chimerican age has strengthened Beijing's policy of social control and imported totalitarian influences into the officially free world.
[ Listen to "The Argument" podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt. ]
A crucial mechanism for both trends is the internet, once hailed as a great liberator and now revealed as something rather different -- a surveillance engine that the N.K.V.D. could only dream about, a machine that induces its users to trade privacy for entertainment and distraction, and a panopticon whose global expanse exposes anyone who wants to do business in China to the manufactured consensus of Chinese nationalism, the grievance politics of the Politburo.
China's influence within American industry is evident well beyond the online realm, of course. But its successful censorship of U.S. businesses generally involves websites, app stores, social media. It's not a coincidence that the National Basketball Association's supine behavior toward China in the past week -- from what is supposedly the most progressive and politically engagé of the American professional sports leagues -- followed from a general manager fleetingly expressing support for the Hong Kong protesters on Twitter. Likewise when China induced Marriott to fire a luckless $ 14-an-hour worker recently, it was for seeming to endorse Tibetan independence by "favoriting" a tweet. Having figured out how to tame their internet, the Chinese are intent on using commercial power to tame ours.
How afraid should this make us? One possibility is that just as Chimerican optimism was once delusional, so now Chimerican fears are overblown. The Chinese regime has capabilities that outstrip Soviet Russia, but deep weaknesses as well. China's demographic picture is potentially disastrous, its economic surge may be leveling off, many of its best and brightest are eager to depart, and it has more to lose than America from constant trade brinksmanship, a trans-Pacific Cold War footing. As with fears of Japanese dominance in the 1990s, some Sinophobes may overrate the internal strength of the Chinese model, the permanence of its ascent.
But one can believe that China may be somewhat weaker than it looks and also believe that the fear of the People's Republic is a healthy thing for Americans to cultivate. For one thing, our policy approach to Chinese power clearly needs adjustment, and yet there are many high-dollar reasons for our elite to protect their Chimerican entanglements -- with "elite" here including not only the influence-peddlers of D.C. and Silicon Valley, but also figures like Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr, whose professional obligations induced him to draw shameful analogies between America's sins and Chinese totalitarianism this week.
Given those elite incentives, the only way our China policy will be permanently adjusted is if the outrage that bubbled against the N.B.A. in recent days becomes a permanent factor in American politics, a sentiment that cannot be ignored.
Then, too, a palpable fear of China as a different, darker model for high-tech modernity could be a useful brake our own potential slide in their direction. Not that we are ever likely to reach the fullness of Xi Jinping Thought and Uighur re-education. But there are clear tendencies within our own society -- the evaporation of privacy and the rise of online mobs, the power of "inner party" oligarchies and the consolidation of tech giants, certain radical ambitions among progressives and certain authoritarian flirtations on the right -- that converge with the Chinese model of oligarchy, surveillance and ideological control.
Given these tendencies and drifts, the bipartisan, pan-ideological outrage over the N.B.A.'s spinelessness is genuinely encouraging. There is a cliché that in fighting an enemy you become much more like them, but the reverse is just as often true. For a divided, balkanized America, it might take the looming-up of a rival power, the rise of a dark but all-too-plausible alternative, to remind us of who we are, and what we do not want to be.

A Few Suggestions For the Hotels

Texto completo: Easy additions that can make hotel stays more pleasant.
These are not tips for travelers. They are tips for hotels and inns on how to make a guest (me, to be specific) happy. My wife, Jane, and I travel a lot and stay in a variety of accommodations, from a sleep-on-the-floor desert oasis in Iran to landmark hotels in Europe to jungle eco-lodges in Nicaragua. Wherever we are, though, it's easy to see things that could be changed to make our stay more pleasant.
The room itself
We recently stayed at the five-star Esplanade in Zagreb, Croatia. Although we had booked almost six months in advance and were staying for four nights, we were given a room with a view into an air shaft. A hotel might call this "a courtyard view," but air ducts and other visible infrastructure made this just a large air shaft. We complained to the desk and were told that rooms are not assigned until the night before a guest's arrival. We ended up staying one night in the original room, and the next day we were moved to a room in the same price category and just as spacious, with park and city views. If we had been walk-ins with no reservation, we might have been happy to get the original room, but it was poor customer care for the hotel to place guests there who had a longstanding reservation. We now know to ask if we're getting the best possible room in our price category.
Luggage racks
My wife and I each travel with a carry-on-size wheeled suitcase and usually another under-the-seat-size bag. Hotel rooms that are clearly set up for couples (two bathrobes, for example) almost never have a second rack for a suitcase. So the room's chair (and it is likely there's only one chair) gets used for a suitcase, or maybe the cabinet that the TV or the coffee maker sits on.
Safes
The safe should be large enough to hold a small laptop or at least a tablet, and it should be mounted high enough that the guest doesn't have to sit on the floor to use it.
T V
Please provide a list of the channels, and set the TV so that it returns to the same channel after being turned off and on again. I hate it when every time the TV is turned off, it returns to a default setting, so that it again welcomes you to the hotel and makes you click through a menu to get to television channels, and then you have to click through maybe 30 channels to find the one you were watching earlier.
In the Bathroom
Single-use plastics
Many hotels and cruise lines are getting rid of these little bottles of bath gel, shampoo and conditioner. I'd rather have those three products in wall-mounted dispensers in the shower.
Counter space
There should be room for at least two toiletry bags on the counter or a shelf in the bathroom. Even the most rustic inns usually have room for a wooden shelf above the toilet or elsewhere in the bathroom. And there should be a rack or shelf in the shower for the guest's razor or the guest's own soap and hair products in the shower.
Laundry
Traveling with small suitcases for weeks at a time means there is going to be laundry to do. We often handwash items at night and hope they will dry overnight, hanging on doorknobs or shower heads. Remember the clothes lines that some motels had in their bathrooms? Guests could pull a line out of a stainless-steel disc on one wall and attach it to a receptacle on another. Why aren't they universally available? Even quick-drying clothes marketed to travelers need a place to hang.
Hooks
It's a small thing, but a few wall hooks can be important, especially in the bathroom. Many hotels encourage guests to use their bath towels a second or third time, but give them no place to hang the towel to dry other than maybe a shower curtain rod. And, like the towels, the bathrobes are likely to be folded and on a shelf at check-in. Where do we put them when we take them off? We need hooks, which are also good for baseball caps, shopping bags and other things. Such a small thing can make a difference.

Questionable Comments On Impeachment Inquiry

Texto completo: Defenders of President Trump have employed a number of arguments to back up their assertion that the impeachment inquiry begun by House Democrats last month amounts to a "kangaroo court." They have cited historical precedent, the Constitution and public polling among other arguments against the inquiry. Here's a fact check of some of their most-invoked claims.
What Was Said
"In the 240-plus years of our history, those rare times where we have had impeachment process, it's always gone through the House Judiciary Committee, because the House Judiciary Committee is the committee of jurisdiction over the Constitution and over impeachment. It's not the Intelligence Committee."
-- Representative John Ratcliffe, Republican of Texas, in an interview this month
False.
In her announcement last month initiating formal impeachment proceedings against Mr. Trump, Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she had directed six committees -- including the Intelligence Committee, whose chairman, Adam B. Schiff of California, has drawn Mr. Trump's ire -- to proceed with investigations under "that umbrella of impeachment inquiry." Behind closed doors, she said the committees should forward their cases on potentially impeachable offenses by Mr. Trump to the Judiciary Committee.
This arrangement, according to Mr. Ratcliffe, amounts to a jurisdictional violation. But while impeachment inquiries have been typically conducted by the House Judiciary Committee since its formation in 1813, there is no rule mandating it and there is precedent for other committees taking the lead.
Special committees began impeachment inquiries against federal judges in 1804, 1808 and 1839. And in 1867, after the Judiciary Committee voted to not send articles of impeachment against President Andrew Johnson to the full House, a second attempt to impeach him succeeded after an inquiry by the Committee on Reconstruction.
"There is certainly no constitutional requirement that any specific committee take it up," said Frank O. Bowman III, a law professor at the University of Missouri and expert on impeachment. "The Johnson case really illustrates the basic principle: The House can run an impeachment any way they darn well please."
What Was Said
"In the history of our nation, the House of Representatives has never attempted to launch an impeachment inquiry against the President without a majority of the House taking political accountability for that decision by voting to authorize such a dramatic constitutional step."
-- Pat A. Cipollone, White House counsel, in a letter on Tuesday to House Democratic leaders
This is misleading.
Though the full chamber voted to start impeachment inquiries against Presidents Bill Clinton and Richard M. Nixon, nothing in the Constitution or House rules requires it. And outside of presidents, there are several cases of judicial impeachments that began without a vote.
"In the past, House committees, under their general investigatory authority, have sometimes sought information and researched charges against officers prior to the adoption of a resolution to authorize an impeachment investigation," according to an October report from the Congressional Research Service.
For example, impeachment inquiries into three federal judges in the 1980s began without explicit authorization by the full House, according to the report.
While the whole House voted to start impeachment investigations into Mr. Clinton and Mr. Nixon, whether such a vote was taken in Mr. Johnson's is more ambiguous. In the second attempt to impeach the 17th president, the full House voted on and approved resolutions authorizing the Committee on Reconstruction to begin a general investigation and to obtain the evidence gathered previously by the Judiciary Committee. But those resolutions did not explicitly authorize a second impeachment inquiry.
"There's no requirement in the Constitution that the House do anything specific, in any order, prior to voting to approve articles of impeachment," said Stephen Vladeck, a constitutional law professor at the University of Texas.
Mr. Bowman, who called the White House letter "a parade of absurdities," noted that impeachment is just one of the powers granted to Congress so "if you took the White House argument seriously, it would mean that there has to be a vote" before any House committee could begin hearings on legislation related to interstate commerce, budgets or even establishing post offices.
What Was Said
"The House of Representatives is now essentially running an impeachment process without following precedent, without allowing the president to have counsel, without allowing the president to call witnesses or have subpoena power."
-- Ronna McDaniel, chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, in an interview this week
"If they have a vote to do a formal impeachment inquiry, historically, precedent is such that, yes, then everyone gets the right, the minority party gets rights. Certainly, the White House gets rights. The president gets rights that aren't there now."
-- Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio, in an interview this week
This is misleading.
This argument -- which featured prominently in Mr. Cipollone's letter and has been echoed by other defenders of Mr. Trump -- misrepresents the separation of duties in Congress in regards to the impeachment process: The House investigates and charges, and the Senate holds trial.
Allowing the subject of an impeachment inquiry to call witnesses or present counterevidence is not required in either the Constitution or House rules. The House Judiciary Committee did hear testimony from the White House counsel at the request of the Clinton administration in 1998 and allowed Mr. Nixon's defense lawyers to present rebutting evidence in 1974. But no such accommodation was made in Mr. Johnson's case, who was impeached by the House before it even drew up articles of impeachment.
"It's perfectly reasonable for folks to suggest that the House should follow these more conciliatory precedents," Mr. Vladeck said. "It's completely false to argue that it's under any constitutional or legal obligation to do so."
After a successful impeachment vote, the House then appoints lawmakers known as managers who essentially act as prosecutors in a Senate trial. The impeachment rules in the upper chamber do offer the impeached person some rights. Witnesses, for example, may be cross-examined and each side -- the House managers and the impeached person -- can make closing arguments before the Senate.
What Was Said
"Remember when Pelosi said that the transcript would show a quid pro quo? It doesn't."
-- Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, in an interview this month
False.
"No quid pro quo" has become a rallying cry among those opposed to an impeachment inquiry, particularly since the reconstituted transcript of the phone call between Mr. Trump and the Ukrainian president was released on Sept. 25. (The phrase appears in talking points the White House pushed to its surrogates).
A spokesman for Mr. Graham cited remarks Ms. Pelosi made to House Democrats in a closed-door meeting on Sept. 24, the day before the transcript was released. But in those remarks, she focused less on the need to prove an exchange of favors, arguing that simply asking for foreign intervention into an election was inappropriate enough.
"Don't get caught in the trap of, oh, there is no quid pro quo. No, he asked for assistance from the foreign government. That's wrong," she said.
"It's really important to know this: There is no requirement that there be a quid-pro-quo in the conversation," Ms. Pelosi said in public remarks that day. "We don't ask foreign governments to help us in our elections, that's what we tried to stop with Russia. It's wrong."
Other Democratic leaders in the House also echoed that sentiment.
"It's not necessary for us to find evidence of a quid pro quo," Mr. Schiff said on Sept. 22. "You don't need an explicit quid pro quo to betray your country."
What Was Said
False.
Mr. Trump appears to be referring to a Washington Post-Schar School poll released on Tuesday. But that poll shows 58 percent of Americans support an impeachment inquiry, and 49 percent support removing Mr. Trump from office. The 25 percent refers to the proportion of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents -- not the electorate at large -- who support an inquiry.
According to the polling average calculated by FiveThirtyEight, 49.3 percent support impeachment, as of Oct. 1, an increase from the 40.1 percent who supported it as of Sept. 19.

Heirs of omission: Who’s in, and not in, a will

Texto completo: These past few weeks we’ve been discussing “omissions” (you can decide whether these are errors or sins). As an estate planning attorney, I instantly think of “omitted heirs.” And you may think, “huh?”
An omitted heir is a person who would have inherited by law but was not mentioned in a will or trust. A related concept is “pretermitted heir”– someone who was born to, adopted by, or married to the deceased after the date of the will. Both situations have legal consequences, which may or may not have been intended.
Occasionally, I meet with a client who intends to disinherit a child. We always state that clearly and upfront in the will with a statement such as “I have intentionally not provided for my child Badly Behaving Bob and for all purposes hereunder he is to be treated as having predeceased me,” and sometimes we add “leaving no issue” if the client also wishes to disinherit any of Bob’s children (and let’s face it, if the behavior was bad enough those grandchildren could be sprinkled across the globe). This can make clients uncomfortable. But there is a reason for it.
California law
California provides that in the case of an omitted or pretermitted heir the heir will inherit an intestate share (what they would have received had there been no will at all) except in some specific circumstances. In other words, the law assumes you mean to provide for your children, with only a few exceptions, which are:
* The decedent’s failure to provide for the child was intentional and that intention appears from the testamentary instruments.
* The decedent had one or more children and devised or otherwise directed the disposition of substantially all the estate to the other parent of the omitted child.
* The decedent provided for the child by transfer outside of the estate, and the intention that the transfer be in lieu of a provision in said instruments is shown by statements of the decedent or by other evidence.
California law also provides that if at the time the decedent executed the estate plan they failed to provide for a child solely because they were unaware of the child or believed the child was deceased, the child will be entitled to take a share of the decedent’s estate.
Thus, documenting your wishes and intentions becomes important in these situations. And disclosing to your attorney any children, stepchildren, adopted children, or possible children you may have is also extremely important.
Celebrity omissions
Remember when actor Heath Ledger died, leaving behind 2-year-old Matilda, his daughter with Michelle Williams? Ledger’s will pre-dated Matilda’s birth by several years and left everything to his sisters and parents.
His will was signed when his assets were estimated at just above $100,000. When he died, his net worth was said to be more than $16 million. Luckily for Matilda, Ledger’s family agreed to give it all to her and no court battle ensued. Ledger was an Australian citizen; in California, the pretermitted heir law would have given the estate to Matilda anyway, but with a greedier family, a long court battle would have likely ensued.
The family of Michael Crichton, creator of Jurassic Park and ER, was not so lucky. At the time of his death in 2008, he was 66 years old and left behind four ex-wives, a 20-year-old daughter, and a new wife who was six months pregnant.
Crichton executed a will and trust in 2007 and specifically stated, “I have intentionally made no provision in this will for any of my heirs or relatives who are not herein mentioned or designated, and I hereby generally and specifically disinherit every person claiming to be or who may be determined to be my heir-at-law, except as otherwise mentioned in this will.”
If Crichton had updated his estate plan when he learned his wife was expecting, a protracted battle between his daughter (who thought that provision should apply to disinherit her half-brother) and the mother of his son (who had a prenup but fought on behalf of her son) could have been avoided. The court eventually ruled that Crichton’s son was entitled to one-third of his estate as a pretermitted heir since his son was not conceived or known of at the time the will was executed.
Crichton’s $100 million art collection soon went to auction at Christie’s to begin making distributions (and paying legal fees, no doubt).
When is a child not a child?
It is equally important to name those who may not be considered “children” by law. It’s not uncommon for a child to take the last name of a stepfather so that mom, stepdad and child all had the same name and to the world at large they were a family. This is particularly true if biological dad is not part of the child’s life.
But if stepdad did not legally adopt the child, the child will not be a legal heir. The stepdad would need to specifically state that he intended to treat the child as his own.
You forgot you were married?
The laws are similar for omitted spouses. When a testamentary document is executed before a marriage and does not mention the spouse, the surviving spouse will be considered a pretermitted heir entitled to all the community property and a share of separate property.
No contest
If you do intend to disinherit a child or a spouse, you will need to carefully state as much in clear language in your will or trust.
In some circumstances, however, you may want to consider a gift to that person instead. I know that sounds nuts, but hear me out. Most folks are aware of the “no-contest” provisions in testamentary documents — that’s the clause that says “if anyone contests this document, they inherit nothing.”
If you’ve completely disinherited someone, they have nothing to lose by contesting your plan. Instead, if you’ve given them a gift at least they have the loss of that gift to consider.
Let me not omit the best advice of all — implement and regularly review your estate plan.

'I care a little': Comey predicts history will vindicate him

Texto completo: Former FBI Director James Comey cares about what people think of him, and it bothers him that he is seen as a villain by many.
"It frustrates me in general that millions of people have a false impression of me," Comey said in a Saturday interview with the New York Times. "I wish they knew I was funnier."
When asked if he cares about his eventual legacy, Comey said, "I was going to say I don’t care. I’m sure I care a little."
He added that he thinks he will be vindicated for his decision to publicly announce the FBI was investigating Hillary Clinton during her 2016 presidential campaign, predicting that "history would judge him kindly for prizing disclosure over concealment." He said, however, he might have been influenced by his belief that Clinton would win the election either way.
Comey, 58, plans to devote his life for the next 13 months to defeating President Trump.
"Like I can’t do something else," he said. "And I couldn’t look myself in the mirror if I went and did something easy."
In July, the Department of Justice declined to prosecute Comey after the inspector general handed a criminal referral over his mishandling of sensitive information.

Texto completo: Hoy abrió al público una plataforma de observación de vidrio en el piso 102 del Empire State Building que ofrece vistas de 360 ​​grados de la ciudad, en un ambiente sin paredes.
La apertura marca el comienzo de lo que los diseñadores llaman la “Experiencia del Observatorio”, resultado de cuatro años y $165 millones de dólares en renovaciones destinadas a resolver las largas colas y la congestión para hacer más atractiva la visita al edificio más famoso de Nueva York y quizá EEUU.
Después de ingresar, ahora a través de la calle 34 en lugar de la 5ta Avenida, los visitantes pasan por la fascinante arquitectura art deco y un modelo de 24 pies del edificio antes de acceder a una exhibición de 10 mil pies cuadrados sobre la historia del edificio abierto en 1931.
La exhibición dinámica y digital impulsa a los visitantes hacia los ascensores que transportan, en 55 segundos, a la cubierta del piso 86.
Los visitantes pueden ir al piso 102 pagando $20 dólares adicionales. Una variedad de beneficios, como tours privados y pases sin colas también están disponibles en paquetes que cuestan hasta $460, describió el New York Times.
“Es, simplemente, una vista inigualable”, dijo el jueves Jean-Yves Ghazi, presidente de Empire State Realty Trust, la compañía propietaria del edificio.
“Somos el punto en el mapa que mantiene unida a esta ciudad”, agregó. “Hay mucho significado aquí. La altura no es el marcador; se trata del estatus icónico de este lugar”.
El mirador en el piso 102 ofrecerá a grupos de unas 55 personas la oportunidad de ver Nueva York desde el panorama más alto de 360 ​​grados en la ciudad , destacó Ghazi.
El observatorio es completamente transparente. Los que se atreven pueden mirar directamente a las calles de abajo.
“Nunca ha habido un mejor momento para darle una nueva mirada” a la ciudad, escribió James S. Russell, recomendando que hasta los neoyorquinos y turistas que han subido al mirador del Empire State deberían volver ahora a redescubrirlo.
* ¿Cuáles son los 10 rascacielos más altos de Nueva York en la actualidad?
* Nueva York tendrá la terraza panorámica más alta del hemisferio, con piso transparente en Hudson Yards

Hopes for a Trade Deal Buoy Indexes

Texto completo: Some days, everything seems to go right.
Stocks rose on Friday, as a burst of optimism on several fronts gave the S&P 500 its first weekly gain after three weeks of decline.
The rally marked a change in mood, after weeks of dour sentiment among investors that had been fueled by a growing list of threats to the health of the economy in the United States and around the world.
Foremost among them had been the toll of the trade battle between China and the United States. In recent weeks, the trade war seemed likely to become something of a frozen conflict, with signs of intransigence on both sides.
But on Friday, President Trump was meeting with Vice Premier Liu He of China at the White House and investors bid up stock prices in anticipation that some kind of an agreement between the two sides would be reached.
The actual announcement that came near the close of trading indicated that an expected tariff increase would not occur next week. But the statement was light on details, and stocks slipped from their highs after it was announced.
The S&P 500 rose 1.1 percent. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 1.3 percent. The Russell 2000 index of small capitalization stocks, typically viewed as closely tied to the health of the American domestic economy, rose 2 percent.
Trade-sensitive parts of the market such as technology and semiconductor shares fared particularly well. The technology sector of the S&P 500 rose 1.5 percent, helping to pull the broader market higher. (The tech sector has the largest weighting in the index, giving it significant influence over the direction of the market.)
But trade wasn't the only reason for Friday's rally. The University of Michigan's closely watched consumer sentiment index rebounded, after a worrying wobble in recent months.
That eased some concern among investors and economists who had seen slumping consumer confidence as an indication that trade-related weakness at American industrial companies was bleeding into the far more important consumer sector.
Consumption accounts for roughly two-thirds of the activity in the American economy, so signs of decline were ominous given pronounced weakness in the mood among business owners, also largely related to uncertainty around trade.
The good news kept coming for stock market investors as the Federal Reserve released its plans to buy some $ 60 billion in Treasury securities each month.
The Fed has taken pains to try to persuade financial markets that the new round of creating money and using it to buy Treasurys is not the same thing as the easy-money-policies the central bank put in place in the wake of the financial crisis. Those programs were intended to push long-term Treasury rates down and support economic growth, and provided a favorable backdrop for stocks for almost the entirety of the more-than-a-decade-long bull market for shares.
This current round of bond buying, the Fed has said, is focused on pumping money into the short-term money markets in order to address technical issues that have resulted in worrying spikes in borrowing costs over the last year.
But many in the markets are less interested in technical distinctions than they are on the prospect of billions' worth of freshly created money pouring into financial markets each month.
"When it swims like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's hard to prove your intentions aren't fowl," wrote Paul Ashworth, chief United States economist with Capital Economics.
Whatever it's called, the flood of Fed cash could come in handy over the coming weeks. Starting in earnest next week, hundreds of major corporations report their third-quarter profits and revenue figures and begin to provide guidance about what to expect in 2020.
Some analysts are viewing that process with some trepidation, and expecting that executives will push investors and analysts to ratchet down their expectations for profit growth next year given a widely expected slowdown in economic growth.
The adjustment could create a rocky period for the market.
But even the news on earnings was good on Friday, as Fastenal, a wholesale distributor of industrial and construction essentials like nuts, bolts and screws, reported better-than-expected revenue and profit numbers. The stock shot higher, notching a gain of more than 16 percent, making it the best-performing company in the S&P 500.
European shares posted some of their best gains of the year, amid optimism that Britain and the European Union may be able to reach an agreement that could allow Britain to make a smooth exit from the bloc this month.
The STOXX Europe 600 rose 2.3 percent.

Texto completo: A breakdown in the nation's regulatory system and poor communication from Boeing compromised the safety of the 737 Max jet before it crashed twice in five months and killed 346 people, according to a damning report released Friday.
Boeing did not adequately explain to federal regulators how a crucial new system on the plane worked, the report says. That system was found to have played a role in the accidents in Indonesia last October and Ethiopia in March.
The Federal Aviation Administration relied heavily on Boeing employees to vouch for the safety of the Max and lacked the ability to effectively analyze much of what Boeing did share about the new plane, according to the report by a multiagency task force. The system of delegation is now being scrutinized by lawmakers in the wake of the tragedies.
Boeing employees who worked on behalf of the F.A.A. faced "undue pressures" at times during the plane's development because of "conflicting priorities," according to the report.
"This report confirms our very worst fears about a broken system," Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, said in an interview. "To put the fox in charge of the henhouse never made any sense, and now we see the deeply tragic consequences."
Hours after the report was released, Boeing's board stripped the company's chief executive, Dennis A. Muilenburg, of his chairman title. The move was the most direct response yet from a board that has resisted shaking up the management team before the Max is flying again, even as pressure mounted inside Boeing to hold someone accountable. The Max has been grounded for more than seven months.
Removing Mr. Muilenburg from his seat as chairman will give the board more independence from management. The board elevated David L. Calhoun, the lead independent director, to serve as chairman. Mr. Calhoun said in a statement that "the board has full confidence in Dennis as C.E.O."
Friday's report, which was put together by representatives of the Federal Aviation Administration, NASA and nine international regulators, provided the first official detailed account of how federal regulators certified the Max. Lawmakers and federal investigators are still conducting their own inquiries into the design and approval of the jet.
The review scrutinized the F.A.A.'s certification of the Max's flight control system, including the new automated system, MCAS, which played a role in both crashes.
The report found that while the F.A.A. had been made aware of MCAS, "the information and discussions about MCAS were so fragmented and were delivered to disconnected groups" that it "was difficult to recognize the impacts and implications of this system."
The task force said it believed that if F.A.A. technical staff had been fully aware of the details of MCAS, the agency would probably have required additional scrutiny of the system that might have identified its flaws.
In each crash, pilots struggled as a single damaged sensor sent the plane into an irrecoverable nose-dive within minutes of takeoff. Regulators around the world grounded the Max after the second accident. Boeing is working on a software fix, and there is no timetable for when regulators will allow the aircraft to return to service.
The task force recommended that the F.A.A. review staffing levels at its Boeing office in Seattle and review the Boeing office that allows company employees to perform certification work.
Boeing is now updating the system to make it less powerful, and it says it will install a modified version when the Max returns to service.
The F.A.A.'s administrator, Steve Dickson, said in a statement that he would "review every recommendation and take appropriate action."
"We welcome this scrutiny and are confident that our openness to these efforts will further bolster aviation safety worldwide," he added.
In a statement, the Boeing spokesman Gordon Johndroe said, "Safety is a core value for everyone at Boeing." The company, he added, "is committed to working with the F.A.A. in reviewing the recommendations and helping to continuously improve the process and approach used to validate and certify airplanes going forward."
The Joint Authorities Technical Review, which produced the report, was led by Chris Hart, a former chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, and included aviation regulators from Europe, China, Brazil and other countries. To conduct the review, Mr. Hart and his team were briefed by F.A.A. officials and Boeing executives, and they scrutinized extensive documentation on the certification of the Max.
A broad theme of the report is that the F.A.A. was too focused on the specifics of the new system and did not put sufficient effort into understanding its overall impact on the plane. In certification documents that Boeing submitted to the F.A.A., MCAS was not evaluated as "a complete and integrated function."
The report also said Boeing had failed to inform the F.A.A. as the design of MCAS changed during the plane's development. A New York Times investigation revealed that the system changed significantly during that process, making MCAS riskier and more powerful, and that key F.A.A. officials in charge of reviewing it were inexperienced or unaware of the overhaul.
The task force said the certification documents that Boeing had provided to the F.A.A. "were not updated during the certification program to reflect the changes" made to MCAS. It added that two critical documents that describe the potential dangers of a system like MCAS, the system safety assessment and the functional hazard assessment, "were not consistently updated."
Boeing also failed to thoroughly stress-test the design of MCAS, according to the report, which found that "the design assumptions were not adequately reviewed, updated or validated."
In addition, the report criticized Boeing for not adequately assessing the extra effort that pilots might have to make to deal with MCAS, and it noted that Boeing had removed mention of MCAS from a draft of the pilot's manual. As a result of that decision, some key F.A.A. officials were not fully aware of MCAS and were "not in a position to adequately assess training needs," the report found.
To address some of these shortcomings, the report recommends that the F.A.A. update the certification process to allow the agency to be more involved early on.
The Max was certified in 2017 as the latest version of the 737 family. Because it was based on a well-known design, the F.A.A. allowed it to undergo a less thorough certification process than if it were an entirely new plane.
"Some elements of the design and certification remain rooted in the original 1967 certification of the B737-100," the review found. But while some modern safety tools have been incorporated into new versions of the 737, others were not included in the Max because they were deemed "impractical," the review found.
Over all, the report found fault with the process for certifying a new plane based on an old design, saying it "lacks an adequate assessment of how proposed design changes integrate with existing systems."
It recommended that the F.A.A. confirm that the Max is in fact compliant with regulations having to do with the plane's flight guidance system, flight manual and stall demonstration.
Those recommendations, which could affect whether the plane is allowed back into service, have already been addressed by the F.A.A., according to a person familiar with the process. The effort to address those issues has contributed to the prolonged grounding of the Max.
In both of the flights that crashed, the pilots had a hard time identifying the cause of the problems and were unable to bring the planes under control.
The review found that the F.A.A. certification process had failed to adequately consider "pilot recognition time and pilot reaction time to failures." In particular, the review suggested that the F.A.A. question Boeing's assumption that pilots could react to a malfunction similar to the one caused by MCAS in just four seconds.
One source of the problems with the certification of the Max was the F.A.A. office in Seattle that oversees Boeing, according to the report. It found that the Boeing office had "limited experience and knowledge of key technical aspects" of the Max.
In the end, the F.A.A. was simply unable to effectively assess MCAS, the review found.
"The F.A.A. had inadequate awareness of the MCAS function," which meant that the agency could not adequately assess Boeing's certification of the system, the report found.

Texto completo: The boy suffered serious injuries but was in stable condition after the unprovoked attack in Kew Gardens, Queens, officials said.
The 6-year-old boy was sitting on the front steps of his grandfather's home in Queens on Thursday afternoon, waiting for a pizza delivery, when a homeless man, a stranger, came up the driveway and approached him, the police said.
Then, in what the authorities believe was a random and unprovoked attack, the stranger grabbed the boy and slammed his head into the pavement.
After the attack, the boy's older brother, who had been waiting with him, ran into the house screaming, their grandfather, Rabbi Naftali Portnoy, told CBS New York and other local news outlets. The rabbi said he called 911, then followed the man until officers arrived and took him into custody.
The child, who has not been identified, was rushed in critical condition to Cohen Children's Medical Center, where he was treated for brain hemorrhaging and facial contusions, officials said.
The shocking assault was the second such attack to grab headlines in less than a week. On Saturday, a different homeless man went on a murderous rampage in Chinatown, killing four people, the police said. The attacks have come as New York City is struggling to confront a persistent homelessness crisis.
The suspect in the Queens attack, Laurance Gendreau, 35, was arrested and is facing charges of assault, harassment and acting in a matter injurious to a child, the police said.
Mr. Gendreau had been arrested at least four previous times, most recently in January on an assault charge in Manhattan, according to a law enforcement official who was not authorized to speak publicly about the case.
The official also said that police officers had classified Mr. Gendreau as an emotionally disturbed person in at least one previous encounter.
Rabbi Portnoy told several local news outlets that the suspect told the police he was "bipolar" after he was arrested.
The police said the boy was in stable condition on Friday but did not have any other updates on the extent of his injuries.
His grandmother, Bracha Portnoy, said that the boy was still at the hospital and his family did not yet know when he would return home.
"We're praying, so that helps us," she said.
Neighbors said they were rattled by Thursday's attack, which they agreed was out of character for the area. Gitty Acker, who lives four doors down from the Portnoys, said her grandchildren often visited and sat on her front porch without worry.
"And you know what? I'm going to have to keep them inside," Ms. Acker said.
Some residents said they had recently noticed an increase in the number of homeless people in the area, including on Metropolitan Avenue.
In the Chinatown attacks, a homeless man, Randy Rodriguez Santos, is accused of bludgeoning four other homeless men as they slept, and leaving a fifth man barely alive.
Mr. Santos had a history of violent and erratic behavior before the attacks on Saturday, the police said. But neither the authorities nor social service providers raised concerns about his potential for violent behavior.
After those attacks, Mayor Bill de Blasio said the city would send more police officers, mental health providers and outreach workers to the community in Lower Manhattan, where residents have raised concerns about a recent influx of mentally ill homeless men who appear to need more intense services.
On Friday, the city announced it would be reviewing its use of mental health intervention programs, including Kendra's Law, which allows courts to mandate treatment for the mentally ill.
"To keep our city safe and healthy, we are taking every measure necessary to protect New Yorkers and make sure that those struggling with mental illness receive the help that they need," Mr. de Blasio said in a statement.
The mayor's administration also said it would examine its ongoing deployment of mental health experts to find and treat mentally ill people who show signs of exhibiting violent behavior.
To address the city's homelessness crisis, Mr. de Blasio has vowed to open 90 new shelters across the city by 2022. The shelters were intended to provide better services, including resources addressing mental health issues.
But the mayor's plan has been hindered in part by strong resistance from residents in some neighborhoods where shelters have been proposed.
This week, hundreds of people packed into an auditorium in Queens to voice their vehement opposition to the planned opening of a shelter in Glendale, a neighborhood about three miles west of Kew Gardens.
So far, only 27 new shelters have opened. Seven of them are specifically tailored for single adults with mental health problems.
Addressing mental illness has also been a signature effort of the mayor's administration. But the city's initiative, ThriveNYC, which was created and overseen by the mayor's wife, Chirlane McCray, has sputtered.
Sean Piccoli, Nikita Stewart and Ali Watkins contributed reporting.

Texto completo: 'The Wrong Man' is a nightmare set to song
NEW YORK - A promising buzz of suspense stirs the opening moments of "The Wrong Man," Ross Golan's solemn new chamber musical, which opened Wednesday at the Robert W. Wilson MCC Theater Space in Manhattan. A lone, ominous whistle; a searchlight raking the darkness; a throng of tense-bodied men and women looking furtive - such gratifyingly classic notes of noir are sounded before a single word is sung.
Then there's the title itself, a blunt summing up of the universal nightmare of being accused unjustly of a crime, a topic that has recently become an obsessively popular subject for podcasts and streaming fare. "The Wrong Man" is also the name of a 1956 Alfred Hitchcock movie about such a miscarriage of justice, and whenever I try to watch it, I find myself having to look away as poor, decent Henry Fonda is railroaded once again.
So I was fully prepared to spend the 90 minutes of Golan's variation on this theme - staged by Thomas Kail, no less, the director of the almighty "Hamilton" - with my fingernails buried into my palms. It was also encouraging to know that the title character, a love-seeking loser in Reno, Nevada, would be played by Joshua Henry, a Tony nominee as Billy Bigelow in the 2018 revival of "Carousel" and a performer of searing emotional focus.
For better or worse, though, my fists soon unclenched themselves. It's not that "The Wrong Man" strays from the spine-tingling elements it establishes at its beginning. On the contrary, it hews to them with an unchanging insistence that ultimately drains them of their power. The show keeps reiterating its central premise, without grounding a dark conceit with the details that would give it gooseflesh-and-blood existence.
Golan is a successful pop composer who has delivered hits for the likes of Ariana Grande, Nicki Minaj and Justin Bieber, as well as a preeminent podcaster on the art of songwriting. "The Wrong Man" was developed as a concept album, which Golan began working on in 2005 but was released only this summer.
Stage adaptations of concept albums are hardly without precedent. Think of Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice's "Jesus Christ Superstar" and "Evita" or, more recently, "Hadestown," the current Broadway blockbuster by Anais Mitchell.
Yet unlike those shows, "The Wrong Man" feels like a repetitive internal monologue, one that never leaves its protagonist's aching head to freely roam the world. And there's little originality or variety in our hero's thought patterns.
Duran, the show's title character, is first presented to us as a sort of Everyscapegoat, close kin to that ultimate persecuted figure, Joseph K., of Franz Kafka's "The Trial." (No race is specified for the role of Duran, but the fact that Henry is black inevitably brings to mind recent cases of wrongful convictions of people of color.)
Duran's opening number, sung with bravura intensity that Henry sustains throughout, asks knotty musical questions of identity like, "What if I'm based on an untrue story?" and promises "an existential dive into my soul."
The music, performed by an onstage band and tautly orchestrated by Alex Lacamoire ("Hamilton," "Dear Evan Hansen"), strikes resonant chords of anxiety here. And Travis Wall's choreography, which shuffles the nine-member cast as if it were a deck of cards, emphasizes the notion of randomness, the sense that what happens here might happen to anyone.
Perversely enough, it's when the plot takes over that the show's grip slackens. Duran, the son of an abusive casino worker, is working in (unspecified) "middle management" in Rero and recovering from heartbreak.
In the fine tradition of film-noir saps, he hits the bars and runs smack into a femme fatale. That's Mariana (the slinky-voiced Ciara Ren�e), who "looks for men in designer threads like they're the Nevada lotto.' She and Duran adjourn posthaste to her place for great sex.
Alas, Mariana turns out to have an estranged homicidal husband (a nastily smiling Ryan Vasquez, identified as Man in Black), who is none too happy to learn that his ex is pregnant by Duran. Soon enough, Duran finds himself with blood on his hands, from not one but two corpses, and not long after that, on death row.
I am really not committing spoilers by telling you this. Golan's libretto has no room for mystery or ambiguity, which perhaps suits a story about the arbitrariness of cruel fate. But for us to care in more than an abstract way, we need to feel that Duran, Mariana and that mean old Man in Black are more than archetypes.
When Duran, while waiting for Mariana to slip into something more comfortable on their first night together, notes that she "still had DVDs and they were alphabetized," I felt like cheering. At last, here was a specific rather than generic bit of characterization.
Very few similar details followed. Mostly, the lyrics are of a one-size-fits-all nature: "Some good people do bad things," or "I have a history of deleting my past and then repeating it back." Duran, vainly asserting his innocence, sings: "An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, sure/But I'm not the one lying, I only told the truth, sir."
Acts of sex and violence are rendered in standard-issue hall-of-mirrors ballets, usually performed by several sets of couples. An appropriate midnight-of-the-soul atmosphere for these pas de deux is summoned by Rachel Hauck's stark set and Betsy Adams' claustrophobic lighting.
Golan's score is easy to listen to, spiced with hooks that dig into the memory. (I can still hear Ren�e wailing, "Some good people, good people do bad things.") And there is one terrific number, "Stay Positive," in which Duran on the lam feels "someone else's heart" in his chest "beating, beating, beating."
My own pulse rate accelerated during that song. It soon slowed again, though, as I went back to pondering the unfortunate fitness of one of the show's repeated lyrics: "They say all kinds of cliches here/ Like what happens here stays here."
Cast: Anoop Desai, Tilly Evans-Krueger, Joshua Henry, Malik Kitchen, Libby Lloyd, Ciara Ren�e, Kyle Robinson, Debbie Christine Tjong and Ryan Vasquez.

The former leader of Planned Parenthood hopes to bring abortion propaganda to school libraries

Texto completo: Cecile Richards may no longer be the leader of Planned Parenthood, but that doesn’t mean she’s done spreading her pro-abortion message.
After leaving the organization in 2018, Richards wrote a memoir, Make Trouble: Standing Up, Speaking Out, and Finding the Courage to Lead. The book received glowing reviews from Hillary Clinton and Gloria Steinem, but no children could be compelled to pick up the 200-plus page memoir.
As all activists know, you have to make disciples young, so Richards rewrote the book for a more impressionable audience. The young readers edition of Make Trouble comes out later this month.
To promote the book, Richards spoke with the School Library Journal, a magazine “for school librarians, media specialists, and public librarians who work with young people.”
The book is "part memoir, part call to action," and of course it's explicitly pro-abortion. She admits: “Something we didn’t do was shy away from tough topics, like reproductive rights, privilege, racism, or the heartbreak of losing elections.”
“We got help from the experts at Planned Parenthood on how to talk about the reproductive system and sex education,” Richards explained. The statement should be concerning to any parents who identify as pro-life.
As if to quell their fears, Richards added, “I feel strongly that young readers are smart enough to take on hard, complicated issues and make up their own minds about what they believe.” But when it comes to abortion, Planned Parenthood would like to make up their own minds for them.
When asked how she would respond to librarians who would pull her new book from school shelves, Richards stressed that she wouldn’t back down: “I believe in giving young readers a chance to make up their own minds about what they think. This book isn’t just about being president of Planned Parenthood or campaigning for Hillary Clinton in 2016, even though I talk about those things.”
Children are already exposed to plenty of political propaganda, from Chelsea Clinton’s She Persisted: 13 American Women Who Changed the World to Kamala Harris’ Superheroes Are Everywhere. Not to miss out on the trend, Hillary collaborated with Chelsea Clinton on a new book about "gutsy women." A Child's First Book of Trump, published in 2016, was a New York Times bestseller. Then there’s A is for Activist and Woke Baby. And the list goes on.
Richards’ new book is particularly concerning, though, as it targets young girls with the message that empowerment and strength comes from ending the life of a child in the womb. That’s “trouble” for sure, but not the kind that Richards thinks.

Trump says he does not know the identity of the whistleblower

Texto completo: President Trump told reporters he doesn't know the name of the whistleblower who triggered a House impeachment investigation.
"I don't know, but I know the whistleblower has been very inaccurate," Trump told reporters Thursday at the White House in answer to a question by the Washington Examiner.
Trump has called for the person to be exposed after he disclosed through official channels concerns about a July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
During the call, Trump asked Zelensky to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, who as vice president forced the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor who had investigated an energy company that employed his son Hunter Biden.
Trump whistleblower ID
A whistleblower complaint submitted in August was released publicly last month, along with a rough transcript of the call. Trump described the transcript as exonerating, but his foes say it proves he improperly used his office to invite foreign election interference.
"The transcript is a perfect transcript, and there shouldn't be any further questions," Trump told reporters Thursday.
On Wednesday, Trump reacted to news that the whistleblower had a "professional" tie to a 2020 presidential candidate by calling for the unmasking of the person.
Trump tweeted: "The Whistleblower’s facts have been so incorrect about my 'no pressure' conversation with the Ukrainian President, and now the conflict of interest and involvement with a Democrat Candidate, that he or she should be exposed and questioned properly. This is no Whistleblower."
The New York Times has reported that the whistleblower is a CIA employee formerly detailed to work at the White House, at one point working at the National Security Council. CNN reported the person is a registered Democrat.

Texto completo: Former Republican Congressman Trey Gowdy cannot join President Trump's legal team until early next year, the president announced Thursday.
Speaking to reporters on the South Lawn of the White House, Trump said, “Trey Gowdy is a terrific guy. I think there’s a problem with, he can’t start for another couple of months because of lobbying rules and regulations."
It was only a day after Jay Sekulow, counsel to the president, announced Gowdy had joined the team to assist with the response to the House Democrats' impeachment inquiry.
"I am pleased to announce that former Congressman Trey Gowdy is joining our team as Counsel to the President. I have known Trey for years and worked with him when he served in Congress. His legal skills and his advocacy will serve the President well. Trey's command of the law is well known and his service on Capitol Hill will be a great asset as a member of our team," Sekulow said.
Gowdy, 55, is a former federal prosecutor who retired from Congress on Jan. 3 after representing the 4th Congressional District of South Carolina for four terms. He then rejoined his old white-collar law firm, Nelson Mullins Riley & Scarborough.
Despite his return to the legal profession, federal law prevents Gowdy from taking on Trump as a client in the impeachment fight until Jan. 3, 2020.
"Sekulow's language is misleading. Gowdy is not Counsel to the President. He's attorney for Donald Trump. As such, he's subject to the criminal prohibition on communicating with Congress on behalf of Trump with intent to influence action by a member of Congress until Jan. 3, 2020," Walter Shaub, former U.S. Office of Government Ethics director, tweeted in reaction to Sekulow's announcement.
Maggie Haberman, the White House correspondent for the New York Times, offered some insight into what happened behind the scenes. "Someone in West Wing badly wanted a win internally and put out Gowdy before it was a done deal. So it was quickly done yesterday and then had to be undone," Haberman tweeted, before adding, "Undone by the president in his comments today, that is."
In addition to the move to join Trump's legal team, Gowdy was dropped as a Fox News contributor, a network representative announced Wednesday.
Gowdy had used the platform to critique the Democrats' efforts to impeach Trump. He has been particularly critical of House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, who is leading the impeachment effort.
Gowdy slammed the California Democrat for his false characterization of the July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and his possible knowledge of the whistleblower before a complaint was filed. In a Fox News appearance last week, Gowdy suggested that Schiff should be called as a "fact witness" for his potential prior knowledge of the call.

The Museum of Modern Art's Architectural Tipping Point; Diller Scofidio + Renfro's expansion is elegant, but results in a museum that is maddeningly disorienting.

Texto completo: New York
What do the airport, the municipal hospital, and the Museum of Modern Art have in common? Each is condemned to perpetual growth, to add wing upon wing and never achieve final resolution. We resign ourselves to our rambling airports and hospitals but naturally expect more from a building that was once one of the most innovative and influential museums of the 20th century.
In 1939 MoMA completed its first permanent museum, a diminutive but flawless essay in translucent glass (a material imported from Mussolini's Italy) and flowing space. Edward Durell Stone, one of its co-architects, claimed that it was the first building in New York in the International Style, which was only fair since MoMA itself had coined the term just a few years earlier. Since that modest beginning, the museum has sprawled to take up the lion's share of the block between Fifth and Sixth avenues, and 53rd and 54th streets.
Every subsequent addition deferred to the original building. In three campaigns (1950, 1953 and 1964), Philip Johnson extended it to the east and west, and added a sculpture garden. César Pelli pushed it farther westward in 1984 with a residential tower that provided museum space in its base. Yoshio Taniguchi's mighty expansion of 2001-04 added 35,000 square feet of exhibition space (along with 217,000 square feet of additional space for administrative and other needs, a harbinger of changing priorities).
All of these architects replicated the aesthetic language of their International Style model: fluid spatial continuity within a taut rectilinear frame, grace notes limited to those provided by impeccably laconic detailing, and a categorical avoidance of any structural drama, any visible play of weight and support.
Yet the original MoMA could not be enlarged ad infinitum simply by adding more International Style compartments, any more than a song can be turned into a symphony just by adding more notes. Once a certain threshold is crossed, the original loses its integrity without producing something resolved and coherent in its place. And with the newest $450 million enlargement of MoMA, an approach to planning that was splendidly suited to a building of modest scale now stubbornly refuses to cohere.
Of architects working today, Diller Scofidio + Renfro perhaps comes closest to the visual aesthetics of the International Style. Its addition (in collaboration with Gensler, the international design firm), begun in 2016, gives MoMA more than 40,000 additional square feet of exhibition space. Just to the west of the Taniguchi addition, where Tod Williams and Billie Tsien's startlingly imaginative American Folk Art Museum once stood, they have added two generously scaled double-height performance spaces, visible from the street. Farther west, MoMA spills into the lower stories of an extravagant 1,050-foot-high residential tower by Jean Nouvel, whose dynamic diagonal struts finally give some visual excitement to a block that, lined with MoMA's pageant of charcoal and gray facades, offers a kind of rhapsody in smoke.
Gallery by gallery, DS+R's new spaces are quite successful. Somewhat larger than those in the Taniguchi wing, they are pleasingly proportioned and superbly detailed. The maple floors are attractive, and subtly detailed to distinguish themselves from those in the Taniguchi wing. It was also a clever idea to move the bookstore below ground level, so that pedestrians can look down into it (although its managers have evidently had to scramble to make their wares attractive from above, what they call "aerial marketing").
One new space is uncommonly handsome. Just to the west of the Taniguchi wing, visible from outside, a continuous stair wraps around a suspended blade that looks sharp enough to shave with. Its wood-paneled walls, to dampen the inevitable clatter of heels, are speckled with micro-perforations—one of the most elegant acoustic measures I have ever seen.
There is no question that DS+R can make elegant contemporary spaces, but to array those spaces in comprehensible fashion is a problem of a different order. It is a rule in architecture, from Stonehenge to the Seagram Building, that strong programs make for strong buildings. The clearer and more specific the client's requirements, the easier it is for the architect to resolve them in a unified, coherent design. But an indecisive program makes for an indecisive building, and the architectural program of the new MoMA, along with the innovative installation that marks its reopening, is riddled with ambivalence and insecurity.
Critics have already praised the reconfigured MoMA for dispensing with its traditional narrative of the heroic rise of modernism—for abandoning, in the words of one New York Times writer, its "Whiggish movement-by-movement logic"—even as they have complained about its confusing layout. But these are two sides of the same coin. The great museums of the past, a category that sadly now includes the original MoMA, were planned so that the visitor's linear movement was in physical and metaphysical harmony with the story they told. The architectural order reinforced the intellectual order. Controlled vistas were employed so that crucial works could be seen from a distance, and brought into meaningful and often complex relationships with other objects.
It is extraordinary how studiously the new MoMA avoids the axis; gallery doors are purposefully not aligned so there is no sense of enfilade, the axial progression from room to room that culminates in a climax. But a climax presupposes that most unfashionable of things, a hierarchy, without which the visitor is left to wander through an installation that has no point around which one can orient oneself, no sense of rising action and falling action, either in its sequence of objects or sequences of spaces. The result is a museum that is maddeningly disorienting. The intense effort that has been put into signage is itself a warning sign; a well-ordered building should be self-explanatory.
At one time the Museum of Modern Art prided itself on presenting one of the great events in history, a presentation rooted in rigorous value judgments, confidently made. It treated this story with pride, reverence and curiosity. Now it looks at it in vague embarrassment, an embarrassment that permeates its glistening but distressingly insecure shell. It proudly refuses to make value judgments, an attitude nowhere more perfectly expressed architecturally than in its wish "to encourage a multitude of possible routes through the museum." But that in itself is the greatest value judgment of all.

Texto completo: Grammy winner Rihanna has no regrets about turning down the chance to perform at last year's Super Bowl halftime show.
In an interview for the November issue of Vogue, the music superstar confirmed that she declined to do the show due to differences with the NFL and to show support for former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who made headlines when he knelt during pregame renditions of the national anthem. 
He later explained that his controversial stance was a statement against the oppression people of color have endured in this country, including police brutality and racial inequality. According to The New York Times Kaepernick, who became a free agent before the 49ers could release him, later filed a grievance against the National Football League in which he asserted that NFL team owners had colluded in not hiring him because of his protests. Kaepernick filed the complaint in 2017 as several statistically inferior quarterbacks were offered contracts and he was not. He settled the case with the NFL earlier this year.
"I couldn't dare do that," Rihanna, 31, said about the halftime show. "For what? Who gains from that? Not my people. I just couldn't be a sellout. I couldn't be an enabler. There's things within that organization that I do not agree with at all, and I was not about to go and be of service to them in any way."
Maroon 5 ended up headlining that halftime show, along with Travis Scott and Big Boi

Texto completo: In a reversal, candidate pledges to run a 'very vigorous' campaign
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on Wednesday defended his decision to wait days before disclosing he suffered a heart attack and said he "misspoke" when he told reporters this week that for health reasons he would cut back on his aggressive campaign schedule.
Speaking with NBC News in his first sit-down interview since his heart attack in Las Vegas eight days earlier, Sanders signaled that he intends to press ahead forcefully in his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination and has no intention of bowing out of the race. His tone marked a shift from the more remorseful and cautious posture he assumed a day earlier, which he blamed on the media.
"I misspoke the other day. I said a word I should not have said, and media drives me a little bit nuts to make a big deal about it," Sanders said in the interview, at which he was joined by his wife, Jane Sanders. "We're going to get back into the groove of a very vigorous campaign. I love doing rallies, and I love doing town meetings."
Sanders, 78, added, "We're going to win this thing."
On Tuesday, he had struck a different note. "We're going to change the nature of the campaign a bit," he told reporters. Asked to clarify what he meant, Sanders replied, "Probably not doing four rallies a day."
The campaign has yet to say how severe a heart attack Sanders suffered or what, if any, lifestyle changes his physicians have recommended. The senator said Tuesday he will release his health records at "the appropriate time" but declined to specify when that would happen. His campaign earlier committed to releasing them before the Feb. 3 Iowa caucuses.
Sanders was taken to a Las Vegas hospital with chest pains Oct. 1, a Tuesday. It was not until the following Friday, after he was released, that his campaign released an advisory from his doctors stating that he had suffered a heart attack.
In the preceding days, aides had provided limited information about his health, saying that doctors inserted two stents to treat an artery blockage. During that period, aides did not respond yes or no when asked specifically whether Sanders had suffered a heart attack.
In the interview with NBC, Sanders dismissed the notion that he was not transparent enough with the public.
"That's nonsense," Sanders said. "I don't know what people think campaigns are - you know, we're dealing with all kinds of doctors, and we wanted to have a sense of what the hell was going on, really."
"So the first thing that we're trying to do is understand what's going on and not run to the New York Times and have to report every 15 minutes. You know, this is not a baseball game. So I think we acted absolutely appropriately."
Sanders said on the night he had chest pains, he underwent "a few tests" before a doctor told him, "you're having a heart event."
NBC's Harry Smith asked him to clarify - had the doctor told him he was having a heart attack ?
"Yeah," said Sanders, who said he "could not believe" what was happening at the time.
On Tuesday, Sanders told reporters it was "dumb" of him to ignore symptoms that might have foretold the heart attack.
"I, in the last month or two, just was more fatigued than I usually have been. And I should have listened to those symptoms," he said.
Sanders's recovery has forced a collision of needs for him and his campaign: to promote a healthy image of a candidate already struggling to replicate his 2016 success, while at the same time giving him time to recover.
Prominent friends and supporters of Sanders said Monday that he should cut back on his aggressive pace, which has surpassed his top rivals. His allies also said he should speak openly about his heart attack when he returns to the campaign - to show a personal side he has long been hesitant to reveal.
The NBC interview released Wednesday, conducted at Sanders's home in Burlington, Vt., appeared to be one part of his campaign's effort to confront the unusual challenge of keeping a national campaign chugging along with its candidate absent from the trail.
The campaign has sought to demonstrate progress and action in different ways. On Wednesday, it announced it had surpassed 1 million attempted voter contacts in Nevada, a key early state. Officials also said the campaign had booked 1,500 supporter events for October, including door-knocking, phone banks and other volunteer initiatives.
But it was unclear whether those activities would keep supporters energized and quell the questions about age and health that continue to loom over Sanders, the oldest candidate in the race.
The Sanders campaign has strongly hinted that next Tuesday's televised debate near Columbus, Ohio, will be his reentry into the campaign. The debate will be one of the highest-stakes appearances of Sanders's decades-long political career, a three-hour test of his physical capabilities for one of the most demanding jobs in the world.
Millions of Americans will be watching, if the ratings from earlier debates are any indication. He will be jumping back into the race on prime-time television exactly two weeks after his health scare, with 11 of his competitors standing on the same stage. Sanders said his cardiologist has assured him that standing for three hours will be "no issue."
Sanders, who arrived in Burlington over the weekend, has made periodic trips outside his home this week. He left for a walk Monday and made a trip to see a cardiologist Tuesday. As he has come and gone, he has spoken to reporters staked out near his house, sometimes cracking light jokes.

Jamelle Bouie: Republicans stand by Trump because they like what he does

Texto completo: Donald Trump is probably the weakest he’s been since becoming president.
He all but confessed to trying to tilt the next election in his favor with pleas — public and private — to China and Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate and former vice president, and Biden’s son. A majority of Americans support the Democratic impeachment inquiry; a plurality wants him impeached already. His defense is anything but, as allies like Rudy Giuliani keep undermining his position with their own misconduct. His approval rating is on the wane, and he trails his Democratic opponents in key swing states like Wisconsin.
And yet most congressional Republicans refuse to break with the president. Despite his obvious wrongdoing and complete unfitness for the job, the vast majority of Republican office holders in Washington are “ride or die” supporters of Trump.
The most common explanation for this stalwart commitment is simply fear. “Across the country,” reports The Washington Post, “most GOP lawmakers have responded to questions about Trump’s conduct with varying degrees of silence, shrugged shoulders or pained defenses. For now, their collective strategy is simply to survive and not make any sudden moves.” Former Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake made a version of this point last month, when he said that most Senate Republicans — “at least 35” — would vote to remove Trump if it were on a secret ballot.
The reason for the fear, in this telling, is the Republican base and its total commitment to the president. This overwhelming support is a threat to almost any lawmaker who breaks ranks. Challenge Trump and you may end up in a primary against a more MAGA-compliant opponent.
I think there’s another explanation — one that accounts for Republican behavior without casting these lawmakers as would-be dissidents.
On most issues, congressional Republicans don’t actually disagree with or disapprove of the president. They might find him coarse and occasionally abhorrent — when he was still the speaker of the House, Paul Ryan took a shot at Trump after his “both sides” remarks regarding the white supremacist march and violence in Charlottesville, Virginia — but that doesn’t mean they have a problem with his administration.
And why would they? Despite his somewhat heterodox campaign, Trump has been a remarkably conservative president. For most Republican lawmakers, to oppose Trump would be to oppose their own interests.
Most Republican lawmakers were sent to Washington to fight for spending cuts, lower taxes and conservative judges. Why would any of them stand against a president who has delivered on each count? Trump has taken an ax to domestic spending programs for the poor — his Agriculture Department just proposed new cuts to food stamps; he signed a tax cut that funnels trillions to the highest earners; and he stacked the federal judiciary with right-wing ideologues. It’s hard to imagine a better outcome for a conservative politician.
When Trump occasionally deviates from conservative orthodoxy — or otherwise bucks the party’s consensus — Republican lawmakers try to push him back in line. Earlier this year, Senate Republicans didn’t hesitate to challenge the administration on its plan to impose a 5% tariff on all goods imported from Mexico.
“I will yield to nobody in passion and seriousness and commitment for securing the border,” Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas said to reporters at the time. “But there’s no reason for Texas farmers and ranchers and manufacturers and small businesses to pay the price of massive new taxes.”
Likewise, Senate Republicans took a collective stand against Trump after the White House announced his plan this week to withdraw American forces from northern Syria, clearing the path for Turkish military operations against Kurds in the region. Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, warned Trump against a “precipitous withdrawal”; Lindsey Graham of South Carolina called the move “a big win for Iran and Assad, a big win for ISIS”; Ben Sasse of Nebraska said the president “needs to know that this bad decision will likely result in the slaughter of allies who fought with us, including women and children.”
It’s true that the Republican base isn’t invested in U.S. foreign policy toward Syria. It’s also true, however, that Trump may well lash out against his Republican critics, which could turn his voters against them on this particular issue. But Senate Republicans spoke right up. This time around, the fear that’s supposed to drive their acquiescence to Trump doesn’t exist.
If Republicans are willing to challenge Trump on his foreign policy, including the disposition of U.S. troops abroad, then the difference when it comes to Ukraine — as well as other scandals, like the president’s continued corruption and self-dealing — may just be that they don’t see a problem. You can read Sen. Marco Rubio’s willingness to downplay Trump’s open call to intervene in the 2020 election as a craven surrender, or you can take it at face value: Maybe Rubio just doesn’t think it’s that big of a deal.
None of this would be out of character for congressional Republicans. These are the lawmakers who refused to fix the Voting Rights Act after the Supreme Court killed a key provision of the law in 2013. They said nothing when Trump tried to launch a crusade against imaginary “voter fraud.” They are at best indifferent to the restrictive laws and voter purges that keep millions of Americans from the polls.
Sometimes, the simplest answer is the correct one. Why are most Republicans silent in the face of the president’s attempt to cheat his way to reelection? Perhaps it’s because they don’t think it’s wrong — or because they don’t care if it is.

Texto completo: So talented yet so vulnerable -- like all the leading contenders for the Democratic nomination.
If I dreamed up an ideal Democratic opponent for President Trump in 2020, I'd locate that candidate in the industrial Midwest. That's where Hillary Clinton lost the last election, and it's where the next one could very well be decided.
I'd summon someone relatively young. Elections are usually about the future, and the last two Democrats to ascend to the White House were under 50 when they began their first terms. Plus, the contrast with President Trump, who's 73, would be a favorable one.
I'd want someone who could lay claim to being a trailblazer and reap some of the excitement that comes from that; someone who couldn't be tarred as a Washington insider; someone who was effortlessly fluent in, and respectful of, religion without buying into the divisively censorious strains of it; someone whose message and style weren't instantly familiar facsimiles of previously successful candidates; someone who radiated the kind of thoughtfulness that's foreign to Trump.
Only one of the Democratic presidential aspirants who have gained discernible traction, raised real money and taken up seemingly permanent residence in the field's Top 5 meets all of the above criteria: Pete Buttigieg, the openly gay mayor of South Bend, Ind.
But I have the damnedest time imagining him in the White House in 2021, and that's depressing the hell out of me.
He's phenomenally talented. None of his fellow contenders for the nomination speaks off the cuff in such gorgeously composed paragraphs (though Cory Booker, Michael Bennet and Marianne Williamson have their moments).

Few of those rivals grapple as persuasively as he does with what's on the line in this election: not just the need to prevent four more years of Trump but also the need to pull America out of its partisan death spiral and rediscover the common ground, civic grace and cultural glue that have been lost.
"There's this desire to carve the world up into good and bad people and carve the electorate up into good and bad people," he said to reporters who joined him for an extended bus trip through Iowa recently, as reported by Henry Gomez on BuzzFeed News. "Trump has a way of doing it. My party has a way of doing it. And it misses the need for a certain humility about the good and evil we're each capable of."
If that sounded like a rebuke of Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and some other Democratic presidential candidates, the words he uttered next confirmed as much. "The real question of leadership," he said, "is not: Do we round up all of the good people, hope it's more than 51 percent, come together and crush the bad people? It's: Are we going to bring out what is better in us versus what is worse in us?"
He constantly plies this theme, which deserves constant plying. For him it's clearly more than cant, and has roots in his stint in the military, which throws diverse Americans together, endowing them with a shared purpose.
He routinely steers clear of extremes -- on health care, on guns, on environmental issues -- not because he lacks conviction or courage, at least not from where I'm sitting, but because extremes aren't where the most progress is usually made or where healing is likeliest to happen. He's a champion of the sensible. In that way, he seems much older than his age.
But, ugh, that age. My wish for a young candidate didn't mean a 37-year-old one. There's much wisdom in this life that's accrued only with the passage of years, and he'd be better off -- and significantly less vulnerable in a general election -- if he had even five more of them.
In 2016, I visited and spent many hours with him in South Bend, then wrote a column with the headline "The First Gay President?" I was looking at least a decade into the future, after he'd extended his résumé beyond South Bend, which has only about 100,000 people.
I'd be a lot more comfortable if there were an additional zero in that population figure, if he had a better record on race, and if there weren't quite so many elitist mile markers on his journey to this point.
And that's where my depression sets in. He's so very strong but so crucially weak -- which is the story of the Democratic primary, whose leading candidates are all agonizingly unsafe bets. Without a nanosecond's pause, I'd vote for any of them over Trump. But will enough other Americans? The stakes are enormous and reassurance is elusive.
Let's take that Top 5: Warren's plans may be too boldly progressive, she struggles with black voters and in Massachusetts, which she represents in the Senate, her support is weak among precisely the sorts of working-class whites that a Democratic nominee would optimally reclaim.
Joe Biden has been unfairly tangled in this Ukraine web and isn't as vigorous as in the past. Sanders just had a heart attack. And Kamala Harris has repeatedly failed to capitalize on bursts of momentum while giving voters maddeningly mixed signals about who she is.
That leaves a certain hyper-articulate Hoosier. "Four months before the Iowa caucuses, it is time to reckon with the reality that Buttigieg probably has a better chance to be the Democratic nominee than anyone aside from Biden and the surging Warren," wrote the veteran political journalist Walter Shapiro in a lengthy profile of him just published in The New Republic.
There may be something to that. There's definitely something to Shapiro's identification of Buttigieg's greatest gift: "When he speaks, people listen." I know I do. But it's with big questions about his timing and a tight knot in my stomach.

Texto completo: "I feel as any spouse would feel after experiencing a betrayal and infidelity in the marriage. I am hurting, but will persevere."
Gloria Chavez
El Paso Sector interim Border Patrol Chief
Faced with allegations that her Border Patrol agent husband sexually assaulted a younger female agent, El Paso Sector interim Chief Gloria Chavez said she is "hurting, but will persevere."
Her spouse, Agent Gustavo Zamora, was indicted in July in Tucson on three counts of felony sexual assault and one felony count of kidnapping, according to court documents.
"As a Sector Chief, I want to emphasize that this situation does not reflect upon the integrity, character or leadership of the Border Patrol and CBP," Chavez told the El Paso Times in an emailed response to questions. "As I visit with agents and mission support personnel, and they ask me 'how I am doing,' I share with them that I am holding strong through this difficult time in my personal life."
A female agent identified in court documents by her initials of R.W. said Zamora brought her back to a hotel room in Tucson after a night of drinking and sexually assaulted her, according to an account published by the New York Times.
Zamora lived in El Centro, California, where Chavez was posted but he worked as a senior agent for Border Patrol in Yuma, Arizona.
"Unfortunately, I am not able to speak or comment to the specifics of this case as I am not the subject of the judicial proceeding," Chavez said. "However, I have received an incredible amount of positive feedback from female and male agents alike who have voiced their support for me and understanding that I am a victim of infidelity."
The Pima County prosecutor's office did not respond to the El Paso Times' request for documents detailing the allegations.
Chavez, a rising star in the agency, is a south Texas native and a 24-year veteran of the Border Patrol. She has served as sector chief in Spokane at the northern border and was leading the agency's El Centro sector in California when she was tapped to take over the El Paso operation.
She came to El Paso sector at a crucial time this summer. The region had seen nothing but bad headlines for months.
From the beginning of the year, the sector — faced with the border's sharpest increases in apprehensions, especially of families and children — had struggled to cope. Word got out in June of severe overcrowding in a Clint border station that held unaccompanied children.
Chavez set out to repair relationships in the community, including with nonprofit immigrant advocacy groups. She announced her intention to partner with nonprofits to improve conditions for children held temporarily in Border Patrol custody.
Privately, she was dealing with marital infidelity and allegations of criminal conduct by her spouse.
"I feel as any spouse would feel after experiencing a betrayal and infidelity in the marriage," she said. "I am hurting, but will persevere."
She added, "But as I have stated earlier, I will not allow this situation to define the person that I am and always have been. What I am experiencing right now is making me a stronger woman and leader giving me a new sense of purpose. When the time is right, and when I am ready, I will guide, counsel, and mentor those women who have experienced similar situations and help anyway I can to rebuild them."
She told the El Paso Times that, in her experience, Border Patrol provides "women who are driven, ambitious, assertive and who aspire to reach top leadership positions with opportunities to do so as part of their professional growth."
The agency has one of the lowest rates of female hires in federal law enforcement: About 5% of Border Patrol's roughly 19,500 agents are women, roughly 975.
Zamora retired from the Border Patrol three weeks after his arrest, on July 31. Current CBP regulations allow an employee who has reached retirement eligibility to do so; however, CBP said OPR "will review all the facts uncovered to ensure all allegations of misconduct ... are thoroughly investigated for appropriate action by the agency."
CBP's Office of Professional Responsibility launched an investigation when it learned of the allegations in June. The internal investigation is ongoing, and OPR is cooperating with the Tucson Police Department in the criminal investigation.

Rich Lowry: Trump is still getting impeached over Russia

Texto completo: After three years, we’re still on the Russia story.
To be sure, the locus has shifted 500 miles west from Moscow to Kiev, and now we are consumed with the Ukraine controversy rather than the Russia investigation, although it’s essentially the same thing — a battle over President Donald Trump’s legitimacy fought out with allegations of foreign interference.
<img class="size-medium wp-image-2599038" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/Rich-Lowry-Color-300x293.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="293" />
The effort to widen out the Ukraine controversy, from the core of it — Trump’s mention of the Bidens on his call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy — to his urging Ukraine, Australia and others to cooperate with Bill Barr’s investigation of the origins of the Russia probe, illustrates the point nicely.
There’s nothing wrong or unusual about a United States president asking foreign leaders to provide information useful to his attorney general in a duly constituted investigation. Why would there be? Except the president’s detractors don’t consider Barr’s investigation aboveboard; in fact, they consider it another form of Trump’s perfidy.
In its report on Trump’s call with the Australian prime minister, The New York Times says — in a news report, mind you — that the call “shows the president using high-level diplomacy to advance his personal political interests.” Trump is pleased with Barr’s investigation. That doesn’t make it merely a pet political project, or mean that there isn’t a genuine public interest in knowing in greater detail how and why the Russia story got started.
The Times of London reported of Trump’s call to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson that he wanted “to gather evidence to undermine the investigation into his campaign’s links to Russia.” There’s not really anything to undermine, though, since the investigation has been over for months. Trump is basically being accused of the entirely new offense of obstruction after the fact.

The Russia investigation figures into the Ukraine story in another way. It’s not clear that even Democrats would consider his Ukraine call impeachable if it weren’t for their belief that Trump has gotten away with so much previously.
Even the framework of the Ukraine matter reflects the Russia story. Trump’s critics say he was asking for Ukrainian “interference” in our elections, when what was really going on was that he and Rudy Giuliani were interfering in Ukrainian politics.
If you accept the premise that any information developed in a foreign country and used in American politics is election interference, then Trump’s opponents themselves were masters at it. As Politico reported back in 2017, Ukrainian government officials “helped [Hillary] Clinton’s allies research damaging information on Trump and his advisers.”
Giuliani’s Ukraine adventure was motivated, in large part, by the desire to get to the bottom of this activity in 2016, and turn the tables on Trump’s critics.
There will be lots of comparisons to the 1990s as the House moves toward impeachment. Yet the vitriolic politics of the 1790s might be the more apt predicate. Back then, at the outset of the republic, each nascent political party was consumed with the idea that the other was a tool of a foreign power (either France or Britain), and believed that the other was a fundamental threat to American democracy.
Today, the Democrats still haven’t gotten beyond the idea that Trump is somehow a tool of Russia, while Republicans point to Democratic coordination with shadowy foreign forces to get the Russia investigation rolling. Books fly off the shelves about Trump being an alleged fascist, and Republicans are gripped by a Flight 93 mentality that fears if they lose a presidential election, they will never win another one again.
The Russia story contributed to and fed off this feverish atmosphere. For the longest time, it offered Democrats the hope of deliverance from a president whose election they never truly accepted. When Mueller didn’t have the goods, House Democrats were briefly at sea, until Trump’s call and the whistleblower complaint brought impeachment deliciously back into play.
Ukraine is more an epilogue of the Russian investigation than the beginning of a new book.

Texto completo: The impeachment inquiry into President Trump over his pressuring Ukraine to conduct an investigation into a political rival, former vice president Joe Biden, is moving rapidly, and developments are coming to light at all hours. Here's a summary of what you might have missed, and what's expected to happen next.
What happened Monday and overnight:
— The Trump administration has directed Gordon Sondland not to appear for a deposition scheduled for Tuesday, according to the New York Times.
— The Pentagon and the White House Office of Management and Budget were subpoenaed by House Democrats for documents related to military aid to Ukraine. The agencies have until Oct. 15 to comply.
— The second highest-ranking diplomat at the American embassy in Ukraine, George Kent, did not appear for a scheduled deposition on Monday. Bloomberg News reported that the House committees leading the impeachment inquiry plan to reschedule. Kent was among the State Department career officials who tried to shield former ambassador Marie Yovanovitch from conspiracy theories pushed by the president's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.
— Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, allies of Giuliani who allegedly helped him seek damaging information about Democrats in Ukraine, won't meet a congressional deadline to turn over documents, according to a letter from attorney John Dowd. (Yes, that John Dowd, and yes, the letter is written in Comic Sans.)
What's next:
— An aide to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, T. Ulrich Brechbuhl, is scheduled to speak to investigators on Tuesday.
— Yovonovitch is scheduled to speak to investigators on Friday.

Texto completo: "... if the president can't keep confidential some things and everybody's leaking it, that's a real problem for our national security, as well."
U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky.
FRANKFORT – Sen. Rand Paul said Monday that House Democrats are considering impeaching President Donald Trump for actions that are no different from those of former Vice President Joe Biden and other Democratic senators regarding aid to Ukraine.
"I think if you look at it objectively, have Republicans or Democrats threatened aid in the past if they don't get what they want?" Paul asked. "It sounds like that's what Joe Biden did. It sounds like that's what four Democrat senators did. It sounds like what (Sen. Chris) Murphy did a month ago. And then someone accused the president of the same thing."
The U.S. House of Representatives started the impeachment inquiry last month after an anonymous whistleblower complaint involving a phone call in which Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden — a current front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination — and his son, Hunter Biden.
Democrats have seized on a memo summarizing that call as evidence that Trump conditioned military aid to Ukraine on whether it conducted such an investigation, in addition to encrypted text messages between top U.S. diplomats released by House Democrats last week. A second anonymous whistleblower came forward this weekend to give first-hand corroboration of parts of the first whistleblower complaint.
Paul, who last week called for the whistleblower to be named, told reporters after speaking to a conference of the conservative Federalist Society in Frankfort on Monday that he is concerned the whistleblowers may have obtained information by illegal means.
"It'd be interesting to know if either one of the whistleblowers were legally allowed to, or did they get illegal dissemination of information, because that is important," Paul said. "I mean, if the president can't keep confidential some things and everybody's leaking it, that's a real problem for our national security, as well."
Paul's remarks about Biden mirrored statements from the president and his defenders in Congress and on cable news, saying Biden threatened Ukraine's aid while he was vice president "over something where his son was making $50,000 a month."
Biden said in 2018 that he had told Ukraine while vice president that the U.S. would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees if it failed to deal with corruption and remove Viktor Shokin as its prosecutor general. However, European diplomats and organizations like the International Monetary Fund had also called for Shokin's removal because he wasn't pursuing corruption cases. There is no public evidence that Hunter Biden was ever under investigation or that Biden pressured Ukraine to fire Shokin on his son's behalf.
Paul also referenced a letter from three Democratic senators to Ukraine's prosecutor general in 2018, in which he claimed the senators "said if you don't keep investigating Trump and the Russian connection, our bipartisan support for your aid may go away."
The letter in question cited a New York Times report that Ukraine's prosecutor general was closing investigations into former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and ending cooperation with special counsel Robert Mueller, urging them not to do so. At no point in the letter did the Democratic senators threaten to cut off aid to Ukraine.
Trump's allies have claimed Murphy, D-Conn., recently traveled to Ukraine and tried to pressure its president to not investigate the Bidens, but Murphy says he told Zelensky only that he should be talking to State Department officials and not the president's reelection campaign and Rudy Giuliani.
In his remarks to the Federalist Society conference, which did not wade into the impeachment matter, Paul cited the judicial beliefs of Judge Andrew Napolitano, the senior judicial analyst at Fox News who last week called Trump's call with the Ukrainian president criminal and impeachable behavior.
Asked about Napolitano's impeachment comments, Paul said, "it just means he's not right on everything ... I do respect him, I think a lot of him, I've read several of his books. But on this I disagree with him."
Paul wrote the foreword for Napolitano's 2014 book, "Suicide Pact: The Radical Expansion of Presidential Powers and the Lethal Threat to American Liberty."
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., also spoke to the Federalist Society conference along with former White House General counsel Don McGahn, with the two mostly recounting their strategy to push the nomination of scores of conservative federal judges and two Supreme Court justices through the U.S. Senate.
McConnell made only one passing reference to impeachment at the beginning of his remarks, noting that it is not a "judicial proceeding" but a "political" one, comparing it to the process of approving a federal judge in the Senate. He did not take questions from reporters.
The Republican leader of the Senate has dismissed criticism of Trump's call with the Ukrainian president and said it is "laughable to think this is anywhere close to an impeachable offense." He has stated that Senate rules require the chamber to have a trial if the House votes to impeach, but his campaign has put out online ads pledging to stop impeachment.
In his remarks to the Federalist Society, McConnell praised Trump's move in his 2016 campaign to release a list of 21 potential Supreme Court appointees – names suggested by the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation – saying it "reassured" and pulled aboard a lot of Republicans who were still skeptical of Trump.
McGahn resigned from the White House in the fall of 2018, shortly after reports that he had been cooperating with the investigation of special counsel Robert Mueller for several months.
The former White House counsel is mentioned 160 times in the Mueller report, which says Trump ordered him to remove Mueller and conceal that order.
The House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed McGahn to testify in April, but he defied the subpoena at the request of the White House. The House committee has gone to court to enforce the subpoena, with a hearing later this month.

Limestone County farmer Donna Jo Curtis tells the Athens News-Courier she already has started feeding hay to her livestock because fields are so dry. Farm ponds also are drying up, making water a concern as excessive heat stresses the animals. To help with the crunch, state agriculture officials have announced a plan to issue special free permits for trucks hauling hay. Forecasters are predicting cooler temperatures and increasing chances of rain that could help even more. The entire state is at least abnormally dry, and some areas are in an extreme drought. The Alabama Cattlemen’s Association describes cattle production as a $2. 5 billion industry in the state.
Alaska
Juneau: A Tlingit clan hat was welcomed back to southeast Alaska with ceremony and dance after spending more than a century away. A ceremony Sept. 25 included both an original sculpin hat, which was taken in 1884 from Sitka and became part of the Smithsonian Institution’s collection, and a replacement hat, which was given to the Kiks. adi clan. “It’s like seeing an old friend come around the corner when you thought you’d never see them again,” clan leader Ray Wilson told the Juneau Empire. The team-up and technology that led to the new hat and ceremony are unprecedented as far as the Smithsonian is aware. The replacement hat was made through careful study of the original, 3D imaging and consultation with the clan, said Eric Hollinger, tribal liaison for the repatriation office of the Smithsonian National History Museum.
Arizona
Phoenix: A court-appointed expert in a lawsuit over the quality of health care in the state’s prisons says understaffing, inadequate funding and privatization of health care services are significant barriers in improving inmate care. The report released Friday comes as the state has been accused of persistently dragging its feet in recent years in following through on its promises in a 2014 settlement to improve health care for inmates. Expert Marc Stern says the state’s decision to privatize health care services for inmates is costing more than if the state ran those services itself. He recommended that the Legislature’s push for privatization of inmate care be rescinded or overridden by the judge so that the state can run those services again.
Arkansas
Hot Springs: Bacteria that can cause Legionnaire’s disease have been found in the showers of a Hot Springs spa. The Arkansas Department of Health says Legionella bacteria were found within Quapaw Baths & Spa, and the shower where water taken from a spring was cooled before use has been closed for cleaning. Legionnaire’s disease is a type of potentially fatal pneumonia but is treatable with antibiotics. The health department said it began investigating after three people with the disease reported staying at the spa. The department says thermal spring water at public fountains is safe while further testing continues. The spa said in a statement that it is cooperating with the department and asked for an investigation to determine the source of the contamination.
California
Los Angeles: At the end of the month, travelers will not be able to catch a rideshare or taxi outside terminals at Los Angeles International Airport. LAX announced Friday that passengers will instead have to take shuttles or walk to a special location outside the central terminal area where they can be picked up. The move is aimed at relieving congestion on the central road as construction picks up during a $14 billion improvement program. Ride-hailing vehicles and taxis will still be able to drop off passengers at terminals, but all pickups will be in the new location. Officials say that should remove about 15% of vehicle traffic from the central terminal area. The new system will remain in effect until a new automated people-mover goes into service in 2023.
Colorado
Fort Collins: Enrollment at Colorado State University this fall sets a record. University officials say total enrollment tops 34,000 students, up by about 2,000 compared to four years ago. The Loveland Reporter-Herald reports undergraduate enrollment is up from about 24,500 in 2015 to 26,500 now. At the Fort Collins campus, over 64% of new first-year students are Colorado residents, 57% are women, and 24% of the new class are first in their family to attend college. Total enrollment at CSU-Fort Collins, CSU Global and CSU-Pueblo tops 57,000 students.
Connecticut
Hartford: State officials are launching a new health care cost-estimator tool. The Connecticut Office of Health Strategy has planned an event for Tuesday. The new cost estimator will be on the Healthscore CT website, which the office developed to give people free resources to make informed health care choices and policy decisions. The tool was designed to help residents compare what different health care providers charge for the same procedure. It’s part of the health strategy office’s effort to make cost and health care quality information more transparent and encourage providers to improve quality. Democratic Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz and state lawmakers plan to attend Tuesday’s event at the Legislative Office Building in Hartford.
Delaware
Wilmington: Delawareans love novels, especially those filled with mystery and intrigue. The most popular book in the past six months was mystery novel “Where the Crawdads Sing” by Delia Owens, according to data from the Delaware Division of Libraries. Not only is “Crawdads” the most checked-out book, at 2,169 checkouts, but it’s also at the top of waitlists, with 1,111 Delawareans waiting to get their hands on the New York Times bestselling book. Brandywine Hundred Library manager Jean Kaufman says the book was checked out 206 times in the past six months at her library, with 201 people in line for a copy. “Where the Crawdads Sing” has been on the top of the New York Times bestsellers list for more than 20 nonconsecutive weeks.
District of Columbia
Washington: D. C. lawmakers are considering emergency legislation to prohibit district agencies from cooperating with federal immigration agencies unless provided a judicial warrant or order. WTOP-FM reports D. C. Council member Charles Allen proposed the legislation, saying a 2012 district act restricting cooperation with U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement isn’t enough anymore. Allen says the agency has adapted its practices to now request notification of release dates, in addition to or instead of requesting detainment. The council is set to review the proposed bill Tuesday. Prohibited assistance would include sharing information, complying with detainment requests and allowing federal immigration authorities to enter facilities owned by the district, which Mayor Muriel Bowser has declared a sanctuary city.
Florida
Key Largo: A group of scuba divers submerged 30 feet beneath the surface to sculpt jack-o-lanterns during the annual Underwater Pumpkin Carving Contest in the Florida Keys. Detroit’s Josephine Walker and Stephanie McClary crafted moray eels embracing a heart to win the competition at the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. Other carvings included stingrays, an octopus, jellyfish, a “Protect Our Coral” message and traditional toothy grins. Participants used knives and fine carving tools to transform their orange gourds into sea creatures. They had to keep the naturally buoyant pumpkins from floating away while they carved.
Georgia
Athens: The University of Georgia has been seeking research proposals about the school’s history regarding slavery. University administrators say they’re committing $100,000 for the effort. The institution wants research from 1785, the year it was founded, to 1865, when the Civil War ended, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. Some students, faculty, alumni and community leaders say the university should commit more money for the work. Some also think the time period of research should be extended beyond the Civil War. Colleges benefited from slavery after the Civil War through housing, zoning and educational policies that continued to discriminate against African Americans, said Kirt von Daacke, co-chair of the University of Virginia’s commission on slavery.
Hawaii
Wailuku: Maui will prohibit commercial activity in parks on Sundays and official holidays. The island’s Parks and Recreation Department said the changes to commercial permits will take place in about a month and reduce damage to parks, The Maui News reports. Commercial permits cover surfing, kayaking, scuba diving, windsurfing and kiteboarding lessons, as well as snorkeling tours. “The demand on county parks has grown in recent years, as has the resident and visitor numbers,” permits officer Lisa Almeida said during a public hearing last week. The changes and public hearing followed televised comments Mayor Michael Victorino made in August announcing his intention to limit commercial activity in parks on Sundays and holidays.
Idaho
Twin Falls: A jail built to hold 194 is currently housing about 279 inmates – some crowded into an old trailer, others forced to sleep in plastic, boat-shaped containers lining the walls. The Times-News reports officials in Twin Falls County will ask voters in November to approve a $25 million bond to add modular units with 316 new beds to the jail. Capt. Doug Hughes says the overcrowding makes the jail dangerous for inmates and workers and makes it increasingly difficult to provide services to help inmates succeed once they are released. The county currently houses about 40 inmates in jails in other counties, which costs a little more than $1 million a year. Twin Falls County has not asked voters for a bond since the current jail facility was built in 1988.
Illinois
Chicago: City officials are holding public meetings for residents to weigh in on the sale of recreational marijuana. A new state law will allow recreational marijuana to be sold to people 21 and older starting Jan. 1. Mayor Lori Lightfoot says her office wants to hear from residents, business owners and others about where businesses that sell marijuana should be allowed to operate. Lightfoot introduced an ordinance last month to create Chicago’s first zoning regulations for marijuana sales. She’s proposing the city establish seven zones across Chicago and cap the number of dispensaries in each zone. The plan would ban sales in most of Chicago’s downtown and within 500 feet of a school. The meetings are planned for Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.
Indiana
Indianapolis: State and federal data shows thousands of women are traveling out of state to terminate their pregnancies as abortion clinics close around Indiana and new laws restrict use of the procedure. While the number of abortions performed in the state declined by 14% between 2009 and 2017, the number of out-of-state abortions doubled. The data shows that more than 18,000 women crossed state lines during those years to get an abortion, predominantly to Illinois. That state has more abortion providers than Indiana, it does not ban abortions after 20 weeks, and the procedure is covered under Medicaid there. Abortion-rights advocates say women from Indiana are influenced by these factors to travel outside their communities to seek an abortion.
Iowa
Des Moines: Republicans have chosen Rep. Pat Grassley to head their leadership teams as speaker-select of the Iowa House. The grandson of U. S. Sen. Charles Grassley was chosen by the GOP House caucus Monday. He takes over as speaker after a vote of the full House in January. Current Speaker Linda Upmeyer announced last week that she would step down as speaker but serve the remainder of her current House term through the end of 2020. Grassley, a 36-year-old farmer from New Hartford, was first elected to the House in 2006. He operates a family farm with his father and grandfather, who also served in the Iowa House from 1959 to 1975. Rep. Matt Windschitl was chosen majority leader and Rep. John Wills speaker pro tem.
Kansas
Garden City: The federal Drug Enforcement Administration plans to reopen an office that closed two years ago in Garden City. The Kansas News Service reports the office is reopening at a time when methamphetamine seizures are increasing in Finney County, and some drug-related shootings have been reported in the area. Finney County is one of about a dozen Kansas counties that the DEA classifies as a high-intensity drug trafficking area. It isn’t clear when the office will open. William Callahan, special agent in charge of the DEA’s St. Louis Division, says a team of six agents, who have started working, will also monitor opioids. He says the amount of meth seized through August by the county’s drug task force more than doubled the amount for all of 2018.
Kentucky
Louisville: A local Catholic church will declare itself a sanctuary in what its leaders say is a “public rejection of the brutal and racist policies” of President Donald Trump’s administration. Members of St. William Catholic Church will issue a statement on its sanctuary status Tuesday, describing the “deep faith traditions of providing sanctuary for those seeking assistance as well as what this will look like in our current political climate,” according to the church’s news release. St. William, founded in 1901 to serve Irish immigrants working in nearby railroad yards, has “long been committed to a social mission,” the release says. “But in 2017, as we witnessed the present administration’s increasingly racist rhetoric, tolerance for white supremacist terrorism, and encouragement of extreme enforcement by ICE and Border Patrol agents, it became clear to us that more was required. ”
Louisiana
Shreveport: The United Daughters of the Confederacy says a monument that’s been ordered removed from in front of a courthouse is considered very fragile and could cost $1 million to be taken down safely. The UDC told KTSB-TV it hired an expert witness who says the 116-year-old statue outside Shreveport’s Caddo Parish Courthouse could fall apart if it isn’t moved carefully. They say the Mississippi Stone Guild found it would take nearly $1 million to properly move it. On Sept. 30, a planning committee recommended setting aside half of that in city funds if the group doesn’t move the monument itself by mid-November. The Shreveport Times reports UDC spokeswoman Jackie Nichols told the commission Thursday that the amount proposed isn’t enough and contends the group never said it would pay for the removal.
Maine
Orono: A scientist from the University of Maine will lead a new consortium that focuses on the sustainability of highly migratory fish species such as tuna and sharks. The Pelagic Ecosystem Research Consortium will be headed by UMaine’s Walt Golet. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is providing $1. 6 million to support the effort. The University of Maine says the consortium will focus on subjects such as reducing accidental catch of highly migratory fish and increasing the understanding of their life histories. Golet says study of the fish, which include economically valuable species such as swordfish, can help improve their conservation.
Maryland
Baltimore: City officials and the owners of the historic racetrack that hosts the Preakness Stakes have reached an agreement to keep the Triple Crown series’ middle jewel in the city. The agreement, which is subject to approval of the General Assembly during its next session, ends a bitter dispute between owner The Stronach Group and the city over the future of Pimlico Race Course. Located in northwest Baltimore, the second-oldest track in America has been home to the famed annual race since 1909, but it is in need of a major overhaul, which has previously been estimated at nearly half a billion dollars. Under the plan, The Stronach Group would donate the site to the city for community development in and around the track and an area hospital. The company would also build a new clubhouse. The dilapidated grandstand would be demolished.
Massachusetts
Boston: Experts say trees in the region are producing a lot of acorns this year. The Boston Globe reports experts say the region appears to be experiencing a “mast year. ” Certain conditions, including the weather, cause the trees to produce more acorns every few years. Marjorie Rines, a naturalist with Mass Audubon, says there are “tons more around,” and they’ve been “coming down pretty hard and fast. ” In Boston, some residents have contacted the city’s Constituent Service Center recently to ask that street sweepers clear acorns in their neighborhoods. Mark Ashton, a professor of forest ecology at Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, says it is a mast year, but not a big one.
Michigan
Detroit: Ground is being broken for a park commemorating a half-century turnaround for a river that runs through the city’s industrial southwest side. Democratic U. S. Reps. Debbie Dingell and Rashida Tlaib are among the dignitaries expected to attend Wednesday’s groundbreaking of the Fort Street Bridge Interpretive Park. The date, Oct. 9, also marks the 50th anniversary of a 1969 fire on the Rouge River. Sparks from an acetylene torch ignited oil and wooden debris in the river, sending flames high into the air. Organizers say the fire was among the catalysts for the Clean Water Act of 1972 and major watershed restoration efforts in the years since. Plans for the park include a sculpture, kayak launch, boardwalk, rain garden and walking path.
Minnesota
Minneapolis: The local police union is selling “Cops for Trump” T-shirts after the police department banned officers from wearing their uniforms in support of candidates at political events or in ads. The Police Officers Federation of Minneapolis has accused police administrators of instituting the new policy just days before President Donald Trump’s visit to Minneapolis. Union chief Bob Kroll says a lot of officers want to go to Thursday’s rally wearing their uniforms because Trump is a “very pro-law enforcement president. ” The Star Tribune reports the police department denies the new policy has anything to do with politics and says it’s been under consideration since early this year. Kroll says the T-shirts are on sale for $20.
Mississippi
Starkville: An animal rights group wants Mississippi State to retire its live bulldog mascot named Jak after he was crashed into by an Auburn University player making a mad dash through the end zone. News outlets report People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals has sent a letter to the Mississippi college, saying it was sheer luck that Jak wasn’t severely injured or killed in the clash with tailback JaTarvious Whitlow. Whitlow scored the first touchdown of the game, entering the end zone with a momentum that carried him past the goal line and out of bounds, where he crashed into Jak, who then briefly left the sidelines. Jak’s official Twitter account says his chin and right hind leg were bruised, and he’ll return to mascot duties this week.
Missouri
Jefferson City: State officials say welfare recipients with medical marijuana cards will continue to get financial aid. Social Services Department spokeswoman Rebecca Woelfel says the agency won’t cut off help to those who test positive for pot as long as they have medical marijuana cards. The policy comes after Missouri voters in 2018 said patients with cancer, epilepsy and other illnesses may use cannabis if they get doctor approval. That put those patients at odds with a state law that requires Temporary Assistance for Needy Families applicants to be screened for drug use. If participants are asked to take a drug test and either fail or don’t show up, they risk losing welfare benefits for three years. Missouri now exempts recipients with medical marijuana cards.
Montana
Choteau: Interior Secretary David Bernhardt and Montana GOP Rep. Greg Gianforte fielded calls for better management of grizzly bears during a weekend visit to the state’s Rocky Mountain Front. The Independent Record reports ranchers, farmers and residents urged the pair on Saturday to consider allowing hunting because of grizzly attacks on livestock and occasionally people. All said they supported removing grizzlies from protected status under the Endangered Species Act. Gianforte, too, urged Bernhardt to delist the bear and allow the state to manage the species. Last year, a federal judge in Montana restored threatened species status for about 700 bears in the three-state Yellowstone region. Opponents of delisting cite a need for allowing populations in that region and the north to converge.
Nebraska
Omaha: The official state insect, the honeybee, is feeling the sting of agricultural chemicals, unfavorable weather, flooding and mites, according to beekeepers big and small. Keeping bees here has been so challenging lately that U. S. commercial beekeeping giant Adee Honey Farms recently gave up on Nebraska as a place to put hives during the summer. The company, which has almost 82,000 hives and trucks hives across the country to pollinate fruit and vegetables, had kept 12,000 hives in Nebraska – almost 500 million bees. At one time, Nebraska was the company’s top honey-producing state, according to the Omaha World-Herald. With its open ranges and river bottoms, Nebraska offered prime locations for bees to rest, recuperate and make honey. This year, the company put no hives here. Its bee losses in the state were 82% last year.
Nevada
Las Vegas: The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating a $10,000 cash drop from a helicopter over a soccer match last month. The Skyline Helicopter Tours chopper descended from the night sky Sept. 7 and hovered above 200 people gathered on the Cashman Field. The crowd looked up, and within seconds, streams of cold, hard cash shot from the helicopter’s belly and sent the people below scrambling to get their take. The cash drop that unfolded during halftime of the Las Vegas Lights soccer team’s home loss to the El Paso Locomotive is now the center of an FAA investigation to determine whether the pilot endangered people. Representatives from Skyline Helicopter Tours – known for its Strip and Hoover Dam flights – did not respond to requests for comment, but Las Vegas Lights owner Brett Lashbrook said he fully supports the promotion and how it worked.
New Hampshire
Effingham: A building founded as a school by the Masons has been named to the National Register of Historic Places. Built in Effingham in 1858, the two-and-a-half-story New England Masonic Charitable Institute has Italianate details. The building’s three-stage tower has a Masonic seal on the front and clock faces on the two adjacent sides. Its octagonal open belfry protects the 1863 bell, which was used during World War II for air-raid warnings. The New Hampshire Division of Historical Resources says the institute is the only school in the United States known to have been run by the Masons. It opened as a school in 1861 and ceased school operations in the early 1880s. The town library now occupies the first floor.
New Jersey
Bergenfield: The state’s public schools will have to test their water for lead twice as often as they do now and share the results on a yet-to-be-created state database under guidelines announced Monday by officials. The announcement continues a series of measures catalyzed by the recent water crisis in Newark, where residents in 14,000 homes with lead pipes have been given bottled water since mid-August after limited tests showed some filters weren’t adequately reducing lead levels. Lead in drinking water has been linked to developmental delays in children and can damage the brain, red blood cells and kidneys. The Legislature is holding hearings, and the state Department of Environmental Protection is stepping up its inventory of lead pipes in water systems around the state, a process that started earlier in the year.
New Mexico
Albuquerque: A state high school sports governing board says unruly fans creating problems in football, cheerleading and basketball are threatening the future of soccer. The Albuquerque Journal reports New Mexico Activities Association recently announced that soccer games are being canceled and the sport is losing officials due to parental behavior. New Mexico Activities Association Executive Director Sally Marquez described the situation as a “crisis” in a letter to coaches and athletic directors. She says the cussing, screaming and threats have to stop. The governing board said in April it was considering canceling next year’s cheerleading State Spirit Competition following death threats and inflammatory social media posts.
New York
New York: An upcoming exhibit at the New York Public Library will offer a look into the very private life of J. D. Salinger. From Oct. 18 to Jan. 20, 2020, the library will show materials ranging from family photographs to letters to the original typescript for his classic “The Catcher in the Rye. ” The exhibit is called “J. D. Salinger” and was organized by the library in partnership with the author’s widow, Colleen Salinger, and son, Matt Salinger. Matt Salinger said that while he plans to release his father’s unpublished writings at some point, the library will not be showing any unpublished material. J. D. Salinger, who died in 2010, published no books after the 1960s but continued to write during the following decades. Fans have long obsessed over what he had been working on. The exhibit will help mark the 100th anniversary of Salinger’s birth.
North Carolina
Ocracoke: Class is finally back in session on an island that was severely damaged by Hurricane Dorian. WITN reports classes for students on Ocracoke Island were being held Monday in three different and temporary locations as repairs continue. Start and end times are staggered to help families who may need to go to multiple school locations. Last week, Hyde County School Superintendent Stephen Basnight, who oversees Ocracoke School, told the board the community remains “devastated. ” Ocracoke School was flooded with more than 3 feet of water. Basnight said the gym is still a pond, and expensive equipment in other rooms remains damaged. Students have been taking classes online with iPads from the state for the past month.
North Dakota
Grand Forks: University of North Dakota officials have broken ground on a new, $80 million Memorial Union. Groundbreaking was held outside UND’s School of Law during homecoming Friday. UND interim President Joshua Wynne says the new Memorial Union will be “the gateway” to the entire university in Grand Forks. Students voted last November in favor of replacing the school’s aging student union by raising student fees to support construction and upkeep of a new building. The new Memorial Union is scheduled for completion in 2021. The three-story building will feature 158,000 square feet of meeting and engagement spaces and include up-to-date technology, student services, and expanded dining and retail options.
Ohio
Cincinnati: A City Council member wants to prohibit discrimination against natural hair and hairstyles associated with race. City Councilman Chris Seelbach has proposed that natural hair be added to Cincinnati’s discrimination policy. Seelbach says people of color have been forced to regard popular natural hairstyles such as cornrows or dreadlocks as liabilities in the workplace, housing and elsewhere. He says black women are especially penalized. The proposed law would call for the city to investigate complaints of discrimination and allow fines of up to $1,000. A public discussion on the issue with the Cincinnati City Council’s Arts, Youth & Inclusion committee is scheduled for Tuesday. The full council is expected to vote Wednesday.
Oklahoma
Tulsa: Zac Hanson of the pop music band Hanson is recovering following a motorcycle crash in the state last week. The 33-year-old Hanson said in posts on Twitter, Facebook and the Tulsa-based band’s website that he is recovering after suffering a broken collarbone, three broken ribs and a cracked scapula. Hanson said he was able to walk away from the Tulsa crash thanks to “good quality protective gear. ” Details of the crash were not revealed, but Hanson said he was preparing for a cross-country ride. Hanson said he will be replaced as drummer during an upcoming tour but will sing. Hanson is the youngest of three brothers who formed the band in the early 1990s. The band is best known for the song “MMMBop. ”
Oregon
Canby: An area creamery is working with a distiller to turn whey into vodka. KOIN-TV reports TMK Creamery, near Canby, is working with Jason Greenwood of Divine Distillers of Salem on the venture. Greenwood says whey-based vodka is not common. He says they have been working with the U. S. Department of Agriculture and Oregon State University to “perfect” the process. According to the university, most milk that goes into a cheese-making facility comes out as whey, which it says can be expensive to dispose of in landfills. The university says turning whey into protein powders or related products requires equipment that can be too expensive for small creameries. TMK Creamery’s Todd Koch says the hope is to be selling bottles of the vodka by month’s end.
Pennsylvania
Danville: A hospital says it is transferring some infants following a bacterial infection in its neonatal intensive care unit that affected eight newborns, three of whom have died. Geisinger Medical Center in Danville said Monday that four of the babies have recovered, and one is still being treated with antibiotics. The hospital said all of the babies had been born prematurely, and the three deaths “may have been a result of the infection complicating their already vulnerable state due to extreme prematurity. ” Officials say they are working with state and federal health authorities to make sure the pseudomonas waterborne bacterial infection has been eradicated. As a precaution, the hospital is transferring babies born at less than 32 weeks to other hospitals and diverting other expected premature deliveries.
Rhode Island
Narragansett: The American Civil Liberties Union says the town shouldn’t prohibit attendees at town meetings from interrupting, making slanderous remarks and behaving boisterously. The Narragansett Town Council is considering asking the town solicitor to draft a “decorum ordinance,” similar to new rules approved in Exeter last month. The Rhode Island ACLU chapter said Monday that considering such a proposal sends the wrong message and would have a “chilling effect” on Narragansett residents and their willingness to speak their minds at open forum sessions of council meetings. The ACLU says other municipalities shouldn’t follow Exeter’s “questionable lead. ” The Narragansett council president’s recommendation for drafting the ordinance states it would ensure that First Amendment rights are protected while keeping town meetings civil.
South Carolina
Charleston: A large amount of land along the Savannah River is being protected from development. Jonathan Winthrop told The Post and Courier of Charleston that his family put the 13,868 acres near Allendale into a conservation easement because they love the wilderness and didn’t want to see it compromised. Nature Conservancy Coastal and Midlands Conservation Director David Bishop says the latest gift means 60 continuous miles along the Savannah River are protected. The value of the donated land was not disclosed. The land was part of a plantation before the Revolutionary War, and the Winthrop family has owned it since 1906. It’s been used to harvest timber, as a vacation retreat and for quail hunting.
South Dakota
Pierre: The estimated number of violent crimes is down in the state. U. S. Attorney Ron Parsons said Friday that the newly released FBI crime report shows the number of violent crimes in South Dakota in 2018 dropped for the first time in five years, declining about 5% compared to the year before. The report shows the estimated rate of violent crime in the state was about 405 offenses per 100,000 residents. The most dramatic drop was in the number of murders and non-negligent homicides, which dropped 56% from 2017 to 2018. Nationally, the estimated number of violent crimes as a whole decreased 3. 3% in 2018 from the prior year.
Tennessee
Nashville: The Nashville Film Festival turns 50 this year with a new director who is expanding its footprint. WPLN-FM reports the festival directed by Jason Padgitt now includes city events every night as well as a new festival hub away from the multiplex where the movies are shown. Events range from house parties for VIP badge holders to big public celebrations, like one for a Chuck Berry documentary’s world premiere. New film programming manager Lauren Ponto says she maintained the festival’s eclectic mix of foreign titles and independent American films. She’s also showcasing more local talent, including K. D. Amond, director of “Five Women in the End. ” It’s an apocalyptic thriller about a girls’ night gone wrong making its world premiere in the Tennessee First Competition. The festival runs through Saturday.
Texas
Dallas: The NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc. is requesting an independent investigation into the fatal shooting of a key witness in a police officer’s murder trial days after the officer’s conviction. In a statement Sunday, the LDF called the killing Friday of Joshua Brown “deeply alarming and highly suspicious. ” Sherrilyn Ifill, the group’s president, said Brown’s death under such circumstances “cries out for answers. ” Meanwhile, Mayor Eric Johnson is urging people to avoid speculation about Brown’s death. He says he believes the police will conduct a thorough investigation. Amber Guyger was convicted last week of murder in the death of her upstairs neighbor, Botham Jean, whose apartment she said she mistook for her own. Brown testified that on the night of the killing, he heard what sounded like “two people meeting by surprise” and then two gunshots.
Utah
Cottonwood Heights: More than a year after she set her mind to do more to help the environment, a Utah fourth grader has convinced her elementary school to switch from foam trays to biodegradable ones. The Deseret News reports Aggy Deagle successfully lobbied the Canyons School Board and inspired other schools to consider making the change. Deagle says she hated watching the trays go in the trash. Other students joined Deagle’s effort and helped her collect signatures from about 85% of the school’s students on a petition urging the change. The school district has also switched from plastic utensils to reusable metal ones. These changes have increased the nutritional services budget by about $200,000. Butler Elementary School Principal Jeff Nalwalker calls the change a “pretty big deal. ”
Vermont
North Hero: The state Department of Fish and Wildlife is looking for help from the public in preparing some Lake Champlain beaches for nesting turtles. The year’s spiny softshell turtle beach cleanup day is Saturday, Oct. 26. Volunteers will pull up vegetation to prepare beach nesting sites for next year. The volunteers may also find a few hatchlings that remain in underground nests late in the year. In addition to threatened spiny softshell turtles, these nest sites are also used by map turtles, painted turtles and snapping turtles. Fish and Wildlife biologist Toni Mikula will have hatchling spiny softshell and other turtles on hand and will talk about the long-term turtle recovery efforts.
Virginia
Alexandria: A row house that once housed one of the nation’s largest slave-trading businesses is up for sale. The Northern Virginia Urban League owns the home in Old Town Alexandria and operates it as a museum called Freedom House. News outlets report the league put the building up for sale to shed the financial burden of operating a lightly attended museum in an old building with high maintenance costs. City officials say they’d prefer the building not be sold to a private entity, but Alexandria is not in position to take over the museum’s operation. Slave traders used the building as a holding pen for several decades in the 19th century to keep slaves arriving through the city’s port until they were sold into the Deep South.
Washington
Yakima: Hop, apple and wine growers in the state have announced they are expecting to at least meet production levels from last year’s fall harvests. The Yakima Herald-Republic reports crop experts have prepared to meet hop and wine grape numbers from 2018 while surpassing apple production levels. Growers say apple harvest numbers will be available this week, and it is likely the harvest could bring in close to 137 million boxes, an 18% increase. Washington Tree Fruit Association says the expected number does not include apples processed into juice or other products. Experts say hop numbers could be close to the 107 million pounds harvested last year. Experts say grape numbers are also expected to be similar to 2018 with more than 260,000 tons harvested.
West Virginia
Williamson: Officials say state and local workers and volunteers have removed thousands of tires from a stretch of the Tug Fork River. Employees of the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection, with volunteers and employees from the city of Williamson and the Mingo County Commission removed 2,340 tires from a 100-yard stretch of the river over four days. An agency statement says eight volunteers logged 192 hours during the cleanup from Sept. 26 to Oct. 2. The department says tires were rolled into the river for decades, and they accumulated behind a school, possibly as a result of flooding some 40 years ago. An estimated 10,000 tires still await removal, and plans are underway for another cleanup next year.
Wisconsin
Madison: The University of Wisconsin’s regents are preparing to take another step toward implementing punishments for students who interfere with campus speeches. The regents in 2017 adopted a policy declaring that students who twice disrupt others’ free speech would be suspended for at least one semester. A third offense would mean expulsion. The policy hasn’t taken effect, however, because the UW System’s administrative rules haven’t been amended to include it. The Board of Regents plans to vote during a meeting Friday at UW-Superior to approve a scope statement outlining such an amendment. Approval would authorize UW officials to begin drafting the language incorporating the policy changes into rule.
Wyoming
Chugwater: A former Peacekeeper missile alert facility has been dedicated as Wyoming’s newest state historical site. The Wyoming Tribune-Eagle reports officials dedicated the site, 30 miles north of Cheyenne, on Saturday. F. E. Warren Air Force Base personnel operated the MX intercontinental ballistic missile facility from 1986 to 2005. Visitors can tour on-site living quarters and take an elevator 60 feet underground to see its guidance systems. Officials worked with Wyoming State Parks and the State Historic Preservation Office to prepare the public display.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- When Energy Secretary Rick Perry led an American delegation to the inauguration of Ukraine's new president in May, he took the opportunity to suggest the names of Americans the new Ukrainian government might want to advise and oversee the country's state-owned gas company.
Mr. Perry's focus during the trip on Ukraine's energy industry was in keeping with a push he had begun months earlier under the previous Ukrainian president, and it was consistent with United States policy of promoting anti-corruption efforts in Ukraine and greater energy independence from Russia.
But his actions during the trip have entangled him in a controversy about a pressure campaign waged by President Trump and his allies directed at the new Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, that is at the center of the impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump. That effort sought to pressure Mr. Zelensky's government to investigate Mr. Trump's rivals, including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a leading contender for the Democratic presidential nomination to challenge Mr. Trump.
Mr. Perry's trip raised questions about whether he was seeking to provide certain Americans help in gaining a foothold in the Ukrainian energy business at a time when the new Ukrainian government was looking to the United States for signals of support in its simmering conflict with Russia.
Mr. Trump seemed to suggest last week that he made a July 25 phone call to Mr. Zelensky, during which he repeatedly urged his Ukrainian counterpart to pursue investigations that could politically benefit him, at the urging of Mr. Perry. Mr. Trump told congressional Republicans last week that Mr. Perry wanted him to discuss the liquefied natural gas supply with Mr. Zelensky, Axios reported.
That topic did not specifically come up in the call between the two leaders, according to the reconstructed transcript released by the White House. Text messages released last week by House investigators showed that other officials were suggesting that the president speak with Mr. Zelensky to nail down an agreement for Ukraine to move ahead with the investigations being sought by Mr. Trump.
At a news conference on Monday in Vilnius, Lithuania, where he was meeting with Ukrainian and Polish energy officials, Mr. Perry said he asked Mr. Trump "multiple times" to hold a phone call with Mr. Zelensky.
Mr. Perry's role in the diplomacy between the countries highlights the degree to which Mr. Trump entrusted his Ukraine policy to an ad hoc coalition of loyalists inside and outside the government, especially after the recall of the ambassador to Ukraine amid questions among Mr. Trump's supporters about her loyalty to the president. It also reveals the extent to which Ukrainian politics and national security revolve around energy supplies.
Mr. Perry's efforts, while broadly consistent with American national security and energy objectives, intersected with those of the figures involved in the pressure campaign. Two American diplomats who attended Mr. Zelensky's inauguration with Mr. Perry -- Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union, and Kurt D. Volker, then the State Department's special envoy to Ukraine -- pushed Mr. Zelensky to publicly commit to the investigations and were involved in setting up the call between Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky.
They appeared to work on the effort with Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer and a leading force in the campaign to pressure the Ukrainian government to pursue the investigations. Two associates of Mr. Giuliani also sought changes to the leadership of the Ukrainian state-owned gas company, Naftogaz. Those changes would have required approval from a supervisory board Mr. Perry sought to shape.
One of Mr. Giuliani's associates, Lev Parnas, pitched a liquefied natural gas deal to the chief executive of Naftogaz in early spring, as The New York Times reported last month.
The deal was rejected by the Naftogaz executive.
But Mr. Parnas and a partner who was also involved in Mr. Giuliani's political efforts in Ukraine, Igor Fruman, also sought to install a presumptive ally as Naftogaz's chief executive. They told a gas executive named Andrey Favorov that they could use their American political connections to help him become chief executive of Naftogaz, suggesting that, if appointed, he might steer the company to buy liquefied natural gas from them, according to Dale Perry, the managing partner of a company that competes with one run by Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman.
Mr. Favorov, who is a lower-ranking executive at Naftogaz, rejected the proposal, which was first reported by The Associated Press.
Dale Perry, who is not related to the energy secretary, said he found it "very troubling and disturbing" that Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman boasted that they had worked with Mr. Giuliani to force the recall this spring of the American ambassador to Ukraine, Marie L. Yovanovitch.
But people in Ukraine and the United States who are familiar with the conversations said the Ukrainian government had requested recommendations from Mr. Perry for Americans who could advise Naftogaz and the government on governance reforms and liquefied natural gas transportation.
Mr. Perry recommended four Americans as possible advisers on energy issues, according to the Americans and Ukrainians who are familiar with the conversations. Names floated included Carlos Pascual, a former American ambassador to Ukraine, and Daniel Yergin, an author and energy expert who has worked with Mr. Pascual at an energy advisory firm.
Mr. Perry, a former governor of Texas, specifically recommended two Texas-based investors who work in Ukraine, Michael Bleyzer and Robert Bensh, for a supervisory board of Naftogaz, according to the Americans and Ukrainians familiar with the conversations.
Mr. Bleyzer, a Republican donor, has proposed gas deals with Naftogaz, according to people familiar with his efforts.
Shaylyn Hynes, a spokeswoman for the Energy Department, said in a statement on Monday night that Mr. Perry "has consistently called for the modernization and reform of Kiev's business and energy sector in an effort to create an environment that will incentivize Western companies to do business in Ukraine." As part of that effort, and at the request of Mr. Zelensky's administration, Ms. Hynes said Mr. Perry "recommended the names of some widely respected individuals in the American energy sector, including government experts" at the Energy Department. But, she said Mr. Perry "did not recommend these individuals be placed on any board."
Nonetheless, the circulation of the names of Mr. Bleyzer and Mr. Bensh as possible Naftogaz appointments led to speculation that Naftogaz was considering removing from the supervisory board a former Obama administration official named Amos J. Hochstein. Mr. Hochstein had worked with Mr. Biden on his Ukraine efforts as vice president.
That imbued the discussion about the board appointments with political overtones at a time when Democrats were beginning to build an impeachment case around the actions of Mr. Trump and his team to press Ukraine to investigate Mr. Biden and his son, who had served on the board of a private Ukrainian gas company.
Adding to the complexity of the situation: When Mr. Zelensky dispatched one of his top aides to Washington in July to meet with members of Congress and the Trump administration, and to try to connect with Mr. Giuliani, some of the meetings on Capitol Hill were arranged by a Naftogaz lobbyist, and attended by a Naftogaz official.
Naftogaz, until just a few years ago a money-losing monopoly stained by corruption, has been substantially overhauled in recent years to survive without Russian gas and to compete in the European Union market.
To comply with European Union regulations and be able to sell Ukrainian gas to the bloc's energy-hungry countries, the company has been weaning itself off subsidies and spinning off its gas-transmission operations into a new entity with a guaranteed income of at least $ 2 billion a year.
Naftogaz officials said that this company, which will come into existence in January, and Naftogaz's operations storing gas underground could attract American investments, and that they were at the heart of what the United States administration was interested in.
Naftogaz officials said the American interest was sufficient that Mr. Sondland held further discussions about the planned spinoff of the transmission operations in Brussels.

Lakers’ trip to China suddenly includes navigation through thorny political issues

Texto completo: Tuesday’s forecast for Shanghai is not terribly different from Los Angeles weather: sunny, low-70s, little chance of rain.
But even as the Lakers boarded a flight Monday morning bound for China, they knew they were about to fly into a storm.
Sunday’s news cycle was bombarded by reaction to a Friday tweet from Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey: “Fight For Freedom. Stand With Hong Kong.” The NBA is generally a league that is permissive about expressing personal views on social issues; the estimated hundreds of millions of NBA fans in China are apparently not. Subsequent fallout included Chinese businesses vowing to cut ties with the Rockets, former Houston star Yao Ming saying the Chinese Basketball Association would no longer work with them, and awkwardly worded statements from Rockets ownership and the NBA at large.
In the middle of the madness, the Lakers are flying to Shanghai and Shenzhen, two of the largest cities in the world for a pair of exhibition games with the Brooklyn Nets and a host of league events. What was initially planned as an innocent bit of diplomacy for a league that is extremely popular overseas could now have significantly higher stakes for both the Lakers and the NBA.
Outside of North America, it’s reasonable to say that China is by far the most important market for the NBA. The country of 1.4 billion people is basketball-crazed. According to numbers shared by the league: The CBA estimates that 300 million people play basketball at some level in the country. The NBA has had a dedicated office in China since 2008. Tencent, the league’s top media partner in China, estimates that nearly half a billion people watched NBA programming on their platforms – a figure that has tripled from the viewership just five years ago. It’s common to see Chinese-language reporters roaming locker rooms before and after games, and ESPN has a partnership with Tencent to get one-on-one postgame interviews with players as they walk off the court.
Many players understand the power of the Chinese market, and it’s common for players to tour Chinese cities for their shoe companies. LeBron James, for example, goes abroad virtually every summer.
“I’ve been able to go over there and I’ve always been welcomed with open arms,” he said last week. “They love the game of basketball. It started with Yao and Yi (Jianlian) and those guys over there. We want to make the game as popular as we can and show our appreciation by going overseas in China like we’re doing next week.”
While Chinese fans have a raucous following for both superstars and a handful of major franchises – of which the Lakers are definitely one – they showcase love for players at all levels. Lance Stephenson, who played for the Lakers last year before deciding to play in China this season, recently shared a video on Instagram of the doorman at his hotel mimicking his famous “air guitar” gesture.
Joe Young, who spent Summer League playing for the Lakers, played for Nanjing’s CBA team last season. When he first flew in, he remembers being greeted by hundreds – perhaps even a thousand – fans all bearing roses for him, a foreign player who went on to average 36 points per game for a franchise that hung around the bottom of the league standings. Toward the end of the season, Young didn’t like leaving his apartment for fear that he would be accosted in public by adoring fans.
“It’s just another level over there,” he said. “Those fans are crazy.”
But in light of the Morey incident, it seems that devotion has an uglier side to it: a hair-trigger for rebuking political discourse that puts China in an unfavorable light.
Morey’s tweet touched on a nerve that has been sensitive for months. Hong Kong is in the midst of protests of mainland China’s attempts to assert more control over the island that was a longtime British territory. A bill that would have allowed for extradition to mainland China sparked more than a million people to take to the streets in June to show their displeasure. Since, protesters and the Chinese government have had countless skirmishes, in which the New York Times estimated that some 2,000 canisters of tear canisters had been fired. Complicating the issue, many mainlanders feel that the legacy of Hong Kong is irrevocably tied to the country’s adversarial history with colonialism – Brooklyn Nets owner Joe Tsai tried to relate the context in a Facebook post on Sunday night.
Morey’s tweet was deleted shortly after it was issued, but it was out in the open for the world to notice. Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta quickly noted that Morey’s tweet didn’t represent the Rockets, insisting that the team is an apolitical organization. Morey himself issued a statement saying he did not mean to offend Chinese fans. The NBA followed up with a statement that both related that the league supports individuals “educating themselves and sharing their views,” but also called the incident “regrettable.” James Harden, the Rockets’ franchise star, apologized and added “We love China.”
Outside of the league, the clamor was even louder as several political leaders criticized the NBA for kowtowing to Chinese interests – Republican Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri even wrote an open letter to the NBA asking them to cancel the Lakers’ exhibitions there.
On other hot-button issues, the NBA has stood unconditionally behind its players’ ability to express political views. On his own, James has spoken in support of the Black Lives Matter movement, for gun legislation and against NCAA amateurism. Other politically outspoken NBA figures include coaches Gregg Popovich and Steve Kerr, who have been particularly critical of the White House. Political expression has now entered the fabric of the NBA, so it’s all the more evident when the league tiptoes around a statement such as Morey’s that threatens its standing in a lucrative market.
The conflict of economic interests and political motivations is a needle the league has managed to thread for more than a decade of its increased investment in the Chinese market. This moment is arguably the first serious threat to the harmony that the NBA and China have managed to maintain. The Lakers, who sport two enormously popular stars in James and Anthony Davis, have a chance to heal some of the damage done.
Still, the larger question is likely to linger: Was it reasonable in the first place for the NBA to expect to have it both ways? That might not be so easily resolved.

SECOND OFFICIAL BLOWS WHISTLE INDIVIDUAL OFFERS INFO ON TRUMP-UKRAINE

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - An intelligence official with "firsthand knowledge" has provided information related to President Donald Trump's dealings with Ukraine and is now protected from retaliation as a whistleblower, lawyers representing the official said on Sunday, confirming that a second individual has come forward in the matter.
Much is unknown about the official, who has been interviewed by the intelligence community's inspector general but has not filed a formal complaint.
But the individual has hired the same legal team as the first whistleblower. That, and the claim of "firsthand knowledge," was seen as suggesting testimony that might bolster the impeachment case against Mr. Trump and further undermine one of his main defense claims: that the accusations against him are based on inaccurate, secondhand information.
The New York Times reported on Friday that an intelligence official who has more direct knowledge of Mr. Trump's dealings with Ukraine than the first whistleblower, and who had grown alarmed by the president's behavior, was weighing whether to come forward. The second official was among those interviewed by the intelligence community inspector general to corroborate the allegations of the original whistleblower, one of the people briefed on the matter said.
For Democratic lawmakers seeking to build their case for impeachment, the new whistleblower could serve as an important witness for both validating what they know and potentially providing new leads for investigators. Rep. Adam Schiff, the California Democrat who is leading the House's impeachment inquiry, urged other potential whistleblowers to come forward on Sunday night.
"We thank them for their courage," he said. "We thank them for their patriotism. And we hope others will follow their courageous example."
One member of the legal team confirmed on Twitter that the firm was now representing "multiple whistleblowers" but declined to say how many. The inspector general has said that to corroborate the first whistleblower's complaint, he interviewed multiple people who would be afforded protections, and it was unclear if the lawyer could be referring to those people or other people.
Since the first whistleblower emerged, the White House has tried to unmask his identity, and dismiss him as a "deep state operative" with partisan motives to "take down" Mr. Trump. The president stuck to form on Sunday evening in trying to dismiss the new whistleblower.
"Democrat lawyer is same for both Whistleblowers?" he said on Twitter. "All support Obama and Crooked Hillary. Witch Hunt!"
The president also continued to paint himself as the victim of a "deep state."
The lawyers representing both whistleblowers said the emergence of a second account should take the focus off the identities of the individuals coming forward.
"Our hope is that the focus will appropriately shift to the substance and merits of the allegations rather than the individual whistleblowers, each of whom has a legal right to remain anonymous," said Mark Zaid, one of the whistleblower's lawyers.
Mr. Zaid said the official's act of coming forward to the inspector general had secured whistleblower protections, and it was not clear if the whistleblower would file a formal complaint.
"Doesn't need to," Mr. Zaid said in a text message, adding that the person has "first hand knowledge that supported the first whistleblower."
The official has also not communicated yet with any congressional committees, Mr. Zaid said.
The first whistleblower, a CIA officer who was detailed to the National Security Council, filed a complaint in August outlining how Mr. Trump used his power to push Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, the former vice president and current presidential candidate, as well as his son Hunter Biden, including in a July 25 phone call with the country's president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy.
The disclosure of a new whistleblower, first reported by the ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos on his show "This Week," appeared likely to help House Democrats' reconstruction of events, even as the White House has so far refused to comply with requests for documents related to Mr. Trump's efforts to press Ukraine to investigate a leading political rival, and any attempt to conceal his actions.
Additional details about the origins of Mr. Trump's July 25 call with Mr. Zelenskiy emerged over the weekend.
Energy Secretary Rick Perry had encouraged Mr. Trump to speak with the Ukrainian leader, but on energy and economic issues, according to Perry spokeswoman Shaylyn Hynes. She said Mr. Perry's interest in Ukraine is part of U.S. efforts to boost Western energy ties to Eastern Europe.
Mr. Trump, who has repeatedly described his conversation with Mr. Zelenskiy as "perfect," told House Republicans on Friday night that it was Mr. Perry who teed up the July call, according to a person familiar with Mr. Trump's comments who was granted anonymity to discuss them. The person said Mr. Trump did not suggest that Mr. Perry had anything to do with the pressure to investigate the Bidens.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- An intelligence official with "firsthand knowledge" has provided information related to President Trump's dealings with Ukraine and is now protected from retaliation as a whistle-blower, lawyers representing the official said on Sunday, confirming that a second individual has come forward in the matter.
Much is unknown about the official, who has been interviewed by the intelligence community's inspector general but has not filed a formal complaint.
But the individual has hired the same legal team as the first whistle-blower. That, and the claim of "firsthand knowledge," suggests testimony that might bolster the impeachment case against Mr. Trump and further undermine one of his main defense claims: that the accusations against him are based on inaccurate, secondhand information.
The New York Times reported on Friday that an intelligence official who has more direct knowledge of Mr. Trump's dealings with Ukraine than the first whistle-blower, and who had grown alarmed by the president's behavior, was weighing whether to come forward. The second official was among those interviewed by the intelligence community inspector general to corroborate the allegations of the original whistle-blower, one of the people briefed on the matter said.
For Democratic lawmakers seeking to build their case for impeachment, the new whistle-blower could serve as an important witness for both validating what they know and potentially providing new leads for investigators. Representative Adam B. Schiff, the California Democrat who is leading the House's impeachment inquiry, urged other potential whistle-blowers to come forward on Sunday night.
"We thank them for their courage," he said. "We thank them for their patriotism. And we hope others will follow their courageous example."
One member of the legal team confirmed on Twitter that the firm was now representing "multiple whistleblowers" but declined to say how many. The inspector general has said that to corroborate the first whistle-blower's complaint, he interviewed multiple people who would be afforded protections, and it was unclear if the lawyer could be referring to those people or other people.
Since the first whistle-blower emerged, the White House has tried to unmask his identity, and dismiss him as a "deep state operative" with partisan motives to "take down" Mr. Trump. The president stuck to form on Sunday evening in trying to dismiss the new whistle-blower.
"Democrat lawyer is same for both Whistleblowers?" he said on Twitter. "All support Obama and Crooked Hillary. Witch Hunt!"
The lawyers representing both whistle-blowers said the emergence of a second account should take the focus off the identities of the individuals coming forward.
"Our hope is that the focus will appropriately shift to the substance and merits of the allegations rather than the individual whistle-blowers, each of whom has a legal right to remain anonymous," said Mark S. Zaid, one of the whistle-blower's lawyers.
Mr. Zaid said the official's act of coming forward to the inspector general had secured whistle-blower protections, and it was not clear if the whistle-blower would file a formal complaint.
The official has also not communicated yet with any congressional committees, Mr. Zaid said. But Democrats said the speed with which the case was becoming public was itself a strong sign of wrongdoing.
"What's happening is that people around the president, professionals, who are in the Oval Office, who are in the Situation Room, are watching what is happening and are finally saying, 'My God, this cannot happen anymore,' and they are coming forward," Representative Jim Himes of Connecticut, the second-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said on CBS's "Face the Nation."
Even before the second whistle-blower's emergence, lawmakers leading the impeachment inquiry were preparing for another jam-packed week of fact-finding that could significantly shape their case. They are scheduled to talk to at least two senior American diplomats: Marie L. Yovanovitch, the former American ambassador to Ukraine who was abruptly removed from her post this year after running afoul of the White House, and Gordon D. Sondland, Mr. Trump's ambassador to the European Union who closely managed the relationship between the White House and the new Ukrainian government.
Two associates of Mr. Trump's private lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, said to have played roles in his shadow campaign to push for investigations in Ukraine that could benefit the president have also been called to testify. Additional requests for documents and witnesses are also expected.
The first whistle-blower, a C.I.A. officer who was detailed to the National Security Council, filed a complaint in August outlining how Mr. Trump used his power to push Ukraine to investigate Joseph R. Biden Jr., the former vice president and current presidential candidate, as well as his son Hunter Biden, including in a July 25 phone call with the country's president, Volodymyr Zelensky.
The disclosure of a new whistle-blower, first reported by the ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos on his show "This Week," appeared likely to help House Democrats' reconstruction of events, even as the White House has so far refused to comply with requests for documents related to Mr. Trump's efforts to press Ukraine to investigate a leading political rival, and any attempt to conceal his actions.
But on Sunday, the White House shrugged off the news, arguing that it did not change the fact that Mr. Trump did nothing wrong.
"It doesn't matter how many people decide to call themselves whistle-blowers about the same telephone call -- a call the president already made public -- it doesn't change the fact that he has done nothing wrong," said Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary.
Mr. Giuliani framed the news of the new whistle-blower on Sunday as a political hit on the president. "SURPRISE Democrat lawyer has other secret sources," Mr. Giuliani wrote on Twitter. He added that the bottom line was that there was "no quid pro quo" attached to Mr. Trump's pressure on Ukrainian officials to investigate his political rivals, and called the story an "ORCHESTRATED DEM CAMPAIGN LIKE KAVANAUGH," referring to the sexual misconduct allegations against Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh during his Supreme Court confirmation hearing.
But with information evolving unusually quickly, few senior congressional Republicans or White House officials have been willing to step out publicly to defend Mr. Trump's actions. The White House, which has been riven internally about how to handle impeachment proceedings, with no one clearly in charge, did not have any senior officials making the case on the Sunday news shows to defend Mr. Trump.
Of those congressional allies who did make public comments on Sunday, several either focused on attacking Democrats' handling of the case or said they would reserve judgment until they saw more facts.
Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri and a key member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he was interested to learn more about the new whistle-blower and offered no defense of Mr. Trump's actions toward Ukraine. Instead, he said he first wanted to see the results of the Senate's bipartisan investigation of the matter before making a judgment.
"You have to assume if it is essentially a partisan vote in the House, that that sets the stage for likely the same kind of vote in the Senate," Mr. Blunt said on CBS. "But let's see what the facts are."
Others were more squarely behind the president.
Representative Chris Stewart, Republican of Utah and a member of the House Intelligence Committee, said on "Fox News Sunday" that he was "not at all" concerned by the emergence of another whistle-blower because he had already seen a rough transcript of Mr. Trump's July call with Ukraine's president that, in his view, was not problematic.
On ABC's "This Week," Representative Jim Jordan, an Ohio Republican who is one of Mr. Trump's most steadfast defenders, said the president was merely interested in rooting out legitimate accusations of corruption and that Democrats were unfairly vilifying him for it.
But pressed a half-dozen times to say whether he approved of Mr. Trump's public remarks this week calling on China to investigate the Bidens, Mr. Jordan would not answer.
"I think he has you guys all spun up," he said, repeating a line frequently used by Republicans in recent days. "I don't think he really meant go investigate. Do you think China is really going to investigate?"
Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, said in a heated exchange on "Meet the Press" that Mr. Trump had "vehemently, angrily denied" to him withholding aid for Ukraine in exchange for investigating his political rivals.
"Unlike the narrative of the press that President Trump wants to dig up dirt on his 2020 opponent, what he wants is an accounting of what happened in 2016," Mr. Johnson said.

Texto completo: The island, which has an unusual history and considerable real estate potential, could host a complex devoted to climate policy under the plan, which is in its early stages.
[Want climate news in your inbox? Sign up here for Climate Fwd: , our email newsletter.]
Governors Island, a 172-acre patch of land near southern Manhattan that is vaguely shaped like an ice cream cone, has been many things over time: An outpost of the Dutch West India Company, a Civil War prison for Confederate soldiers, a Coast Guard command center, and even a meeting place for President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev near the end of the Cold War.
Since 2003, however, when the federal government turned control over to New York City, under the condition that it not be used for residential housing, it has been an island in search of a purpose -- and in search of a source of revenue to pay for its upkeep.
Now, the city has a new idea: transforming one of its last big chunks of developable land -- as much as 4.2 million square feet on the southern half of the island, which New York wants to rezone for commercial and educational use -- into a "living laboratory" for coping with the effects of climate change.
The plan, which is still in its early stages, calls for making Governors Island "a major center for climate adaptation research, commercialization, conversation and policymaking," according to a request for proposals that the city sent to contractors and that was reviewed by The New York Times. The document says the climate adaptation theme would be the "anchor" for the island's development.
The proposal is the latest example of local governments taking the lead on climate policy as the Trump administration pulls back. But it also reflects the dilemma that global warming represents for New York and other fast-growing coastal cities: Even as seas rise and storms intensify, so does the demand for building along the water.
On Governors Island, whose location in New York Harbor makes it particularly exposed to flooding and storm surge, that tension is part of the point, according to Michael Samuelian, who until June was head of the trust that runs the island.
"Being an island in the middle of a harbor -- there's no better place to put the heart of climate adaptation and education," Mr. Samuelian said. He said Governors Island, which is less than a mile from Wall Street, should become a "visible representation of what these issues we're going to be confronting are."
The city has asked outside consultants to come up with specifics about what that might look like, as well as a "pitch deck" the city could use to sell the idea to foundations, universities or other possible partners. New York wants that work finished within six weeks, according to the document, so that it can solicit bids from developers by the end of next year.
The goal is to make the island "a living laboratory in how you deal with these issues in an urban context," said Alicia Glen, who was deputy mayor until earlier this year and is now head of the board of the Trust for Governors Island, which oversees the island.
The project is also meant to pay for the island's maintenance, Ms. Glen said, which is now funded from city coffers. "The reason why there are development opportunities on the island is to generate money that will allow it to be sustainable," she said.
Turning the island into a center for climate-adaptation research could also tap into New York's concentration of workers in design, engineering, architecture and other related areas, while engaging the public on those risks, according to Clare Newman, who succeeded Mr. Samuelian as the trust's president. "It's a potential opportunity here to bring those strands together," she said.
The city's vision for Governors Island echoes its technology-themed development of Roosevelt Island (which also abuts Manhattan), according to people familiar with the plan. In 2010, New York invited universities to compete for the chance to build a graduate center for applied sciences on Roosevelt Island; the winner was Cornell University, which in 2017 opened a campus there in partnership with the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology.
As for Governors Island, while a prudent approach might have been not to develop there at all, Mr. Samuelian said there is more value in making the island an example of how development can coexist with rising water. That could hypothetically involve buildings elevated on stilts, or structures that could easily be dismantled and moved.
"The city is a waterfront city, and our DNA is the water," Mr. Samuelian said. "We can't ignore it."

Saudi Arabia invites non-religious tourists

Texto completo: For the first time, Saudi Arabia is officially opening its doors to tourists interested in visiting the kingdom for more than religious reasons.
The ultraconservative Middle Eastern kingdom announced a new e-visa program last week that will allow people from 49 countries to enter the country for tourism, for stays as long as three months.
The visa program is an aspect of an economic reform plan introduced by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia's de facto leader, to lower the kingdom's dependence on oil.
"The Saudis already have experience with outsiders coming in as religious tourists, but tourism for culture, ecology, desert - that's new and it's part of the project for opening up," said Bernard Haykel, a scholar at Princeton University who studies the kingdom. "It's not going to displace oil, but it's a dent in that direction."
Visas were previously restricted to expatriates and business people working in the country, and for Muslims traveling to the kingdom for the Hajj, the five-day pilgrimage Muslims from around the world make to follow the Prophet Muhammad's footsteps and for Umrah, a smaller religious trip.
Saudi Arabia is one of the most conservative countries in the world, adhering to a strict interpretation of Islam, and is considered as particularly harsh to women who are seen as breaking religious rules.
The announcement of the visa program came one week before the anniversary of the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist critical of the government, and during a time when the kingdom's treatment of women's rights activists has garnered international condemnation.
Here is what we know about the visa program.
Which countries are part of the visa program?
The program will allow people from 49 countries including the United States, Canada, most European countries and China to travel to the kingdom by applying for a visa ahead of their visit or when they arrive in the country.
People from countries that are not included in the visa program are encouraged on the visa application website to contact the Saudi embassy or consulate closest to them.
How do I get a visa?
People from the 49 countries included in the program who are over 18 can go to visa.visitsaudi.com and register and apply for a visa. They can apply online before the trip or a: a kiosk upon arriving in Saudi Arabia. The kingdom says decisions will be made in half an hour. The visa fee is 440 Saudi riyals ($117) and includes a health insurance fee. Applicants under 18 must apply with an adult guardian.
How long is the visa valid?
People with a single entry visa will be allowed to stay in the kingdom for a month and those with multiple entry visas will be allowed to stay for up to three months.
Will the kingdom's rules apply to tourists?
The tourism site reminds tourists that five times a day, during prayer time, music is turned off in public places and many shops close briefly, and during Ramadan, while Muslims fast from dawn to dusk it is respectful to avoid eating or drinking in public during the day.
Alcohol is illegal in the kingdom and it is illegal to bring alcohol or drugs into the country. The site also notes that "public displays of affection are not consistent with lccal culture and visitors should also avoid using profane language or gestures."
Men and women visiting Saudi Arabia are expected to dress conservatively. Women, in particular, are expected to cover shoulders and knees in public.
"One of the obvious issues that will arise is that it is a fairly conservative society," Haykel said. "How will Saudis take to outsiders with different norms of dress? How are people going to react to that, especially to women who are not modestly dressed? Lots of tensions could arise around Westerners who are dressed immoderately."'
It is unclear what the punishment or fine for breaking rules will be. Visitors to other countries in the Persian Gulf region who have run afoul of cultural norms have been imprisoned.
"The idea is that tourists who are interested in historical sites and visiting the main cities and seeing performances organized by authorities are welcome, but they are not welcome to share knowledge, influence, political thought and analysis," said Hala Aldosari, a fellow at MIT's Center for International Studies and an activist from Saudi Arabia. "It is still vague how Saudi Arabia plans to deal with people breaking the rules - will it deport them? Detain and investigate? Torture?"
Will foreign women be allowed to drive?
Last year, Saudi Arabia lifted the ban on female drivers, and earlier this year, it eased strict guardianship laws, but many of the women's rights activists who had fought for the right to drive were imprisoned and at least one remains so.
The tourism commission did not specify whether female tourists can drive alone or with a male companion.
Where will tourists be allowed to go in Saudi Arabia?
Only Muslims will be allowed to visit the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, but the kingdom is promoting a number of its UNESCO world heritage sites, including the Mada'in Saleh in Al-Ula, which is the largest conserved site of the civilization of the Nabataeans south of Petra in Jordan, and At-Turaif District in Ad-Diriyah, the first capital of the Saudi state.
The kingdom is also encouraging people to visit Historic Jiddah, the Gate to Mecca, Al-Ahsa Oasis and the Hail Region, which has 10,000-year-old inscriptions of human and animal figures.
The kingdom's General Investment Authority and its Commission for Tourism and National Heritage said on Friday that they have development agreements with airlines and hotel and restaurant developers to create tourist-friendly sites, including hotels, a ski slope and snow-park, a water park, shopping and entertainment destinations throughout the kingdom.
The Saudi tourism commission also partnered with the World Travel and Tourism Council, the global organization that represents the private sector of the travel and tourism industry, to help make the kingdom a top five inbound destination with 100 million international and domestic visits by 2030.
Is it easy to get around the country?
The kingdom's tourism commission said the easiest way to travel is by car and it encourages tourists to rent a car. Car services Uber and Careem, as well as train and bus, are touted on the visitor information website.
Aldosari cited the financial cost of visiting and difficulties of getting around the country as a possible hindrance for tourists visiting Saudi Arabia.
"Most places in Saudi Arabia are underdeveloped when it comes to infrastructure," Aldosari said. "Public restrooms, highways, all these issues can present a challenge for Western tourists."

Texto completo: Brian Jaffe has always been a strong believer in what he calls "little-d democracy." To Jaffe, government works best when elected officials carefully weigh what their constituents have to say before making any decisions.
Jaffe, founder of the Bay Area civic engagement platform VOCA, however, didn't see that happening much when it came to local politics. As the news industry suffers and media coverage dwindles in smaller communities, residents are less engaged on local issues and elected officials are less informed about what their constituents want and need, he says.
To bridge that gap, in 2017 Jaffe launched VOCA, a new way for citizens to engage in local government. Those who sign up for VOCA receive a question every week via a text message sent to their phone on any given issue within their city. They can respond with 1-5, signaling how strongly they support or oppose a statement, and can send a comment to defend their stance. The service is free, anonymous and you don't need to download an app to use it. After gathering the responses, the breakdown of public opinion from hundreds of residents is sent back to participants, posted on social media. Then Jaffe or one of his volunteers shares with the city council. VOCA which comes from a combination of voice and advocacy currently operates in Redwood City and San Carlos with plans to expand to San Mateo and at least one more city on the Peninsula this fall. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
Q What led you to create VOCA?
A Over the course of my life, customer service in most areas has gotten better because the mechanisms of feedback have improved. The places where it hasn't gotten better is where there are monopolies or duopolies, like telecom. Everyone hates their cable companies and people don't like the airlines. But with, say, restaurants, if you're a bad restaurant, with Yelp and everything, you're going to get run out of business because people are going to review you. Or if you make a bad movie, it's going to get bad reviews on Rotten Tomatoes and nobody is going to go to see it.
There are all these mechanisms of feedback, but it didn't exist in government. So the government, sadly in many cases, acts more like that cable provider you don't like or a monopoly than all of these other businesses that are in competitive fields where product reviews and customer feedback has really forced them to innovate and improve.
VOCA is trying to say let's become modern, let's use the tools we're using in all of these other sectors of our society, let's make it really easy to give feedback, let's trust the crowd and let's bring ultimately tens of thousands of more people into the conversation.
Q What do you think is lacking with the current relationship between elected officials and residents?
A When you look at the feedback mechanisms that we have in government especially at local city council meetings things are not meshing. We have not evolved since the 1800s in our primary mechanism of feedback and hearing from constituents. We expect them to show up to a meeting at a certain time, wait for an hour or longer, talk for a very limited amount of time and then the city council has a discussion and makes a decision. It's a terrible system. There's no way that anyone would say that that's the optimal way of getting feedback. It's just the way its always been done and VOCA is trying to change that.
There are times that we get 100 times the voices on an issue as would show up to city council to talk about a topic. That increased participation, to me, leads to better outcomes.
Q How is VOCA different from city-run surveys?
A I applaud any city trying to hear from their constituents, I'm not going to put that down because it's important, but I think that the problem with this is that city-run surveys are one-off, opt-in surveys that are extremely easy to game. For instance, if a city wants to ask residents about adding bike lanes on El Camino Real, what you're going to get is all the bicycle alliance people who are going to send it out to like-minded people. And then let's say there are people diametrically opposed to bike lanes, well, they're going to send it out to their circles. But what you're never getting is responses from all of the people in the middle.
The advantage of VOCA is that people don't sign up to answer a question about a specific issue. They sign up to answer a question, period. And so what you get is a bunch of people who don't necessarily care one way or another about bike lanes answering your question about bike lanes. That way, what you're really getting is that middle of opinion that you're not getting from other methods of feedback and you're certainly not getting those people to show up to city halls. That is guaranteed.
Q Has using VOCA made you change your own opinion on an issue?
A Without a doubt, I've changed my own personal opinion as a result of reading comments on VOCA and there have also been times where I think I know what the results are going to be because I follow city politics pretty closely and I've been surprised. I think that's important, especially now when everyone is so in their own corner politically. There's so much momentum built around "I'm right, we're right and everyone else is wrong." So there's this huge gap and there's not a lot of effort to come in the middle. And I'm not necessarily sure VOCA would change that on the national scale, but I'll tell you it can bring people together on local issues, and that's a start.
Q Where would you like to see VOCA in five to 10 years?
A I'd like to see VOCA is every city in the Bay Area. Of course, I'd love to go statewide and national, but right now the goal is to be in all 101 municipalities in the Bay Area.
The Bay Area is civically really interesting because it has the three large cities San Francisco, Oakland and San Jose but then two-thirds of the population don't live in those three cities. They live in the other 98 municipalities that get next to no press regionally. So I think there is a great need for this because there are a lot of people in the Bay Area who know more about what's going on in New York City politics than they know about their own homes like Redwood City politics because they read The New York Times. And so, I think there is a lot of opportunity in the Bay Area for VOCA because yes, it's a way of measuring public opinion, but it's also a great way for users to stay informed about what's going on.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump's response to anonymous reports is leaving no doubt that shooting immigrants in the leg to keep them out of this country is fair game, and that’s dangerous.
On Wednesday, Trump denied on Twitter that he wanted a “moat stuffed with alligators and snakes, with an electrified fence and sharp spikes on top. ”
“I may be tough on Border Security, but not that tough,” he tweeted, attacking The New York Times report.
But he didn’t rebuff other New York Times anonymous reports that he suggested shooting immigrants in the leg to slow them down in his zealous efforts to seal the southern border to all foreigners.
Now the press is trying to sell the fact that I wanted a Moat stuffed with alligators and snakes, with an electrified fence and sharp spikes on top, at our Southern Border. I may be tough on Border Security, but not that tough. The press has gone Crazy. Fake News!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 2, 2019
El Paso is proof: Violent words matter
The Times detailed a March meeting where Trump suggested firing at immigrants and called for a “water-filled trench, stocked with snakes or alligators” and a “wall electrified, with spikes on top that could pierce human flesh. ”
Does that sound Trumpian? Of course it does, and everyone knows it. From the get-go, Trump has had no qualms in dishing out violent imagery, telling the world in 2016 that he could even shoot somebody and not lose votes.
And now we know he would try to do just that. Not himself, of course, and the target isn't a man in New York’s Fifth Avenue, as he had voiced on the campaign trail.
Why deterrence won't work: Asylum seekers I meet flee something even worse than Trump's unethical immigration agenda
The mere notion of shooting foreigners to keep them from reaching the U. S. border is appalling, irresponsible and dangerous.
On Aug. 3, Patrick Crusius, a 21-year old white man, opened fire in a Walmart store in El Paso, Texas, killing 22 and injuring more than two dozen others.
In his 2,300-word manifesto, Crusius talked about the “Hispanic invasion of Texas. ” Simply put, he drove hundreds of miles from his home outside Dallas to hunt down Hispanics. Thirteen of the victims were U. S. citizens, eight were Mexican citizens and one was a German national.
Why would anyone want to shoot foreigners?
Trump isn't responsible for that fateful August day in El Paso. But it is clear his anti-Mexican rhetoric is part of this moment. Why would anyone be OK with this?
Follow the law until you change it: Congress must be unafraid to follow the immigration laws we wrote
And why would anyone be OK with the notion of shooting immigrants in the leg? Trump aides reportedly kept him from all this craziness, resorting instead to strong-arm Mexico into military intervention within its territory to curb the flow of Central American asylum seekers from reaching U. S. soil.
America seems to be shrugging off Trump’s violent mindset against immigrants as nothing more than tantrums. But that’s a mistake and the massacre in El Paso proves it.
I get that the country is consumed with Trump’s impeachment inquiry in the U. S. House of Representatives over his efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate Democratic rival Joe Biden.
But Trump needs to be called out. The country needs to know that shooting foreigners — in the leg or anywhere else — is illegal and immoral.

Trump's informer is informed by scruples

Texto completo: As of this writing, we know almost nothing about the whistleblower who filed a complaint against President Donald Trump over the contents of his July 25 call to President Zelenskiy of Ukraine. All we know is this.
First, he or she continues a tradition as old as this country. Congress passed the first whistleblower legislation in July 1778 after a handful of sailors accused U.S. Navy officers of torturing British prisoners of war. In so doing, Congress laid down a challenge to us all: "Resolved, that it is the duty of all persons in the service of the United States, as well as other inhabitants thereof, to give the earliest information to Congress or any other proper authority of any misconduct, frauds or misdemeanors committed by any officers or persons in the service of these states, which may come to their knowledge."
As Americans, in other words, we are all called upon to be whistleblowers!
Second, he or she played by the rules. Didn't run to CNN or The New York Times. Didn't leak to Democrats in Congress. No, in this all-important case, involving the president of the United States, the whistleblower followed the proper channels by first obtaining confirmation of alleged wrongdoing from several sources and then confidentially submitting that information to the proper authorities: to Michael Atkinson, the Trump-appointed inspector general of the Intelligence Community, who conducted his own two-week investigation before branding the complaint "credible" and "of urgent concern;" and, from him, to Joseph Maguire, the Trump-appointed director of National Intelligence, who told Congress: "I think the whistleblower did the right thing. I think he followed the law every step of the way."
Third, and most significantly, he or she exposed "a serious or flagrant problem, abuse, or violation of law or Executive Order" that every American should be concerned about: namely, as stated in the official complaint, "that the President of the United States is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election."
So venerable is the tradition of whistleblowers, you'd think they'd be treated as patriots. Sadly, that's not always the case. More often, in fact, whether exposing government or corporate wrongdoing, they've been called "rats," "snitches," "media whores," "money grubbers," or worse. Many have lost their jobs for daring to follow their conscience and speak up.
But none has experienced the torrent of abuse aimed at today's whistleblower.
Several times a day, for the last two weeks, he or she's been accused of treason - by none other than the president of the United States, who's vowed to expose the whistleblower's identify so he can attack him or her personally. Trump's also called the whistleblower a spy, for whom hanging or shooting remains the only proper punishment.
"You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart with spies and treason, right," he told members of the U.S. mission to the UN.
Trump has accused the whistleblower of having no firsthand knowledge of his call. Which has been contradicted by Inspector General Atkinson: "The whistleblower stated on the form that he or she possessed both firsthand and other information."
Trump also insists the whistleblower's not telling the truth, even though he has admitted asking Zelenskiy to dig up dirt on Joe Biden, which is confirmed by White House notes on the call.
But, notice. Trump never answers the basic question: Why is it OK for a president to invite a foreign government to intervene in an American presidential election? He won't answer that question because he can't. There's no way he can justify or defend what is, in fact, an act of treason.
We don't know if the inquiry underway will lead to Trump's impeachment. But we know how it started. By a career intelligence officer who's worried about this president undermining our sacred election process.
We don't know if that whistleblower's a man or woman. We don't know his or her name. We don't know where he or she works. All we know is there's one brave American who still cares enough about the difference between right and wrong - and is willing to risk everything in order to right that wrong. God bless America. Even knowing as little as we do, I'm already prepared to erect a monument to that whistleblower on the Washington Mall. Or, better yet, in front of the Trump Hotel.

CHS Inc. admits to role in bribes

Texto completo: Mexican customs brokers paid bribes to help expedite international rail shipments for CHS Inc., the giant Inver Grove Heights-based agribusiness cooperative has admitted as part of an ongoing lawsuit.
CHS also confirmed possible violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act to the federal Securities and Exchange Commission, acknowledging that its employees paid a "small number of reimbursements" to customs brokers for bribes they paid to Mexican government officials in 2014 and 2015. The payments involved the inspection of grain crossing the U.S.-Mexican border in rail cars.
The company said it is cooperating with federal investigators, adding that it is "unable at this time to predict when our government agencies' review of these matters will be completed or what regulatory or other outcomes may result."
The bribes represent the second breakdown in internal
controls at CHS to come to light in recent months.
A year ago, CHS, a Fortune 100 company, reported that a freight trader at the company had intentionally inflated the value of the firm's rail-freight contracts, helping to overstate the company's profits by $190 million over four fiscal years.
That led to the firing of the employee, a shake-up in the firm's rail transportation division and an adjustment in CHS' annual financial results.
The latest disclosures show how tempting it can be for companies and government officials on both sides of the border to engage in bribery. A 2016 investigation by the New York Times showed that almost 200 employees and contract workers of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security took nearly $15 million in bribes over 10 years.
Details of the bribes paid by CHS emerged in a lawsuit filed this year in Dakota County by former employee Dawn Harvieux, alleging that CHS violated the Minnesota Whistleblower Act by firing her because she reported failings in the company's "anti-bribery and internal controls" system.
CHS has moved to dismiss the lawsuit, arguing that Harvieux failed to notice or alert upper management that bribery was built into a contract she helped put together. The company also contends that Harvieux is not a whistleblower because an internal investigation into the bribes was launched before she reported anything.
CHS regularly ships grain to Mexico, where the shipments face border inspections for contamination. If a rail car is deemed "contaminated" by bugs, for example, it is detained and not allowed to cross until it is fumigated, costing CHS time and money.
Harvieux, an analyst in CHS' grain marketing division, worked on a contract in 2017 to formalize fees with customs brokers to help move grain shipments over the border.
The agreement, which she worked on with several other CHS employees, included an option that called for CHS to pay a $2,000 "re-inspection fee" for a second inspection of any rail cars held for possible contamination. If a rail car passed the second inspection, the fumigation cost could be avoided.
CHS said its compliance department determined that the "re-inspection fee" was actually a bribe aimed at persuading Mexican officials to release detained rail cars.
Much of the court case centers on whether Harvieux was wrongfully fired. Her attorneys declined to comment on Friday.
In her suit, Harvieux said a contract that provided for bribing Mexican officials was approved by John Griffith, senior vice president for global grain marketing and renewable fuels for CHS. She said that she verified a translation of proposed rate information from two Mexican customs brokerages for the contract and vetted the brokerages through a CHS vetting system.
In the spring of 2017, she said, she "hand delivered" the agreements, including the rate information that spelled out the "re-inspection fee," to Griffith, who later signed them.
Soon after, Harvieux said in the suit, Jessica Cossalter, director of global trade programs and compliance at CHS, told Harvieux that one of the brokerages was not approved by CHS compliance and that one of them employed a person with a serious criminal record in Mexico.
Harvieux said she was interviewed twice and cooperated fully in an internal investigation. She was fired in February 2018, along with two other employees who worked as Latin American marketing managers.
Harvieux said in her lawsuit that one of the other fired employees told Griffith that CHS was aware that one or more Mexican customs brokers had been using CHS funds to pay bribes. Griffith's response, according to Harvieux's suit: "There is no smoking gun here. Don't talk about this again."
CHS, in its motion to dismiss the suit, said that its investigation was launched independent of Harvieux and that she never blew a whistle or reported a red flag. The company argued that she "did not critically review" the fee schedules she worked on, but instead only verified the Spanish-to-English translations of the contract and failed to identify the fact that the "re-inspection fee" was a bribe.
"After apparently concluding that her only role as an export analyst in reviewing contracts with proposed Mexican customs agents was to ensure they were properly translated, Harvieux reported nothing and simply asked Griffith to sign a contract that would have required CHS to reimburse the agent for the payment of bribes," CHS said in a court filing.
Once CHS realized the "re-inspection fee" set out in the contract was a bribe, it prohibited use of that customs broker, the company said in the filing.
CHS officials declined to comment, citing the pending litigation. In a statement, CHS said it "remains committed to operating in compliance with laws that apply to our business."

Texto completo: Several things came to mind as I read and pondered the Sept. 27 letter to the editor, “Lower rate, wider base.” The writer proposed a flat tax in order to lower taxes on the wealthy instead of the tax increases which have been suggested by some politicians.
My first thought was that many conservatives and some others care more about high taxes on a few of the rich than they do about the deficits and huge debt we’re leaving for millions of future Americans.
Secondly, I realized we are also leaving a very daunting legacy for future generations on our planet in the form of the global climate crisis.
Lastly, the reason for our inability to face both problems is because we know the solutions will require us to sacrifice some of our comforts.
Fortunately, these two challenges give us a chance to replace our foolhardy fixation on our own standards of living with a more principled dedication to our personal and community standards of character.
Because we already know, or we will soon find out, that a high standard of living cannot save our country nor our Earth. Only a high standard of character can.

Heavy on declarations, light on evidence
Do not be taken in my pieces such as Hugh Hewitt’s column, “Impeachment-minded Democrats, welcome to Al Capone’s vault” (9/27/19). If you are unfamiliar with Hewitt’s Salem radio show, are impressed with Hewitt’s credentials as “author of 14 books about politics, history and faith” and “professor of law at Chapman University Law School” and ”president of the Nixon Foundation,” and are sympathetic to his views about President Trump, as many are, you might miss these salient facts:
1. The column is a series of declarations without any supporting facts or evidence, such as “… the hugely hyped rough transcript of the president’s phone call has turned out to be a nothingburger,” and “People are wising up to the striking similarities in these (anti-Trump) tales, which are populated with unnamed accusers and eyebrow-raising tactics.” In addition, Hewitt dismisses the obstruction of justice findings in Volume II of the Mueller report by simply citing Attorney General Barr’s conclusion about it, without even mentioning the tension between the two.
2. Most importantly, Hewitt gives away the game by not addressing the crux of the issue. The issue can be summarized as: Do the president’s arguably extortionate actions in the phone call to Zelensky, and the unsuccessful attempt to keep the fallout (the whistleblower complaint and the transcript) from the Congress and the public, amount to a high crime or misdemeanor? This is a debatable point; many would argue that these things do not satisfy that criterion, and there are legitimate arguments on both sides. But search Hewitt’s column front to back, as I did, and you will not find a discussion of this exact point.
I have listened to Hewitt on the radio for many hours, and it is exactly the same there as here. He paints himself as, and sounds like, a reasonable and debate-savvy center-right intellectual (a phrase that shows up in this column as well), but he is just a shill for Trump. This column is a clinic in the use of propaganda — heavy on declarations, but light on evidence, reasoning and analysis. If you are sympathetic to Trump’s views, you would do much better to study Republican scholars such as George Will (Washington Post) or Ross Douthat (New York Times).

Texto completo: URBANA -- The city of Urbana is looking to citizens to donate money to replace trees lost in a late spring tornado.

The city announced Wednesday that the F-1 tornado that hit southwest Urbana on May 26 cost Urbana more than $131,000 to clean up. Another $22,000 will be needed to replace the 64 trees lost that Sunday morning.

Vince Gustafson, a deputy director in public works, praised the efforts of city employees who quickly responded to the storm that severely impacted two residential areas. It's estimated they put in about 1,543 hours on clean-up.

"Now we are faced with replacing the damaged and destroyed trees in order to maintain our urban forest," said Mayor Diane Marlin, whose own neighborhood was affected by downed trees, damaged fences and roofs.

"We had made excellent progress addressing the tree-planting backlog following losses due to the emerald ash borer. The tornado has set us back. Many community members benefited from the city's efforts to remove debris -- even the substantial amount of debris that came from private property. Now we are asking the community to help."

The city estimates the cost to replace a tree at $360 -- $110 for the tree and another $250 for the labor to plant it. That brings the total cost of replacing the 61 trees to $21,960.

Another 89 trees were considered seriously damaged, the city said.

Community members, business owners or organizations wishing to donate to the tree-planting effort can do so through the Community Foundation of East Central Illinois (cfeci.org). Click on "Donate to CFECI" and be sure to designate "City of Urbana Trees" when making your donation.

UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS

Black Chorus' fall concert is Sunday

URBANA -- The University of Illinois Black Chorus will present its annual fall concert -- "Yet With a Steady Beat: Since 1619" -- at 3 p.m. Sunday in the Foellinger Great Hall of Krannert Center for the Performing Arts.

This concert is a continuation of the celebration of the choir's 50-year legacy of campus, led for nearly 40 years by Professor of Music Ollie Watts Davis.

Over the years, it's hard to imagine the chorus without its conductor.

She has a national reputation, and in her 1990 Carnegie Hall debut, the New York Times praised her "lovely, warm, admirably focused tone."

Davis has performed in Venezuela, the Canary Islands and Spain, among other spots around the world.

Sunday's offerings will include spirituals, recitations, hymns, anthems and gospel, with songs written by K. Edward Copeland, Brian Courtney Wilson, V. Michael McKay and A. Jeffrey LaValley.

A special "we remember" tribute will be paid to Legacy Artist Minister Thomas Whitfield, who was here in the late 1980s.

Tickets are $15 and available at Krannert's ticket office. For more, call 217-333-6280.

CHAMPAIGN POLICE DEPARTMENT

Social media threat investigated

CHAMPAIGN -- Champaign police said a preliminary investigation found a social media threat toward Centennial High School to be not credible.

Still, there was an increased police presence at the school Wednesday.

CPD spokesperson Tom Yelich said investigators were also looking into several fights that broke out Tuesday at Centennial, where multiple people were intentionally struck. Yelich said Wednesday it wasn't known whether the fights were connected to the social media threat, which was discovered Tuesday night. No arrests have been made in either incident, and police are investigating.

Unit 4 spokesperson John Lyday said school administrators sent a message about the threat to parents "out of an abundance of caution." He said the school was not placed on lockdown, and classes continue to be held during homecoming week.

BLUE RIDGE SCHOOL DISTRICT

Board, union 2% apart on raises

FARMER CITY -- The Blue Ridge school board and the district employees union are 2 percent apart on raises, with a difference of about $170,000 in total wages and benefits for district workers in 2019-20.

Those figures are included in public postings that will appear online by Monday on the Illinois Educational Labor Relations Board website. The proposals were provided this week to News-Gazette Media's Piatt County Journal-Republican.

The school board is proposing raises of 2.25 percent for 2019-20 and 2 percent each of the next two years. The Blue Ridge Federation of Teachers is proposing 4.25 percent in raises this school year, and has not provided figures for a three-year agreement.

"Though we are willing to consider a multi-year contract, the board has not yet offered a multi-year proposal that we would consider," said federation President Don Anton.

The postings show the district originally offered 1 percent raises when negotiations began in February, while the union came in at 4.75 percent. Ten negotiating sessions later, teachers are preparing for a strike, which could occur as soon as Oct. 21.

Public posting of the latest offers is part of the required procedure for 110 district teachers and support personnel to walk out.

The two sides are also at odds concerning school district contributions toward health savings accounts. When a high-deductible plan was implemented, $3,000 was donated annually per full-time covered employee, but that figure dropped to $1,904 in 2018-19. Teachers want that to increase to $2,750, while the district is proposing $2,100 in the first year, rising to $2,500 in the third year of an agreement.

Employees have been working without a contract since July 1.

A third session with an outside mediator is scheduled for Wednesday.

AROUND THE AREA

Hydrant flushing prompts advisory

* GIBSON CITY: The Gibson City Water Department will begin flushing fire hydrants on Oct. 13, and residents are advised that the work could result in rusty water at times. "Please flush any dirty water out of your water line before using," advised public works Superintendent Randy Stauffer. "If the dirty water does not flush out after a few minutes, please stop flushing, wait a while and try again."

* MONTICELLO: U.S. Rep. Rodney Davis, R-Taylorville, will hold office hours next week at the Monticello Municipal Building, 210 N. Hamilton St. From 1:30 to 3 p.m. Monday, Davis plans to meet with constituents individually or in small groups for up to 10 minutes "about issues important to them." Meetings will be taken on a first-come, first-served basis.

* RANTOUL: The Rantoul City Schools district's 2019-20 budget shows a surplus of almost $1.3 million, which Superintendent Michelle Ramage attributed in large part to the late arrival of property tax payments from Champaign County.

Sturgill Simpson releases blazing new rock record

Texto completo: Listeners hungry for Sturgill Simpson's familiar croon better keep feasting on the old stuff – because the Kentucky songwriter's new album trades country comfort for all-out helping of rock 'n' roll grime.
On his new album "Sound & Fury," Simpson steps firmly away from the outlaw country sound where some once considered him a torchbearer. Instead, he ventures deep into the underbelly of fuzzy, futuristic guitar rock.
Simpson recorded "Sound & Fury" at Michigan's McGuire Motor Inn, working alongside bandmates Bobby Emmett, Chuck Bartels and Miles Miller. John Hill, known for his work with Portugal. The Man and Cage The Elephant, co-produced the album.
And, if Simpson tapping into a no-nonsense dystopian soundscape wasn't enough, Simpson teamed with leading names in anime to team the 40-minute stack of new tunes with a Netflix film of the same name.
How's the album sound? And what can you expect from the Netflix film? Here's what we know about "Sound & Fury."
'Sound & Fury,' the album Simpson's 10-track "Sound & Fury" follows the subtle country storytelling of 2016's "A Sailor's Guide To Earth," which earned the major label newcomer international acclaim – including an unexpected nomination for Album of the Year at the 2017 Grammy Awards (he'd fall to Adele, but brought home Best Country Album that year).
As outlined in a New York Times profile earlier this month, Simpson found "Sound & Fury" by way of Nashville nonconformity, worn-down months on the road ("There was a point in 2017 where I thought I was just going to just go away," he said) and the immobile weeks after a sinus surgery that led him to rediscover the music of his formidable years.
In his time recovering from surgery, Simpson told Apple Music's Zane Lowe that he turned to hip-hop, the Cars and Black Sabbath, each influencing the rip-roaring sound that boils with audacity and swagger on "Sound & Fury."
A cathartic output, Simpson told the Times he wanted it to hit "like a Wu-Tang record." From the article:
"I could've very easily probably made the same record five times by now and just gone right down that middle lane and played it safe, and I'd have $80 million in the bank," Simpson said, dryly. "And I'd probably be hanging from a (expletive) rope on one of these trees over here by now, you know what I mean? So it's not worth it."
The result? A sonic onslaught that explores galaxies between genre.
Simpson blurs between disco itches and gritty guitar scratches on the album. There's the groove of instrumental opener, "Ronin;" The slick, funky flair of "A Good Look;" southern-soaked bombast with closer "Fastest Horse In Town;" and an ode to longing, reflective guitar-pop with six-minute album standout "Make Art Not Friends."
On the subtly spacey "Mercury In Retrograde," Simpson sings to the dog-and-pony show that once greeted his rising success.
On his new album "Sound & Fury," Sturgill Simpson steps firmly away from the outlaw country sound where some once considered him a torchbearer.

Samin Nosrat mulls going part-time vegan

Texto completo: Samin Nosrat's laugh is delightful and infectious. It's the kind of warm uninhibited chorus that makes you feel not only like you've known the New York Times best-selling author for years, but also that she couldn't be more happy to talk with you today. This charming, approachable persona is an undeniable part of the reason why Nostrat's Netflix series "Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat" — inspired by her James Beard Award-winning book of the same name — has been hailed for changing the food show landscape forever. In the four-part series, viewers see Nosrat lose herself in the pleasure of a piece of aged Parmesan cheese, giggle as her eyes water while chopping onions and do an adorable happy dance with a friend as they devour a dish while standing around the kitchen counter. It's a show that's as much about food, where it comes from and how to make it, as it is about watching someone simply enjoy it. The show premiered on the streaming platform almost a year ago, and Nosrat's been busy in the intervening months. She's already begun work on a second series and thinking about her next book, "What to Cook." She's also hitting the road, crisscrossing the country for evening events during which she chats with local hosts about food, cooking and anything else that might come up when she fields questions from the audience. We chatted with the author, TV star and chef about what fans can expect.
Question: So, what can people expect from this tour?
Answer: We basically laugh a lot (laughs) and then, I mean, each conversation is different, which is something I really love about it.
One thing I'm really excited about that is that I edited this year's edition of "Best American Food Writing." I was pretty riled up when I was doing the editing and writing the forward but what I'm excited about is I think it will rile people up when they read it. I did my best to highlight all sorts of different issues beyond what we just consider to be food and I'm really excited to get to talk about the wonderful diversity of the writing.
The other thing I'm thinking so much about is climate change and how food affects and is affected by it.
I have been reading a lot about climate change and agriculture and food and I feel like — and I'm so hesitant to say this, but I gotta start saying it somewhere — I feel like the only responsible thing for me to do is become a daytime vegan. And I really don't want to. Like I really don't want to but I feel like it's something I have to do and I feel like it's what I need to, not necessarily bully other people into doing, but at least model for people. Changing out diets is the single most powerful thing we as individuals can do.
It's both depressing and exciting. (laughs)
Why getting a show was a 'whiplash moment' Q: It sounds like you maybe have been thinking about using your platform to be an activist? Or raise awareness, maybe?
A: I wouldn't use the word "activist." I still do have a relationship with the New York Times so I have not fully jumped into activism. But I do think education and awareness is really important and it's my job.
I found out that Netflix was interested in the show two days after the 2016 election and it was a really hard time for me. I really felt that that election said to me, personally, that people who look like you are not wanted here. So I was sort of sitting with the grief of that and then found out this thing two days later.
It was a really whiplash moment for me and I took it really seriously and thought really carefully about whether I wanted to put myself in the public eye when the public had made it clear that people who look like me or are from the part of the world that my family is from are not necessarily considered American or welcome here.
I did in the end decide that I did want to do it and I was like, OK if I am going to do this then I'm going to use it to promote the kind of message that's really important to me, which is one of unity and sharing with people my ultimate belief that we are more similar than different across the world.
So I don't know that I would use the word "activist" necessarily, but I do think that there are so many things in our daily lives that feel really overwhelming. Changing a habit is really hard. I get how hard it is. I have my own really conflicted decisions about changing the way I eat and yet my brain understands that it's what we all have to do. Or it's what I have to do at least.
What being 'daytime vegan' means Q: But vegan? I don't know if I could give up cheese...
A: Well, the thing is it's daytime vegan (laughs)
Q: So, only when the sun is up?
A: Totally. Basically, statistically, if you give up animal products for two of your meals, you end up using less carbon than if you're a full-time vegetarian. I think if I fully had to give up cheese and dairy and butter it would just be like, I couldn't. I would die.
One of the books I've been reading is by my friend Jonathan Safran Foer. He has a new climate change book coming out, and he proposes this and his whole book is about his own personal difficulty with it and also the understanding that if you don't do it, you're just a person who didn't do something when the moment required it.
Q: I know you're working on another book. Can you share anything about what people can expect in "What to Cook"?
A: Yeah! I mean to be completely honest I have not actually started working on it because I am going to make another TV series first. I'm in the sort of development part, which is like the brainstorm part of the show, so that's been taking up most of my mental energy.
How her new book will be different from 'Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat' But as far as the book, one of things I've seen is that people feel kind of stuck about deciding what to make.
Even really good home cooks create a menu for a dinner or a party page for page, word for word out of a magazine spread of recipes. Or because they saw such-and-such-thing on TV or Instagram. I started to think about how there's so much I can share with those people about how to make their lives easier by understanding what decisions to make about what they should be cooking.
I did my best with "Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat" to teach people how to translate how professional cooks think about how to cook. What I've realized is I haven't really that similar translation about how professional cooks decide what to cook.
I think people have a really romantic notion that chefs show up at work and are like 'today I feel like making this grand and wonderful creation' or something. And maybe some people do that. But the constraints of a real kitchen are what chiefly make a professional cook decide what to make. If I can teach that to home cooks I think it would make people's day-to-day cooking a lot easier.
So that's what I'm going to do with the book that I have not started writing yet. (laughs)

Texto completo: Samin Nosrat's laugh is delightful and infectious. It's the kind of warm uninhibited chorus that makes you feel not only like you've known the New York Times best-selling author for years, but also that she couldn't be more happy to talk with you today. This charming, approachable persona is an undeniable part of the reason why Nostrat's Netflix series "Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat" — inspired by her James Beard Award-winning book of the same name — has been hailed for changing the food show landscape forever. In the four-part series, viewers see Nosrat lose herself in the pleasure of a piece of aged Parmesan cheese, giggle as her eyes water while chopping onions and do an adorable happy dance with a friend as they devour a dish while standing around the kitchen counter. It's a show that's as much about food, where it comes from and how to make it, as it is about watching someone simply enjoy it. The show premiered on the streaming platform almost a year ago, and Nosrat's been busy in the intervening months. She's already begun work on a second series and thinking about her next book, "What to Cook." She's also hitting the road, crisscrossing the country for evening events during which she chats with local hosts about food, cooking and anything else that might come up when she fields questions from the audience. We chatted with the author, TV star and chef about what fans can expect.
Question: So, what can people expect from this tour?
Answer: We basically laugh a lot (laughs) and then, I mean, each conversation is different, which is something I really love about it.
One thing I'm really excited about that is that I edited this year's edition of "Best American Food Writing." I was pretty riled up when I was doing the editing and writing the forward but what I'm excited about is I think it will rile people up when they read it. I did my best to highlight all sorts of different issues beyond what we just consider to be food and I'm really excited to get to talk about the wonderful diversity of the writing.
The other thing I'm thinking so much about is climate change and how food affects and is affected by it.
I have been reading a lot about climate change and agriculture and food and I feel like — and I'm so hesitant to say this, but I gotta start saying it somewhere — I feel like the only responsible thing for me to do is become a daytime vegan. And I really don't want to. Like I really don't want to but I feel like it's something I have to do and I feel like it's what I need to, not necessarily bully other people into doing, but at least model for people. Changing out diets is the single most powerful thing we as individuals can do.
It's both depressing and exciting. (laughs)
Why getting a show was a 'whiplash moment' Q: It sounds like you maybe have been thinking about using your platform to be an activist? Or raise awareness, maybe?
A: I wouldn't use the word "activist." I still do have a relationship with the New York Times so I have not fully jumped into activism. But I do think education and awareness is really important and it's my job.
I found out that Netflix was interested in the show two days after the 2016 election and it was a really hard time for me. I really felt that that election said to me, personally, that people who look like you are not wanted here. So I was sort of sitting with the grief of that and then found out this thing two days later.
It was a really whiplash moment for me and I took it really seriously and thought really carefully about whether I wanted to put myself in the public eye when the public had made it clear that people who look like me or are from the part of the world that my family is from are not necessarily considered American or welcome here.
I did in the end decide that I did want to do it and I was like, OK if I am going to do this then I'm going to use it to promote the kind of message that's really important to me, which is one of unity and sharing with people my ultimate belief that we are more similar than different across the world.
So I don't know that I would use the word "activist" necessarily, but I do think that there are so many things in our daily lives that feel really overwhelming. Changing a habit is really hard. I get how hard it is. I have my own really conflicted decisions about changing the way I eat and yet my brain understands that it's what we all have to do. Or it's what I have to do at least.
What being 'daytime vegan' means Q: But vegan? I don't know if I could give up cheese...
A: Well, the thing is it's daytime vegan (laughs)
Q: So, only when the sun is up?
A: Totally. Basically, statistically, if you give up animal products for two of your meals, you end up using less carbon than if you're a full-time vegetarian. I think if I fully had to give up cheese and dairy and butter it would just be like, I couldn't. I would die.
One of the books I've been reading is by my friend Jonathan Safran Foer. He has a new climate change book coming out, and he proposes this and his whole book is about his own personal difficulty with it and also the understanding that if you don't do it, you're just a person who didn't do something when the moment required it.
Q: I know you're working on another book. Can you share anything about what people can expect in "What to Cook"?
A: Yeah! I mean to be completely honest I have not actually started working on it because I am going to make another TV series first. I'm in the sort of development part, which is like the brainstorm part of the show, so that's been taking up most of my mental energy.

Post Malone in Week 3 Atop Billboard Chart

Texto completo: The album -- a streaming juggernaut -- is the first of the year with a three-week streak.
For the first time this year, an album has spent three consecutive weeks atop the Billboard 200 chart.
As expected, Post Malone's "Hollywood's Bleeding" (Republic) is a streaming juggernaut -- with totals of 365 million, 221 million and now 172 million streams in its three weeks out -- and despite a 25 percent dip in overall activity from its second week numbers, it remains No. 1.
The album by Malone -- "a rock singer whose cadences come from hip-hop, a pop songwriter who marries brightness with sleaze," as The New York Times pop music critic Jon Caramanica wrote -- added another 16,000 in album sales to its streams for a total of 149,000 units, according to Nielsen, which combines digital downloads, streams and sales into one figure.
For the second straight week, Malone's album topped those by artists whose commercial strength lies not in streaming but in the more throwback formats (CDs, vinyl) still preferred by many country and rock fans.
"The Owl" by Zac Brown Band had just 6 million total streams compared to Malone's 172 million, but earned 99,000 in sales for a total of 106,000 units -- good enough for No. 2. At No. 3, Blink-182's "Nine" was streamed 21 million times and had 77,000 in sales for a total of 94,000. Both groups found success using a bundle strategy that gave away copies of the album along with tickets to their recent tours.
The rest of the Top 5 includes two former chart-toppers from August: Taylor Swift's "Lover," in its fifth week out, dropped one spot to No. 4 with 57 million streams and 19,000 in sales, while Young Thug's "So Much Fun" fell to No. 5 from No. 4 with 61 million streams and just 515 units sold as a full album.

Finnish leader in front seat for Trump's media roller-coaster ride

Texto completo: The rowdy, meandering and combative news conference Wednesday began with President Trump marveling at the media.
"Look at all the press that you attract," he told Finnish President Sauli Niinisto as the two men faced a room of reporters. "Do you believe this? Very impressive."
It ended with Trump excoriating the press as "corrupt people" who undermine U.S. democracy.
"If the press were straight and honest and forthright and tough we would be a far greater nation," he said.
For the 40 minutes in between, the East Room of the White House played host to a roller coaster display of the grievances, victimhood, falsehoods and braggadocio that have come to define Trump's presidency - a combustible mix that has only become more potent as the president faces the growing threat of impeachment.
Trump bared his frustrations in a heated exchange with a journalist who asked him about a July 25 phone call in which Trump pushed the Ukrainian government to investigate one of his potential Democratic challengers, former vice president Joe Biden.
"Are you talking to me?" Trump said, glaring at Jeff Mason of Reuters.
When Mason pressed ahead to ask what the president wanted the Ukrainians to do - a central question in the impeachment inquiry - Trump cut him off and told him to direct a question to Niinisto.
"Did you hear me? Did you hear me?" Trump said, raising his voice and telling Mason not to be "rude." "I have answered everything. It's a whole hoax and you know who's playing into the hoax? People like you and the fake news media that we have in this country."
It was the coda to a foreign leader visit that began and ended with Trump's complaints on full display, starting with a sour venting session earlier in the day in the Oval Office.
As the targets of Trump's anger grow in number, Trump's public outbursts have also become more vitriolic.
The president described the whistleblower whose complaint alleges presidential abuse of power as "fake" and "vicious" and into "some bad things." He accused the White House official who alerted the whistleblower about Trump's call of being a "spy." He said House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), who is running the Democrats' impeachment inquiry, was guilty of "treason."
He blasted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) - who earlier Wednesday urged her caucus to be somber and prayerful during the impeachment process - saying she "hands out subpoenas like they're cookies."
The afternoon news conference began with a sense of normalcy that defied the sense of chaos enveloping Washington as Democrats ramp up their impeachment inquiry with document requests, subpoenas and congressional hearings.
Trump, playing the role of statesman during his scripted opening remarks, offered condolences to Finland for a recent stabbing attack. He pledged to increase trade with the U.S. ally and encouraged Finnish companies to invest in the United States.
"We want Finnish companies to join in America's extraordinary economic revival," he said. "So many countries are coming in. It's the hot place. We have the hottest economy in the world and it's the hot place to be."
But as the event turned to the unscripted question-and-answer session, Trump's other personas emerged. He presented himself as a victim, a survivor, a "stable genius," a ruthless counterpuncher and the most productive president in history.
Niinisto looked on, his face betraying his surprise and bewilderment at the dramatic arc of the Trump show. As Trump held court, the Finnish leader hardly got a word in. At one point, when Trump boasted of his wins before the World Trade Organization, Niinisto interjected: "I think the question is for me."
Trump grew most animated as he listed his grievances and described all the forces he believed are arrayed against him and his presidency.
He repeated words like "hoax" "scam" and "fraud" as casually as another president might say NATO or "shared values."
"So the political storm, I've lived with it from the day I got elected," he said. "I'm used to it. For me, it's like putting on a suit in the morning."
He complained that after special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's extensive probe into Russian election meddling and potential obstruction of justice by the White House, he got only "three days of peace" before the threat of impeachment cast a cloud over the second half of his term.
"I've lived with this cloud now for almost three years," he said.
The president lamented that former House speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) "would never give anybody a subpoena," hesitating when Trump's defenders wanted to use congressional powers to investigate Democrats and the FBI. By contrast, he said, Pelosi was a subpoena-approving machine.
Trump also embraced a sense of victimhood-by-proxy for his aides, some of whom were implicated in Mueller's probe.
"They came down to Washington to do a great job," he said of his aides, claiming that the investigations had "destroyed" them. "They left Washington dark."
But Trump also presented himself as the battle-scarred victor who was uniquely capable of fighting back against his perceived enemies and on behalf of his supporters.
In describing how he has survived the "greatest hoax" in history and a "fraudulent crime on the American people," he cited conservative media figures.
"People have said to me, how does he handle it?" Trump said. "Rush Limbaugh said, 'I don't know of any man in America that could handle it.' Sean Hannity said the same thing."
He suggested he was considering "bringing a major lawsuit" to respond to Mueller's investigation, a suit that presumably would pit the head of the executive branch against his own Justice Department.
When a reporter asked Trump about a New York Times report that revealed contact between the whistleblower and Democratic staff on the House Intelligence Committee, Trump zeroed in on Schiff and accused him of orchestrating the entire episode.
"It shows that Schiff is a fraud and I love that question," Trump said after taking a printed copy of the story from his suit jacket. "That's big stuff; that's a big story."
Niinisto, who spoke for just a few minutes during the 40-minute news conference and 17-minute Oval Office meeting, talked about the greatness of U.S. democracy and encouraged Trump to "keep it going." He also offered a mild rebuke of Trump's constant berating of the European Union, which the president has said was formed to take advantage of the United States.
"I wanted to take up with the president the importance of trans-Atlantic cooperation," he said. "We all know Europe needs U.S.A., but I say that U.S.A. needs also Europe. We know the price of everything. We should recognize also the value of everything."
Trump did not seem to mind or notice the light criticism, and he spent much of the news conference boasting about various aspects of his presidency, which he said was the most productive in U.S. history. He credited himself for cutting taxes and regulations, celebrated the "booming" economy - even as the stock market fell nearly 500 points Wednesday - and celebrated veterans health-care legislation he signed.
He saved some of his most effusive praise for the controversial phone call he had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, a conversation that has become a central component of the Democrats' impeachment process.
At various points he described the call as "beautiful," "perfect," "great" and "100 percent."
"Not a thing wrong with it," he said of the call. "Believe it or not, I watch my words very carefully. There are those that think I'm a very stable genius, okay?"
When Mason asked Niinisto about a recent World Trade Organization case in which the United States prevailed, Trump jumped in and claimed that his presence was what helped tip the judgment in his government's favor.
"You never had wins with other presidents, did you?" Trump said. "But we are having a lot of wins with WTO since I became president."
In fact, the case started long before Trump became president, and previous presidents also have presided over successful WTO cases.
But such minor details didn't stop Trump from engaging in his unique form of bragging.
"Because I know that I'm right and because I'm doing a great job for the American people," he said. "I'm very, very happy living the way I'm living."

Veteran New York Times columnist asks: ‘Will Trump Ever Leave the White House?’

Texto completo: Veteran New York Times columnist Thomas B. Edsall questioned the likelihood that President Trump would be willing to leave the White House should impeachment proceedings lead to his removal or if he loses his bid for reelection in 2020.
"Since 2015, we have been worrying about how much danger Donald Trump posed to democracy," Edsall begins ominously. "Now, with the impeachment inquiry moving forward, a new question is rapidly gaining relevance: How and when will President Trump leave the White House?"
Edsall, 78, writes a weekly opinion column for the New York Times and previously reported on national politics for the Washington Post for 25 years. The recipient of many awards in journalism Edsall has also authored several books on political analysis including Building Red America: The New Conservative Coalition and the Drive For Permanent Power in 2006.
A frequent critic of Trump and his supporters, Edsall has penned several incendiary columns about the current administration including, "The Trump Voters Whose ‘Need for Chaos’ Obliterates Everything Else" and "Trump Needs His Base to Burn With Anger."
In the most recent column, titled, "Will Trump Ever Leave the White House?" Edsall stirs panic about Trump's support for advocates rights established in the Second Amendment. In the column, Edsall extensively quoted David Leege, a professor emeritus of political science at Notre Dame University. "We should not assume that either a 2020 election defeat or impeachment/conviction will remove Trump from the White House," Leege said to Edsall. "Both before Trump was elected in 2016 and during his term, he has made frequent references to 'my 2nd Amendment friends' and increasingly the 'patriots' who constitute the military."
"The country is armed to the hilt,” Leege also quoted as saying in the column. "As president, Trump has resisted any effort to curb citizen access to guns and ammo. He puts on a modest show of concern when a particularly bad gun massacre occurs but, in the end, he sees armed citizens as a significant personal asset." He went on to suggest that Trump could have the support of the military should he choose to pursue a coup and this could "embroil us in a major war."
Edsall goes on to quote Trump — both before and after his election in 2016 — in instances where he perceived the president to be interested in extra-legal pursuits in order to maintain his position. "All of this raises a couple of questions," Edsall says. "What drives the depth and intensity of support for Trump? And how far are those supporters willing to go to keep him in the White House?"
Edsall then goes on to suggest that the president's supporters might back a coup or other counter-Constitutional efforts in the interest of protecting their cultural identity. "Extensive evidence suggests that the passion of Trump’s loyalists is, to a considerable extent, rooted in what they perceive as racial and cultural threat."
Continuing with information from several sources and studies, Edsall explores the depths at which issues of race bear on the voting choice of both conservatives and liberals going into the 2020 election. His conclusion: "From the perspective of Trump’s most ardent supporters, the issue of race is crucial."

Texto completo: I was based in Washington and reported from Capitol Hill during Bill Clinton’s impeachment, which was the last time the country entered waters like these. It was ugly, and Democrats and Republicans traded vicious words.
But Clinton never publicly accused his detractors of treason or floated the idea that one of them be arrested on those grounds, as Donald Trump just did with Adam Schiff.
Clinton and his defenders raised the specter of a “vast right-wing conspiracy,” to use Hillary Clinton’s infamous phrase, thus asserting that he was being persecuted for his politics, not punished for his misdeeds.
But they didn’t insist, as Trump and his defenders routinely do, that a vital part of the federal government was an evil cabal intent on undermining our democratic processes, which is Trump’s self-serving characterization of the intelligence community. Their central strategy wasn’t to ignite a full-blown crisis of confidence in the institutions of government. They weren’t serving dire notice, as Trump essentially is, that if the president goes down, he’s taking everyone and everything else with him.
The Clintons possessed and projected a moral arrogance that was laughably oxymoronic under the circumstances. And they and other prominent Democrats junked the party’s supposed concern for women’s empowerment to savage Monica Lewinsky, Paula Jones and others who came forward with claims about the president’s extramarital sexual activity, including serious accusations of sexual violence.
But they didn’t equate the potential fall of the president with the fall of the Republic. They didn’t go full apocalypse. Bill Clinton didn’t prophesy that his impeachment would lead to a kind of “civil war” from which the country would “never heal,” as Trump did by tweeting an evangelical pastor’s comments on Fox News along those lines.
I wrote last week that the prospect of Trump’s impeachment terrified me, and one of the main reasons I cited was what we’re seeing now: his histrionic response, which is untethered from any sense of honor, civic concern or real patriotism.
He’s not like most of his predecessors in the White House, who had some limits, at least a few scruples and the capacity to feel shame. Their self-pity wasn’t this unfathomably deep, their delusions of martyrdom this insanely grand. “There has been no President in the history of our Country who has been treated so badly as I have,” he tweeted last week, and the violins have wailed only louder and weepier since.
While there were fellow narcissists among his forebears, was there a single nihilist like Trump? I doubt it, and so the current waters are in fact uncharted, because the ship of state has a sort of madman at its helm.
That he’s fighting back by impugning his critics’ motives, stonewalling investigators and carping about the media shouldn’t disturb anyone, not if we’re being grown-ups. Richard Nixon, confronted with his impeachment, thrashed and seethed. Clinton assembled a war room in an effort to outwit his adversaries. That’s the nature of politics. That’s the right of the accused.
But in the mere week since a formal impeachment inquiry was announced, Trump has already gone much farther than that and behaved in ways that explode precedent, offend decency and boggle the mind. We’re fools if we don’t brace for more and worse.
For grotesque example, he has suggested — repeatedly — that government officials who tattled about his crooked conversation with the Ukrainian president are spies who deserve to be executed. Had any other president done that, many Americans would speak of nothing else for the next month .
But from Trump, such a horror wasn’t even surprising, and it competed for attention with so many other outrages that it was dulled, the way so much of his unconscionable behavior is. When you churn out a disgrace a minute and no one expects anything nobler, you’re inoculated by your own awfulness.
He has taken his vilification of the media to new depths, content on this front, as on others, to pump Americans full of a toxic cynicism so long as he profits from it. He and his handmaidens have disseminated distortion after distortion, lie upon lie, including the claim that deep-state officials tweaked the criteria for whistleblowers just so that someone could ensnare him.
They have instructed Americans not to believe their own eyes, their own ears, their own intelligence. They mean to put truth itself up for grabs, no matter the fallout.
Lindsey Graham, the sycophant of the century, called the whistleblower’s complaint a setup, as if it didn’t rest on the sturdy foundation of a reconstructed transcript — released by the White House — that shows Trump imploring a foreign leader to do political dirty work for him.
Trump keeps saying it was a “perfect” call, which is like seeing Dom Pérignon in a puddle of sewage. Then again, his presidency has long depended on such optical illusions.
There’s light, though, and it’s this: As corrosive as his as tirades are, they may also be what does him in. He’s poised to take this persecution complex too far.
Already, there has been a swell of support for impeachment, according to new polls released by CNN and Monmouth University, and I bet that trend continues as revelations of his wrongdoing cascade and as he wildly overreacts.
That probably wouldn’t be enough to get Republican senators to convict him and remove him from office, should the House follow through with impeachment and a Senate trial ensue. But it would affect November 2020.
He’s in a bind, because his burn-down-the-house defense against impeachment makes the best case that he must be impeached — that a leader with no bounds and no bottom can’t be allowed to rage on unimpeded. The impeachment inquiry is laying Trump bare. As scary as that is for us, it may be even scarier for him.

Jamelle Bouie: Andrew Johnson’s violent language — and Trump’s

Texto completo: Over the weekend, in a rage over impeachment, President Donald Trump accused Rep. Adam Schiff of “treason,” promised “Big Consequences” for the whistleblower who sounded the alarm about his phone call with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy of Ukraine and shared a warning — from a Baptist pastor in Dallas — that impeachment “will cause a Civil War like fracture in this Nation from which our Country will never heal.”
We’re already on to the next news cycle, but we shouldn’t lose sight of what happened with those tweets. The president was using the power and influence of his office to intimidate a witness and threaten a member of Congress with prosecution (of a crime still punishable by death), before raising the specter of large-scale political violence should lawmakers hold him responsible for his actions. If he had said this anywhere besides Twitter — in the Rose Garden or at a campaign stop — we would see it as a clear and unacceptable abuse of presidential rhetoric, his authoritarian instincts at work.
The House impeachment inquiry will almost certainly focus on Trump’s attempt to solicit foreign intervention in the 2020 election. If it goes beyond that, it might also include the president’s corruption and self-dealing. But in whichever direction the investigation goes, the House should consider Trump’s violent rhetoric as a separate offense, worthy of its own article of impeachment.
There’s precedent for making transgressive presidential speech a “high crime or misdemeanor.” The 10th article of impeachment against Andrew Johnson in 1868 was about his language and conduct over the course of his term. Two years earlier, Johnson had taken a tour of Northern cities to campaign against Radical Republicans in Congress and build support for his lenient policies toward the defeated South.
At first, it was a success, with large crowds cheering the president during events in Baltimore, New York and Philadelphia. But his fortunes turned in Cleveland, where the stubborn and taciturn Johnson unraveled in the face of hecklers. “The president was frequently interrupted by cheers, by hisses and by cries, apparently from those opposed to him in the crowd,” William Hudson, a reporter for The Cleveland Leader, wrote. When a heckler yelled, “Hang Jeff Davis!” — referring to the former leader of the Confederacy, then held at Fort Monroe in Virginia — Johnson replied, “Why don’t you hang him?” When another shouted, “Thad Stevens” — the chief Radical Republican in the House of Representatives — a now angry Johnson responded with “Why don’t you hang Thad Stevens and Wendell Phillips?” Phillips had been a leading abolitionist.
Johnson continued to speak, struggling to gain the upper hand with the crowd. By the end, however, the president was unhinged. “Come out where I can see you,” he said to one heckler. “If you ever shoot a man, you will do it in the dark and pull the trigger when no one else is by to see.” After witnessing this disastrous performance, an aide urged the president to consider the dignity of the office. Johnson was dismissive. “I don’t care about my dignity,” he reportedly said.
The tour didn’t improve. In St. Louis, as in Cleveland, hecklers yelled “New Orleans” in reference to a massacre that summer in which white Democrats, most of them ex-Confederates, attacked a large gathering of black Republican marchers, killing nearly 50 people. In response, Johnson said the “riot at New Orleans was substantially planned.” But he blamed Radical Republicans who, he said, encouraged the city’s “black population to arm themselves and prepare for the shedding of blood.” At this point, someone in the crowd called him a “traitor,” which — as Garry Boulard recounts in “The Swing Around the Circle: Andrew Johnson and the Train Ride That Destroyed a Presidency” — Johnson angrily denounced with one of the strangest tirades of the tour: “I have been traduced! I have been slandered. I have been maligned. I have been called Judas — Judas Iscariot and all of that.”
By the time it was over, Johnson had been humiliated and his reputation was in tatters. In The Atlantic Monthly, essayist Edwin Percy Whipple summarized elite opinion of Johnson’s tour.
Never before did the first office in the gift of the people appear so poor an object of human ambition as when Andrew Johnson made it an eminence on which to exhibit inability to behave and incapacity to reason. His low cunning conspired with his devouring egoism to make him throw off all the restraints of official decorum, in the expectation that he would find duplicates of himself in the crowds he addressed and that mob diffused would heartily sympathize with Mob impersonated. Never was a blustering demagogue led by a distempered sense of self-importance into a more fatal error.
All of this would resurface in 1868, when the House adopted its 11 articles of impeachment against the president. Among them was a reference to his summer swing through the North — to the idea that Johnson had sullied the office of the presidency with dangerous, demagogic rhetoric. In its 10th article of impeachment, the House of Representatives accused Johnson of being “unmindful of the high duties of his office and the dignity and proprieties thereof.” His behavior, they argued, was an “attempt to bring into disgrace, ridicule, hatred, contempt and reproach the Congress of the United States” and to “impair and destroy the regard and respect of all the good people of the United States for the Congress and the legislative power thereof.”
Article 10 was divisive. Not necessarily because the Congress or its Republican majority had any love for Johnson, but because it raised difficult political and constitutional questions. How could anyone actually prove that Johnson meant to “impair and destroy” the regard of Congress? And while it’s true the president has unique duties, it’s also true that the president is entitled to the same freedom of speech that any other citizen has. His rhetoric was offensive, but was it impeachable?
Johnson’s opponents in the Senate opted not to test the case. They tried the president on just three articles of impeachment. And if not for the last-minute (and arguably self-interested) defection of Sen. Edmund Ross of Kansas, Johnson would have been cast from office, the first president to be impeached and removed.
This is all to say that Trump easily meets the Andrew Johnson standard for impeachable rhetoric. For nearly three years, he has used the presidency to stir anger and incite hatred. He has rallied crowds with racist demagogy and threatened opponents with violence from his supporters. “I can tell you I have the support of the police, the support of the military, the support of the Bikers for Trump — I have the tough people,” Trump said in an interview with Breitbart this summer. “But they don’t play it tough — until they go to a certain point, and then it would be very bad, very bad.” On Tuesday, he accused his Democratic opponents of orchestrating a coup.
If impeachment is about a pattern of behavior — if it’s about the sum total of a transgressive, unethical and unlawful presidency — then this rhetoric must be part of the final account. And it is a difficult case; we don’t want to criminalize speech. But presidential rhetoric isn’t just speech — it is a form of power, and like most of his other powers, Trump has been abusing it.

Texto completo: El presidente Donald Trump rechazó de que quería armar su muro fronterizo con México con características como picos, una corriente eléctrica y un foso son cocodrilos, además de sugerir disparar a los inmigrantes en los pies para evitar que cruzaran a los Estados Unidos.
“Ahora la prensa está tratando de vender el hecho de que quería un foso relleno de caimanes y serpientes, con una cerca electrificada y puntas afiladas en la parte superior, en nuestra frontera sur” , escribió Trump. “Puedo ser duro con la seguridad fronteriza, pero no tan duro. La prensa se ha vuelto loca. ¡Noticias falsas!”
Now the press is trying to sell the fact that I wanted a Moat stuffed with alligators and snakes, with an electrified fence and sharp spikes on top, at our Southern Border. I may be tough on Border Security, but not that tough. The press has gone Crazy. Fake News!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 2, 2019
Así reaccionó el mandatario sobre un extracto de un libro de los reporteros de The New York Times, Michael Shear y Julie Hirschfeld Davis , declarando detalles en los informes que incluye disparar en los pies a los inmigrantes .
Los reporteros informaron que Trump “a menudo” sugirió rodear su muro fronterizo con una trinchera como un foso e incluso les pidió a los ayudantes que buscaran estimaciones de costos para el plan presentado supuestamente men marzo en el Despacho Oval.
Entre sus otras ideas estaba su amenaza, que emitió públicamente, de cerrar la frontera entre México y Estados Unidos por completo, sus sugerencias privadas de que los agentes de la Patrulla Fronteriza comenzaran a disparar a los inmigrantes y su idea de que los listones de acero electrificado que componen el muro fronterizo.
“¡Me estás haciendo parecer un idiota!” , habría expresado molesto el mandatario en la tensa reunión de marzo con la entonces secretario de Seguridad Nacional Kirstjen Nielsen y el secretario de Estado Mike Pompeo .

Michelle Goldberg: Trump’s claims about Biden aren’t ‘unsupported.’ They’re lies.

Texto completo: On Sept. 24, 2015, Geoffrey Pyatt, then the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, spoke in Odessa about the scourge of corruption. It was about a year and a half after what is sometimes called the Revolution of Dignity, when Ukrainians overthrew the kleptocratic, Russian-aligned regime of Viktor Yanukovych. The country was trying to move in a more liberal, European direction. Corruption, said Pyatt, threatened to hold the new Ukraine back.
Pyatt called out the office of Viktor Shokin, then the prosecutor general of Ukraine. “Corrupt actors within the prosecutor general’s office are making things worse by openly and aggressively undermining reform,” he said. Pyatt specifically lambasted Shokin’s office for subverting a British case against a man named Mykola Zlochevsky, Yanukovych’s former ecology minister.
In 2014, as part of a money-laundering investigation, British authorities froze $23 million Zlochevsky had in London. They requested supporting documentation from Shokin’s office. Instead, it intervened on Zlochevsky’s behalf. “As a result, the money was freed by the U.K. court and shortly thereafter the money was moved to Cyprus,” said Pyatt.
“Shokin was seen as a single point of failure clogging up the system and blocking corruption cases,” a former official in Barack Obama’s administration told me. Vice President Joe Biden eventually took the lead in calling for Shokin’s ouster.
As all this was happening, Biden’s son, Hunter, sat on the board of Burisma Holdings, a natural gas company that Zlochevsky co-founded, at some points earning $50,000 a month. Zlochevsky might have thought he could ingratiate himself with the Obama administration by buying an association with the vice president. All available evidence suggests he was wrong.
Turning this history on its head, President Donald Trump has accused Joe Biden of coercing Ukraine to jettison Shokin in order to protect Hunter. He has pressured Ukraine’s current president to open an investigation into the Bidens, which would make Trump’s charges seem more credible. As the president faces impeachment, his surrogates are parroting his attack on Biden, and his campaign is reportedly spending a staggering $10 million on an ad to amplify the smear.
Journalists, perhaps seeking to appear balanced, have sometimes described Trump’s claims about Biden as “unsubstantiated” or “unsupported.” That is misleading, because it suggests more muddiness in the factual record than actually exists. Trump isn’t making unproven charges against Biden. He is blatantly lying about him. He and his defenders are spreading a conspiracy theory that is the precise opposite of the truth.
Like most effective conspiracy theories, this one is built around a speck of something real. Hunter Biden’s place on Burisma’s board was untoward, even if it’s preposterous for Trump to complain about nepotistic corruption. Biden’s son doesn’t seem to have broken any laws, but the way he traded on his name was still sleazy.
Joe Biden appears to have been uncomfortable with his son’s involvement with Burisma; in a New Yorker profile, Hunter recalled his father saying, “I hope you know what you are doing.” Hunter said they never spoke further about the issue; Biden has made a point of not talking to his son about his business dealings.
It’s not hard to imagine why Biden didn’t press Hunter. The Biden boys and their father had been through hell together. Hunter has said his first memory was waking up in the hospital next to his older brother, Beau, after the car crash that killed their mother and baby sister. He grew up to be a troubled man, his life pockmarked by addiction and failure.
Beau died of brain cancer a few months before Biden traveled to Ukraine to push the government to crack down on corruption. It’s not shocking that, at a moment when his family was consumed by grief, Biden wasn’t inclined to confront his surviving son.
But even if you’re not inclined to empathize with Biden — even if you assume the worst about him — Trump’s conspiracy theory makes no sense. To believe it, you’d have to first believe that the foreign affairs apparatus of the Obama administration was willing to put its credibility on the line in service of the black sheep of the Biden family. After all, Joe Biden wasn’t freelancing in Ukraine; he was carrying out White House policy.
Further, if the Trump administration truly believes that Obama’s Ukraine policy was crooked, one might ask why it has Pyatt, who helped accomplish that policy, representing America as ambassador to Greece.
Most important, getting rid of Shokin made an investigation of Burisma more likely, not less. “He didn’t want to investigate Burisma,” the Ukrainian anti-corruption activist Daria Kaleniuk told The Washington Post. “Shokin was fired not because he wanted to do that investigation, but quite to the contrary, because he failed that investigation.”
However bad the optics around Hunter Biden, Joe Biden was not serving his son’s interests. If anything, they were working at cross-purposes.
As I’ve written multiple times, I don’t want Biden to be the Democratic nominee. There’s much in his legislative record that troubles me, and I don’t think he’s as electable as his champions claim. In some ways, my preferred political outcome would be advanced if Trump’s Ukraine scandal ends up tarring Biden as well.
But Trump’s weaponized disinformation is corrosive to democracy no matter whom it targets. Like many authoritarians, he depends on getting people to accept a big lie or to give up on the idea of truth altogether. If he succeeds in defaming Biden today, he’ll be even more audacious in using the same strategy against anyone else who threatens him. What’s at stake isn’t just Biden’s political future. It’s how much Trump can erode the political salience of reality, and how much the media helps him.

Texto completo: El presidente Donald Trump habría sugerido medidas ilegales para detener la llegada de inmigrantes a Estados Unidos el pasado marzo.
Un informe del New York Times revela las discusiones que tuvo Trump con varios de sus asesores por los días en que la caravana de migrantes se instalaba en la frontera con el objetivo de pedir asilo político.
El reporte describe a un Trump desesperado y agresivo con sus asesores, entre ellos su yerno Jared Kuschner.
“¡Me están haciendo ver como un idiota!” , habría gritado Trump en una reunión. “Hice campaña con este tema. Es mi asunto”.
El presidente llegó a sugerir un cierre total de la frontera pero sus asesores le advirtieron que la medida dejaría a atrapados a turistas estadounidense en México y crearía un caos económico. La entonces secretaria de Seguridad Nacional Kirstjen Nielsen añadió que las solicitudes de asilo podían seguir en marcha en un eventual cierre de los pasos fronterizos.
El presidente rechazó las advertencias y sugirió medidas más extremas como disparar a los inmigrantes si tiraban piedras, algo que se conoció públicamente en ese momento. Los asesores le dijeron que eso era ilegal. Trump después pidió balear en las piernas a los inmigrantes para retrasar su arribo a la frontera.
El artículo menciona el momento en el que Trump decide atacar a México con aranceles . También tiene detalles del despido de Nielsen, quien le recordó al presidente que no podía construir un muro de concreto ya que todo estaba contratado con las barrerar de acero.
Trump terminaría resignado a su suerte y en los meses siguientes se dedicó a criticar las leyes de inmigración de Estados Unidos.

Texto completo: Maryland Congressman Andy Harris added his take to the commotion surrounding a whistleblower complaint that led to an official impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump.
"We should air everything out," said Harris, R-MD-01, who represents the Eastern Shore of Maryland in Congress and serves as co-chair of the Congressional Ukrainian Caucus, in an interview with NPR published Monday. "I fully believe everything should be aired out and the American people will figure it out ... We don't have all the information yet."
In the July 25 call, Trump pressed Ukraine's leader, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to work with U.S. Attorney General William Barr as well as his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani to investigate corruption accusations, repeated without evidence, against potential 2020 Democratic rival Joe Biden.
The complaint, contained in a letter to the chairmen of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, suggested that Trump's efforts "constitute a serious and flagrant problem," as reported by USA TODAY.
Justice Department prosecutors reviewed a rough transcript of the call in August, the record kept by the White House, and determined that no crime was committed — as the information discussed didn't amount to a "thing of value" that could be quantified, which is what the campaign finance laws require.
The identity of the whistleblower has been confirmed as a CIA officer, a position apolitical in nature, The New York Times first reported.
The whistleblower also described White House efforts to "lock down" information about the Zelenskiy call. "This set of actions underscored to me that White House officials understood the gravity of what had transpired in the call," he said.
The complaint said officials told the whistleblower they were "directed" by White House lawyers to remove the electronic transcript from the computer system, placed instead on a "separate electronic system that is otherwise used to store and handle classified information," the whistleblower said.
The White House has acknowledged that the call summary was placed into a highly secure system usually reserved for classified information pertaining to sensitive national security matters.
Also remaining murky is the potential connection to aid approved by Congress blocked by the president days before the call.
Trump confirmed he ordered the freeze of nearly $400 million of U.S. military and security aid to Ukraine ahead of the call, but he said it was done to encourage European nations to contribute.
Harris encouraged listeners multiple times to read available transcripts for themselves, acknowledging that if there was "quid pro quo" on the president's part in regards to the aid — "that would be wrong."
"I don't see evidence of it now," he said, noting the aid was not discussed explicitly in the rough transcript.
As Harris was further pressed on the Ukrainian aid specifically, given presence on the Ukrainian Caucus, the representative didn't have a straight answer on the hold.
He said he believes the president alluded to it himself as he spoke at he United Nations.
"I think (Trump) was disappointed that our European partners were not playing a bigger role in providing military aid to a country that sits on the edge of their continent, not ours," he said as the interview concluded.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Monday the Senate would have "no choice" but to hold a trial on whether to remove President Donald Trump from office if the House votes to put forward articles of impeachment.
For now, the House has scheduled a series of depositions and one hearing with some of the officials wrapped up in the story.
It would take a simple majority of the House (218 votes) to submit articles of impeachment to the Senate. Impeachment would be akin to an indictment in a court proceeding. A trial would then be held in the Senate where it would take at least two-thirds (or 67 votes) of the chamber to convict Trump and remove him from office, as reported by USA TODAY.
Some lawmakers want the House to decide whether to file articles of impeachment by Thanksgiving, a timeline that could avoid having the issue spill over into the 2020 election year.
But for now, most people are watching the "showdown" unfold — questioning the true nature of the 30-minute phone call as investigations continue.
"Look, we've got to get to the bottom of that," Harris said.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Monday said the GOP-controlled Senate "would have no choice" but to take up impeachment if the House Democrat-led inquiry ultimately leads to President Donald Trump being charged with articles of impeachment.
"I would have no choice but to take it up," McConnell (R-Ky.) told CNBC when asked about the issue during a televised interview. "How long you are on it is a different matter, but I would have no choice but to take it up based on a Senate rule on impeachment."
McConnell's remarks came amid a fast-moving impeachment inquiry launched last week by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) over Trump's request for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate his political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden.
The House Intelligence, Oversight, and Foreign Affairs committees subpoenaed Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, on Monday, and three of Giuliani's business associates, demanding they turn over a trove of documents related to his communications with Ukraine by Oct. 15.
The inquiry moved ahead as Trump continued to rail against House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-California), and defend his July 25 phone call with Zelensky as "perfect." Trump also told reporters in the Oval Office the White House was "trying to find out" the identity of a U.S. intelligence whistleblower who filed a complaint last month against Trump alleging the president abused his office for political gain. The complaint, citing White House officials, describes Trump's call with Zelensky and an effort by the White House to "lock down" access to records of the call over concerns of Trump's request.
The president's communications with foreign leaders faced renewed scrutiny on Monday, following reports in The New York Times and other national outlets, that indicated Trump pressed Australia's prime minister to assist Attorney General Bill Barr in a Justice Department investigation into the origins of the report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.
Senate Republicans have largely dismissed the call for impeachment by Democrats, arguing the inquiry into Trump's call with Zelensky was "premature" and a sign of congressional "overreach." But congressional Democrats have maintained that the president violated his oath of office by asking a foreign government to aid in an investigation that could influence the 2020 presidential election.
McConnell noted that it would take 67 votes in the narrowly divided chamber to change the Senate rules guiding impeachment. Senate Republicans hold a six-seat advantage over Democrats.
Several Democrats on the House Intelligence, Oversight, and Foreign Affairs committees remained in Washington during Congress' two-week recess to continue working on their investigation into the whistleblower's complaint.
Giuliani on Twitter, took aim at the three Democratic chairmen who issued the subpoena, saying they have "prejudged this case." The former New York City mayor said whether he will comply with the subpoena "will be given appropriate consideration."
The trio of committees on Wednesday and Thursday are slated to depose two former high ranking U.S. diplomats who served in Ukraine, and have subpoenaed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo giving him a Friday deadline to turn over documents related to the Trump's communications with Ukraine. 
Marie Yovanovitch, who was tapped to serve as ambassador to Ukraine in 2016 by the Obama administration, and was removed from her post in May 2019 by Trump, is scheduled to meet with the committee on Wednesday.
Kurt Volker, who served as Trump's special envoy to Ukraine, will meet with the panel on Thursday, nearly a week after he abruptly stepped down from his role following the release of an unclassified version of the whistleblower complaint. Volker is mentioned in the whistleblower complaint, which states that he "reportedly provided advice to the Ukrainian leadership about how to 'navigate' the demands that the President had made of" Zelensky.
Trump on Monday continued to take aim at Schiff and the whistleblower, accusing Schiff of "treason" and suggesting he be arrested in a series of tweets.
"The Fake Whistleblower complaint is not holding up," Trump tweeted. "It is mostly about the call to the Ukrainian President which, in the name of transparency, I immediately released to Congress & the public. The Whistleblower knew almost nothing, its 2ND HAND description of the call is a fraud!"
Trump released a memo summarizing the call last week after news reports published days earlier indicated the president ordered the suspension of $400 million in U.S. foreign aid to Ukraine before his / call with Zelensky. In the days leading up to the memo's release, Trump often demurred when asked by reporters if he would release the transcript, saying doing so could possibly influence the candidness of world leaders in future conversations.
The memo of the call indicated that Trump called on Zelensky to open an investigation into the Democratic National Committee's hacked emails and into Biden and his son Hunter Biden, who previously sat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company during his father's time in office.
Ukraine's current prosecutor has said there is no current investigation into the Bidens and no allegations of wr

Warren vs. The Petty Plutocrats

Texto completo: Why do they hate her? It's mainly about their egos.
Remember when pundits used to argue that Elizabeth Warren wasn't likable enough to be president? It was always a lazy take, with a strong element of sexism. And it looks ridiculous now, watching Warren on the campaign trail. Never mind whether she's someone you'd like to have a beer with, she's definitely someone thousands of people want to take selfies with.
But there are some people who really, really dislike Warren: the ultrawealthy, especially on Wall Street. They dislike her so much that some longtime Democratic donors are reportedly considering throwing their backing behind Donald Trump, corruption, collusion and all, if Warren is the Democratic presidential nominee.
And Warren's success is a serious possibility, because Warren's steady rise has made her a real contender, maybe even the front-runner: While she still trails Joe Biden a bit in the polls, betting markets currently give her a roughly 50 percent chance of securing the nomination.
But why does Warren inspire a level of hatred and fear among the very wealthy that I don't think we've seen directed at a presidential candidate since the days of Franklin Delano Roosevelt?
On the surface, the answer may seem obvious. She is proposing policies, notably a tax on fortunes exceeding $ 50 million, that would make the extremely wealthy a bit less so. But delve into the question a bit more deeply, and Warren hatred becomes considerably more puzzling.
For the only people who would be directly affected by her tax proposals are those who more or less literally have more money than they know what to do with. Having a million or two less wouldn't crimp their lifestyles; most of them would barely notice the change.
At the same time, even the very wealthy should be very afraid of the prospect of a Trump re-election. Any doubts you might have had about his authoritarian instincts should have been put to rest by his reaction to the possibility of impeachment: implicit death threats against whistle-blowers, warnings of civil war and claims that members of Congress investigating him are guilty of treason.
And anyone imagining that great wealth would make them safe from an autocrat's wrath should look at the list of Russian oligarchs who crossed Vladimir Putin -- and are now ruined or dead.
So what would make the very wealthy -- even some Jewish billionaires, who should have a very good idea of the likely consequences of right-wing dominance -- support Trump over someone like Warren?
[For an even deeper look at what's on Paul Krugman's mind, sign up for his weekly newsletter.]
There is, I'd argue, an important clue in the "Obama rage" that swept Wall Street circa 2010. Objectively, the Obama administration was very good to the financial industry, even though that industry had just led us into the worst economic crisis since the 1930s. Major financial players were bailed out on lenient terms, and while bankers were subjected to a long-overdue increase in regulation, the new regulations have proved fairly easy for reputable firms to deal with.
Yet financial tycoons were furious with President Barack Obama because they felt disrespected. In truth, Obama's rhetoric was very mild; all he ever did was suggest that some bankers had behaved badly, which no reasonable person could deny. But with great wealth comes great pettiness; Obama's gentle rebukes provoked fury -- and a huge swing in financial industry political contributions toward Republicans.
The point is that many of the superrich aren't satisfied with living like kings, which they will continue to do no matter who wins next year's election. They also expect to be treated like kings, lionized as job creators and heroes of prosperity, and consider any criticism an unforgivable act of lèse-majesté.
And for such people, the prospect of a Warren presidency is a nightmarish threat -- not to their wallets, but to their egos. They can try to brush off someone like Bernie Sanders as a rabble-rouser. But when Warren criticizes malefactors of great wealth and proposes reining in their excesses, her evident policy sophistication -- has any previous candidate managed to turn wonkiness into a form of charisma? -- makes her critique much harder to dismiss.
If Warren is the nominee, then, a significant number of tycoons will indeed go for Trump; better to put democracy at risk than to countenance a challenge to their imperial self-esteem. But will it matter?
Maybe not. These days American presidential elections are so awash in money that both sides can count on having enough resources to saturate the airwaves.
Indeed, over-the-top attacks from the wealthy can sometimes be a political plus. That was certainly the case for F.D.R., who reveled in his plutocratic opposition: "They are unanimous in their hate for me -- and I welcome their hatred."
So far Warren seems to be following the same playbook, tweeting out articles about Wall Street's hostility as if they were endorsements, which in a sense they are. It's good to have the right enemies.
I do worry, however, how Wall Streeters will take it if they go all out to defeat Warren and she wins anyway. Washington can bail out their balance sheets, but who can bail out their damaged psyches?

Texto completo: California is challenging the N.C.A.A.'s business model built on amateur athletes. Here's what that means.
California's governor signed a bill that will allow students playing college sports to strike endorsement deals and hire agents, challenging the National Collegiate Athletic Association on a system that has been in place for decades and generates billions of dollars for universities.
Here are answers to some questions surrounding California's move and its repercussions.
What will the law do?
The law will allow student-athletes throughout California to be compensated for the use of their name, image or likeness, and it will also allow them to hire agents. Unless modified (more on that later), it is scheduled to take effect in 2023.
The law says that universities, athletic conferences and the N.C.A.A. cannot punish students for reaching such deals by stripping them of scholarships or keeping them from playing.
There are some caveats, though. Students won't be allowed to make deals that "conflict with a provision of the athlete's team contract." For example, athletes cannot cut a deal to wear a certain company's gear during a game if their university has an exclusive contract with another company.
How is this different from current N.C.A.A. rules?
The N.C.A.A.'s Division I manual contains a labyrinth of guidelines. But Article 12, which governs amateurism and athletic eligibility, is about to become especially important in California.
Part of that article forbids student-athletes from accepting compensation in exchange for allowing "his or her name or picture to advertise, recommend or promote directly the sale or use of a commercial product or service of any kind."
The bylaws forbid sponsorships, but also activities like taking cash for autographs or monetizing social media channels.
The N.C.A.A. also has a "general rule" (with some exceptions) that players cannot participate in a college sport if they have agreed "to be represented by an agent for the purpose of marketing his or her athletics ability or reputation in that sport."
Both provisions conflict with California's approach.
Will student-athletes be penalized? What about their universities?
They could be.
If neither California nor the N.C.A.A. changes course, student-athletes with agents or endorsement contracts will be in violation of the association's rules. Normally, that would leave them ineligible to play.
In a letter to Gov. Gavin Newsom in September, the N.C.A.A.'s Board of Governors said California schools might gain "an unfair recruiting advantage" because of the law, and they would eventually be barred from N.C.A.A. competition.
Colleges and universities could face substantial fines -- "potentially in the millions of dollars," according to a legislative analysis -- for N.C.A.A. violations, and the financial losses would be even steeper if universities lose eligibility for their teams to compete.
It is not clear, though, whether the N.C.A.A. could legally enforce any fines. California officials have said they do not believe the N.C.A.A. could punish colleges or athletes for complying with a state law.
In a statement on Monday, the N.C.A.A. said it would "consider next steps in California."
Is California crazy?
California is betting that the N.C.A.A. will back down before the law takes effect in January 2023. Given the threats of litigation, fines and competition restrictions, that's a risky proposition, but state officials contend that the N.C.A.A. and its members across the country simply cannot afford to ban or penalize California's colleges and universities.
"This is one of the biggest media markets on planet Earth," Newsom said in an interview with The New York Times. "Media cannot afford not to have California at scale being participatory in the tournaments. They know that, we know that, it's a threat. I don't necessarily take it to heart."
How are people reacting?
Less than two hours after the governor's decision became public, the N.C.A.A. said the law was already "creating confusion for current and future student-athletes, coaches, administrators and campuses, and not just in California." The N.C.A.A., which could bring a lawsuit to challenge the California statute, said its members would continue to weigh changes to their rules.
The Pac-12 Conference, which counts four California universities among its members, warned that the law would "lead to the professionalization of college sports and many unintended consequences related to this professionalism."
But current and former athletes welcomed the law.
LeBron James, the Los Angeles Lakers player who hosted Newsom for the bill signing, said the measure would "change the lives for countless athletes who deserve it!"
The executive director of the National College Players Association, Ramogi Huma, said the law marked "the beginning of the end" of a system that he said made second-class citizens of student-athletes.
"Players everywhere deserve equal rights," Huma, who played football at the University of California, Los Angeles, said in a statement. "The N.C.A.A. will get on board or be plunged into irrelevance. Either way, players win and fans will continue enjoying college sports."
Chip Kelly, the football coach at U.C.L.A., also said Monday that he supported the law and thought it was "the right thing to do."
"It doesn't cost the universities, it doesn't cost the N.C.A.A.," said Kelly, who described the measure as "progress."
Is this happening in other states?
No state has gone as far as California -- so far.
But the N.C.A.A. is facing pressure, in varying amounts, from the public, Congress and a rising number of statehouses. Just in the last few weeks, South Carolina legislators said they intended to introduce a bill like the one in California.
And a state senator from Brooklyn has filed legislation that in some ways mirrors the California measure. But the New York proposal takes another step: It would compel colleges to pay 15 percent of the money earned from sports ticket sales to student-athletes.
What's next?
The time before the law takes effect gives the N.C.A.A. or another party (and plenty might be interested) time to go to court. The N.C.A.A. told the governor in September that it believed the measure to be "unconstitutional," signaling that it could bring a legal challenge connected to the Constitution's commerce clause.
But there is a twist: By the end of October, N.C.A.A. leaders expect to receive a committee's recommendations for changes. The California law explicitly declares that the Legislature intends to "revisit this issue to implement significant findings and recommendations" from that group.
So it is entirely possible for California to amend its law before 2023, perhaps avoiding a legal battle with the N.C.A.A. or some of the state's universities.

Texto completo: President focuses
on whistleblower, polls
indicate a voter shift
Here's a guide to standout moments from another newsy day in the drama engulfing the Trump presidency:

6:08 a.m. Seven days into the impeachment morass, former government officials have begun to speak up without hewing to partisan talking points. On Sunday, the new face was President Trump's former homeland security adviser Thomas Bossert, who went on ABC News to say he was "deeply disturbed" by Trump's call to Ukraine. He also said it was "far from proven" that Trump withheld foreign aid as part of an effort to dig up dirt on former vice president Joe Biden. Today the new voice is former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine John Herbst, a veteran of the George W. Bush administration, who tries to drop some historical context on NPR listeners. "This is highly abnormal," Herbst says of Trump's July call with Ukraine.

6:12 a.m. Herbst also contradicts the Trump argument that Biden did something wrong by pushing to fire Viktor Shokin, a Ukrainian prosecutor who once investigated a company that employed Biden's son. Herbst says Shokin was an untrustworthy "corrupt prosecutor," who the United States, the European Union, the International Monetary Fund and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development all wanted out of the job. Herbst also notes that the Shokin affidavit saying Biden's concerns over his son's company caused his firing was written to aid attorneys for Dmytro Firtash, an oligarch U.S. officials are seeking to extradite on a warrant of bribery. "The folks who are pushing this conspiracy theory are citing this as proof," Herbst says of the affidavit. "And in fact it undermines their position."

8:32 a.m. Kate Bedingfield, Biden's deputy campaign manager, is asked a question that will not go away anytime soon. Does the former vice president have any regrets about not keeping son Hunter Biden from working for the Ukrainian firm while Biden oversaw Ukrainian policy at the White House? "No, because he didn't do anything wrong," Bedingfield says of the younger Biden on CNN's "New Day."

8:46 a.m. Former senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), who quit after undermining his reelection hopes by opposing Trump, calls on other Republican senators "to risk your careers in favor of your principles." In a Washington Post opinion piece, he describes removing Trump from office through impeachment as a tough call, but argues that opposing Trump's reelection is a moral necessity. "Trust me when I say that you can go elsewhere for a job," he writes. "But you cannot go elsewhere for a soul."

9:44 a.m. Attorneys for the whistleblower who launched this process share a letter sent Saturday to the Director of National Intelligence. "The purpose of this letter is to formally notify you of serious concerns we have regarding our client's personal safety," it reads. The concerns were created by Trump. "I want to know . . . who's the person that gave the whistleblower the information, because that's close to a spy," the president said Thursday at an event in New York. "You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? With spies and treason, right? We used to handle them a little differently than we do now."

10:36 a.m. The president's 2016 opponent Hillary Clinton takes a stab at Trump's Twitter crown with a seven-word tweet devoid of context. "The president is a corrupt human tornado," it reads. She premiered the meteorological epithet last week with CBS News.

11:07 a.m. Letters have become as hip as tweets. Republican Sens. Charles E. Grassley (Iowa) and Ron Johnson (Wis.), release a new missive, dated Friday. The senators ask Attorney General William P. Barr to reveal any Justice Department investigation into alleged efforts by Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign or her allies to get Ukrainians to help dig up dirt on Trump and his former campaign manager, Paul Manafort. "Ukrainian efforts, abetted by a U.S. political party, to interfere in the 2016 election should not be ignored," the senators write. Ukrainian officials have denied any effort to help Clinton in the 2016 election.

11:18 a.m. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) goes on CNBC to confirm what his office has previously made clear. If the House impeaches Trump, the Senate must hold a trial under Senate rule and precedent. "I would have no choice but to take it up," McConnell says. This will come as a disappointment to Diamond and Silk, who call themselves "Trump's Most Loyal Supporters" on Twitter. A few hours ago, they called on the GOP to "enforce the rules to end the games," by which they meant McConnell should ignore the rules and not take up impeachment.


12:36 p.m . Trump's Twitter tally today stands at 13 so far. He has denounced the "witch hunt," called the whistleblower "Fake Whistleblower" and declared "the Bidens were corrupt!" He also raised the possibility that Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) should be arrested "for treason" for using words Trump never spoke to dramatize the president's call to Ukraine. Trump tweets #fakewhistleblower in an effort to get the hashtag trending, but at the moment the top trending tags include #civilwarsignup and #civilwar2, both references to another tweet the president sent Sunday quoting a pastor warning of a "civil war-like fracture" if Trump is ever removed from office. Most of these tweets are not from Team Trump.

12:49 p.m. Another data point from the political Twitter wars: Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) has about 25,700 retweets on his reaction to Trump's civil war tweet, which reads, "@realDonaldTrump I have never imagined such a quote to be repeated by a President. This is beyond repugnant." Trump's original tweet, by contrast, has 17,200 retweets.

2:39 p.m. In an Oval Office pool spray, Trump makes television of his morning tweets. "We're trying to find out about a whistleblower," Trump says. This may run counter to the whistleblower protections that are codified in law and rule. "In recognition of the importance of whistleblowing and whistleblowers to the effectiveness and efficiency of government, whistleblowing is protected by Federal laws, policies and regulations," reads a Web page maintained by the director of national intelligence. "These protections ensure that lawful whistleblowers are protected from reprisal as a result of their Protected Disclosure."

3:05 p.m. A national poll by Quinnipiac University finds that the share of American voters who support impeaching Trump has grown from 37 percent to 47 percent over one week. Among closely watched independents, the share opposing impeachment fell from 58 percent to 50 percent over the same period, while the share supporting impeachment rose from 34 percent to 42 percent. In a separate question, voters support the impeachment inquiry of Trump by a margin of 52 percent to 45 percent. That number closely tracks with Trump's overall approval in the poll, with 53 percent disapproving of the way he is handling his job and 41 percent approving.

3:30 p.m. Schiff signs a fundraising text for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. "Rest assured I won't back down from holding the president accountable, and neither will my Democratic colleagues," he writes. "That's why I'm reaching out." The ask is $5.

3:55 p.m. The House Intelligence, Oversight and Foreign Affairs committees release a subpoena demanding documents from Giuliani and three of his business associates. The documents concern 23 separate items, including communications about potential meetings with Barr or any of his associates.

4 p.m. CNN releases new national polling that closely tracks the Quinnipiac numbers. Young people are particularly drawn to the effort, with 65 percent younger than 35 saying they want to impeach and remove Trump from office, compared with 43 percent who felt that way in May.

4:07 p.m. The afternoon news dump begins. The Wall Street Journal reports that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo took part in the July phone call between Trump and the new president of Ukraine. The source is a senior State Department official.

4:19 p.m. The New York Times reports that Trump pushed Australia's prime minister to help gather information that he hopes will discredit the investigation by former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III. The sources are two American officials with knowledge of the call. Australian officials tipped off the FBI in 2016 to alleged Russian overtures to a Trump campaign foreign policy adviser. The Russians were said to have boasted about having dirt on Clinton.

5:11 p.m. The Post reports that Barr has held private meetings overseas with foreign intelligence officials seeking their help in a Justice Department inquiry that Trump hopes will discredit U.S. intelligence analysis of Russian interference in the 2016 election. This includes overtures to British, Australian and Italian officials. The sources are people familiar with the matter.
