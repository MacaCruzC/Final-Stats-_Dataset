Texto completo: WEST PALM BEACH — Claiming she was sexually assaulted by Jeffrey Epstein when she was 14, a former Palm Beach County woman has sued the late financier’s estate in Palm Beach County Circuit Court.
The woman, identified only as JJ Doe, is among more than a dozen women who have filed suit against Epstein’s $577 million estate since the convicted sex offender hanged himself in a New York City jail cell in August while awaiting trial on dozens of child trafficking charges.
The lawsuit is the first to be filed against the estate in circuit court here. It is where Epstein in 2008 was allowed to plead guilty to two prostitution charges even though more than a dozen underage teens had accused him of molesting them at his Palm Beach mansion.
In the lawsuit, the woman claims she was lured to Epstein’s mansion on El Brillo Way in 2003 with the promise of earning $200 to give him a massage. It was one of Epstein’s favorite ruses, Fort Lauderdale attorney Brad Edwards claims.
Once there, Epstein demanded that she take off her clothes, Edwards says in the suit. Epstein fondled her breasts and vagina while he masturbated, the attorney wrote in the lawsuit filed over the Christmas holiday.
“During the encounter, (JJ Doe) resisted Jeffrey Epstein’s advances and demands, yet was assured if she complied then he would stop and it would end soon,” Edwards wrote.
In addition to paying the woman $200, he paid the same amount to another teen who recruited JJ Doe after also being molested by Epstein, Edwards said.
Unlike some of the other women who are demanding as much as $100 million for their abuse, JJ Doe isn’t seeking a specific amount for her emotional distress and trauma.
In an email, Edwards said JJ Doe was not among the dozens of women who were interviewed by Palm Beach police and described encounters similar to the one described in the lawsuit. He declined to say where she is living now but indicated she no longer lives in Palm Beach County.
Like others, Edwards has filed suit in New York on behalf of other women who said they were molested by Epstein at his palatial New York City townhouse or other homes he owned throughout the country.
Delray Beach attorney Darren Indyke, a longtime Epstein attorney, wasn’t immediately available for comment about the growing number of lawsuits against the estate. In a will signed days before his suicide, the 66-year-old Epstein tapped Indyke and accountant Richard Kahn as co-executors of his estate.
In court filings in the U.S. Virgin Islands, where Epstein owned an island retreat, Indyke and Kahn have asked that a fund be set up to compensate Epstein’s accusers.
They have asked a judge to appoint Boston attorney Kenneth Feinberg to administer the fund. Feinberg has been involved in efforts to distribute billions to victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the Catholic Church sexual abuse scandal, the 2010 BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill and the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings
In a statement to The New York Times in November, Indyke and Kahn promised that Epstein’s accusers would be given “the opportunity to obtain appropriate compensation and to be heard and treated with compassion, dignity and respect.”
Edwards said he needs more details about the proposed fund. “We don’t have enough information yet to have a real opinion,” he said in an email. “ It could be a good thing, if administered fairly.”
For more than a decade, Edwards doggedly fought to bring Epstein to justice and unravel the controversial nonprosecution agreement that allowed the part-time Palm Beacher to escape federal charges.
After reviewing thousands of documents, The Palm Beach Post in November reported that then-Palm Beach County State Attorney Barry Krischer worked with then-South Florida U.S. Attorney Alex Acosta to craft the secret deal.
After Krischer agreed to let Epstein plead guilty to solicitation of prostitution and soliciting a minor for prostitution, Acosta, shelved a 53-page federal indictment. Acosta resigned in July as President Donald Trump’s labor secretary over his role in the Epstein deal.
Epstein served 13 months of an 18-month jail sentence in a largely vacant wing of the Palm Beach County jail — a cell he was allowed to leave 12 hours a day, six days a week.
After one of Edwards’ clients filed suit claiming she was molested by Epstein while he was on work release, Gov. Ron DeSantis in August ordered the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to investigate the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office.
The state police agency is also investigating why Krischer failed to pursue Epstein on child molestation charges. The Post has sued to spur the release of grand jury documents that could explain Krischer’s decision-making. Those involved in the FDLE investigation said they want also want records of the secret proceedings.
While Acosta stepped down from his federal post, a congressional committee wants more information.
The U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Reform last week sent letters to the U.S. Justice Department and FDLE asking for information about the nonprosecution deal and Epstein’s treatment while in county custody.
U.S. Rep. Lois Frankel, D-West Palm Beach, said Acosta, Krischer and Sheriff Ric Bradshaw could be called to testify.
“I know they are serious about looking at the Epstein case,” she told The Post last week.

Texto completo: TOPEKA — Capital city native Ben Lerner got a kick out of learning this past weekend that his novel, “The Topeka School,” was among former President Barack Obama’s favorite books of 2019.
“Since my book is in part about the pre-history of our political present, it’s fascinating and flattering to imagine Obama reading it,” Lerner said in an email Monday. “I disagreed with all sorts of Obama policies — from his drone wars to his bailout of the super rich — but it’s nice to remember that we’ve had Presidents capable of reading books.”
Obama continued his annual tradition of publicly highlighting his favorite books, movies and music by making public Saturday on Social Media a list of 19 books he said made the past year “a little brighter” for him.
Those included “The Topeka School,” the third novel by Lerner, a professor of English at Brooklyn College whom The Capital-Journal recently named as a “Distinguished Kansan” for 2019.
“The Topeka School” was named one of the top 10 books of 2019 by publications that included the New York Times and the Washington Post. It was chosen as a “Best Book” for October 2019 by Amazon.com.
The latter’s review said: “A high school debate champion growing up in Topeka, Kansas, sounds like a fairly conventional character for a novel. But this is not a conventional novel — it builds through shifting points of view, and it is a book concerned with language and cultural expectation, and how one conveys the other. By the end, you begin to realize that it is a story about how we reached the national state of consciousness we inhabit today.”
“The Topeka School” focuses on the dramas and dangers of being a person — or a nation — enthralled, bombarded and imprisoned by rhetoric, according to the magazine “The Atlantic.”
Lerner talked in September with The Capital-Journal about how his novel channels readers through a teenager’s world of the 1990s to an environment capable of nourishing the rise of President Donald Trump.
The 304-page book, which was published Oct. 1, shares the experiences of renowned Topeka High School debater Adam Gordon and his parents, psychiatric professionals Jane and Jonathan.
The characters were loosely based on Lerner — who earned a national forensics championship in 1997 while attending Topeka High — and his parents, Steve and Harriet Lerner, who worked at Topeka’s Menninger Clinic. Harriet Lerner authored “The Dance of Anger,” a New York Times bestseller.
Like Lerner, Obama had family members who moved to Topeka — but lived here only briefly, in the mid 1920s. Obama’s great-grandmother died here of suicide in 1926.

Texto completo: Los manifestantes que irrumpieron este martes en la embajada de Bagdad, Irak , y provocaron incendios en su interior gritaron desde fuera de la sede diplomática “ Muerte a Estados Unidos “. Manifestantes y combatientes de milicias mostraron así su enfado por los ataques estadounidenses que provocaron el pasado fin de semana la muerte de 24 miembros de una milicia respaldada por Irán.
Los hombres, según the New York Times, no consiguieron entrar al edificio principal de la embajada pero desde el exterior gritaron, arrojaron piedras y dibujaron grafitis en los muros para exigir a EEUU que retiraran sus fuerzas aéreas de Irak.
La situación seguía siendo delicada y los manifestantes incluso amenazaron con acampar a las afueras de los edificios estadounidenses. Su entrada en una de las zonas más vigiladas de la capital iraquí sugiere que las autoridades del país, que simpatizan con sus reivindicaciones, hicieron la vista gorda .
El presidente Donald Trump salió rápidamente a condenar la irrupción en el complejo de la embajada, que tachó de “ataque” y responsabilizó al gobierno iraquí por descuidar la vigilancia compartida de la sede diplomática.
“Irán mató a un contratista estadounidense e hirió a muchos. Respondimos con fuerza como seguiremos haciendo siempre “, tuiteó el presidente. “Ahora Irán está orquestando un ataque en la embajada estadounidense en Irak. Los consideraremos los únicos responsables. Además, esperamos que Irak use sus fuerzas para proteger la embajada. ¡Y así se lo hemos hecho saber!”, exclamó Trump en la red social.
Iran killed an American contractor, wounding many. We strongly responded, and always will. Now Iran is orchestrating an attack on the U.S. Embassy in Iraq. They will be held fully responsible. In addition, we expect Iraq to use its forces to protect the Embassy, and so notified!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 31, 2019

Texto completo: We met singer and author Julian Lennon when he was in Manhattan recently. He just finished his book "Love the Earth," the last in his "White Feather Flier" trilogy, and we talked to him about that and his career as a photographer and musician.
Was one of your life goals to write a book series?
No, not at all. Four years ago I didn't have a clue. Actually, the co-writer, Bart [Davis], he was a dear friend of mine. He was a New York Times bestseller, so he's written some incredible books. And we were talking about doing a biography on my life and what I've been up to. And as he was researching my life, he discovered the White Feather Foundation. And he said to me, you love the work that you do, but what about the kids? And I said, what do you mean? He said, you haven't done anything directed specifically towards kids. And I said, well, you know I taught them music. Perhaps photography to some degree, I had some reach. But then we talked further, and we came up with the idea of doing the children's books. We talked about - rather than just doing one, let's have a bit of a journey with the concept. And then it took a year each time to write each book because you want to make sure that when you're writing, you want to say things in the right way so that things aren't misconstrued or misunderstood.
When you were younger, was writing always your dream job, and what age did you start writing?
I guess writing to me came in the form of writing lyrics for music. That was a version of poetry - it's a version of storytelling. I think most of the things that I've done in life are versions of storytelling, whether it's through music, whether it's through documentaries I've made, whether it's through books.
What do you like to do most in your spare time?
I love to travel. Whether it's for work or for otherwise, I think seeing such diverse cultures around the world, meeting such incredible people that do so many different things around the world, that's one of my favorite things to do. And if I can't do that, then I love to power-walk through cities and take pictures as a photographer. I like motorcycles. I'm a biker. I have been since I was 11 years old. If the weather is OK, I'll get on a bike and just drive and go places I've never been before. You know, just open a map and go. And discover along the way - that's part of the glory, of the journey. Those are my favorite things to do.
If you had to choose between a writer or a musician, which would you choose?
I don't like the concept of being pigeonholed in any way, shape or form. I would fight against that in every way. For me it's about freedom of expression in every way possible. So if you want to be a painter, you want to be a photographer, singer, musician or writer, director, you should go for it all.
Is it harder writing a book or dealing with your fame?
Well, I'm pretty low-key on the fame front. I've learned over the years to deal with whatever consequences I'm confronted with in regards to being a public person. I try not to do the fame thing. It's not important to me. To me it's about being an artist and true to myself. So I don't have any problems with that. I think writing is probably, again, harder just getting it right. Getting it right and getting what you want to say across in the best way possible.
Do prefer being in the United States or England?
I prefer everywhere. I grew up in England until I was about 20 years old and then I moved to America. I lived in New York. I've lived in Los Angeles. I now live in France in a place called Monaco. I feel fortunate that my work carries me all over the world, whether that's America, Europe and/or Asia. It's nice to go home to where you live, where you have a home, but I love to see the world. There is no favorite except my own bed. There's nothing like getting back into your own bed after long, long travels.
Is it true you were an inspiration for some of the Beatles' songs?
Apparently, I was. There's a few songs out there, but the main one being "Hey Jude." Paul McCartney, my father's writing partner, when my father separated from my mother - that's another story - he felt sorry for me and my mom, so he wrote, originally it was "Hey Jules." Which is why my nickname is Jules. But it didn't rhyme so well, so "Hey Jude" worked better for him. And yeah, I think I've heard that song more than probably anybody else in the world. But still thankful, you know.
Do you sing in the shower, and if you do, do you wish that you could write in the shower?
Write in the shower? I think there are waterproof pens and things, work boards and things out there. Actually, I don't sing in the shower. But often ideas come to me in the shower. So if the phone is nearby with a voice recorder on it, I'll jump out of the shower just to put something in there, whether it's a musical idea or a lyrical idea or even a project idea. Why not?
In the past you worked with Bart Davis. Do you plan to work with Bart in the future?
I think so. Again, the whole reason he and I started writing was initially to write a biography about my life so far. So that is probably in the cards. But there are other projects, I'm sure.
What is your next project going to be?
I've got some music and photography projects coming up. In fact, one of the main projects coming up is that Bart and I are trying to get the book series made into an animated TV series. Once I've done the promotional book tour in L.A., I've got meetings with the likes of Apple, Disney and all of those guys to bring that to life. So, fingers crossed on that one, but that's one of the main next projects.

Texto completo: I agree with E.J. Dionne Jr. ( "A reason to remember what Christianity should be about," Opinion, Dec. 27) that Christians are divided into two camps just like the rest of the country. Had we honored the constitutional policy of separation of church and state, that might not have happened.
But the Republican Party blatantly seduced fundamentalist Christian leaders and broadcasters into supporting its philosophy of opposition to government-sup-ported social programs.
Loving your neighbor as yourself was OK unless your neighbor was female, black, non-Christian or an immigrant. I'm old enough to remember a better America that practiced loving its enemies. Under the Marshall Plan, we helped our enemies rebuild their countries, and the world was a better place for doing so. Practicing the Golden Rule does not require religious affiliation, but does require common sense, empathy and generosity.
MARGARET CURTIS, ATLANTA
Guest columnist offered refreshing viewpoint
I read with interest Bret Stephens' column, "Fallout on left and right from decade of disillusion" (Opinion, Dec. 26). I always found his columns in The Wall Street Journal intelligent and thought-provoking, as were his appearances on the weekly Journal Editorial Report.
I was saddened when he left the WSJ because I seldom read the New York Times. While he is definitely conservative, he is certainly not a Trump supporter.
I would be happy to see him take the place on your editorial page of any of your current opinion writers on the right, but especially Ross Douthat, Pat Buchanan or Mona Charen.

About the Opinion page: The AJC recognizes the diversity and differences of opinion among our readership, and we strive to accommodate this reality by offering both conservative and liberal opinion voices each day.And we recognize the variety of opinions even within the same side of the political aisle, and hope you do too.For example, some of our liberal writers have been critical of former President Barack Obama--much as some of our conservative columnists have criticized President Donald Trump, while others generally support him.We're continually looking at how best to bring you that breadth of opinion and balance both left and right, in print and online.

Texto completo: Former vice president Joe Biden is accustomed to fielding questions from voters about picking a running mate. But on Monday, he was asked a particularly provocative one: Would he consider choosing a Republican as his vice president?
“The answer is I would, but I can't think of one now," Biden said at a town hall-style event in Exeter, N.H., drawing laughter from the crowd.
“There are some really decent Republicans that are out there still, but here's the problem right now of the well-known ones: They've got to step up," he said.
Biden has emphasized the need for a future Democratic president to work with Republicans, stressing the importance of consensus to get things done.
On Monday, Biden made a point of noting that it was presumptuous to talk about a running mate, given that he has not won the Democratic nomination. As for his own vice presidential pick, Biden noted that there were “a lot of qualified women" and “a lot of qualified African-Americans."

Bernie Sanders is in 'good health,' his doctors say
Senator Bernie Sanders on Monday released three letters from doctors declaring him healthy, nearly three months after he had a heart attack while campaigning in Las Vegas, and disclosing that he no longer needed some medications relating to the attack.
One of the letters, dated Dec. 28 and signed by Dr. Brian P. Monahan, the attending physician of Congress, characterized Sanders as “in good health currently."
“You have been engaging vigorously in the rigors of your campaign, travel and other scheduled activities without any limitation," Monahan wrote.
Detailing Sanders' recovery from the heart attack, Monahan disclosed that some of the medications he initially required, such as a beta blocker and a blood thinner, have been discontinued “based on your progress."
Sanders, 78, also released letters from two cardiologists at the University of Vermont about his recovery from his heart attack, with one, Dr. Martin M. LeWinter, saying his recovery had been “uneventful."
Sanders' health has been under scrutiny since early October, when he experienced chest pains during a campaign event in Las Vegas. He then had two stents inserted into an artery. His campaign did not reveal that he had suffered a heart attack until after he was released from the hospital three days after being admitted.

Judge dismisses suit from former White House aide
A federal judge on Monday dismissed a lawsuit from a former White House official who had challenged a congressional subpoena in the impeachment inquiry involving President Trump.
Charles Kupperman, a former deputy national security adviser, sued in October after being subpoenaed by House Democrats to testify in their impeachment investigation into Trump's interactions with Ukraine. He had asked a judge to decide whether he had to comply with that subpoena from Congress or with a conflicting directive from the White House that he not testify.
Both the House of Representatives, which withdrew the subpoena, and the Justice Department, which had said it would not prosecute Kupperman for contempt of Congress for failing to appear, had asked the court to dismiss the case as moot. US District Judge Richard Leon agreed Monday in throwing out the case.

Texto completo: NBC News’ Chuck Todd offered a good reminder this weekend that many in the press view people of faith as regressive knuckle-draggers.

On Sunday, the Meet the Press host highlighted a letter to the editor from a Kentucky newspaper that claims only a person who enjoys “fairy tales” like Noah’s ark could vote for a man like President Trump. Todd called the letter a “fascinating attempt” by a Lexington Herald-Leader reader to explain the president’s support.

The letter itself states: “[W]hy do good people support Trump? It’s because people have been trained from childhood to believe in fairy tales.”

It adds, “From childhood, they were told stories that were fascinating but simply not true. This set their minds up to accept things that make them feel good. Later in life some people mature, study facts and cause and effect, and start thinking more logically, even if the results are undesirable.”

This reads like something copied straight from r/atheist.

The letter continues:
So you have this population that loves Trump because he makes them feel good. The more fairy tales and lies he tells the better they feel. Trump is a master liar who knows what makes people feel good and that is what he goes with. Sure, it would be nice if climate change did not exist. Show me a person who believes in Noah’s ark and I will show you a Trump voter. There are multiple solid scientific reasons the ark did not happen. Some people learn this and some don’t, and those who don’t will accept Trump. But can the world survive on fairy tales?
For the record, at least three major faiths — Christianity, Islam, and Judaism — believe in the flood narrative. We are currently in the eighth and final day of Hanukkah, and the fifth day of Christmas. This “fairy tale” slander is some excellent timing by Todd, especially coming on the heels of Saturday’s machete attack on a Hanukkah celebration in New York.

“Look,” said the Meet the Press host following his recitation of the letter, “This gets at something … that my executive producer likes to say: Voters want to be lied to sometimes. They don’t always love being told hard truths.”

Todd's guests, New York Times executive editor Dean Baquet and Washington Post executive editor Martin Baron, put as much distance as possible between themselves and the strange choice to hold up this letter as some kind of sound thinking.

“We can’t dismiss everybody that supports Donald Trump,” Baquet said. “I think we have to get out in America much more than we do and talk to people.”

Baron said, “I don’t want to be dismissive of people who support the president.”CTTodd’s promotion of the letter to the editor is not just a cheap shot at those who voted for the current president, but it is also an act of extreme cowardice.
Todd agrees with the sentiments expressed by the Lexington Herald-Leader reader. He just does not have the guts to claim ownership of them himself. By pretending he merely found the letter “fascinating” enough to recite on national television, Todd can claim he did not say that thing about “fairy tales” and Trump voters — the letter said it (wink!).
It only makes things worse that the letter isn't that terribly profound or insightful. It's really just the sort of partisan expression you'd expect to see in a letter to the editor, about the other side deluding themselves.

Not everyone is as stupid as Todd thinks. It does not take a genius to see why — of all the letters to the editor in all the newspapers in the world — the Poynter Institute's "media personality of the year" chose the one letter that claims Trump supports enjoy "fairy tales" like Noah's ark.

Texto completo: Dejó cinco heridos y una comunidad de judíos traumada; pero el apuñalamiento masivo perpetrado por un hombre el sábado por la noche en la casa de un rabino en Monsey, Nueva York, podría haber provocado consecuencias aún peores , según testigos de esta escena de terror.
Algunos de los presentes se enfrentaron al agresor y consiguieron contener su furia, asegura The New York Times. Posteriormente, el agresor huyó. Fue detenido dos horas después en Harlem, cuando la policía identificó el carro con el que dejó el lugar.
Josef Gluck, un hombre de 32 años, contó que el atacante, identificado posteriormente como Grafton Thomas, de 37 años, tras irrumpir en la casa con la cara cubierta por una bufanda empezó a ir de un lado al otro con un machete en la mano, “tratando de golpear a todos”.
“Hey, te atraparé”, le gritó. Él primero huyó. En la cocina, recogió a un niño pequeño, y luego salió a un porche. Después volvió atrás, y trató de enfrentar a Thomas. “Agarré una mesita de café antigua y se la arrojé a la cara”, dijo Gluck.
Otras de las personas presentes en la casa lucharon contra el intruso, lo golpearon con objetos y lo forzaron a retirarse, reporta el Times. Cuando Thomas fue detenido, aún estaba ensangrentado . De los cinco heridos que provocó presuntamente, cuatro fueron atendidos y ya salieron del hospital, mientras que uno permanecía este domingo por la tarde con fracturas en el cráneo, agrega este periódico.
El gobernador de Nueva York, Andrew Cuomo, definió este domingo el apuñalamiento como un “acto de terrorismo doméstico”. En su opinión, esta acción violenta —la última de una serie de ataques perpetrados contra la comunidad judía en la región— fue impulsada por el “odio”.
Por su lado, el presidente Donald Trump dijo que se trató de un ataque “antisemita”. “Todos debemos unirnos para luchar, enfrentar y erradicar el flagelo del antisemitismo “, agregó.
Mientras tanto, la comunidad judía del área de Nueva York y de Estados Unidos se interroga sobre cómo detener la creciente violencia antisemita, destaca NBC News. Muchos miembros de esta comunidad están aterrorizados , aseguraron líderes judíos y otras personas que forman parte de ella.
Cuatro funcionarios electos judíos en Nueva York pidieron al gobernador Cuomo que que declarara un estado de emergencia y desplegara la Guardia Nacional para “patrullar y proteger visiblemente” los vecindarios judíos ortodoxos de la zona.
Otras personas manifiestan incertidumbre sobre cómo abordar la situación. “No estamos seguros de qué hacer, porque no estamos acostumbrados a esto”, dijo el rabino Jon Kelsen, decano de Yeshivat Chovevei Torah, una moderna escuela rabínica ortodoxa en el distrito de Bronx de la ciudad de Nueva York.
Si por lo general las peticiones de más seguridad generalmente suponen la solicitud de una mayor presencia policial , algunos temen que más seguridad pueda obstaculizar el diálogo que Kelsen indicó como tan importante.
“En este momento, las herramientas que tenemos para la seguridad [son] más policías y más armas”, dijo Audrey Sasson, directora ejecutiva de Judios para la Justicia Racial y Económica. “Pero la pregunta para mí es cómo podemos construir otras herramientas “, agregó.

Big money and America's lost decade

Texto completo: Elizabeth Warren has been getting a lot of grief in the news media lately. Some of it, no doubt, reflects campaign missteps. But much of it is a sort of visceral negative reaction to her criticisms of the excessive influence of big money in politics - a reaction that actually vindicates her point.
It's true that earlier in her career Warren, like just about everyone else, did fundraisers with wealthy donors. So? Charges of inconsistency - "you said X, now you say Y" - are all too often a journalistic dodge, a way to avoid dealing with the substance of what a candidate says. Politicians should, after all, change their minds when there's good reason to do so.
The question should be, was Warren right to announce, back in February, that she would halt high-dollar fundraisers? More broadly, is she right that the wealthy have too much political influence?
And the answer to the second question is surely yes.
The first thing you need to know about the very rich is that they are, politically, different from you and me. Don't be fooled by the handful of prominent liberal or liberal-ish billionaires; systematic studies of the politics of the ultrawealthy show that they are very conservative, obsessed with tax cuts, opposed to environmental and financial regulation, eager to cut social programs.
The second thing you need to know is that the rich often get what they want, even when most of the public want the opposite. For example, a vast majority of voters - including a majority of self-identified Republicans - believe that corporations pay too little in taxes. Yet the signature domestic policy of the Trump administration was a huge corporate tax cut.
Or to take an issue close to Warren's heart - and her signature policy achievements - most Americans, including a plurality of Republicans, favor tougher regulation of big banks; yet even before Donald Trump took office, the relatively mild regulations put into effect after the 2008 financial crisis were under sustained political assault.
Why do a small number of rich people exert so much influence in what is supposed to be a democracy? Campaign contributions are only part of the story. Equally if not more important is the network of billionaire-financed think tanks, lobbying groups and so on that shapes public discourse. And then there's the revolving door: It's depressingly normal for former officials from both parties to take jobs with big banks, corporations and consulting firms, and the prospect of such employment can't help but influence policy while they're still in office.
Last but not least, media coverage of policy issues all too often seems to reflect the views of the wealthy. Take, for example, the issue of policies to combat unemployment.
Unemployment in the United States is currently at a historical low, just 3.5% - and we're achieving that low unemployment without any sign of runaway inflation, which tells us that we were capable of this kind of performance all along. Remember when people like Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, told us that high unemployment was inevitable because of a "skills gap"? They were wrong.
But it took us a very long time to get here, because unemployment receded only slowly from its post-crisis peak. The average unemployment rate over the past decade was 6.3%, which translates into millions of person-years of gratuitous joblessness.
Why didn't we recover faster? The most important reason was fiscal austerity - spending cuts, supposedly to reduce the budget deficit, that exerted a steady drag on the economy from 2010 onward. But who was obsessed with budget deficits? Voters in general weren't - but surveys indicate that even when the unemployment rate was above 8% the wealthy considered budget deficits a bigger problem than lack of jobs.
And the news media echoed these priorities, treating them not as the preferences of one small group of voters but as the only responsible position. As Vox's Ezra Klein noted at the time, when it came to budget deficits it seemed that "the usual rules of reportorial neutrality" didn't apply; reporters openly advocated policy views that were at best controversial, not widely shared by the general public and, we now know, substantively wrong.
But they were the policy views of the wealthy. And when it comes to treatment of differing policy views, the media often treats some Americans as more equal than others.
Which brings me back to the 2020 campaign. You may disagree with progressive ideas coming from Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders, which is fine. But the news media owes the public a serious discussion of these ideas, not dismissal shaped by a combination of reflexive "centrist bias" and the conscious or unconscious assumption that any policy rich people dislike must be irresponsible.
And when candidates talk about the excessive influence of the wealthy, that subject also deserves serious discussion, not the cheap shots we've been seeing lately. I know that this kind of discussion makes many journalists uncomfortable. That's exactly why we need to have it.

Keep Our Rivers Flowing Freely

Texto completo: Permanent protections for free-flowing rivers need to be a centerpiece of every country's national climate action plan. Chile can lead the way.
The rivers of Chilean Patagonia cascade from snow-capped mountains through sheer rock facades and rolling hills, radiating bright turquoise, deep blues and vivid greens. The Puelo. The Pascua. The Futaleufú. Each is as breathtaking and unique as the landscape it quenches.
But these rivers, like many worldwide, have been threatened by dam projects that aim to provide power for distant cities and mining operations. Only one-third of the world's 177 longest rivers remain free flowing, and just 21 rivers longer than 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) retain a direct connection to the sea.
If we are to arrest global climate change, prevent the toxifying of freshwater sources and do right by all those who depend on rivers for survival, we must return more rivers to their natural state.
For decades, rivers have been an afterthought in global climate talks, like the ones that concluded in Madrid this month. New streams of climate finance, like the Climate Bonds Initiative, may soon be available to large-scale hydropower projects. While renewable energy and its financing are an important part of climate solutions, hydropower dams are not the answer.
Hydropower is not a clean, green technology. Rivers help regulate an increasingly volatile global carbon cycle by transporting decaying organic material from land to sea, where it settles on the ocean floor. This draws an estimated 200 million tons of carbon out of the air each year.
As an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scientist, Philip Fearnside, has documented, large dams, especially on tropical rivers like the Amazon, are "methane factories," emitting in some cases more greenhouse gases than coal-fired power plants. This month in Madrid, 276 civil society groups attending the United Nations climate talks called on the Climate Bonds Initiative to exclude hydropower from climate financing.
Hydroelectric dams, when they are built, flood large areas of vegetation. This fuels decomposition and releases carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. Considered as a whole, hydroelectric dams emit a billion tons of greenhouse gases per year. This is comparable to the aviation industry, which emitted over 900 million tons of greenhouse gases in 2018.
Damming rivers affects both people and ecosystems. More than 60 million people in developing countries depend on lakes and rivers for their livelihoods. An estimated 80 million people have already been displaced by dam projects worldwide. The United Nations estimates that around one million animal and plant species are threatened with extinction, at least in part because of damming, river pollution, diversion for industrial agriculture and overfishing.
For more than a decade, Chilean environmentalists have been fighting dam projects. In 2006, the Chilean energy corporation Endesa proposed to build five major dams in the Aysén region, a sparsely populated area in the south of Chile that is home to one of the world's largest ice fields outside of Antarctica and Greenland.
This dam project, called HidroAysén, would have flooded nearly 15,000 acres of forests to transmit power to distant cities and to fuel the country's copper industry, which accounts for as much as 10 percent of Chile's G.D.P. But at what cost?
A 2009 study by the University of Chile found large dam projects unnecessary to meeting the country's future and growing energy needs. Communities threatened by HidroAysén organized. Across Chile, thousands of people took to the streets in more than a dozen cities. Environmentalists challenged the proposed dams in courts.
In spite of the government's initial eagerness to greenlight HidroAysén, the Committee of Ministers scuttled the project in 2014, in recognition of the significant impacts the project would have had on one of Chile's most iconic regions.
The current movement to protect Patagonia's free-flowing rivers stands on the shoulders of the United States Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, passed in 1968, which protects 13,413 free-flowing miles of 226 rivers in 41 states and Puerto Rico.
Several Chilean organizations are working on Ley Ríos Salvajes, a campaign to create a wild rivers law. This places Chile at the forefront of countries using river protections as a means of adapting to and offsetting climate change.
Our efforts are also buoyed by recent developments that have seen legal rights granted to rivers in New Zealand and Bangladesh. Many international organizations, among them Rivers Without Boundaries and World Heritage Watch, contributed to the "Heritage Dammed" report, published in June, which calls for rivers to receive the same recognition and protection as the UNESCO World Heritage Sites they nourish.
This could grant renewed protections for some of the world's most cherished rivers -- among them the Nu-Salween and the Tigris -- permanent legal protection from damming, diversion and pollution.
Countries that were the first to participate in a dam-building boom have started to dismantle or partly decommission their dams. In the United States, over 1,600 obsolete dams have been removed. The current five-year plan for economic and social development in China includes an effort to reconnect rivers, reversing years of unchecked dam construction that has contributed to the disappearance of more than half of the country's 50,000 rivers.
We are organizing to protect Chilean rivers from a similar fate. Rivers will be irrevocably changed if the Chilean government doesn't grant them permanent legal protection. If the global community cares about the climate, it needs to do a lot better by its rivers.

Texto completo: NYT Mag Labs team, a small creative studio attached to the magazine that tackles special projects and special newspaper sections. 1619 Project In August, The New York Times Magazine launched The 1619 Project, marking the 400th anniversary of the start of American slavery with a New York Times Magazine issue and special broadsheet section. The project sought to reframe the way we understand slavery and its legacy, cataloging the link between slavery and contemporary American society, as well as the contributions of black Americans in bringing to life the country's founding ideals. The special issue and broadsheet section sold out in about a day when it was put online in the New York Times Store. There was a waiting list of 35,000 people until last week when the Times Store released more copies. The 1619 Project's podcast series was the most-downloaded podcast in the United States. The Times turned the project into a school curriculum with The Pulitzer Center and more than 3,000 teachers say they are using it in their classrooms. Copies of The 1619 Project magazine and broadsheet section have been sent to over 500 schools in some 91 cities and towns in 30 states, including every public high school in Chicago, Washington, D.C.; Newark, Buffalo, Winston-Salem/Forsyth County, N.C., and Wilmington, Del. Altogether The Times and the Pulitzer Center have distributed more than 200,000 free copies of The 1619 Project to schools, libraries, museums and various events. A 1619 book project is underway. The Kids Section Did you catch The Funny Issue? What about The Comics Issue -- and the 10 other New York Times for Kids issues? 2019 was the second full year of this special print section, which mimics the newspaper, but is just for kids. This year, the Kids section visited eight fourthgrade classrooms around the country, including in Miami, Minneapolis and Providence, R.I. There, editors talked with the students about the difference between news and opinion and worked with them to write their own well-reasoned opinions for the section's Opinion page. What do 10-year-olds feel most passionate about across the board? The environment, homelessness and screen time. The New York Times for Kids runs in the paper on the last Sunday of every month!

SEALs call ex-platoon leader 'evil,' 'toxic' in leaked videos

Texto completo: Navy SEALs described their platoon leader, retired Special Operations Chief Edward Gallagher, as "evil," "toxic" and "perfectly OK with killing anybody that was moving," in video footage of interviews obtained by The New York Times.
Gallagher's war crimes case earlier this year gained national attention after President Donald Trump intervened on his behalf despite strong objections from Pentagon leaders who said the president's move could damage the integrity of the military judicial system. The case also led to the Navy secretary's firing.
The footage published Friday was part of a trove of confidential Navy investigative materials that the Times obtained about the prosecution of Gallagher, who was accused of battlefield misconduct in Iraq. It shows members of Gallagher's SEAL Team 7 Alpha Platoon speaking to agents from the Naval Criminal Investigative Service about his conduct in sometimes emotional interviews.
They described how their chief seemed to love killing, how he targeted women and children and boasted that "burqas were flying."
The footage provides revealing insights of the men who worked with Gallagher and turned him in. They have never spoken publicly about the case, which has divided the elite fighting force known for its secrecy.
"The guy is freaking evil," Special Operator 1st Class Craig Miller says about Gallagher in one interview.
"The guy was toxic," Special Operator 1st Class Joshua Virens, a sniper, says in another.
Special Operator 1st Class Corey Scott, a medic in the platoon, says, "You could tell he was perfectly OK with killing anybody that was moving."
The material also includes thousands of text messages that the SEALs sent to one another about Gallagher's case and video from a SEAL's helmet camera that shows Gallagher approach a barely conscious captive -- a teenage Islamic State fighter -- in May 2017. The camera then shuts off.
In video interviews, three SEALS said they saw Gallagher go on to stab the sedated captive for no reason and hold an impromptu ceremony over the body as if it were a trophy.
Miller called it "the most disgraceful thing I've ever seen in my life."
Gallagher was charged with murder in the death of the wounded captive in Iraq, posing with the body in photos and shooting civilians. A jury of combat veterans acquitted him of all charges except one count for posing with a human casualty.
In the interviews, the platoon members told investigators that they tried repeatedly to report what they saw but no action was taken. In April 2018, they went outside the SEALs to the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, and Gallagher was arrested a few months later.
Gallagher has insisted that the charges against him were concocted by six disgruntled SEALs in his platoon who could not meet his high standards.
Reacting to the videos, Gallagher called the accusations "blatant lies" in a statement issued through his lawyer, the Times reported.
After his court-martial, Gallagher was demoted from chief petty officer to a 1st class petty officer.
Trump restored Gallagher's rank and has repeatedly tweeted support for him, saying his case had been "handled very badly from the beginning."
Gallagher, who was seeking to retire, was notified last month that a board of peers would determine if he should remain a SEAL.
Trump ordered the Navy to allow Gallagher to retire as a SEAL with his full rank intact. That led to the firing of Navy Secretary Richard Spencer over his handling of the matter.

Texto completo: 'Sesame Street' just celebrated its 50th anniversary, but surely the Muppets have been around longer than that. Jim Henson honed the Muppets' act in the early 1950s with a five-minute show on WRC, Channel 4, every weeknight. It was sponsored by Wilkins Coffee. I remember this as black-and-white TV, but can't call to mind a whole lot else that would help frame a time period. Does anyone else remember this early Muppets show?
" Harry Meem, Richmond

In June 1992, an unusual complaint was filed with the New York City Police Department. Jane Henson , widow of Muppet master Jim Henson , had allegedly thrown a punch while attending a trademark and licensing convention.
'One of my employees was physically attacked by Mrs. Henson,' a marketing executive named John T. Brady told the New York Times. 'With her fist, she knocked her across the booth.'
What had so enraged Jane Henson, whose 53-year-old husband had died of pneumonia two years earlier? Well, it all goes back to some of the couple's earliest creations: a pair of Muppets named Wilkins and Wontkins.
The two Muppets were used in ads for Wilkins Coffee, a firm founded in 1899 by John H. Wilkins Sr ., who sold coffee, tea and spices at the corner of 14th and Wallach streets NW.
Eventually, Wilkins focused on just coffee. His son John Wilkins Jr. took over. Junior definitely had coffee in his veins. After joining the Navy in World War II, he wound up erecting a Navy coffee-roasting plant in Pearl Harbor.
Jim Henson did not follow in the footsteps of his father, who was an Agriculture Department agronomist. Henson was in the puppetry club at Northwestern High School in Hyattsville. In June 1954, the summer before he started at the University of Maryland, Henson worked as a puppeteer on WTOP-TV's short-lived 'Junior Morning Show.'
Nine months later, his Muppets made their debut as part of a WRC show called 'Afternoon' that featured Willard Scott and Mac McGarry as co-hosts. But it was on an evening show called 'Sam and Friends' that Henson " assisted by his future wife, then-Jane Nebel " really came into his own. Making its debut was a character fashioned from an old felt coat of Henson's mother: Kermit.
'Sam and Friends' was produced in a studio in the Sheraton Park Hotel. The show's success enabled Henson to buy himself a white Ford Thunderbird. The show also caught the eye of Helen Ver Standig , who handled advertising for Wilkins Coffee. In 1957, she approached Henson and persuaded him to make ads for the company. One catch: The ads would be just eight seconds.
If anything, that focused Henson's creativity. The agreeable Wilkins will drink Wilkins coffee, but when offered a cup, the grumpy Wontkins won't . And because he won't, Wontkins is punished in all sorts of creatively gruesome ways: shot with a cannon, thrown from a tree, run over by a train.
As Brian Jay Jones put it in his 2013 biography of Henson: 'In Wilkins and Wontkins, Jim had created the kind of silly and endearing characters that were already becoming his trademark " the kind of characters that could even let him get away with being a little dangerous.'
The ads were a hit. Wrote one newspaper critic: 'The TV public, weary of looking at such things as gurgling stomach acids at work, took the Wilkins Muppets to heart. No TV commercial ever has known such popularity.'
Wilkins credited the spots with a 300-percent increase in the home sales of its coffee. In 1958, 25,000 pairs of vinyl Wilkins and Wontkins puppets were sold.
By 1992, Wilkins Coffee was no longer the presence it once was. (It seems to be defunct today.) It authorized marketing executive Brady to gauge interest in putting Wilkins and Wontkins on lunchboxes or in cereal or snack-food ads.
According to the New York Times, the booth at the trademark convention 'was plastered with photos of Jim Henson and the Muppets, and promotional material describing Wilkins and Wontkins as the 'Original Muppets Created by Jim Henson.'-'
Henson had always been careful about his creations. Though he and Jane were estranged when he died, she objected strongly " and apparently violently " to what struck her as an effort to cash in on the Muppets' fame. Lawsuits were filed, and the copyright case was eventually settled in the Hensons' favor.
The irony? According to Jones's biography, Jim Henson didn't actually like coffee.

Texto completo: Shall we dance?
Why launch a dating show or a dancing-competition show when you can do both at the same time? That's the idea of this hybrid series, "Flirty Dancing," hosted by Jenna Dewan, who previously called the shots on "World of Dance."
7 p.m. Sunday, KMSP, Ch. 9
Reporters' notebook
Even those who have followed the war crimes case against Eddie Gallagher will be startled by video of his fellow Navy SEALs turning him in, the centerpiece in the latest edition of "The Weekly." Some may have assumed this New York Times-produced series has just been a marketing pool to turn its reporters into TV stars. In a way, it has. But it's also spotlighted terrific journalism and the hard work that goes into it.
Now streaming on Hulu; 9 p.m. Sunday, FX
Road to nowhere
Minnesota native J.J. Kelley puts his experience as a filmmaker and explorer to use in "Lost in the Wild," a new series in which he teams up with journalist Kinga Philipps to retrace the steps of fellow adventurers who vanished. In the first episode, the pair travels to Panama to debunk the government's explanation of what happened to two hikers. The scenery is gorgeous, but the tone often feels like a new installment of "The Blair Witch Project."

Texto completo: In our last two columns you’ve read about some of the responsibilities of a director on a nonprofit’s board. You may now be thinking, “But why? I’m a volunteer!”
And so enters the lawyer to tell you why in two words: personal liability.
When is a board member liable?
While a board member is a volunteer and afforded substantial protection by law, when duties to the organization are violated (whether through acts or omissions), when certain taxes aren’t paid (notably, payroll taxes), or when a board member engages in self-dealing transactions with the organization or allows others to do so, personal liability may arise.
What are their legal duties?
A nonprofit board member, sometimes called a “trustee,” is a fiduciary — a person who must act for the benefit of another. In this case, a board member is charged with acting for the benefit of the public. It is a serious duty, and a breach of the duties can result in both personal liability and the loss of the entity’s tax exemption.
So what are those duties? In general, a board member owes the duties of care and loyalty.
The duty of care
The duty of care requires the following:
* Exercising proper business judgment based on the best interest of the organization (not its board members and certainly not yourself)
* Being properly informed on all matters voted on, and attending the meetings
* Appropriate information flow in and out (you’re obtaining all information you need to make an informed decision), and you’re not disclosing confidential information to anyone
* Following the organization’s Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws
A board member who violates their duty of care (for example, does not attend meetings, or ask questions about matters they don’t understand, or who, through inaction, allows a behavior detrimental to the organization to continue) can be held personally liable for any damage that occurs. There is a California case where a board, because they couldn’t agree on which investment adviser to hire, allowed a multi-million-dollar gift to sit in a non-interest checking account for two years. This caused the organization to lose significant income, and the board members were held personally liable for that. And, they were removed from the board by the Attorney General.
The duty of loyalty
This requires a board member’s faithful pursuit of the interests of the organization they serve and not the financial or other interests of the director or another person or organization. California law prohibits self-dealing transactions between board members and non-profits.
Serious fines can be imposed against the organization and board members if a transaction is entered into between the organization and an interested director, without steps taken to assure that the corporation did it for its own benefit in a fair and reasonable way that was approved in good faith by a majority of directors then in office (not just those at the meeting where the vote is taken), Did they know material facts? And, prior to approval, did the board consider and determine in good faith after reasonable investigation that they could not have obtained a better deal elsewhere?
Say, for example, the organization needs to paint its building. Director Dave is a long-term board member who happens to own a painting business. Dave offers to paint the building for $X and get it done in the next 48 hours. Board members cannot simply decide Dave is a good guy and deserves some business in return for his years of service, plus, he’s willing to do it quickly so why bother looking elsewhere.
No, the board needs to get bids from other painters and make sure that Dave’s price and quality is the best deal. Does the building need to be painted quickly or does that just to suit Dave’s schedule? Is the price fair? Is Dave properly licensed and bonded?
In other words, board members need to do the same due diligence they would for their selves. If they don’t, they could be liable for the funds lost by the organization. And abstaining from the vote won’t help you — if you don’t feel the board has done its due diligence, you will only be spared personal liability by voting “No.”
The IRS wants a word, too
Board members can also encounter unexpected tax liabilities. The IRS has its own rules against self-dealing (or what it calls “Excess Benefit Transactions”). If a “disqualified person” (someone who in the previous five years was in a position of influence over the organization, such as major donors, board members and executive staff) engages in a transaction with the organization that was to the benefit of the disqualified person, the IRS can exert a penalty against not just the disqualified person, but the entire board, for as much as 200% of the amount of the transaction. If Director Dave had been paid more than the going rate for his painting services, he and the board could face these penalties.
And finally, perhaps most shockingly, board members can be held personally liable for the unpaid payroll tax liabilities of the organization. If payroll taxes are not paid, the IRS will look to all responsible parties — the CEO, the CFO, and often board members — to recover the taxes. This is a very good reason for checks and balances for non-profit financial matters and regular audits.
Emphasis on service
It’s a privilege to serve on a non-profit board. First and foremost it’s a service to the community. To perform that service, always look out for the organization first. And. you should also be certain the organization carries Directors & Officers Liability insurance. It’s the smart thing to do.

Texto completo: Following the death of Barnard College freshman Tessa Majors, the school has received a number of racist robocalls promoting white supremacy.
Multiple university employees have received the same racist robocall in the wake of Majors’s death earlier this month. In the recording, a man blames the slaying of the 18-year-old student on race, according to the New York Times.
“We condemn this racist, anti-black act in the strongest possible terms and have referred it to the N.Y.P.D.,” a Barnard spokeswoman said. “Our community stands together against hate.”
The Christmas Day recording is just under two minutes and includes a rant about Majors’s parents, chastising them for allowing their daughter to spend time with people of other races.
“Remember to teach your children, ‘Around blacks, never relax,’” the man in the recording says.
The message ends by saying it was paid for by a white supremacist website called Road to Power, which has been behind other racist and anti-Semitic phone calls during the 2018 midterm elections.
According to police, the NYPD’s Racially and Ethnically Motivated Extremism unit is investigating the calls. Mayor Bill de Blasio announced the formation of the unit this month.
Majors, who was an aspiring artist and musician, was found on Dec. 11 with multiple stab wounds across her body in a park near the prestigious liberal arts college of about 2,300 undergraduates.
A 14-year-old is one of the suspects in her slaying. Police believe she may have bit his finger during a botched mugging and caused him to stab her in a fit of rage. Another suspect, Zyairr Davis, 13, was arrested soon after the death and charged with felony murder.

Navy SEALs describe Gallagher as 'evil'

Texto completo: SAN DIEGO - Navy SEALs described their platoon leader, retired Special Operations Chief Edward Gallagher, as "evil," "toxic" and "perfectly OK with killing anybody that was moving," in video footage of interviews obtained by The New York Times.
Gallagher's war crimes case earlier this year gained national attention after President Donald Trump intervened on his behalf despite strong objections from Pentagon leaders who said the president's move could damage the integrity of the military judicial system. The case also led to the Navy secretary's firing.
The footage published Friday was part of a trove of confidential Navy investigative materials that the Times obtained about the prosecution of Gallagher, who was accused of battlefield misconduct in Iraq. It shows members of Gallagher's SEAL Team 7 Alpha Platoon speaking to agents from the Naval Criminal Investigative Service about his conduct in sometimes emotional interviews.
They described how their chief seemed to love killing, how he targeted women and children and boasted that "burqas were flying."
The footage provides revealing insights of the men who worked with Gallagher and turned him in. They have never spoken publicly about the case, which has divided the elite fighting force known for its secrecy.
In one interview, Special Operator 1st Class Craig Miller called Gallagher 'evil.'
"The guy was toxic," Special Operator 1st Class Joshua Virens, a sniper, says in another.
Special Operator 1st Class Corey Scott, a medic in the platoon, says, "You could tell he was perfectly OK with killing anybody that was moving."
The material also includes thousands of text messages that the SEALs sent to one another about Gallagher's case and video from a SEAL's helmet camera that shows Gallagher approach a barely conscious captive - a teenage Islamic State fighter - in May 2017. The camera then shuts off.
In video interviews, three SEALS said they saw Gallagher go on to stab the sedated captive for no reason and hold an impromptu ceremony over the body as if it were a trophy.
Miller called it "the most disgraceful thing I've ever seen in my life."
Gallagher was charged with murder in the death of the wounded captive in Iraq, posing with the body in photos and shooting civilians. A jury of combat veterans acquitted him of all charges except one count for posing with a human casualty.
In the interviews, the platoon members told investigators that they tried repeatedly to report what they saw but no action was taken. In April 2018, they went outside the SEALs to the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, and Gallagher was arrested a few months later.
Gallagher has insisted that the charges against him were concocted by six disgruntled SEALs in his platoon who could not meet his high standards.
Reacting to the videos, Gallagher called the accusations "blatant lies" in a statement issued through his lawyer, the Times reported.
After his court-martial, Gallagher was demoted from chief petty officer to a 1st class petty officer.
Trump restored Gallagher's rank and has repeatedly tweeted support for him, saying his case had been "handled very badly from the beginning."
Gallagher, who was seeking to retire, was notified last month that a board of peers would determine if he should remain a SEAL.
Trump ordered the Navy to allow Gallagher to retire as a SEAL with his full rank intact. That led to the firing of Navy Secretary Richard V. Spencer over his handling of the matter.

Lovable ol' Bernie?

Texto completo: You won't hear young Democrats deride Bernie Sanders with the "OK, boomer" dig. At 78, he's actually too old for the cohort, but that's not why he won't get dinged. He's the most popular Democrat among the under-35 crowd, and judging by recent polling, he's the second-most popular Democrat overall. Sanders has raised nearly twice as much money as the frontrunner, Joe Biden, and seems to have scooped up support from a declining Elizabeth Warren in the past 60 days. Despite a heart attack that sidelined him for a week, he marches on, now buoyed by a poll showing that in a head-to-head matchup against Donald Trump, he would do better than Biden – though within the margin of error.
Sanders' appeal, the experts explain, is founded on "authenticity." Is he humorless, repetitive, cloying and rigid? Sure. But these are signs that he really believes something! He's not a packaged, blow-dried (no argument there), insincere pol cooked up in a political laboratory. He's the real deal.
Let's concede that Sanders is sincere, and that he is, with some small hypocrisies – did you know he was a millionaire? – honest. But what people actually believe is kind of important, and Sanders professes and sells a series of prejudices that do him no credit.
Sanders claims to be a democratic socialist in the European mold, an admirer of Sweden and Denmark. Yet his career is pockmarked with praise for regimes considerably to the left of those Scandinavian models. He has praised Cuba for "making enormous progress in improving the lives of poor and working people." In his memoir, he bragged about attending a 1985 parade celebrating the Sandinistas' seizure of power six years before. "Believe it or not," he wrote, "I was the highest ranking American official there." At the time, the Sandinista regime had already allied with Cuba and begun a large military buildup, courtesy of the Soviet Union. The Sandinistas, Sanders had every reason to know, had censored independent news outlets, nationalized half of the nation's industry, forcibly displaced the Miskito Indians and formed "neighborhood watch" committees on the Cuban model. Sandinista forces, like those in East Germany and other communist countries, regularly opened fire on those attempting to flee the country.
Sanders was impatient with those who found fault with the Nicaraguan regime: "Is (the Sandinistas') crime that they have built new health clinics, schools, and distributed land to the peasants? Is their crime that they have given equal rights to women? Or that they are moving forward to wipe out illiteracy? No," Sanders said at the time, "their crime in Mr. Reagan's eyes and the eyes of corporations and billionaires that determine American foreign policy is that they have refused to be a puppet and banana republic to American corporate interests."
Sanders now calls for a revolution in this country, and we're all expected to nod knowingly. Of course, he means a peaceful, democratic revolution. It would be outrageous to suggest anything else. Well, it would not be possible for Sanders to usher in a revolution in the U.S., but his sympathy for the real thing is notable. As Michael Moynihan reported, in the case of the Sandinistas, he was willing to justify press censorship and even bread lines. The regime's crackdown on the largest independent newspaper, La Prensa, "makes sense to me" Sanders explained, because the country was besieged by counterrevolutionary forces funded by the United States. As for bread lines, which soon appeared in Nicaragua, as they would decades later in Venezuela, Sanders scoffed: "It's funny, sometimes American journalists talk about how bad a country is, that people are lining up for food. That is a good thing! In other countries people don't line up for food. The rich get the food and the poor starve to death."
Sanders' stopped learning about economics and politics about age of 17. He still believes corporate "greed" is responsible for human poverty, and the world is a zero-sum pie. The more billionaires there are, the less there is for everyone else. "I don't think billionaires should exist," he told The New York Times. So in the Bernie ideal world, we non-billionaires would be deprived of Amazon, computers, smartphones, fracking (which reduces greenhouse gases), Uber, Walmart, "Star Wars" movies and very possibly our jobs. Millions of children would be deprived of school scholarships, while the arts, medical research and poverty programs would be that much poorer. Billionaires are not heroes, but by making them boogeymen, Sanders betrays his economic infantilism along with a large dose of demagoguery.

Texto completo: The next time you get a letter or email saying that you can save big on subscriptions to well-known magazines, beware: you could end with buyer's remorse. The state of New York recently announced a $16 million judgment against a company which sent subscription offers to consumers which promised big savings and appeared to come directly from well-known magazines, but instead charged consumers up to twice the going rate and often tricked consumers into renewing subscriptions that were still active.
New York's former Attorney General Eric Schneiderman sued Orbital Publishing and affiliated companies in 2015, alleging that they had mailed "millions of unauthorized and misleading magazine and newspaper subscription notices to consumers nationwide over a three-year period," noted a press release from current AG Letitia James. A New York appeals court earlier this month ruled on the case, holding that the company's practices were deceptive.
The solicitations appeared to come directly from well-known publications such as Consumer Reports, The Economist, Entertainment Weekly, Forbes, The Nation, National Geographic, The New York Times, The New Yorker, Newsweek, Smithsonian, Time, The Wall Street Journal, and The Washington Post and others. Several publishers sent cease-and-desist letters to attempt to stop the mailings, with little effect.
"In many cases, Orbital Publishing pocketed the difference between the amount they received and the actual subscription price," James noted. "Additionally, the companies also failed to 'clearly, conspicuously, understandably and readably' indicate subscription expiration dates on their renewal solicitations — as required by New York law — causing many consumers to renew subscriptions that had not yet expired."
In 2016, the Federal Trade Commission sued the same group of companies in an Oregon U.S. District Court, eventually leading to an $8.9 million judgment and the companies' banishment from direct mail marketing.
The magazine industry has been facing tremendous challenges the past few years. The rise of digital media, coupled with changing consumer habits, have forced the industry to change in order to survive and have cut into profits. But magazines aren't going away anytime soon. Ole Miss' Samir "Mr. Magazine" Husni — considered the nation's leading expert on magazines — is bullish on the future of the magazine industry. Husni noted in his blog earlier this month that more than 7,000 magazine titles are being printed in the U.S., with dozens of new ones being introduced each month.
But all that economic potential also attracts less-reputable companies in search of a quick buck. Consumer Reports recently wrote about the case, with columnist Penelope Wang giving some tips on making sure you get a good value for your magazine subscription. Here's some of her advice:
Verify new subscription offers. Check the validity of the offer by visiting the publisher's website or calling, and do an internet search of the name of the third-party seller if it's disclosed.
Look carefully at the details in renewal offers. "If the offer is for a renewal of an existing subscription, it should include your subscription number and expiration date, which should match the one on the publication's label," Wang advises.
Review the terms and conditions. Read conditions carefully; to cover themselves, some fraudulent offers might have conditions such as fees for canceling subscriptions of placing an order. Some fraudulent subscription offers contain terms and conditions that legitimate publishers wouldn't impose, such as fines for canceling subscriptions or fees for submitting the order. If you see these red flags, steer clear.
Many affinity and reward programs include good deals — even free subscriptions — for magazines. Check your airline, insurance company, credit-card issuer and other affinity programs to see if they have magazine subscription deals. You can also check out magazine.com, DiscountMags.com and other sites, on which you can often find great prices.

Texto completo: The recorded messages from a white supremacist outlet were delivered on Christmas.
The Columbia University community has been on edge for weeks since the killing of Tessa Majors, an 18-year-old Barnard College student, in a park near the schools' shared Manhattan campus.
Then, on Wednesday, came an unnerving development: A number of university employees received a robocall that used Ms. Majors's death to promote a white supremacist ideology.
In the blatantly racist recording, a man blames Ms. Majors's death, which the police have said occurred during a park mugging, on race.
The message ends with a male voice saying that it was paid for by the Road to Power, a white supremacist website that has been linked to similar racist and anti-Semitic phone calls in the past.
Audio of the recording was obtained by The New York Times. Its authenticity was confirmed by two people who had heard it and a law enforcement official involved in the investigation.
The calls were made between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m. on Christmas, according to the official. He said that it was unclear how many robocalls were placed, but that "numerous" messages went to people who worked at Barnard.
The New York Police Department's Racially and Ethnically Motivated Extremism unit was investigating the calls, a police spokeswoman said.
Columbia and Barnard officials, who called the messages "abhorrent" and "violently racist," said that the calls were placed to landlines at Barnard and Columbia, and that no students were believed to have received them.
"We condemn this racist, anti-black act in the strongest possible terms and have referred it to the N.Y.P.D.," a Barnard spokeswoman said in a statement. "Our community stands together against hate."
Ms. Majors was walking in Morningside Park in Manhattan the night of Dec. 11 when, according to the police, at least three teenagers attempted to rob her. She struggled, and one of her attackers stabbed her multiple times with a knife, the police said.
The police have identified three people connected to the attack. One of them, a 13-year-old, was arrested and gave statements to the police implicating himself and two middle school classmates, both 14, in the crime.
While Ms. Majors was white and all three teenagers are black, the authorities have said that there was no racial aspect to the crime -- a fact that was not mentioned in the robocall.
For just under two minutes, the unidentified caller uses racist epithets and rants about Ms. Majors's parents, criticizing them for allowing her to associate with people of other races.
"Remember to teach your children: 'Around blacks, never relax,"' the message says.
The man does not identify himself other than mentioning the Road to Power, an outlet that posts racist videos and comments on social media sites that cater to right-wing extremists. It was labeled "a white supremacist and anti-Semitic broadcasting outlet" by the Anti-Defamation League, which monitors such groups.
According to Oren Segal, the director of the organization's Center for Extremism, the Road to Power has been behind several similar robocalls attacking Jews, people of color and immigrants since 2017.
The calls all attempted to exploit national news stories by targeting the communities where they occurred with what Mr. Segal called "vicious, vile, offensive commentary."
In 2018, the Road to Power was linked to a call involving a racist portrayal of Andrew Gillum, the black Democrat who ran to be Florida's governor, as well as another one that used a racist caricature of Oprah Winfrey and racist language to attack Stacey Abrams, a black Democrat who ran to be Georgia's governor.
Mr. Segal said the outlet is the work of one man, whom he identified as Scott D. Rhodes, a white supremacist in Idaho.
"He promotes his hatred and division in the midst of these national news events and tragedies," Mr. Segal said.
Attempts to reach Mr. Rhodes were unsuccessful.
The Southern Poverty Law Center has observed a recent increase in robocalls across the United States, calling them a "new, high-tech, computer-delivered brand of hate."
Mr. Segal said that what makes robocalling an effective intimidation tactic is its ability to blanket a community in hate speech.
"One man is able to present himself and his narrative as something that appears to be beyond any one person," Mr. Segal said.
John Miller, the deputy commissioner for intelligence and counterterrorism in the Police Department, said the calls to Barnard and Columbia staff members came from an "entity" known for similar robocall tactics in the past.
The extremism unit, which became operational early this month, was built to combat the growing threat of attacks from far-right and neo-Nazi organizations.
Last week, the unit helped the Connecticut State Police with an investigation into a racist threat on Reddit made against the 13-year-old who was linked by the police to Ms. Majors's death.
"Time to exterminate the real problem," a commenter on Reddit wrote, according to the warrant. He later added: "I'm going to search for him myself tonight. Armed and read to fire. Then the parents are next."
The police charged a man, Trevor Spring, 31, with making the threat.
Edgar Sandoval and Ali Watkins contributed reporting.

Horrifying Death, and Hope Too, On the 4th Day of Christmas

Texto completo: According to the Christian calendar, the birth of Jesus is followed by the state-mandated murder of children. But somehow, hope breaks through.
The song "The 12 Days of Christmas" paints a whimsical picture of the stretch of time between Christmas Day and Epiphany. A suitor sends a series of lavish, if impractical, gifts to his beloved. Some have attempted to claim that the song contains coded messages related to the Christian faith. In reality, this song has nothing to do with the way that Christians are called to celebrate the season.
Within the narrative of the Christian calendar, the birth of Christ is followed not by leaping lords and milkmaids but by a massacre of children. The Feast of the Holy Innocents, observed on Dec. 28 by Western churches and on Dec. 29 by Orthodox churches, speaks a particularly powerful word to this cultural moment. It's a bloody story, out of which hope fights its way to the surface.
The story in the Bible goes like this: Jesus was born during the reign of King Herod. In the Gospel of Matthew, Herod is described as "disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him" by the news of Jesus' birth -- he perceives Jesus as a rival. A "furious" Herod then orders the killing of all the boys 2 years and under in Bethlehem. These children are remembered by the church as "holy innocents."
Scholars debate the historicity of the event because it was not recorded by the contemporary Jewish historian Josephus, who provides an otherwise detailed description of Herod's reign. Nonetheless, Josephus does tell us that Herod had three of his sons killed because he saw them as threats to his power. Commanding the slaughter of children would not be beyond the pale for Herod.
The Gospel of Matthew reports that an angel warns Jesus' family of the impending danger, and they leave the country. Jesus spends the first years of his life on foreign soil, in Egypt. When he finally returns from Egypt, his family cannot settle in their ancestral home of Bethlehem because there is still unrest.
The Bible story, then, depicts Jesus as a refugee fleeing a nation marked by political violence and being displaced within his own country even after some of the violence settles down. And though he avoids murder by Herod, he does not escape death by the state altogether -- three decades later, Pontius Pilate, an official of the Roman Empire, pronounces Jesus' death sentence. Like Herod, Pilate does so to maintain power and remove a threat.
Why is it important that the church calendar tells this story at the beginning of the Christmas season? Why should anyone care about the dates on a Christian calendar, especially in a time in which people have rightly questioned the excessive quest for power that marks some corners of the church?
The church calendar calls Christians and others to remember that we live in a world in which political leaders are willing to sacrifice the lives of the innocent on the altar of power. We are forced to recall that this is a world with families on the run, where the weeping of mothers is often not enough to win mercy for their children. More than anything, the story of the innocents calls upon us to consider the moral cost of the perpetual battle for power in which the poor tend to have the highest casualty rate.
But how can such a bloody and sad tale do anything other than add to our despair? The Christmas story must be told in the context of suffering and death because that's the only way the story makes any sense. Where else can one speak about Christmas other than in a world in which racism, sexism, classism, materialism and the devaluation of human life are commonplace? People are hurting, and the epicenter of that hurt, according to the Feast of the Holy Innocents, remains the focus of God's concern.
This feast suggests that things that God cares about most do not take place in the centers of power. The truly vital events are happening in refugee camps, detention centers, slums and prisons. The Christmas story is set not in a palace surrounded by dignitaries but among the poor and humble whose lives are always subject to forfeit. It's a reminder that the church is not most truly herself when she courts power. The church finds her voice when she remembers that God "has brought down rulers from their thrones but has lifted up the humble," as the Gospel of Luke puts it.
The very telling of the Christmas story is an act of resistance. This is how the biblical story functioned for my ancestors who gathered in the fields and woods of the antebellum South. They saw in the Christian narrative an account of a God who cared for the enslaved and wanted more for them than the whip and the chain. For them Christianity did not merely serve the disinherited -- it was for the disinherited, the "weak things" that shamed the strong.
Christians believe that none of this suffering was in vain. The cries of the oppressed do not go forever unanswered. We believe that the children slaughtered by Herod were ushered into the presence of God and will be with him for eternity. The Christian tradition also affirms that Jesus' suffering served a purpose, that when the state ordered his death, God was at work. Through the slaughter of the truly innocent one, God was emptying death of its power, vanquishing evil and opening the path toward forgiveness and reconciliation.
I once served as a priest at a church in St. Andrews, Scotland, that kept all the Holy Days. I gathered with a small group on Dec. 28 to receive communion and remember the innocents. Most in the group were at least 30 years my senior. One was in his last months of life after a long battle with cancer. I had very little wisdom to offer such a group, so I simply told them the stories of death, massacre and hope in the form of a child.
We weary few, gathered around the bread and the wine, reveled in our rebellion. Anyone who has visited Scotland will tell you that winters are a dreary affair, and the old church buildings with their odd angles can be gloomy. But in my memory that day was filled with light.

TikTok's biggest hits of 2019 - and 2020 predictions

Texto completo: TikTok has released the TikTok 100, a yearin-review list that names the top videos, genres, creators and memes that shaped the fastest-growing platform of the pastyear. The list highlights popular TikToks in topic areas like beauty and style, sports, pets and dance trends.
The most viral videos on the app included a science experiment conducted by YouTube star David Dobrik, a man doing surgery on a banana and a swimming pool stunt gone terribly wrong. Top memes on the app included #TikTokChecks (a format where users show off locations or objects as markers of their identity), VSCO girls (a youthful subculture consisting of scrunchies, Hydro Flasks and environmentalism) and "walk a mile," in which people create high-heeled shoes out of absurd objects in a riff on an Iggy Azalea song.
"The thing that continues to inspire mp is how much diversity and amazing content there's been on the app," said Vanessa Pappas, the general manager of TikTok North America and Australia. She pointed to the breakout success of Lil Nas X and the impact the platform has had on the music industry as a highlight of this past year. "TikTok has become a hotbed of talent, and there's so much discoverability on the platform that it can be used as this mechanism to discover new voices," she said.
The list, which incorporates views, likes, shares and trends into its rankings, showcases TikTok's power to generate conversation and drive meme culture. It also shows the app's role in introducing an entirely new type of notoriety into the online attention economy: TikTok fame. Being "TikTok famous" is a mark of status for teenagers. Clubs have sprung up to help those seeking it; countless young people goof off in their bedrooms with their phones for hours, hoping for a hit.
TikTok fame is different from fame on other social platforms like YouTube, Twitter or Instagram. Because TikTok primarily serves viewers through its algorithm-driven feed, you don't need a single follower on the app to have a video blow up. You just need to tap into the right trend, or do the right dance at the right time.
"There's something really attainable about TikTok fame. Anyone can post a video and it can be seen by hundreds or millions of people," Pappas said. From there, fame happens fast. TikTok creators on the TikTok 100 include Noen Eubanks, who made his first video a year ago in September and now has more than 7 million followers. Others include Chase Hudson, @ThisAintJay and Charli D'Amelio.
"When We think about TikTok it's this mobile-first platform and there's so many things about the format itself that speaks to meme culture," Pappas said. "Anyone can have a viral moment. Often we see creators take a topic and put their own spin on it and it really does have this viral effect. Because TikTok tends to lower the barrier of entry, creation is really being democratized."
Predictions for 2020
As the platform continues to birth new creators, Pappas said helping them make money is something the company is thinking hard about. She previously worked at YouTube and is deeply familiar with the tensions that arise between those seeking to make a living on social platforms and the platforms themselves.
"Creators are such an important part of our ecosystem, and monetization is something we hear often," Pappas said. "We're at the beginning stages of exploring different models and ways we can connect creators with brands and opportunities. We recently rolled out TikTok's creator marketplace that Connects creators to brands. We're definitely in that exploratory phase, but we're focused on what ways we can best serve our creative community."
Serving that community also means broadening what many would consider traditional creators or influencers. "The definition of'creator' is changing," Pappas said. "We're seeing this next generation of creators being born in ways we haven't seen previously. For me, what's been interesting is that now anyone can become a creator. People are owning their own voice, not having to express a polished version of themselves. When you look at other platforms there's different versions of yourself you're putting out there, TikTok is about being yourself, warts and all, and this new generation of creators is really embracing that."
It's not likely that news will be the company's future focus. "There are so many outlets to find breaking news, so I don't see TikTok as being a place for that. We're not a real-time platform," Pappas said.
However, the app is becoming increasingly political. Young activists use TikTok to spread political messages; users of all ages have begun leveraging the platform to share opinions on issues surrounding the impeachment inquiry, Trump administration policies, the 2020 election and more.
Misinformation is something the company says it's deeply concerned about heading into 2020. "I think as a platform of scale you can't not think about these things today and there's a level of responsibility we have to take on," Pappas said. "We want to make sure we're safeguarding our users from things like misinformation. We have a number of things we're beefing up; our policies, ensuring we have expert moderators who know how to define that type of content, what is misinformation, and ensuring we have the technology in place to scan for things like coordinated abuse. We're looking across the industry and
Because TikTok is owned by Chinese tech conglomerate, Bytedance, the app has also faced charges of political censorship. According to The Washington Post, employees of TikTok in the U.S. were pressured to censor "culturally problematic" content that might offend the Chinese government.
"This is something that I want to wholeheartedly stress: We do not censor any content based on political sensitivities," Pappas said. "Everything from the U.S. market is driven from the U.S. team. We have U.S. moderation team, our head of trust and safety is in the U.S., it's a U.S.-led operation. We don't do any type of censorship in that regard and wouldn't even if we were asked."
As TikTok continues to scale in the U.S., Pappas said American TikTok culture has already begun to affect international markets. "I think today's list of the top 100 is a really good example of everything that's resonating from the U.S. globally. We've seen effects that have gone viral in other markets, like green screen and TikTok text. It's been great to see how those trends have gone across barriers."
TikTok stars also are taking on the wider internet as they spread across platforms, racking up as many as millions of followers on YouTube and Instagram. Pappas has a goal that they don't abandon the app for greener pastures. "Creators are really the heart and soul of the app," she said. "We want to make sure we're supporting them, they're creating the amazing content people are coming to see every day."

North Korea shows Trump is a terrible negotiator

Texto completo: I'm starting to wonder if Donald Trump, bestselling author of "The Art of the Deal," just isn't very good at making deals. His presidency has been a ceaseless torrent of promises about what he'll achieve from negotiations with foreign leaders. But time and again, he ends up high and dry.
Right now, the administration is waiting to find out what the North Korean regime meant when it made the ominous vow to give the United States a "Christmas gift" if talks didn't produce an agreement on nuclear weapons and economic sanctions by year's end. No such accord has been reached, which confirms the bankruptcy of Trump's strategy.
He started out in 2017 by threatening Kim Jong Un with "fire and fury" if he made threats. But then the two agreed to a 2018 meeting in Singapore -- a made-for-TV spectacle that produced an agreement short on meaningful specifics. About all Trump got in return for giving Kim the propaganda opportunity was a halt in missile tests and the purported demolition of a test site.
At a second meeting in Vietnam in February, Trump walked out after failing to get what he wanted. That ploy didn't work either. Since then, Kim has carried out several short-range rocket and missile tests. Trump's response? "He likes testing missiles," the president said last summer with peculiar nonchalance.
All indications are that he's been duped by a wily opponent who is playing for time. Trump's former national security adviser John Bolton recently told NPR the North Koreans will never surrender their nuclear weapons.
"They're happy to sell that same bridge over and over again, but there's no serious chance they will ever voluntarily give it up," he said. "The more time they have, the more they can overcome all the technological and scientific difficulties to perfecting a deliverable nuclear weapons capability."
The China trade deal that Trump celebrated is underwhelming, leaving most of the important issues unresolved. Representative Robert Lighthizer admitted it was just "a first step" -- a far cry from the "epic" agreement Trump said was almost complete back in April.
Despite hitting China with an array of tariffs that hurt American consumers and companies, Trump has yet to get anything worth the cost he's inflicted on the U.S. economy.
As for the view from Beijing, The New York Times reported Dec. 14, "People close to China's economic policymaking process say that as the trade talks progressed this past week, the mood among Chinese officials gradually shifted from deeply worried to cautious and finally, by late in the week, jubilant and even incredulous that the hard-liners' goals had been achieved."
When the Chinese refused to sign a deal unless the U.S. agreed to roll back tariffs, the administration said no -- only to cave in the end. Lighthizer says Beijing agreed to buy at least $40 billion in American farm products each year, but the Chinese themselves have made no such commitment publicly.
It just may be the administration is greatly exaggerating what it got. That's what it did with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, a modest update of NAFTA that Trump pretended was a radical overhaul.
His negotiating wizardry has also fizzled against Iran. He abandoned the agreement the Obama administration reached to block Tehran's path to the bomb, calling it "a horrible, one-sided deal." But Trump's attempt to use economic strangulation to force the other side to submit has failed.
In response, Iran has taken steps that are forbidden by the agreement. So thanks to Trump, the Iranians are closer today to getting a nuclear weapon than they would be had he stayed in the deal.
Meanwhile, attacks carried out by Tehran in response to U.S. pressure have forced the administration to contemplate sending 14,000 troops to the region. Instead of making the Iranians more compliant, he has made them more aggressive.
Let's not forget the most conspicuous negotiating flop of all. Trump vowed over and over that we would build a wall on the southwest border and Mexico would pay for it. But Mexico has not paid anything and obviously never will.
Trump brings to mind Samuel Johnson's comment: "Men who cannot deceive others are often very successful at deceiving themselves." Maybe he blustered his way into a few good deals during his time in private business. But when it comes to high-stakes negotiations with foreign adversaries, he's a lamb among wolves.

Texto completo: Un giro inesperado para muchos se dio ayer cuando, luego de ser buscado activamente por 10 días, el tercer niño sospechoso en la muerte de la estudiante Tessa Majors (18) en Morningside Park fue liberado apenas unas horas después de ser capturado.
La policía está buscando más evidencia de la muerte por apuñalamiento de la estudiante de Barnard College, después de que el niño no identificado de 14 años fue liberado.
El tercer sospechoso había sido localizado el jueves en un apartamento en El Bronx . Fue llevado a la comisaría 26 en Harlem , donde le tomaron las huellas digitales y muestras de ADN, reportó Fox News.
“Éste fue un avance significativo en el proceso de investigación”, dijo el jefe de detectives de NYPD, Rodney Harrison, en Twitter. “Aunque desde entonces ha sido puesto en libertad bajo la custodia de sus abogados, la investigación sigue siendo muy activa. Nuestros detectives son los mejores en lo que hacen y están comprometidos a encontrar justicia para todas las partes involucradas”.
La policía cree que la familia del adolescente lo estaba escondiendo mientras se curaba una herida en su mano, consistente con un mordisco , informó The New York Times.
Éste niño de 14 años es uno de los tres adolescentes que se cree están involucrado en el horrible asesinato del 11 de diciembre.
La policía ya había arrestado a Zyairr Davis, de 13 años, acusándolo de asesinato grave y hurto, después de que supuestamente admitió haber participado en el robo, pero negó haber apuñalado a la alumna de Barnard College, nativa de Charlottesville (Virginia).
Otro sospechoso de 14 años también fue detenido, pero igualmente liberado luego de varias horas de interrogatorio por falta de evidencia el 13 de diciembre, dijeron fuentes policiales.
Supuestamente Davis, el único que permanece detenido, identificó como “el asesino de Majors” al joven liberado ayer , y dijo que los tres habían ido al parque a robar, cuando se toparon con la joven alumna nativa de Charlottesville (Virginia).
El caso sigue abierto. Quien posea información debe llamar a 1-800-577-TIPS (8477) y en español 1-888-57-PISTA (74782). También a través de la página crimestoppers.nypdonline.org o por mensaje de texto a 274637 (CRIMES), seguido por TIP577. Todas las comunicaciones son estrictamente confidenciales.
* Alerta: los delincuentes de Nueva York son cada vez más jóvenes
Although he has since been released to the custody of his attorneys, the investigation remains very active.
Our detectives are the best at what they do and are committed to finding justice for all parties involved.

As Pelosi plays games with impeachment, what now, GOP?

Información de publicación: Daily Herald ; Arlington Heights, Ill. [Arlington Heights, Ill]. 27 Dec 2019: 10.

Resumen: The House of Representatives impeached President Bill Clinton on Dec. 19, 1998. On Wednesday, Dec. 18, at around 8 p.m., the Democratic-controlled House passed two articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump. Pelosi acted after a Harvard professor and zealous impeachment advocate, Laurence Tribe, published an op-ed in The Washington Post arguing the Democratic strategy should be "voting for articles of impeachment but holding off for the time being on transmitting them to the Senate."

Texto completo: The House of Representatives impeached President Bill Clinton on Dec. 19, 1998. The votes, in which two articles of impeachment passed, were held around midday. By 3 p.m., the House had named its impeachment managers and physically delivered the articles to the Senate for trial.
Impeachment was on. The House, controlled by a Republican majority, was serious about its ultimately failed effort to remove Clinton from office.
Contrast that to today. On Wednesday, Dec. 18, at around 8 p.m., the Democratic-controlled House passed two articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi immediately announced the House would not appoint managers, and the articles would not be delivered to the Senate. The next day, Pelosi told reporters she did not want to talk anymore about it, and the House went into recess until Jan. 7.
Impeachment was not on, or at least a Senate trial was not on. Pelosi was holding out, apparently, for better terms in a Senate trial.
Pelosi acted after a Harvard professor and zealous impeachment advocate, Laurence Tribe, published an op-ed in The Washington Post arguing the Democratic strategy should be "voting for articles of impeachment but holding off for the time being on transmitting them to the Senate."
Withholding the articles, Tribe said, would strengthen Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer’s hand as he negotiates with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on the terms of the trial. It would do so, Tribe speculated, "because of McConnell’s and Trump’s urgent desire to get this whole business behind them."
Without concessions from McConnell, Tribe urged Democrats to withhold the articles indefinitely, because a trial dominated by majority Republicans "would fail to render a meaningful verdict of acquittal."
It seemed a far-fetched idea, to be generous. McConnell and Senate Republicans would be perfectly happy if they never had to hold a trial.
I asked one GOP lawmaker, via text, what the party’s reaction was. He texted back a one-word answer: "Laughter."
Nevertheless, Tribe’s idea took off in some circles of the Democratic left. His column was published on Monday morning, and by Wednesday night Pelosi had adopted his plan.
Just to be clear: Pelosi has no leverage over a Senate proceeding. The Constitution gives the House the "sole power" to impeach, a power Pelosi and her majority used to its fullest. But the Constitution gives the Senate the "sole power" to try all impeachments. The speaker of the House has no role.
Given that, Republicans have been wondering what Pelosi is up to. Crazy theories — at least they seem to be crazy theories — have emerged.
Democrats would impeach the president repeatedly. (That was actually a serious suggestion from a New York Times columnist in October.) Or Democrats would never send the articles to the Senate, to keep impeachment hanging over Trump’s head. Or whatever.
The key Democrats aren’t saying. But one plausible notion came from The Hill columnist A.B. Stoddard. There is, Stoddard said, "a lot of pressure on Democrats to wait this out until there is more to throw at the president."
It’s not clear precisely how that would work, because the House has already passed two articles of impeachment that make specific accusations.
Beyond that, withholding impeachment indefinitely in hopes that a federal investigation will come up with something big — basically what Democrats did in the Trump-Russia affair — might end in disappointment.
In any event, Pelosi is withholding the articles of impeachment. It is unclear how long she will do it, but it seems they will be withheld at least until Jan. 7, when the House returns for business. That alone will delay a Senate trial significantly.
In the limbo Pelosi has created, almost anything seems possible.

Texto completo: Lawyer and activist Anita Hill will give a lecture at the University of Iowa on Jan. 23 titled "From Social Movement to Social Impact: Ending Sexual Harassment."
The lecture, hosted by the University Lecture Committee, will be at the Iowa Memorial Union and is slated to begin at 7 p.m.
Hill made history in 1991 when she testified before a U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee about sexual harassment she said she experienced working for Clarence Thomas, who was undergoing a nomination-confirmation process for a spot on the U.S. Supreme Court when Hill testified.
Thomas was confirmed to the court, and Hill has since been an advocate to end sexual assault.
After accusations of sexual assault came out against Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh in 2017, Hill wrote an op-ed to the New York Times calling on the judiciary committee to take seriously the topic of sexual harassment after her experience testifying nearly three decades ago.
"That was over 28 years ago and today, in the wake of the #MeToo movement, the Judge Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court confirmation hearings, and the volatile social and political climate, Anita Hill is more important than ever," the description under the University Lecture Committee's Facebook event read.
Hill teaches law, women's studies, and social policy as a professor at Brandeis University in Massachusetts.

Texto completo: In 1924, the U.K.-based newspaper The Tamworth Herald warned of a dangerous craze that had "enslaved" the United States.
The paper described a "menace ... making devastating inroads on the working hours of every rank of society." People were "shamelessly" participating at all hours of the day. It was dealing "the final blow to the art of conversation."
The culprit? Crossword puzzles.
Yep, crossword puzzles, those grids of black-and-white blocks and often pun-ny clues that appear in the pages of newspapers. They were all the rage in the 1920s, until the nationwide fad eventually died along with the Charleston and pole-sitting.
Nearly a century later and we're in the "golden age of crosswords." Or so says Will Shortz. He should know: Shortz has been the editor of the storied New York Times crossword puzzle since 1993, and before that worked at Games magazine for 15 years.
"They have never been as popular, with the possible exception of 1924," Shortz, who lives in Pleasantville, New York, told NorthJersey.com. "Now crosswords are more up to date, they're livelier, they feel more modern. I think they're attracting a wider audience than ever."
'A good kind of torture' Once upon a time, crossword fans had to rely on newspapers, magazines or published puzzle books to get their fix. Now you can solve them on your tablet or phone via apps (USA TODAY's crossword app was a big hit with its readers), or subscription-based sites like The Inkubator and Fireball Crosswords can send them to your inbox. You can sign up for Queer Crosswords or Women of Letters by donating to specific charities.
"Now there are so many other options and venues," said Anna Gundlach, a puzzle fan and crossword constructor who lives in Portland, Oregon. "A lot of the distribution channels are able to be bypassed entirely."
The proliferation of independent crossword puzzles means a wider range of clues and answers and more provocative content. Puzzle editors at the New York Times reject puzzles if they decide a clue or answer is too obscure. Gundlach said the paper passed on one of hers because it referenced Bell Biv DeVoe.
"The American Values Club, which I've done a crossword for recently, has a more Gen X, millennial bent to it," she said. "Fresher clues, not afraid to swear or talk about sex."
Gundlach has had a nearly lifelong puzzle obsession. For Howard Barkin, a love of crosswords came late. He started solving them in his early 30s during lunch breaks to get his mind off work. Now he's 45 and a legit crossword puzzle champion. Barkin, who lives in Somerset County, finished first place in the 2016 American Crossword Puzzle Tournament in Stamford, Connecticut.
Shortz is the director for the contest, which pits the best crossword solvers against one another in seven games over the course of a weekend, culminating in a final round for the three finalists. Barkin's tournament victory came after solving the last puzzle in 7 minutes, 49 seconds.
The stress was high, Barkin said.
"Most people aren't used to solving a crossword with a timer counting down in a room full of 500 people," he said.
Barkin also constructs crosswords when he frees up time between doing dishes and raising two young daughters. He said his favorite to solve involve "extremely evil" tricks.
"A puzzle that breaks the rules, but for a good reason," he said. "A puzzle where you have to write a Greek letter into a square or something. It's a good kind of torture."
'Wow us' Even with a host of alternatives, the gold standard crossword remains the one The New York Times publishes.
"It's capital T, capital C: The Crossword," Gundlach said. "When people talk about 'the Sunday crossword' or 'the Friday crossword,' that's generally assumed to be the New York Times crossword."
Crossword fans use the hashtag #NYTXW on Twitter to brag about their finish times and offer their often-harsh criticism of that day's puzzle. The Dec. 12 crossword elicited reviews like "Ugh. So Bible heavy and then that twist? No." and "Ok #NYTXW sorry I don't know the ATOMIC NUMBER of NEODYMIUM?!?!"
The paper's associate puzzles editor, Sam Ezersky, doesn't take that kind of criticism personally. His Facebook banner photo is a foul-mouthed pan of one of his crossword puzzles.
"It's an obsessive culture," Ezersky said. "I get being so passionate about something like this."
Ezersky grew up in a Washington, D.C., suburb as a puzzles fanatic and sold his first crossword puzzle to the Los Angeles Times when he was 16 years old. He's 24 now, lives in Hoboken and spends his days sifting through some of the roughly 600 crossword puzzle submissions the New York Times receives monthly (via snail mail only). Some he turns down with nothing more than a glance. Either the grid is an odd pattern, or the words are meh.
"We're just looking for fresh things that really capture our attention," he said. "These days we really need the puzzles to wow us."
Ezersky does not construct puzzles as much as he used to, but he snagged a dream assignment this year, creating the annual "super mega" crossword that ran Dec. 15 in the New York Times' special puzzles section. It was a massive undertaking: a 50x50-square grid with 708 answers. It's so big the clues are printed on a separate page. Ezersky estimates it took hundreds of hours to construct. Still, he would have begged to do it if necessary.
"I know there were other constructors that declined because it's a such a Herculean task," he said. "If I could have been totally no filter and not cared about professionality, I would have been like, 'Please please please please please.'"
An Ezersky crossword from August shows how his mind works when he puzzles out a puzzle. He began with the across answer at the bottom left, where he placed "tech-savvy." He then stacked "heist film" right on top, giving himself the unenviable challenge of finding a down answer that ends with "lv." He did: "capital V."
Once the grid is done, he dreams up clues. He clued "tech-savvy" with "E-sharp?" — that question mark is crossword-ese indicating there's a joke or pun involved — and asked readers to get to "capital V" with the clue "Symbol for 54-down." The answer was "volts."
Constructing crossword puzzles can be agonizing, Ezersky said, but he wouldn't want any other job.
"My mantra to myself is I'm just getting started," he said. "I'm just humbled and grateful to be doing what I'm doing."

Fellini's Charming Farce About Fanatical Devotion

Texto completo: The director's first solo feature pokes fun at the fantasies and obsessions that fuel the entertainment industry.
"The White Sheik," which had its premiere in 1952, was Federico Fellini's first solo feature, and the essence of his style is present from the moment when a tattered canvas canopy appears on an empty beach, accompanied by Nino Rota's brassy carnivalesque score.
At Film Forum through Jan. 7 in a new 4K restoration, "The White Sheik" is not only the first but also in some respects the most charming, least overweening film Fellini ever made -- a comic fable of mass-produced fantasy and fanatical devotion.
Two wide-eyed newlyweds arrive in Rome from the provinces. Impossibly officious, Ivan (Leopoldo Trieste) plans a timetable for their activities, which include the consummation of their marriage. Timorous yet determined, his bride, Wanda (a teenage Brunella Bovo), has another obsession. She is addicted to fumetti (photo-illustrated comic books), with a special crush on the character called the White Sheik (the splendidly conceited Alberto Sordi in his first major role).
Ivan takes a nap. Wanda, who has been writing to the Sheik as "Bamba Appassionata" (Passionate Doll), sneaks off to the publication's office in search of what she calls her "real life." Albeit patronizing, the fumetti writers regard her as an oracle; she finds herself on the seaside set of the Sheik's latest exotic adventure, swept up amid the cast and crew. (Production is the opposite of silent cinema. When the director calls "action," the players freeze.)
Given a bit part as a harem girl, Wanda lives out her fantasy. So does the self-regarding Sheik (a plump former barber). Still in costume, he takes his devoted fan to an outdoor cafe where, recognized by the patrons and throwing caution to the wind, he sweeps her into a slow tango, whistling seductively in her ear.
Back in Rome, Ivan is engaged in his own subterfuge -- covering up Wanda's absence to his proper relations. "The White Sheik" is full of parallelisms. At various times both Ivan and Wanda are considered to be crazy. Ivan is as concerned with outward appearances as Wanda is inwardly directed. His desire for an audience with the pope rhymes with hers to meet her idol. The performers lunch on the beach, while Ivan dines in a restaurant with his bourgeois family. Fellini cuts from the Sheik's failed seduction to enthusiastic applause in the opera house where Ivan attends a performance of "Don Giovanni."
"The White Sheik" did poorly in Italy, though it was better received a few years later in New York. By then, Fellini's reputation preceded him. Writing in The New York Times, Bosley Crowther found the movie "surprisingly broad and ingenuous, in the manner of early silent comedies," identifying Sordi as "a student of the Mack Sennett school."
Integrating aspects of fantasy into a documentary backdrop, "The White Sheik" is an example of what would be called "rosy" neorealism. Several of these films, among them Visconti's "Bellissima" and Antonioni's "The Lady Without Camelias" (both made in the early '50s) similarly concerned the entertainment industry and, as in "The White Sheik," had actors playing "actors." Fellini pushes this strategy the furthest. The hapless Sheik's row with his harridan wife becomes an entertaining show for the production's cast and crew. Rome itself is inhabited by performers. A vivacious prostitute (the adorable Giulietta Masina, Fellini's wife) shows up and cuts a few capers in an empty piazza -- in effect providing a trailer for the director's later "Nights of Cabiria," in which she would appear as the same character.
"The White Sheik" anticipated or inspired a number of later Hollywood comedies, including Gene Wilder's "The World's Greatest Lover," Neil LaBute's "Nurse Betty" and especially Woody Allen's "The Purple Rose of Cairo." But farcical as it is, "The White Sheik" has a serious interest in fandom's quasi-religious pathology. The movie's spiritual twin is Billy Wilder's "Sunset Boulevard," made two years earlier and similarly self-reflexive in pondering the effect of the so-called dream factory.
It's not simply that both reference silent cinema and the original Sheik, Rudolph Valentino. "The White Sheik" is "Sunset Boulevard" in reverse. When the delusional former movie queen Norma Desmond imagines her fans, "those wonderful people out there in the dark," she is invoking star-struck Wanda. Whose fantasy is more potent?

Bret Stephens didn't understand Trump in 2016. He doesn't understand him in 2020, either

Texto completo: On a list of people who should be banned from ever dishing out advice on how to win national elections, New York Times columnist Bret Stephens is certainly near the top.
But here he is the day after Christmas with utmost confidence that he knows what is and isn’t necessary for the Democrats’ quest to defeat President Trump in 2020. (Stephens identifies as a conservative but coincidentally happens to share the same goals as Democrats, much like every other “conservative” writer in the national newspapers.)
“While Trump’s critics might be partly right about him, they’re a lot less right than they believe,” Stephens wrote. “In a contest between the unapologetic jerk in the White House and the self-styled saints seeking to unseat him, the jerk might just win.”
He went on to offer his best advice on “how to avoid that outcome,” which was more or less the same trite, useless guidance offered by the typical Never Trumper still unable to grasp that: 1. There was an election in which Trump was chosen and 2. If Trump is reelected, it will be for the same reason that any candidate wins a national U.S. election. (He won the argument with enough people in the right places.)
“What would work?” Stephens asks. His first proposal is “smart infrastructure spending.” Wow, who would have ever thought of such proposal, other than the Trump administration itself, a proposal that Democrats, if they weren’t devoting every shred of energy to impeachment, would have passed by now?
Without a flicker of self-awareness, Stephens also said it’s working against Democrats that “too much of today’s left is too busy pointing out the ugliness of the Trumpian right to notice its own ugliness: its censoriousness, nastiness and complacent self-righteousness.”
This is from the man who started that very same column by literally recommending “soap” as the fix for Trump’s presidency, because, he said, “America needs a hard scrub and a deep cleanse” after the 2016 election.
That’s how Stephens describes the vote cast by 63 million Americans.
The description of liberals as harboring a “complacent self-righteousness” is also from the man who this year devoted an entire column to calling Trump unfunny (yes, he actually did that) and in the past wrote that the only reason Republicans supported Trump in 2015 was because they wanted to lose the election. (He wrote in that same column that Hillary Clinton was certain to win.)
In light of this stellar record in political forecasting, Stephens maintains the most prestigious job in journalism.
Finally, Stephens offered that “the key to beating Trump is to treat him as the nonentity he fundamentally is.”
“The winning Democrat,” he said, “will need to make Trump’s presidency seem insignificant rather than monumental — an unsightly pimple on our long republican experiment, not a fatal cancer within it.”
Ah, yes. The campaign that beat all the odds and every machine working against it — the entire Democratic Party, the entire Republican Party, the entire national media, all of Hollywood, and all of academia — will certainly go down in history as “an unsightly pimple,” if only we once again ignore that the country elected the president.
Stephens, like every Never Trumper, still believes that the 2016 election happened to him. It didn’t happen to him, it happened for Trump’s voters. He doesn’t understand that and so probably shouldn’t be dispensing political advice to the rest of us.

Texto completo: KABUL, Afghanistan - The Taliban ambushed a peace convoy in western Afghanistan and abducted 26 activists who are members of a peace movement, a police spokesman said Wednesday.
The insurgents staged the ambush in the district of Bala Buluk in Farah province on Tuesday. The Taliban forced the six-vehicle convoy to a halt, then got into the cars and drove them and the activists to an unknown location, said provincial police spokesman Mohibullah Mohib.
According to Mohib, a police operation is underway to locate and free the activists whose convoy was going village-to-village to rally for peace.
Bismillah Watandost of the People's Peace Movement of Afghanistan, to which the activists belong, said that 27 of their members were abducted by the Taliban in the Farah assault. The different figures could not immediately be reconciled.
The Taliban, who have been active in Farah, have not claimed responsibility for the abductions. However, Watandost also said that tribal elders in the province launched an effort to negotiate with the Taliban to release the abducted activists. He added that phone lines were down in the region, making communication and getting information from the area difficult.
The latest rallies by the activists from the People's Peace Movement of Afghanistan started on Friday, first in southern Helmand province, a Taliban stronghold.
At a similar series of peace rallies in October, the Taliban abducted six activists from the movement in eastern Logar province but released them the same day.
Time and cost of relocation of US base in Okinawa to double
TOKYO - The relocation of a U.S. Marine Corps base to a less-crowded area of the southern Japanese island of Okinawa will take more than twice as much money and time as previously estimated because of the need to stabilize the reclaimed land it will be built on, Japan's government said Wednesday.
The Defense Ministry said the relocation of U.S. Marine Corps Air Station Futenma from densely populated Ginowan to Henoko on Okinawa's eastern coast will cost $8.5 billion and take 12 years, pushing its completion into the 2030s. That adds more than a decade to the plan already delayed by more than 20 years because of local opposition.
Under an earlier plan agreed to by Tokyo and Washington in 2013, construction was to cost about $3.2 billion and take five years, with completion expected in about 2022.
Michigan AG asserts Nassar probe not suspended after all
LANSING, Mich. - Michigan's attorney general on Wednesday said her communications director's statement declaring the suspension of a nearly two-year criminal investigation into Michigan State University's handling of complaints against sexual abuser Larry Nassar was "inadvertently misleading."
Attorney General Dana Nessel said in a written statement that the investigation is ongoing.
The probe, which began under Nessel's predecessor, has resulted in charges against three former school officials. One was convicted. Two others, including former President Lou Anna Simon, were ordered to trial.
"For the record, I remain deeply committed to finding the truth about who knew what about Larry Nassar at MSU, " Nessel said.
Songwriter Allee Willis, who penned 'Friends' theme, dies
LOS ANGELES - Allee Willis, a songwriter whose work included the Broadway musical "The Color Purple" as well as the theme song from the TV show "Friends" and Earth, Wind & Fire's "September," has died. She was 72.
The cause of death Tuesday was a cardiac event, The New York Times reported, but did not specify where she died, though she had been living in Los Angeles.
Willis was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2018 - more than 30 years after she won a Grammy for co-writing Patti LaBelle's "Stir It Up" for the "Beverly Hills Cop" soundtrack.
She was also nominated for an Emmy for the "Friends" theme song, "I'll Be There for You" performed by the Rembrandts but lost to the theme of "Star Trek: Voyager."
Burning Man organizers sue over US permit fees
RENO, Nev. - Burning Man organizers sued the U.S. Bureau of Land Management to recover millions of dollars they say the government has overcharged them in fees over the past seven years at the counterculture celebration.
Black Rock City LLC, the nonprofit that produces the annual Burning Man event, filed the lawsuit Dec. 13 in U.S. District Court in Washington.
Organizers told the Reno Gazette Journal they're tired of waiting over the past four years for the bureau to provide justification for the nearly $3 million it charges annually for a permit to hold the 80,000-person event in the Black Rock Desert about 100 miles north of Reno.
In recent years, Black Rock City has been required to reimburse the BLM, which provides law enforcement and oversight at the event, for its services and expenses.
Relief group: 216,000 have fled homes in NW Syria
BEIRUT - More than 200,000 men, women and children fled their homes in northwest Syria in buses, trucks and cars in recent weeks, amid intense air and ground bombardment by government forces, a Syrian relief group said Wednesday.
Government forces have been bombarding southern and eastern Idlib province, the last rebel stronghold in the country, since late November. A ground offensive that began last week has displaced more people and government forces have captured more than 40 villages and hamlets, according to the Syrian army and opposition activists.
The Syrian Response Coordination Group, a relief organization, said 216,632 people have fled their homes, many of them with no specific place to go. Many have been heading toward the Turkish border for safety.
In Chile: Helicopters on Wednesday dropped water on the outskirts of the Chilean port city of Valparaiso to extinguish a fire that destroyed about 150 homes.
Dozens of people living in the city's Rocuant and San Roque hills sifted through the ruins of their homes after the fire, fanned by strong winds, swept through their neighborhoods on Tuesday. Residents had been evacuated and there were no reports of casualties.
Interior Minister Gonzalo Blumel said authorities believe arson caused the blaze and urged people to report any suspicious activity.
The fire was doused in urban areas but remains "active" in the woods, said Ricardo Toro, head of the national emergency office.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani says liberal billionaire George Soros helped elected "anarchist" prosecutors across the country - a group which presumably includes Orange-Osceola State Attorney Aramis Ayala.
In an interview published this week by New York Magazine, Giuliani claimed he was "more of a Jew" than Soros, a Holocaust survivor and frequent target of anti-Semitic conspiracy theories, and ranted the philanthropist was a "horrible human being" in part for supporting the campaigns of district attorneys who ran on progressive platforms of reforming the criminal justice system.
A Washington, D.C.-based political action committee linked to Soros poured $1.4 million into supporting Ayala during the 2016 Democratic primary against incumbent Jeff Ashton. The sleepy Central Florida race became a major upset after the first-time candidate ousted Ashton and won the general election, becoming Florida's first black state attorney.
After she was sworn in, Ayala announced she would not seek the death penalty in first-degree murder cases, unleashing a slew of criticism and a legal battle against former Republican Gov. Rick Scott, who reassigned 29 cases away from her office.
"Don't tell me I'm anti-Semitic if I oppose him," Giuliani told New York Magazine. "Soros is hardly a Jew. I'm more of a Jew than Soros is. I probably know more about - he doesn't go to church, he doesn't go to religion - synagogue. He doesn't belong to a synagogue, he doesn't support Israel, he's an enemy of Israel. He's elected eight anarchist [DAs] in the United States. He's a horrible human being."
Giuliani was raised Roman Catholic, according to the New York Times.
Ayala, who has said she does not know Soros and did not solicit his money, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Giuliani's remarks.
The prosecutor rescinded her ban on pursuing capital punishment after losing her legal fight against Scott, which went all the way to the Florida Supreme Court.
In the interview, the former mayor of New York also accused Soros of "employing" FBI agents and "controlling" former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, who testified before Congress that Giuliani played a role in her removal.
The Anti-Defamation League, a U.S.-based international organization that fights anti-Semitism, said Giuliani's comments were "baffling and offensive" and asked him to apologize in a statement to The Daily Beast.
"Mr. Giuliani is not the arbiter of who is Jewish and who is not, or what is anti-Semitic and what is not," ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt said. "For decades, George Soros' philanthropy has been used as fodder for outsized anti-Semitic conspiracy theories insisting there exists Jewish control and manipulation of countries and global events. Mr. Giuliani should apologize and retract his comments immediately, unless he seeks to dog whistle to hardcore anti-Semites and white supremacists who believe this garbage."
A spokeswoman for Open Society Foundations, a philanthropy network founded by Soros, called Giuliani's remarks "contemptible" on Twitter and part of a "toxic" campaign to distract from Trump's impeachment.
Giuliani also told the magazine he trusted Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, his federally indicted associates accused of violating campaign finance law by funneling foreign donations to U.S. political candidates in an attempt to buy influence, because they "look like Miami people."
"I know a lot of Miami people that look like that that are perfectly legitimate and act like them," Giuliani said. "Neither one of them have ever been convicted of a crime. Neither one."
Both Gov. Ron DeSantis and Scott, now a U.S. senator, have said their campaigns would return thousands of dollars in donations made by the two South Florida businessmen.

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES -- Allee Willis, a songwriter whose work included the Broadway musical "The Color Purple" as well as the theme song from the TV show "Friends" and Earth, Wind & Fire's "September," has died. She was 72.
The cause of death Tuesday was a cardiac event, her publicist, Ellyn Solis, told The New York Times. The Times did not say where she died, though she was living in Los Angeles.
Willis was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2018 - over 30 years after she won a Grammy for co-writing Patti LaBelle's "Stir It Up" for the soundtrack of "Beverly Hills Cop."
Willis wrote hundreds of other songs, including pieces for Ray Charles, Sister Sledge and Cyndi Lauper.

Texto completo: Grandma Bruni lived in a working-class neighborhood in a two-family home that I’d struggle to describe — it was that ordinary, that humble. But it was known for blocks in every direction, at least around this time of year, and not because she went wild with multicolored lights or put one of those sleigh-plus-Santa monstrosities on the roof, the way some Christmas exhibitionists did.
No, it was famous because it was where Jesus was born.
And born. And born. Year after year, decade upon decade, in a ritual as reliable as the sunrise and equally comforting. Presidents came and presidents went. The economy roared; the economy whimpered. Friends moved away, favorite television shows went dark. But I could count on baby Jesus in all his plaster-of-Paris glory.
Grandma, you see, had this beloved crèche, but it wasn’t the kind of miniature tableau that enabled the entire sprawling cast of the Nativity to fit on an end table or a bureau. Hers took up a significant patch of her front lawn in White Plains, New York, and its centerpiece was a big wood shack, the pieces of which were hauled every year from a backyard shed and hammered together so that Mary and Joseph would have somewhere dry to hang out from the end of November until the Big Day.
They and their entourage were more than half life-size. It was as if Grandma had invited a large party of anachronistically dressed dwarfs to camp out in her yard for the holiday season.
But for most of December, something was missing: baby Jesus, who was perhaps three-quarters life-size. He would stay missing — metaphorically in utero, though technically in a bottom drawer of Grandma’s bedroom dresser — until the midnight moment when Christmas Eve became Christmas Day.
Grandma held to this schedule as if historical accuracy depended on it and White Plains occupied the same time zone as Bethlehem of millenniums ago. At 11:58 p.m. on Dec. 24, she’d dim the lights. She’d put on a record of “Silent Night.” And she’d fetch baby Jesus from that drawer, where he lay swaddled in her finest white linens.
Gently cradling him in her arms, she’d walk slowly through the living room, out the front door and over to the shack. Then she’d place him in a manger between Mary and Joseph. And she’d cry, because the moment was an emotional one and, she’d somberly inform us, this Christmas just might be her last. Her talent for pasta was surpassed only by her gift for melodrama.
Religion played a smaller part in her midwifery than you’d think. Grandma was nominally and notionally Roman Catholic and saw the church as the proper, even necessary, setting in which to mark the milestones of a life: birth, marriage, death. But that was as much about continuity — about a predictable rhythm, with reliable ornaments — as it was about creed.
Jesus was a character in a commonly adopted narrative, a lyric in a widely sung song. He was a totem. Above all he was a tradition, and the Nativity scene in front of her house went hand in hand with a Christmas Eve menu of seven fishes, in accordance with Italian-American custom, and with the rule that gift opening started with the youngest of the clan and proceeded upward in accordance with age. Doing things “the right way” grounded her. It was her center of gravity.
She died some three decades ago, and I’ve no idea what happened to that crèche. But I know what happened to the family who found it both bonkers and beautiful, extravagant and essential. In the manner of modern America, we scattered — pulled in this direction by work, in that direction by adventure, our commitments metastasizing, our free time shriveling.
We do better than most at forging moments together, but they’re less and less predictable. Where I could once tell you without hesitation how I’d spent the previous two, three or four Christmas Eves — with Grandma and baby Jesus — I now have to strain to remember. Last year, in a peculiar mood, I went alone to Las Vegas. The year before that? I’m honestly not sure.
That saddens me in ways that it would regardless of what’s happening in this seething country and this fractious world, but current events intensify my appreciation for customs now lost, for touchstones that have crumbled.
We’re at one of those junctures where so little can be taken for granted, so much is up for grabs. The worthiest of values come under fire. The sturdiest of institutions buckle. I’m sure I’m not alone in finding that holidays matter more, as do the familiar scripts and cherished props with which they’re celebrated.
They’re assertions of normalcy amid change and loss. The solace is in the details. Grandma understood this. She had a wisdom as ancient as the birth of baby Jesus.

Texto completo: When Dave Calhoun called the head of the Federal Aviation Administration on Monday, the incoming Boeing Co. chief executive officer purposely left other executives off the line.
That self-confident but personal management style, honed over nearly three decades in various industries, will be one strategy Mr. Calhoun uses to try to mend the plane maker's tattered relations with regulators, according to people who know him.
The most immediate challenge confronting Mr. Calhoun, who is 62 years old and takes over Jan. 13 , is persuading FAA policy makers that Boeing will be more reliable and cooperative in providing data to verify flight-control fixes for the grounded 737 MAX fleet. That would mean abandoning his predecessor Dennis Muilenburg's prodding of the agency over many months to accelerate vetting of the proposed software fix.
Mr. Muilenburg was ousted Monday, not long after Steve Dickson, the FAA administrator, publicly repudiated that approach and warned Boeing it had to produce more timely and complete information. In calls Monday to airlines, suppliers, pilot union leaders, lawmakers and the FAA, Mr. Calhoun and his team said their aim is to be more open and less confrontational, according to industry and government officials.

The underlying challenges confronting Boeing, more than a year after the first of two fatal MAX crashes that took a total of 346 lives, haven't changed. Mr. Calhoun and his management team may find it tough to depict themselves as reformers, since many of the same executives held high-ranking positions at the company during the development and marketing of the MAX. Even if Boeing makes more personnel changes, lawmakers and other critics say they will remain skeptical that Boeing has sufficiently revamped its culture or set a new precedent for its engineers or production workers.
Mr. Calhoun, a Boeing board member since 2009, also shares ultimate responsibility for the MAX's design and oversight of the company's response to the first accident in late 2018. The trio of leaders now atop Boeing—including new Chairman Larry Kellner and Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith, who will be acting CEO until mid-January—all share that history.
Boeing's board selected Mr. Calhoun to lead the company in part because he is familiar with the crisis and wouldn't need months to get up to speed on its complexities, said a person close to the board.
Analysts said they expect Mr. Kellner to concentrate on smoothing customer relations while Mr. Smith focuses on the financial community and customer compensation amid estimates that Boeing's ultimate price tag from the MAX crisis could top $20 billion.
Boeing declined to make Mr. Calhoun available for an interview on Tuesday. The company said its board appointed him CEO to restore confidence in the company and promised "a renewed commitment to full transparency."
Many FAA officials, frustrated by a pattern of delayed technical submissions, are skeptical of Boeing's latest promises. Foreign regulators have said they would independently vet changes to MCAS, an automated stall-prevention system that misfired and resulted in the accidents.
Mr. Calhoun also needs to change the company's engineering approach, former employees said. "You don't get your reputation back saying you're going to do things differently. You need to do things differently," said Jim Albaugh, who retired as chief executive of Boeing's commercial airplane division in 2012. "And the engineering part of it is key."
Boeing's problems with the FAA extend beyond technical issues. Regulators have faulted the company for failing to swiftly provide internal documents from years ago that appear to raise questions about the design and extent of pilot training for the MAX, according to people familiar with the matter.
The company's conduct in this regard could come under even more scrutiny, which Mr. Calhoun will likely have to deal with immediately in his new role. The FAA is currently examining how long ago Boeing officials discovered certain documents that it sent to the agency and lawmakers on Monday, and whether it should have alerted the agency sooner, a person briefed on the matter said.
Those documents, the contents of which haven't been disclosed publicly, include additional material involving Mark Forkner, the former chief technical pilot for the MAX, the people familiar with the matter said. They add to a previous set of instant messages from 2016 in the FAA's possession, which suggested that Mr. Forkner had concerns about the safety of the aircraft's flight-control system after encountering some problems in a simulator. Mr. Forkner's attorney said Tuesday that his client and other pilots had concerns with the simulator, not the flight-control system itself.
A Boeing spokesman said the company "proactively" turned over the documents as part of its commitment to transparency with regulators and lawmakers.
Mr. Calhoun will also have to work to repair Boeing's relationship with fliers. Boeing told airlines last week that its own polling showed around 40% of travelers world-wide are unwilling to fly on the MAX, according to materials reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.
Boeing has held calls with airlines this year to lay out plans for restoring confidence in the MAX and providing support to carriers when the plane returns to service. The plans described last week include testimonials from pilots, materials such as printed cards that airlines can share with pilots and flight attendants about the changes made to MCAS, and suggestions to help crew members reassure anxious travelers.
The materials in the presentations to airlines were earlier reported by the New York Times. A Boeing spokesman said the company is working to restore confidence in the company and the MAX.
U.S. airlines are planning their own demonstration flights during the period between when the MAX is recertified and when it returns to scheduled flying. Some airline executives have said they are hopeful Mr. Calhoun will improve relations with the FAA, helping smooth the process of returning the MAX to service.
Mr. Calhoun faces a major test on Jan. 29, when the company is slated to report full-year financial results. Outsiders will likely seek answers to how he intends to restore Boeing's reputation and reset a product strategy that has left it trailing arch rival Airbus SE.

Texto completo: The former president's annual year-end playlist never fails to delight.
The Grammy Awards arrive early every new year, showering knickknacks on the musical feats of the previous months. But this ceremony has long been the cheesy domain of record executives, session keyboardists and wearers of piano keys ties. For a more rarefied subset of music fans -- the world's B-side conversant -- the real action traditionally arrives in December, when critics' year-end lists begin rolling in via various choice magazines and newspapers.
Or at least, that was the case. The current media climate has felled such publications while chasing others -- including my twin totems, Spin and The Village Voice -- into web-only purgatory. A lovely culture magazine that once employed me as a music writer is now making its way in the world in part as a food court in Downtown Brooklyn. While a number of talented critics continue their yeoman's work, others have fled to more remunerative labor -- say, manning a child's lemonade stand. As a fan and critic, it can be difficult to know where to turn.
In recent years, however, one unlikely critic has emerged whose year-end list I find myself coveting: Barack Obama, who every December issues deliriously geeky inventories that catalog his favorite pop songs, books and films from the year. (He also issues "summer playlists" that include older songs.) His erudite book choices fall under his professional purview, and his movie picks seem fine enough. But Mr. Obama's music lists -- unruly, spiked with surprises and a tad quirky -- can truly sing.
As it turns out, the former president's ears really do protrude outward, swooping up a generous hodgepodge of genres and styles: hip-hop, rock ("dad" and otherwise), R&B and more. My favorite entry comes in his 2017 list, delivered as a nerdy asterisked addendum: "Bonus," he writes. "'Born in the U.S.A.' by Bruce Springsteen (not out yet, but the blues version in his Broadway show is the best!)."
Regardless of any feelings about the recent leader of the free world transitioning into a Nick Hornby protagonist, Mr. Obama makes a knockout music critic. Putting together these year-end lists is no picnic. When staff positions compelled me to assemble them, the task reliably bedeviled me. Year after year, I would cavalierly shun entire musical movements, turn my nose up at anything hinting of trendiness and punish personal favorites if they fell short of masterpieces.
A sentimental streak tripped me up: If a singer and his entire audience seemed on the verge of succumbing to old age, the artist was pretty much guaranteed a spot near the top of my list. In these faults, I was not alone; year-end lists tend to expose any critic's flaws.
Mr. Obama avoids such nonsense. While he retains some generational tics (he's sticking by U2), his taste mostly tilts toward fresh voices, an asset that eludes many professional critics: Meet the semiretired law professor with two kids in college, rapidly graying hair and a willingness to welcome Young Thug into his life. Through Mr. Obama, I have been hipped to the Congolese singer Jupiter Bokondji, prodded to give a closer listen to the hirsute country star Chris Stapleton and reminded of the unadulterated joy of Cardi B, J Balvin and Bad Bunny's "I Like It."
His prose, always electric, assumes an extra whiff of fire when applied to music. "American history wells up when Aretha sings," Mr. Obama wrote to The New Yorker in response to an email query about the artist in 2016. (True to rock critic cliché, he was then working a day job.) "That's why, when she sits down at a piano and sings 'A Natural Woman,' she can move me to tears," he said, adding, "It captures the fullness of the American experience, the view from the bottom as well as the top, the good and the bad, and the possibility of synthesis, reconciliation, transcendence."
Increasingly, I have come to recognize Mr. Obama as a fellow critic. Naturally, with such status comes bitterness and nit-picking. If the president digs Kurt Vile's garage rock, might he like Ty Segall? He obviously appreciates smart turns of phrase -- so where are his reads on David Berman and Stephin Merritt? And what, exactly, was he thinking in slighting Bettye LaVette's dive into the Bob Dylan songbook? Did he not even hear it? Surely, he could have nothing more pressing on his agenda.
But perhaps this is unfair. United States presidents tend not to be celebrated for their groovy record collections. The current officeholder's favorite Beach Boy is most likely Mike Love, which alone should qualify him for yet another impeachable offense.
If this is a bewildering time to be an American, so, too, is it a disconcerting time to be a fan of rock and pop, among the country's maddest and most characteristic concoctions. Barack Obama, music critic, has become an unlikely balm, his beautifully detailed lists acting as strange flickers of continuity and survival. In his Cardi B fandom, he remains a figure of hope. But if the former president so much as thinks of neglecting the new Raphael Saadiq record, may he be stripped of his Nobel.

Founder of Uber Leaves Board, Severing Last Tie

Texto completo: He has sold more than $ 2 billion of his Uber shares and on Thursday will complete the sale of his remaining stake in the company.
SAN FRANCISCO -- Travis Kalanick, the founder and former chief executive of Uber, has stepped down from the company's board of directors, severing his last tie with the business.
Mr. Kalanick, 43, started Uber in 2009 with Garrett Camp and turned the small start-up into a behemoth that defined the ride-hailing industry. Investors forced Mr. Kalanick to resign as chief executive in 2017, after a series of privacy scandals and complaints of discrimination and sexual harassment at the company.
Mr. Kalanick's departure from Uber's board ends one of the tech industry's defining stories of the last decade. During his ride-hailing company's meteoric rise, he came to personify the aggressive, risk-taking nature of a new generation of tech start-ups intent on "disrupting" other industries like taxis, hotels and food delivery.
"Uber has been a part of my life for the past 10 years. At the close of the decade, and with the company now public, it seems like the right moment for me to focus on my current business and philanthropic pursuits," Mr. Kalanick said in a statement on Tuesday. "I'm proud of all that Uber has achieved, and I will continue to cheer for its future from the sidelines."
The company went public in May in one of the most anticipated Wall Street debuts in years, but it has since struggled. Shares of Uber were $ 30.48 at the end of trading on Tuesday, about 33 percent below the price of the initial offering.
But Uber has turned Mr. Kalanick, who was Uber's biggest individual shareholder, into a billionaire. Before the I.P.O., he sold nearly a third of his shares to the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank for about $ 1.4 billion.
Since the initial offering, he has steadily sold more than $ 2.5 billion worth of his shares, and on Thursday will complete the sale of his remaining stake, a spokeswoman said. He initiated the sale of his last remaining shares on Friday and announced his resignation in a letter to the board on Monday.
Mr. Kalanick currently runs a venture fund and a start-up that operates "dark kitchens" -- cooking facilities that prepare food for delivery.
His resignation from Uber's board was not a shock, given his sell-off of the shares. "It's not surprising that he'd want to devote everything to the new project," said Bradley Tusk, the chief executive of Tusk Holdings and an early investor in Uber. "Combine that with the fact that there's not much to be excited about with Uber these days and it makes sense."
In 2009, Mr. Kalanick and Mr. Camp started Uber as a black-car service that riders could hail from their phone. Mr. Kalanick stepped into the role of chief executive in 2010 and oversaw a period of rapid growth at the company. He often flouted local regulations, pushing Uber to expand to new cities as rapidly as possible.
Mr. Kalanick's stepping-on-toes behavior became the cultural norm at Uber, which came to be known for its willingness to value growth at all costs. Uber quickly expanded into more than 70 countries and became the dominant ride-hailing service in most of them. It also started delivering food and developing autonomous vehicles.
But 2017 was a year of reckoning for Mr. Kalanick and Uber: A former engineer at the company (who is now an editor in the Opinion section of The New York Times) spoke publicly about her experiences of sexual harassment at Uber and said her managers did nothing to curb the behavior. A video of Mr. Kalanick berating an Uber driver who questioned him over falling wages also emerged. And revelations about Uber's efforts to spy on competitors and thwart regulators surfaced.
Other scandals came to light that year. A woman who was raped during a 2014 Uber ride in India sued Mr. Kalanick and the company after it emerged that executives at the company had obtained her medical records in an effort to discredit her. Waymo, a Google-owned competitor in the race to develop self-driving cars, sued Uber for theft of trade secrets. Uber settled both lawsuits.
The onslaught proved too much for Uber's major investors, and Mr. Kalanick resigned in June 2017. Mr. Camp, his co-founder, remains on Uber's board.
Dara Khosrowshahi, a former executive at the travel company Expedia, was appointed as Mr. Kalanick's replacement and tasked with cleaning up Uber's culture.
"Very few entrepreneurs have built something as profound as Travis Kalanick did with Uber," Mr. Khosrowshahi said in a statement on Tuesday. "I'm enormously grateful for Travis's vision and tenacity while building Uber, and for his expertise as a board member. Everyone at Uber wishes him all the best."
Mr. Khosrowshahi led Uber to its initial public offering in May. Uber's shares immediately fell below the offering price and have yet to recover.
One of the biggest concerns among Uber's investors is whether the company will turn a profit anytime soon. Despite a belt-tightening campaign, Uber posted a $ 1.2 billion loss and said revenue increased 30 percent annually to $ 3.8 billion in its most recent quarter. The company laid off more than 1,000 workers over the course of the year and cut other costs.
Investors have also pressured Mr. Khosrowshahi to pull back on the company's expensive autonomous vehicle unit and its food delivery service, which is struggling in India and elsewhere.
Crisis communications experts said Mr. Kalanick's departure might help the company's efforts to rebuild its image.
"A major priority for Uber over the last couple of years was signaling a shift away from the earlier era," said Jeremy Robinson-Leon, the president of Group Gordon, a corporate and crisis communications firm. "It's hard to do that with the ghost of Kalanick looming in the shadows."
While Uber has had financial troubles, Mr. Khosrowshahi has made progress addressing sexual harassment at the company. He released harassment and assault victims from mandatory arbitration agreements, allowing them to make their cases against Uber public if they choose to do so.
This month, he published a report that detailed the number of sexual assaults that occurred during Uber rides in 2017 and 2018, and settled a federal investigation into Uber's workplace culture for $ 4.4 million.
But Uber continues to face regulatory woes. In November, the company lost its license to operate in London, one of its largest markets, because of persistent safety issues. Uber has appealed the decision, a move that will allow it to continue to operate there for the time being.
Katie Benner contributed reporting.

Texto completo: In his reviews in The New York Times, he championed experimental choreographers emerging in the 1960s and '70s.
Don McDonagh, a fervent supporter of experimental choreographers as a dance critic for The New York Times and the author of critical biographies of George Balanchine and Martha Graham, died on Dec. 10 in Manhattan. He was 87.
Min Zhu, his executor and friend, said the cause was cancer.
Contributing reviews and articles prolifically to The Times from 1967 to 1978, Mr. McDonagh was one of the first critics to support the dancemaker Twyla Tharp when she began showing her provocative early conceptual work in the mid-1960s. (She was known to drop raw eggs on the floor during a performance.)
"He was a fair, intelligent supporter," Ms. Tharp recalled in a phone interview, adding, "This was extremely generous to me as a young person."
Mr. McDonagh's biography "George Balanchine," published in 1983, offered a detailed, analytical study of individual ballets by the New York City Ballet's founding choreographer while providing illuminating insights to those new to his work.
He used the difference between football and ice hockey to explain Balanchine's signature style: Traditional ballet relies on the dancers' visible preparations for steps during a performance. This is like football, with players taking stances at the line of scrimmage before the ball is snapped. By contrast, ice hockey has players moving all the time. This is comparable to the flow in Balanchine's ballets, which eliminated the old preparations.
Mr. McDonagh had grown up a sports fan, particularly of the Yankees. He would sometimes walk to Yankee Stadium in the Bronx from his home in Morningside Heights in Upper Manhattan.
Donald Francis McDonagh was born in the Bronx on Feb. 6, 1932, and moved to Morningside Heights with his family as a child. His parents, Francis and Winifred (Tierney) McDonagh, had immigrated separately from Ireland before marrying. They opened the Moylan Tavern, a popular restaurant and bar, now long-vanished, near Columbia University.
The tavern's convivial atmosphere was recalled by the comedian and actor George Carlin in his mid-1990s television sitcom, "The George Carlin Show," in which he played a taxi driver. Most of its scenes were set inside a bar, also named the Moylan Tavern, which he had known while growing up in Morningside Heights.
Mr. McDonagh dedicated his book "How to Enjoy Ballet" (1978) to his parents.
After graduating from Fordham University, he did a stint in the Army during the Korean War and was posted to England. There he met Jennifer Jane Tobutt, a young British theatergoer who was part of a group that frequented London music halls and the ballet. They soon included Mr. McDonagh in their dancegoing. After Mr. McDonagh returned to New York, he and Ms. Tobutt were married. They were later divorced.
His second wife, Leslie Getz, a publisher of dance bibliographies, died in January.
Mr. McDonagh was managing editor of the quarterly Ballet Review from 1969 to 1995.
His other books include "The Complete Guide to Modern Dance" (1976), an introduction to the art form, and "The Rise and Fall and Rise of Modern Dance" (1970), in which he offered a sophisticated view of the 1960s avant-garde. His book "Martha Graham: A Biography" was published in 1973.
He is survived by four daughters from his first marriage, Maitland McDonagh, Ruth Stone, Rachel Chelius and Amy Monegro, and seven grandchildren.

To the Editor:
Re "Santa's Workshop Is a Big Eco-Mess" (Thursday Styles, Dec. 19):
Thank you for pointing out the ecological downside of the holidays, especially wrapping paper. According to Sundale Research, Americans spent about $ 8 billion last year on wrapping paper. Not only is that a lot of waste for our landfills, but it's also an expensive habit for something that gets ripped open in seconds.
It has been estimated that if every family wrapped just three presents in reused materials, it would save enough paper to cover 45,000 football fields. It doesn't have to be ugly brown paper either. Personally, I've found the switch quite easy using colorful special sections of The New York Times!

Texto completo: HONOLULU (AP) — Baba Ram Dass, the 1960s counterculture spiritual leader who experimented with LSD and traveled to India to find enlightenment, returning to share it with Americans, has died. He was 88.
Dass’ foundation, Love Serve Remember, announced late Sunday that the author and spiritual leader died peacefully at his home earlier in the day. No cause of death was given.
He had suffered a severe stroke in 1997 that left him paralyzed on the right side and, for a time, unable to speak. More recently, he underwent hip surgery after he was injured in a fall in November 2008, according to his website.
“I had really thought about checking out, but your love and your prayers convinced me not to do it. ... It’s just beautiful,” he told followers in a videotaped message at the time from his hospital bed in Hawaii.
Over the years, Ram Dass — born Richard Alpert — associated with the likes of Timothy Leary and Allen Ginsberg. He wrote about his experiences with drugs, set up projects to help prisoners and those facing terminal illness and sought to enlighten others about the universal struggle with aging.
But he was best known for the 1971 book Be Here Now, written after his trip to India. The spiritual primer found its way into thousands of backpacks around the world.
“I want to share with you the parts of the internal journey that never get written up in the mass media,” he wrote. “I’m not interested in what you read in the Saturday Evening Post about LSD. This is the story of what goes on inside a human being who is undergoing all these experiences.”
Among his other books were How Can I Help? and Compassion in Action and Still Here: Embracing Aging, Changing, and Dying.
“In the ‘60s, I was an uncle for a movement,” he told The Associated Press in 1998. “I was always showing people where they could go. I went east, and then there was a big movement east.”
Now, he said, “the baby boomers are getting old — and I’m learning how to get old for them. That’s my role.”
The Boston-born son of a prominent attorney, Ram Dass entered the public sphere in the early 1960s as a young Harvard psychology professor. Alpert, as he was then known, earned a doctorate at Stanford University.
He and Leary, a Harvard colleague, began a series of experiments with hallucinogenic mushrooms and LSD, giving the drugs to prisoners, philosophers and students to study their effects.

The experiments got him and Leary kicked out of Harvard in 1963. He and Leary retreated to an upstate New York mansion that drew Beat Generation figures Ginsberg, William Burroughs and Jack Kerouac. By the late 1960s, LSD and other hallucinogens had become part of pop culture and a rite of passage for many young Americans. But Alpert eventually sought a way to reach a state of enlightenment without drugs. Following Ginsberg’s advice, he headed to India in 1967, where he met the man who became his guru, Neem Karoli Baba.
There, his guru introduced him to yoga, meditation, Buddhism and Sufism, and gave him the name Ram Dass, Hindi for “servant of God.”
Ram Dass wrote Be Here Now when he returned to the United States. Around the same time, he told The New York Times that he had turned away from drugs, saying: “I don’t want to break the law, since that leads to fear and paranoia.”
In 1974, Ram Dass founded the Hanuman Foundation, which set up programs such as the Prison Ashram Project to introduce inmates to spirituality. He also helped create the Seva Foundation, which works to prevent blindness and helps community groups in developing countries. His Love Serve Remember Foundation is dedication to preserving his teachings and those of Neem Karoli Baba.
Ram Dass lived for many years in the quiet town of San Anselmo, Calif., about 20 miles north of San Francisco, surrounded by the markers of his life straddling East and West: Japanese prints and statues of Buddha, seashells from the South Pacific and a well-used player piano.
In later years, he moved to Woodside, Calif. More recently, he was based in Maui.
He said his 1997 stroke brought physical and spiritual suffering, but that he came to see the suffering as a source of insight that he could share with others facing their own battles with illness and aging.
“It’s brought out new aspects of myself and aspects of my relationship to the world,” he said in 1998. The stroke has gotten me into a stage of life — this is a stage close to death, a stage which is inward.”
After regaining his speech, Ram Dass returned to the lecture circuit, starting by touring Northern California sharing tales of what he called his state of “heavy grace.”
“All illnesses are part of the passing show,” he told the San Francisco Chronicle in 2004. “You are not just your body. You are the witness of your body.”
He had a falling out with Leary in the 1970s after rumors surfaced that the latter, jailed on drug and prison-break charges, offered to provide authorities with information on others involved in the drug culture in exchange for a lighter sentence.
But the pair had reconciled in the years before Leary’s death in 1996, joking back and forth and praising one another as they made joint appearances at lectures. When Leary was on his deathbed, Ram Dass came to visit after Leary asked for advice on how best to let go of life.
“The mythic level that Timothy and I lived at was that we were adventurers,” he said in the 2014 documentary, “Dying to Know: Ram Dass & Timothy Leary.”
Although speaking of Leary, Ram Dass added an epithet that also could be his own: “If you have identified with your soul when you are alive, death is just another moment.”

Texto completo: The House oversight panel on Monday asked immigration officials to explain how migrants continue to die in homeland security's custody.
WASHINGTON -- House Democrats demanded documents from the Department of Homeland Security on Monday to investigate a "troubling pattern of abuse and poor treatment" of migrants, after the death of a 16-year-old Guatemalan detainee and other new revelations.
In letters sent to immigration and homeland security officials, the House Oversight and Reform Committee demanded to know how a teenage detainee, who had the flu and a 103-degree fever, could have been sent to a holding cell where he lay still next to a toilet for four hours, only to be discovered dead by his teenage cellmate.
Representative Carolyn B. Maloney of New York, the chairwoman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, also questioned the shifting explanations from Customs and Border Protection, a division of the Department of Homeland Security. Officials initially said agents discovered the body of the teenager, Carlos Gregorio Hernandez Vasquez, during a welfare check. But surveillance video and additional documents, first obtained by ProPublica, revealed that to be untrue.
Customs and Border Protection officials also have yet to explain why they disregarded the recommendation of a nurse practitioner who asked that Mr. Hernandez Vasquez be re-evaluated and hospitalized if his condition worsened. Instead, he was left in his cell, where video showed him vomit before collapsing and lying motionless while his cellmate -- also sick -- slept under a foil blanket.
"The lack of treatment appears to be a flagrant violation of C.B.P.'s own detention standards and raises serious questions about whether D.H.S. is failing to treat children and adults with basic human dignity and compassion," Ms. Maloney said in the letter to Chad F. Wolf, the acting secretary of homeland security.
Officials with the Department of Homeland Security and Customs and Border Protection did not respond to requests for comment.
Mr. Hernandez Vazquez was held in Customs and Border Protection custody for six days before his death, despite a policy that requires detainees to be held in such facilities for no more than 72 hours. The agency has argued it had to hold detainees for extended periods because shelters intended to hold children for longer periods were full and the Department of Homeland Security's resources overall were exhausted.
Mr. Hernandez Vazquez entered the United States in May, during the busiest month in more than a decade, when more than 144,116 people were arrested at the southwestern border. Days later, he became the sixth migrant child to die in federal custody since President Trump took office.
An examination by The New York Times this year showed that years of warnings from both inside and outside the government on the protocols to assess the health of migrants have been largely ignored. Border Patrol agents and others who visited a facility in Clint, Texas, described crying children as well as cases of chickenpox, scabies and shingles among migrants, who often lacked diapers, toothpaste or soap.
Kevin K. McAleenan, then the acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, was pressed about the poor conditions in July by the House oversight panel, which has been investigating the agency for months.
"None of us would have our children in that position," said Representative Elijah E. Cummings, the chairman of the committee who has since died. "They are human beings."
Customs and Border Protection does not provide flu vaccinations to migrants, arguing that the vulnerable population is supposed to be in its custody for only short periods of time. It has instead expanded its medical programs, with more than 250 medical officials working along the border.
The Democrats also demanded on Monday information from Immigration and Customs Enforcement on medical treatment provided to migrants after a newly revealed internal complaint said the agency had "systematically provided inadequate medical and mental health care and oversight to immigration detainees in facilities throughout the U.S."
In a Department of Homeland Security memo, first obtained by BuzzFeed News, an agency whistle-blower said three people had died in ICE custody after receiving inadequate care. The official also said that an 8-year-old boy lost part of his forehead because of a delayed diagnosis and a man was prescribed the wrong medicine, resulting in him coughing up blood and being hospitalized.
On the same day the congressional committee demanded the documents, ICE said a Nigerian detainee was found dead on Saturday morning from apparent "self-inflicted strangulation." Anthony Oluseye Akinyemi, 56, had been moved into ICE custody on Dec. 20 after being convicted of a sex offense and assault, according to the statement from ICE. He was in custody for less than 24 hours before his death.
April Grant, a spokeswoman for ICE, declined to comment, citing an agency policy to respond to congressional correspondence through official channels.

Pot, psychosis link real, doctors warn

Texto completo: Early one morning in March, Madison McIntosh showed up on his day off at the Scottsdale, Arizona, driving range and restaurant where he worked. The 24-year-old sat in his car until the place opened, then wandered around all day, alternating between gibberish and talk of suicide as co-workers tried to keep him away from customers.
When he was still there 12 hours later, the manager contacted McIntosh's father in Las Vegas, who called police and rallied family members states away to converge at the young man's side.
They found a shell of the former star baseball player. For months, he had been vaping a potent form of THC, the ingredient in marijuana that makes people feel high, and staying up all night. He swung wildly between depression and euphoria.
The family rushed McIntosh to Banner Behavioral Health Hospital, where staff psychiatrist Divya Jot Singh diagnosed him with cannabis use disorder and a "psychotic disorder unspecified."
Singh expects to make McIntosh's diagnosis official soon.
If he remains off pot and symptom-free a year after the episode, the psychiatrist can say with certainty he suffered from "cannabis-induced psychosis."
"What shocked me is that I had never heard of it," said McIntosh's dad, Rob. "All you hear is all these proponents of legalization of pot without thought to the risks and the consequences."
A number of physicians and parents are pushing back against the long-held assertion of users and advocates that marijuana is a safe, benign and even beneficial drug.
Those sounding the alarm include the nation's "mental health czar," as well as doctors in Colorado, California and Massachusetts where marijuana is legal for recreational use.
They say the facts are irrefutable: Excessive use of high-THC pot and concentrated oil is linked to psychotic episodes that in some cases develop into full-blown schizophrenia.
There is great disagreement over the strength of the science linking pot and psychosis. Advocates on either side of the marijuana debate have different interpretations of the connection reported in a National Academies cannabis study in 2017 and other studies. In March, The Lancet, a British medical journal, reported a two to five times higher risk of psychotic disorders for daily consumers of high-THC marijuana compared with people who never used.
Arguments surround how much of the illness is preceded or worsened by the drug use, how often marijuana is used in response to it and whether the psychosis would have occurred anyway.
"At the end of the day, you can't make a causal statement," said Ziva Cooper, research director of the UCLA Cannabis Research Initiative and a member of the National Academies panel. "You need to have some biological premise to show that this kind of exposure causes psychotic disorder."
The federal government and other health officials say the type of psychosis McIntosh experienced and other psychiatric disorders are clearly tied to the drug.
"It is time for Americans to understand there are substantial risks with marijuana," said Elinore McCance-Katz, the Department of Health and Human Services' top mental health official. "This is not the government making up data."
'Settled science' McCance-Katz pointed out that hospitalizations more than doubled for serious mental health disorders among 18- to 25-year-olds nationally from 2012 to 2018. She cited a study in July that shows a 77% increase in suicide deaths from 2010 to 2015 among Colorado 10- to 19-year-olds with marijuana in their systems.
Among people who use marijuana, 10% to 20% will develop a marijuana use disorder and "be at risk for these other kinds of mental and physical adverse events," she said.
"That's not the majority, that's the minority of people who use marijuana, but here's the problem: We don't know who they are a priori (in advance)," McCance-Katz said. "We do not want to exaggerate the risks."
Many marijuana users and industry officials say that's precisely what the Trump administration is doing.
They pointed to other studies, including one by Columbia University professors in the journal Drug and Alcohol Dependence that showed cannabis use disorder dropped significantly across all ages reporting daily or almost-daily cannabis use from 2002-2016.
Longtime marijuana legalization advocate Mason Tvert said millions of Americans are rightly skeptical about warnings of the dangers of cannabis use, given it's the most widely used illicit substance in the country.
"When people claim that smoking a joint will lead to psychosis, many consumers are going to write that off, and as a result are going to write off other warnings," said Tvert, who led Colorado's first-in-the-nation cannabis legalization effort in 2012 and works for Denver-based VS Strategies.
Die-hard marijuana advocates strongly push back against news reports that suggest cannabis might have made someone sick, often criticizing such coverage as hearkening back to the days of "Reefer Madness," the 1936 film that purported to show the drug's dangers.
When Surgeon General Jerome Adams included the link between cannabis and psychosis in his advisory in August on marijuana's effect on the "developing brain," he was trashed and threatened on Twitter.
Alex Berenson, a former New York Times business reporter who wrote the book "Tell Your Children: The Truth about Marijuana, Mental Illness and Violence," was widely condemned for his warnings of the drug's dangers.
Tvert said legalization advocates want research conducted without bias or political motivation. It's an area, he said, where the federal government has little credibility.
"That's what happened for decades," he said. "The federal government spread misinformation and exaggerated the risks so much that people just started ignoring all the warnings."
McCance-Katz said it was not a difficult decision at HHS to include the link between marijuana and psychosis in the surgeon general's advisory.
"This has been settled science," she said. "This is something that has been known for many years, yet there has been virtually no attention paid to it."

Texto completo: Evangelicals continue to support Trump in overwhelming numbers.
Thursday night, Christianity Today, long known as the "flagship" magazine of American evangelicalism, broke the internet with an editorial arguing for the impeachment and removal of Donald Trump from office. The piece, penned by the magazine's outgoing editor, Mark Galli, implored evangelicals to consider the "unambiguous facts" of the impeachment case against the president, maintaining his actions not only violated the Constitution, but were also "profoundly immoral."
The reaction -- particularly from non-evangelicals -- was excited and swift. "Whoa" and "big deal" led links to the piece on Twitter, suggesting that, after Mr. Trump spent four wildly successful years consolidating the support of white evangelicals, the magazine's lofty stand would finally trigger a fatal exodus by this crucial demographic. The magazine's website, apparently buckling under the unusual spate of traffic, was down for part of the evening, but that did not stop the avalanche of coverage on television, news sites and social media. "This is mainstream evangelical Christianity leadership," remarked CNN's Wolf Blitzer, reading segments of the "amazing" editorial on the air.
For many outsiders, Christianity Today seems to speak for millions of evangelicals. After all, the magazine was founded by Billy Graham, the pastor to presidents since Eisenhower. A pro-impeachment editorial would appear to be a game-changer -- undermining the seemingly unmovable support for the president among white evangelicals.
That assumption, though, profoundly misapprehends American evangelicalism in the Trump era.
Since his 2016 election, in which 81 percent of white evangelicals voted for him, Mr. Trump continues to enjoy their unwavering loyalty. Three-quarters of white evangelicals approve of his job performance, and 80 percent of them remain opposed to impeaching him.
While many conservative evangelicals respect Christianity Today, it is read by a small slice of them, and is unlikely to make any significant dent in the president's remarkable popularity. As even Mr. Galli conceded to The Atlantic's Emma Green, "We speak for moderate, center-right, and center-left evangelicals. The far right -- they don't read us."
The "far right" to which Mr. Galli referred is actually the dominant force in American evangelicalism, and it is stubbornly in Mr. Trump's corner. It did not take long after the editorial was published for the president's staunchest evangelical defenders, including Billy Graham's son, Franklin, to react.
Writing on Facebook, Mr. Graham reproached the magazine for invoking his father's name to support its position, maintaining that his father, who died in 2018, had supported Mr. Trump as "the man for this hour in history for our nation." He even accused the magazine of being "used by the left for their political agenda," and representing "the elitist liberal wing of evangelicalism" -- a smear taken up, not surprisingly, by the president himself in a tweet.
As I reported the same day the editorial was published, Mr. Trump's evangelical supporters have built a powerful network of political organizations, prayer warriors, televangelists, religious media, mega-churches and voter identification and mobilization efforts -- a sprawling spiritual army with multifaceted battalions -- that is defending him in the face of impeachment.
In this insular ecosystem, the president is seen as a divinely anointed leader, sent by God to save America at a critical moment in history, when, supporters claim, their religious freedom is under attack by secularists. For these evangelicals, the facts that Mr. Galli pleaded with them to assess are "fake news" planted by "deep state," and even satanic enemies of the anointed president.
Mr. Trump's evangelical followers believe he will prevail because their prayers will vanquish the work of his enemies. In a recent conference call for the One Voice Prayer Movement, formed specifically to mobilize prayer warriors for the president, the televangelist Paula White, a top adviser to the White House Faith and Opportunities Initiative, prayed that "any persons, entities, that are aligned against the president" be "exposed and dealt with and overturned by the superior blood of Jesus."
But Mr. Trump's support is not just about anointings and prayers. It is also about personnel, policy and law -- in other words, a government led by Christians who will undo, for example, advances in L.G.B.T.Q. rights. The Christian right enjoys not just regular and frequent access to the president, but virtual carte blanche on dictating policy, as top ideologues have been placed in cabinet positions and other political appointments in federal agencies.
Ralph Reed, a leading evangelical activist and supporter of Mr. Trump, has boasted to his followers, "There are more Christians serving" in the Trump administration "than all previous presidents combined."
Mr. Trump's evangelical defenders may truly believe he is anointed, or they may just relish the unparalleled authority he has granted them. Either way, this actual mainstream of American evangelicalism is not likely to give up on its divine leader, or on its newfound power, no matter what the impeachment proceedings uncover.

Texto completo: When George W. Bush lost the popular vote to Al Gore in 2000 but became president anyway, he did so with almost 50.5 million votes. I didn’t know that number until I looked it up, because it would have been unimaginable for that president — even though he could be quite demagogic — to brandish it as proof that he represented some quasi-mystical conception of “the people,” in contrast to the nearly 51 million citizens who voted for his opponent.
Anyone who pays attention to politics, however, knows that Donald Trump got around 63 million votes in 2016. That number has taken on a totemic significance for him and his supporters; any attempts to restrain his power are seen as a sin against the 63 million. During the long impeachment debate in the House on Wednesday, Rep. Bill Johnson, R-Ohio, called for a moment of silence to “remember the voices of the 63 million American voters” whose will Democrats would defy, as if seeing Trump held to constitutional standards was a sort of death.
On the surface it seems strange, this constant trumpeting of a vote total that is more than 2 million less than the total received by Trump’s opponent, Hillary Clinton. Trump didn’t just lose the popular vote — he lost it by a greater margin than any successful presidential candidate in American history. The right’s bombastic repetition of Trump’s 63 million could be just a propaganda trick meant to bully America’s anti-Trump majority into seeing itself as marginal, despite the more than 65 million votes Clinton received. But as I watched impeachment unfold, it seemed like something more than that — an assertion of whom Republicans think this country belongs to.
Over the last three years, a political narrative has developed that Republicans in Congress secretly dislike Trump but overlook his personal degeneracy in the interest of enacting their agenda. Wednesday should explode that fiction forever.
The Republican identification with Trump is total. Again and again, histrionic Republican congressmen equated hatred of the president with hatred of themselves and hatred of the sacred 63 million. They spoke of Trump with an awe and a maudlin devotion bordering on religious; Rep. Barry Loudermilk, R-Ga., declared that Trump had been given less due process than Jesus Christ himself.
If Trump is a martyr, who are his persecutors? You could watch the debate with the sound off and understand. All day, Republican speeches delivered by old white men alternated with Democratic speeches from women, people of color and young people. White men make up 90% of the Republican caucus and 38% of the Democratic one, and the day dramatized the representational gulf in the starkest visual terms.
With the sound on, you could hear fury and self-pity from the Republicans, along with, at times, outrage that Democrats would have the audacity to speak on behalf of American values. Rep. Clay Higgins, R-La., brought with him one of those color-coded maps Trump supporters love, showing how their fewer 2016 votes were spread over much greater expanses of land. “We’re not being devoured from within because of some surreal assertion of the socialists’ newfound love for the very flag that they trod upon,” Higgins said. “We face this horror because of this map.”
In a sense, he’s right: We face the horror of Trump because the structure of American democracy gives disproportionate power to a declining demographic group passionately convinced of its right to rule. Trump, with his braying entitlement, his boastful ignorance, his sneering contempt for pluralism, is an avatar of a Republican Party desperate to return to the 1980s, or the 1950s, or maybe the 1910s. He can’t betray America if, to those who fetishize the 63 million, he embodies it.
At the start of this administration, many who are horrified by Trump, me included, thought that at some point the Republican fever might break, leading conservatives in Congress to check a dictator-worshiping buffoon for the sake of the Constitution they claim to revere. I’ve become ashamed of my naïveté in imagining any overlap between my ideas about what is valuable in this country, and theirs.
“There’s been a lot of talk about the 63 million people who voted for Mr. Trump,” the House majority leader, Steny Hoyer, said in his surprisingly moving speech on Wednesday. “Little talk about the 65 million people who voted for Hillary Clinton.” With the House’s impeachment vote, the America outside of Trump’s ruling faction finally mattered.
I don’t mean that impeachment was revenge on a minority president made possible only by a brute majority in one chamber of Congress. Before the Ukraine scandal broke, I had harangued leading Democrats to impeach Trump for obstructing the Mueller investigation, for his flagrant violations of the Constitution’s emoluments clause, and for cheating in his 2016 election by committing campaign finance crimes, and I’d been repeatedly frustrated by their extreme reluctance. Democrats didn’t want to impeach, but once they decided to, Trump’s insistence that his Electoral College victory grants him impunity didn’t work. For one night, democracy asserted itself.
Much has been made of the fact that the articles of impeachment received no Republican votes; the one conservative who backed them, the former Freedom Caucus member Justin Amash, left the party to become an independent. But there are hardly any moderate Republicans left who might have been open to impeachment because voters in 2018 replaced most of them with Democrats. In the end, Trump’s impeachment passed with more House votes than Bill Clinton’s. All but one of the Democrats first elected in last year’s blue wave voted for impeachment, some at real political risk, given the conservative lean of their districts.
“Today, especially today, I reflect on the founding documents that have set us apart in the world, leading people across generations and across the world to risk everything because of their belief in our great nation,” said the Virginia Democrat Abigail Spanberger, a Constitution scarf around her neck, her voice charged with emotion.
Women and people of color, of course, were originally outside the protection of those founding documents. But on Wednesday, the most diverse Congress in history declared that even the most powerful white man in the world should be bound by them. When Republicans act as if that’s a sacrilege, they show us what they worship.

Texto completo: In 1924, the U.K.-based newspaper The Tamworth Herald warned of a dangerous craze that had "enslaved" the United States.
The paper described a "menace ... making devastating inroads on the working hours of every rank of society." People were "shamelessly" participating at all hours of the day. It was dealing "the final blow to the art of conversation."
The culprit? Crossword puzzles.
Yep, crossword puzzles, those grids of black-and-white blocks and often pun-ny clues that appear in the pages of newspapers. They were all the rage in the 1920s, until the nationwide fad eventually died along with the Charleston and pole sitting.
Nearly a century later and we're in the "golden age of crosswords." Or so says Will Shortz. He should know: Shortz has been the editor of the storied New York Times crossword puzzle since 1993, and before that worked at Games magazine for 15 years.
"They have never been as popular, with the possible exception of 1924," Shortz, who lives in Pleasantville, in Westchester County, New York, told NorthJersey.com. "Now crosswords are more up to date, they're livelier, they feel more modern. I think they're attracting a wider audience than ever."
'A good kind of torture' Once upon a time crossword fans had to rely on newspapers, magazines or published puzzle books to get their fix. Now you can solve on your tablet or phone via apps, or subscription-based sites like The Inkubator and Fireball Crosswords can send them to your inbox. You can sign up for Queer Crosswords or Women of Letters by donating to specific charities.
"Now there are so many other options and venues," said Anna Gundlach, a puzzle fan and crossword constructor who lives in Portland, Oregon. "A lot of the distribution channels are able to be bypassed entirely."
The proliferation of independent crossword puzzles means a wider range of clues and answers and more provocative content. Puzzle editors at the New York Times reject puzzles if they decide a clue or answer is too obscure. Gundlach said the paper passed on one of hers because it referenced Bell Biv DeVoe.
"The American Values Club, which I've done a crossword for recently, has a more Gen X, millennial bent to it," she said. "Fresher clues, not afraid to swear or talk about sex."
Gundlach has had a nearly lifelong puzzle obsession. For Howard Barkin, a love of crosswords came late. He started solving them in his early 30s during lunch breaks to get his mind off work. Now he's 45 and a legit crossword puzzle champion. Barkin, who lives in Somerset County, New Jersey, finished first place in the 2016 American Crossword Puzzle Tournament in Stamford, Connecticut.
Shortz is the director for the contest, which pits the best crossword solvers against one another in seven games over the course of a weekend, culminating in a final round for the three finalists. Barkin's tournament victory came after solving the last puzzle in seven minutes and 49 seconds.
The stress level was high, Barkin said.
"Most people aren't used to solving a crossword with a timer counting down in a room full of 500 people," he said.
Barkin also constructs crosswords when he frees up time between doing dishes and raising two young daughters. He said his favorite to solve involve "extremely evil" tricks.
"A puzzle that breaks the rules, but for a good reason," he said. "A puzzle where you have to write a Greek letter into a square or something. It's a good kind of torture."
'Wow us' Even with a host of alternatives, the gold standard crossword remains the one The New York Times publishes.
"It's capital T, capital C: The Crossword," Gundlach said. "When people talk about 'the Sunday crossword' or 'the Friday crossword,' that's generally assumed to be the New York Times crossword."
Crossword fans use the hashtag #NYTXW on Twitter to brag about their finish times and offer their often-harsh criticism of that day's puzzle. The Dec. 12 crossword elicited reviews like "Ugh. So Bible heavy and then that twist? No." and "Ok #NYTXW sorry I don't know the ATOMIC NUMBER of NEODYMIUM?!?!"
The paper's associate puzzles editor, Sam Ezersky, doesn't take that kind of criticism personally. His Facebook banner photo is a foul-mouthed pan of one of his crossword puzzles.
"It's an obsessive culture," Ezersky said. "I get being so passionate about something like this."
Ezersky grew up in a D.C. suburb as a puzzles fanatic and sold his first crossword puzzle to the Los Angeles Times when he was 16 years old. He's 24 now, lives in Hoboken and spends his days sifting through some of the roughly 600 crossword puzzle submissions the New York Times receives monthly (via snail mail only). Some he turns down with nothing more than a glance. Either the grid is an odd pattern, or the words are meh.
"We're just looking for fresh things that really capture our attention," he said. "These days we really need the puzzles to wow us."
Ezersky does not construct puzzles as much as he used to, but he snagged a dream assignment this year, creating the annual "super mega" crossword that ran Sunday in the New York Times' special puzzles section. It was a massive undertaking: a 50x50-square grid with 708 answers. It's so big the clues are printed on a separate page. Ezersky estimates it took hundreds of hours to construct. Still, he would have begged to do it if necessary.
"I know there were other constructors that declined because it's a such a Herculean task," he said. "If I could have been totally no filter and not cared about professionality, I would have been like, 'Please please please please please.'"
An Ezersky crossword from August shows how his mind works when he puzzles out a puzzle. He began with the across answer at the bottom left, where he placed "tech savvy." He then stacked "heist film" right on top, giving himself the unenviable challenge of finding a down answer that ends with "lv." He did: "capital V."
Once the grid is done, he dreams up clues. He clued "tech savvy" with "E-sharp?" — that question mark is crossword-ese indicating there's a joke or pun involved — and asked readers to get to "capital V" with the clue "Symbol for 54-down." The answer there was "volts."
Constructing crossword puzzles can be agonizing, Ezersky said, but he wouldn't want any other job.
"My mantra to myself is I'm just getting started," he said. "I'm just humbled and grateful to be doing what I'm doing."

Texto completo: One thing Rajon Lynch is unable to escape? His ties to Harry Houdini.
Not that he'd want to.
The 23-year-old magician who in recent years performed around the Appleton area, including at the History Museum at the Castle and Houdini's Escape Gastropub, has found a new job in a new city. He's now the director of the Houdini Museum of New York.
His ties to Appleton — the onetime home of Houdini, history's most famous magician — didn't land him the job. But it certainly didn't hurt.
"I think it definitely piqued his interest," Lynch said of the museum's owner, Roger Dreyer, who hired him in September. "Being from Appleton, when I started getting in the papers and stuff, the main thing was Houdini was old and Appleton might be looking to revive magic. Because I started writing about that stuff, I felt like I had a good grasp in terms of what people want from magic."
Houdini famously claimed to be a native of Appleton, though he came here as a child from Budapest, Hungary and left well before finding fame. Lynch, who performs as RJ the Magician, is a native of Racine who came to this area for college — he earned a communications degree from University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh in the spring — and often performed in Appleton while in school.
In 2017, he launched a dinner-show program called Now Serving Magic, which was hosted at times by Houdini's Escape, the History Museum and Oshkosh's Time Community Theater.
He spent the summer after graduation teaching magic in China. That's where he was when he was first contacted about the opening at the Houdini Museum, which is found in the same city Houdini now rests. The great illusionist is buried in a cemetery in Queens.
Opened in 2012, the museum itself is a small, a one-room showcase on the fourth floor of a Midtown Manhattan building, but it houses more than $3 million in memorabilia. With cuffs, posters, keys, a coffin and a trunk from the famous "Metamorphasis" stunt, it's the largest public collection of Houdini items.
One of the goals of the Houdini Museum, according to the official website, is to "inspire all age groups to realize once you focus and set your mind on something, you can accomplish anything you desire." It's fitting, then, that shortly before Now Serving Magic was starting in Wisconsin, Lynch told The Post-Crescent his plans after college were simple: "I want to be in New York," he said.
The operation also includes the Fantasma Magic Shop, which Lynch now oversees. He said they often sell magic kits to kids, and he joked he sometimes feels like "black Santa."
"You don't see magic shops around anymore," said Lynch, who owned a Fantasma kit as a child. "When my parents were younger, like every neighborhood (in New York) had a magic shop where you could go and learn some tricks. Now it's all converted to online."
Besides peddling magic wares, the duties he took on in September include giving tours, producing magic shows, performing and chatting up the guests.
He also helps market the museum, something he's already getting the hang of. In his few short months he's been covered by New York's ABC, NBC and Fox affiliates, AM New York and the New York Times. (And now, of course, The Post-Crescent.)
As a young, black magician with a background linked with Houdini, he knows he has a story hook.
"I was able to learn that I kind of had a knack for writing, especially about magic," he said. "And that's probably why I got this job, because I love magic, I love people and I love making connections like that."
RJ the Magician returns Rajon Lynch, aka RJ the Magician, will be back in northeast Wisconsin for a performance with two other magicians. The event is at 7:30 p.m. Jan. 24 at Tim Community Theater, 445 N. Main St., Oshkosh. RJ will perform with Caleb Hyatt and Noah Sonie. Hyatt is based in Milwaukee and Sonie is from Minnesota. Tickets start at $15 and are available at eventbrite.com.

Texto completo: A Louisville Male High School teacher is under investigation weeks after being suspended for mocking and disparaging students.
Jeffrey Wright was suspended without pay for five days in early September after a school investigation found he made "inappropriate, harassing and bullying comments towards and about students" during the 2018-19 school year, according to a letter in his personnel file.
Wright, a science teacher, also made "inappropriate comments regarding LGBTQ students" and "used sexual innuendo" in his classroom, the letter continues.
He returned to Male after the suspension but was reassigned to a noninstructional role last week amid a new investigation, district spokeswoman Renee Murphy said.
Murphy declined to say why Wright is under review.
Wright did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But his supporters have circulated a petition to keep him.
"He's inspired generations of students, and as long as he gets a chance to be in a classroom he will continue to do so as long as he lives," said Zach Badgett, an 18-year-old senior who had Wright as a teacher last year.
During his two decades in the classroom, Wright gained state and national attention. In 2006, he was named Kentucky's Teacher of the Year.
In 2012, a New York Times piece centered on Wright and his son Adam, who has a rare disease called Joubert syndrome.
The online petition supporting Wright popped up a week ago. More than 3,800 people, including many former students, have signed it.
"Mr. Wright deserves to stay," the petition's creator, Larisa Matanovic, wrote in the petition's introduction.
"He will stand with you," Matanovic wrote. "We should stand with him, too."
Badgett agreed.
"The impact that Mr. Wright has made throughout his time at Male will last forever. The lessons he's taught us that travel far beyond school will never be forgotten," he said. "Each and every student who has stepped foot in his classroom has left Male a different person because of him."
It isn't clear why Wright was most recently pulled from the classroom. His personnel file, obtained under the state open records law, does not have any documents since his suspension letter from late August.
His suspension letter details past trends of inappropriate comments, which Superintendent Marty Pollio wrote violated ethical standards.
According to an evaluation, the school appears to have begun investigating Wright after a parent accused the teacher of "slandering her son."
Other students confirmed Wright "continually singled out that particular student" by making negative comments about him, according to the evaluation.
The student said being in Wright's room was "a toxic environment" for him.
Wright, in the summary of the meeting, said he only questioned why the student was out of the room for "a long length of time."
Student statements also alleged Wright made "inappropriate" remarks about LGBTQ students and sexual comments.
In response to the LGBTQ allegation, which was not detailed in the summary, Wright said he wasn't sure why this student would accuse him of that "because the student invited him to his graduation party."
Wright unbuttoned and unzipped his pants in front of a classroom of students, according to one event detailed in the file.
He then pulled his shirttail through the hole to "prove a point about the dress code," Pollio wrote in the suspension letter.
In a June meeting about the allegations, Wright confirmed he did so to "illustrate that students could dress any way they wanted due to changes in dress code," a write-up of the meeting said.
Asked if he gave students "sexual tips" to remember physics content, Wright said he gave students "creative ways" to remember things. Some kids inferred sexual innuendos, he continued.
"You are not to disparage or mock students," Pollio wrote in Wright's suspension letter months later.
Wright has been reassigned to JCPS' materials production department pending the investigation.

Texto completo: One thing Rajon Lynch is unable to escape? His ties to Harry Houdini.
Not that he'd want to.
The 23-year-old magician who in recent years performed around the Appleton area, including at the History Museum at the Castle and Houdini's Escape Gastropub, has found a new job in a new city. He's now the director of the Houdini Museum of New York.
His ties to Appleton — the onetime home of Houdini, history's most famous magician — didn't land him the job. But it certainly didn't hurt.
"I think it definitely piqued his interest," Lynch said of the museum's owner, Roger Dreyer, who hired him in September. "Being from Appleton, when I started getting in the papers and stuff, the main thing was Houdini was old and Appleton might be looking to revive magic. Because I started writing about that stuff, I felt like I had a good grasp in terms of what people want from magic."
Houdini famously claimed to be a native of Appleton, though he came here as a child from Budapest, Hungary, and left well before finding fame. Lynch, who performs as RJ the Magician, is a native of Racine who came to this area for college — he earned a communications degree from University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh in the spring — and often performed in Appleton while in school.
In 2017, he launched a dinner-show program called Now Serving Magic, which was hosted at times by Houdini's Escape, the History Museum and Oshkosh's Time Community Theater.
He spent the summer after graduation teaching magic in China. That's where he was when he was first contacted about the opening at the Houdini Museum, which is found in the same city Houdini now rests. The great illusionist is buried in a cemetery in Queens.
Opened in 2012, the museum itself is a small, a one-room showcase on the fourth floor of a Midtown Manhattan building, but it houses more than $3 million in memorabilia. With cuffs, posters, keys, a coffin and a trunk from the famous "Metamorphasis" stunt, it's the largest public collection of Houdini items.
One of the goals of the Houdini Museum, according to the official website, is to "inspire all age groups to realize once you focus and set your mind on something, you can accomplish anything you desire." It's fitting, then, that shortly before Now Serving Magic was starting in Wisconsin, Lynch told The Post-Crescent his plans after college were simple: "I want to be in New York," he said.
The operation also includes the Fantasma Magic Shop, which Lynch now oversees. He said they often sell magic kits to kids, and he joked he sometimes feels like "black Santa."
"You don't see magic shops around anymore," said Lynch, who owned a Fantasma kit as a child. "When my parents were younger, like every neighborhood (in New York) had a magic shop where you could go and learn some tricks. Now it's all converted to online."
Besides peddling magic wares, the duties he took on in September include giving tours, producing magic shows, performing and chatting up the guests.
He also helps market the museum, something he's already getting the hang of. In his few short months he's been covered by New York's ABC, NBC and Fox affiliates, AM New York and the New York Times.

Shaped by the #metoo movement

Texto completo: As the cultural conversation about sexual harassment and assault crescendos, three 2019 books examining powerful men and their accusers demonstrate the divergent ways journalists have navigated this charged territory.
“She Said: Breaking the Sexual Harassment Story That Helped Ignite a Movement," “Catch and Kill: Lies, Spies, and a Conspiracy to Protect Predators," and “The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation" spring variously from newspaper, television, and magazine reporting, which they scrutinize and extend. In the process, they both chronicle and fuel the #MeToo reckoning that journalism, in concert with social media, has helped prompt.
These worthy volumes land at a stressful time for journalists and media companies, beset by financial and reputational challenges. Against the backdrop of politically motivated cries of “fake news," credibility issues loom large. So it's worth noting what these books suggest about journalistic techniques, standards, and what philosophers call epistemology, or how we know what we know. For journalists, the question is what kind of evidence suffices to bring contested, potentially criminal behavior to public attention.
“She Said," by the New York Times reporting team of Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, is a journalism procedural focused on their groundbreaking investigation of Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein's career of sexual predation. (The Times and the New Yorker, where Ronan Farrow's Weinstein stories appeared, shared the 2018 Pulitzer for Public Service.)
The book's title gestures at the epistemological problem of this type of reporting, encapsulated by the trope, “He said, she said." The expression indicates that contradictory verbal accounts of sexual misconduct can make factual determinations difficult. That notion is upended here, as the reporters unambiguously side with the (no longer merely “alleged") victims.
It helps that Kantor and Twohey rely not just on interviews, but on a paper trail of e-mail and legal settlements, battened down by (sometimes violated) nondisclosure agreements. For the book, they have convinced more sources, including Weinstein Company executives, to provide incriminating documents and go on the record, further buttressing the story.
Toggling between initially recalcitrant sources and patient but demanding editors, “She Said" evokes Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein's Watergate classic, “All the President's Men." Missing, though, are the dramatic personality contrasts that made the Woodward and Bernstein pairing so compelling.
Farrow's “Catch and Kill," while covering some of the same ground as “She Said," is a showier book — a nonfiction narrative composed like a spy thriller (with actual spies, including at least two whom Farrow turned). It already has spurred a spin-off podcast by Farrow and seems destined for a movie or miniseries adaptation.
In a complicated ju-jitsu, “Catch and Kill," even as it attests to the importance of journalism, adds weight to the assault against it. Farrow impugns not just the conduct but the motives of his onetime bosses at NBC News, painting them as alternately pusillanimous, misogynistic, and susceptible to external pressures to halt his Weinstein investigation. (They deny the charges, but have so far failed to authorize an independent probe.)
Like Twohey and Kantor, Farrow is a protagonist in the story, even if he tries his best to relegate the mantle of heroism to the women who confide in him. His personal stake is enhanced by his sister Dylan's sexual abuse accusations against their father, Woody Allen (which Farrow has supported and Allen denies).
The title, “Catch and Kill," is a reference to the tabloid journalism practice of paying potential news subjects for their stories, then burying them in service to some other agenda. In the book, the phrase becomes a shorthand for the ways in which a nefarious interlocking web of media, Hollywood, and political power brokers cover up the sexual (and other) misbehavior of their own. “That's not a conspiracy theory," Farrow said in a recent appearance at the Free Library of Philadelphia. “It's a real conspiracy."
Farrow also noted the contrast between the “raw human anguish" he witnessed in his interview subjects and the “very spare, almost clinical style" of his New Yorker articles. “Catch and Kill" is essentially Farrow unleashed, but with an important caveat: He notes that he “used the same standard of fact-checking" as the New Yorker, shoring up the reader's faith in even his most surprising revelations.
Both authors of “The Education of Brett Kavanaugh," have personal connections to the Kavanaugh story, as they make clear. Robin Pogrebin was a Yale classmate who lived in the same freshman dorm as the future US Supreme Court justice. Kate Kelly attended a Washington D.C. girls' high school whose social circles overlapped with Kavanaugh's alma mater, Georgetown Preparatory School.
Yet they strive to purge their writing of personality and subjectivity, presenting the dueling “he said, she said" narratives of Kavanaugh and his principal accusers, Christine Blasey Ford (who alleged a high school sexual assault) and Deborah Ramirez (who said Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at Yale), with dispassion. Their contributions include secondhand corroboration of Ramirez's account (potential eyewitnesses remained mum) and a vague story about another woman, Tracy Harmon Joyce, who might have had a similar experience at Yale.
An epilogue wrestles explicitly with the epistemological issues the Times reporters faced, evaluating their sometimes contradictory findings through the prisms of both journalism and common sense. They conclude “that Ford and Ramirez were mistreated by Kavanaugh as a teenager, and that Kavanaugh over the next thirty-five years became a better person." In the end, their investigation segues into a coming-of-age story, and their title, for all its ironic undertones, points to redemption.

Abbey Simon, 99, Dies; Pianist With a Pyrotechnic Style

Texto completo: Mr. Simon, light of touch yet breathtakingly pyrotechnic, was known for his interpretations of the Romantic literature.
Abbey Simon, an American pianist celebrated for a style that harked back to an earlier, golden age of keyboard prowess, died on Wednesday at his home in Geneva. He was 99.
His death was announced by his son, Jonathan.
Mr. Simon, who had appeared on concert stages around the world since the early 1940s, was often called a pianist's pianist -- greatly admired by musicians and critics if not strictly a household name. Known in particular for his interpretations of the Romantic literature, he was lauded for the fleetness of his fingers, the lightness of his tone and the thoughtfulness of his interpretations.
"Poetry, musicianship and technique have characterized Abbey Simon's piano playing since his debut nine years ago," Ross Parmenter wrote in The New York Times in 1949, reviewing a concert by Mr. Simon of Bach, Brahms, Chopin and Ravel. "On the basis of his recital last night at Carnegie Hall, one would add a fourth attribute, mastery."
Although some critics faulted Mr. Simon's playing for being overly cerebral, most concurred that in his pianism and choice of repertoire he recalled late-19th and early-20th-century virtuosos like Josef Hofmann, who had been his teacher. The style of both men was breathtakingly pyrotechnic yet no less sensitive for it -- in stark contrast to the more bombastic approach that came to be regarded as a hallmark of many younger pianists.
"I am in essence a 19th-century artist," Mr. Simon told the music journalist Bruce Duffie in 1988. "I play a great deal of Prokofiev; I play Sam Barber, but they're '19th-century' composers. They are virtuoso composers; they are melodic composers; they are fascinating in their harmonies and their orchestration. But the way present-day composers use the piano, it's just not for me."
Mr. Simon was widely heard on recordings; as a soloist with orchestras including the New York Philharmonic, the Chicago Symphony and the Philadelphia Orchestra; and, in particular, on recital stages, including those of Carnegie and Town Halls in New York.
"I was brought up in the great tradition of the piano recital," he told The Times in 1981. "Playing with an orchestra is an exciting experience, it's a chance to make an impression and all that. But when all is said and done, we're going to judge the artist not on the Rachmaninoff Third, or the Brahms D minor, or Beethoven's 'Emperor,' but on how he plays in recital."
The son of Solomon Simon, a dentist, and the former Vera Sheldin, Abbey Simon was born in New York on Jan. 8, 1920, and reared in the Bronx.
The family, teeming with doctors and dentists, was musical as well as medical: One uncle, besides being a dentist, was a semiprofessional jazz pianist; another, Mr. Simon recalled in a 2013 video interview, was "the Jascha Heifetz of the mandolin."
At 3, Abbey could pick out perfectly on the piano any tune he heard on the radio; he began formal lessons at 5.
"I was a very lucky child, because who knows what they want to be when they are only 3 years old?" Mr. Simon said in a 2014 interview with The Daily Cougar, the campus newspaper of the University of Houston, where he taught for many years. "I had always known I was a pianist."
At 10, he received a scholarship to Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia. Taking up the scholarship the next year, he moved to Philadelphia with his mother and studied there with Hofmann.
In 1940, Mr. Simon was a winner of the Walter W. Naumburg Foundation competition, a prestigious musical honor that carried a debut recital at Town Hall. After Army service in World War II he resumed his career, touring nationwide. Throughout much of the '40s, he appeared annually in recital at Carnegie Hall.
After the success of his first European tour in 1949, Mr. Simon moved to Europe for more than a decade, living primarily in Switzerland.
"There ought to be a law," Robert Sherman wrote in The Times in 1965, bemoaning the rarity of Mr. Simon's appearances in the United States. "An artist of such technical prowess, exciting temperament and musical sensitivity should be heard again and again."
But Mr. Simon's long sojourn in Europe, whose musical climate appeared more tolerant of inspired imperfection, let him grow as he might not have done otherwise, he said.
"Getting away gave me the possibility of having thoughts of my own, of developing my own personality, a chance to find myself, even the chance to play badly!" he told The Times in 1960, on a rare visit to New York.
"I mean," Mr. Simon elaborated, "the chance to play a piece a certain way to see if it will go, and then to find that it's wrong and must be done in some other fashion. Here, that would be a disaster and one simply can't take the chance. Over there one can be less inhibited musically."
Mr. Simon, who also taught over the years at Indiana University and the Juilliard School, had homes in Houston and Geneva. His wife, the former Dina Levinson, died in 2014. In addition to his son, he is survived by two grandchildren.
If Mr. Simon, as The Times reported in 1988, sometimes bristled at the appellation "pianist's pianist," with its implied, if rarefied, marginalization, he was ultimately sanguine about his professional course.
"I have been busy all of my life," he said. "I have had a fine career. In the meantime, a lot of pianists who made big noises have disappeared. I am still around."

Texto completo: A new guard of black quarterbacks is leading the N.F.L. but as 100 years of history have shown -- from Fritz Pollard to Colin Kaepernick -- the league has always needed a push to make progress.
The explosion of young black quarterbacks with phenomenal athletic ability and passing acumen has become the rage of the N.F.L. As defenses in the league have become more athletic, offenses have made an adjustment at the sport's most important position.
Patrick Mahomes of the Kansas City Chiefs won the league's Most Valuable Player Award last season. This year, Lamar Jackson, the second-year quarterback for the Baltimore Ravens, is the N.F.L.'s hottest star. Russell Wilson of the Seattle Seahawks, Deshaun Watson of the Houston Texans and Dak Prescott of the Dallas Cowboys are named among the elite.
If he were alive today, Fritz Pollard, one of the new league's first black players and its first black head coach, would be proud. As the N.F.L. celebrates 100 years, a league that barred black players for many years is now largely dependent on them.
Yet even as black players at every position have become the foundation of this multibillion dollar enterprise, their relationship with the N.F.L., from the league's perspective, has largely been a marriage of convenience, with progress only being brought about by pressure.
Pollard, the Brown University all-American and a single-wing superstar, was on the ground floor in 1920 when the N.F.L. -- first known as the American Professional Football Association -- was formed, and he became a star with the Akron Pros.
Yet a so-called "gentleman's agreement" among N.F.L. owners kept black players out of the N.F.L. from 1934 until 1946. Pollard then became a persistent thorn in the N.F.L.'s side.
Pollard had a blood feud with George Halas, the Chicago Bears founder and N.F.L. pioneer. In a 1971 interview, Pollard said that Halas "was the greatest foe of black football players." He accused Halas of getting "the ball rolling that eventually led to the barring of blacks from professional football in 1933."
Halas denied the claim, but the reality is that the 12-year debarment took a collective effort among N.F.L. owners that set the tone for the future of the league's relationship with black players.
More than 70 years later, a seemingly tacit agreement among N.F.L. owners has left the free-agent quarterback Colin Kaepernick unemployed. Kaepernick, who led San Francisco to the Super Bowl in 2013, began kneeling during the playing of the national anthem in 2016 to protest police brutality and social and economic inequity among people of color in the United States.
The N.F.L. often pats itself on the back by noting that the league desegregated before Major League Baseball, when Kenny Washington and Woody Strode joined the Los Angeles Rams in 1946. But, even in the face of a now-settled lawsuit from Kaepernick accusing owners of colluding against him for his social justice protests, not a single owner has broken ranks to employ him.
When Strode and Washington were hired in 1946, the Rams were relocating from Cleveland to Los Angeles. The Los Angeles Coliseum, under pressure from the local N.A.A.C.P. and black newspapers, insisted that the Rams be integrated in order to use the coliseum.
That same year, the N.F.L. also faced a threat from the newly formed All American Football Conference, which began aggressively going after the talented black players the N.F.L. had intentionally ignored. The N.F.L., facing the loss of what it truly valued -- a competitive edge -- added black players to its rosters. Even though the A.A.F.C. folded in 1949, the upstart league had compelled the N.F.L. to open the door for an influx of black talent.
More than a decade later, another rival, the American Football League, forced the N.F.L. to include a greater number of black players.
While the N.F.L. relied on quotas to control the influx of black players, the A.F.L. hired talented players whenever they could be found. The new league tapped into historically black colleges, giving players who would have been overlooked by the N.F.L. an opportunity to play professional football, even in positions that N.F.L. coaches and executives said black athletes were not intelligent enough to play.
Middle linebacker.
Free safety.
Center.
Quarterback.
In 1968, Tennessee State's Eldridge Dickey became the first black quarterback to be drafted in the first round when the Oakland Raiders made him their first pick. Later that year, Marlin Briscoe, a quarterback at the University of Nebraska-Omaha, became the first black quarterback to start a pro football game when he was pressed into service by the Denver Broncos.
During an interview at his home in Manteca, Calif., R.C. Owens, a wide receiver for the San Francisco 49ers from 1957 to 1961, told me that as more black players entered the N.F.L. with special skill sets and physical gifts, N.F.L. teams were forced to adjust. That meant hiring the best athletes and dropping, to some extent, artificial barriers that reserved specific jobs for white players.
"It became like a domino effect," said Owens, who died in 2012. "First the running backs, then the receivers, then the defensive backs to cover them and the big fast defensive linemen and linebackers to keep up with them and big mobile lineman to block bigger faster defensive players."
Today it would seem that the same competitive imperative has demolished the barrier for black players at quarterback, what with Mahomes and Jackson as the faces of the sport's most glamorous position.
But it's still easy to count, in weeks and months, how some of the N.F.L.'s power brokers initially thought Jackson unworthy, in intelligence and in skill, of the position he now dominates. The very traits at the root of Jackson's success -- his ability to read an opposing defense; the athleticism to elude the best of them all -- were not so long ago in doubt by many and, by others, not considered at all.
That's not much different from the days of Pollard, who would be disappointed by other aspects of today's N.F.L. There are three black head coaches in the N.F.L. There is one black general manager this season among the league's 32 teams.
In the past, equality on the field was forced by rival leagues and innovations, usually brought about by black athletes. What is the imperative to force access to positions of power and control? Morality has never been the league's strong suit.
The N.F.L. can celebrate its amazing growth over 100 years. But when it comes to the relationship between black athletes and the executive suite, the same thinking that for a dozen years barred players who looked like Jackson remains alive and well.

With the age to buy tobacco products, including vaping products, expected to rise to 21, local officials have a mixed reaction to the news.
According to the New York Times, President Trump is expected to sign a bill passed by both the United States House and Senate that makes 21 the minimum age to buy such products.
"I think you'll probably see our school resource officers busier," St. Joseph Police Sergeant Larry Stobbs said. "I imagine it would probably have some impact at Missouri Western where you have a huge amount of students in that age range."
Mosaic Life Care Director of Cardiothoracic Surgery Jane Schwabe said she's in favor of completely banning the products, but thinks the proposed law is a good first step.
"One of the things I'm a big champion for is community health. So we're in the school district talking about lung health and we'll show them what happens with smoking," Schwabe said. "About three years ago when we asked fourth-graders about vaping, they didn't have a clue on what we were talking about."
"Now they all know what it is and they know the brands and they know the flavors and you drive up even to the grade schools and sometimes you'll see kids vaping," she said.
According to the National Institute for Drug Abuse, about 18% of 8th graders vaped within the last month. That number is about 37% for 12th graders.
"With kids coming home from college I'd say it's more frequent that they vape than not," Schwabe said.
Stobbs said raising the age might not keep vaping products of all young people's hands, but that he would expect a similar response to the drinking age being raised.
"If we have one common date, if it's 21 to buy what you'd consider restricted items, it would probably make it a lot easier for clerks working the counter," he said. "Then they'd only have to focus on this one date and right now they're having to focus on different dates for alcohol and tobacco products."
According to ACT Missouri, about 41% of Missouri's population already lives in a "Tobacco 21" municipality.
Stobbs and Schwabe both acknowledged the growing issue of people smoking THC products from a vaporizer, which is illegal in states that haven't legalized marijuana. It's unclear what, if any, impact the proposed federal law would have in that area.
"Especially for the parents who aren't really sure what vaping is, (vaporizers) are disguised to look like a lot of different things like a pen, or a highlighter or they'll look like a USB port," Schwabe said. "So please get on Google and see what they look like."

Texto completo: Gross domestic product, fundamentally a measure of the total value of the nation’s economic output over a specific time period, always has been among the broadest measures of national economic performance.
But, as noted in a series of columns by David Leonhardt of The New York Times, it also has been an indicator of individual financial wellbeing because wages and other indicators of personal financial progress often rose in near accord with GDP.
That especially was true for several decades after World War II, when vast manufacturing enterprises accounted for a high percentage of employment and powerful labor unions fought for labor’s share.
That started to change in the 1970s and has accelerated since, so that a graph line charting GDP growth still coincides roughly with the financial welfare of the top 10% of earners, but diverges sharply for the lower 90%, and by greater degrees down the ladder.
Now a group of Commerce Department economists is working on a new calculation of GDP that still would calculate the overall performance but break it out to reflect the economic wellbeing of different income groups, possibly by each 10% and for the top 1%. The department plans to issue a prototype statistical model next year, and the Federal Reserve already makes such calculations in a more limited way.
Congress should mandate the new calculation. As Nobel laureate economist Simon Kuznets, who oversaw the implementation of the GDP calculation, put it in 1934: “Economic welfare cannot be adequately measured unless the personal distribution of income is known.”

Dailey: Time of season to work on game With players out of class for a month, associate head coach talks recruiting, Walker uconn women's basketball

Texto completo: Storrs - UConn associate head coach Chris Dailey sees the progress that's been made between Nov. 10, UConn's season opener against Cal, and now.
Megan Walker has emerged as a force to be reckoned with. Players like Kyla Irwin, Molly Bent and freshmen Aubrey Griffin and Anna Makurat have stepped up when the team has needed them. The Huskies have put together several really strong halves of basketball that looked closer to vintage UConn than much else this season.
But where No. 2 UConn is right before the New Year is far from where they want to be come March. And so with the players off of school until Jan. 21, this next month will be a crucial step in making a jump as individuals and as a team, Dailey says, especially important for a group such as this one that is learning how few things will come easily this season.
"This next month is big for us because there is no school, and so they don't have anything else to do but spend time on their game," Dailey said. "We have a bunch of games, but there will also be a lot of opportunities for individual improvement and that's something that is important to us in terms of getting better."
Before that, though, comes Sunday: The Huskies will take on Oklahoma in the Hall of Fame Showcase at 4 p.m. at Mohegan Sun Arena. Dailey will serve as head coach while Geno Auriemma continues to recuperate from surgery to alleviate symptoms of diverticulitis.
Dailey's call for individual and team improvement applies across the board, including the team's best player. Walker leads the team with 22.1 points per game (seventh-best in the nation), but things will only get more challenging from here as teams make her the focal point of their preparation against the Huskies.
"I think she's going to watch a lot of film and she's going to understand and see how people are playing her," Dailey said. "That's the biggest part. Part of growth as a player is playing against the person that's guarding you. You can't just run plays, you have to play basketball, and some of that has to do with read and react depending on how they're focusing on you or how their defense is set up."
Dailey, too, wants UConn to be
'bad for basketball'
After UConn signed its 2020 class last month, Auriemma joked his goal was to make UConn bad for basketball again. Dailey, the program's recruiting coordinator, agrees.
"Well I'm hoping to be bad for basketball," Dailey said Friday. "Some people like the underdog role and all of that. I prefer to have the best team and I prefer to have people expect us to do well because we expect ourselves to do well."
The Huskies snagged another verbal commitment just this week, when No. 3 2022 prospect Isuneh Brady announced she intends to join the Huskies in a few years.
"I laugh at the people that make comments about where our recruiting is - they don't know anything about what we do or how we do it," Dailey continued. "I don't think those same people are making comments now. We don't worry about it, but it does make you chuckle a little bit because I think I just read a headline in the New York Times that said 'UConn who?'" [referring to a recent article discussing the rise of the Pac-12]. That made me chuckle too."
Christyn Williams looking to impact the game in different ways
It's way too premature to call it a true 'slump,' but Christyn Williams admits that she's struggling with her offensive game to start the season.
"I feel like last year, things came a lot easier," Williams said. "I feel like I'm in my head a little bit, which is normal."
On paper, her numbers don't pop as concerning. Williams is the team's second-highest scorer with 16 points per game, notching at least 12 in every contest as well as 20-plus twice. Her two-point shooting percentage is right around where it was last season (59 percent last year versus 58 percent this year), but she has had trouble getting her 3-point shot going (37 percent last year versus 30 percent, or 11-for-37, this year).
Williams doesn't see it as an issue of getting the ball to fall, though, as much as one of positioning and making the right reads. Part of that may because, as the team's second-best scorer, opponents are now dedicating more of their defensive efforts to slowing her down. She's been 'limited' to 14 or fewer points in each of the four games (in that same span, she has went 4-for-15 from beyond the arc). Against Notre Dame, she attempted a season-low eight shots; at DePaul she committed six turnovers.
The team's current break from school will allow her some time to break down film and get a better idea of what exactly is holding her up, but in the meantime she's found other ways to contribute. On Monday, that meant rebounding her way into the first double-double of her career (13 points, 11 boards, including four on offense).
"[Auriemma] has been harping on that," Williams said, "because Meg can't be the only one rebounding. So that was the emphasis for that game. He's really been harping on me about defense, again, always, so I've been working on defensive stops too."
So far, Williams' inconsistency hasn't put the team in all too shaky of a position. The Huskies, ranked No. 2 in the nation, will look to improve to 10-0 on Sunday when they face Oklahoma. With 20-plus game remaining, Williams has plenty of time to get back into her scoring groove.
"It's going to be hard at times, and I know that, it's just a matter of figuring out how to get through it," Williams said. "So that was one of those times. Like last year, I hit a wall and I got through it. That's what I'm doing right now."

Texto completo: He may look the part of a guru with his richly patterned robes and chunky crystal jewelry and celebrity clientele. But Durek Verrett -- the sixth-generation Afro-Haitian shaman better known as Shaman Durek -- insists he's here to help people help themselves, with the recent release of his book "Spirit Hacking: Shamanic Keys to Reclaim Your Personal Power, Transform Yourself and Light Up the World."
Of course, the "guru" tag seems to come with the territory when you are Gwyneth Paltrow's "light in shining armor." Verrett, a California native, has 145,000 followers on Instagram and was catapulted further into celebrity status this year when it was announced that he was dating Princess Martha Louise of Norway. But the 45-year-old self-professed spiritual counselor and podcaster says his true mission is to bring the ancient practice of shamanism to the mainstream, helping people cultivate love and acceptance of themselves and others.
"At the core basic level of human nature, we all want to connect," he said in an interview at the Den Meditation in Los Angeles.

Shamanism's philosophy of using connection and spiritual wisdom as a tool to help solve the planet's problems is catching on with a younger generation disconnected from traditional religion and increasingly worried about climate change, income inequality and what their future will look like, says Susan Mokelke, president of the Foundation for Shamanic Studies in Northern California.
--
Here are 10 things you need to know about
Verrett, and shamanism; you'll find a few more at latimes.com/health:
1 There's no denying that shamanism sounds a little woo woo to most, with shamans gathering their knowledge by achieving altered consciousness and communicating with the spirit world, using tools such as drums, rattles, crystals or even singing to clear "resistance in the form of fear or anger patterns," according to the Society for Shamanic Practice website.
2 Shamanism has endured for over 40,000 years. "The shaman's point of view is that medicine is everywhere, and nature wants to help us," said Jaime Meyer, a shamanic practitioner in Minneapolis and president of the Society for Shamanic Practice.
3 Some shamans such as Verrett claim they were chosen for this work by the spirits. He recalls his great-grandmother Mamal, a shaman in Ghana and Haiti, first visiting him in his dreams when he was 5. Others interested in practicing, but without this connection, receive years of shamanic training, learning methods to reach altered states and connect with spiritual guidance and healing, Mokelke said.
4 Dave Asprey, the New York Times bestselling author who coined the term "biohacking" and introduced the masses to Bulletproof Coffee, is among shamanism's believers. Asprey, who visited a shaman on a trip to Tibet (where he got the idea for his wildly popular butter-laden coffee from yak butter tea), says a lot of people call themselves spiritual healers, but only a few such as Verrett seem to have natural ability: "[A] lot of people ... can dunk," he says in the foreword to Verrett's book. "There are a lot fewer Michael Jordans."
5 As a culture, Verrett says, we've become more disconnected and entitled. Stress levels are higher, and more people are turning to alcohol, shopping, drugs, screens and social media as coping mechanisms. "We're not going into nature, writing poetry, learning a new language, taking a cooking course or dancing," Verrett says. "Learning new skills to add to your repertoire of being a human being is not valued in human culture anymore. What is valued is, 'How popular are you?'"
6 Many in the spiritual community preach "love and light," but Verrett says individuals need to be willing to delve into their darkness and self-destructive habits as a form of self-love, rather than kicking the can down the road and engaging in "spiritual bypassing" of this pain.
7 Although Verrett's healing methods and spirit hacks in his book are somewhat unconventional, his message of approaching most situations from a place of love and acceptance is a familiar theme in self-help literature. To get the most out of life, he says, we should approach our everyday encounters with the idea, "How can I find the greatest wisdom and love in this situation?"
8 Like many other spiritual leaders, Verrett believes that our words -- spoken out loud and internally -- create our reality. If we believe life is hard, he says, the universe and our ego will create more challenges to support that narrative. Wouldn't it be better, he says, to adopt the belief that "New opportunities and new experiences are showing up for me to see how things can be easy."
9 Verrett gets frustrated with spiritual leaders who suggest setting an intention: You can't have an intention, "unless you have attention. Put your attention somewhere, and the intention follows."
10 Key to achieving the "lit" state Verrett talks about frequently in his Ancient Wisdom podcast is being honest with yourself and others. "Being good gets you an apple pie," he said. "Being truthful gets you the kingdom."

Texto completo: To the Editor:
Re "Fox News, I Want My Voice Back," by Gretchen Carlson (Op-Ed, Dec. 13):
Ms. Carlson should simply take her voice back.
For all the reasons she argues against nondisclosure agreements in the context of sexual harassment or assault, I would argue that NDAs are "against public policy" and "conscience shocking," two legal criteria for declaring contract provisions void, and unenforceable by the courts.
So say whatever you want, Gretchen. Yes, Fox may sue you, but significant odds are that it will lose. Signing an NDA under these circumstances is inherently coerced.

Texto completo: The move came days after a commission investigating abuse at the school said the academy had failed to protect students' welfare.
LONDON -- The Vienna State Opera on Friday removed all responsibilities from Simona Noja-Nebyla, the managing director of its historic ballet academy. The move came just days after an independent commission said the academy had endangered the well-being of its students.
The academy had given its students "insufficient medical and therapeutic care," the commission, which was set up by the Austrian government, said in a report issued on Tuesday. There also seemed to be "no awareness" that it had a responsibility for its students' health.
The decision to effectively dismiss Ms. Noja-Nebyla was announced in a news release on Friday by the company that oversees all of Austria's federal theaters.
The commission was set up in April after allegations of physical and mental abuse at the academy were revealed by Falter, an Austrian newsmagazine.
Two former students told The New York Times that month that they had been the victims of and witnesses to abuse. One of them, Luisa Solowjowa, said, "Many children have lost their dream to dance." A teacher once kicked her "like a football," she added, causing her to fall over and suffer ligament damage.
The commission's report included further examples of teachers jeopardizing students' well-being, including humiliating them about their appearance and even encouraging them to smoke to lose weight.
The scandal was only one of several to affect the ballet world in recent years. It followed sexual harassment allegations at the New York City Ballet and the Paris Opera Ballet. But it was the first major one that involved children.
The academy is also world renowned, tracing its origins to 1771. It has 136 students, the Vienna State Opera said in a news release, many from outside Austria.
On Tuesday, the Vienna State Opera said in a news release that it had taken many measures to improve the academy including recruiting two in-house psychologists.
The commission acknowledged some of the changes in its report, but said the approach taken suggested the moves were "not primarily motivated by the wish to ensure the well-being of the children and young people" at the academy. It called for further action to make the school "fit for the 21st century."
Sharon Booth, a former teacher at the academy, said in a telephone interview that she welcomed the Vienna State Opera's decision regarding Ms. Noja-Nebyla's losing responsibilities. "It's opening a huge chance to renew the system," she said.
Other renowned ballet schools, like Britain's Royal Ballet, had introduced such measures to protect students decades ago, Ms. Booth said: The academy "needs to be led into 2020 too."

Texto completo: Amid fallout from a scathing inspector general report, the court that oversees national security surveillance is also getting a new presiding judge.
WASHINGTON -- A secretive court that oversees national security surveillance has taken a step toward addressing dysfunction in the system detailed in a recent inspector general report, ordering the Justice Department to identify all cases that an F.B.I. lawyer heavily criticized in the report has worked on, according to an order made public on Friday.
Separately, the court announced that its presiding judge, Rosemary M. Collyer, is stepping down nine weeks earlier than planned for health reasons. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. of the Supreme Court has selected Judge James E. Boasberg to succeed her in that role in the new year. He will be the first judge appointed by a Democrat to lead the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court since 1995.
The developments underscored that the court has entered a period of turmoil and change after the report this month by the Justice Department inspector general that uncovered damning inaccuracies and omissions in applications to wiretap a former Trump campaign adviser, Carter Page.
The report has raised questions about the system by which the F.B.I. obtains wiretap orders and search warrants targeting suspected spies and terrorists under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA. The Justice Department must convince a judge on the FISA court that the target is probably an agent of a foreign power, and it is supposed to disclose any exculpatory information -- not just facts that make the target look suspicious.
But the inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, found that the F.B.I. cherry-picked and misstated the evidence about Mr. Page. Among the problems was that the law enforcement officials presented his long history of meeting with Russian intelligence officials but did not tell the FISA court that Mr. Page had sometimes told the C.I.A. about those meetings.
One of Mr. Horowitz's most serious findings was that during the period when the Justice Department was preparing to seek its third renewal of the Page wiretap order in 2017, a lower-level F.B.I. lawyer assigned to assist the Russia investigation team, Kevin Clinesmith, misled a colleague by altering an email from the C.I.A. about its relationship with him.
Mr. Horowitz has referred his findings about Mr. Clinesmith, who has resigned from the F.B.I., to prosecutors. The Justice Department also informed the FISA court about the issue in classified filings in October and November, according to a newly declassified order. But the order, issued Dec. 5 and made public on Friday, indicated that the court wants more action.
Judge Collyer, as the presiding judge on the 11-member court, ordered the department to identify any other FISA applications that Mr. Clinesmith may have worked on. If there are any others, she said, the department or F.B.I. must explain what steps it would take to ensure every fact in them was accurate.
Judge Collyer also asked whether the Justice Department was referring the matter to Mr. Clinesmith's bar association for potential disciplinary action, like losing his license. (He was not named in the inspector general report or in the newly declassified order, which is partly redacted, but people familiar with the Russia inquiry have identified him.)
A spokesman for the Justice Department, which had until Friday to respond, declined to comment. A lawyer for Mr. Clinesmith did not immediate respond to a request for comment.
In another order this week, after Mr. Horowitz released his report, Judge Collyer rebuked the F.B.I. and demanded a proposal by Jan. 10 for an overhaul to ensure the accuracy of every court filing.
The two orders may end up being her last major actions as the court's presiding judge. Although her tenure was set to end on March 7, when her term on the court would also end, she will step down at the end of this month and Judge Boasberg will take over in that role, the court said on Friday. Judge Collyer will serve as a regular FISA judge for the duration of her term.
In recent days, Judge Collyer has been drawn into the partisan fighting over the Russia investigation, as some Republicans and allies of President Trump have criticized her for waiting until Mr. Horowitz delivered his findings before intervening in the Page FISA dispute.
Judge Collyer's decision to step down from her presiding position nine weeks early stems from health problems and is unrelated to the Page wiretap controversy, said David Sellers, a spokesman for the FISA court.
While the 10 regular FISA court judges serve only once every 11 weeks -- hearing routine wiretap applications for a week at a time -- the presiding judge has constant administrative duties and tends to handle major issues that arise, like responding to the fallout from the inspector general report.
Chief Justice Roberts, in his role as the chief administrator of the judicial branch, selects which serving federal judges will sit for staggered, seven-year terms on the surveillance court. He also decides which of its 11 members will serve as its presiding judge.
Judge Boasberg was appointed to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia by President Barack Obama in 2011, and became a FISA court judge in 2014. He will be the first appointee by a Democratic president to serve as presiding judge since Judge Joyce Hens Green, a Carter appointee, completed her tenure in that role nearly a quarter-century ago.
President George W. Bush appointed Judge Collyer to the Federal District Court in the District of Columbia in 2002. Chief Justice Roberts placed her on the FISA court in 2013, then elevated her to its presiding judge in 2016. That same year, she took senior status -- semiretirement with reduced duties -- from her regular judgeship.

Democrats' diversity won't show in debate

Texto completo: After Sen. Kamala Harris abruptly dropped out of the race for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, the famously inclusive party wasn't looking very inclusive anymore.
Without being too cheeky, you might say that the party that highlights diversity and equality is suffering from an embarrassment of wealthy white men.
Or, as Sen. Cory Booker described the irony, when only six people, all white, had met the party's new threshold to qualify for the debate in Los Angeles, the stage on Dec. 19 is likely to have "more billionaires than Black people."
"What message is that sending - that we heralded the most diverse field in our history," Booker told a morning crowd in Des Moines, "and now we're seeing people like her dropping out of this campaign?"
Yes, political correctness cuts both ways. As much as the party can boast of having more women and people of color than ever in the House after last year's midterm elections, and in their lineup of presidential candidates, it's another big challenge to hold onto that diversity.
Among top-tier candidates of color, businessman Andrew Yang qualified for the debate, just days before the deadline, joining six other candidates on the stage. Booker and former Housing Secretary Julian Castro have met the party's donor threshold, but neither has scored high enough in a single qualifying poll to make the debate, according to The New York Times debate tracker.
Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii scored enough in polling and fundraising to be listed as "on the cusp" as of Tuesday. Former Gov. Devai Patrick of Massachusetts also appears to have entered the race too late to make the stage.
But things can change. With Harris' departure, Booker's blunt blast about billionaires appears to have given a boost to his own fundraising. He raised more than $1 million within three days of Harris dropping out on Dec. 3. The day after Harris dropped out was his best online fundraising day, his campaign announced, and more than half of the surge came from first-time donors.
Of course, I already can see moans and groans in social networks about "identity politics," as if that were a new thing in politics. In fact, women and people of color have seen identity politics played against them for so long that one can hardly blame them for using it to push back, especially in a campaign to unseat President Donald Trump, who often has fashioned a tribe based on conservative grievances.
That's legitimate, in my humble opinion, but it doesn't substitute for a clear theme and purpose to one's campaign. Harris lost momentum on both counts. After her strong performance in the first debate with her takedown of front-runner and former Vice President Joe Biden's early voting record, she seemed to peak quickly, unprepared for criticism of her own record as a prosecutor.
Her campaign struggled with reported fundraising and organizational problems. But mainly she lacked what the late George H.W. Bush once called the "vision thing."
Those questions matter as Democrats try to restore the multiracial, multiethnic coalition that carried President Barack Obama to two victories. About 4.4 million voters who cast ballots for Obama in 2012 stayed home in 2016, according to exit polls by Edison Media Research. More than a third were Black.
So, as much as candidates should never make too much of race or gender politics, which can invite a backlash, they can't take women or people of color for granted either.
The politically awkward possibility of an all-white Democratic debate stage shows, among other new realities, that symbolism isn't as powerful as it used to be with potential voters.
It annoys some liberals when "electability" questions are raised about Sen. Elizabeth Warren, for example. But, for all the milestones that have been made by progressives such as Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders, Black Democrats in particular have been showing a persistent and resilient pull toward the familiar presence of Obama's former vice president, Biden.
That's important, even as South Bend Mayor Pete Büttigieg has gained top-tier status in Iowa polling and Warren is looking strong in New Hampshire, next door to her home state of Massachusetts.
Biden continues to lead in South Carolina, where most of the Democratic primary voters are Black - and where Buttigieg recently scored a 0% of Black voters. The mayor will do better, I'm sure, especially since he has nowhere to go in that poll but up.

Texto completo: Five of the candidates who appeared on Thursday's debate stage have already qualified for the next debate round in January:

The Democratic National Committee on Friday announced its new thresholds for the Jan. 14 primary debate in Des Moines, Iowa, a slight increase from the standards for Thursday's December debate.
Candidates must secure at least 225,000 individual donors, up from 200,000, plus meet a polling threshold of at least 5% support in four DNC-approved state or national primary polls or 7% support in two single-state polls from Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, or Nevada. Candidates must meet the threshold by midnight on Jan. 10 and can count polls publicly released as far back as Nov. 14.
The two other candidates who appeared on Thursday's debate stage, businessman Tom Steyer and entrepreneur Andrew Yang, have not yet qualified. Yang has announced reaching 350,000 donors, beyond the threshold, but has only one qualifying 5% poll so far. Steyer has not announced surpassing the donor threshold and has two qualifying polls.
Two more candidates have met one half of the qualification metric but are unlikely to meet a second portion.
New Jersey Rep. Cory Booker, who did not meet the polling threshold for the December debate, has surpassed 225,000 donors but has no qualifying polls. He also earned no qualifying polls for the December debate.
Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has met the polling threshold but is unlikely to reach the donor threshold. A billionaire who is self-funding his campaign, Bloomberg is not accepting or soliciting campaign donations.
Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and former Housing Secretary Julian Castro each passed the donor threshold for December, placing them on track to secure the required 225,000 donors for January but neither qualified due to lack of polls.
Four other candidates are far from meeting either qualification metric: Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet, former Maryland Rep. John Delaney, former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, and spiritual author Marianne Williamson.
DNC chairman Tom Perez told the New York Times earlier this week that rules for the three February debates, held after the Feb. 3 Iowa caucuses, may eliminate polling or donor thresholds in favor of using results from early-state nominating contests.

IMPEACHMENT AS MAGA THEOLOGY FROM JESUS AND THE SALEM WITCH TRIALS TO LINCOLN AND PEARL HARBOR, TRUMP HAD IT WORSE

Texto completo: Few reputations have undergone the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune as dramatically as President Donald J. Trump in the past month.
It must have gladdened his heart immensely to have topped Abraham Lincoln in a recent survey of Republicans asked to identify the GOP's greatest leader ever. Mr. Trump beat "Honest Abe" by a considerable margin, making a second look at the current lineup on Mount Rushmore not too ridiculous a prospect for modern Republicans.
During Wednesday's impeachment vote, Rep. Barry Loudermilk, R-Ga., and Rep. Fred Keller, R-Butler, both invoked Jesus' crucifixion as the only historical analogy to Mr. Trump's woes that makes any sense to them or their constituents.
Not to be outdone by his fellow crazy man in the Pennsylvania delegation, Rep. Mike Kelly, R-Pa., compared Mr. Trump's impeachment to the Japanese sneak attack at Pearl Harbor that resulted in the death of 2,335 military personnel and civilians along with the destruction of a good chunk of America's Pacific fleet.
For his part, Mr. Trump took a relatively modest route in invoking inappropriate historical analogies in speeches and on Twitter. Instead of comparing himself to Jesus, Mr. Trump declared himself the victim of a modern equivalent of the Salem witch trials.
Tragic irony aside, invoking a historical comparison to women unjustly drowned, hung, torn apart and burned at the stake by a superstitious patriarchy for allegedly being witches is a little more relatable to a MAGA crowd that might find self-aggrandizing allusions to Jesus Christ a wee bit heretical if they really thought it through.
Still, Mr. Trump couldn't resist bolstering his bona fides as the Christian Right's theologian in chief during a rally in Battle Creek, Mich., held at the same moment he was being impeached.
Because the president has perfected a uniquely American brand of political sadism, he launched into a mocking recitation of a conversation he claims to have had with Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Mich., the widow of John Dingell, the longest-serving congressman in history who died earlier this year. Ms. Dingell is serving in his seat.
Mr. Trump claimed that Ms. Dingell thanked him for honoring her husband during a condolence call. She was allegedly so grateful to Mr. Trump for lowering flags over Washington to memorialize him that she also said, "He's looking down, he'd be so thrilled."
Exercising the damnation powers given to him by his cult of religious enablers, Mr. Trump was quick with a quip cruel even by Trumpian standards: "Maybe he's looking up, I don't know?" he said playfully intimating that John Dingell is in hell. The next morning, Michigan's establishment Republicans were calling on Mr. Trump to apologize to the Dingell family. Even a few anchors and reporters at Fox News were shocked.
But as we all know, Mr. Trump is a creature of the moment. The laughter that ensued at the rally certainly contradicts the chorus of a favorite Christian hymn that has become popular since the '70s: "They will know we are Christians / by our love / by our love / they will know we are Christians / by our love."
But as two Republican congressmen made clear, Mr. Trump's impeachment is a bigger miscarriage of justice than any melodrama involving a cross and an itinerant rabbi a couple of millennia ago.
"When Jesus was falsely accused of treason, Pontius Pilate gave Jesus the opportunity to face his accusers," Mr. Loudermilk said without embarrassment during the impeachment vote. "During that sham trial, Pontius Pilate afforded more rights to Jesus than Democrats have afforded this president in this process."
"So I want Democrats voting for impeachment today to know that I'll be praying for them," pious Mr. Keller said during his sackcloth and ashes moment on the House floor. "From the Gospel of Luke, the 23rd chapter, verse 34: And Jesus said, 'Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.'"
The notion of Donald Trump getting a rawer deal than Jesus got from Pilate the day he was crucified only makes sense in a world where the criteria for truth and justice are dictated by Mr. Trump himself.
Just imagine Jesus, beaten, spat upon, stripped naked, hanging from a cross and bleeding like a stuck pig while the soldiers who tortured him look on. Imagine him hanging between two criminals half expecting him to pull a Houdini at the last second given his reputation.
Now, imagine the conversation between Jesus and the repentant thief as their final hour approaches afternoon according to the Cult of Trump's grandiose theology:
Thief: "Any tricks left up your sleeves, boss? We could really use an intervening miracle about now."
Jesus: "Oh, ye of little faith! How dare you ask me to save you from the righteous consequences of your sins at a time like this! Don't you know that as bad as our situation is, it is nothing compared to what my faithful servant Donald Trump will experience in 2,000 years when he is unjustly impeached? If paradise is full of such self-centered wretches as you, it will be an eternal drag, indeed."
Of course this is absurd, but it is only a slight exaggeration beyond what Mr. Trump's most ardent followers effectively believe. In many ways, Mr. Trump's impeachment is his crude way of "dying for the sins" of the MAGA crowd. He's being "persecuted" just as they have been "persecuted" by "godless elites."
That isn't to say that his followers consider him "without sin." The fact that he is just like them, with all of their warts, biases and character flaws, is what attracts them to him in the first place. Mr. Trump doesn't have to die for anyone's sins when he's so good at reflecting them and glibly pronouncing them innocent.
That's why for all of its absurdity, so many of Mr. Trump's followers are comfortable with impeachment being used as a metaphor for the crucifixion. They assume that impeachment will only make Mr. Trump "stronger" and that a resurrection into a second term is just around the corner.

Texto completo: A new drama with Anthony Hopkins and Jonathan Pryce is now on Netflix. On Amazon? An adventure movie with Felicity Jones and Eddie Redmayne.
What's Streaming
THE TWO POPES (2019) Stream on Netflix. Holy men bond, quarrel and drink Fanta in this papal dramedy, which casts two seasoned British actors -- Anthony Hopkins and Jonathan Pryce -- as Catholic leaders with clashing social beliefs. Directed by Fernando Meirelles ("The Constant Gardener") from a screenplay by Anthony McCarten ("Bohemian Rhapsody"), the movie focuses on the relationship between Pope Benedict XVI (Hopkins) and the future Pope Francis, Jorge Bergoglio (Pryce), during a period when Benedict was nearing retirement and Bergoglio was moving toward becoming his successor. "'The Two Popes' is really three movies: a behind-the-scenes tale of Vatican politics, a mini-biopic about the current pontiff, and a two-man study of friendship, rivalry and major British acting," A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times. "The first, though intriguing, is more puzzling than illuminating. The second feels a bit like a Wikipedia page, albeit one with first-rate cinematography. The third is absolutely riveting, a subtle and engaging double portrait that touches on complicated matters of faith, ambition and moral responsibility."
THE AERONAUTS (2019) Stream on Amazon. Hopkins and Pryce spend much of "The Two Popes" in the confines of the Vatican. Felicity Jones and Eddie Redmayne spend much of "The Aeronauts" in a small basket high in the sky. Set in England in 1862, the film is about a balloonist (Jones) and her meteorologist partner (Redmayne), who try to reach record altitudes. The gas-filled balloons that they use to chase that goal give the film's director, Tom Harper, and cinematographer, George Steel, plenty of opportunities for visual spectacle (they worked off a screenplay by Jack Thorne, known for writing the script of the effects-laden stage show "Harry Potter and the Cursed Child"). The result is a movie that "has a natural buoyancy that mostly resists the drag of its earthbound flashbacks," Jeannette Catsoulis wrote in her review for The Times. She called it "equal parts dizzying and dippy."
What's on TV
STAR WARS: EPISODE I -- THE PHANTOM MENACE (1999) 8 p.m. on TNT. Galactic trade negotiations. Jar Jar Binks. Midichlorians. This first entry in George Lucas's "Star Wars" prequel trilogy isn't the most beloved in the series. But if there were ever an ideal time to revisit the movie, now is it: "Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker," in theaters this weekend, puts a cap on a nine-part story line of which "Phantom Menace" is the first chapter. Among the characters whose origins are touched on here is Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), the archetypal cloaked evil leader who has been absent from more recent "Star Wars" movies but makes a heavily teased return in "The Rise of Skywalker."
GLOBAL CITIZEN PRIZE 8 p.m. on NBC. Jennifer Hudson will be on big screens on Friday in the new "Cats" movie. She'll be on small ones, too, as one of the performers at this awards show, which honors people who have been active in fighting worldwide poverty. Other performers include John Legend, Raphael Saadiq, Sting and Stormzy.

Seeing Her Selves Up on the Screen

Texto completo: The movie has been criticized for perpetuating tropes about Muslim Americans, but I identified with the idea of conflicting selves.
"If I had seen something like this when I was growing up, I would have felt less alone," the director Minhal Baig said of her film "Hala."
Baig's coming-of-age story, streaming on Apple TV Plus after a theatrical run in November, follows a Pakistani-American 17-year-old testing the boundaries of her Muslim faith, familial obligations and teenage hormones.
From its opening moments, it is clear this film isn't going to be chaste or avoid the challenges of straddling two worlds: We see the title character masturbating in the bath, only to be interrupted by her mother, who proceeds to scold her for missing the first prayer of the day. The scene is a pure delight, mostly because Baig allows this young Muslim woman to explore her sexuality.
I also had a hard time navigating life as a young Bengali woman and a Muslim in America, and so I identify with Hala (played by Geraldine Viswanathan) in her pursuit of a white love interest and her struggles with her faith and parents. I'm 31 now, and at Hala's age, I was desperate to be a "normal" American white girl. Growing up in Queens among other South Asians, I innately understood whiteness to be like the pair of aspirational jeans that were always a few sizes too small.
Baig, 30, who was born and raised in Chicago to parents from Pakistan, gets at that duality in her film. Hala says she is of "two halves," of two equally authentic selves. At times, she can seem like a walking contradiction, but this is what it is like to navigate two cultures.
"There were things that when I was writing it, I knew that if I share this with my family, it's going to change the story and then the story is not going to be honest," Baig said. Her family still has not watched her movie, which has received mostly positive reviews (a New York Times Critic's Pick). When she started writing, she was trying to process her father's sudden death in 2013.
"Losing my dad made me realize, all of my life, priorities have been centered around these incredibly materialist, consumerist ideas of success. I unfortunately believed that the more that I succeed professionally, that that will translate to happiness, and it didn't work," said Baig, who has directed the short films "After Sophie" and "Pretext," and was a staff writer for "Ramy" and a story editor for "Bojack Horseman."
She continued: "I started from a place of writing these vignettes from when I was a kid and when I was a teenager. That was the foundation of the screenplay. I wrote the script, and then I spent two years at home just dealing with grief and working retail jobs."
While the movie has been dismissed for lacking a nuanced story line and character development that doesn't rely on religious tropes, I identified with "Hala," particularly how it shows tenderness between the protagonist and her parents. She is a brat to her very loving mother (Purbi Joshi), and her father (Azad Khan) disappoints them in the most universal of ways.
Many of the film's critics said it reinforced problematic stereotypes -- foreign parents with accents, threats of arranged marriage and girls reluctantly wearing hijabs. Because of this, many assumed "Hala" was from a white director. Others were dismayed that it did indeed come from a Pakistani-American filmmaker.
"In independent film, it has to come from this very personal and passionate place. And so when I read some of the criticism," Baig said, referring to those who questioned whether her story had come from the studio, "that's just not true." She added that all of her department heads were women and over 70 percent of her crew were women. "I had a lot of creative control on a project even though it was the first really big project that I got to do," she said.
This sort of criticism, however, invariably arrives when a movie features an underrepresented group. Experiences of Islam and how parents relate (or don't relate) to their children are not monolithic. Muslim Americans crave seeing ourselves onscreen, and we rightly need more than one narrative.
"The expectations are very high whenever there's a story that features a Muslim character," Baig said. "The Muslim diaspora is massive, and there are so many different things that people want to see that are a closer reflection of their lives. The critique that there is gatekeeping and that certain kinds of stories are not being pushed out -- that's absolutely true. But that is not something that I, as an individual, can systematically change."
Baig continued, referring to the negative comments: "It's a tough thing to read, but I know that it comes from a place of pain. It comes from a pain of, 'I want something that confirms and affirms my values and the way I've lived my life and the experiences I've had.' That's exactly what led me to make this movie because I had the same pain. The contact I had with Muslim characters was that they were all men, and it was centered through their perspective."
Throughout the movie I kept thinking how I used to avoid sharing stories about my family's ugly, human moments because I was afraid of what people outside my community would think. I was an ambassador for my people, whether Muslim or Bengali or South Asian, and I didn't want their first impression of someone like me to be a negative one. The burden of sanitizing my life added even more stress to the pressure of being a model minority.
The film has also been criticized for perpetuating the idea that a white man is a trophy for women of color -- Hala's love interest, Jesse, is a blonde, amateur poet who also skateboards. I have spent my adulthood interrogating past definitions of beauty, happiness and freedom. And my adult self wanted to roll my eyes at that choice for a character like Hala, unsure of herself and where she belongs, but my teenage self was wide-eyed in adoration for him.
For some, including myself, there was a time that a white man desiring you meant -- to steal a line from the Broadway drama "Slave Play," about interracial couples -- you won the "prize." (Not to mention that it's a message conveyed repeatedly in movies, TV series and advertising.) It showed you were worth a damn and, finally, maybe as beautiful as the skinny white girl.
Ultimately, "Hala" is not really a love story. She doesn't choose Jesse -- in part because of a perceived allegiance to her family that's appropriate of her age. But it reminded me that I have been the brown girl pining over a white boy. And I have been the brown woman who has rejected white acceptance.
"Hala" brought these contradictions together for me. I'm still exorcising my demons over what it means to be "a good Muslim" and how my parents chose to raise me. I often feel like a coward: There are many facets of my life I do not share with my parents. I will never agree with them that praying five times daily is a marker for getting into heaven.
My Bengali girlfriends used to call me an "ABCD," American-born confused Desi, because I never cared about Bollywood and didn't have a wider South Asian network. I now see why who I am and where I'm from gives me a power that no person can dull.
In Hala, I saw myself at 17: a chameleon trying to survive.

Texto completo: The city has admitted that a collapsed pipe, not kitchen grease, caused the accident that affected more than 100 homeowners in Queens.
Two days after Thanksgiving, Ricardo McKenzie smelled a strange odor in his house in the middle of the night.
By noon, his brother Karim, 33, who lived in the basement apartment of the home in Queens, watched, stunned, as raw sewage gushed out of his toilet and bathtub like a fountain. Ricardo McKenzie, 39, said he called 911 repeatedly while his family tried to remove the waste water with sump pumps.
"Seeing your items just float in sewage," Karim said, "was just utter shock."
Officials initially suggested that grease being poured down a sink was a possible cause of the Nov. 30 accident that affected 127 homes in South Jamaica. Residents felt they were being blamed.
But after an investigation, the city's Department of Environmental Protection has determined that the flooding was caused by a collapsed pipe, according to a report obtained by The New York Times that has not been released publicly -- leaving the city liable for damage claims that could reach millions of dollars.
"D.E.P. accepts responsibility," the report reads.
"These types of events are extremely rare," Vincent Sapienza, the D.E.P.'s commissioner, said. "We at the D.E.P. do a good job at regular maintenance. We've got 7,500 miles of sewers, 95 pumping stations, 14 plants, and we do a good job keeping the water moving through the pipes. But, you know, once every five years or so, something like this occurs."
Officials have determined it is not possible to repair the collapsed pipe, and they are now building a new segment of sewer around it, at a cost of about $ 9 million.
For residents, the D.E.P.'s findings confirm what they already believed: They didn't cause the flooding. But it's only a moral victory: Nearly 160 residents remain displaced, with little sense of when they'll be able to return to their homes.
"You just want to be made whole again," Ricardo McKenzie said.
More than two weeks after the flooding, the McKenzies are still living in a hotel. D.E.P. trucks are a common sight on their street, and the odor of sour sewage still floats through the neighborhood. Mr. McKenzie's 4-year-old son, Kenneth, has been living with his wife's family in Brooklyn, and he frequently asks to return home to his parents.
But their house still doesn't have heat, and the basement still smells like raw sewage. Mr. McKenzie said his insurance company told him they will not cover the damage. Basic homeowner and tenant's insurance in New York State does not cover sewer backups.
Many area residents tell a similar story. The 160 residents living in hotel rooms that the Red Cross provided could be there through early January.

The pipe that collapsed and produced the blockage was built in 1987 by the New York State Department of Transportation. It was 42 inches in diameter and located deep beneath a bridge abutment and entry ramp for the 150th Street overpass, which spans South Conduit Avenue and the Belt Parkway.
The pipe's unique location made it difficult for the city to access the area and quickly address the flooding, Mr. Sapienza said. The subsequent investigation has also been complicated by the locale.
"The only thing we do know," Mr. Sapienza said, "is sewer pipes made of reinforced concrete are supposed to last much longer than 32 years."
The city is overseeing the cleanup effort, sending in cleaners in hazmat suits, gutting basements and replacing boilers and hot water heaters. The city's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene is conducting air quality tests, and the comptroller's office is helping people file claims. And the D.E.P. is currently pumping more than 10 million gallons of wastewater into sewers that are not affected by the blockage.
Many families have not been reimbursed yet for any expenses they have incurred, because legally the city requires them to file a claim first.
Those expenses, for most residents, are running to tens of thousands of dollars. Many people who have been forced out of their homes, or need to buy new beds, refrigerators and winter clothes, must pay out of pocket or wait until the city approves their claims.
Supreet Singh, 36, who lives with her husband and 2-year-old daughter, said her family had to put about $ 5,000 on credit cards to cover cleanup equipment before the city provided assistance. They have not been reimbursed.
"It's not like we have the cash to go out and buy stuff, which is what angers a lot of people," Ms. Singh said. "Every one of us is working hard."
Scott Stringer, the city's comptroller, said his office is committed to reviewing claims quickly. The comptroller's office is also allowing people who have suffered damages to submit an estimate, which expedites the process.
"We want residents to know that we're going to do everything in our power to help them," Mr. Stringer said.
Yvette Taylor, 53, lives in one of the affected homes with her adult cousin and mother, who is 81. She is concerned the home is not safe for her family, especially her mother.
Officials from the health department said the main concern is direct exposure to untreated sewage, which can cause gastrointestinal illness, including nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. The air quality tests have shown normal results, according to the health department, and no related illnesses have been reported. Officials said they will inspect each home.
Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University, said the risk of getting sick is low. "We can take a little refuge in the data and the data show that in a circumstance like this, even though it is as my son would say, 'gross,' actually the consequent illness is pretty darn unusual," he said.
Smaller backups, where clogging causes sewage to flow back up and into low-lying municipal pipes, are a common occurrence in New York City. The majority of these incidents occur in Queens, according to the 2019 State of the Sewers report issued annually by the D.E.P.
In February, the City Council passed a law requiring the city to prepare a better plan to prevent sewer-system backups. The legislation also says the city must inspect and clean any backups within 10 days.
Councilman Costa G. Constantinides, from Queens, who sponsored the legislation, said he hoped the bill would be a way to determine what was causing the backups.
"What I've heard consistently has been this talk about grease, and it's much more complicated than just that," he said.
In 2018, 66 percent of backups in New York City, and specifically 80 percent in Queens, were grease-related, one reason for the D.E.P.'s initial diagnosis for the Nov. 30 flooding.
In this case, Mr. Sapienza said, "The pipe just catastrophically failed. It's very rare, extraordinarily rare."
The D.E.P. last inspected this section of pipe in May 2018, using a camera on a small boat pulled from one end to the other, and did not find any issues, according to Mr. Sapienza.
Since 2015, the city has invested $ 1.9 billion to build a comprehensive drainage system that would help to address flooding and infrastructure in southeast Queens, according to Julia Arredondo, a spokeswoman for the mayor's office.
"My heart goes out to the homeowners in Queens who were affected by the sewage blockage. It was a terrible end to such a joyous holiday weekend," Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a statement. "We will continue to assist in any way we can to ensure residents are taken care of."
Karim McKenzie said he never believed grease caused the incident.
"Since I was young, my mom, when she threw out grease, she would always put it in little milk cartons and throw it out. A lot of people know not to throw grease in the toilet or the sink," he said.
Many of his neighbors have said they were offended by the implication that residents would dispose of cooking grease improperly.
But at this point, Karim just wants to go home.
"You still have to fix people's homes," he said. "Let's figure out how we're going to fix people's homes faster, sooner rather than later."

Central Pennsylvania Youth Ballet brings Balanchine's Nutcracker Ballet to Hershey

Texto completo: Darla Hoover has a knack for complicated choreography and elaborate costumes. That’s a good thing since Hoover, the artistic director of the Central Pennsylvania Youth Ballet and répétiteur for the Balanchine Trust, wears two hats and works hand in hand with herself. She’s responsible for making sure every step in the ballet’s performances of “George Balanchine’s The Nutcracker” is exactly correct.
The show will be performed Saturday and Sunday at the Hershey Theatre.
The Central Penn Youth Ballet is the only licensed school in the world that has the rights to perform the acclaimed “George Balanchine’s The Nutcracker.”
This is due to founder Marcia Dale Weary, who died in March. Her obituary in The New York Times recalled that her reputation as an excellent teacher was “the reason so many gifted students came to Carlisle. Graduates are on the rosters of nearly every important American company, including New York City Ballet, American Ballet Theater, San Francisco Ballet, Pacific Northwest Ballet and Miami City Ballet.”
Hoover, 58, was one of Weary’s students and trained in Carlisle until she left the school and moved to New York City at age 15. She continued her training at the School of American Ballet and went on to the New York City Ballet and worked with the famous ballet choreographer George Balanchine from 1980 to 1991.
“He was an absolute gentleman,” Hoover says. “He didn’t need to raise his voice or scream like other directors do. Just hearing him say “No, dear” was devastating. You aspired to please him.”
Hoover has been involved with “The Nutcracker” for 40 years this year. She has danced every role in the performance.
“The only one I disliked dancing was Marzipan. It was too contained for me. I liked to fly,” Hoover says. “When I was trained by Marcia in the barn, it didn’t have all the studios it has today. It only had Studio A and Studio B, which are really quite small. I thought this was typical, but when I got to New York, I realized I had been dancing on a postage stamp. From that moment on, all I wanted to do was be let out of my cage.”
Now she spends her time traveling back and forth between New York City and Carlisle to bring Balanchine’s version of the classic holiday ballet to Pennsylvania.
“It’s a masterpiece done by a master,” Hoover says. “Everyone is familiar with Tchaikovsky’s score, but through Balanchine’s choreography your eyes get to hear the music.”
Hoover appreciates the familiarity the ballet brings every December. And, despite knowing every step of the ballet, she still gets caught up in the magic.
“Balanchine choreographed the angels to be standing on the perimeter of the stage as the Sugar Plum is doing her variation,” Hoover says. “Just that alone is so magical and heartwarming because you see those little 6-year olds looking up at the Fairy and they are living this moment. That is pure magic to them. Sometimes I get so caught up watching their faces, and it’s like ‘Oh my goodness, I was supposed to be watching the Sugar Plum and correcting her.’ ”

Buttigieg is right about Elizabeth Warren’s big-money hypocrisy

Texto completo: Politicians aren’t exactly known for practicing what they preach. It’s rare that they will call out their own. Yet Pete Buttigieg did just that at Thursday night’s Democratic presidential debate.
The mayor of South Bend, Indiana, started by pointing out the glaring contradiction posed by the fact that front-runners such as Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are campaigning on “soak the rich” rhetoric but are millionaires themselves.
"I am the only person on this stage who is not a millionaire or billionaire,” Buttigieg said. "We need to stop with the purity tests we can't pass."
Then he targeted Warren directly. The mayor chimed in, saying, “Since when?,” as Warren touted that she doesn’t take so-called big money donations and railed against her fellow candidates for doing so. Buttigieg then called her out, noting that she has transferred money from her Senate campaign funds to her presidential campaign and that much of that Senate money was raised at the same kind of shady dinners with fundraisers she’s blasting everyone else for.
Well done, Mayor Pete. He has the facts on his side.
Even the left-leaning New York Times published an article highlighting Warren’s hypocrisy, titled “How Elizabeth Warren Raised Big Money Before She Denounced Big Money.” It covered how “Ms. Warren wooed wealthy donors for years, stockpiling money from fund-raisers, and has used $10.4 million from her 2018 Senate race to underwrite her 2020 bid.”
Consider this excerpt, revealing the kind of thing that Warren has been doing for years:
On the highest floor of the tallest building in Boston, Senator Elizabeth Warren was busy collecting big checks from some of the city’s politically connected insiders. It was April 2018 and Ms. Warren, up for re-election, was at a breakfast fund-raiser hosted for her by John M. Connors Jr., one of the old-guard power brokers of Massachusetts. Soon after, Ms. Warren was in Manhattan doing the same. There would be trips to Hollywood and Silicon Valley, Martha’s Vineyard and Philadelphia — all with fund-raisers on the agenda. She collected campaign funds at the private home of at least one California megadonor, and was hosted by another in Florida. She held finance events until two weeks before her all-but-assured re-election last November.
Buttigieg deserves credit for calling Warren’s hypocrisy out, especially considering the wrath from leftist activists he is sure to incur. It’s insufferable to listen to Warren rail against money in politics when she was doing the same thing basically yesterday. Now, the voters have one more reminder that Warren is a fraud.

How 'Kramer vs. Kramer' hit a national nerve, 40 years before 'Marriage Story'

Resumen: With divorce rates at an all-time high, 1979's 'Kramer vs. Kramer,' starring Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep, redefined what it meant to be a parent.

Texto completo: The big Christmas movies in 1979 were supposed to be Steven Spielberg’s "1941," Disney’s "The Black Hole" and "Star Trek: The Motion Picture. "
But a small courtroom drama bested them and every other holiday release, becoming the highest-grossing film of the year. "Kramer vs. Kramer," which opened 40 years ago this week, just as the revolutionary 1970s crawled to a finish, tapped into an inflammatory issue defining the times.
The film’s plot was little more than TV-movie fodder: A housewife (Meryl Streep) abruptly leaves her career-driven husband (Dustin Hoffman) and their 6-year-old son (Justin Henry) in a quest to find herself, only to return 15 months later to sue her now ex-husband for custody of the child.
But with divorce rates at their highest ever, director Robert Benton’s adaption of Avery Corman’s 1977 novel touched a national nerve.
Are mothers meant to be a child’s default caregiver? What is the definition of the word parent?
Divorce month?January likely to see spike in divorce filings as holidays end
Believe the hype: Meryl Streep calls upcoming 'Little Women' adaptation a 'masterpiece'
Scarlett Johansson on 'Marriage Story': Why it's good to 'wallow for a little bit'
The film punctuated a decade of a war between the sexes, where marriage itself had come under fire. If the anger on display in the film by Hoffman’s 30-something ad executive is understandable – wife Joanna’s top-of-story desertion was both sudden and ill-explained – it spoke to a larger sense of anger felt among men of his generation, raised to view marriage through a self-reflecting prism. (Ted’s reaction to his wife’s decision, railing to a family friend: “Can’t you understand what she’s done to me?”)
For her part, Joanna Kramer was mirroring the dilemma facing many women of the same post-war generation, born into a black-and-white world that had taken on color. “All my life,” she later attempts to explain to Ted, “I’ve felt like … somebody’s wife or mother or daughter. Even when we were together, I never knew who I was. ”
It was new territory for the big screen. The New York Times wrote at the time: “In a country where the lives of 1 million children are changed each year by divorce, the moviemakers could hardly have picked a more provocative theme. The plot of the film, one that would have sounded bizarre a decade ago, seems entirely plausible in today's world of mothers seeking self-fulfillment and fathers seeking custody of young children. ”
"Kramer vs. Kramer" packed theaters, accelerated conversations and sparked debate. It also framed what family studies professor Angie Schock, writing in 2003’s "American Masculinities: A Historical Encyclopedia," called “an emergent men's movement” of the 1970s that challenged “restricted gender-defined family roles. ”
Men were becoming thinkers and feelers, not just doers. Fragile and emotional. Getting in touch with their feelings, as it was known at the time. Especially onscreen: Overachiever Ted Kramer is seen unmoored by the simple task of making French toast for his son. His single-father fear and sadness are on wide-screen display.
"Kramer vs. Kramer" was, in fact, one of no fewer than six big-name movies released in the final three months of 1979 that showcased this evolving American male. "Starting Over" (with Burt Reynolds), "10" (Dudley Moore), "And Justice for All" (Al Pacino), "The Electric Horseman" (Robert Redford) and "Chapter Two" (James Caan) each presented portraits of successful career men at mid-life, wrestling with emotional issues.
It was a long way from "True Grit" and "Patton," which started the '70s, with John Wayne and George C. Scott winning Oscars for prototypical masculine roles.
"Kramer vs. Kramer" came down to a courtroom battle that pit tradition against change as much as it did spouse against spouse. Amid an amplifying national conversation about divorce and, especially, its consequences, its everybody-wins resolution – mother is awarded custody; mother decides at the last minute the child is better left with father – made for a satisfying onscreen drama on the way to Oscar glory for Benton, Hoffman, Streep and the film itself.
But it belied the reality of what was becoming a less easily resolved real-life legal staple. And still is today, even as divorce rates have dwindled. Noah Baumbach’s just-out "Marriage Story," with Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson, offers a post-split custody case of its own, informed by the director’s own experiences.
Forty years after "Kramer vs. Kramer," the film’s exploration of gender roles and female identity is also front page all over again against the backdrop of another revolutionary movement called #MeToo.

Texto completo: THURSDAY
>> Kingston Trio has Hawaii history
When the Kingston Trio play at the Hawaii Theatre today, it will be a kind of homecoming. Original and current members of the trio have many connections to Hawaii.
The original trio played a large part in bringing American folk music to the mainstream of popular consciousness, from 1958 onwards. In that year, the Trio released its first album and its hit recording of “Tom Dooley,” and went on to dominate the charts over the next few years, with 14 albums that made Billboard’s Top 10.
Both Bob Shane and Dave Guard, two founding members of the original Trio, were born and raised in Hawaii. Shane, 85, is the only living member of the original trio; Nick Reynolds died in 2008 at age 75 and Guard died in 1991 at age 56.
Shane, a fourth-generation islander born in Hilo, famously taught himself to play guitar and ukulele as a youth. While attending Punahou school on Oahu, he met classmate Guard and a musical collaboration was born.
Shane endorses the current Trio, stating, “It was Nick Reynolds’ and my fondest hope that these great musicians would carry on the Trio musical legacy.”
Trio member Tim Gorelangton was born in Hawaii, as was his father, Eaton; his grandfather, Cecil Gorelangton, married Julia Hope Kamakia Magoon in Hawaii and started their family.
All three members — Gorelangton, Mike Marvin and Don Marovich — have links to the original group. Gorelangton recorded with Reynolds before joining; Marovich, who plays the guitar, banjo and mandolin, performed with the Trio.
Marvin considers himself the the musical “adopted son” of founding member Reynolds, who was his musical mentor.
The current trio cites Bob Dylan, Crosby, Stills & Nash and The Eagles, Mumford & Sons and The Avett Brothers as influences, still carrying forth the tradition of folk music and Americana.
“I am proud to continue The Kingston Trio tradition and to share the music Nick, Dave, Bob and John performed, getting audiences everywhere up and singing with us,” Marvin said.
They arrive in Honolulu as part of the Trio’s “Keep The Music Playing” tour, with a new, live CD to promote.

FRIDAY-SATURDAY
>> Johnny Mathis celebrates Christmas
Johnny Mathis is in the Blaisdell Concert Hall tomorrow and Saturday doing what he’s done for more than 60 years — sharing the emotion of the songs he loves.
“The thing about music is that its very emotional. Most people who participate in it — especially singers — get emotional when they sing. It is what music is all about,” Mathis said.
The Honolulu shows are stops on his ongoing “Voice of Romance” tour, with a set list that includes songs from Mathis’ latest album, 2017’s “Johnny Mathis Sings The Great New American Song Book,” and selections from his several albums of Christmas songs. Mathis’ first Christmas album, “Merry Christmas,” was released in 1958 and has sold more than five-million copies.
Mathis grew up singing with the encouragement of his father, Clem Mathis, who took him San Francisco area nightclubs to see the entertainers performing there. When jazz pianist Erroll Garner played a date at jazz club in the area, Clem made sure that young Johnny got to talk with him.
“I was about 13 years old,” Mathis recalled. “He always played it more than once each time, and it had no lyrics. There I was, all of 13 years old, telling someone as important as Erroll Garner that I wished it had lyrics so I could sing it.”
Mathis got his wish years later when veteran lyricist Johnny Burke wrote lyrics for the melody. Mathis’s recording of “Misty,” released in 1959, sold more than 2 million copies; 60 years later, his version is still definitive.
Among Mathis’ many other career highlights are more classic oldies — think “Chances Are,” “The Twelfth of Never,” “Gina” and “What Will My Mary Say” — and hit duets with Deniece Williams, Gladys Knight and Regina Bell. A duet he recorded with Freda Payne is scheduled for release in the first half of next year.

FRIDAY AND SUNDAY
>> Opera singers perform holiday favorites
Ta‘u Pupu‘a, the former pro football player turned opera singer, returns to Hawaii to perform a program of holiday and opera favorites this weekend.
His concert, “The Greatest Gift of All,” was organized by Methodist churches in Aiea and Honolulu to raise funds for charitable organizations in Honolulu.
Pupu‘a was born in Tonga and studied music at the University of Utah on a football scholarship. He played briefly in the NFL before a career-ending injury. After meeting the great soprano Kiri Te Kanawa, a New Zealander of Maori descent, at an autograph signing in New York, he got an audition at Juilliard, which offered him a scholarship. He’s been appearing in major opera houses around the world since 2011. His performance in Hawaii Opera Theatre’s 2013 production of “Tosca” received praise from the Matthew Gurewitsch in the New York Times, for a voice that “rang out thrillingly in Cavaradossi’s cries of victory over tyranny then scaled back to plangent tenderness in his reminiscence of a never-to-be-repeated night of love.”
Ta‘u brings three accomplished opera singers to perform with him: soprano Marsha Thompson, winner of the Opera Orchestra of New York Vocal Competition and the Enrico Caruso Awards Competition; soprano Nayoung Ban, who trained at Mannes College of Music in New York and at Chung Ang University in Korea; and baritone SeungHyeon Baek, another graduate of Mannes and Chung Ang who has peformed in New York and Florida. The quartet will perform as soloists in Beethoven’s Beethoven’s “Ode to Joy” with the Hawai‘i Symphony Orchestra on Jan. 4 and 5 at Blaisdell Concert Hall.
A combined choir of Aiea Korean and Christ United Methodist churches and a Tongan choir will also perform.

>> Azure and Tennyson play the Blue Note
When vocalist Azure McCall met pianist Tennyson Stephens — it may gave been in 1979, when Stephens was playing at Marrakesh, an upscale Kalakaua Avenue jazz club – it was the birth of one of the great musical marriages in modern Waikiki entertainment. Stephens’ technical dexterity and his imagination as an arranger were half of the musical equation. McCall’s vocal style, stage presence and enjoyment of sophisticated lyrics was the other.
McCall was already a “name” on the Waikiki entertainment scene when they met. A break-out engagement with Augie Rey at the Hale Makai seven years earlier had put her on the map. (The drinking age in the 1970s was 18, and so it is certainly possible that a Punahou basketball team member known as Barry Obama could have seen her singing somewhere before he left Hawaii for college in 1979.)
In the years that followed, McCall and Stephens became one of the top-draw duos in Hawaii. And, in 2008, they played a career milestone acoustic set for the Punahou grad now known as Barack Obama at a private event, a month before he was elected president.
Its been years since McCall and Stephens left Oahu for opportunities elsewhere, and all that history makes the duo’s Monday night one-nighter at the Blue Note a big event in local entertainment — but, there’s more.
McCall also made island entertainment history as a founding member of the Jive Sisters with Shari Lynn and Annie Renick (then Annie MacLachlan), the first modern Hawaii vocal ensemble to revive the classic American pop sound of the Andrews Sisters. Lynn and Renick will be joining McCall onstage for a Jive Sisters reunion at these shows, their first in more than 10 years.

Boeing's struggle to regain the flying public's full trust [Corrected 12/21/2019]

Texto completo: Air travel is safe -- and trusted by the American flying public -- because aircraft manufacturers, airline operators and government regulators all perform at very high levels. The same is generally true in many other countries.
Chicago-based Boeing, one of the world's leading technology companies and the largest U.S. exporter, ripped a gigantic hole in the fabric of international air travel by mishandling the development and rollout of a new aircraft. Two of its 737 Max jetliners crashed in less than five months, killing a total of 346 people in Indonesia and Ethiopia.
The 737 Max was supposed to be one of the most advanced and reliable (read: safe) planes in the sky. Perhaps that will turn out to be true, but the aircraft has been grounded since March. Boeing this week said it would suspend production in January as the company works to prove to the Federal Aviation Administration and foreign regulators that the 737 Max deserves to fly again.
Boeing is so enormous that the production shutdown could create a noticeable drag on the U.S. economy. The company has orders for about 5,000 Max jets and has built 400 at its Renton, Washington, plant that it hasn't delivered. Airlines -- including United, Southwest and American -- are counting on the 737 Max. They've been forced to rejigger schedules and cancel flights.
Boeing had said it would get the 737 Max back in the sky by the end of 2019 but that won't happen. The company's shares have taken a major hit and CEO Dennis Muilenburg was stripped of his additional title of chairman.
A front-page New York Times news story described Boeing's situation as "the worst crisis in its 103-year history." If that's an exaggeration it's only slightly so, reflecting the devastating blow to Boeing's reputation: Here is the great American manufacturer, creator of the 747 and other fabulous planes, struggling to convince regulators its new jet is airworthy.
The two fatal crashes, involving new 737 Max jets flown by Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines, occurred in similar fashion during good weather, suggesting a glitch with sophisticated software: An automated anti-stalling program known as MCAS, or Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, apparently steered the planes into sharp dives.
Boeing needs to fix the software and assuage the regulators, but problems with MCAS may run deeper in the company's culture. There are questions about whether Boeing hurried the development process and properly explained MCAS to airlines, pilots and regulators, among other possible failings.
All of those issues will have to be addressed satisfactorily for the 737 Max to be recertified to fly. Then Boeing and its airline customers will face another tough task: convincing passengers that the plane is safe to board.
It's easy for passengers in Chicago and around the globe to feel good about Boeing, and to embrace the miracle of flight -- until something goes terribly wrong. At which point Boeing's struggle to regain the flying public's full trust begins anew.

Heidi Hynes, 51, Dies; Bronx Transplant Was a Crusader for the Poor

Texto completo: Dismayed by inequality and injustice, a white woman from the Midwest devoted her abbreviated career to helping poor blacks and Latinos in the Bronx.
Heidi Hynes grew up in Kansas City, Mo., where both her parents were gregarious volunteers for the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, a Catholic group whose credo is "End Poverty Through Systemic Change."
As a teenager, she searched for a racially integrated church to join -- "which in Kansas City was not easy to find," her mother, Michele Schloegel, said -- and one year Heidi even desegregated the holiday decorations.
"I am decorating my angel Christmas tree," Ms. Schloegel said, "and I remembered the first time Heidi saw it, she said 'Mom!' and went right out with her sister to get me some black angels."
All of which may help explain why Ms. Hynes, after attending the Jesuit-run Fordham University in the Bronx in the 1980s and majoring in philosophy, stayed in the borough and devoted her career to improving the lives of her mostly nonwhite and poor neighbors.
From 1997 through mid-2018, when she developed the rectal cancer that led to her death at her home in the Bronx on Nov. 29 at 51, Ms. Hynes was the executive director of the Mary Mitchell Family and Youth Center in the Crotona section of the South Bronx, which runs after-school classes, a self-defense program, a fresh produce cooperative called La Canasta (the Basket) and community gardens. The center was founded in 1997 and named after an early organizer of youth and employment programs in the Bronx.
An alumnus of the Catholic Worker Movement on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, Ms. Hynes served for a year with the Franciscan Friars of Atonement at its mission in Jamaica. She then worked as a tenant and housing community organizer for the Northwest Bronx Community and Clergy Coalition before joining the Mary Mitchell Center.
"She fell in love with the community, and she never left," Lurgen Guzman, the center's program director, said.
Ms. Hynes was indefatigable in her advocacy.
Demanding that the government help homeowners swamped by debt accumulated in the subprime mortgage crisis in the 2000s, she picketed the home of Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman at the time, and joined a small group that met with him privately.
Complaining that local teenagers often risked their lives by joining the military only because they had few other options, she vigorously opposed the Iraq war and protested against it with Bronx Action for Justice and Peace, one of a number of antiwar groups formed across the country after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
Neither Kansas City nor New York neighborhoods were models of racial integration, and while Fordham had taken steps to commingle with the community, the campus that greeted her in the mid-1980s was a largely white enclave surrounded by poor black and Hispanic neighbors.
By then the Bronx had hemorrhaged non-Hispanic whites. Landlords had often abandoned or even burned down their buildings, deciding that the rents they charged, though too high for many tenants, were insufficient to make continued ownership profitable.
"She didn't think there was anything wrong with those people in the neighborhood, and she was drawn to helping them," her husband, Brian T. Hynes, said in a phone interview. "As she continued to look at health, education, housing and other disparities, she never lost that sense of the original injustice of segregation, which guaranteed that browner people were in communities that had the worst of everything."
Income inequality and concomitant barriers to affordable housing meant less mingling of the poor with the rich, Ms. Hynes said.
"People who are poor help people who are poor more than rich people do," she told The New York Times in 2014. "That's because we live with each other and know each other. Other people think the poor are trying to scam them. That's the saddest part of the hyper-segregation of this city -- that people in need are deemed unworthy. "
Ms. Hynes was determined, her husband said, to direct her energy, optimism and middle-class prerogatives toward concrete progress.
"She felt like the way to address the relative privileges that she had, to make them not be a stain on her," Mr. Hynes said, "was to use them to try to help a community flourish when it had so many factors pointing it away from flourishing."
Heidi Marie Schloegel was born in Kansas City on Jan. 19, 1968, to Frank J. Schloegel III and Ann Michele (McGrath) Schloegel. Her father pioneered a dental health maintenance plan in Kansas City and later opened a restaurant, Woodyard Bar-B-Que. Her mother was a homemaker and is now chief financial officer of the dental plan.
The family moved to Windsor, Ontario, then returned to Missouri when Heidi was 10. She graduated from St. Teresa's Academy in Kansas City. After receiving her bachelor's degree from Fordham in 1990 and serving as an aid worker in Jamaica, she took a $ 10-a-week social service job on the Lower East Side and moved into the Catholic Worker House, where she met her future husband.
The couple married in 1995. In addition to Mr. Hynes, who confirmed the death, and her mother, Ms. Hynes is also survived by their daughter, Frieda; her father; her sister, Theresa Scott; and her brother, Frank IV.
In the Bronx, she worked with Astin Jacobo, a community organizer who established the Mary Mitchell Center in 1997.
"She became a Bronxite by stint of her commitment, openheartedness and guileless conviction that a better world was possible," said Eileen Markey, who met Ms. Hynes as a fellow student at Fordham and is an assistant professor of journalism and media studies at Lehman College of the City University of New York. "She knew the game was rigged for the rich and mighty, but she believed God dwelt on the other end of the scale and was worth fighting for."
Those who knew Ms. Hynes best praised her as selfless ("People would become better if they stopped trying to be better off," she said) and courageous.
"She had no fear, or didn't let it stop her from doing what she thought needed to be done," her mother said in an interview.
In 2009, after a stray bullet whizzed into the outdoor basketball court of the Mary Mitchell Center, she protested gun violence by transplanting the center's after-school program to the steps of City Hall.
She fought for more city spending on after-school programs, declaring: "The kids in Crotona need prevention, not policing. We want to keep them from getting in fights and not shooting each other, not catch them after they shoot somebody."
At her wake, Ruben Diaz Jr., the Bronx borough president, said: "What I loved about Heidi the most is that she defended our leadership behind our backs, but, boy, did she give us hell to our faces. That is a true friend."

Texto completo: And who gets to say? As the latest list of lauded style-setters arrives, it may be time to say goodbye to the whole concept.
This weekend, the International Best-Dressed List was released -- its 79th iteration, but the first under its new caretaker, Air Mail, the Graydon Carter newsletter/zine. Did you notice?
Once upon a time the crowning of a new set of style royalty was so newsworthy that reporters from The Rocky Mountain News to The Daily Mail in England would vie for the scoop. And yet this year, the announcement that Cate Blanchett and Roger Federer had taken top honors, that Janelle Monáe, Zoë Kravitz, LeBron James and Zac Posen (among others -- 30 in all, from 16 countries) had also been recognized, feels more anticlimactic than edge-of-the-seat anticipatory.
Despite our seeming unending appetite for "best of" lists (which this year has taken an even more extreme turn thanks to the end of the decade), all of them apparently read and pored over and shared until they trend on a variety of metrics, are we, actually, over the best-dressed list? The one that was among the first of them all?
I am beginning to think the answer is yes.
In our fractured world, where the individual has become ascendant and the digital sphere has elevated the obscure to the influential, where trends have devolved into everything you want all the time, and formality has become a choice rather than a professional diktat, the idea of an unnamed group of people ruling on who is "best dressed" seems increasingly as anachronistic as "no white after Labor Day." (Tell that to Nancy Pelosi.)
"Best dressed" has become an empty term. This is a time of "viral dress" and "influential dress," ideas that often have little do with the subjective value judgment attached to the word "best," and which are measurable in some objective way.
But "best," with all its implications of a certain elite and ineffable -- what? style, good taste, elegance? -- seems tied to another era, one in which a small group acted as gatekeepers of power, not to mention of social and cultural capital.
It is an era chronicled extensively in a book by Amy Fine Collins, a journalist who is herself in the Best-Dressed Hall of Fame, published earlier this fall by Rizzoli (and who is part of the governing body of the current International Best-Dressed List).
Though it is not the first book about the list -- in 2004, Eleanor Lambert, the founder of the list, was a co-author of "Ultimate Style: The Best of the Best-Dressed List" -- it is the most comprehensive.
"The International Best Dressed List: The Official Story" is filled with swanning, swooning pictures from the 1940s to today: of Babe Paley, Jackie Kennedy and Bianca Jagger; Sidney Poitier, Rihanna and Lady Gaga.
It also includes gossipy tidbits about how the list was made, how it evolved to reflect the society it chronicled, and a relatively convincing case for why, though it has been debated and dismissed and decried almost since its inception (in 1999 The New York Times called the list "absurdly quaint"), it is still going.
Founded in 1940 by Ms. Lambert, a publicist, as a scheme to draw attention to the American fashion industry, the best-dressed list aimed to celebrate both individual style and those who invested in a more classic elegance: the looks of singularities like Diana Vreeland and China Chow, as well as famous designer champions like C.Z. Guest and the Duchess of Windsor.
They were women (and latterly men) who went to the sort of events that were often photographed, thus putting them in a position to influence other people's choices.
It has changed with the times, no question. Attempted to stay current. Diversified. Youthquaked. Celebrated celebrities who became style setters when, as Ms. Fine Collins said in an interview over tea at the Carlyle, "the fashion and entertainment industries began to converge."
As you go through the decades, you see figures emerge on the list as they emerged on the pop culture scene: Mary Tyler Moore, Diahann Carroll, Rudolf Nureyev.
The list tried to fight against some of the worst evolutions in fashion. In 2003, after Ms. Lambert retired and "bequeathed" her invention to four editors -- Mr. Carter, Ms. Fine Collins, Reinaldo Herrera and Aimée Bell -- it moved, with some fanfare, to Vanity Fair.
At the time, Ms. Bell told The Times, "Those who are dressed by stylists are banned from the list." (That notion obviously didn't last long, since it would have taken every celeb off the table, which was not a tenable proposition for the magazine.)
But as much as it has changed and been, as Ms. Fine Collins said, "elastic and flexible and able to adapt to what is happening in the zeitgeist," it has also relied largely on certain commonalities: access, privilege, the ability to go out a lot.
Even as it became more diverse, it became more diverse within certain very limited paradigms, chief among them fame and money.
And it has spawned an entire sector.
We can thank the International Best-Dressed List for Mr. Blackwell's Worst-Dressed list, founded in 1964. For the fact that almost every magazine now has its own best-dressed list, including People (Best-Dressed Stars), GQ (Best-Dressed Men) and Sports Illustrated (Best-Dressed Athletes). For Vogue one-upping them all with Best-Dressed of the Week and for Vanity Fair further clouding the issue by continuing to curate its own best-dressed list even after Mr. Carter, Ms. Fine Collins and Ms. Bell left in 2017 and 2018, Ms. Lambert's list in hand.
For the Oscars and the Met gala getting their own best- and worst-dressed lists -- multiple versions. For Roger Stone, the clotheshorse and political operative convicted of witness tampering and lying to Congress, creating his own: Mr. Stone's Best and Worst Dressed List (presumably not anymore). For the fact that there is now a best-dressed list for pretty much anyone's liking.
Indeed, if I were making a list, it would include, say, the women in white at the State of the Union. The woman in Sudan (also in white). The yellow vests. Billy Porter in a dress at the Oscars. Lizzo with her little bag. In other words, the moments in fashion this year when dress became a symbol of social and political change. But that's me. You try! (It's both a fun and difficult exercise.)
And though the caretakers of the International List claim theirs is the only true list, since it was the first, there's nothing that says primogeniture equals ownership in this particular case.
Which is why, though the book was conceived in part as an argument that said list -- the original one, with past and pedigree -- can be seen as a mirror held up to society, a history in chiffon and silk, it functions less as a case for the list's continued relevance than as a very well-accessorized memorial.
That's why the unveiling of the latest iteration of the list seems like the echo of a coda to a symphony heard long ago.
After all, if there is one truism of today it is that everyone can take pictures of themselves in their bedrooms (or on the street or outside a space they may not actually have access to) and have their photos reach a million people -- thus, potentially, changing how others dress.
And those people don't need the approval of the insiders to do it. In fact, the lack of approval of insiders is part of their appeal.
So if the International Best-Dressed List really is a reflection of the times, perhaps the only way for it to truly represent where we are now is for it to acknowledge its own natural, gorgeously appointed, demise.

Texto completo: The 1966 television adaptation of the book "How the Grinch Stole Christmas!" spawned movies, musicals and merchandise. It has endured with fans.
On Dec. 18, 1966, "How the Grinch Stole Christmas!" debuted on CBS. Based on the beloved book about a neon beast with a stingy heart, the animated special was dismissed as a trifle.
Some lauded the animation and Boris Karloff's throaty narration as the Grinch. Others panned it as a morality tale that paled when compared with the book written by Theodor Geisel, better known as Dr. Seuss. The New York Times was among those, calling it a "creation that should be left undisturbed on the printed page."
But in the more than 50 years since its debut, the animated special, directed by Chuck Jones and Ben Washam, has become a holiday classic and turned into a live-action movie, a Broadway musical, an updated animated film and a retailer's fever dream of pantookas, fuzzle fuzz and fliffer bloofs.
In recent years, critics wholly embraced the original, giving it stellar reviews. (It has a 100 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes.) And the story's popularity persists in reruns, touring shows and as a merchandising juggernaut. So much so, this year it inspired the title of a pulp romance novel.

The Times has chronicled the many iterations of the Grinch over the years. The book, which was published in 1957, was inspired by a Redbook article by Dr. Seuss that came out the same year. But the story, with its feel-good message of kindness over consumerism, gained a wider audience on television in the 1960s when a surge of animated Christmas specials were aired.
"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" premiered in 1964, created by Rankin/Bass Productions, then a popular animation company that used three-dimensional puppets. A year later, "A Charlie Brown Christmas" became the first special to feature characters from the "Peanuts" comic strip. Rankin/Bass produced other animated classics, including 1968's "The Little Drummer Boy" and 1969's "Frosty the Snowman," which was drawn by hand.
But it is "How the Grinch Stole Christmas!" that has had the most vibrant life, in part because of its secular message of togetherness. It tells the story of a furry, green beast who dressed as Santa Claus in a bid to scuttle Christmas in the village of Whoville. Despite his best efforts, the villagers prevailed and embraced him, particularly Cindy Lou Who, who caught the beast trying to stuff her family's Christmas tree up a chimney.
Illustrated with spare line drawings, the book left much to the imagination. Not so with later movies. In 2000, Jim Carrey starred in a Technicolor extravaganza in which the characters seemed as wobbly as the story itself. The Times critic Stephen Holden described the movie then as "a depressing reminder that when Hollywood decides to lavish more than $ 100 million on a beloved children's story, that money has to go somewhere."
He called Mr. Carrey, who starred as the Grinch, "relentless." Worse, he wrote, there were the over-the-top theatrics. The set, for one, was strung with 52,000 Christmas lights. "The movie is so clogged with kooky gadgetry and special effects and glitter and goo that watching it feels like being gridlocked at Toys 'R' Us during the Christmas rush," Mr. Holden wrote.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The musical version that hit Broadway in 2006 fared a little better with Times critics, but not much. "At about 90 minutes the stage version suffers from a milder case of bloat," Charles Isherwood wrote of the play. He called the musical "pleasing." Still, he scoffed at its consumerist underpinnings. Never mind that the story is grounded in community and good cheer -- the musical adaptation was sponsored by Target.
"That this edifying bit of wisdom is now being promulgated by a retail giant is just one of the merry paradoxes of our age," Mr. Isherwood wrote. "Perhaps the vendors flogging $ 20 Grinch dolls in the theater's aisles were doing so with tongues in cheek."
Last year, Illumination, the makers of the "Despicable Me" franchise, created an animated version of "How the Grinch Stole Christmas!" This time, critics were more forgiving. There was little talk of consumerism. The Grinch's dog, Max, had charm. Mostly, though, the film, which starred Benedict Cumberbatch as the Grinch, was described as bland.
Nothing, it seemed, would compare to the 1966 television special. Or, as Mr. Isherwood put it back in 2006, "If there is a more wholly satisfying half-hour of entertainment to be had in our dark world, I'd like to know what it is."

Texto completo: A black-and-white video that depicts the apparent abduction of an Arlington High School student in the Bronx Monday night ignited a frenzy of police activity and garnered national attention on Tuesday morning.
However, 16-year-old Karol Sanchez was found Tuesday afternoon in the Bronx safe and unharmed, Rodney Harrison, chief of the NYPD detectives department, announced on Twitter.
And, the incident took another turn Tuesday evening, when multiple news organizations, including the New York Times, New York Post, New York Daily News and CBS New York, reported the 16-year-old admitted to staging the abduction, citing unnamed police sources.
The reports capped a confusing 24 hours in which Sanchez gained widespread sympathy and concern on social media, only to face questions regarding the validity of the incident.
Footage of the incident was released by authorities Tuesday, which spread quickly online, and an Amber alert was sent. The grainy, black-and-white footage depicts Sanchez walking with her mother. Several men in a beige sedan arrive and a struggle ensured. The girl's mother attempted to fight back before being pushed to the ground. Sanchez was then apparently forced into the car and it drove away.
The incident at 745 Eagle Ave. in the Bronx was reported at around 11:30 p.m. Monday. The Amber alert was issued Tuesday morning around 10:40 a.m. Four men in total were believed to have been involved in what appeared to be a kidnapping, with two men in the car, police said.
Brendan Lyons, superintendent of Arlington Central School District, said Sanchez is a sophomore at the high school.
"We are so relieved that she has been found safe and are ready to support her and her family when she returns to school," Lyons said in the afternoon.
The circumstances of her return were unclear, and an investigation is ongoing.
Information from the Associated Press was used in this report.

“They Painted Over Problems”: How Residents of One Affordable Housing Complex Went From Hope to Despair

CHICAGO — Two decades ago, the Chicago Community Development Corp. rescued a run-down affordable housing apartment complex from the verge of foreclosure and promised tenants conditions would improve.
It was the kind of promise that low-income residents across the country often hear. But in this case, it seemed different. The company and its founder, Anthony Fusco, were the subject of numerous newspaper articles that hailed their work buying buildings like this one, renegotiating contracts with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, and saving more than 2,000 apartment units in the process. A New York Times headline referred to one such building as a “Cinderella.”
“I was very hopeful,” said Samuel Douglas, a longtime resident of the Barbara Jean Wright Courts apartment complex in the Near West Side.
Shortly after acquiring Barbara Jean Wright Courts in 1999, CCDC spent about $6.5 million renovating it, paid in large part by tax-exempt bonds and proceeds from federal low-income housing tax credits, the primary source of funding in the U.S. for affordable housing development.
Fusco, who remains the company’s president, said the renovation work included new roofs, new paint and carpet, upgraded kitchens, and the installation of windows and skylights in common areas and stairwells, among other improvements.
But 20 years later, the property has deteriorated and is in need of a multimillion-dollar renovation. Tenants like Douglas say they feel let down.
Barbara Jean Wright Courts is one of about 820 apartment complexes in Illinois that have entered into contracts with HUD to provide housing to low-income families. The buildings operate much like public housing, except that their owners are private for-profit and nonprofit landlords.
Nationally, more than 1.3 million households rely on these apartments. They can be found in cities throughout Illinois, from Carbondale to Chicago.
But as Barbara Jean Wright Courts illustrates, many of these aging buildings face financial and management challenges much like their public housing counterparts.
Look Up a Publicly Subsidized Housing Unit
HUD Inspect: See if Publicly Subsidized Housing Units Passed or Failed Government Inspections
Across the country, publicly subsidized housing residents have discovered that passing scores on HUD inspections often don't match the reality of their living conditions. Look up housing complex scores near you.
Congress put a halt to HUD issuing new project-based Section 8 contracts like the one HUD holds with Barbara Jean Wright Courts in 1983, about a decade after the program began. At that point, federal lawmakers decided to devote more funding to portable vouchers that subsidize rental costs in the private market, rather than tying subsidies to specific buildings. But it can be a challenge for voucher holders to find landlords who will accept them.
Privately owned and managed buildings receiving HUD subsidies became even more critical in Chicago after the city began tearing down high-rise public housing complexes like the notorious Cabrini-Green and Robert Taylor homes in the 1990s. Chicago is a high-cost city with diminished rental options for people in poverty.
The problems that plagued Chicago’s large public housing complexes haven’t gone away; they have simply shifted, according to Philip DeVon, an eviction prevention specialist with the Metropolitan Tenants Organization, an advocacy organization that supports low-income families.
“It’s a false and misleading narrative that public housing doesn’t work and the private sector does it better,” he said. DeVon said these programs work when affordable apartments, regardless of ownership, are available in neighborhoods where residents can easily access transportation, grocery stores, medical care and good schools, and when adequate oversight and funding is provided to ensure they’re maintained properly.
Douglas, the vice president of the Barbara Jean Wright Courts’ tenant association, and other residents say their building suffers from leaky ceilings, mold, infestation, shoddy repairs and a landlord who is slow to respond to their concerns.
Corine Busch, another resident, says the tap water that runs out of her faucets is discolored. She boils it before using it to cook, and she buys bottled water to drink. It’s been that way for at least a year, she said.
“They always said they were going to fix it up and make it look nice,” Jessie Johnson, president of the property’s tenant association, said. “They were going to do this, and they were going to do that. But they never fixed up this property. This property is mice infested. They painted over problems and put down cheap carpet.”
Johnson said the Barbara Jean Wright Courts is in an ideal location compared with other HUD-subsidized apartment complexes. It’s adjacent to the University of Illinois at Chicago campus and surrounded by gentrifying areas, including Little Italy just to the north, the West Loop to the northeast, Maxwell Street to the east and Pilsen to the south. Johnson said she fears where she’ll end up if she’s forced to find a new apartment with a voucher.
Jessie Johnson, president of the Barbara Jean Wright Courts’ tenant association. Johnson says the apartment complex is infested with mice.
Fusco disagreed with the tenants’ assessment of the property, but he acknowledged that “due to the passage of time,” the property is in need of millions of dollars in repairs and renovations. Fusco said he’s been working for about three years to find a reputable buyer for this and other properties in his portfolio. “I’m 71 years old, and I’m not in a position” to refinance the property, he said.
CCDC plans to sell it for $1, with the caveat that it’s preserved as affordable housing. The buyer will assume about $16 million in debt and interest. “Just so you understand, I’m not in this for the money,” Fusco added.
Tenants say they had not been informed of Fusco’s plans. Johnson said tenants tried for months last year to set up a meeting with Fusco — to no avail.
The tenants said they also tried without success to get HUD’s attention. HUD’s multifamily office in Chicago, which oversees properties like this one, is led by Dan Burke, who worked for years with Fusco as his vice president at CCDC; he left the organization 11 years ago.
Leah Levinger, executive director of the Chicago Housing Initiative, sent an email to Burke in June 2018 asking for a meeting. Burke wrote back that he is “recused from matters regarding Barbara Jean Wright Courts Apartments” and directed communication to an employee who works under him. But Levinger said that two other HUD employees didn’t return multiple messages over the course of months to arrange a meeting, either. “I’ve been doing this for 15 years, and this is one of the worst buildings I’ve seen,” she said.
HUD spokesman Jereon Brown said that Burke recused himself in 2018 from meeting with tenants about property conditions “as an exercise of caution and in order to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest,” though he wasn’t required to do so by law.
But relief is still a long way off. A closing has been delayed by the complexity of the deal.
The building’s finances are propped up by several layers of government programs, each with its own requirements.
About $6.9 million in debt on the property dates back to when the building was constructed in the early 1970s under a new federal program that provided incentives for private companies to build and manage housing for America’s poorest families. Fusco said the program set owners up to fail because it didn’t give them enough operating revenue to manage the buildings properly. In 1988, when CCDC was created, many properties nationally were facing foreclosure and were at risk of losing their affordability status. HUD agreed to suspend payments on its loan when CCDC purchased the property so that it could invest more money into renovations.
Today, only about 40% of the property’s 272 units are covered by a project-based Section 8 contract with HUD. Under this program, tenants pay about a third of their income toward rent costs, and HUD subsidizes the rest up to an established amount. The amount of rent CCDC can charge at the property’s other 166 units is also restricted because of the company’s use of low-income housing tax credits for the renovation work. That squeezes revenue.
Jonathan Rose Companies recently told tenants that it will likely be near the end of 2020 before the property changes hands, Levinger said.
Nathan Taft, a partner with Jonathan Rose Companies, said his company is committed to acquiring and renovating the property, and maintaining it as affordable housing. The firm has experience in overcoming complex deals like this one, he said. When the HUD-held loan is paid off, there is a potential to increase the subsidy amount the property receives from HUD, which would help support the renovation and shore up its financial condition, Taft said.

Texto completo: The fate of the republic hangs in the balance, but there’s nothing I can do about it today. So let’s have a bit of escapism, econogeek style.
I suspect that long-time readers won’t be surprised to learn that I’m a big fan of the TV series “The Expanse,” which was on Syfy for three seasons, canceled, but picked up by Amazon. Actually, the series seems to be a favorite of many social scientists, like international relations expert turned part time pundit Dan Drezner. Linguists love the carefully designed creole spoken by the Belters, who live on various asteroids.
Warning: I’m most of the way through the fourth season, and what follows will include slight spoilers, although probably not enough to matter.
Anyway, Drezner is enjoying the show’s take on interplanetary diplomacy, with the three-cornered cold war among Earth (which seems somehow to have acquired a world government, with the secretary-general of the United Nations the most powerful person on the planet), the Martian Congressional Republic, and the Belters.
If you ask me, the show also deserved a place in Aisha Harris’ article on the “new pop culture optimism.” The 23rd century is full of greed and violence, much of it perpetrated by evil corporations; but it appears to be colorblind, gender-neutral, and LGBTQ-tolerant. There’s an interracial romance at the show’s core, multiple strong women (Avasarala! Bobbie Draper! Drummer!) and a key positive role played by Pastor Anna, who’s married to another woman.
But enough about humanity. Let’s talk about macroeconomics!
Earth appears to be suffering from mass technological unemployment. Half the population is unemployed and living on Basic, which apparently consists of in-kind provision of housing, food, and other necessities. (Kind of like a global version of Trump’s idea of replacing food stamps with food boxes.)
But are robots really the problem? For the first three seasons, Mars stands in stark contrast. It’s a mobilized, full-employment society where everyone is working either on supporting a military strong enough to stand up to Earth or on the long-term goal of terraforming the planet, making it suitable for humans.
Over the course of Season Three, however, the cold war was (mostly) resolved, while the protomolecule (don’t ask) seemed to have opened access to hundreds of habitable planets, making terraforming Mars seem pointless. And in Season Four, Martian society is in deep trouble. Unemployment is rife thanks to the winding down of both military spending and terraforming, with some ex-military Martians who can’t find jobs turning to crime.
So, my question: If Earth has mass unemployment because robots can do stuff, making human workers unnecessary, what were all those fully employed Martians doing?
In fact, the emergence of high unemployment on Mars after demobilization and the end of terraforming makes it seem as if the real problem wasn’t technology, it was secular stagnation — a situation in which private spending is consistently too weak to employ the economy’s resources, except during unsustainable asset or debt bubbles. Japan has been suffering from secular stagnation since the 1990s; a number of economists, myself included, believe that the whole advanced world now has much the same problem.
What’s the solution to secular stagnation? The answer, according to people like Larry Summers, is a big increase in public spending on infrastructure: roads, bridges, ports, and, if you happen to live on a planet without breathable air, terraforming.
The point is that when you’re in a secular stagnation economy, virtue is vice, prudence is folly, and good news can be bad. Even wasteful government spending can be a helpful stimulus. Before the outbreak of peace, Mars was a healthy society because it had a grand project; when that grand project became unnecessary, instead of freeing up resources to do other things, things got much worse.
So “The Expanse” is basically a show about the need for higher public investment. Well, and also monsters, alien technology, and space Mormons.
We now return you to your regularly scheduled 21st-century doom and gloom.

Texto completo: OLIVESBURG, OHIO – For Sam Donohue, philanthropy started early.
The son of Crestview graduates Sean and Molly Donohue, the 5-year-old came up with the idea to have a drive for socks for needy children.
His idea blew up more than his parents could have imagined. The drive led to the donation of 619 pairs of socks, 80 hats and 121 pairs of gloves. People also contributed three earmuffs, three headbands, a pair of shoes, a fleece jacket and a scarf.
"It kind of spread, which was really awesome," Molly Donohue said. "It got exciting for us as parents."
The idea came from the children's book "What Do You Do with an Idea," a New York Times bestseller.
"You change the world," Donohue said. "It's kind of a lot for a 5-year-old. We tried to make it make more sense to him.
"We could help other people. Socks and warm things are not something everybody has. It started very small."
It grew very big.
Donohue's mother, Joyce Brennan, shared the idea with her garden club.
"They did a huge collection," Donohue said.
A neighbor – the Donohues live in Akron – donated 200 pairs of socks. Sean Donohue mentioned the drive at his workplace.
Because of the huge haul, the Donohues divided the donations between Crestview and Akron City Schools, where Sam is in preschool.
"It was all going to be for Crestview," Molly Donohue said. "I wanted to give back. Our roots go back to Crestview."
Molly graduated in 1999, while her husband graduated in 1998.
She and Sam took the items to Crestview Elementary School early last week, coordinating with school counselor Taylor White.
"We have a lot of students that come in without gloves or hats," she said.
White gave socks to a boy whose family had recently moved. She said she was impressed with Sam's initiative.
"It was very unexpected that a 5-year-old had the idea," White said. "It was very much appreciated."
Donohue also has a niece who is in the first grade at Crestview.
One of the family's neighbors bought the book "What Do You Do with an Idea?" for Sam and asked him to pick another child he thought would have good ideas to change the world.
"Pretty cool," Donohue said.
According to amazon.com, "What Do You Do With an Idea?" is for anyone who's ever had a big idea.
It's the story of one brilliant idea and the child who helps to bring it into the world. As the child's confidence grows, so does the idea itself. And then, one day, something amazing happens.
Amazon.com says it is a story for anyone, at any age, who's ever had an idea that seemed a little too big, too odd, too difficult. It's a story to inspire you to welcome that idea, to give it some space to grow and to see what happens next. Because your idea isn't going anywhere. In fact, it's just getting started.
Donohue said she and her husband try to give back, noting the Ronald McDonald House is one of their favorite charities.
She is challenging News Journal readers to keep the idea going on their own. She wants the same for Sam.
"I'm hoping that this continues his whole life," Donohue said.
Sam Donohue, 5, started a sock drive for needy kids that ended up with nearly 600 donated pairs.

Texto completo: Billionaire philanthropist Ronald Lauder is funding a $25 million campaign against political candidates in the United States who support or normalize anti-Semitism.
Lauder, the president of the World Jewish Congress, announced the new campaign, called the Anti-Semitism Accountability Project, or ASAP. The effort will include a nonprofit organization and a super PAC.
Lauder will have the final say on which politicians - federal, state and local - will be targeted for defeat, according to The New York Times.
He is a longtime Republican donor, but Lauder told the newspaper he planned to use the organization to go after both Democrats and Republicans who traffic in anti-Semitic language and tropes.
A statement announcing the launch of ASAP said it would "also respond and take action against institutions and cultural figures who support anti-Semitism." Lauder also told The Times that he would look into universities and their professors, and pressure them to stop anti-Semitic statements and actions by contacting major donors.
ASAP will partner with existing organizations that are working across the country to combat anti-Semitism, the statement said, and encouraged contact from those groups through its website.
The launch comes in response to a documented surge in anti-Semitism across America, according to the statement. According to a poll commissioned by ASAP and conducted by Douglass Schoen of Schoen Consulting, anti-Semitism has doubled over the past five years. Today, 14 percent of Americans hold anti-Semitic beliefs, as compared to 7 percent from a survey released by the Anti-Defamation League in 2014.
The poll used the definition of anti-Semitism of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance.
Lauder told The Times that he has hired teams of researchers to follow political races across the country "from the most local to the major ones" to track anti-Semitic comments.

Texto completo: For your holiday gift search, here are some of the year's more insightful, inspiring and infinitely coolest books on sports:
"Dreamers and Schemers: How an Improbable Bid for the 1932 Olympics Transformed Los Angeles From Dusty Outpost to Global Metropolis," by Barry Siegel (UC Press, $29.95, 272 pages)
Giving context to the magic we experienced during L.A.'s Summer Games of 1984 and what we anticipate for 2028, this tale about real estate baron Billy Garland laying the groundwork in the early 1920s and pushing through the Great Depression to give the city a global identity might consider the soundtrack to "The Music Man" playing in the background. No revisionist history here, just the foundation of a Hollywood screenplay based on Siegel's dogged research.

"Canyon Dreams: A Basketball Season on the Navajo Nation," by Michael Powell (Blue Rider Press, $28, 272 pages)
A recent NPR piece compares this to how Buzz Bissinger's "Friday Night Lights" spotlighted the influence of prep football. But the buzz generating for this New York Times sportswriter's exquisite framing of the Chinle High Wildcats of the Navajo Nation in the badlands of northeastern Arizona makes us want to see "rez ball" up close. It's basketball that values a hockey-like concept of subbing groups in and out, focused on intricate teamwork, with a deeper meaning for the man coaching it who battles his own season on the brink.
"Surf Like a Girl," by Carolina Amell (Prestel Publishing, $50, 256 pages)
Some call themselves "surfragettes," and live by mottoes such as "Happiness comes in waves" and "All we need is vitamin sea." In "The Endless Summer" meets "Gidget" for a global girl tour, a stunningly gorgeous collection of photos and text may be best represented by portraits of the Arugam Bay Girls Surf Club of Sri Lanka. It's testament to how the sport continues to evolve as an equal-opportunity challenge of nature and mover of boundaries. Amell, a graphic designer from Barcelona, Spain, also channels the karma of photographers such as Maria Fernanda, Cecilia Thibier, Camille Robiou du Pont, Sara Guix, Ming Nomchong and Amber Jones.
"State: A Team, a Triumph, a Transformation," by Melissa Isaacson (Agate Midway, $27, 320 pages)
Isaacson, the longtime sportswriter now on the faculty of Northwestern Medill, expands on a piece she did 15 years ago for the Chicago Tribune about her experience as a 1970s basketball player at Niles West High in suburban Chicago. In the opening yawns of how Title IX was supposed to work, this team takes up the challenges and ramifications of gender equality and comes out with a deeper appreciation of its 1979 state championship.
"Jumbotron Art: Baseball Portraits," by Peter Chen (self-published, $34.99, 140 pages, at www.jumbotronart.com)
Torrance-based graphic artist Peter Chen has created so many nostalgic portraits of MLB players from the '70s and '80s who once had their faces depicted on those state-of-the-art Lite-Brite scoreboard stadium screens, he expands it with an enlightening book. There are more than 900 glowing faces -- see how many of them you can guess (yes, that's Charlie Sheen on the cover as "Wild Thing").
" Reflection," by Tyler Lockett (Andrews McMeel Publishing, $14.99, 112 pages)
After the Seattle Seahawks receiver talked about his poetry on a recent "Monday Night Football" pregame show, Amazon sales pushed this into the online bookseller's Top 50. It ranks No. 1 in the football genre and No. 2 in inspirational and religious poetry.
"Curveball: How I Discovered True Fulfillment After Chasing Fortune and Fame, " by Barry Zito (with Robert Noland, Thomas Nelson Publishing, $26.99, 272 pages)
Maybe a cautionary tale to pitchers like Stephen Strasburg and Gerrit Cole from a fellow Southern Californian who didn't want his seven-year, $126-million deal with the San Francisco Giants in 2007 to continue to define him. What is success? Finding your true self.
"The Grim Reaper: The Life and Career of a Reluctant Warrior," by Stu Grimson with Kevin Allen (Viking Books, $27, 352 pages)
"Teemu Selanne: My Life," by Teemu Selanne with Ari Mennander (Triumph Books, $28, 320 pages)
We've wondered how Stu Grimson's career might have been different had he been named Zarley Zalapski, Ben Lovejoy or Pierre-Luc Letourneau-Leblond (all real NHL players). Instead, the former Duck (1993-95; 1998-2000) and King (2000-01) punched his way through with a dubious nickname knuckled under by a 14-year career defined by 2,113 penalty minutes in 729 games (versus 17 goals and 22 assists). Then the 6-foot-6 winger retired, became a born-again Christian, got a law degree and was an in-house counsel for the NHLPA.
With Selanne, his bio is already a bestseller in Finland and now available in English. The Ducks' anchor to their 2007 Stanley Cup title reveals hurdles he had to skate around to become the NHL star that all those in Helsinki expected of him.
An interesting link to both players is Paul Kariya, who writes the foreword to Grimson's book ("I always looked up to Stu for the man and player he was") and was an integral force in Selanne's career.
When does Kariya finally write his own yarn?

Texto completo: Women do so much less often. And it's not because their work isn't as good.
Women are underrepresented in science, technology, engineering and mathematics at the highest levels. Only one out of four full professors at American research institutions is a woman, despite the fact that equal numbers of men and women earn doctoral degrees in science each year. In the life sciences, women are less likely either to receive major grant funding or to be promoted to full professor -- and they are paid less even when they produce the same amount of scholarly output as men.
We've identified another, much less discussed component of gender disparity in science: Men are much more likely than women to heap praise on their own research and emphasize its importance.
In a study published in The British Medical Journal, we analyzed the titles and abstracts of more than six million life science articles. We suspected that scientific teams led by men might frame their research findings in more flattering light, by using terms like "novel," "excellent" and "unique" to describe their results.
Indeed, they do. In the most highly cited scientific journals, male-led scientific teams were up to 21 percent more likely than women-led teams publishing comparable studies to use positive adjectives to frame their research findings.
That matters. Scientists use titles and abstracts to screen articles, to decide what to read. Positive presentation of research findings by male scientists may then draw more attention from others in the scientific community. Sure enough, we found that the greater use of positive spin by male-led teams was linked to more citations.
Since citations to scientific research often serve as a key metric in hiring, promotion, pay and funding decisions, these differences in self-promotion may also translate into gender disparities on many levels.
Our analysis accounted for several factors that might reasonably justify the positive framing of research findings by male scientists. For example, if male scientists disproportionately did research in newer scientific areas, the greater use of positive terms to describe their research might make sense.
But we found no evidence that male scientists' more frequent use of spin stemmed from their science being more novel or innovative.
It's well recognized that men and women use language differently. Some studies in the general population suggest that men use more assertive language and women more tentative language when communicating.
Studies in the sciences have reached similar conclusions. A textual analysis of approximately 7,000 research grant proposals to the Gates Foundation found that despite grant reviewers not knowing the identity of the applicant, women received lower application scores. The gap could be explained entirely by the gender differences in how applicants framed their research.
There are still unanswered questions: Do women choose to refrain from presenting their research more positively, or are they held to different standards by reviewers and editors who govern the scientific peer review process? Our research, of course, cannot determine the best amount of positive framing for research. But it does raise questions the scientific community -- both men and women -- may need to reflect on.
Across most occupations, the way in which individuals "sell" themselves to others is one factor in advancement. Although we focused on scientists, our findings shed new light on how men and women stake claims about accomplishments, scientific or otherwise, and how those differences might combine with other forms of gender inequality to influence career outcomes.

Texto completo: We need a broad national effort to recruit volunteers to educate and counsel the incarcerated.
Decades after the prison population began its growth surge, criminal justice reform has finally moved into the national conversation.
Last December, President Trump signed the First Step Act, reducing federal prison sentences. Democratic presidential candidates are proposing far-reaching reforms on bail, sentencing, punishments for drug-related crimes and voting rights for incarcerated Americans. New York City is set to close its notorious jail complex on Rikers Island. And Philadelphia, Chicago and other major cities have elected progressive district attorneys.
Unfortunately, what happens inside the walls of the nation's prisons has not changed at all. They can be stifling in summer and freezing in winter. The residents are often belittled, abused and cut off from anything resembling rehabilitation. Constitutional protections are virtually nonexistent; solitary confinement, to pick one example, is considered torture by much of the world, but is business as usual inside America's state and federal jails and prisons, home to roughly 2.1 million people.
Here is what the next president, or President Trump, can do to reform mass incarceration: Open up this hidden world to the public. I call my proposal "Let Us In."
The public should see firsthand the conditions within the walls, meet the men and women who reside in our prisons, look them in the eye, shake their hands and teach them skills they can use once they are released. After all, 90 percent of them will end up back among us.
Recent college graduates should receive stipends to teach prisoners languishing with few opportunities for instruction in math or history. Retired schoolteachers could teach literature or science classes. Local college students could receive credit for prison work. And people released from prison should be invited back to tell the men and women they left behind about life on the outside.
Yes, some prisons already have programs that allow outsiders inside the walls for teaching and counseling. But there aren't enough of them. What I'm talking about is a thorough effort to bring down the wall separating the incarcerated and the free. Let Us In could change the relationship between the public and the imprisoned. Like President John F. Kennedy's Peace Corps, it could inspire a generation of Americans to engage in the betterment of our fragile world.
This is how it would work.
First, the president would state clearly that mass incarceration is a failed system. It created, in the words of Michelle Alexander, author of "The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness," a "racial caste system" that has disproportionately punished a generation of young, usually male, people of color. The president must speak to people's pain, and acknowledge that we imprison too many people for too long, and at a cost to taxpayers of billions of dollars a year.
Because only 10 percent of incarcerated Americans are in federal custody, the president has limited scope for shrinking the prison population. What the president can do is use the office as a bully pulpit to change the criminal justice narrative, and to adopt what "Reimagining Justice," a report by the Vera Institute of Justice, proposes: a policy of incarceration whose "foundational value" is "human dignity."
To that end, the president would assemble a diverse group of criminal justice experts -- including corrections and law enforcement officials, former inmates and their families, defense lawyers, judges and inmate advocates -- to develop a national program to create paths for trained volunteers and professionals to work inside prisons wherever safety allows.
Let Us In must be more than "tourism within walls"; for the volunteers to be able to go inside the walls to dispense their skills and knowledge, serious consideration must be given to training and safety.
Within two years, the organization could be spun off from the government, and a nonprofit corporation would take its place. Imagine former Presidents George Bush and Barack Obama as honorary chairmen. Eventually, the program would be financed by a combination of government grants and nonprofit contributions, much like the Corporation for Public Broadcasting or Americorp's Vista program.
I've already witnessed the power of such programs on a smaller scale. At Green Haven and Fishkill Correctional Facilities in New York, I watched theatrical performances by incarcerated men sponsored by Rehabilitation Through the Arts. At San Quentin State Prison in California, I met with the prison newspaper's staff and attended a finance class led by a self-taught instructor serving a life sentence. While visiting the Osborne Association's parenting program at Sing Sing prison in Osborne, N.Y., with a group of family court judges, I witnessed incarcerated men plead for visitation privileges with their children. "When I see you men taking these programs, I know you are serious," said one judge.
I've met graduates and instructors from Bard and Bennington Colleges' degree programs in prisons. And at my organization, The Marshall Project, two members of our staff received degrees from Mercy College while in prison through the Hudson Link Program for Higher Education in Prison, which provides college education in prison.
Several years ago, I was at San Quentin to participate in a series of TEDx talks. I invited an editor friend who lived nearby. He sat next to an incarcerated man who worked on San Quentin's magazine, and he invited my friend to help as a volunteer. For the next two years, my friend went twice a week to San Quentin to help the staff publish their magazine. "This was a life-changing experience," he told me.
As inspiring as these programs may be, they aren't enough to meet the monumental need. Each year, 3,000 volunteers pass through the doors of San Quentin, in densely populated and liberal Marin County, offering everything from yoga to computer training to psychotherapy classes. But in many prisons around the country, particularly those in remote locales, volunteers can be hard to come by.
Let Us In must not be a substitute for more difficult prison reforms. The bail, sentencing, policing and parole systems still cry out for radical changes, and reform efforts will require a deliberate, state-by-state process.
But, if executed properly, Let Us In would achieve several goals at once.
It will provide tools for the incarcerated to lead healthy, productive lives once they leave prison. It is shameful that they are often released as damaged men and women, with few skills to cope in society. Educational and other programs offer incentives for the incarcerated, which enlightened superintendents will embrace.
And finally, Let Us In would create a generation of prison reform proponents -- volunteers who will take their experiences back to their communities, who will vote and who will one day employ the formerly incarcerated when they rejoin their communities.
The civil rights lawyer Bryan Stevenson says there are four things necessary to confront injustice in America: getting close to the issue, changing the narrative, fighting hopelessness and getting uncomfortable.
Let Us In will go a long way toward achieving these goals, and it would hold participating institutions accountable to the citizens who routinely pass through its doors.
It might also make the rest of us a little uncomfortable. And that's O.K. too.

Texto completo: A Times investigation showed how oligarchs and political patrons make millions in farm subsidies. But the program is all but sacrosanct.
BRUSSELS -- European Union lawmakers on Tuesday strongly criticized corruption and self-dealing in the bloc's $ 65-billion-a-year farm subsidy program but were sharply divided over how or whether to reform a system that has become a third rail of European politics.
At a time of festering anti-European sentiment, the debate over one of the world's largest subsidy programs highlighted a fissure that cuts far deeper than a simple dispute over farm policy. It raised the question of how to combat political corruption without infringing on the independence of the bloc's 28 nations -- and further emboldening its far-right populist critics.
Tuesday's debate happened during a European Parliament budget oversight hearing, which was prompted, in part, by a New York Times investigation into the farm subsidy program, known as the Common Agricultural Policy or C.A.P. In November, the Times revealed how subsidies help underwrite oligarchs, enrich politicians and encourage land-grabbing and Mafia-style tactics.
"The recent New York Times report on the abuse of C.A.P. subsidies is damning and undermines trust in government," said Mick Wallace, a European lawmaker from Ireland.
The Times tracked state land sales and subsidies that benefited friends and family members of Hungary's prime minister, Viktor Orban, while also identifying at least $ 79 million in government subsidies paid to companies owned by the Andrej Babis, prime minister of the Czech Republic.
"It quite ironic to see populists such as Andrej Babis and Viktor Orban making such hue and cry about how European Union money is spent, while the same two people use E.U. money to enrich their friends," said Lara Wolters, a lawmaker from the Netherlands and member of the budget oversight committee.
In the hearing, Ms. Wolters argued that Parliament should reconsider the core premise of the subsidy program -- that farmers are paid based on how much land they control.
Such a change would curb the ability of national leaders to use farmland as political chits. And it could reduce the incentives for large, politically powerful companies to acquire more land. But it would also amount to a seismic overhaul of a fund regarded as sacrosanct by many national politicians and many farmers.
European lawmakers are now debating the renewal of the bloc's next seven-year farm bill. National leaders want more discretion on how to spend the money, and farmers want fewer administrative requirements. In Brussels, there is little appetite for a major reform that would impose greater oversight on governments -- even those that have manipulated or abused the system.
So the latest proposal, which will be debated in the coming months, gives national leaders like Mr. Babis and Mr. Orban even greater power to set farm policy and oversee spending, despite allegations of corruption. Internal auditors have criticized that proposal, and several lawmakers objected Tuesday.
"We can't even adequately police corruption," said Sheila Ritchie of Scotland. "What on Earth makes us think self-policing compliance is going to work?"
Johannes Hahn, the European budget administrator, defended the bloc's approach to corruption and abuse, noting that European auditors have investigated and audited Mr. Babis.
"We have reacted very quickly," he said.
But the Babis investigations also reveal how accountability is still limited. Years ago, European investigators recommended that Mr. Babis be charged with fraud, but they lack jurisdiction or authority to bring charges. The case has languished in the Czech Republic. And the audit is expected to drag on for many months, during which time Mr. Babis can still vote on the European budget.
The European Union is not a government but an economic and political bloc. While it has a system of shared laws, the union is built on the concept of national sovereignty.
Those tensions bubbled over on Tuesday, as some lawmakers strongly rejected suggestions that cracking down on corruption required the European Union to take on new oversight.
"Some colleagues want the E.U. to have even greater responsibilities and to supervise member states even more," Tomislav Sokol, a Croatian lawmaker, said during the hearing, held in Strasbourg, France. "But member states should look after their own interests. Solutions should not be imposed by the European Union."
The clearest divisions, though, were between lawmakers calling for a significant overhaul of the subsidy program and those who argued for keeping it intact.
"The story here isn't actually about a few bad apples robbing funds," said Clare Daly, an Irish lawmaker. "The problem is actually the system itself."
Such sentiments elicited a rebuke from Clara Aguilera of Spain, who is also a member of the agricultural committee.
"There are people who are trying to make these problems into a general condemnation of the C.A.P.," she said. "I refuse to join in this blanket condemnation."

Texto completo: Two albums by Juice WRLD jumped up the chart after the singing rapper's death on Dec. 8.
Roddy Ricch, a 21-year-old rapper from Compton, Calif., has topped the latest Billboard album chart, beating out the newest LPs from the Who and Camila Cabello, while news of the death of Juice WRLD sent his two albums back to the Top 10.
Ricch's "Please Excuse Me for Being Antisocial," his first studio album, opened at No. 1 with the equivalent of 101,000 sales in the United States, according to Nielsen. The vast majority of that total was from streaming, with songs from the album being played almost 131 million times; just 3,000 copies of "Please Excuse Me" were sold as a complete package.
Also this week, "Who," the latest from the Who, opened at No. 2, the band's best chart position since "Who Are You" in 1978, which also went to No. 2. "Who" was credited with 89,000 sales, most of which were made as part of a deal bundling it with tickets to the band's latest tour.
Cabello's second album, "Romance," opened at No. 3, while Post Malone's "Hollywood's Bleeding" fell two spots to No. 4.
"Bad Vibes Forever," a posthumous album by the rapper XXXTentacion, who was killed in June 2018, opened at No. 5, while two albums by Juice WRLD returned to the Top 10: "Goodbye & Good Riddance" rose 65 spots to No. 6, and "Death Race for Love" climbed 78 to No. 10.
The soundtrack to "Frozen 2," last week's top seller, fell to No. 7.
And on the Hot 100 singles chart, Mariah Carey's "All I Want for Christmas Is You" completed the longest-ever trip to No. 1, reaching the top 25 years after its release.

Texto completo: The letter was a diatribe that played loose with facts and sometimes disregarded them outright. A former Clinton aide called it a reflection of the president's "id."
WASHINGTON -- The letter read like a Twitter tirade published on White House stationery. The words ran together with the cadence of a Trump rally script, just before the president veers from the teleprompter. The accusations, untruths and wayward exclamation points piled up by the paragraph.
"You have cheapened the importance of the very ugly word, impeachment!" President Trump wrote in the letter to Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday. "By proceeding with your invalid impeachment, you are violating your oaths of office, you are breaking your allegiance to the Constitution, and you are declaring open war on American Democracy."
Five and a half pages long, signed in Sharpie and sent the afternoon before the House of Representatives was due to impeach him for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, the letter officially underscored -- for the "permanent and indelible record" -- how angry he had become over the prospect of becoming only the third president in history to have this happen to him.
Multiple aides said on Tuesday that the president wanted the letter to be written because he wanted to get some things off his chest. By letter's end, he seemed to have gotten rid of all of them.
Extensive in its grievances and laced with different words for what he perceives the House is about to do to him and what its reason is for doing it -- such as "assault," "destruction" and "derangement" -- the letter was a rambling diatribe that played loose with facts, sometimes disregarding them outright.
As Mr. Trump laid out a case for his belief that the Democrats have been engaged in an unlawful crusade to end his presidency, he repeated his erroneous contention that a "so-called whistle-blower" had "started this entire hoax with a false report of the phone call that bears no relationship to the actual phone call that was made."
Even his historical analogies were problematic. Comparing impeachment to the Salem witch trials, Mr. Trump claimed that the Massachusetts women accused of witchcraft in the 1690s were treated to "more due process" than he was afforded during the inquiry. (Definitely not true.)
In an impeachment inquiry marked by reams of emphatic, eloquent and often emotional testimonies written by lawyers, Foreign Service officers and Purple Heart recipients, Mr. Trump's letter stands out for how much it sounds like an unvarnished version of its signer: off the cuff, angry and ready to make an expletive-laden case against impeachment.
The White House has tried in recent days to focus on Mr. Trump's accomplishments as president, but he framed his record in the context of his own victimhood.
"There are not many people who could have taken the punishment inflicted during this period of time, and yet done so much for the success of America and its citizens," Mr. Trump wrote.
Some of the president's closest advisers were involved in drafting the letter, but they did not include Pat A. Cipollone, the White House counsel who will play a large role in a Senate trial.
Instead, Eric Ueland, the director of the Office of Legislative Affairs, led the process, with input from Stephen Miller, the president's top policy adviser, who often scripts many of Mr. Trump's public remarks. Michael Williams, an adviser to Mick Mulvaney, the president's acting chief of staff, also weighed in, and Mr. Ueland's draft was framed over the last few days.
Former presidential advisers said documents like these were always a reflection of the person in charge. To them it seemed clear that, on the eve of impeachment, Mr. Trump was interested in speaking only to his base.
"There just doesn't seem to be a lot of strategy," said David Litt, a former speechwriter for President Barack Obama. "Nothing here suggests that he's trying to talk to someone who is trying to make up his or her mind" on impeachment.
Michael Waldman, who served as a policy aide and speechwriter to President Bill Clinton during his impeachment, called the letter "a six-page screech" and said it was a representation of Mr. Trump's "id."
"Typically a president's words are weighed very carefully, especially at a moment of constitutional significance," Mr. Waldman said. "This just seemed to be a chance to change the news stories for a few hours and get it off his chest."
On the other side of a sharply partisan lens that has divided Washington, Mr. Trump's Republican allies in Congress felt differently. Representative Dan Meuser of Pennsylvania called the letter "very important" and urged his fellow Pennsylvanians to read it.
"It is a straightforward summary that provides an account of the unfair procedures by Democrat leadership, and the failure to substantiate any impeachable offense," Mr. Meuser wrote. "This letter marks a historic night -- the eve of the Democrats' vote to undermine the American election process."
The president made clear whom he blamed for it -- Ms. Pelosi. He even belittled her for having said she prayed for him, "when you know this statement is not true, unless it is meant in a negative sense."
"It is a terrible thing you are doing," Mr. Trump wrote, "but you will have to live with it, not I!"

Texto completo: Democratic officials are pushing for an end to a labor dispute that threatens the party's sixth presidential primary debate, scheduled for Thursday on a California university campus.
Xochitl Hinojosa, the Democratic National Committee's communications director and a lead debate organizer for DNC chairman Tom Perez, said Monday that Perez “spent the entire weekend" urging stakeholders to engage in good-faith, mediated negotiations. He's seeking a resolution to the dispute between the food services company Sodexo and about 150 of its employees who work on the Loyola Marymount University campus that is scheduled to host the debate.
The seven candidates who have qualified for the debate have all said they would not attend a Loyola debate if the dispute persists, and at least nine candidates in the Democratic race have expressed solidarity with the UNITE HERE Local 11 amid collective bargaining that involves disagreements over wages and health care benefits.
The DNC is not looking for an alternate debate site.
A local union leader said talks with Sodexo could resume Tuesday.
Sodexo spokesman Enrico Dinges said in an e-mail that the company is “100 percent committed" to reaching an agreement and remains at the bargaining table.
UNITE HERE attracted immediate attention last week with its promise to picket Thursday's debate, prompting quick statements from Perez and presidential candidates. Progressive Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont were the first to say they'd boycott the debate. Former vice president Joe Biden; Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg; entrepreneur Andrew Yang; and billionaire activist Tom Steyer followed suit.

President threatens to bypass debate commission
President Trump made clear Monday that he intends to participate in at least three general election debates, but he is threatening to sidestep the nonprofit charged with running them.
“I look very much forward to debating whoever the lucky person is who stumbles across the finish line in the little watched Do Nothing Democrat Debates," Trump tweeted Monday morning after The New York Times reported that he was considering skipping them entirely.
Trump said his record “is so good" that “perhaps I would consider more than 3 debates." But he also complained, without evidence, that the Commission on Presidential Debates is “stacked with Trump Haters & Never Trumpers" and threatened to bypass them.
“As President, the debates are up . . . to me, and there are many options, including doing them directly & avoiding the nasty politics of this very biased Commission," Trump wrote, adding that he would “make a decision at an appropriate time."
Trump tussled with the commission and Fox News about the debates during the 2016 election cycle.
He incorrectly claimed Monday on Twitter that the commission was “forced to publicly apologize for modulating my microphone" in the first general election debate against Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in September 2016.
In a statement, the commission said, “The televised general election debates are an important part of our democratic process." It said the commission has conducted 30 general election presidential and vice presidential debates since 1988.

Judge permits Georgia voter roll purges prior to hearing
A federal judge is allowing Georgia to proceed with a mass purge of its voting rolls planned for Monday evening, but he also scheduled a hearing later in the week to hear more arguments about the matter.
That decision came after a lawyer for the state assured him that if the judge finds later that some people should not have been removed, they can be easily and quickly reinstated.
Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger in October released a list of more than 313,000 voters whose registrations were at risk of being canceled, about 4 percent of the state's total registered voters.
Notices were mailed in November giving those voters 30 days to respond to keep their registration valid. A spokesman for the secretary of state's office said last week that the purge was set to begin Monday evening.
Fair Fight Action, a voting rights group founded by Democrat Stacey Abrams, had filed an emergency request Monday morning asking the court to halt the purge of some people.
US District Judge Steve Jones initially set a hearing on Fair Fight's request for Thursday and said the purge should be placed on hold until then, but he later decided to hold a hearing Monday afternoon at the state's request.

Men get probation for trying to access Trump tax returns
Two men were sentenced Monday to probation and community service for trying to hack the IRS to obtain President Trump's tax returns.
Andrew Harris, 23, of Philadelphia, and Justin Hiemstra, 22, of St. Paul Park, Minn., both previously pleaded guilty to federal charges of computer fraud.
Harris and Hiemstra were students at Haverford College outside Philadelphia in 2016 when they used a school computer lab to open a fraudulent federal financial aid application for an unnamed Trump family member.
The students managed to reset a password and, using Trump's Social Security number and date of birth, repeatedly tried to import Trump's federal tax information into the application, according to court documents.
The Department of Education and IRS detected the attempts.
A federal judge gave each defendant two years' probation and 200 hours of community service.

Minority 2020 candidates are failing because black and Hispanic Democrats prefer the white candidates

Texto completo: Minorities in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary field have struggled since the launch of each of their campaigns to gain any strong, lasting support. There’s only one reason why: They couldn’t get any strong, lasting support from their party’s own voters.
Politico published a story this week that's full of Democrats absurdly blaming racism, and even their national committee, for the fact that the party’s top-tier candidates are all white.
“[Kamala] Harris’ downfall, [Cory] Booker’s struggles and Julián Castro’s single-digit polling,” it said, “have caused Democrats across the party, and especially people of color, to ask what’s led the party to this juncture, where all the frontrunners are white, and most of them are male and in their 70s.”
Rep. Barbara Lee of California faulted “systemic racism,” which, she said, “permeate[s] everything in this country.”
Booker’s campaign manager said: “You have to answer two questions when you're running for president: One is, should you be president and the other is, could you be president. And if you are a white man, you do not have to answer that second question.”
As detailed in my forthcoming book, Privileged Victims: How America’s Culture Fascists Hijacked the Country and Elevated Its Worst People, claims of racial grievance are among the surest ways to secure attentions and rewards in present-day America.
But as the Politico article acknowledged, the issue is actually just a simple matter of math. Blacks and Latinos, for whatever reason, hold a so-far unshakable preference for the two old white men in the race, Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, respectively. Even though the early primary states Iowa and New Hampshire are overwhelmingly made up of white voters, racism doesn’t explain why minorities don't like any of the candidates who share their race and ethnicity.
There’s also the small matter of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, having intentionally seized any attention the candidates were getting and training it almost 24 hours a day on the attempted removal of President Trump from office.
Every candidate has suffered from a dearth of free media since Pelosi launched the impeachment inquiry on Sep. 24 — all except Biden, whose surname and whose son are at the center of the impeachment.

In the week following Pelosi’s announcement, “Biden was mentioned in more cable news clips and online news stories ... than all other 2020 Democratic candidates combined,” according to FiveThirtyEight.
In mid-November, as the immensely boring impeachment hearings dragged on, national support for Harris and Booker, who had already been struggling for traction, began petering out. Numbers for Pete Buttigieg have also suffered.
It was likely not Pelosi’s intention to starve the minority candidates of oxygen, but in her desperate attempt to distract from that freak show of a primary, it was a sad consequence.
In short, if Democrats are looking for someone to blame for the whiteness of their 2020 candidates, they have to start with Pelosi and their party’s voters.

Texto completo: Erica Tishman, arquitecto y vicepresidente de una compañía de gestión de proyectos, murió trágicamente esta mañana al caerle en la cabeza un escombro que se desprendió de un edificio en Midtown West.
La policía dijo que Tishman caminaba por la calle 49 y 7ma avenida , alrededor de las 10:45 a.m., cuando fue golpeada por un trozo de fachada del edificio. Fue declarada muerta en la escena, informó New York Post.
Los registros del edificio de la ciudad muestran que la propiedad, 729 7th Avenue, fue citada en abril por “no mantener la fachada exterior del edificio y los accesorios”.
Los inspectores de construcción observaron que “la terracota dañada en áreas por encima del piso 15 en varios lugares representa un peligro de caída para los peatones”.
Tishman, de 60 años, era vicepresidenta de Zubatkin Owner Representation LLC. Recibió una licenciatura en la Universidad de Princeton en 1981 y una maestría en arquitectura de la Escuela de Graduados de Diseño de la Universidad de Harvard, según su perfil en LinkedIn.
Nacida como Erica Lindenbaum, se casó con el analista financiero Steven Tishman el 20 de junio de 1982, según el anuncio de la boda de la pareja en The New York Times.
También era la nieta de Abraham Lindenbaum, ex presidente de Brooklyn Law School.
Los Tishman han sido miembros de la Sinagoga Central en Manhattan desde 1992, y Erica sirvió como síndica en el templo.

Gruden says NFL apologized for ruling Carr out of bounds

Texto completo: ALAMEDA >> The Raiders didn't get the win, but according to coach Jon Gruden Monday, at least they got an apology.
What could have been a game-clinching play by Derek Carr instead left enough time on the clock for the Jacksonville Jaguars to come back for a 20-16 win in the final game played Sunday at the Coliseum. Gruden said at his weekly press conference the NFL's senior director of officiating admitted officials had erred in determining Carr had gone out of bounds on a first-down run.
"The league called, Al Riveron, he apologized and we accept the apology," Gruden said through clenched teeth. "Derek was in bounds and that play cost us dearly."
Leading 16-13, the Raiders drove to the Jacksonville 43 and faced second-and-9. After the Jaguars used their second time out with 2:12 to play, Carr executed a read-option run that gained 12 yards to the Jacksonville 31-yard line. He took a baseball slide and appeared to give himself up in bounds.
Officials, however, ruled Carr had slid out of bounds, stopping the clock with 2:05 to play. Gruden protested, but to no avail. So instead of the Raiders running the ball to the two-minute warning and/or forcing Jacksonville to burn another time out, they were penalized for delay of game back to the 36 with the clock stopped.
The whole sequence cost the Raiders more than 30 seconds of clock time. The Jaguars scored the winning points with 31 seconds left.
When asked his thoughts about the apology, Gruden conceded his frustration with the way some things have been officiated this year had reached the boiling point.
"I don't like it at all. They stopped the game in Indiana and took my middle linebacker (Vontaze Burfict) away for 12 weeks. Ended his season," Gruden said. "They stopped the game in Kansas City and took (Trayvon) Mullen's interception away.
"Why the hell don't you stop the game and get the clock right? I don't think it was even close. So I'm not happy about it. Apologies are great, but this is 2020. I've been in enough meetings and I'm disgusted by it. I don't want instant replay in my life, personally, but if we're going to have it, let's use it properly. I don't think it's that hard."
Gruden cited another play where Curtis Riley was called for offsides on a Jacksonville touchdown drive in the fourth quarter that was in error.
"Everybody I'm sure has sour grapes today when it comes to officiating," Gruden said. "What happened yesterday, the quarterback gave himself up, in the field of play, we got eight guys out there . . . it's not real fulfilling. Nor is it fulfilling for our team or our fans that came out to support us."
PLAYOFFS? SERIOUSLY? >> There is a path which could lead the Raiders into a wild card berth, and the most difficult part about it based on their recent play and four-game losing streak is winning their last two games to finish 8-8
But if the Raiders were to beat the Chargers and Broncos on the road, here is what would need to happen:
Indianapolis (6-7), Tennessee (8-6) and Pittsburgh (8-6) would all need to finish 8-8. The Colts play New Orleans Sunday (10-3) Monday night and finish with Carolina (5-9) and Jacksonville (5-9). The Titans (8-6) face New Orleans (10-3) and Houston (9-5). The Steelers close with the New York Jets (5-9) and Baltimore Ravens (12-2).
In that scenario, it would come down to Raiders vs. Steelers and strength of schedule. Games are still to be played but the Raiders would have a 96 percent chance of coming out on top according to The Upshot, an analytical site from the New York Times.
"We'll just keep playing hard and that's why we want to play the best players. You never know what can happen, I've seen some strange things happen in this league," Gruden said.
JACOBS, BROWN IN QUESTION FOR LAST TWO GAMES >> Running back Josh Jacobs carried 24 times for 89 yards and now has 242 carries for 1,150 yards. Jacobs said on Snapchat he has a shoulder fracture, the Raiders have never been that specific. The rookie missed the previous week's loss against Tennessee.
Asked how Jacobs came out of the Jacksonville game, Gruden said, "Not real good. He had a hard time getting his shoulder pads off yesterday. All I could say is I've coached a long time and I've had really tough backs. Really tough guys. And he is up there at the top of the food chain. He is one tough customer. He gave us everything he had yesterday, but his status for the coming weeks will be in question."
Gruden said tackle Trent Brown would also be listed as questionable but sounded less than optimistic about his return.
"When these guys can play, we're going to play 'em. We need 'em to win," Gruden said. "But obviously we're going to do right by the player and what he training staff says and right now it doesn't appear Trent is going to play."
WHAT ABOUT DESHONE KIZER? >> DeShone Kizer remains under contract through 2020, with the Raiders acquiring his original contract when they claimed Kizer off waivers.
Gruden made no promises that Kizer would get some snaps in the last two games at the expense of Carr, but didn't say he wouldn't, either.
"I want to win the game. I want to win. We want to win," Gruden said. "And we're going to do everything we can to win," Gruden said. "We'll see what happens here down the road with DeShone Kizer. To answer your question I want to win the game and we're going to play our best players to win."

Texto completo: It’s one thing for social media giants to let their platforms be used as agents of foreign powers to manipulate the American people, sow social discord and disrupt democracy. Our elected leaders and even the courts appear willing to abide that disgrace.
But it is altogether another thing to stand by while social media companies facilitate the work of sex traffickers who groom and exploit children and then see those companies use federal law as a shield against taking any real responsibility for what happens on their websites.
That has long been the secret of Big Tech’s consolidation of power and influence — a bad law. And that is the reason that a small number of tech companies have captured near-monopolistic market share — because of a provision in the 1996 Communications Decency Act that gives them almost blanket immunity from liability for what people post on their sites.
Forget about fake news. To Big Tech, child sex trafficking and other horrible abuses aren’t really their problem — at least not when it comes to taking legal responsibility for the way their sites are used as mediums of exchange for this sort of terrible material.
Maybe, though, that is about to change, and maybe Texas will lead the way.
Down in Houston, there is a personal injury lawyer named Annie McAdams who, so far, has had remarkable success in state court pushing forward lawsuits on behalf of three girls who became trafficking victims after men contacted them through their Instagram accounts, groomed them into leaving their homes and had them quickly trapped inside hotel rooms where they were sold to man after man.
Normally, suits likes McAdams’ are dismissed out of hand, with an army of Facebook lawyers citing Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects web platforms not only from liability but from lawsuits themselves.
That’s exactly what happened in this case. But at least in the early stages, Texas courts aren’t letting Facebook have its way.
McAdams’ claims, first detailed in a recent New York Times story, have so far survived Facebook’s attempts to kill the suits at the trial court and the appeals court level. And, earlier this month, the Texas Supreme Court denied Facebook’s request to overturn what the company called “abuse of discretion” by the 14th Court of Appeals in letting McAdams’ suits go forward.
This represents a substantial change in how state courts have been treating Facebook’s claims. Credit, surely, goes to Congress’ minor awakening last year over social media and sex trafficking. With President Donald Trump’s support, Congress passed what is known as SESTA, the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, which has created a small crack in the immunity shield internet companies have hidden behind.
McAdams is trying to martial her suits through that crack, widening it with each filing. Settling isn’t on McAdams’ mind. She wants these suits to change the way social media does business.
“We absolutely intend to hold Facebook responsible for what the pimps and traffickers are doing,” she said.
Thanks to the Supreme Court’s ruling, Facebook now owes McAdams discovery about the company’s policies and practices, things Facebook doesn’t share beyond what it wants shared.
What she finds is likely to be interesting.
One of McAdams’ suits — on behalf of a 14-year-old girl whose life as a trafficking victim began on Instagram — quotes a now infamous 2016 memo by a Facebook vice president named Andrew Bosworth about Facebook’s “ugly” truth: “Maybe it costs a life exposing someone to bullies. Maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on our tools. And still we connect people.”
Connecting people is a “de facto” good, Bosworth wrote, whatever the cost. In the case of McAdams’ suits, it connected children with the people who exploited them.
Mark Zuckerberg distanced himself from Bosworth’s memo, even as called him a “talented leader who says many provocative things.” And Zuckerberg, along with top deputies, has since made many public promises about how Facebook is going to fix its content problems.
But here’s the real ugly truth — Facebook isn’t fixing its problems and maybe can’t fix its problems if it wants to. Big Tech companies say a lot of things in public about how they are working to make their sites and products safer to protect the public. But look at what they do when it comes to lawsuits like those brought by McAdams. Facebook’s filing before the Texas Supreme Court is replete with the repetition of a single defense — that it is immune from responsibility under the law.
The Big Tech giants want it both ways — to say they are fixing things and then avoid real responsibility for following through. The days of having it both ways need to end. It’s unlikely now that they will end in the halls of Congress. Tech companies have become lavish with their lobbying money, and politicians are ever more addicted to their social media audiences.
But perhaps the courts of Texas will be willing to draw the line and say enough is enough on behalf of our children and our country.

Texto completo: Match gets taken off the air after Özil condemns treatment of Muslim Uighurs
A scheduled live television broadcast Sunday of an English Premier League match was canceled by a Chinese state-run network after comments by Mesut Özil, the star of one of the featured teams, criticized the country for its treatment of Muslims.
The back-and-forth between Özil and representatives of Arsenal and the Chinese government is just the latest tension encountered by behemoth pro sports leagues doing business in China, following weeks of controversy after an NBA executive expressed support for protesters in Hong Kong.
Sunday's match between Manchester City and Arsenal, which has a large following and extensive commercial interests in China, was preempted after social media posts by Özil, a German Muslim who is of Turkish heritage. In the posts, the midfielder condemned China's detention of Uighurs, a largely Muslim Turkic minority, in Xinjiang.
Instead of the Arsenal match, China Central Television carried a prerecorded match between Tottenham and Wolverhampton.
'[In China] Qurans are burned, mosques were closed down, Islamic theological schools, madrasas were banned, religious scholars were killed one by one. Despite all this, Muslims stay quiet,' Özil wrote Friday on social media, using an image of the flag of the former East Turkestan republic that is now under the control of Xinjiang.
On Monday, a spokesman for China's foreign ministry said Özil, who has more than 4 million followers on China's Twitter-style microblogging site Weibo, had been 'blinded by fake news and influenced by untruthful remarks.'
'We welcome Mr. Özil to visit Xinjiang and see for himself,' Geng Shuang said in Beijing. 'As long as he has common sense, can make a clear distinction between right and wrong, and upholds the principles of objectivity and fairness, he will see a different Xinjiang. He might not know that the Chinese government protects the religious freedom of all Chinese citizens, including Uighurs, according to law . . . and our anti-terrorism campaign there has won the sincere support of locals. Xinjiang enjoys political stability, economic development, national unity, social harmony, and . . . people there live and work in peace and contentment.'
Human rights advocates and governments, including that of the United States, have called on China to allow investigations of Uighur internment camps. Uighur activists and their supporters last month pointed to leaked Chinese documents, reported on by the New York Times, as evidence of repression.
'The Chinese government's cruel, bigoted treatment of Muslims and ethnic minorities is a horrifying human rights violation,' Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), a Democratic presidential candidate, wrote on Twitter. 'We must stand up to hatred and extremism at home " and around the world.'
Arsenal had hoped to distance itself from Özil's pro-Uighur posts Saturday, writing in a statement on Weibo: 'What Özil posted on social media was entirely his personal opinion. As a football club, Arsenal has always adhered to the principle of noninvolvement in politics.'
Like the NBA, which found itself in a similar situation when Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey tweeted his support for pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, the Premier League has a financial arrangement with China: a three-year, $700 million deal for broadcast rights that runs through 2022.
Arsenal is one of several teams owned by Stan Kroenke, whose company also owns the Los Angeles Rams, Denver Nuggets, Colorado Avalanche, Colorado Rapids and other teams. Arsenal toured China in 2017 for a preseason promotion and also owns a chain of team-themed restaurants in the country. Although Arsenal does not have as big of a presence as Real Madrid or Manchester United in the world's most populous country, it does fear putting off big-spending sponsors and a Chinese fan base.
CCTV aired a documentary this month that defended Beijing's campaign of 'fighting terrorism in Xinjiang' on its English news channel CGTN. The state-run tabloid Global Times claimed that the decision to cancel the CCTV broadcast was made after Özil's 'false comments on Xinjiang disappointed Chinese fans and football governing authorities.' The streaming service PPTV.com also canceled a feed of Arsenal's 3-0 loss.
Over the weekend, an editorial in the Chinese sports weekly Titan Sports slammed Özil for 'paying too much attention to politics and too little to soccer.' Weibo was abuzz with fury over Özil, with the hashtag #OzilMadeWrongfulComments making it into the top trending topics over the weekend. TV soccer commentator Zhan Jun posted on Weibo on Saturday, saying Özil's 'vicious' statements should result in 'an end to his Premier League career.'
One Weibo user posted video of Özil's Arsenal shirts being burned in protest. Others said his comments were worse than Morey's and the team should not even consider another visit to China until it settles the matter.
'Arsenal has made a mistake of not having got rid of [Özil] earlier,' Titan Sports chief editor Luo Ming, who has more than 600,000 followers on Weibo, posted Monday. 'What happened recently will certainly not help him stay longer.'

Texto completo: Speaking with Fox and Friends, Dennis Prager claimed that President Trump is the "greatest friend Jews have had since Harry Truman." The radio host and founder of Prager University, an online nonprofit organization that creates conservative videos, joined the program to discuss the president's signing of a bill to fight anti-Semitism on college campuses in America.
Last week, Trump issued an executive order that classified the Jewish people as an ethnic group and granted protections against anti-Semitism on college campuses. Universities across the country have seen a recent rise in anti-Semitic demonstrations, highlighted by the boycott, divest, and sanctions protests.
"The Left's taking over of college campuses has increased anti-Semitism to an unprecedented degree in American history," Prager said. "The Left, not liberals, the Left, everywhere they go, they introduce hate."
In May of 2018, Trump marked the 70th anniversary of the founding of Israel by moving the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. Though his predecessors campaigned to enact similar reform, Trump became the first president to follow through with his promise.
Trump has faced anti-Semitic criticism throughout his administration, specifically in the days and weeks that followed the death of Heather Heyer at the Unite the Right march in Charlottesville, Virginia.
Prager also criticized New York Times columnist Paul Krugman, saying he is "perhaps the most hysterical writer in the United States published anywhere."

The old organ console for the New York Philharmonic ended up in Utah. Will another organ roar in the orchestra’s new Geffen Hall?

Texto completo: New York • When long-awaited drawings of the plan to rebuild David Geffen Hall, the New York Philharmonic’s home at Lincoln Center, were released this month, James Kennerley’s eyes were immediately drawn to the blank wall above the stage.
He was looking for pipes.
“I was surprised to see there was no pipe organ case,” said Kennerley, dean of the New York City chapter of the American Guild of Organists.
Organists, and those who love the natural, visceral sound of mighty pipe organs, have long lamented that both of New York’s premier concert halls, Carnegie Hall and Geffen, got rid of their old pipe organs decades ago and went electric. They see the coming renovation of Geffen as a chance to right a historical wrong, especially at a time when many of the world’s most glamorous new halls — including Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, the Philharmonie in Paris and the Elbphilharmonie in Hamburg — have installed mammoth new pipe organs.
But the Philharmonic and Lincoln Center must weigh the desires of organ aficionados against competing needs. For money, of course, but also for an even more precious New York commodity: space. How much square footage can or should be devoted to an organ, which plays a key role in a beloved but limited slice of the core orchestral repertoire? And the hall’s planners face a classic renovators’ conundrum: Do you go with built-in or something more flexible? There are pros and cons to a new pipe organ, as well as to one of the latest digital models, which boast ever more realistic samples and better sound technology.
No decision has been made, said Deborah Borda, president and chief executive officer of the Philharmonic. “The Philharmonic is advocating for an organ solution,” she said, adding that she expects a decision by the time the design development phase wraps up this spring. (Construction in the hall is expected to begin in 2022, aiming for a 2024 opening.)
The organ question has emerged as an early flashpoint in the renovation, with some questioning why a symphony orchestra — which relies on the finest unamplified instruments it can get in nearly every other case — would make an exception when it comes to the venerable organ, which is sometimes called the king of instruments.
“What serious pianist would prefer an electronic keyboard to a refined Steinway or a piano by any other excellent builder?” asked Paul Jacobs, chairman of the Juilliard School’s organ department.
Of course, pipe organs are many orders of magnitude bigger than pianos.
The Philharmonic used to have one. A floor-shaking, 45,000-pound Aeolian-Skinner organ with 5,498 pipes — the largest was 32 feet long — was built for it when it moved to the Lincoln Center in 1962. Composer Paul Hindemith wrote his Concerto for Organ and Orchestra for the new instrument that season.
But the organ was removed during a renovation of the hall in 1976, in part to free up space backstage, and to spare the expense of reducing its size and relocating it within the hall.
The instrument found a new home in a California megachurch, televangelist Robert H. Schuller’s Crystal Cathedral, where it was combined with another organ to form one of the largest in the world. Now it is getting a new life: After the Crystal Cathedral was bought in 2012 by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange and renamed Christ Cathedral, the massive organ was transported to Padua, Italy, to be restored. The refurbished instrument will be rededicated this May by Jacobs and others.
Perhaps more unexpected was the fate of the Philharmonic’s old console, the command center of keyboards, pedals and stops where the organist sits and plays. It apparently made its way to a farm in Hooper, Utah — to a pipe organ housed in a barn that came to be known as the Hoopernacle.
Hal Stoddard, 84, a rancher and amateur organist, built the Hoopernacle — and installed what several organists said appeared to be the Philharmonic’s old console, which he salvaged from a collection of organ parts — when he was not busy raising cattle and growing alfalfa.
“I told my wife once that I sure don’t look very much like an organist,” Stoddard said in a telephone interview. So she made him a sign: “It is better to look like a cowboy and play like an organist than to look like an organist and play like a cowboy.”
The removal of the Philharmonic’s organ came at a moment when pipe organs were falling out of favor in concert halls. Carnegie got rid of its pipe organ — which had taken 12 freight cars to transport from St. Louis, where it was built — in the early 1960s after it had fallen into disrepair, and turned down the gift of a new one amid concerns that its installation would harm the hall’s acoustics. The Cleveland Orchestra installed a new acoustical stage shell in Severance Hall in 1958 that so muffled its old pipe organ that the instrument needed amplification; it eventually fell silent in 1976.
But pipe organs have enjoyed a revival recently. New ones have been installed in concert halls in Dallas, Philadelphia and Nashville, Tennessee. Old ones, including in Cleveland, Chicago, Boston and Alice Tully Hall at Lincoln Center, have been restored. Organ concertos have been written by composers including Nico Muhly and Christopher Rouse.
The pipe organ revival is tenuous, though. One of the world’s biggest organ stars, Cameron Carpenter, concertizes on an impressive digital instrument called the International Touring Organ. This year the University of Oklahoma decided to close its respected organ technology and repair program, dismaying some in the field.
The design team for the new Geffen Hall is weighing its options — which are limited, given that they are working to rebuild the auditorium while staying within its existing footprint.
Gary McCluskie, who is leading the team from Diamond Schmitt Architects designing the hall, said the space that once housed the organ extended through three stories backstage and had been transformed into dressing rooms and other spaces used by musicians and artists — cramped areas that many in the hall would like to see improved.
“It’s a balancing act,” he said.
Calls for a new pipe organ for the Philharmonic date to when Kurt Masur was its music director in the 1990s and Borda was serving her first stint there, as executive director. She said that one oft-repeated tale, that a benefactor had donated nearly $1 million for a new pipe organ, was “urban mythology,” and that the money had gone to the orchestra’s general endowment as a “turn the lights on, pay the musicians gift.”
“We couldn’t accommodate an organ the size of, say, the Walt Disney Concert Hall organ,” Borda added. “That’s simply not in the cards. But there are all sorts of solutions, from a pipe organ to an electronic organ to a digital organ, and right now that’s what’s being determined.”
Kent Tritle, the Philharmonic’s organist, said the orchestra’s current instrument — which relies on 12 speaker arrays hung along the back of the stage and two large bass speakers on either side of it — was far better than its electronic predecessors. But, he said, “My position has always been there’s nothing like an actual pipe setting a column of air in motion.”
He is working with the design team to weigh the options, from digital to smaller pipe organs with high air pressure that might be able to fulfill symphonic requirements in less space.
“I’m both a proponent of pipe organs,” he said, “and I’m also a pragmatist.”

Texto completo: U.S. Rep. Jeff Van Drew, Democrat who was elected in last year's "blue wave" in South Jersey's Second Congressional District, plans to switch parties and become a Republican, according to multiple national news organizations.
The New York Times reported Saturday afternoon that Van Drew, a moderate Democrat who is opposed to the impeachment of President Donald Trump, "told aides on Saturday that he is planning to switch parties and declare himself a Republican as soon as next week, just as the House is casting its historic votes on articles of impeachment."
A former state legislator, Van Drew, 66, of Dennis Township in Cape May, was elected in the November 2018 midterms which resulted in the defeat of every Republican for federal office but U.S. Rep. Chris Smith, who was left as the lone GOP member of New Jersey's congressional delegation earlier this year.
Van Drew's district includes all of Cape May, Atlantic, Cumberland and Salem counties, parts of Burlington, Camden and Gloucester counties and a portion of southern Ocean County.
He succeeded U.S. Rep. Frank LoBiondo, a Republican who had served in the U.S. House of Representatives for 24 years before he retired with the last election.
Politico reported Saturday afternoon that Van Drew was one of two Democrats who voted against opening the impeachment inquiry and that he remained against the effort, even as the House prepares to vote on articles of impeachment next week.
"The stunning move comes amid new polling that shows Van Drew's approval ratings are under water with Democratic voters in his district," Politico reported. "According to a survey conducted between Dec. 7 and Dec. 10, just 24 percent of respondents think he deserves to be reelected, while 60 percent said they want someone new to represent them."
The New York Times and Politico both reported that Van Drew went to see Trump at the White House on Friday.
The congressman "sought Trump's blessing for the move, which could be critical to his ability to avoid a primary challenge next year, and the president urged him to make the jump, according to two Democrats and one Republican who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to disclose the talks," the Times reported.
Gov. Phil Murphy slammed the congressman in a series of tweets on Saturday night, writing that Van Drew "has chosen his political career over our Constitution. Despite knowing full well that the President has abused the powers of his office, he's now willing to enable Donald Trump just to try to salvage his own election."
Ocean County Freeholder Director Virginia E. Haines, who is also a member of the Republican National Committee, said she was not aware of Van Drew's plans to become a Republican, but that she was not surprised.
Haines said that because Van Drew could not support the march of his caucus toward impeachment, as a Democrat, he would have alienated his party's base going into an election year and energized Republican support for a challenger in a congressional district that already leans Republican.

Texto completo: LOUISVILLE, Ky. – A defiant Matt Bevin says he would welcome a federal investigation into the controversial last-minute pardons and commutations he issued before leaving the governor’s office last week, adding he is convinced that some he pardoned of crimes, including brutal murder, rape and child abuse, are innocent.
“This is going to be very cathartic," Bevin told The Louisville Courier Journal, part of the USA TODAY Network.
"There's nothing more antiseptic than the truth. And the truth is something that needs to be shined into some corners of the criminal justice system, in this state and in this country. "
Bevin even suggested that some of the county prosecutors who are the fiercest critics of his pardons may end up as the ones investigated and prosecuted if federal investigators get involved.
"You will see people subpoenaed, you will see people deposed, you will see people convicted," he predicted during the Saturday night interview.
On Twitter: Ex-Gov. Matt Bevin defends flurry of pardons as Kentucky lawmakers call for investigation
"If the truth comes out, there will be people involved in this process on the other side of the equation that have very good reason to be very concerned right now. And some of them are the loudest people right now, and for good reason. "
Squarely in Bevin’s sights are state legislators and prosecutors – including Republican Senate President Robert Stivers – who have called on commonwealth and federal law enforcement to investigate some of his more controversial pardons and commutations.
In his interview with The Courier Journal, the one-term Republican governor insinuated his critics are grandstanding for political gain.
"There's a boatload of legislators who are all outraged right now who sure advocated the crap out of me for the last four years, including some of the loudest ones," Bevin said. "Political opportunism is an interesting thing. "
The Courier Journal was the first to reveal one of Bevin’s most controversial decisions: Pardoning Patrick Baker two years into his 19-year sentence for killing Donald Mills in a Knox County home invasion and robbery.
Pardoning Patrick Baker: Kentucky governor pardons convicted killer whose brother hosted campaign fundraiser for him
In the weekend interview, Bevin initially claimed several times that he didn't know and couldn't remember ever meeting with or speaking to Patrick Baker's brother, Eric, who held a campaign fundraiser for Bevin at his home last year that raised $21,500, state public records show.
The Courier Journal last week reported on Bevin's attendance at the July 26, 2018, fundraiser – including publishing a photo of Bevin and Eric Baker talking at Baker's home. The story included a firsthand account from the publisher of the local newspaper of Bevin having a private meeting with the Baker family.
Asked about the fundraiser again, the former governor then conceded he had spoken to Eric Baker before, "But I don't know if I've spoken to him about this. "
Bevin added that he could not remember ever being at the Bakers’ home.
The former governor also insisted Baker is an innocent man – despite the outcry over Patrick Baker's pardon from Mills' family, the local prosecutor in the case and those questioning if the political donations played a role.
The real killer, Bevin said, hasn't been fully brought to justice.
"I looked at (the Patrick Baker case) for months and months," said Bevin, adding he had "a lot of conversations" with people about the circumstances of Mills' murder and Baker's trial.
"If you truly care about the truth of that story, among others, stay with it, stay on it, ask a lot of questions," Bevin said. "You'll find a lot of people both inside and outside of Kentucky are very aware of that case. "
Matt Bevin on Micah Schoettle pardon: 'Not everything that you are told is true'
Bevin also defended his pardon of Micah Schoettle, who was convicted of raping a 9-year-old in Kenton County last year and sentenced to 23 years.
Bevin claimed Schoettle is innocent because there is no physical, medical or eyewitness evidence against him, adding that "not everything that you are told is true, including in a courtroom. "
"Go sit down, talk to (Schoettle), talk to the other people involved, talk to the mother of the daughter, who was involved in the accusation," Bevin said. "You dig into that thing and find out what did or didn't happen. "
The mother of the victim in the Schoettle case recounted to The New York Times her outrage when learning about the pardon, saying her family had only recently begun to recover from the trial and "it scares me to think that he knows he got away with it. "
Bevin's pardon order for Schoettle stated the case “was investigated and prosecuted in a manner that was sloppy at best. "
Kentucky Senate President Robert Stivers condemns pardon decisions
Shortly after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Friday called Bevin's pardons "completely inappropriate," Stivers, the Republican president of the state Senate, called for a federal investigation of Bevin's pardons.
“From what we know of former Gov. Bevin’s extreme pardons and commutations, the Senate Republican Majority condemns his actions as a travesty and perversion of justice," Stivers said in a press release. "Our citizens, and especially the crime victims and their families, deserve better. "
Asked about the comments from McConnell and Stivers, Bevin said his two Republican critics did not provide any specifics about what wrongdoing he was guilty of, adding that such "broad categorizations make for good press releases, make for good tabloid fodder. "
"People like that, they'll never give you specifics," Bevin said. "He'll express outrage, but over what? Specifically, what is the outrage based on?"
Asked about Bevin's comments, Stivers on Sunday stood by his concerns and call for a federal investigation, particularly into the circumstances surrounding the pardon of Patrick Baker.
"It has an appearance that calls for individuals to look into the case," said Stivers, citing the overwhelming evidence in the case, "the photos you've seen" of Bevin and Patrick Baker's brother at the campaign fundraiser and "the inconsistencies in the pardons of one but not all three," as two accomplices in the crime are still in jail.
Matt Bevin expresses 'absolute confidence' in people he pardoned
In the Courier Journal interview, Bevin said he alone went through all of the pardon and commutation applications and made the determinations of who was worthy of one, writing all of the orders himself.
He added he would also ask for feedback on certain cases from public advocates and officials in the Kentucky Justice and Public Safety Cabinet.
The former governor said he would listen to cases for pardons made by anyone, including legislators, people on this team and "people who might come up to me at a Lincoln Day dinner and say, 'Hey, you know, what about this, that or the other person. '"
"I'll listen to anybody," Bevin said. "Believe me, I talked to people out the wazoo. I'll take anyone's opinion on something. "
Bevin also said he had "absolute confidence" that everyone he pardoned would not have a serious future run-in with the law.
"I can't predict the future, but . . . I'm as confident about these folks as I am about you or me or somebody that passes me on the street next," he said.

Wooster author offers ‘Hanger Management’ advice

Texto completo: WOOSTER — We’ve all been there, cranky and tired because we haven’t eaten.
Snickers had a whole ad campaign centered around it, something we now call “hangry.”
It’s not a gimmick created to sell candy bars, according to Cleveland Clinic psychologist Susan Albers. Being “hangry” is a very real thing, she said, and she’s dedicated an entire book to it.
“Hanger Management,” due out on Christmas Eve, is the ninth book for the Wooster-based Albers, who specializes in eating issues and body issue concerns. The timing of the book’s release isn’t a coincidence, she said, because it was designed to get the information into the hands of readers during the biggest eating season of the year, one which is followed by the inevitable New Year’s resolutions.
In past books, which have dealt with mindful eating, Albers said her inspiration came from her clients. But with the new release, she looked to her two children, ages 9 and 13. Her book opens with a story of Albers sitting with her then-toddler daughter in church and realizing she left the bag of Cheerios at home. As the child got hungry, she started to squirm and eventually got up and ran to the front of the sanctuary.
She was hangry.
Even now, Albers said she is careful about the school pick-up. “You can feel the tension in the air” when the kids get in the car. They’ve worked hard all day and lunch was hours ago. “They’re hangry.”
So, they go home and have a healthy snack first.
“How you feel impacts what you eat and what you eat impacts how you feel,” she explained, adding the not eating results in a lowering of the blood sugar. And too often, people who are really hungry end up overeating or eating whatever is readily available.
“Hanger Management” offers scientifically researched tips on how to avoid hanger and the subsequent overeating – everything from adding a little cinnamon to coffee or cereal regulate blood sugar, to eating pumpkin seeds to ward off blood sugar spikes to drinking tart cherry juice to improve sleep and thus better regulate appetite hormones.
Never, Albers pointed out, has she advocated for a particular diet. Lately, she said, intermittent fasting is “the latest fad diet coming into my office.” And while that generally means some weight loss due to eating less and less frequently, going without food for a period of time leads to hanger.
Dieting is not sustainable. Mindfulness is, she said. “I’m such an advocate for eating the foods you love,” she said, “but with mindfulness.” Diets are external; mindfulness comes from an internal place.
With nine books to her credit, Albers said she also is learning how to juggle family, career and writing – the latter of which started more as a hobby. Her persistence has led her to appear on the New York Times’ Bestseller list and to being a contributor to both the Huffington Post and Psychology Today.
“I sort of love it,” she said of her second career. “This is the first year I don’t just say ‘psychologist’; I say ‘author.’”

Texto completo: Felix Rohatyn, una importante figura de Wall Street a quien se adjudica haber salvado a Nueva York de la bancarrota murió el sábado a los 91 años de edad en su casa de Manhattan, anunció su hijo citado por The New York Times.
Este refugiado judío nacido en Austria y naturalizado estadounidense se hizo conocido en el campo de las finanzas acumulando éxitos en el sector de fusiones y adquisiciones y escalando lugares del prestigioso banco de inversión Lazard Frères (ahora Lazard).
Hábil negociador, se convirtió en un asesor escuchado por las élites políticas estadounidenses e innumerables hombres de negocios, construyendo una reputación como un hombre capaz de encontrar una solución aceptable para los problemas más difíciles. Lo llamaban “Felix, el reparador”.
Esta cualidad le valió la misión de salvar a Nueva York de la bancarrota en la década de 1970 , cuando la ciudad se estaba desmoronando. Una tarea que llevaría a cabo mucho más tiempo de lo inicialmente planeado, supervisando las finanzas de la ciudad durante 18 años.
“La vida extraordinaria de Felix Rohatyn es una historia emblemática de Nueva York”, dijo el alcalde de la ciudad, Bill de Blasio.

Texto completo: World
The Xinjiang regional government in China's far west is deleting data, destroying documents, tightening controls on information and has held high-level meetings in response to leaks of classified papers on its mass detention camps for Uighurs and other predominantly Muslim minorities, according to four people in contact with government employees there.
Top officials deliberated how to respond to the leaks in meetings at the Chinese Communist Party's regional headquarters in Urumqi, Xinjiang's capital, some of the people said. They spoke on condition of anonymity because of fears of retribution against themselves, family members and the government workers.
The meetings began days after the New York Times published last month a cache of internal speeches on Xinjiang by top leaders, including Chinese President Xi Jinping. They continued after the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists worked with news organizations around the world including the Associated Press to publish secret guidelines for operating detention centers and instructions on how to use technology to target people.
The Chinese government has long struggled with its 11-million-strong Uighur population, an ethnic Turkic minority native to Xinjiang, and in recent years has detained 1 million or more Uighurs and other minorities in the camps.
North Korea conducts another test at long-range rocket site
SEOUL, South Korea - North Korea said Saturday it successfully performed another "crucial test" at its long-range rocket launch site that will further strengthen its nuclear deterrent.
The test - the second at the facility in a week, according to North Korea's Academy of Defense Science - possibly involved technologies to improve intercontinental ballistic missiles that could reach the continental United States.
In a separate statement, Pak Jong Chon, chief of the Korean People's Army's general staff, asserted North Korea has built up "tremendous power" and the findings from the recent tests would be used to develop new weapons to allow the country to "definitely and reliably" counter U.S. nuclear threats.
The North in recent weeks has been dialing up pressure to coax major concessions from the Trump administration as it approaches an end-of-year deadline set by leader Kim Jong Un to salvage faltering nuclear negotiations.
Fighting rages near Libya's capital amid push by rebels
CAIRO - Two days after rebel Libyan commander Khalifa Hifter declared a "final" and decisive battle for the capital Tripoli, heavy fighting raged for a 24-hour period between his troops and militias loosely allied with the internationally backed government based in the city, officials said Saturday.
The fighting came after Hifter, the leader of the self-styled Libyan National Army, said Thursday the "zero hour" of his battle for Tripoli had begun, nearly eight months after he began an offensive to take the city from the country's Government of National Accord supported by the U.N.
The LNA's media office shared images of reinforcements arriving in Tripoli, including ground troops and pickup trucks with mounted machine guns and of clashes in southern parts of the city. Hifter's forces took control of the town of al-Tawghaar, just south of Tripoli, the LNA said. But Tripoli-based forces disputed that claim.
The fighting has threatened to plunge Libya into another bout of violence rivaling the scale of the 2011 conflict that ousted and killed longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi.

Texto completo: Fort Huachuca in Arizona is one of many military bases across the United States restricting the training of Saudi Arabian students after last week's shooting at a Navy base in Florida.
The Florida shooter was a Saudi Arabian lieutenant studying at Naval Air Station Pensacola. Three U.S. sailors died and several were injured in the shooting.
Six Saudi officers are currently training at Fort Huachuca, the Army base just north of the U.S.-Mexico border near Sierra Vista.
No Saudi officers are currently training at Luke Air Force Base near Glendale or Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson, according to base representatives.
The Saudi officers at Fort Huachuca and across the country are temporarily restricted to classroom training as the Pentagon reviews screening procedures for foreign students, according to a Dec. 10 memo from Deputy Secretary of Defense David Norquist.
Saudi students at Fort Huachuca are enrolled in a Military Intelligence Captains Career Course and a Military Intelligence Basic Officer Leadership Course, Tanja Linton, a base spokeswoman, said.
The officers learn leadership and intelligence doctrine and concepts in those courses, Linton said.
In keeping with the defense department's directive, Saudi officers at the base are not training at the base's ranges, Linton said.
"We are adhering to the DoD order and continue to train the critical tasks associated with intelligence doctrine and concepts central to the training and education of lieutenants and captains," Linton said.
Why are Saudi officers training here? The U.S. Department of Defense considers international military education and training critical to "building allies and partners' capacity," according to the Pentagon memo.
There are currently 5,181 foreign students from 153 countries training at U.S. military bases, according to Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Uriah L. Orland.
Of those, 852 are from Saudi Arabia, as of Dec. 6, Orland said. More than 28,000 Saudi students have trained in the country over time, according to the memo.
The training for Saudi students is meant to introduce them to U.S. values, ideas and policies. That includes human rights, the principle of civilian control of the military and U.S. law.
More generally, international military students that train in the U.S. also become familiar with U.S. weapons. At Luke Air Force Base, for example, students from Australia, Norway, The Netherlands and Italy are currently training on F-35s, and students from Singapore and Taiwan are training on F-16s, according to a base representative.
The shooting may further complicate U.S.-Saudi relations. As the war in Yemen continues, the White House has been fighting efforts in Congress to cut military aid to the Saudis, according to the New York Times.
The Pentagon memo calls Saudi Arabia an "essential partner," and says the Pentagon will continue partnering with the country to "reinforce defense cooperation, increase military investment, and advance America's interests."
Norquist this week directed the Pentagon to "take immediate steps to strengthen personal vetting for International Military Students, and to complete a review within 10 days of policies and procedures for screening foreign students and granting access to our bases."
The restricted training will be in place until that review is completed, the memo said.
What is taught at Fort Huachuca? Fort Huachuca is an Army installation about 15 miles north of the Mexican border.
It is home to the U.S. Army Intelligence Center of Excellence and the U.S. Army Network Enterprise Technology Command.
Along with Saudi Arabia, Linton said, the base trains officers from the following countries: Argentina, Colombia, Czech Republic, Djibouti, Egypt, Estonia, Ethiopia, Guatemala, Hungary, Indonesia, Jordan, Kenya, Korea (Seoul), Kosovo, Kuwait, Lebanon, Liberia, Mauritius, Nigeria, Oman, Somalia and Tunisia.
The vetting of international officers is done by the U.S. Embassy, Linton said.
Saudi officers have been training at Fort Huachuca for more than 25 years.
The current students are in different classes with different graduation dates, Linton said. International students typically depart the base the day after graduation.
The longest the officers stay at the base is 27 weeks, for the Military Intelligence Captains Career Course.

Notre Dame saved, Wright honored

Texto completo: It was a year of stark contrasts in architecture: The burning and near-destruction of Notre Dame Cathedral versus the revival of once-decrepit buildings like Chicago's Old Post Office. A group of Frank Lloyd Wright buildings finally achieved global recognition yet the world lost several noted design figures, among them I.M. Pei and Chicago's Stanley Tigerman.
Building boomed. Quality was hard to find.
Here are the projects and events that stood out in 2019. Plus some notable losses.
Wright buildings take their rightful place: In a step that was long overdue but still welcome, eight buildings by Frank Lloyd Wright were named to the United Nations' list of the world's most significant cultural and natural sites.
Located in six states and completed between 1909 and 1959, the buildings placed on the UNESCO World Heritage List include the bold concrete structure of Unity Temple in Oak Park and the Prairie style masterpiece of the Robie House in Chicago.
The Frank Lloyd Wright Building Conservancy, a Chicago-based nonprofit that seeks to preserve and protect Wright structures, spearheaded the nomination in cooperation with the U.S. Interior Department.
Separately, the Robie House reopened to the public for tours after a meticulous $11 million-plus restoration by Chicago's Harboe Architects. Credit for that transformation also goes to the Frank Lloyd Wright Trust, a Chicago-based nonprofit that conducts tours of the Robie House and other Wright sites.
Heroic firefighters save Notre Dame: One of the worst days of the year was April 15, when fire ravaged the majestic Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, toppling its delicate Gothic Revival spire and destroying its wood-supported roof. But there was a bright spot: The courage of French firefighters, who saved the great medieval monument.
"Some, at the peril of their own lives, went inside the (Cathedral's) northern tower to protect it from flames at a moment when it could have collapsed at any time," The New York Times reported. "The decisive moment saved the structure."
French President Emmanuel Macron gave the firefighters the medal of honor for their courage, a fitting reminder that buildings have many protectors.
New life for Chicago's Old Post Office: After sitting empty for more than 20 years -- an eyesore that straddled the Eisenhower Expressway -- the Chicago's Old Post Office welcomed its first tenants after an $800 million-plus redevelopment.
Headed by Chicago office of the global firm Gensler, a team of designers turned the hulking structure, built in 1921 and the early 1930s, into hip office space without sacrificing its historic character. They restored the building's once-crumbling art moderne facade and its elegant main lobby. They even retained corkscrewing mail chutes.
It remains to be seen how well the giant building works as an office space, but kudos are nonetheless in order for the designers and the developer, New York-based 601W Cos.
At the U. of C., an architectural oddball is revived: In another successful transformation, the Chicago firm of Farr Associates remade an exotic 1962 building by Edward Durell Stone at the University of Chicago. Now the vibrant headquarters of the U. of C.'s Harris School of Public Policy, it's been renamed the Keller Center.
The $80 million project buffed up the once-decaying exterior of the temple-like structure and rendered it more welcoming. Inside, the architects tore out floor slabs and inserted skylights to make once-constricted spaces into expansive spots to study and exchange ideas. Farr Associates worked on the project with Chicago's Woodhouse Tinucci Architects.
A happy marriage of public housing and a public library: In Chicago, public housing has rarely been associated with good design. But there was a notable exception in 2019: three new structures that combined affordable housing and Chicago Public Library branches.
The best of them, in the Irving Park neighborhood, was designed by Chicago architect John Ronan and developed by Evergreen Real Estate Group. Brightly colored and crisply geometric, it proved the value of the concept called "co-location," which joins a library with another type of building to lower construction costs and boost library attendance. (The other co-location projects were designed by Chicago's Skidmore, Owings & Merrill and Perkins+Will.)
A moving memorial to victims of gun violence: One of the highlights of the third Chicago Architecture Biennial was a memorial to victims of gun violence around the U.S. Designed by the Boston office of the MASS Design Group, the memorial consisted of four houselike structures that displayed in the biennial's Beaux-Arts headquarters, the Chicago Cultural Center.
The design was a crystalline beauty, its glass walls covering wood honeycombs in which mementos of gunshot victims were displayed. The project poignantly made the point that the victims should be remembered as people, not anonymous statistics. The architects hope that the design, a prototype, will evolve into a permanent display. It remains on display as the biennial continues through Jan. 5.
A new look for old lobbies: Among the many remakes of ground-floor lobbies in downtown Chicago, some of which are hideous, one stands out: The redo of the south-facing lobby at the twin-towered CME Center office building, 30 and 10 S. Wacker Drive.
Shaped by Chicago's Krueck + Sexton Architects for the building's New York-based owners, Tishman Speyer, the project transformed a mausoleum-like 1980s lobby into a socially vibrant gateway. Distinguishing features include undulating perimeter glass walls and petal-inspired ceiling. An expansion of the project is due to be complete next year.
Small is beautiful: Another modestly scaled project, a public beach house in Wilmette, showed why Chicago's Woodhouse Tinucci Architects has been able to make a specialty of little lakefront buildings.
The serpentine beach house offered a case study in how a small building can achieve a distinctive presence yet disturb as little precious land as possible. The resolutely modern design was highlighted by a peaked trellis of Siberian larch that sweeps over five small concrete structures. The beach house and new landscaping dramatically enhanced the suburb's Lake Michigan shoreline.
The cathedral of caffeine: The world's largest Starbucks, which opened in the old Crate & Barrel store on North Michigan Avenue, didn't just appeal to Chicago's appetite for being the biggest and the tallest. It delivered a shot of retail theater that made it one of the finest flagship stores on the Mag Mile.
Designed by an in-house team led by Starbucks Chief Design Officer Liz Muller and Vice President Jill Enomoto, the Starbucks Reserve Roastery Chicago, as this emporium is known, respected the modernist Crate & Barrel store by Solomon Cordwell Buenz yet gave it a fresh identity. Here, the playful industrial spirit of "Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory" met the sophisticated Scandinavian modernism championed by Crate & Barrrel's founders, Gordon and Carole Segal.
A bold addition to the skyline: Chicago's high-rise building boom has yielded more architectural quantity than quality. A notable exception is the new NEMA Chicago tower, which, at 896 feet, isn't just Chicago's tallest rental skyscraper but also gives the Near South Side a new landmark. New York architect Rafael Viñoly's design creatively reinterprets the muscular setback style of Willis Tower while clean-lined interiors by New York's David Rockwell draw inspiration from Chicago's street grid and the building itself.
Finally, too many goodbyes: The design community lost an unusual number of major figures in 2019. In Chicago, notable deaths included Stanley Tigerman, a leader of the "Chicago Seven" architects who challenged modernist orthodoxy and opened the way for a more inclusive view of Chicago architecture. We also bid farewell to Lois Wille, the trailblazing reporter, editorial writer and author who wrote the influential book, "Forever Open, Clear, and Free: The Struggle for Chicago's Lakefront." And we lost Franz Schulze, the prolific art critic and biographer who authored biographies of architects Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Philip Johnson.
Other notable architects who died were New York's I.M. Pei, the globe-trotting modernist who brought new life to the Louvre with a giant glass pyramid; Cesar Pelli of New Haven, Conn., who designed the Malaysian twin towers that took the world's tallest building crown from Sears (now Willis) Tower; and Kevin Roche of Hamden, Connecticut, whose credits include New York's Ford Foundation headquarters and Chicago's Leo Burnett Building. Pei and Roche were winners of the Pritzker Architecture Prize, the field's highest honor.

Texto completo: "The Rise of Skywalker" is the end of an era. Kinda. Sorta. Opening Dec. 20, this ninth film in the "Star Wars" saga that began in 1977 has been touted as a grand finale. Yet like the much-ballyhooed "death of Superman" comic-book storyline that made international press in the 1990s - spoiler: He's not dead - the Star Wars franchise isn't going anywhere.
" 'The end of the Skywalker saga' was the way we approached this movie," says the film's director and co-writer J.J. Abrams, 53, in a suite at a Midtown Manhattan hotel. "It wasn't some secret winking - 'We're doing this, but we're setting that up.' I'm not saying there isn't the possibility of other stories with some of the characters in some way," allows the TV auteur behind "Alias" and "Lost" and the director of two "Star Trek" movies. The Star Wars universe, he notes, continues in various media and in such TV series as "The Mandalorian" on Disney+, "and undoubtedly will in other movies. But this is very much an end to this trilogy of trilogies."
It certainly seems so for Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), who died and became "one with the Force" in "The Last Jedi" (2017), and for Han Solo (Harrison Ford), dispatched in "The Force Awakens" (2015). And while General Leia Organa (the late Carrie Fisher) appears in "Rise of Skywalker" through unused and repurposed footage from "The Last Jedi," chances are we won't be seeing more of her going forward. But the title does promise a Skywalker rising, after all. Could it be the single-name-only Rey (Daisy Ridley)? And what about those working stiffs in Canto Bright at the end of the last film, discussing the Skywalker legend - after which one of them accesses the Force? Maybe "Skywalker" is a state of mind.
WHAT WE KNOW
All we do know is that more than a year has passed since the events of "The Last Jedi" and that the Resistance spearheaded by Leia, Rey, Finn (John Boyega) and Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) has been all but quashed by the First Order - now headed by Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) after he killed Supreme Leader Snoke. And from what intimations can be gleaned, we appear to be heading toward a final showdown between those overarching entities the Jedi Order and the Sith.
"Some of it is sort of practical this-would-be-a-fun-action-sequence kind of stuff," Abrams says of how he and co-writer Chris Terrio crafted the culmination. "But the deeper thing is telling a story about friendship, about self-discovery, about faith, about oppression, about what it is to rebel and at what cost." 
"I think the movie is about life and death, really," reflects "Argo" Oscar winner Terrio, 42. "It's about what we leave behind and legacy and how we're remembered," he says of the characters. "And there's a meta component to that, too, because we as writers and filmmakers are grappling with these things when it comes to 'Star Wars.' We are trying to leave a legacy of what these films are and what they mean to us. I think even in the title, without giving away anything about the meaning, but built into it is that sense of birth, death, resurrection and how we remember and what we remember and who we remember."
IN THE BEGINNING
The movie's official credits, as it happens, remember the originally hired director, Colin Trevorrow ("Jurassic World"), who with his writing partner Derek Connolly retains a "story by" credit. Trevorrow, who has been circumspect about the circumstances regarding his exit, told Empire magazine last month it was "not my place" to speak about what he and Connolly might have contributed, other than to say, "I'm grateful to J.J. for embracing some of our ideas."
"I probably shouldn't comment on that stuff," says Terrio. "I can only tell you what I know and what I did." He and Abrams, he says, "started from a blank page. We came on and we started with white boards - dry-erase boards - just writing ideas of what we wanted to see in the last 'Star Wars,' just as fans. ... That later became a document that we would expand and pass back and forth to each other."
During the time they were writing, actress Kelly Marie Tran - the first woman of color in a major Star Wars role, introduced as Resistance mechanic Rose Tico in "The Last Jedi" - became the victim of such virulent racist cyberbullying that she left social media in 2017 and penned a New York Times op-end about it in August 2018. Given the honor and integrity inherent in "Star Wars," and the diversity and inclusiveness of the current trilogy, does it feel as if some of the audience actually worships the Dark Side?
"I don't really think that," says Abrams, before reconsidering. "Some people, sure," he amends. "The internet gives people an often anonymous platform to spew." But it's more than that, he says. "I think hate speech, rage and vitriol has been normalized clearly beyond just online." And while the movie doesn't address that directly, "We live in a complicated time," Abrams says, "and I don't think anyone who is making anything they really care about does it in a vacuum."
"I don't want to speak for the audience," Tran, 30, at the Disney offices in New York, says diplomatically. "I mean, I'm sure there are people like that." And enduring such trolls, she says, "really made me respect artists more across all fields, because I now realize how hard it is to be vulnerable and honest and continue to put work out into the world under that sort of lens."
"Star Wars fans are a passionate group, and I'm only grateful to them," avers Abrams, "even those who are [ticked] off because we changed too little or we changed too much, we didn't use the character the way they saw it fit, whatever the thing is, because they care."
Perhaps one simply has to keep, to use the original film's subtitle, a new hope.
C-3PO HAS BEEN GOLDEN METAL HEART OF 'STAR WARS' This is the droid you're looking for: C-3P0, the golden-metal heart of "Star Wars," played from the beginning by Anthony Daniels - the only actor to have appeared in all 11 movies, even the two spinoffs. "On the set on my last day," the British actor, 73, recalls of "Rise of Skywalker," "I was quite emotional for a few moments." Director and co-writter J.J.  Abrams "made a nice speech and then I made a little speech and so on. I can genuinely say that I had such a happy experience on this film that it's a very good way to go out, and the film itself really is a very good end." Kelly Marie Tran, who plays Rose Tico, met Daniels on her very first day on a Star Wars set, on "The Last Jedi" (2017). "It was a scene with me, John [Boyega], Oscar [Isaac]   and Anthony," she recalls, saying he later told her "he doesn't keep any Star Wars stuff in his actual living space ... He's done such an amazing job of being able to work within this franchise and then in his home life to just, like, forget about it." Not that Daniels isn't wholly in C-3P0's head when in costume. He even shifts to first-person momentarily when talking about the droid. "It is my ability to be tenacious and to have survived this whole whatever-you-would-call it," he says of the character's core qualities. "C-3P0 is quite a lonely figure in many ways." But also Star Wars' own Zelig: Daniels as C-3PO appears in all nine main films and in "Rogue One" (2016), while the actor additionally plays Tak, a con-man slave in the Kessel spice mines, in "Solo" (2018), and Lt. Dannl Faytonni in "Attack of the Clones" (2002) and "Revenge of the Sith" (2005). Of the original, low-budget "Star Wars" (1977), Daniels marvels, "It was a B-movie, a sci-fi one-off. I had 12 weeks on it and I was quite happy when it ended -- it was a ton of work under difficult circumstances. We all thought it was a B or less-value movie. And only George [Lucas]  had the, well, the genius to go through with it," he says of Star Wars' creator. "And here we are thinking of him today as we have moved on and up and around and now quite rightly it's coming to an end.  "But for me," he adds warmly, and with British understatement, "having been there on day one, and being now in Hollywood about to go see the final act, it's a really curious st

Texto completo: A college student in a viral picture from Art Basel has maxed out the annual limit on her health insurance because of chemotherapy treatment for blood cancer.
KEY WEST, Fla. -- It was a photo of a photo, and it was too good to resist: an image of a buzz-haired woman using her cellphone to capture a bruised banana stuck to the wall with a piece of duct tape at Art Basel in Miami Beach.
The news of the Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan's banana -- which sold for six figures -- had come to represent the absurdity of the art world. The photo of the woman, taken by the freelance photographer Rhona Wise, was published in The New York Times and The Washington Post. It appeared on websites in places like Cuba, Russia, China, Italy, Greece and the Middle East.
The caption identified the woman in it as "a visitor."
But now another story is emerging about that photograph shared around the world, one steeped in irony about the hotly debated (and quickly eaten) fruit that fetched such a hefty sum. The 20-year-old college student in the picture, Aruzhan Toleubay, is bald from chemotherapy. And she had recently suspended treatments because she maxed out the annual limit on her health insurance.
Her latest bill: $ 201,987.85.
The photo "brings to light a much larger discussion," her Florida International University adviser, Lorna Baez, wrote while publicizing a GoFundMe effort, "not about defining what is art, but what is life, and the costs to preserve it."
Ms. Toleubay is fine with us telling her story, but she wants to make clear: She is not throwing shade -- not at the University of Miami hospital she owes, not at the insurance company, and especially not at the banana or the artist.
"It is funny how people see modern art different. It inspires me so much," she said of Mr. Cattelan's work. "He is a comedian artist. That was his unique way of showing himself."
Ms. Toleubay looks on the bright side. If three people are willing to pay $ 120,000 or more for a banana, she said, then surely there are people who will help with her hospital expenses.
Ms. Toleubay moved from Kazakhstan to the United States in 2016 to study hospitality management at Florida International University, a public school with campuses in the Miami area. In April, she felt flulike symptoms and had a pain in her rear that felt like hemorrhoids.
It was acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
"What are you talking about?" she remembers telling the physician.
Ms. Toleubay wanted to go home, but doctors told her she was too sick to travel.
Her mother, who lost her job last year after a serious car crash, sold several of the family's assets, including a car and an apartment, to come to Florida to be with her daughter.
The blood cancer was aggressive, and her condition was dire, Ms. Toleubay said. She was hospitalized for 40 days this spring but managed to recover enough to take two courses in the fall semester. Then the bills started coming. She found out that her student insurance policy has a half-million-dollar annual cap.
Florida International University gave her a scholarship to cover her tuition, but Ms. Toleubay said the hospital informed her that each round of chemotherapy would cost $ 34,000, and that the insurance company had ceased paying. She already owes $ 205,000. She suspended her treatment about three weeks ago, with plans to resume in January, when her insurance kicks back in again.
After The Times asked the University of Miami hospital about her case on Friday, Ms. Toleubay said her doctor called to say that the hospital administration decided she must resume treatment. It is unclear, she said, who will pay for that.
"Providing appropriate care to our patients at all times is our top priority," the hospital said in a statement. "In some cases, we work with our patients in navigating their insurance coverage, always putting their care first."
Ms. Toleubay, the statement said, has been in remission since June.
Her friends at school started the GoFundMe in May, and it has raised more than $ 25,000. One of Ms. Toleubay's teachers, the restaurant and nightclub owner David Grutman, made a sizable donation.
Then the photo was taken while she was volunteering at Art Basel, an annual art fair in Miami Beach. Her supporters used the viral story of the banana and the high price it fetched to help publicize their effort, using the hashtag #TheRealBananaStory.
"I thought that if people knew the true story of this picture, we could actually put our energy and efforts in helping her cover the expenses of a treatment that is currently saving her life," Ms. Baez, the director of academics for international students, said.
Ms. Toleubay exudes a positive attitude, and talks excitedly about her plans to study event planning.
"The picture went so viral, but it did not bother me," she said. "My friends started to say how ironic this is. Yes. Of course, it is: the value of life and the value of art."

Join HK kids in protesting Chinese tyranny

Texto completo: As the largest protests in weeks rocked Hong Kong last Sunday, with hundreds of thousands filling downtown streets, I was struck by the simple statement from Alice Wong, 24, a biology researcher, a protester among the many in the city’s Victoria Park: “We don’t want to become like China.”
That’s it. Well, she also told a New York Times reporter the obvious intertwined truth in what the mostly young constant demonstrators are after: “We want Hong Kong to continue being Hong Kong.”
That is, she wants her city-state, the former British colony, to continue being culturally Chinese in the broader sense of the diaspora, in the way that Singapore is Chinese — but not; that vast parts of Kuala Lumpur are Chinese — but not; that, well, Arcadia is Chinese — but not.
A heritage, common tongues, an entrepreneurial bent — but without the snooping authoritarian leadership with which the Communist Party has merely replaced the ancient Chinese landlord class in a political system that is anything but communal.
If the plutocrats in Beijing were smart about it, were able to let go of their manic goal of roping all the billions of Chinese peoples in the world into one system, they would realize letting Hong Kong be Hong Kong — letting Taiwan be Taiwan, for that matter — would be by far the best thing for the Mainland as well. That way they don’t have to move toward systems like those in HK and Taipei and Singapore that are mildly democratic, with a few more civil liberties. They can let the broader Chinese nation let off a little steam of freedom without becoming more open themselves.
Instead, the People’s Republic has to control all things in the territories of its growing empire, even if that means putting a million Uighur Muslims in concentration camps.
I wish I could say that it was remotely possible to foresee a successful end game in the Hong Kong kids’ mass marches. But I can’t. As there’s something in a scorpion’s nature that leads it to sting, there’s something in Beijing’s emperors that won’t broach dissent. Sooner or later they’ll send in the People’s Army to put down the actual people.
But it’s not just Chinese people Beijing wants to control. It’s the rest of us, too.
Pasadena lawyer Rob O’Brien, President Trump’s new national security advisor, came back to town last week to speak at a defense forum.
Outside it, he gave an interview to NPR from which I was very happy to find he’s leading the administration’s anti-China world domination wing by detailing the dangers of other nations allowing the Chinese telecommunications company Huawei to build the internet’s new 5G networks:
“So every medical record, every social media post, every email, every financial transaction, and every citizen of the country with cloud computing and artificial intelligence can be sucked up out of Huawei into massive servers in China,” O’Brien told NPR.
Inside the meeting, he kept up the theme, telling defense industry and military officials: “This isn’t a theoretical threat.”
It’s not. And, as if in some over-the-top parody of international bad guys, China’s leaders are coming after your kids, too. TikTok, that latest fad you don’t understand, is the most-downloaded app this year, featuring 15-second videos mostly shared by young people. Here’s how Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Missouri, puts it: “A company compromised by the Chinese Communist Party knows where your children are, knows what they look like, what their voices sound like, what they’re watching and what they share with each other.” If that sounds like a real-life “The Man in the High Castle” world, then I suggest we join the HK kids, and protest.

Texto completo: In response to "Urban coyote sighting," Letters to the Editor, Dec. 9: Over the years, driving around town in the late night and early hours, I have seen many coyotes in town and in all parts of town. The fact they wait for traffic lights and breaks in traffic shows how intelligent they are.If you need to keep them away from your dwelling, keep food sources away, and install motion activated lights - as they will shun contact with humans. Above all, do not leave pets - especially cats and small dogs - out at night. They are potential dinner, so take care of them.
Don't try to kill coyotes as they are familial in grouping and if one is killed, the unit is broken and more will move in, increasing the numbers in a territory. Obviously stay away from them and don't feed them. And, not incidentally, bobcats live in town also; you just don't see them.

Not represented
A recent article posted on The New Mexican's online edition ("Retired New Mexico government workers decry pension-solvency proposal," Dec. 5), addressed pension reform issues facing the Public Employees Retirement Association of New Mexico.
The article describes the Retired Public Employees of New Mexico as an advocacy group that "represents more than 40,000 people." In fact, RPENM is a small volunteer group of 4,273 members out of a total of 41,189 state retirees identified by PERA for the year ending June 30, 2018.
As a former deputy executive director of PERA, I am one of those 40,000 retirees and RPENM does not represent me, my retired friends or thousands of other retirees who support needed changes to shore up the solvency of the retirement plan.

Firing offense
I agree with New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof about holding the president to as high a standard as the head of a Social Security office, a principal or a journalist ("If Trump were anyone else," Commentary, Nov. 13).
As a retired federal employee relations specialist, I wrote termination letters for employees who violated federal regulations. One case involved an Internal Revenue Service employee who bribed a taxpayer, in writing, to pay her for abating his penalties. The taxpayer did not comply; he reported her to IRS authorities. Although the requested payment never occurred, the employee was terminated and served eight months in jail for merely requesting the bribe and quid pro quo.
No one is above the law. All public employees and elected officials must comply with federal regulations, without the appearance of a conflict of interest. This former employee lost her job and was jailed. Yet we have a president who remains in his job despite violating federal laws.

Hasbro announces line of Baby Yoda toys, melts hearts of mega-fans

Texto completo: Buy them, they will.
At least, that's what Hasbro is banking on.
The Rhode Island-based toy company announced this week that it's rolling out a line of “Baby Yoda" toys next year, answering the pleas of fans of the Disney+ series “The Mandalorian," who have been fawning over the doe-eyed character since the the show's November launch and looking to get their hands on some official merchandise.
"We know 'Star Wars' fans around the world will be thrilled to see this beloved character incorporated into the Hasbro 'Star Wars' collection of products," Samantha Lomow, president of Hasbro Entertainment Brands, said in a statement Thursday, when the company unveiled images of the new toys.
She said Hasbro has been “so enamored with the conversation and fan reaction" to the character, which is officially called “The Child" but has been referred to colloquially as Baby Yoda.
The product line for “The Child" features four different toys: a “cuddly plush toy" that makes sounds; a posable 6.5-inch figure; six smaller collectible figures; and a 1.12-inch collectible action figure that comes with accessories. Prices vary.
On the show, Baby Yoda is a mysterious alien pursued from planet to planet by bounty hunters. But on earth, the pint-sized character is so popular that it appears poised to unite our divided nation.
Just how popular is it? Well, Baby Yoda has become the subject of countless Internet memes and online chatter since its debut on the Star Wars spinoff. Sign on to Twitter or Instagram on any given day and it would be difficult to scroll very far before encountering an image of it staring back out at you, like a puppy looking for a treat.
Vanity Fair declared last month that “Baby Yoda Has Conquered the World," calling the newest addition to the franchise “an instant and indelible pop-culture phenomenon" that had people clamoring for merchandise.
The New Yorker shared one of its famed cartoons to Twitter, praising the character's cuteness. The drawing depicted a mother looking down at her baby in a carriage, saying, “No offense, but Baby Yoda, like, blows you out of the water."
A New York Times headline was even more direct: “Baby Yoda Is Your God Now."
And as The Hollywood Reporter pointed out, some people joked that Baby Yoda would — or perhaps should — be named Time magazine's “Person of the Year." While Baby Yoda didn't make the cover, it did appear in the publication's inside pages with Disney CEO Bob Iger.
Unfortunately, people who want to bring home the toys won't see them in time for the holidays. Disney intentionally held off on releasing Baby Yoda toys so his first appearance in “The Mandalorian" would be a surprise.
“It was important to us that the reveal of the new character, the Child, be a special moment for fans," Paul Southern, SVP of licensing and franchise for Lucasfilm, said in a previous statement, "and we could not be more thrilled with the response."
Preorders of Hasbro's upcoming products launched this week and can be made through several retailers, according to the company. The product line is expected to start shipping in May next year. There's also the promise of additional Hasbro toys and games featuring Baby Yoda, which “will be revealed in the coming months."
Star Wars announced on its website Thursday that items are also up for presale from Funko, Mattel, and Buffalo Games.

Texto completo: At an appeals hearing in Boston, lawyers for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, condemned to death in the bombing, argued that trial errors corrupted the case.
BOSTON -- During the days after bombs exploded at the Boston Marathon in 2013, killing and maiming people who had gathered to cheer on runners, a restaurant manager from Dorchester joined the chorus of heartbreak and outrage on Twitter.
":-( RIP little man," wrote the woman, who used the handle HerLadyship, of an 8-year-old boy from her neighborhood who had been killed. She sympathized with Twitter friends forced to "shelter in place" during the manhunt, but also said "it's worse having to work knowing your family is locked down!"
When a 19-year-old named Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was arrested after the attack, HerLadyship retweeted a post from someone who praised "all of the law enforcement professionals who went through hell to bring in that piece of garbage."
More than six years later, those casual posts -- by the woman who became the forewoman of Mr. Tsarnaev's jury -- could become the basis for reversing his death sentence.
At an appeal hearing on Thursday, a panel of federal judges raised sharp questions about whether Judge George A. O'Toole, who presided over Mr. Tsarnaev's trial in 2015, had adequately screened jurors for bias.
They zeroed in on a moment when Judge O'Toole learned that two sitting jurors had failed to disclose tweets and Facebook posts about Mr. Tsarnaev, and opted not to question them in detail about it or remove them from the jury.
"It's just very puzzling," said Judge William J. Kayatta Jr., in remarks to a government prosecutor. "You have a defendant who is clearly guilty of this heinous crime and you then stretch and don't try to follow the rules that we've laid down for a trial."
The line of questioning was echoed by Judge Ojetta Rogeriee Thompson, who asked why the judge did not screen jurors in detail about where they received information about Mr. Tsarnaev.
"Why isn't this the kind of case that would require probing that kind of information," she said, "such that not doing so, even if it's not an abuse of law, is simply an abuse of discretion because the circumstances simply require it?"
Their questions offered a grain of hope to Mr. Tsarnaev's defense team, which has argued that it was impossible to select an impartial jury in Boston, a city that had been steeped in powerful emotions over the bombings and deluged with pretrial publicity.
The federal death sentence was a rare event in Massachusetts, which has no death penalty for state crimes.
Mr. Tsarnaev and his older brother set down two pressure-cooker bombs packed with nails and BBs in a crowd that had gathered to cheer on marathon runners on April 13, 2013.
The bombs killed three people and injured 260 more, many of them grievously. Seventeen people lost limbs. A fourth person, a law enforcement officer, was killed a few days later as the brothers were fleeing.
Ahead of the trial, two years later, Judge O'Toole denied three motions for a change of venue, arguing that he could easily select impartial jurors from a pool of five million people.
The defense has argued that two jurors had clearly demonstrated prejudice against Mr. Tsarnaev.
Before the trial, Juror 286, a restaurant manager who was chosen as forewoman of the jury, had tweeted or retweeted 22 posts about the bombing, including the one that described Mr. Tsarnaev as "a piece of garbage," Mr. Tsarnaev's lawyers say. Efforts by The New York Times to reach the forewoman were unsuccessful.
Juror 138, a man who worked for the Peabody Water Department, had posted on Facebook that he was in the jury pool for the case. One friend wrote that "if you're really on jury duty, this guys got no shot in hell." Another wrote, "play the part so u get on the jury then send him to jail where he will be taken care of."
On the day of sentencing, the defense team's brief said, Juror 138 said on Twitter that Mr. Tsarnaev was "scum" and "trash," and that he belonged in a "dungeon where he will be forgotten about until his time comes." The former juror declined a request for comment from The Times.
Thursday's arguments represent the first step in a process that will probably last for years. The arguments are constrained to the trial record, and must establish that the judge or prosecutors erred in some way that is significant enough to merit a reversal, a high bar since judges are typically granted broad discretion.
Discussions of the legal questions returned again and again to social media, and the increasing difficulty of sealing off jurors from prejudicial information.
Daniel Habib, a lawyer for Mr. Tsarnaev, said the screening rules were from an era before social media, and were even more necessary now, when potential jurors are immersed in "all manner of opinion and fact and suggestion and innuendo about this case."
"It wasn't just that they were reading The Boston Globe," Mr. Habib said. "They were hearing from their family and their friends and complete strangers on Twitter, on Facebook, on Instagram, and any other social media they participated in, thoughts about the case and beliefs about Tsarnaev."
Sources of pretrial publicity, he said, "have multiplied, and are less checked."
Prosecutors have pushed back against the defense arguments, saying that Juror 138 "never endorsed" the "flippant and joking remarks" left by his friends on Facebook, and that Juror 286 may have failed to disclose her Twitter posts because she misunderstood the instruction.
George Vien, a former federal prosecutor who now works at the law firm Donnelly, Conroy & Gelhaar, said he did not believe that the evidence of prejudice was strong.
"I think everyone should stay off social media, but I don't find it compelling," he said. "If you look at the overwhelming evidence against him, and all the aggravating factors, it's easy to understand why an impartial jury would have come down on the side of the death penalty."
One of the jurors, Kelley A. McCarthy, said in an interview that she believed that the jury had been open-minded and had not been biased by media coverage about the bombings.
"That was one thing the judge was very careful about, that there wasn't that bias," she said. "I think we did it fairly, rationally."
She said she was surprised to learn of social media posts by the forewoman, and said that the forewoman had not had a significant influence on other members of the jury.
"She was not a huge influencer on that trial," she said. "I mean every single person on the trial had their own free will, and she wasn't somebody who was persuading anybody, other than what the facts were."
Liz Norden, the mother of two men who lost legs in the bombing, said a reversal of the verdict or sentence would be a bitter disappointment.
"I think he got a fair trial," she said. "His defense attorney said he did it. He said he did it. There was no place in the world where you could take it where it would be different. He terrorized a nation."
Ms. Norden, who is 57, said seeing Mr. Tsarnaev executed is "my only hope in life now."
"For the human part of me, it's a sad situation to wish death on anyone," she said. "That's not in my makeup. I'm not an eye for an eye. But in this instance, I felt from Day 1 if he was found guilty, that's what I wanted. That's what I thought justice would be."
She added, "I personally hope I live long enough to see it."

Texto completo: He told a judge that he "sold his soul" in working as President Trump's lawyer.
Michael D. Cohen says he has been left disbarred, financially crushed and personally embarrassed and humiliated after being sentenced to three years in prison for federal crimes. He says he regrets that he thought "being Donald Trump's lawyer made him a 'big man."'
Mr. Cohen, the disgraced former lawyer and fixer for President Trump, made the comments in a letter to a federal judge on Wednesday in which he portrayed himself as a broken man and asked the court to allow him to serve the remainder of his sentence in home confinement.
Mr. Cohen, 53, began serving his sentence in May and is in a minimum-security camp at the Federal Correctional Institution in Otisville, N.Y., about 75 miles northwest of New York City.
Mr. Cohen wrote that he now realizes, as he walks the Otisville Camp paths, that he "in fact 'sold his soul,' and foolishly frittered away his integrity."
Mr. Cohen's lawyers supplemented his request to the judge, William H. Pauley III of Federal District Court, with strongly written attacks on Attorney General William P. Barr and the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, which prosecuted Mr. Cohen.
One lawyer, Roger B. Adler, accused the government of refusing to consider sponsoring Mr. Cohen for a sentence reduction based on his cooperation "because his testimony leads directly down a pathway to possible indictment" of Mr. Trump, his family organization, family members and his "enablers."
Mr. Adler offered no evidence to support his claim about the prosecution's motives.
Another of Mr. Cohen's lawyers, Lanny J. Davis, said in an emailed statement that he questioned whether Mr. Barr had "interfered and influenced the decision not to credit Mr. Cohen for all his cooperation in bringing the facts out publicly about Mr. Trump's wrongdoing."
Mr. Cohen's lawyers also asked Judge Pauley to order a hearing "to explore, evaluate and quantify the cooperation" that they say Mr. Cohen has provided to the government.
A Southern District spokesman declined to comment on Wednesday; the office is expected to respond to Mr. Cohen's motion in a court filing. A representative for Mr. Barr also declined to comment. The White House did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment.
Mr. Cohen had pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations, tax evasion and other crimes in connection with a scheme to pay hush money to buy the silence of two women who said they had affairs with Mr. Trump. The president has denied the affairs.
The Southern District, in a court filing in July, said it was unlikely it would file additional charges in the hush-money investigation and that it had "effectively concluded" the inquiry.
In their motion on Wednesday, Mr. Cohen's lawyers said Mr. Cohen had been a model prisoner and could ordinarily be expected to serve about one more year in prison before he would be transferred to a halfway house or other form of community confinement.
Before Mr. Cohen was sentenced a year ago, the Southern District prosecutors told Judge Pauley that they had met with Mr. Cohen and that he had been "forthright and credible" and provided potentially "useful information."
But they said they had not provided him with a formal cooperation deal because he "specifically declined to be debriefed on other uncharged criminal conduct, if any, in his past." He had also "declined to meet with the office about other areas of investigative interest," they said.
In his request to the judge on Wednesday, Mr. Cohen listed cooperation he had provided to offices like the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, and, more recently, congressional committees.
Defendants can seek reduced sentences based on new information they provide to the government after they are sentenced.
Mr. Cohen's lawyers said in the court filing that they had met and spoken by phone with Southern District prosecutors repeatedly this year, to explore how Mr. Cohen might cooperate and earn the office's support for a post-sentencing reduction.
They said Mr. Cohen was offering "valuable information" about alleged misconduct related to Mr. Trump and the Trump Organization. The prosecutors ultimately rejected their proposal, they said.

Texto completo: "My Brilliant Friend" and Elena Ferrante's other best-selling books are inspiring female novelists and shaking up the country's male-dominated literary establishment.
ROME -- In Italy, literary fiction has long been considered a man's game. Publishers, critics and prize committees have dismissed books by women as chick lit and beach reads. They scoffed at Elena Ferrante, the author of "My Brilliant Friend," as the writer of mere page-turners.
Then Ferrante's Neapolitan novels became an international sensation, selling over 11 million copies, inspiring an acclaimed HBO series and cementing her reputation as the most successful Italian novelist in years. Her ascent, and the rediscovery of some of the last century's great Italian female writers, has encouraged a new wave of women and shaken the country's literary establishment. Women writers here are winning prestigious prizes, getting translated and selling copies.
Their achievements have set off a wider debate in Italy about what constitutes literature in a country where self-referential virtuosity is often valued over storytelling, emotional resonance and issues like sexism or gender roles.
"Once we were more reluctant to write about certain topics, fearing they could be labeled as 'women's stuff,"' said Veronica Raimo, author of the novel "The Girl at the Door," an exploration of marriage, pregnancy and sexual assault allegations that was translated into English this year. "There was this idea that stories told by women couldn't be universal. But that's changing."
One author to see the progress firsthand is Helena Janeczek, who has been publishing for decades but who last year became the first woman in 15 years to win the Premio Strega, the country's top literary award.
"That was quite a time gap, wasn't it?" she said. "But I wasn't that surprised. The times are changing."
The book that won her the award, published in October in English as "The Girl With the Leica," is a historical novel about the war photographer Gerda Taro, who was killed in 1937 while documenting the Spanish Civil War with her more famous boyfriend and colleague, Robert Capa.
In the past two years, novels by women have accounted for roughly half of Italy's top 20 best sellers in fiction -- nearly double the percentage from 2017, according to data released by Informazioni Editoriali, which surveys sales in the country's bookshops.
In interviews, Italian authors, editors, critics, translators and publishers said that women writers have gained extraordinary attention. Some call it "the Ferrante effect."
"My Brilliant Friend" and the other Ferrante novels (her latest, "La Vita Bugiarda Degli Adulti," came out in Italian last month and is slated for publication in English as "The Lying Life of Adults" next year) showed that "there is a market for fiction by women," said Daniela Brogi, a contemporary literature scholar at the University for Foreigners of Siena. "And they also gave literary dignity to fiction about women."
Establishment critics were previously quick to disregard stories about the bonds between women. That has changed.
Three much-discussed recent books delve into mother-daughter relationships. Donatella Di Pietrantonio's "A Girl, Returned," released last summer in English, is a coming-of-age story set in rural Southern Italy. Claudia Durastanti's "La Straniera" ("The Stranger") recalls her upbringing in a dysfunctional family between Brooklyn and Basilicata. Nadia Terranova's novel "Addio Fantasmi" ("Goodbye Ghosts") tells the story of a 30-something woman facing her painful past on a trip home to see her mother. Both of those are being translated into English.
Raimo, the author of "The Girl at the Door," said that younger readers in Italy have become more open to women writers partly as a result of having read women in translation.
"They know there are countries in which having someone like Jennifer Egan or Zadie Smith is normal," she said.
But many of the new wave of women writers attribute their momentum to the pseudonymous Ferrante, who has guarded her anonymity even as her books have become best sellers. (Some people speculate that Ferrante could be Anita Raja, a prominent literary translator married to the novelist Domenico Starnone, and they have looked for evidence of his hand in her work.)
Beyond the guessing game, Ferrante has generated international interest in Italian writers overall.
"There's a global buzz about contemporary Italian writers, including many women and even minorities, and we owe a lot to her for that," said Igiaba Scego, a Somali-Italian writer. Her novel "Beyond Babylon," which explores the traumas of the immigrant experience through the eyes of two women, was translated into English this year after being published in Italy a decade ago.
Some new translations of Italian works reach back even further.
A new English translation of "Family Lexicon," the 1963 masterpiece by Natalia Ginzburg, came out in 2017. Three more of her novels were reissued this year, two of them in new translations. Another major writer from Italy's postwar period, Elsa Morante (whom Ferrante has cited as a source of inspiration), is likewise getting a fresh look, with a new translation this year of her coming-of-age classic, "Arturo's Island."
And yet, Italian women writers still face obstacles.
"The problem is not getting published or selling copies," Janeczek said. "It's getting recognition."
She said that women have generally been kept far from the Italian canon, and that Ferrante's success overseas is not likely to get her much closer. "When she had all that recognition abroad, our critics said 'Look, those Americans think she's a great writer,"' Janeczek said.
In 2015, as Ferrante was receiving enormous acclaim, the novelist Francesco Longo wrote in the Roman newspaper Il Messaggero that "Ferrante is a powerful storyteller. But not a writer."
Some of Italy's female critics think their male counterparts are missing the point.
Tiziana de Rogatis, a critic whose book on Ferrante's diction came out in the United States this month, said that Ferrante, like Morante, is a sophisticated thinker and writer who chooses to write plainly and empathetically to be understood. Academia, she said, eventually catches up with great authors "first popular with the public."
Some writers and literature professors argue that dusty elitism, more than overt sexism, hinders women from being recognized.
"There is a widespread idea here that literary fiction should be virtuoso and self-referential," said Elisa Gambaro, a scholar at the University of Milan. As a result, fiction that is commercially successful is often disparaged.
But some women say it should be the other way around.
"To put it bluntly, women writers tend to be less self-referential, because they're less used to thinking of themselves as the center of the world," said Brogi, the contemporary literature scholar at the University for Foreigners of Siena. She said women developed literary language to make themselves better understood -- and incidentally, easier to translate -- because they were so often ignored. It was a condition, she said, that Ferrante had eloquently coined as "smarginatura," or, roughly put, being pushed to the margins.
But this new crop of women writers is pushing toward the center.
"We are standing up for each other, and calling out the double standards," Durastanti said. "This sense of sisterhood wasn't there a few years ago."
Terranova said the results were already there to see.
"Italy always had great women writers," she said. "The truly new thing is that, for the first time, they're getting recognition."
Correction : Dec. 9, 2019
An earlier version of this article misstated the setting of the book "La Straniera." It is between Brooklyn and Basilicata, not Brooklyn and Abruzzo.

Texto completo: Iran's government has acknowledged that it faced a "very big" cyberattack, following a report in The New York Times this week that information from 15 million Iranian bank accounts was stolen and published online after widespread street protests were crushed in November.
Iran's telecommunication minister, Mohammad Javad Azari Jahromi -- who had previously dismissed the bank-account theft as an insider extortion plot -- said the attack had been state sponsored, but he offered no evidence to back up the claim. He said details and the country deemed responsible would be revealed after investigations had been completed.
Mr. Azari Jahromi said Iran's cybersecurity unit had thwarted the attack, making no direct mention of the compromised bank accounts.
"We faced a very well-coordinated state-sponsored cyberattack on the government's digital infrastructure," Mr. Azari Jahromi told reporters in Tehran on Wednesday. "It was a very big attack."
He made the announcement the same day that Telegram, the popular phone app widely used in Iran, shut down the channel where the bank account details had been revealed for all to see.
The Telegram channel was created on Nov. 27 and until Dec. 5 had been home to the uploaded names and details for debit cards tied to the accounts of millions of Iranians who are clients of three banks -- Mellat, Tejarat and Sarmayeh.
All three were the target of United States sanctions a year earlier over what American officials described as prohibited financial transfers done on behalf of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.
"We routinely close down channels which publish personal data like passport scans or credit card numbers," said Markus Ra, spokesman for Telegram. This channel was closed, he said, when a user reported it to the company after the publication of The Times article.
A week earlier, Mr. Azari Jahromi had characterized the breaching of the bank accounts as the act of a disgruntled former contractor he said had obtained access to the information and was using it for extortion. As of Thursday, the banks had not issued a public statement about the breached accounts.
But it appeared the problem continued even after the channel was erased from Telegram.
Some Iranians posted screenshots of emails they had received from accounts with addresses identical to the customer service departments at two of the banks. The emails showed the account holders' personal identification details and warned them: "We are in control of your bank information and your bank is lying to you."
The emails advised these customers to take immediate action but did not specify what it should be. One Iranian said on Twitter that some of these emails contained an attachment file with the numbers of millions of leaked accounts.
An Iranian cybersecurity expert based in New York, Amir Rashidi, said he had traced the emails to a server in Germany.
Cybersecurity experts said that a breach of this magnitude could have been the work of a state actor, although there have been sophisticated attacks on Western banking systems that turned out to be organized by criminal groups.
They also said there was always the possibility that the attack had been the work of an insider.
Iranian media said the attack was the largest banking security breach in Iran's history.
While there is constant cyberconflict between the United States and Iran, American financial institutions and the Federal Reserve have long been leery of offensive actions by the United States government against other countries' financial systems. They fear that might legitimize reprisals against American accounts.
For Iran, the breach is the latest in a wave of challenges.
In the past month, Iran announced it was facing a significant budget deficit because of American economic sanctions, it crushed nationwide demonstrations with a deadly response that has been widely criticized, and it contended with growing regional resentment. That is especially the case in Iraq, where Iran has exerted significant influence.
Experts said that the bank breach, at the very least, could create a crisis of public trust with the country's financial institutions.
Boaz Dolev, chief executive of ClearSky, a cybersecurity company that was among the first outside Iran to spot the banking breach, said he believed the affected banks had deliberately kept quiet. Mr. Dolev speculated that the banks did not cancel the accounts "because they do not want to panic the public or they will find it very difficult to issue new cards."
In Israel -- which, like the United States, has engaged in cyberconflict with Iran -- news about the banking breach raised suspicions that Iran might blame Israel and take revenge. An Israeli banking official said two of the country's biggest banks on Wednesday raised their cyberattack warnings to "top alert."
A Middle Eastern intelligence official who tracks Iran and opposes its foreign policy said that over the past week top Iranian intelligence agencies, including the large cyberunit inside Iran's Ministry of Intelligence, had been trying to track down the source of the banking breach and those behind the creation of the now-erased Telegram channel.
The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters, said the security authorities in Iran were taking a serious stance on the breach and believe it had increased the potential for a renewed flare-up of antigovernment demonstrations, given the "damage to many citizens and the regime's failure to prevent such information leaks."

Texto completo: Every purchase evokes his design of the rectangular Universal Product Code. But although it became ubiquitous, he received no royalties.
George J. Laurer, whose design of the vertically striped bar code sped supermarket checkout lines, parcel deliveries and assembly lines and even transformed human beings, including airline passengers and hospital patients, into traceable inventory items, died on Dec. 5 at his home in Wendell, N.C., near Raleigh. He was 94.
His death was confirmed by his son Craig.
The Universal Product Code made its official debut in 1974, when a scanner registered 67 cents for a 10-pack of Wrigley's Juicy Fruit chewing gum at a Marsh supermarket in Troy, Ohio. (One of the original scanners is at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History; the package of gum was bought and retained by a Marsh executive.)
"It was cheap, and it was needed," Mr. Laurer told The New York Times in 2009. "And it is reliable."
And it revolutionized commerce.
The bar code had evolved over several decades, a product of several collaborators and some fluky coincidences.
The first to lend his expertise was N. Joseph Woodland, an alumnus of the Manhattan Project, developer of the atomic bomb. As an undergraduate at what is now Drexel University in Philadelphia, he had perfected an efficient system for playing music in elevators and planned to market it commercially until his father intervened, insisting that the elevator music industry was controlled by organized crime.
Mr. Woodland was earning a master's degree at Drexel in the late 1940s when a supermarket executive visiting the university's engineering school urged students there to develop a practical means of digitally storing product data. With a classmate, Bernard Silver, Mr. Woodland devised a circular symbol resembling a bull's-eye in which the information could be encoded. But they were ahead of their time: Commercial scanners and microprocessors that could interpret the code were not yet widely available.
In 1951, after abandoning a planned career as a television repairman, Mr. Laurer joined IBM, where he was asked to design a code for food labels modeled on the Woodland-Silver bull's-eye and compatible with a new generation of optical scanners. But he found that the circular symbol was too blurry when reproduced on high-speed printing presses; instead he developed a rectangular design, with 95 bits of data in binary code containing consumer product information.
Enter Alan L. Haberman, a supermarket executive who headed the Uniform Grocery Product Code Council, which had been organized to choose a universal product code symbol. He favored Mr. Laurer's design, but the members of his committee were split.
Mr. Haberman reconciled their differences over dinner at a San Francisco restaurant and then invited them to a screening of the X-rated film "Deep Throat." In April 1973, the committee unanimously voted for the bar code that has appeared on billions of items since. (The original carried an 11-digit formula -- six identifying the manufacturer and five identifying the product; a 12th digit was added later as a check.)
The bar code increased the speed of checkout lines by some 40 percent, eliminated labor-intensive placement of price tags on every product, and resulted in fewer register errors and more efficient inventory controls. But Mr. Laurer often said that he was amazed at how omnipresent it became.
The code even made a cameo appearance in presidential politics and became lodged in urban legend.
During the 1992 primary campaign, it was widely reported, in The New York Times and elsewhere, that President George Bush was so out of touch with average Americans that he was baffled by a supermarket bar code scanner he encountered at a grocers' convention. (It turned out to be a prototype of an advanced version that was not yet commonly available.)
Some fundamentalist Christians have also noted that the so-called three guard bars at the beginning, end and middle of the code resemble the numeral 6, suggesting the number 666, which the Book of Revelation links to an apocalypse.
"It is simply a coincidence," Mr. Laurer said, "like the fact that my first, middle and last name all have six letters."
George Joseph Laurer III was born on Sept. 23, 1925, in Manhattan. His father was a lawyer who became a Navy electrical engineer. His mother, Irma (Rudiger) Laurer, provided day care.
George was raised in New Jersey and Baltimore, contracted polio as a teenager and was drafted into the Army during World War II before he had finished high school.
Discharged as a technical sergeant, he was collecting unemployment checks when he enrolled in a radio and TV repair course. After one year, he was persuaded by his instructor to quit, take a high school equivalency exam and enroll in college.
He graduated from the University of Maryland with a bachelor of science degree in electrical engineering in 1951. He also earned amateur radio and private pilot's licenses.
Mr. Laurer married Marilyn Slocum in 1954. She died in 2013. In addition to his son Craig, he is survived by two other sons, Mark and Jonathan; a daughter, Debra Laurer Cook; three grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren. His sister, Alma Laurer Albert, died earlier.
Mr. Laurer worked for IBM at the Research Triangle Park in North Carolina until 1987. He received 26 patents, including one for a hand-held scanner that reads bar codes. But he earned no royalties from the bar code; IBM did not patent it.
From the beginning, he said, the biggest challenge was to make each printed bar code, along with the optical and laser technology that scanned it, more reliable than a human cashier.
"We learned that people will forgive the cute little grocery store clerk if she mischarges by a few cents," he said. "If the clerk charges you 97 cents instead of 79 cents, no big deal -- that's O.K., it's no real problem. But we don't forgive computers, no matter how bad they are."

Texto completo: Fairlight Art Ventures must give the auction house about $ 6 million.
A British court ruled on Wednesday that an art investment firm, Fairlight Art Ventures, was liable for its role selling a painting attributed to the Dutch old master Frans Hals that was later deemed a forgery. The company must reimburse about $ 6 million to Sotheby's, the auction house that brokered the sale, the court said.
"The nice thing is that court decided in Sotheby's favor on every single point," a Sotheby's lawyer, Paul Lomas, said in a telephone interview. "It was, in that sense, a very strong result."
Fairlight did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
David Kowitz, the founder of Fairlight, and Mark Weiss, a London art dealer, bought the painting as a Frans Hals in 2010, and asked Sotheby's to broker a private sale of the work. The auction house sold it for $ 10.75 million to the American art collector Richard Hedreen. Fairlight and Mr. Weiss shared the $ 10.75 million in revenues, and Sotheby's earned an additional commission as the broker of the deal.
In 2016, after rumors of other potential forgeries in the world of European old master paintings circulated in the art world, the buyer asked Sotheby's to seek an independent assessment of the painting. A study conducted by Orion Analytical, a scientific analysis firm (later acquired by Sotheby's), found that the painting was "undoubtedly a forgery."
Sotheby's reimbursed Mr. Hedreen the $ 10.75 million sale price, but Fairlight and Mr. Weiss did not pay Sotheby's back their earnings from the sale, arguing that the painting was genuine.
In a statement Mr. Weiss sent to The New York Times on Wednesday, he said he was sure the painting was not a forgery. "I have always believed and maintained that the painting was by Frans Hals," he wrote. "The painting was bought and sold in good faith."
Mr. Lomas said Sotheby's and Mr. Weiss came to an independent settlement a few weeks before the trial began earlier this year. Mr. Weiss will pay Sotheby's "several million dollars," he said, although he did not say the exact amount. Fairlight argued that it was not an official partner in the sale, and continued to fight the case independently in court.
In the verdict on Wednesday, the court did not weigh in on the question of the painting's authenticity. "This judgment does not determine whether the painting is by Frans Hals," the verdict states. "Whether by Frans Hals or not, it is to be hoped that its intrinsic qualities will not be ignored, and that it might be enjoyed for what it is, which is a fine painting."

Texto completo: NEW YORK (AP) - An 18-year-old Barnard freshman has been fatally stabbed in a park in Manhattan, sending shock waves through the college and wider Columbia University community.
“With broken hearts, we share tragic news about the death of one of our students," Barnard President Sian Leah Beilock said late Wednesday in a letter to the campus. “This is an unthinkable tragedy that has shaken us to our core."
The letter identified the student as Tessa Majors and said she was fatally wounded during an armed robbery near Barnard's campus. Barnard College is part of Columbia University.
Police said they responded to an assault report at around 5:30 p.m. and found an unconscious woman, who had been stabbed multiple times. She died at a hospital.
There have been no arrests.
The teen's parents, who live in Charlottesville, Virginia, headed to New York after learning the tragic news, her grandparents told New York's Daily News.
Her grandfather, Andrew Burton, called her “a lovely, lovely girl - very, very smart and sweet.”
Isabel Jauregui, a Barnard student who works on the Columbia Spectator campus newspaper, told The New York Times that students were on edge.
“My friend is throwing up in the bathroom,” she said. “She’s so scared.”
Counselors were being made available.
“In these difficult circumstances, it is important for us to take care of each other," Beilock wrote. “Please hold Tessa and her family in your hearts and keep each other close."

Texto completo: The child became separated from his mother at a financial district station during the evening rush hour.
A 2-year-old boy was fatally hit by a subway train in Lower Manhattan on Wednesday after he became separated from his mother at one of New York City's busiest stations during the evening commute, officials said.
The boy and his mother were at the Fulton Street station at around 5:30 p.m. when he somehow slipped away from her and into the path of a northbound No. 2 train, the police said. The Fire Department also responded to the station for a report of a patient "pinned by a train," officials said.
The boy was taken to NewYork-Presbyterian Lower Manhattan Hospital in critical condition, fire officials said. He was subsequently pronounced dead, the police said.
Andy Byford, the president of the New York City Transit Authority, said in a statement that the boy "apparently became separated from his mother" before being hit by the train and that "the circumstances surrounding the incident remain under investigation."
"Our hearts break for the family," Mr. Byford said, adding that "our thoughts are with the crew of the train as well." He said that members of the crew had been taken to a hospital and "were totally traumatized by this incident."
The police said that they would need to examine video footage and interview the mother and other witnesses before determining how the boy, whose name was not released, had come into contact with the train.
Service on the No. 2 and 3 lines was disrupted for some time as a result of the accident, and trains were bypassing Fulton Street on those lines in both directions as of 9 p.m., according to transit officials.
The Fulton Street station, where eight lines converge near Wall Street, was the city's fifth-busiest station last year, with 93,000 riders passing through on an average weekday. Its platforms are often crowded around the time the accident happened, as workers flood out of financial district offices for the commute home.
It is rare for a child to be struck by a train, but the problem of people who wind up on the tracks or are hit after getting too close to a train while on a platform has been growing in recent years.
In 2017, the most recent year for which complete data was available, there were nearly 900 such incidents. As of September 2018, the system was on pace to top that number for the full year.
On Dec. 8, two women who had gotten off an A train at the Broadway Junction station in Brooklyn just after midnight fell off the edge of the platform and between cars as the same train left the station, the police said. One of the women was killed.
In 2017, 43 instances of people on tracks were believed to involve suicides or attempted suicides, subway officials said.
In September, a Bronx man was killed and his 5-year-old daughter sustained minor injuries after he jumped from a platform into the path of a moving train while holding onto the girl during the morning rush, the police said.

Texto completo: The elderly airplane sits in the restoration hangar with its wings off and its tail removed as the Smithsonian's photographers document each section.
It's a rickety contraption that its conservators say feels like a barn with engines.
The toilet consists of a metal bucket with a seat. Its wings once carried luggage. And its corrugated metal skin earned it the nickname 'the tin goose.'
The three-engine Ford Tri-Motor was caked in grime when the institution's Mary Baker Engen Restoration Hangar got it from the National Air and Space Museum in downtown Washington three months ago. There, it had hung from the ceiling with two mannequins in the cockpit for 43 years.
Now it has been disassembled, scrubbed and studied as a part of a massive overhaul of the museum that has seen 65 airplanes moved off exhibit in Washington to a new $60 million storage facility at the Smithsonian's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Va.
Most of the western half of the popular museum on the Mall has closed to the public for construction, deputy director Chris Browne said. Reopening is planned for 2022.
About 2,000 artifacts, including 65 historic aircraft, have been trucked to the museum's new Dulles Collections Center " often in the middle of the night when traffic was light.
The three-floor, 90,000-square-foot center, adjacent to Dulles International Airport, was built to house the artifacts. The center opened last January, when the first objects arrived, and is almost at capacity, said Douglas O. Erickson, chief of the museum's collections processing unit.
The vast building is now filled with storage boxes, airplane parts and oddball items:
l The Explorer II gondola, which, while suspended from a balloon, reached a record-setting altitude of 72,000 feet in 1935.
l The large model of the doomed German airship Hindenburg, which blew up at Lakehurst, N.J., in 1937. (The model was used the 1975 film 'The Hindenburg.')
Wings have been removed from planes to save space, and stored on special shelves. The camouflage wings of an Italian World War II Macchi fighter rest not far from those of a World War-I Spad, which have markings from German bullets.
The elegant wooden fuselage of a World War I German Albatros fighter is there, still bearing the mysterious slogan 'STROPP' on its side. The museum still is not sure what the word means.
Elsewhere, huge airplane engines sit covered in clear plastic.
A World War II Japanese Zero fighter, painted green and white, rests in a cradle, cushioned by foam.
And a large box is labeled 'Caution! Object Directly Behind Cardboard.'
The Ford Tri-Motor " the Smithsonian's dates to 1929 " sits in the restoration hangar next door.
In the 1920s and early '30s, the airplane was the latest in air travel and was the first practical airliner in the United States, the museum said.
It had a 420-horsepower piston engine on each wing and one in its nose. Passenger seats were made of wicker. The Smithsonian's still bears the old blue and orange insignia of American Airways.
The plane has a single row of seats on either side of the cabin and could carry about a dozen passengers. But museum expert Bob van der Linden said the aircraft could be hot, noisy and bumpy in flight. 'You're bouncing all over the sky, so airsickness was a constant problem,' he said in a museum video about the plane.
As for the toilet, 'it's a five-gallon pail basically with a nice toilet seat on it,' Luke Jones, the hangar's restoration shop supervisor, said last week as the photographers documented the plane.
'This has been in here three months, now,' Jones said. 'My guys actually had to go on top of the wing. They had to scrub the corrugated metal trying to get [the dirt] out. Every single little piece. Every cable gets polished up and treated to make sure it doesn't rust.
'The wings have already been done,' he said, adding that he was amazed to find that they doubled as luggage compartments. 'That's not something you see,' he said. 'I've been around [old airplanes] my whole life, worked on them for at least the last 20 years. I had never known those were in there.
'That's probably the most unique thing about this airplane, outside of three engines,' he said.
'Oddly enough, you would think with three engines it would be able to carry itself for a while,' Jones said. But if 'one engine goes down in this, they've got to put it down. It is so poorly engineered.'
But in its day it was a prince of the skies.
Adm. Richard E. Byrd flew a Ford Tri-Motor on his record-setting trip to the South Pole in 1929.
That same year, billiards champion Ralph Greenleaf played for an hour aboard a Ford Tri-Motor flying over Detroit. Organizers of the stunt predicted that billiards might be added to recreational activities on airliners, according to news reports.
Ford Tri-Motors thrilled audiences at air shows, and one set a world speed record for multi-engine planes in 1930. Top speed: 164.4 mph. Modern airliners fly at about 500 mph.
In 1932, future president Franklin D. Roosevelt, in a dramatic gesture, flew in one from Albany, N.Y., to Chicago to deliver his acceptance speech after being nominated by the Democrats. (The flight was rough, with no seat belts for passengers, and many in Roosevelt's party were airsick, according to the Virginia Aviation History Project.)
But the airplane could also be deadly.
On Dec. 2, 1928, a Ford Tri-Motor crashed in Spur, Tex., killing five people. Three months later, on March 17, 1929, 14 people were killed when one crashed into a rail yard near Newark on a sightseeing flight. The plane struck a freight car and broke in two.
At the time it was believed to be the deadliest plane crash in the United States, the New York Times reported.
In 1931, Ford's chief test pilot and a company mechanic were killed when an experimental Tri-Motor configured as a bomber crashed outside Detroit. That same year, six people were killed in Cincinnati when one lost a propeller and crashed on takeoff.
Last week, as the photographers worked, museum aeronautics specialist Bridget Clark stood nearby cleaning a part for another airplane.
She had helped lower the Tri-Motor to the floor of the Air and Space museum and take it apart, she said.
'The really cool thing about all these planes [is] every single one of them is different,' she said. They have personalities 'and scars.'
As for the Tri-Motor?
'It's super rickety, but also kind of industrial at the same time,' she said. 'There's a weird juxtaposition between its fragility . . . yet it's like a barn.'
The airplane cost $55,000 in 1929.
Over the years, the Smithsonian's Tri-Motor was flown by airlines in the United States, Nicaragua and Mexico, according to the museum. It later was used as a crop duster in Montana, and ferried cargo to Alaska.
Eventually it wound up back in Mexico, forlorn and turned into a dwelling beside a small airstrip. A wood-burning stove had been installed and a chimney stuck through a hole in the roof.
The airplane was recovered and restored by American Airlines in the 1960s, and given to the Smithsonian in 1962.
In a 1928 advertisement for the airplane, Ford described a Tri-Motor flight:
You experience a sensation that is . . . one of the most extraordinary man has ever felt.
You are transcending human nature.
You feel immeasurably superior to the crawling beings in the miniature world . . . two thousand feet below.

Texto completo: After two years of legal wrangling, Harvey Weinstein and the board of his bankrupt film studio have reached a tentative $25 million settlement agreement with dozens of his alleged sexual misconduct victims, a deal that would not require the Hollywood producer to admit wrongdoing or pay anything to his accusers himself, according to lawyers involved in the negotiations.
The proposed global legal accord has gotten preliminary approval from all the major parties involved, according to several lawyers. More than 30 actresses and former Weinstein employees, who have accused Weinstein of offenses ranging from sexual harassment to rape, would share in the payout — along with potential claimants who could join in coming months. The deal would bring to an end nearly every such lawsuit against him and his former company.
The settlement would require court approval and a final signoff by all parties. It would be paid by insurance companies representing the producer's former studio, the Weinstein Company. Because the business is in bankruptcy proceedings, the women have had to make their claims along with its creditors. The payout to the accusers would be part of an overall $47 million settlement intended to close out the company's obligations, according to a half-dozen lawyers, some of whom spoke about the proposed terms on the condition of anonymity.
Representatives for Weinstein declined to comment. Lawyers did not respond to requests for comment for board members and other parties.
Meanwhile, Weinstein's bail was increased from $1 million to $5 million on Wednesday over allegations he violated his pretrial release conditions by mishandling or disabling his electronic ankle monitor.
Judge James Burke warned the disgraced movie mogul that he'll face jail if other issues crop up. Weinstein, 67, leaned on a walker as he came and went from a New York City courthouse for the bail hearing, looking as frail and pained as he did at a court appearance last week.
Weinstein's lawyer said he is having back surgery Thursday to relieve pain from an August car crash and that he will recover in time for the Jan. 6 start of his trial on rape and sexual assault charges.
Weinstein is scheduled to be tried in New York in early January on charges of sexual assault involving two women. While his criminal prosecution has drawn public attention, the largely hidden negotiations over civil claims have been far more consequential for many of his accusers, who include women from the United States, Canada, Britain, and Ireland.
More than $12 million — one-quarter of the overall settlement package — would go toward some, but not all, legal costs for Weinstein; his brother, Bob; and other former members of their company's board, the lawyers said. The board members would be insulated from future liability, and the alleged victims would drop their claims against Weinstein and other executives.
Several plaintiffs' lawyers said Weinstein had claimed that he might soon file for personal bankruptcy.
The settlement would resolve lawsuits filed by dozens of women since 2017, when The New York Times exposed allegations of sexual harassment and abuse by Weinstein. Although the producer's accusers include some of the highest-profile women in the entertainment world, such as Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie, and Salma Hayek, none have joined the proceedings. A lawsuit by actress Ashley Judd, who has said she intends to take Weinstein to trial, would not be part of the deal.
Two women who have brought civil suits against Weinstein — Alexandra Canosa, a producer who used to work for him, and Wedil David, an actress — have walked away from the tentative deal and intend to challenge it, according to their lawyers.

Thomas L. Friedman: Trump must be impeached if our democracy is to survive

Texto completo: Impeaching a president is the most consequential thing our Congress can do — other than declaring war. So, after great consideration, I say: President Donald Trump not only should be impeached, he must be impeached if America’s democracy is to remain intact.
Why? Because the facts here are not in doubt — indeed Trump’s allies in the media and Congress have largely given up disputing them: Trump held up congressionally directed taxpayer funding to strengthen Ukraine’s military against Russia until the new Ukrainian president agreed to do what Trump called a “favor” — announce that Ukraine was investigating Trump’s most likely opponent in the 2020 presidential election, Joe Biden, and his son, who was involved with a Ukrainian gas company. Trump apparently thought that just the announcement of such an investigation would kill Biden’s campaign in its crib.
Generally speaking, I believe presidents should be elected and removed by the voters at the polls. But when I hear Trump defenders scream, “Impeachment subverts the will of the people,” I say: “Really? What the hell do you think Trump was doing in Ukraine?” He was subverting the will of the people by scheming to use our tax dollars to knock out his most feared opponent in the coming election — rather than trusting voters to do that.
The only reason the plot was aborted was that a whistleblower from the intelligence community drew attention to the president’s plan, forcing him to release the money to Ukraine — moments before his shakedown exploded into public view. Trump was like a bank robber with a gun to a teller’s head, who suddenly heard the police sirens approaching and ran off before he could stash the money in his bag.
So while the founders wanted to reserve removal of a president for elections by the people, they understood that there could be situations when removing a president might be necessary to protect and preserve our very framework for holding free and fair elections. That framework is the Constitution and the rule of law — and this is one of those situations.
If we say, as Republicans do, that what Trump did is not an impeachable offense, we are telling ourselves and every future president — in direct contradiction of what the founders wrote in the Constitution — that it is OK to enlist a foreign power to tilt the election your way. Can you imagine how much money candidates could raise from Saudi Arabia or China to tilt a future election their way, or how many cyberwarriors they could enlist from Russia or Iran to create fake news, suppress voting or spur outrage?
The integrity of our elections would be shattered, and we would never again have a legitimate president — a president, who, whether or not you liked him or her, was at least seen as legitimately elected. That would be a prescription for permanent political chaos, as no future presidents’ authority would be respected if they were elected on the basis of foreign interference.
But that is what Republicans are courting by blindly defending Trump’s indefensible enlistment of Ukraine’s help to take down Biden and by echoing Trump’s conspiracy theory — originated by Russian agents — that it was Ukraine that hacked the Democratic National Committee’s emails in 2016, not Russia. They also argue that the DNC’s server was shipped off to Ukraine before the FBI could look at it.
This is right out of “The Twilight Zone.”
Folks, can you imagine what Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, is saying to himself today? “I can’t believe my luck! I not only got Trump to parrot my conspiracy theories, I got his whole party to do it! And for free! Who ever thought Americans would so easily sell out their own Constitution for one man? My God, I have Russian lawmakers in my own parliament who’d quit before doing that. But it proves my point: America is no different from Russia, so spare me the lectures.”
If Congress were to do what Republicans demand — forgo impeaching this president for enlisting a foreign power to get him elected, after he refused to hand over any of the documents that Congress had requested and blocked all of his key aides who knew what happened from testifying — we would be saying that a president is henceforth above the law.
We would be saying that we no longer have three coequal branches of government. We would be saying that we no longer have a separation of powers.
We would be saying that our president is now a king.
If we do that, the America you studied in history class, the America you grew up knowing and loving, and the America that the rest of the world has so long admired as a beacon of democracy and justice will be no more. Oh, how we will miss it when it’s gone.
At a time when virtually every Republican lawmaker and Fox News have chosen to prostitute themselves for Trump, I do see one glimmer of hope hiding in plain sight.
As The Times reported Saturday, incumbent presidents almost always benefit from a strong economy, and right now job growth is robust, and average hourly earnings are up — but Trump’s poll numbers are not: “Instead of enjoying anything close to overwhelming popularity because of the economy, Trump’s national approval rating has remained low, dropping about 2 percentage points to 41% since the Ukraine story broke.’’
“Stock Markets Up Record Numbers,” Trump tweeted Friday, adding, “It’s the economy, stupid.”
Yes, it’s the economy, stupid — when you have a president who is not violating his oath to preserve and protect the Constitution. But if you read today’s poll numbers alongside the economy numbers, it turns out that more than a few Americans are saying, “It’s the Constitution, stupid — and unlike you, Mr. Trump, we value some things more than money.”
We care about having a president who does not lie 20 times a day. We care about having a president who does not demean his opponents and mock their physical appearance. We care about having a president who does not take the word of Russia’s president over that of his own intelligence services. We care about having a president who is not caught up in conspiracy theories, which he then makes everyone around him chase. We care about having a president who values our nonpartisan public servants. We care about having a president who wants to be the president of the whole country, not just his base.
And most of all, we care about having a president who takes seriously his oath to preserve and protect our Constitution. Without that, we will end up one day morally and financially bankrupt. How many Americans will still feel that way on Election Day remains to be seen and will also depend on the Democrats’ alternative. But for now, it’s good to know that it’s a significant number — that despite three years of Donald Trump’s presidency, the country still has a civic pulse.

Nicholas Kristof: The four secrets of success

Texto completo: Whenever I visit a university, students ask for Big Advice. I protest that I don’t have great secrets for life and that my own path has been serendipitous, but they suspect me of holding out.
So as we approach the holidays — a time for reflection and New Year’s resolutions — let me reveal everything. I hereby share with young people the Four Secrets of Success:
1. Take a class in economics and in statistics. I majored in political science and later studied law, but in retrospect I would have focused on economics. Likewise, if you have to choose, skip calculus and focus on statistics.
Education isn’t about filling a bucket but about gaining a tool belt — and economics and statistics offer terrific tools that for the rest of your life will help you analyze problems in more rigorous ways. I champion the humanities for the wisdom they offer, but I do believe that philosophers and playwrights should have present value and standard deviations in their citizen tool belts.
We might also have sounder policy if our leaders weren’t economic illiterates. President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans sold the 2017 tax cut on the absurd notion that it would pay for itself (instead, we’re now running a $1 trillion deficit). And it’s not just Republicans: Democrats have been embracing rent control, even though basic economics show that typical rent-control schemes make housing shortages worse by increasing demand without increasing supply.
2. Connect to a cause larger than yourself. The worst advice people give students is to spend the first third of their lives studying, the middle third making money, and the final third giving back. That would rob you for two-thirds of your life of meaning and fulfillment.
If you dropped dead of a heart attack at 50, you’d be gnashing your teeth for all eternity.
So find some cause that gives you a sense of purpose, ideally by actually connecting you to those less fortunate. This will also lend perspective when a mean professor gives you a bad grade.
3. Make out . The most important decision you will make is not the university you attend, nor your major, not even your first job. It’s whom you marry or settle down with.
The right partner provides crucial emotional support, is likely to parent your children and comforts you when life inevitably goes wrong. A key to a successful career is a great partner. Learning to manage a relationship may take practice, so get started and cuddle!
4. Escape your comfort zone. Your world will be much more globalized than ours, so your education is a failure if it exposes you only to people like yourself and doesn’t prepare you to engage with other cultures.
A quick quiz question: If someone who speaks two languages is bilingual, and someone who speaks three languages is trilingual, what do you call someone who speaks no foreign language at all? Answer: An American.
So take a semester abroad. It’s ridiculous to study Spanish in a classroom when you can absorb so much more in Mexico, Bolivia or Peru. (Items 3 and 4 can be combined for maximum language acquisition.)
I sometimes subject young linguists to a three-question test: In a given language, how do you say: A) doorknob, B) clothes hanger, and C) electrical outlet? The students who ace this test are those who have actually lived abroad.
So resist the temptation to join a herd of other American students in Australia, Britain or even Italy. Try Colombia or China, Senegal or Oman, India or Ghana.
Study abroad can be expensive, so consider work and volunteer opportunities at omprakash.org and idealist.org. They also offer ideas for a gap year between high school and college, as does GlobalCitizenYear.org.
You can also enter a different world right here in the United States by volunteering in a prison or tutoring disadvantaged children in your own town. Or if you’re a coastal elite, perhaps find a temporary job in Trump country, and if you’re already happily in Trump country, find work where progressives predominate. The important thing is to encounter different cultures.
All this leads to an announcement: It’s time for my annual win-a-trip contest. In 2020, as in previous years, I’ll be choosing a university student (undergraduate or graduate) to travel with me on an expense-paid reporting trip to cover global poverty, health and other issues. The winner will write for The New York Times.
I’m not sure where we’ll go. Zimbabwe and the Democratic Republic of Congo are each possibilities, as is Bangladesh. It’s also possible we’ll stay here in the United States and explore the domestic side of global poverty. You can find out more at nytimes.com/winatrip, and thanks in advance to the Center for Global Development for helping me pick a winner.
Apply soon. But if I’m not smart enough to choose you, then maybe you can escape your comfort zone on your own, either abroad or here in the United States. If you don’t win my trip, win your own.

Texto completo: Miguel Jason Rodríguez (39), trabajador emigrante de Ecuador, fue identificado como uno de los seis muertos ayer en un balacera en un supermercado judío en Jersey City.
En el lugar funciona el negocio “Jersey City Kosher Supermarket”, el único negocio kosher en la zona, informó The Fayetteville Observer.
También murieron la dueña del local, Leah Minda Ferencz (33), y su primo Moshe Hirsch Deutsh (24), miembros de la comunidad judía ortodoxa; el detective Joseph Seals (40), considerado un héroe local; y los atacantes, el hombre David Anderson (47) y la mujer Francine Graham (50), que se cree están vinculados al grupo religioso “Israelitas Negros” (Black Hebrew Israelites), según The New York Times.
Desde anoche, el alcalde de Jersey City, Steven Fulop confirmó que los dos atacantes armados que provocaron el caos en Greenville, un barrio residencial, “apuntaron” a una tienda judía cuando intercambiaron disparos con la policía en un tiroteo de una hora.
Fulop, quien es judío, dijo que las autoridades llegaron a esa conclusión sobre la base de la investigación en curso, “después de una extensa revisión de nuestro sistema de circuito cerrado de televisión”.
Williams Machazek, pastor de la Iglesia “Nueva Vida” en Newark, identificó a como víctima Rodríguez, un miembro de su templo que emigró de Ecuador hace tres años.
Rodríguez, dijo Machazek, había estado trabajando en la tienda de comestibles en Jersey City durante más de un año para mantener a su familia, que incluye una esposa y una hija de 11 años.
Moshe Hirsch Deutch estaba de visita desde Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Desde NYC, el alcalde Bill de Blasio condenó el ataque y criticó el antisemitismo en varios mensajes en Twitter después de la declaración de Fulop.
“Esto confirma trágicamente que un patrón creciente de antisemitismo violento se ha convertido en una crisis para nuestra nación. Y ahora esta amenaza ha llegado a las puertas de la ciudad de Nueva York”, escribió De Blasio.
En declaraciones a NBC News agregó que el ataque “fue claramente un crimen de odio”, y que NYPD está “en alerta alta”.

La extraña aparición de palomas con sombreros por las calles de Las Vegas

Texto completo: Durante varios días, se han visto palomas multicolores con sombrero de vaquero pavoneándose en las calles de Las Vegas. Nadie sabe quién equipa a los pájaros, según publica The Washington Post.
El residente de Las Vegas, Bobby Lee, subió a Facebook un video de dos pájaros con sombreros en miniatura, uno rojo y otro rosado, la semana pasada en Facebook . Los “pájaros tienen sombreros, hermano”, exclama en el clip. La publicación, que se compartió ampliamente, rápidamente se hizo viral en Internet y llegó a Mariah Hillman, cofundadora de un rescate local de palomas llamado Lofty Hopes.
Hillman, de 47 años, y la búsqueda de las aves de su hija de 30 años despegaron rápidamente. Comenzaron investigando áreas conocidas, donde repartieron tarjetas de visita y les dijeron a los transeúntes: “Si las ves, aliméntalas. Estamos a solo tres millas de distancia y podemos llegar bastante rápido “.
I finally found one!!! @LasVegasLocally pic.twitter.com/j2u90R2esL
— ???????? ♥????‍♀️ (@kassandraqueenn) December 9, 2019
Desde entonces, Hillman le dijo a The Washington Post, el dúo recibió dos pistas cada día de personas que vieron las palomas, a menudo adjuntando pruebas de video.
Hillman estaba en casa, limpiando jaulas de pájaros, cuando se enteró por primera vez de un avistamiento. Era demasiado tarde para ir a verlo, pero a la mañana siguiente, tan pronto como Hillman entró en la urbanización cerrada, vio la paloma con sombrero rojo, encaramada a la derecha. Ella desaceleró su auto y dijo: “Hola compañero”.
“Estaba sacudiendo la cabeza, tratando de quitarse el sombrero. Definitivamente es pegamento “, le dijo a The Post sobre el adhesivo utilizado en el pájaro. “Tenemos que mudarlo, lo que llevará tiempo”.
Hillman continuó: “Lo único que no los dañaría es el petróleo, que luego lo convierte en una paloma grasa, como los que están alrededor de McDonalds”.
De cualquier manera, la paloma debe quedarse con Hillman por un tiempo. Durante la persecución de dos horas, la exactivista por los derechos de los animales vio un halcón que rodeaba el área, al que llamó “preocupado”.
El misterio permanece
Aunque la gente ha especulado que los sombreros se originaron con un asistente del Rodeo de las Finales Nacionales, que actualmente se lleva a cabo en la ciudad, la asociación ha negado su participación, según The New York Times, y el Departamento de Policía Metropolitana de Las Vegas dijo que “no parece ser un asunto policial “.
Por ahora, Hillman se centra en localizar a las aves y garantizar su seguridad. Hasta ahora, ella y su hija acogieron a Cluck Norris, que luce un sombrero rojo de vaquero, y Coo-lamity James, que usa uno rosa. Otros avistadores mencionaron pájaros con gorras grises y marrones, aunque Hillman aún no los ha encontrado.
El New York Times entrevistó a un ornitólogo de la Universidad de Cornell, Charles Walcott, que se especializa en palomas. “Disfruté el video”, dijo Walcott al Times. “Solo pensé que esas palomas con sombreros eran lindas”.
Walcott también dijo que no está preocupado por las palomas, que actúan con bastante normalidad y no parecen estar angustiados. Los sombreros son “ciertamente lo suficientemente ligeros”, dijo al Times. “A mí me parecen palomas felices. Es difícil saberlo, por supuesto, porque no nos hablarán”.
Las palomas, dijo Hillman, tienen mucho para ellos: se aparean de por vida, los machos y las hembras producen leche y alimentan a sus crías, pueden vivir hasta 20 años en una unidad familiar, y son una de las diez especies que pueden reconocerse en un espejo.
“Son una gran primera mascota”, agregó, y señaló que tienen picos flexibles y no agudos. “Cuando necesitábamos palomas durante la guerra, eran considerados héroes. Ahora que no los necesitamos, se han convertido en alimañas o plagas. Hacemos eso con muchas cosas en esta sociedad, y eso no está bien”. (Editado por Pelayo Escandón)

Anne Hathaway on 'heartbreaking' eco-drama 'Dark Waters'

Texto completo: Anne Hathaway didn't have to dig deep for her latest role in "Dark Waters."
In Todd Haynes' whistleblower drama, the Oscar winner plays the real-life Sarah Bilott, whose husband, lawyer Rob Bilott (Mark Ruffalo), helped expose decades of environmental contamination by chemical company DuPont.
"It's heartbreaking and infuriating on a human level," Hathaway says. "There wasn't really any acting required, in terms of playing someone who was learning of (corruption) and was equal parts aghast and terrified and angry and emotional."
Based on a 2016 New York Times Magazine article by Nathaniel Rich, "Dark Waters" begins with Rob taking on a new client: a West Virginia farmer (Bill Camp) who believes his cows' mysterious deaths are caused by a toxic runoff from a DuPont landfill, which contaminated a creek on his land.
Rob's work eventually leads to a study that finds roughly 70,000 people were drinking tainted water with traces of PFOA, a toxic chemical used in the production of Teflon products such as non-stick pans until 2013. DuPont was allegedly aware for years that PFOA exposure is linked to illnesses such as kidney cancer and thyroid disease, and the company was forced to pay out $671 million in personal injury lawsuits in 2017.
The story hit close to home for Hathaway, 37, already a mom to son Jonathan, 3, with husband Adam Shulman, and now "a thousand months pregnant" with a second child, she says good-naturedly by phone.
After reading the script, "I opened the drawer where I keep my pans and pots, and there was a non-stick pan," Hathaway says. "And despite reading an article when I was pregnant with my first child that said 'don't use non-stick,' there was one that had somehow slipped through the cracks and I'd been feeding my family with it for years.
"I try not to blame myself too hard in those circumstances, because I believe that we as human beings and as Americans should never be put in that position where we're just trying to do our best, and we're inadvertently poisoning ourselves and the people we love."
Hathaway has always had an activist spirit, which is part of the reason why Haynes thought of her to play Sarah.
"Anne has this incredible vitality and intelligence and compassion, and you see that in her work," says the director, best known for the Oscar-nominated "Carol" and "Far from Heaven." "Sarah is an essential part of the story of Rob and how he was able to do what he did, but also how hard it is on a domestic relationship when somebody takes on the system."
A vocal member of the Time's Up movement against sexual harassment and workplace discrimination, Hathaway credits her activism to her parents, who instilled the importance of equality and inclusivity from an early age.
"I was born in the early '80s, and there were still things I was told I couldn't do because I was a girl," Hathaway says. "I was really lucky I was raised in a household where that sentence was never uttered. It seems strange to me that anybody would try to put me in a box based on the way I was born, when it's so much easier to just accept other people for how they are. So I guess that was my first awareness that the world wasn't a fair place for everyone."
The actress says she is grateful for her "Dark Waters" co-star Ruffalo, who has long spoken out about climate change and fracking. She also feels encouraged by the work of 16-year-old Greta Thunberg and other young environmental activists.
"I'm so inspired by them – their priorities are exactly right," Hathaway says. "They are focused and doing all the things we tell young people to do. So I don't understand people's negative reaction to this generation, except to say they must be very comfortable with the greed innate in the status quo."

Texto completo: A reader says the United States' failure there is due to "muddled thinking." Also: A lack of initiative on gun control; student activism at Beacon High School in New York City.
To the Editor:
"Public Was Duped on Afghan War" (front page, Dec. 10) illustrates in a shocking way what happens when a country acts with ignorance about its intended beneficiary, hubris about its omnipotence, muddled thinking about its strategy and recklessness about the use of its resources. On every count the results of our well-intended actions in Afghanistan have been a failure.
We should keep this lesson well in mind when in the future we seek "monsters to destroy," in the words of John Quincy Adams.
This is a textbook example of how a society destroys itself. Let's hope that our children can forgive us for the way we squandered their inheritance.

What Happened to Gun Control?
To the Editor:
Re "The Justices Should Drop This Case" (editorial, Dec. 4):
Despite clear evidence that gun control works in every advanced democracy, the United States repeatedly seems to ignore this and aims to decrease the number of gun laws. This lack of initiative to change gun control laws shows how the current administration values capitalism over safety in its effort to make America great again.
An estimated three million American children are exposed to school shootings every year. According to the nonprofit Gun Violence Archive, there have been 393 mass shootings in the United States this year, which shockingly exceeds the number of days in a year.
Having more guns in any city only increases the threat to public safety. Self-defense can be achieved in many ways other than with guns, and Congress should make all decisions with this in mind.

Diversity in New York City Public Schools
To the Editor:
Re "Beacon High School Is Half White. That's Why Students Walked Out" (news article, Dec. 3):
I commend the students at Beacon High School for trying to raise awareness of the shameful fact that the New York City public school system continues to be highly segregated more than 65 years after the Brown v. Board of Education decision by the Supreme Court.
I find it even more impressive that they are trying to change a system that works in their favor. It seems that the most important social movements are often the creation of young people, who are more aware of, and sensitive to, injustice of all types.
As we age, people tend to rationalize unfairness, or become comfortable with the status quo. To the students at Beacon and to all the students who are involved in the Teens Take Charge movement, I say thank you and keep shouting until you get the change you are demanding.

To the Editor:
Behind the veil of progressivism lies a tendency to want to revert to a simple past. In the case of the New York City public schools, the fact that graduation rates and test scores have risen because of the competitive nature of the system is irrelevant to young activists, irate that a top New York City school does not better reflect the city's demographics.
But these same activists look away when charter schools are mentioned as an alternative to failing inner-city public schools, their goal seemingly an education system where everyone gets an equal amount of nothing. How very progressive.

Texto completo: Two Sydney restaurants, and one in Singapore, are using flames and Australian ingredients in ways that feel exciting and new.
"Is that part of the counter supposed to be on fire?" I asked the bartender, and pointed at the open kitchen of Firedoor, in Sydney, Australia. There is so much open flame on display at this restaurant, it was a little hard to tell if the small, bright flicker on one of the stainless steel counters was intentional or not.
It was not, and was quickly extinguished, but it's hard to think of another restaurant where fire is so integral to the operation that a misplaced mini-inferno would go completely unnoticed. This is the brave new world of Australian barbecue.
"Australian barbecue" is not, however, what Lennox Hastie, the chef at Firedoor, would use to describe his own cooking. Nor is it a term that's been used much by anyone to describe any type of cooking. Here, the word "barbecue" is generally synonymous with the American term "cookout," and, much like the cookout, it remains an integral part of Australia's national identity.
Barbecues are events where sausage-heavy cooking is done on barbies in backyards and public parks, and in hardware store parking lots and out front of polling places on Election Day.
In recent years, American-style barbecue has become an omnipresent trend in Australia, with mixed results. I admit that I identify as an incorrigible barbecue snob, having lived for many years in North Carolina. I never really liked or understood Texas barbecue until I made the pilgrimage to eat it in Texas, an experience that convinced me that some foods simply do not translate well to other locations.
And apart from some truly unforgivable barbecue faux pas (oceans of mayonnaise, lashings of sugary sauce), Australian barbecue purveyors tend to fall victim to the same misstep that plagues many American vendors outside the South: aiming to make all of the styles with all of the meats from all of the regions. The best barbecue restaurants in America tend to specialize in one style of cooking and a few types of meat, rather than trying to cram ribs and brisket and chicken and pulled pork and seven kinds of sauce onto one menu.
But what if there was a style of Australian barbecue that was its very own thing? Influenced, perhaps, by Southern American barbecue, but more heavily by the Basque region of Spain? I believe that such a style is beginning to emerge, and that it's far more exciting than the glut of American-themed barbecue in Sydney, Melbourne and beyond.
Firedoor, which opened in 2015, is a prime example. The kitchen is powered entirely by wood -- there are no electric or gas ovens, burners or microwaves. Mr. Hastie came to this style after working five years at Asador Etxebarri in the Basque Country, where the chef Victor Arguinzoniz cooks local ingredients over fire using multiple types of wood. Mr. Hastie takes a similar approach, but with pointedly Australian ingredients.
One of the restaurant's most thrilling dishes is a whole marron -- a large freshwater crayfish native to Western Australia. The marron is grilled, split open and smothered in sea blite, a coastal plant related to samphire, and sunrise lime, a hybrid citrus created by crossing the native Australian finger lime with a calamondin (itself a cross between a mandarin and a kumquat). There are plenty of smoky, charred meats on the menu as well: pork chops, duck hearts and Wagyu all get their turn on one of the many grills.
Mr. Hastie is not the only Australian chef who spent time at Etxebarri and then translated that experience in his own way, using Australian ingredients. In fact, one of the best examples of new Australian barbecue is, surprisingly, in Singapore.
The chef Dave Pynt, originally from Perth, opened his restaurant Burnt Ends in Singapore in 2013. It is centered on a large wood oven that Mr. Pynt built himself, inspired by his time at Etxebarri. As at Firedoor, all of the cooking here is done using some kind of open flame, and the kitchen, which stretches along the restaurant behind a long wavy counter where most customers sit, holds an impressive number of fire-spitting cooking contraptions.
Though Burnt Ends' own marketing used to refer to the restaurant as "Australian barbecue," Mr. Pynt denies that he ever thought of his food that way, and said that he never applied the term to himself. "We're more of a modern barbecue restaurant," Mr. Pynt said by phone from Singapore.
Regardless, when I ate at Burnt Ends in May, it felt very Australian -- Mr. Pynt uses Australia's Blackmore beef and Western Plains pork, and there's a Pavlova on the dessert menu. Smoke is integral to this cooking, permeating everything from the fennel served with orange and burrata to a smoked ice cream served with chocolate fondant.
Much of the food, particularly the charred vegetable dishes, reminded me of food I'd eaten at Ester, which opened in Sydney in 2013. Another adherent to the wood-fired school of cooking, the chef Mat Lindsay puts as much smoky love into cabbage or cauliflower as he does his steaks and whole fish.
What makes these places worthy of the title "barbecue"? What makes them different from the many modern American restaurants that worship at the altar of the open flame? I think the distinction is in the blending of traditions, and the small and large nods to both American barbecue and the Australian tradition of barbecuing in its original backyard grilling context.
Burnt Ends has a smoky pulled-pork "sanga," referencing both American pork barbecue but using the colloquial Australian term for "sandwich." Ester has a sanga of its own, made with blood sausage -- a modern spin on the sausages usually cooked on Australian barbecues. And as much as I hate to bring up the cliché, it's hard to ignore that Firedoor's charred juicy marron could be seen as the logical successor of, yes, a shrimp on the barbie. An argument begins to take shape that we should consider these chefs pioneers in a divergent new branch of barbecue, one that is distinctively Australian.
This is the conclusion I came to during a Twitter exchange with the barbecue editor of Texas Monthly, Daniel Vaughn, who had requested barbecue recommendations for a research trip to Australia. I (correctly) assumed he was looking for American-style barbecue and was baffled as to why anyone would leave Texas, of all places, and take the grueling flight to Sydney in order to search out brisket and ribs. I said as much, and warned him about all the mayonnaise he was about to encounter.
Go to Firedoor, I told him. Go to Ester. Hell, go to Singapore and cram into the long undulating bar at Burnt Ends. Come away smelling of smoke and meat, and with an excitement about an emerging style of cooking that you cannot find in Texas. Some things are worthy of pilgrimage.

Lori Loughlin spends holidays prepping for next big role: Testifying at her own trial

Texto completo: When her daughters, Olivia Jade and Isabella, were younger, Lori Loughlin and her husband Mossimo Giannulli loved to give them a white Christmas by packing the family up and flying — presumably by private jet — to Colorado so they could all play in the snow and ski.
More recently, though, the Giannulli family has stayed in Los Angeles in their Bel Air mansion, as the former Hallmark Channel star told Parade magazine in 2017. But Loughlin said they still enjoyed other holiday traditions: picking out a tree and decorating it. She said she and her fashion-savvy, social media influencer daughters also loved to go shopping.
“It’s really about getting together with family,” Loughlin said.
This year, the former “Full House” star and her family again will be in Los Angeles, but things will be far less jolly. That’s because Loughlin, 55, is facing the possibility of years in prison for her alleged role in the college admissions scandal and has been hunkering down in rooms with lawyers to prepare her defense, Us Weekly is reporting in its new issue.
The actress best known as wholesome Aunt Becky is participating in “grueling” mock trials, essentially rehearsals for what could be the biggest, most consequential performance of her life: defending herself in federal court against bribery, fraud and money laundering charges.
According to Us Weekly, Loughlin, 55, is “adamant” that she wants to testify, even though it’s never a requirement for defendants to take the stand and defense attorneys often advise against it.
“Lori has no choice at this point but to take this to trial and hope for an acquittal or a hung jury,” a source told Us Weekly.
Loughlin apparently believes she can convince a jury that she’s a sympathetic figure, another insider said. She and her husband are charged with paying $500,000 in bribes to get Olivia Jade, 20, and Isabella, 21, fraudulently admitted to the University of Southern California.
Perhaps the veteran TV actress and media personality hopes she can use her star power and comfort in the spotlight to present herself as a loving mom who thought she was doing right by her daughters. Loughlin and her fashion designer husband also are expected to argue that they were duped into engaging in a bribery scheme concocted by college admissions consultant William “Rick” Singer.
“She feels they’ll believe that the accusations against her don’t merit criminal prosecution, that she truly thought she was making a legal contribution to charity,” the insider told Us Weekly.
Loughlin and Giannulli reportedly will argue that they believed the money they paid to Singer and to his alleged accomplices at USC were legitimate donations to Singer’s education nonprofit and to the school’s athletic programs.
“Mossimo strongly believes they were victims of a con and did nothing wrong,” an insider previously told Us Weekly.
But as much as Loughlin and Giannulli agree on some issues related to their “united front” defense, they disagree on others. That includes Loughlin’s reported earlier desire to strike a plea deal with prosecutors. Now, Loughlin wants to testify, and her husband doesn’t think it’s a good idea at all, Us Weekly reported.
“Mossimo doesn’t want to testify, but will be forced to if Lori does,” the insider told the outlet.
Another worry for the couple is that Olivia Jade and Isabella may be called as prosecution witnesses to testify against their parents. The indictment alleges that Olivia Jade and Isabella participated in the bribery scheme by posing for photos on rowing machines. The photos were used for fake athletic profiles that Singer and his accomplices created in order to present the sisters to admissions officers as crew team recruits.
The prospect of Olivia Jade and Isabella testifying terrifies Loughlin, Us Weekly reported.
“Lori’s bereft when she talks about the girls being forced to testify at their trial,” the insider said. “She doesn’t understand how it got to this point.”
Legal experts say that the decision to testify is always up to a defendant. Juries are instructed to not hold it against defendants when they don’t take the stand.
“There are so many risks to testifying that every attorney worth his salt thinks long and hard about recommending it,” according to a post on AbovetheLaw.com. “No matter what the prosecutor’s evidence, if a defendant testifies that is what will determine the verdict.”
When a defendant testifies, she loses her right to remain silent. It also shifts the burden of proof, which normally is on the prosecution, the legal site said in its post. After a defendant testifies, juries must now look at two “stories” of the case.
“Whether the prosecution made its case or not, if they don’t like how the defendant came off, either because they don’t believe him or just don’t like him, they’ll generally convict,” the post said.
Defense attorneys may see an advantage to putting certain defendants on the stand, notably professional, educated defendants in white-collar cases who have no prior criminal history, the New York Times said. Attorneys may believe they can adequately prepare these defendants to put their cases in the best light.
“The problem in calling the defendant to testify is the second act: cross-examination,” the New York Times said. “Prosecutors often can hardly contain themselves at the thought of getting a shot at the defendant.”
The prosecutor’s strategy usually involves making the defendant uncomfortable and forcing her to respond to questions she may not want to answer, which puts her credibility on the line, the Times added.
For an attorney to decide whether to put a client on the stand, “it comes down to figuring out how well the defendant can perform on the witness stand, particularly cross-examination, as measured against the strength of the government’s case.”
If it’s a matter of “performing,” Loughlin may have an advantage, since performing in TV and in films has been her livelihood for several decades.
In that sense, Loughlin has begun to treat her trial preparation like a “full-time job,” doing the mock trials, meeting with her lawyers or discussing strategy over email,” Us Weekly reported.
Still, the actress also realizes that this could be her last Christmas at home, if the trial doesn’t go her way. For that reason, Loughlin also is trying to spend as much time with her husband and daughters as possible, Us Weekly said. After all, she also once said, “It’s important to make the effort to see your family around the holidays.”

Paul Krugman: Donald Trump is bad for the Jews

Texto completo: On Saturday, Donald Trump gave a speech to the Israeli American Council in which he asserted that many in his audience were “not nice people at all,” but that “you have to vote for me” because Democrats would raise their taxes.
Was he peddling an anti-Semitic stereotype, portraying Jews as money-grubbing types who care only about their wealth? Of course he was. You might possibly make excuses for his remarks if they were an isolated instance, but in fact Trump has done this sort of thing many times, for example asserting in 2015 that Jews weren’t supporting him because he wasn’t accepting their money and “you want to control your politicians.”
Well, it’s not news that Trump’s bigotry isn’t restricted to blacks and immigrants. What is interesting, however, is that this particular anti-Semitic cliché — that Jews are greedy and that their political behavior is especially driven by their financial interests — is empirically dead wrong. In fact, American Jews are much more liberal than you might expect given their economic situation.
This is, by the way, a distinction they share with some other groups, especially Asian Americans. More on that in a minute.
First, some background. The two major political parties in the U.S. really are very different in their policies toward the rich. President Barack Obama was hardly a radical, but when he left office the average federal tax rate on the top 1% was 5 percentage points higher than it had been under George W. Bush. In 2016, Trump claimed that he wouldn’t do the usual Republican thing and cut taxes on the rich while trying to destroy the safety net. But he was lying.
And despite what right-wing pundits like to claim, high-income Americans are in general much more likely than others to support the Republican Party. In last year’s midterms, 52% of voters with incomes more than $200,000 voted Republican, compared with only 38% of voters with incomes under $50,000. The rightward tilt is especially strong at the very top; although there are a few high-profile liberal billionaires, most of the extremely wealthy are also extremely right-wing.
Given these realities, you might expect American Jews, who are in fact considerably more affluent than the average, to lean right. But they don’t. In fact, only 17% of them voted Republican last year.
In other words, American Jews aren’t the uniquely greedy, self-interested characters anti-Semites imagine them to be. But it would be foolish to make the opposite mistake and imagine that Jews are especially public-spirited; they’re just people, with the same virtues and vices as everyone else. I think it was an Israeli friend who first told me that Judaism, unlike other faiths, has rarely been a religion of oppression — but that the reason was simply lack of opportunity, a diagnosis that recent Israeli governments seem determined to confirm.
An aside: American Jews almost all support Israel, but many don’t support the policies of its prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. But that’s presumably a distinction Trump doesn’t understand, at home or abroad.
Back to the question of what makes U.S. Jews politically different. Much of the answer is historical memory. Most of us, I think, know that whenever bigotry runs free, we’re likely to be among its victims.
The Trump administration is, beyond any reasonable doubt, an anti-democratic, white nationalist regime. And while it is not (yet) explicitly anti-Semitic, many of its allies are: “Jews will not replace us” chanted the “very fine people” carrying torches in Charlottesville, Virginia. You have to be willfully ignorant of the past not to know where all this leads. Indeed, it’s happening already: anti-Semitic incidents have soared (and my hate mail has gotten … interesting.)
Jews aren’t the only people who have figured this out. Many Asian American voters used to support Republicans but the group is now overwhelmingly Democratic. Indian Americans, in particular, are like American Jews: a high-income, high-education group that votes Democratic by large margins, presumably because many of its members also realize where white nationalism will take us.
In all of this, Republicans — not just Trump, but his whole party — are reaping what they sowed. Their strategy for decades has been to win votes from working-class whites, despite an anti-worker agenda, by appealing to racial resentment. Trump has just made that racial appeal cruder and louder. And one has to admit that this strategy has been quite successful.
But it takes, well, chutzpah, a truly striking level of contempt for your audience, to foment hatred-laced identity politics, then turn to members of minority groups and say, in effect, “Ignore the bigotry and look at the taxes you’re saving!”
And some of the audience deserves that contempt. As I said, people are pretty much the same whatever their background. There are wealthy Jews who are sufficiently shortsighted, ignorant or arrogant enough to imagine that they can continue to prosper under a white nationalist government.
But most of my ethnic group, I believe, understands that Trump is bad for the Jews, whatever tax bracket we happen to be in.

Texto completo: Mr. Marron began his Wall Street career as a teenager before leading some of its most powerful firms and becoming a force at the Museum of Modern Art.
Donald B. Marron, a prominent Wall Street financier and philanthropist and a major figure in the New York art world, died on Friday in Manhattan. He was 85.
Catherine Marron, his wife, confirmed the death. She said he had been en route to a colleague's holiday cocktail party and was getting out of a car when he had what appeared to be a heart attack. He lived on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.
Mr. Marron's influence ranged across the disparate worlds of high finance, art and government policy. He led some of Wall Street's most powerful firms, played a shaping role in the expansion of the Museum of Modern Art in New York and delved into policy issues as a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and other organizations.
Early in his career, as president and chief executive, Mr. Marron oversaw the transformation of Mitchell Hutchins from a predominantly retail-oriented outfit into one of Wall Street's premier stock research firms. He sold it to PaineWebber, the investment bank and stock brokerage firm, in 1977.
In 1968, Mr. Marron and the Harvard economist Otto Eckstein founded Data Resources Inc., which became what was said to be the largest nongovernmental source of economic data in the world. Mr. Marron served as chairman until McGraw-Hill purchased the firm for $ 103 million in 1979.
He was named chairman and chief executive of the PaineWebber Group in 1980. During his 20-year tenure there, it grew to become one of the nation's largest full-service securities firms before being acquired by the Union Bank of Switzerland, better known as UBS.
When UBS and PaineWebber merged in 2000, Mr. Marron was named chairman of UBS America, a position he held for several years. He founded Lightyear Capital LLC, a New York-based private equity firm focused on financial services investing, in 2000 and became its chairman.
Mr. Marron became a trustee of the Museum of Modern Art in 1975 and a key figure in the museum's expansion in the early 1980s. He was elected president of the museum's board of trustees in 1985.
He was a passionate art collector who spent considerable time scouring galleries, auction houses and artists' studios. "He's always loved art," Ms. Marron said. "He started collecting Hudson River School paintings when he was young and had no money."
He spent more than three decades compiling a vast collection of postwar art that included paintings, drawings and sculpture by Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, Lucian Freud, Jasper Johns and others. He developed close relationships with some of his favorite artists, among them Brice Marden, Ed Ruscha and Mark Grotjahn.
As a supporter of art in the workplace, Mr. Marron lined the walls of UBS PaineWebber's offices nationwide with works from his collection.
"We all spend probably a third of our lives in our offices," Mr. Marron told The New York Times in 2005. "Therefore, if you can expose us to another aspect of creativity in our time, it's a good thing, particularly in the securities business."
Mr. Marron donated part of the UBS-owned collection -- which was valued at about $ 15 million -- to the Museum of Modern Art, where it was exhibited in 2005.
As the art market exploded in recent years, attracting dabblers and speculators, Mr. Marron remained an old-fashioned collector -- passionate about the art itself, rather than looking to flip it for a profit.
He recently opened his own private gallery in Midtown Manhattan, which he filled with works from his own collection. He had no interest in making it public, however, preferring to enjoy the art on his own or with friends.
Donald Baird Marron was born on July 21, 1934, in Goshen, N.Y., the son of Edward J. Marron, a writer, and Ethel Baird Marron, a homemaker. He grew up in New York City.
Mr. Marron attended public schools and the Baruch School of City College of New York (now Baruch College) but did not graduate. "He was super smart and always had an entrepreneurial spirit," his wife said. "He went to one year of college and then left to create his own business and support his mother, brother and sister."
He later received honorary law degrees from Baruch and Long Island University, according to a biography posted by New York University's Marron Institute of Urban Management, which was established with a large donation from him.
Mr. Marron, who stood 6-foot-6, began his Wall Street career as a teenager, taking a trainee's job for less than $ 50 a week at the New York Trust Company, which later merged with Chemical Bank. At New York Trust, he moved into the investment research department.
As a philanthropist, Mr. Marron was active in government and public policy. In addition to being a trustee of New York University, he was a member of the board of overseers and managers of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and a director of the Partnership for New York City. He was also involved with the Coalition for the Homeless.
Mr. Marron was a member of the President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities, the chairman emeritus of the Center for the Study of the Presidency, a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and a trustee of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, where he helped developed the framework for Social Security and pension reform legislation, according to his New York University biography.
He was a former director of the New York Stock Exchange, governor and vice chairman of the Securities Industry Association and governor of the National Association of Securities Dealers.
Ms. Marron said she met Mr. Marron at a cocktail party at the Museum of Modern Art; they were married in 1985. She later served as chairwoman of the New York Public Library and was a contributing editor at Vogue magazine.
A previous marriage, to Gloria Swope, ended in divorce.
Besides his wife, Mr. Marron is survived by their two children, William and Serena Marron; two children from his first marriage, Jennifer Marron and Donald Jr., an economist who served on the Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush; his sister, Carol Ray; his brother, Kenneth; and four grandchildren.

These Homes for Mentally Ill Adults Have Been Notoriously Mismanaged. Now, One Is a Gruesome Crime Scene.

On the afternoon of Dec. 3, workers at the Oceanview Manor Home for Adults found resident Ann McGrory, 58, lying on the floor, lifeless, with her pants down around her ankles. She had cuts and bruises on her hands, head and face. By her side, seated atop his bed in Room 512, was resident Frank Thompson, 64, her sometimes-boyfriend who had a reputation at the home as a heavy drinker with a short temper. The aides called police. Thompson was brought into custody for questioning later that day and placed under arrest on Wednesday.
He is charged with second-degree attempted murder rather than murder because the medical examiner has not yet determined the cause of death to be a homicide, according to a law enforcement source. McGrory also had serious preexisting medical issues, including brain cancer. The criminal complaint, however, lays out evidence that McGrory was severely beaten. She was found with a bruised, swollen eye, blood on the back of her head, broken fingernails and what appeared to be blood beneath them. Thompson has not yet entered a plea. Brooklyn Defender Services, which is representing him, declined to comment because the case is in such an early phase.
The incident is the latest in a decades-long string of controversy at Oceanview Manor and other adult homes throughout New York City, which are occupied primarily by impoverished adults with mental illness but are gradually taking on seniors in need of assisted living.
In the spring of 2017, a ProPublica reporter spent parts of several weeks at Oceanview, where ill and unkempt residents could be seen eating from garbage cans and using outdoor dumpsters as toilets. They complained among themselves of thievery and predation, as well as failed intervention from state regulators. There were two deaths in a matter of weeks and police responded to several emergency calls there, including one related to a resident who had slashed another. At the time, an attorney for the home denied any stabbing, attributed the deaths to natural causes and said that comparing the current state of the homes to their scandalous history was unfair.
In 2002, a New York Times investigation found that adult home residents had been exploited for profit and received subpar health care. Disability rights advocates sued the state, arguing that mentally ill people had been warehoused in Oceanview and other adult homes in New York City, violating their rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act. After more than a decade of litigation, a federal judge ordered the state to assess and move out residents capable of living independently.
In 2017, lawyers representing the adult home industry sued the state on behalf of a single former resident at Oceanview, who allegedly decided to move into his own apartment under the new state program and then changed his mind, wishing to move back into Oceanview because he missed life there. Rather than allow the man alone to move back, the state agreed to temporarily suspend a rule limiting the number of mentally ill adults who can live in the homes. The state has reinstated that rule.
In spite of its problems, the home, like at least a dozen others, is moving into a state-sanctioned business model to care for the elderly and infirm. ProPublica reported this year that hundreds of mentally ill residents have been certified as assisted living recipients, which allows home operators to bill more for their care.
According to the complaint against Thompson, video surveillance footage at the home shows him and McGrory entering his room together at 2:35 p.m. At 2:50 p.m., McGrory opened and then closed the door to his room, but no one else entered the room. At 3:48 p.m., workers entered the room and later told police that they saw Thompson trying to remove McGrory’s pants. It is unclear whether McGrory was asking for help when she opened the door or what prompted the workers to ultimately enter the room.
McGrory was pronounced dead by Emergency Medical Services at 4:57 p.m.
“We are shocked and saddened by these horrifying allegations and are investigating,” said Jonah Bruno, a spokesman for the New York Department of Health, which oversees the home. He would not say whether the home’s administration had properly reported the incident, which would be part of the department’s investigation.
Asked what McGrory’s fate says about the home’s ability to care for people with such extensive medical and psychiatric needs, Bruno said, “Adult homes are capable of providing varying levels of care based on levels of need and are required under state law and regulation to only accept residents for whom they can provide appropriate care.”
Lisa Vider, the home’s administrator, did not return a phone call for comment on this story. But Jeffrey Sherrin, an attorney who represents Oceanview, said, “The incident is under investigation, and so far as we know, no cause of death has been determined. We are unable to comment, and we must also respect resident privacy.”
Fellow residents say both Thompson and McGrory had recently struggled at the facility.

Texto completo: The holidays are here, and for many parents, it's all about managing their kids' expectations. They think they need to give their kids the biggest presents, the most presents and the coolest presents. But trust me: Little Sally won't be scarred for life if she doesn't get a pony.
It's OK to want the best for your kids — we all do. But you should never put yourself in a financial bind to make their holiday dreams come true. That's not what Christmas is about. While other parents are shelling out hundreds or even thousands of dollars to give their kids the "perfect" Christmas, you can teach your little ones about contentment.
Contentment isn't a money issue, even though it has a huge impact on your child's future. It's a heart issue. Content people may not have the best of everything, but they make the best of everything. Without contentment, people often try to fill the void in their hearts by cramming it full of more and more stuff. As a parent, you've got to prepare your children to defend themselves against this threat.
There's lots of research out there showing children are aware of what they have in comparison to what others have at a super-young age. Marketers fight for their attention early on, and by default, they're fighting for your money.
Make sure your kids know the newness of stuff isn't what funds their happiness or their value. Their worth goes far beyond a robo-unicorn, name-brand clothes or the iPhone 73 that everyone else has.
If you have teens, let them know if they pursue material things they're going to be a hamster on a wheel for the rest of their lives. They'll keep going around and around, always thinking the next thing is the one that will make them happy. But, of course, it won't. They'll just run in circles, wasting all their time and energy, and ultimately going nowhere. What God has in store for them is so much bigger than that.
One last reminder: Contentment isn't about age. It's about maturity. I've met 8-year-olds who get this, and 48-year-olds who don't. Your child can probably tell where your heart is regarding material wants and desires. So, be sure to give yourself a heart-check and show your child what real happiness, joy and contentment look like.
If you or your kids are struggling with contentment this season, I have a whole episode of "The Rachel Cruze Show" with advice on how to have more gratitude over the holidays. Remember, more is caught than taught. When your kids see you acting out of gratitude, it can have a huge impact on how they view things, too!

Democrats Rediscover Constitution

Texto completo: One satisfying feature of the impeachment drama is the outbreak among Democrats of enthusiasm for the Constitution. What a refreshing change from years past, when every time a conservative raised a constitutional point, the liberals would roll their eyes and complain that the right was trying to "weaponize" the national parchment. The left seemed to detest the Constitution and the white male nationalists who wrote it.
This attitude came to a head in 2011, after the Republicans won control of the House and decided to open the 112th Congress by reading the Constitution aloud on the floor. What a fracas broke out. The New York Times called it "a ghastly waste of time." Ezra Klein, now editor at large of Vox, said on TV that the parchment "is confusing because it was written more than 100 years ago."
It was ironic. Liberals, after all, had won some of their greatest causes by wielding the Constitution and its Bill of Rights. School desegregation, free speech, restrictions on public prayer, the right to abortion -- these were among the liberal causes won by wrestling on the bedrock of the American constitution.
Never mind all that. Salon headlined a piece, "Let's stop pretending the Constitution is sacred," and illustrated it with a photo of a protest sign: "I Believe in the Constitution. I'm a 'Right-Wing Extremist.'" The Daily Kos later called the reading the "most boring circus ever."
What a difference a decade makes. Today you can't open your browser without seeing Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her camarilla kvelling about the Constitution. The first thing the House Judiciary Committee did was trot out four law professors to talk about not only the Constitution but -- wait for it -- the Founding Fathers' original intent.
Then Mrs. Pelosi marched up to a podium and instructed the Democratic caucus to go ahead and impeach President Trump. "When crafting the Constitution," she said, "the Founders feared the return of a monarchy in America and, having just fought a war of independence, they specifically feared the prospect of a king-president corrupted by foreign influence." Madison, she said, feared "that a president might betray his trust to foreign powers."
She hauled in that old rascal Gouverneur Morris, the constitutional wordsmith. Morris feared, she said, that a president might be "bribed" to "betray his trust" and emphasized that "the people are the king." She inadvertently likened Mr. Trump to George Washington, who was also accused of kingly airs.
She rattled on about George Mason, who "insisted that a president who procured his appointment in his first instance through improper and corrupt acts might repeat his guilt and return to power" and during the debate over impeachment asked: "Shall any man be above justice?" The speaker actually spoke of Mason, a major slaveholder, as acting "in his great wisdom."
Mr. Trump's wrongdoing, Mrs. Pelosi averred, "strikes at the very heart of our Constitution: a separation of powers, three coequal branches, each a check and balance on the other." She may not have proffered any evidence, but it was nice to hear her quoting the Constitution in Republican terms. The Democrats have come a long way.

Texto completo: While demanding that an opponent, Pete Buttigieg, disclose his McKinsey clients, Ms. Warren provided a fuller explanation of her compensation as a legal consultant.
Senator Elizabeth Warren disclosed a detailed list of compensation she received during 30 years of moonlighting as a legal consultant -- about $ 1.9 million in all -- as she and Mayor Pete Buttigieg continued a back-and-forth demanding transparency in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination.
Ms. Warren released the information abruptly on Sunday night, providing financial details to a list her campaign disclosed in May of more than 50 legal cases she had worked on while a full-time law professor, mostly at the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard.
Virtually all of the cases involved bankruptcy, her area of expertise.
Her disclosure came after escalating demands by Mr. Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., who has taken the lead in some of the presidential polls in Iowa, that she provide financial details of her legal work. Ms. Warren, of Massachusetts, had likewise challenged Mr. Buttigieg to provide details of his work with McKinsey & Company, a global management consulting company.
Mr. Buttigieg has said that the details of his work for the company, where he spent nearly three years beginning in 2007, are covered by a nondisclosure agreement.
While some of Ms. Warren's work has been controversial -- such as her decision to advocate for LTV Steel in a case challenging a requirement that it pay into a fund for coal miners -- the information released on Sunday by Ms. Warren reveals that much of her most lucrative work involved relatively mundane cases that did not make headlines.
For example, she made $ 186,000 on work for Bergner & Co., a Midwestern department store chain that declared bankruptcy in 1991. She earned $ 160,000 as an expert witness for Fuller-Austin Insulation Co. in a case against its insurers in 2003.
In one of the more controversial cases Ms. Warren worked on, advising Dow Chemical in connection with breast-implant litigation involving its subsidiary Dow Corning, she earned about $ 20,000. In another newsworthy case, the Enron bankruptcy, she made about $ 77,000 advising one of the failed energy giant's creditors, Rabobank.
The disclosure reveals that Ms. Warren also performed a considerable amount of free, or pro bono, legal work. She did not take any compensation for representing the Massachusetts environmental lawyer made famous by the book "A Civil Action" or for work in two cases for the AARP.
Her campaign said it could not find records for compensation in five cases.
An analysis of her legal work suggested that she took on some of the cases as an effort to preserve the integrity of the bankruptcy system and, in others, she was merely advocating on behalf of clients.
The disclosure came after accelerating hostilities between Ms. Warren and Mr. Buttigieg. Last month, Ms. Warren responded to needling by Mr. Buttigieg that she account for her private-sector work by saying, "There are some candidates who want to distract from the fact that they have not released the names of their clients."
Tensions between the two candidates seemed to boil over last week, when, speaking at a party fund-raiser in Boston, Ms. Warren called on him not only to reveal his McKinsey clients but also to open up about his private fund-raising.
An adviser to Mr. Buttigieg, Lis Smith, responded on Twitter by suggesting that if Ms. Warren wanted to debate about transparency, she should release more details about her work as a lawyer.

Pelosi has doomed moderate Democrats in Trump districts

Texto completo: With her announcement that Democrats will move forward and vote on articles of impeachment, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., may have signed a political death warrant for dozens of moderate Democrats elected in Trump districts.
Pelosi is speaker today because in 2018 Democrats were able to convince voters in 31 House districts Trump carried two years before to defect and vote for them. Democrats need these voters to stay in their column in 2020 if they are to hold onto the House and win back the White House.
But in key swing states, large majorities of these 2018 defectors now say they plan to back Trump again in 2020. The New York Times reported that "nearly two-thirds of voters in six battleground states who voted for President Trump in 2016 -- but for Democratic congressional candidates in 2018 -- say they intend to back the president against each of his top rivals." The Times also reported that in 2018, voters in these states cast their ballots "for Democratic congressional candidates by an average of six points, all but identical to their actual winning margins." That means these freshman Democrats already face an uphill battle to hold onto their seats.
Now, Pelosi is adding to their woes by forcing them to vote to recommend the removal of a president that voters in their districts say they plan to reelect. Already, she forced them to vote to authorize an impeachment inquiry, and all but two did so. But there is a world of difference between backing an impeachment inquiry and voting to impeach. Before the hearings began, swing-state voters said they supported the impeachment inquiry by a margin of 50% to 45%, but opposed impeaching and removing Trump by 53% to 43%. After weeks of wall-to-wall hearings, polls show that Democrats failed to move the needle in favor of impeachment and removal. Indeed, in Wisconsin, opposition to removal has nearly doubled. In other words, Democrats have failed to make their case.
By moving forward with impeachment anyway, Pelosi is putting her most vulnerable members in a terrible position. Split-ticket voting is already rare. The Washington Post reported in 2016 that that election "saw the highest percentage of STRAIGHT-ticket voters in more than a century." And according to FiveThirtyEight, split-ticket voting hit a new low in 2018. Impeachment makes it even less likely that swing-state voters will split their tickets. Are voters really going cast ballots to give Trump four more years and also to reelect the Democratic House members who tried to take that decision out of their hands by impeaching him?
Voters in these Trump districts are already frustrated with their Democratic representatives. They won on promises to work with the president to address issues like health care, prescription drug prices, infrastructure and trade. None of that is getting done, thanks to Democrats' focus on impeachment. Indeed, there is speculation in the White House that the reason Pelosi has been slow-rolling the U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement Trump negotiated is not out of reluctance to give Trump a win, but because she needs it as leverage with her moderate members to get their votes for impeachment. "She's using USMCA to get the impeachment vote," Trump has said.
Pelosi isn't stupid. She would not have announced a vote on articles of impeachment if she didn't believe she had the votes. But while she can strong-arm the moderates in her caucus, she can't strong-arm the voters in their districts. Her decision to move forward with impeachment means that many of those 31 Democrats seem destined to lose in November. Apparently, that is a price she is willing to pay to placate her party's virulent anti-Trump base.

HER 'HAPPY PLACE'

Texto completo: Soprano Jennifer Rowley won't pick violets. She likes large blooms — in big gardens. Next spring she takes on the murderous villain, Scarpia, and then executes a Vin Diesel exit off the city wall of 18th century Rome as the title star in the Puccini potboiler "Tosca." Those feats are for the Metropolitan Opera in New York City.
Still at the Met, she'll morph into the flirty Musetta of "La Boheme," in love with Marcello, but unable to resist recruiting a male entourage with her well-timed sashay. Both roles are just after Rowley defies two kingdoms for love in the title role of "Aida" in Barcelona. One role owning her mind space now is a June 2020 premiere as Queen Elizabeth, caught in a deadly triangle with the man she loves and the woman he loves, for Donizetti's "Roberto Devereux." Even the building is larger than life – she's performing at Australia's contemporary architectural wonder, the Sydney Opera House.
In between all those roles, and recitals, a girl's got to get some rest. Rowley and her husband, Ray Diaz, did that by moving from frenetic Manhattan to sunny Fort Myers.
"I call it my happy place," she said of the city, which puts her close to Florida family. The Cleveland native, a Baldwin-Wallace Conservatory graduate, and her husband had moved from New York to Detroit, where he could finish his studies, but the return to New York was a shock.
"Everything was so gray. And people were sick all the time. My father lived in Bonita for many years and now lives in Cape Coral, and every time we were down here we were so happy." So they began looking at real estate.
Another thing she waved goodbye to: long commutes to JFK or La Guardia airports. Rowley and Diaz are in a new development just minutes from Southwest Florida International Airport — "Fifteen minutes, if that," she said, beaming — and it's a date-night drive to Miami International Airport for direct flights to her European and Pacific destinations.
The couple moved in this summer, and Rowley had just flown back from starring in the summer festival two days before the interview.
"I walked in the door and said, 'Ahhhh!" she exulted.
Rowley has fair reason for exhaustion from the personae she takes on. But they're, in essence, her tribe. This 21st century star approaches her art with an immersion in their background, their music and their stories.
"I love each of those women for the women that they are. I mean Musetta —she's incredible, and in reading the resource material that the opera comes from, you actually find out how intelligent and how wise and how crafty and how manipulative she is. And you fall in love with her. Tosca is the same."
"These women have these rich histories, and then they become these larger-than-life characters onstage. I've become very attracted to their stories.
"But I'm also very attracted to the music. You know, Verdi's verismo is incredibly beautiful. And Puccini's bel canto — omigosh, I love everything bel canto."
She is described as having "pitch-perfect polish" with "virtuosic breath support" by Opera Wire. Rowley display an "even, radiant tone" with "effortless chiffony top notes," said one New York Times critic.
"It only takes me only about two weeks to learn the notes to the opera," Rowley said of her roles. "That's not the hard part. The hard part is the Italian, to get every word specific, learning how the language is used with that character."
Rowley does not love in a vacuum. By the time she appears in "Roberto Devereux," she will know the lines of every character.
"I have a technique where I use flash cards for every single role. I have a stack of flash cards in my music room," she explained. "I write out the entire score. I write my lines in red pen on index cards. I write everyone else's lines in blue or black or green or pink or whatever.
"Then I flip the next card over and write the translation, so that everything's in English. I know every single line of every person I come in contact with."
Down time means her index cards will come out, and doctor's appointments, subway rides, coffee breaks become her homework rooms. She stores the cards for every role, so she can refresh herself if she's called to play it again.
Rowley flashed an impish smile at the suggestion she might miss the vast New York shopping for concert apparel.
"I do actually a lot of outlet shopping for my gowns because you can find beautiful designer gowns for a fraction of the price," she confided. "Actually the last gown I bought, I got at Miromar Outlets, Nieman-Marcus. Escada - 75 percent off the clearance price," she said, a prospector holding up the gold nugget.
"I just found one at Kelly Chase Couture in Bonita Springs. I picked one absolutely stunning gown. It's very Florida looking, and very peaceful, a nice summery color.
"It looks like the place to me. I like to find things that kind of go with location, time, place time of year, things like that."
"I like to look for things that are comfortable, obviously, but also absolutely beautiful. Nothing too distracting — not like totally beaded, but something that makes the audience say 'Whoa' when you come out."

Democrats Rediscover the Constitution; The impeachment effort has Pelosi and even leftist law professors touting the Founding Fathers' intent.

Texto completo: One satisfying feature of the impeachment drama is the outbreak among Democrats of enthusiasm for the Constitution. What a refreshing change from years past, when every time a conservative raised a constitutional point, the liberals would roll their eyes and complain that the right was trying to "weaponize" the national parchment. The left seemed to detest the Constitution and the white male nationalists who wrote it.
This attitude came to a head in 2011, after the Republicans won control of the House and decided to open the 112th Congress by reading the Constitution aloud on the floor. What a fracas broke out. The New York Times called it "a ghastly waste of time." Ezra Klein, now editor at large of Vox, said on TV that the parchment "is confusing because it was written more than 100 years ago."
It was ironic. Liberals, after all, had won some of their greatest causes by wielding the Constitution and its Bill of Rights. School desegregation, free speech, restrictions on public prayer, the right to abortion—these were among the liberal causes won by wrestling on the bedrock of the American constitution.
Never mind all that. Salon headlined a piece, "Let's stop pretending the Constitution is sacred," and illustrated it with a photo of a protest sign: "I Believe in the Constitution. I'm a 'Right-Wing Extremist.' " The Daily Kos later called the reading the "most boring circus ever."
What a difference a decade makes. Today you can't open your browser without seeing Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her camarilla kvelling about the Constitution. The first thing the House Judiciary Committee did was trot out four law professors to talk about not only the Constitution but—wait for it—the Founding Fathers' original intent.
Then Mrs. Pelosi marched up to a podium and instructed the Democratic caucus to go ahead and impeach President Trump. "When crafting the Constitution," she said, "the Founders feared the return of a monarchy in America and, having just fought a war of independence, they specifically feared the prospect of a king-president corrupted by foreign influence." Madison, she said, feared "that a president might betray his trust to foreign powers."
She hauled in that old rascal Gouverneur Morris, the constitutional wordsmith. Morris feared, she said, that a president might be "bribed" to "betray his trust" and emphasized that "the people are the king." She inadvertently likened Mr. Trump to George Washington, who was also accused of kingly airs.
She rattled on about George Mason, who "insisted that a president who procured his appointment in his first instance through improper and corrupt acts might repeat his guilt and return to power" and during the debate over impeachment asked: "Shall any man be above justice?" The speaker actually spoke of Mason, a major slaveholder, as acting "in his great wisdom."
Mr. Trump's wrongdoing, Mrs. Pelosi averred, "strikes at the very heart of our Constitution: a separation of powers, three coequal branches, each a check and balance on the other." She may not have proffered any evidence, but it was nice to hear her quoting the Constitution in Republican terms. The Democrats have come a long way.

Texto completo: A book published 60 years ago provides an interesting indication of changing American attitudes.
"Advise and Consent," by New York Times reporter Allen Drury, offered an insightful look at the U.S. Senate and won a Pulitzer for fiction. The plot involves a senator who, rather than face exposure of a years-earlier homosexual contact, kills himself.
Today, it's difficult to accept the likelihood that such "shame" would provoke a suicide. The change has been gradual, but steady.
Now young Pete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Ind., is a front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination. In Drury's day there were many terms, mostly derogatory slang, used to describe homosexuals; "gay" was not among them. Has public acceptance of homosexuality in the ensuing three generations undergone a similar degree of change?
Twenty-four years ago, the issue caused some turmoil in Des Moines when the schools' policy on dealing with sexual deviance came under fire. In a crowded meeting hall, school board member Jonathan Wilson took the microphone to confirm the authenticity of rumors that he was gay.
The following year he was up for re-election, after having won four terms. His opponents had the endorsement of all Republican presidential candidates who were in Iowa campaigning for the caucuses.
The 1996 school-board election drew 30,000 voters — five times as many as usual. Wilson won 12,000, but "lost by a landslide," in his words.
The next Iowa storm over the issue came in 2009 with the Iowa Supreme Court's 7-0 ruling on same-sex marriage. The following year, the three justices up for yes-or-no retention were tossed off the court by a 55-percent majority. In the years since, voters have retained other justices involved in the ruling.
Fifteen years ago a national poll conducted by the Pew Research Center showed 31 percent support for gay marriage; this year's poll showed 61 percent approval.
Another poll this year showed 46 percent of Republicans are open to electing a gay president.
Barack Obama proved in 2008 and 2012 that race prejudice, while far from erased, need no longer exclude people of color in national elections; the popular vote in 2016, and the growing number of women in politics, showed a similar decline in gender prejudice. But the issue is far from resolved.
The upcoming Iowa Democratic caucuses will measure the feelings of the current minority political party of one small state. Caucus-goers' opinions regarding Buttigieg's gay status may be a major factor or next-to-no-factor at all.
But the possibilities pose a real concern for Democrats — who may differ as to whether being gay will help or hurt the candidate, but who seem to agree that for the coming 2020 national showdown, picking someone on the basis of his or her chance of winning is far more important than choosing on the basis of any single or any combination of political issues.
There are huge matters to be resolved during the coming presidential term. These include climate change, expanding Medicare, financing higher education, immigration, federal minimum wage, crumbling infrastructure, and more. By comparison, the sexual preference of the chief executive should surely be immaterial.
But "should" and "should not" don't count when the votes are tabulated.
• • •
With painful regularity, we read about the Iowa caucuses "which began in 1972." That's only wrong by a century and a quarter.
The caucuses began with statehood, under a highly different format. Local political leaders, sometimes intent on dictating the choice of state convention delegates with no interference from the voters, decided where and when they would meet depending on how they could best discourage attendance.
Iowa historians have written of instances where the leaders would post a time and place, then meet an hour earlier, finish business in minutes and close down, apologizing for any misunderstanding. In one instance, the leaders set a huge fire in a part of town well away from the caucus site to create a distraction.
Jim Flansburg, the late Register political editor, said that once, a team of leaders, when ordered to post a time and place, wrote notices on paper, went out at midnight and peeled the bark from trees, posted the notices and then replaced the bark to cover them. (Knowing Jim, he just may have made that up.)
• • •
And by the way, outdated or not, "Advise and Consent" is still a helluva read.

Texto completo: Anne Hathaway didn't have to dig deep for her latest role in "Dark Waters."
In Todd Haynes' whistleblower drama, the Oscar winner plays the real-life Sarah Bilott, whose husband, lawyer Rob Bilott (Mark Ruffalo), helped expose decades of environmental contamination by chemical company DuPont.
"It's heartbreaking and infuriating on a human level," Hathaway says. "There wasn't really any acting required, in terms of playing someone who was learning of (corruption) and was equal parts aghast and terrified and angry and emotional."
Based on a 2016 New York Times Magazine article by Nathaniel Rich, "Dark Waters" begins with Rob taking on a new client: a West Virginia farmer (Bill Camp) who believes his cows' mysterious deaths are caused by a toxic runoff from a DuPont landfill, which contaminated a creek on his land.
Rob's work eventually leads to a study that finds roughly 70,000 people were drinking tainted water with traces of PFOA, a toxic chemical used in the production of Teflon products such as non-stick pans until 2013. DuPont was allegedly aware for years that PFOA exposure is linked to illnesses such as kidney cancer and thyroid disease, and the company was forced to pay out $671 million in personal injury lawsuits in 2017.
The story hit close to home for Hathaway, 37, already a mom to son Jonathan, 3, with husband Adam Shulman, and now "a thousand months pregnant" with a second child, she says good-naturedly by phone.
After reading the script, "I opened the drawer where I keep my pans and pots, and there was a non-stick pan," Hathaway says. "And despite reading an article when I was pregnant with my first child that said 'don't use non-stick,' there was one that had somehow slipped through the cracks and I'd been feeding my family with it for years.
"I try not to blame myself too hard in those circumstances, because I believe that we as human beings and as Americans should never be put in that position where we're just trying to do our best, and we're inadvertently poisoning ourselves and the people we love."
Hathaway has always had an activist spirit, which is part of the reason why Haynes thought of her to play Sarah.
"Anne has this incredible vitality and intelligence and compassion, and you see that in her work," says the director, best known for the Oscar-nominated "Carol" and "Far from Heaven." "Sarah is an essential part of the story of Rob and how he was able to do what he did, but also how hard it is on a domestic relationship when somebody takes on the system."
A vocal member of the Time's Up movement against sexual harassment and workplace discrimination, Hathaway credits her activism to her parents, who instilled the importance of equality and inclusivity from an early age.
"I was born in the early '80s, and there were still things I was told I couldn't do because I was a girl," Hathaway says. "I was really lucky I was raised in a household where that sentence was never uttered. It seems strange to me that anybody would try to put me in a box based on the way I was born, when it's so much easier to just accept other people for how they are. So I guess that was my first awareness that the world wasn't a fair place for everyone."
The actress says she is grateful for her "Dark Waters" co-star Ruffalo, who has long spoken out about climate change and fracking. She also feels encouraged by the work of 16-year-old Greta Thunberg and other young environmental activists.
"I'm so inspired by them – their priorities are exactly right," Hathaway says. "They are focused and doing all the things we tell young people to do. So I don't understand people's negative reaction to this generation, except to say they must be very comfortable with the greed innate in the status quo."
After roles in "Serenity" and "The Hustle" earlier this year, Anne Hathaway is back on the big screen this fall with "Dark Waters," pictured, which tackles industrial pollution.

Texto completo: If the Florida Legislature doesn't intend to address the growing number of unvaccinated children attending schools and daycare centers, Tallahassee should at least alert the public to the growing danger they pose.
Most parents get their children vaccinated against communicable diseases that continue to kill millions worldwide. But a vocal minority, mostly concerned about safety, are abusing religious and medical exemptions to send their children to school without the immunizations required by law.
Some "anti-vaxxers" are using noxious tactics to intimidate lawmakers trying to address the public health threat, notably Florida Sen. Lauren Book, D-Plantation, and U.S. Rep. Frederica Wilson, D-Miami Gardens. The tactics have included a noose, a menstrual cup and social media horror.
Unfortunately, the ugliness is working. Book's bill to eliminate the religious exemption and create a review panel to examine questionable trends in medical exemptions won't even get a hearing during the session that begins next month.
Neither can Wilson get traction on her bill to end religious exemptions.
It's election season, after all. Who wants to rattle a fringe group of protestors who show up at legislative meetings, camp outside offices and chain themselves to capital fences shouting "religious freedom?" No major religion forbids vaccinations, by the way.
Meanwhile, vaccination trends are tracking a perilous course in Florida, which faces an increased risk because of our international visitors. The CDC counted Miami-Dade, Broward, Orange and Hillsborough among the Top 25 counties most at risk for a measles outbreak this year.
Overall, Florida's risk is high because more than a third of our 67 counties fail to meet the goal that 95 percent of kindergarten students be vaccinated - the level that creates what public health experts call "herd immunity," protecting even those who can't be vaccinated for legitimate medical reasons.
The Florida Department of Health says vaccination rates improve by seventh grade. At that point, only six counties fail to meet the threshold needed to prevent the spread of viruses like measles, which had been eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, but showed up in 31 states this year, including Florida.
But reporting by the South Florida Sun Sentinel shows the state's statistics are dangerously misleading. For when you look at individual schools, the picture looks far different.
Barely half - 53 percent - of Broward County's traditional public schools and charter schools with kindergartners hit the 95 percent threshold.
Palm Beach County did even worse. Only 46 percent of public and charter schools reached the protection threshold.
In Miami-Dade, it was just 36 percent.
As for private schools, those in Broward, Palm Beach and Miami-Dade all had rates below 80 percent.
Even these numbers can't be trusted, experts say, because the data collection system is so haphazard.
"I understand how the (vaccination) data is captured," said Dr. Lisa Gwynn, an associate professor at the University of Miami School of Medicine. She runs a pediatric mobile health unit that visits Miami-Dade schools out of vaccine compliance.
"It's not good."
Florida SHOTS is the state health department's vaccination registry, though doctors haven't been required to use it. Often, they've simply given parents a signed immunization form. A child entering kindergarten presents that form. The school's registrar enters the information by hand into a database. That record goes to the Florida Department of Education, which reports it to the Department of Health. All 67 school districts have their own systems, some antiquated, Gwynn said.
It's easy to see how the system could miss children or give a false sense of security. Last year, the Legislature passed a law requiring doctors to use the registry by 2021, though parents can opt their children out.
Religious exemptions are a big reason why vaccination rates are falling. Between 2011 and 2018, such exemptions jumped from about 6,500 students to almost 25,000 - an increase of about 375 percent, a Tampa Bay Times review found.
This year, nearly three percent of kindergartners obtained religious exemptions. That's a record. So is the 1.7 percent of seventh-graders unvaccinated because of a parent's religious objection.
Yet no major religion objects to vaccination. That includes Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, Seventh Day Adventist, Jehovah's Witness and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.
Only two religions - Christian Scientists and the Dutch Reformed Church - "might" have a negative stance toward vaccines, wrote John Grabenstein, global director of medical affairs for Merck Vaccines, in a 2013 article for the journal Vaccine.
Even that's in dispute. One subset of Dutch Reformed describes vaccinations as "a gift from God," he wrote. And Mary Baker Eddy, founder of the Christian Scientist faith, said in a 1901 interview: "Rather than quarrel with vaccination, I recommend, if the law demand, that an individual submit to this process, that he obey the law, and then appeal to the gospel to save him from bad results."
Sen. Book is right to focus on medical exemptions, too.
Consider what happened after California banned religious exemptions following a measles outbreak at Disneyland in 2015. Anti-vaxxers began securing medical exemptions from physicians identified as "vaccine flexible" on social media.
Since then, medical exemptions have quadrupled in California. According to news reports, some doctors signed as many as 50 waivers for a single community. They remind us of the doctors who once ran Florida's notorious pill mills and ignited the nation's opioid epidemic. Tallahassee long ignored them, too.
Mary Beth Michael, founder of an anti-vaccine organization, said parents "just want to hold onto their freedom." But the law doesn't force parents to vaccinate their children. They are free to homeschool them.
Neither, though, does the law give people the right to risk the safety of an entire community. Recall how Santeria followers once sacrificed goats and chickens outside Miami's Metro Justice Building, believing the religious ritual would sway judicial outcomes. The practice was prohibited because blood-borne pathogens threatened public health.
Actually, it is a minority of parents that traffics in junk science that endangers the vast majority. Public service campaigns can do only so much against people who claim that vaccines cause autism, a rumor that's long been debunked.
As for those who say vaccines contain the cells of aborted fetuses, vaccines are highly purified, though may contain traces of DNA from the human or animal cells they were grown in, the New York Times reports.
"Vaccines against viral diseases are made from viruses ... and can multiply only when grown in broths of live cells," the Times reports. "The cells must be free of cancer and viruses, which is one reason the ancestor cells (harvested decades ago) come from fetuses that have never been exposed to pathogens - fetuses that were removed in sterile surgical environments, not from miscarriages."
Nonetheless, "religious authorities have meticulously studied how vaccines are made and what is in them, and still have ruled that they do not violate Jewish, Islamic or Catholic law," the paper reports.
Indeed, vaccines are endorsed by top Jewish and Islamic scholars, and by the Vatican.
"Far more than simply encouraging vaccination," said Rabbi David Shabtai of Boca Raton, Jewish leaders "are saying this is a religious mandate. Of course you have to do it. You have to take care of your health."
Nothing in life is risk-free, but vaccines have been proven to prevent deadly diseases.
Every leading medical association calls for strong vaccine requirements and an end to non-medical exemptions. They include the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Medical Association and six more.
Florida should listen to the medical and religious experts, and allow vaccination exemptions only in rare and justified instances.
If the Legislature doesn't have the courage to do so, it should fund a campaign to alert the public to the threat growing among us.
Fight a campaign of lies with a campaign of truth.

Texto completo: Anthony Cotsifas is a native New Yorker who became a professional photographer in 1991. He photographed the colorful gem jewelry in this issue (Romancing the Stone, Page 89); the shoot was inspired by Christo and Jeanne-Claude's "Wrapped Book (Modern Art)" (1978).
Haidee Findlay-Levin is a New York-based, South African-born stylist. She styled the multicolored jewelry story (Romancing the Stone, Page 89).
Fabrice Fouillet is a Paris-based photographer. For this issue, he shot a house designed by Studio Peregalli (Historical Fiction, Page 130) near St. Moritz, Switzerland.
Zoë Lescaze is a writer based in New York. She profiled the conceptual artist Andrea Fraser (With Friends Like These ..., Page 124). Her book, "Paleoart: Visions of the Prehistoric Past," was published by Taschen in 2017.
Collier Schorr is a New York-based photographer whose work is in the collections of many museums, including the Museum of Modern Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art. She shot this issue's fashion story (Who's That Girl?, Page 116) and is a member of the faculty of the Yale School of Art.
Nadia Vellam, T's photo and video director, oversaw the shoots for this issue's cover story (THE REVISIONISTS, Page 106) and the feature about Andrea Fraser (With Friends Like These ..., Page 124), among others. For a number of years, Jesse Green, the co-chief theater critic for The New York Times, who wrote this issue's story "The Revisionists" (Page 106), has been predicting what he calls "the end of the gay play"
-- or at least a winding-down of a certain kind of theater written mostly by white upper-middle-class playwrights. "We had moved from powerful dramas of prejudice and coming out, to stories about H.I.V. and AIDS," he says, to plays about domesticity and parenting, dealing with issues of "how we get along with our increased privilege." At the same time, he had noticed a wave of productions -- for example, Paula Vogel's "Indecent" (2015) and Taylor Mac's "A 24-Decade History of Popular Music" (2016) -- that drew on the past to explain how we reached our current moment. That phenomenon became the starting point for his story, but he also looked beyond theater to the work of queer authors, visual artists and filmmakers who compel their audiences to look at history in new ways (among his favorites: the British novelist Sarah Waters and the American artists Glenn Ligon and Debbie Grossman). "I think there's a certain form of queer art, in its relationship with the past," Green says, "that is going to open us up to the future instead of closing us down."
To illustrate the story, the Los Angeles-based cinematographer James Hawkinson photographed a cast of queer models at Blairsden, a Gilded Age mansion in New Jersey, in tableaus that evoke Renaissance paintings. In addition to 16th-century artworks, such as "Gabrielle d'Estrées and One of Her Sisters," painted by an anonymous artist in the 1590s, he looked to the 20th-century Belgian Surrealist Paul Delvaux, whose sense of mystery and melancholia he hoped to conjure in his own images, and to the contemporary American artist John Currin, who makes luminous satirical portraits using Dutch-master techniques. "We didn't want this to be a costume drama," says Hawkinson, who was most recently a director of photography for the Amazon Prime series "The Man in the High Castle" and is now working on "Barkskins," a TV adaptation of the novel by Annie Proulx. "We wanted to bring a modern feel." To that end, the New York-based stylist Jay Massacret chose garments that featured both contemporary fabrics and historical details. "If there was draping," he says, "it was on a sweatshirt." An additional challenge, he notes, was shooting the models in front of a banquet table heaped with perishable food, including an octopus and a giant king crab. "We had a limited amount of time," he says, "but thankfully everything was consumed afterward." -- Alice Newell-Hanson

Texto completo: The New York Times's chief classical music critic and a loyal reader (and listener) wrestle with the boundaries of programming.
After Anthony Tommasini faulted the conductor Philippe Jordan in a review for leading a program of repertory staples -- including Beethoven's Seventh Symphony -- with the New York Philharmonic in late October, a reader wrote Mr. Tommasini an email with his vehement disagreement. It led to a lively exchange between the two about what classical music audiences really want. The following correspondence has been edited and condensed.
A READER WRITES:
You take a swipe at Mr. Jordan for "playing it safe." I am a subscriber to the Philharmonic and I have listened, usually painfully, to cutting edge or obscure compositions that you wish he had added to the program. As you are a critic, you view and listen to performances through a very different lens than those who want to be soothed and enthralled after a long day of tedium. The last thing I want is Philip Glass, obscure Swiss music, or anything that doesn't sparkle like crystal. I avoid the type of music that you try promote and while this is indeed a "safe" program, I have been looking forward to the evening for weeks. -- RANDEL COLE
A CRITIC RESPONDS:
I appreciate hearing from readers, especially those who love music as much as you clearly do. But I do think it's a problem for classical music when major conductors like Mr. Jordan play it "safe."
It's certainly true that as a critic, I may have approached this program with a "different lens," as you put it. But when you state that you want to be "soothed and enthralled" after a long day of tedium, I have to say that Beethoven would be perturbed by the idea that anyone would find his Seventh Symphony soothing, or even enthralling. He had something greater and more disruptive in mind. Beethoven was writing the "cutting edge," to use your term, works of his day -- pushing boundaries, trying to shake up listeners and devise entirely new ways to conceive a symphony. You might be amazed to see the number of uncomprehending reviews his symphonies received when they were new. One London critic, 12 years after the premiere of the Seventh Symphony, could still not "discover any design in it" and concluded that the piece might be some kind of "hoax."
I prefer performances of Beethoven's Seventh Symphony that somehow convey to listeners how extreme, how radical the piece was when new and in many ways remains. The best way to make that case, without resorting to any kind of manipulated interpretation, is to perform it alongside contemporary works so that the old and new music can engage in a back and forth. This is the approach taken in countless museum exhibitions. Why can't classical concerts emulate this?
Also, if you resist contemporary music, do you also resist contemporary theater, dance, art, novels? I bet not. Why should the field of classical music be singularly called upon to hew to the classics?
Beethoven had to fight constantly the entrenched forces of music, all those promoters and patrons and performers who resisted new, challenging work. If classical music is going to have a future as well as a history then music-lovers and major institutions must foster new work. As a critic, I have a role to play in this effort. -- ANTHONY TOMMASINI
A READER CONCLUDES:
Yes, Beethoven once was indeed radical, and, back in his day, it would have been heresy to refer to his work as "soothing or enthralling." However, 207 years have passed since his Seventh Symphony was completed. Is it not now considered to be mainstream, or am I guilty of elitism? No matter, as I agree with you that "soothing" is not the appropriate adjective to describe the Seventh -- unless you compare it to the new, atonal, discordant compositions that often begin many of the Philharmonic performances.
I appreciated the juxtaposition of new and old that make up the evening performance, but I don't think it's a prerequisite, nor do I consider an evening without it to be pandering. Sometimes it's O.K. to simply listen to the Beatles without comparing them to the Rolling Stones.
As to the new classical music being produced ... it's a matter of taste I suppose, but is not music primarily meant to delight and be embraceable? Sadly, much is either too intellectual, unpleasant to the ear, boring or repetitive -- if I am permitted to generalize.
Good luck, be well, and think of people like me every so often in your reviews, please. -- RANDEL COLE

Texto completo: Catch Minhal Baig's coming-of-age story about a Muslim teenager, and the revival of Showtime's pioneering L.G.B.T.Q. series.
What's Streaming
HALA (2019) Stream on Apple TV Plus. Although it's not autobiographical, the filmmaker Minhal Baig plumbed aspects of her own childhood in Chicago to tell the story of her title character in "Hala." The feature follows the high school senior as she comes to terms with her identity as an American teenager and the daughter of Muslim Pakistani immigrants. "As Hala tests the boundaries of faith and sexual desire (her name means 'halo' in Arabic, and it feels like a burden), the movie is unsparing about gender roles and the awkwardness of first-time fumblings," Jeannette Catsoulis wrote in her New York Times review, designating the film a Critic's Pick.
REPRISAL Stream on Hulu. Abigail Spencer stars in this noir thriller that looks like David Lynch or Quentin Tarantino's take on "Sons of Anarchy." Spencer plays Doris Quinn (a.k.a. Katherine Harlow) who, after being dragged behind the bed of a pickup truck and left for dead by her brother, sets out to take revenge on him and his gang, the Banished Brawlers. The show is produced by Warren Littlefield, who also produced "The Handmaid's Tale" and the anthology series based on "Fargo."
TRUTH BE TOLD Stream on Apple TV Plus. Like the Facebook Watch series "Limetown," this show follows an intrepid true-crime podcaster (played by Octavia Spencer) who digs into an old murder case when the convicted killer's (Aaron Paul) guilt is called into question. (Sarah Koenig, of "Serial" fame, was reportedly enlisted as a consultant on the show.)
What's on TV
THE L WORD: GENERATION Q 10 p.m. on Showtime. It's been more than 10 years since "The L Word," Showtime's groundbreaking series about lesbian life in West Hollywood, went off the air. Now, a new cast representing a younger, more diverse and more fluid group of L.G.B.T.Q. characters has been tapped for a revival. "Generation Q" also stars the original cast members Jennifer Beals, Leisha Hailey and Katherine Moennig.
SILICON VALLEY 10 p.m. on HBO. The Pied Piper gang signs off for the final episode of this sendup of the Bay Area's tech gold rush. Writing about the sixth season for The New York Times, Farhad Manjoo points out that the show has grown over time to acknowledge the gloominess of the tech industry by asking: "Can good coexist with greed? Is it O.K. to act unethically in the service of ethical ends? Does money necessarily ruin everything -- and how much does that matter, if we're talking billions?" But as the series approaches its finale, Manjoo writes, "I'd rather Richard and the gang fail honorably, letting Pied Piper die, than succeed by selling out. But that, too, would be unreal."
MADAM SECRETARY 10:30 p.m. on CBS. From Secretary of State to the Oval Office, Elizabeth McCord (Téa Leoni) has governed with honor, intelligence and candor. Now, in the show's series finale, President McCord will embark on a new political initiative with help from members of the World Cup champion United States women's soccer team, while also trying to plan a family celebration.

Texto completo: I spent nearly three years photographing the Paralympic athlete Marieke Vervoort as she prepared to die by choice. It became one of the most emotional assignments -- and friendships -- of my life.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
In April 2017, The New York Times sent me to Japan to meet and photograph the decorated Paralympic athlete Marieke Vervoort while she carried out the last wish on her bucket list: dying.
Marieke was fresh off the Paralympic circuit, having just won bronze and silver medals in wheelchair racing in Rio de Janeiro in 2016. She had previously won gold in the 2015 world championships, as well as gold and silver in the 2012 London Paralympics. She was a celebrity in Belgium and in athletic circles for her athletic accomplishments and her public announcement that she had completed the paperwork to end her life by euthanasia.
Belgium, where Marieke lived, was one of just a handful of countries where euthanasia was legal for non-terminally ill patients. Marieke's degenerative muscular disease was not terminal, but as it worked its way up her body over two decades, it left behind a trail of paralysis.
I met and photographed Marieke in Japan, seven months after the Rio Games. She invited the Times sportswriter Andrew Keh and me to document her life, her suffering and her struggle with deciding when to die. She was savvy enough to understand that a poignant story and series of images could bring attention to her decade-long campaign for the global right to euthanasia. I ended up shuttling between my home in London and hers in Diest, Belgium, for two and a half years.
Marieke planned every detail of her death. She wanted to be surrounded by a handful of close friends and her parents in her bedroom in Diest when she was administered the lethal injection; she wanted to lie in a Coca-Cola red coffin surrounded by white roses; she carefully selected the speakers (including a comedian, whom she instructed to tell a dirty joke) and musicians for her private funeral. She would be cremated, and most of her ashes would be partitioned into little lockets for all her loved ones. A portion would be reserved and spread by her parents among the fields of lava by the dark blue sea in Los Hervideros, on the Spanish coast: her beloved second home, where she trained for the Paralympics.
She had no regrets. In fact, she had done more than most people do in 10 lifetimes.
But there never really seemed to be a right time to die. While Marieke first did the paperwork for euthanasia in 2008, she admitted she wasn't ready to end her life then. She just wanted the option of knowing she had the power and the permission to do so when the pain became unbearable. In the years I photographed Marieke, her condition deteriorated, and she selected three dates for euthanasia. All came and went, for different reasons, and the story -- and our friendship -- continued.
I have spent my entire career photographing people whose lives were stolen from them by measles or malaria in the Democratic Republic of Congo or South Sudan, malnutrition in Somalia or Yemen, a car bomb in Iraq or an airstrike in Syria. I've photographed families torn apart by war and extreme poverty. Until Marieke, I had never met someone who had elected to die. I had never met someone so full of life -- so emotionally determined that she could complete a triathlon in a wheelchair while deeply sick and heavily medicated -- but who couldn't muster that determination to plow through the daily pain and loneliness of a degenerative muscular disease, year after year.
I've never photographed someone so consistently over the span of two and a half years; inevitably, she became a friend. Most of the time I was with Marieke, I watched her sleep. I didn't photograph much. I learned how to hold her when she choked, to pat her back and comfort her, hoping she regained consciousness. Sometimes I took a photograph right away, and then tried to help -- because I was the only one in the room, and though I had been taught as a young photographer never to intervene, I am a human being.
I grew close to her parents, too -- especially her mother, who spoke little English. We messaged often in Dutch, assisted by Google Translate. Even though I'm not sure my messages ever really said what I intended, they enabled us to have a close relationship. As a mother, I couldn't fathom what she was going through as she ushered her daughter through moments of joy and darkness, only to know how and when it would all end. I admired the strength and support of Marieke's parents, to be able to let her go.
On Oct. 22, Marieke was scheduled to die at home in Diest -- this time, she hoped, for real.
A few weeks earlier, when Marieke and I discussed how she wanted me to photograph her death, she was more lucid than I had seen her in almost all the time I had known her. She vacillated between excited and strangely calm. The doubt was gone; she no longer booked dates into her schedule for months -- or weeks -- in the future. She asked me to be one of a handful of people in the room with her during her euthanasia.
Marieke's parents, Jos and Odette, sat at the foot of the bed, and everyone reluctantly took their places around her, forming a human cocoon. Her doctors alternated trips to her bedside, emptying fat syringes full of the barbiturate Thiobarbital into an IV line into her neck. Her parents sat before her. Every few minutes, her father looked away. Her longtime psychologist held her wrist.
By the end of her life, I knew most of Marieke's friends, and her dogs no longer barked when I arrived at her home to find her half-conscious on the couch. When I was back in London, or in Los Angeles over Christmas, she sent me long voice messages on WhatsApp -- during which she sometimes fell asleep, woke up again and picked up where she left off. She called me sweetheart and told me she loved me. I eventually reciprocated.
I don't know whether I crossed the lines of journalism by becoming close to my subject or who decides when it is O.K. for a "subject" to become a friend. I don't think my ability to tell Marieke's story has been compromised by our closeness, and I wouldn't know any other way to tell the story of someone's death by choice. I needed to get to know Marieke and her family to understand how painful and difficult life could be, to decide to end it.
The people in her bedroom that evening began to whimper and eventually sob, as the color drained from Marieke's face and her lips turned blue. She looked as she had so often throughout my time with her -- medicated, sleeping, mouth slightly agape -- but this time, for the first time, she looked at peace, without pain.

'I just wanted it all to be over': Katie Hill pens op-ed about contemplating suicide amid resignation

Texto completo: Former California Rep. Katie Hill wrote an op-ed for the New York Times detailing the despair she felt in the days after her resignation from the House of Representatives.
Hill, 32, resigned in October following the revelation that she had been in a romantic relationship with a female campaign aide. Intimate photos of Hill with the woman were leaked to a conservative news outlet and shared widely across the internet. Hill was also accused of being in a romantic relationship with a male employee, a claim she has consistently denied.
A freshman congresswoman, Hill spent less than a full year in Congress before being ousted as she faced an investigation by the House Ethics Committee into the alleged affairs with staff. "My life was just like everyone’s worst nightmare," Hill wrote in the New York Times. "Millions of people had seen pictures of me naked. Hundreds of journalists, commentators, politicians and public figures had written or spoken about my 'downfall,' the 'choices' I made, the lessons young people should take from what happened to me, the impact it would have on politics moving forward, the responsibility I bore for all of it."
Hill has said that her ex-husband was responsible for spreading the rumors about her relationship with a male campaign employee and that the nude photos of her were taken without her knowledge or permission. "After the images came out, as I lay curled up in my bed with my mind in the darkest places it’s ever been, countless texts and voice mails came from donors, friends, volunteers and voters sending love," she said. "But they couldn’t drown out the horrible messages and calls from people who found my phone number on the internet."
In the aftermath of her resignation, Hill described contemplating suicide. "I just wanted it all to be over," she said. "I got up and looked for the box cutter. I couldn’t find it. A part of my brain was saying: 'Stop it, this is stupid. You’re not going to do it.'" Hill then described how thinking of supporters and family changed her mind: "I thought about the people I had already let down so much. What would this do to my parents? To my brother and sister?"
Declining to speculate about future endeavors, Hill said that she anticipates more hardship. "I don’t know exactly what’s ahead for me, and I know there’s a lot more pain ahead," she wrote. "But I’m in the fight, and I’m glad it’s not all over after all."

Eric Walden: With David Fizdale’s firing, the Knicks’ clown car rolls merrily on

Texto completo: Does Knicks owner Jim Dolan really not understand why fans of the franchise clamor for him to sell the team? To his face? Does he think such occurrences are isolated incidents?
Probably.
There’s got to be a significant amount of hubris involved to not recognize that you, in fact, are the problem.
Coach David Fizdale was made the latest scapegoat for Dolan’s ineptitude on Friday afternoon, fired for amassing a 4-18 mark that included eight straight losses, the last two of which came Monday in a 44-point embarrassment against the Bucks, and Thursday in a mind-numbingly awful 37-point blowout at the hands of the Denver Nuggets.
To be fair, Fizdale was not particularly good — his .202 winning percentage over his 104-game tenure with the team is the fifth-worst with a single team, with a minimum of 100 games, over the last 30 NBA seasons, ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski reported.
The New York Times’ Marc Stein also noted that mark gave Fizdale the worst winning percentage among the 29 head coaches in Knicks history — worse even than the ignominious likes of Larry Brown and Derek Fisher, which takes some doing.
So yeah, even among the more veteran members of the Dolan Cast-offs Support Group, Fizdale was uniquely unsuccessful.
Then again, in his defense, none of his predecessors were ever gifted a roster comprised almost exclusively of power forwards.
Remember that spending spree the Knicks went on this past summer after both Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving made it apparent they wanted no part of that clown show (and the team responded by trying to spin it that they didn’t really want either player)?
Three years and $63 million for Julius Randle? Two years and $31M for Bobby Portis? Two years and $20M for Taj Gibson? One year, $15M for Marcus Morris? Also … Elfrid Payton, Wayne Ellington, and Reggie Bullock?
The Knicks’ top four signings in free agency ALL PLAY THE EXACT SAME POSITION. What was Fizdale supposed to do with that group?
That’s why it was particularly laughable when team president Steve Mills and general manager Scott Perry busted out an impromptu news conference following a rout at the hands of the Cavaliers back on Nov. 10 to opine that they had high expectations, and Fizdale wasn’t meeting them.
Why on earth would anyone have high expectations of that roster?
New York’s 100.5 points per game are last in the NBA. Their 42.2 FG%? Also last. The negative-10.8-point scoring differential? You guessed it — last. The 101.9 offensive rating (points scored per 100 possessions) is not merely last, but, as Woj noted, “on pace for the [league’s] worst mark since the 2015-16 Philadelphia 76ers, who finished 10-72.”
Again, Fizdale wasn’t awesome, but also again, it’s not like he had a well-constructed roster to work with.
Randle leads with team with 8.5 — Eight. Point. Five. — rebounds per game, which is bad enough. It’s worse still that he’s also leading the team with 3.5 assists per game. Dennis Smith Jr., the primary return piece in the trade that sent disgruntled star Kristaps Porzingis to Dallas, is shooting 33% from the field. Prized rookie RJ Barrett is shooting 39% overall and 30% from 3. Last year’s lottery pick, forward Kevin Knox, is averaging 7.9 points, 3.0 rebounds, 1.2 assists, 0.3 blocks, and is shooting 37%.
If John Wooden himself was brought in, he’d look at that group, shake his head, mutter a few expletives, and walk out the door.
No, no one other than the Knicks are blaming Fizdale for this mess.
“Im so happy for coach Fizdale!” ESPN analyst and former player Kendrick Perkins exclaimed live on the air, seconds after the news was broken. “… Scott Perry, Steve Mills — how long do they have? They’ve been running this for over a decade now, no success. Can’t keep blaming the coaches. I’m happy for Fizdale, in a good way.”
Except the team does keep blaming the coaches.
Since Dolan’s first full season as owner of the team, back in 1999-2000, the Knicks have had 12 head coaches. Jeff Hornacek, Kurt Rambis, Fisher, Mike Woodson, Mike D’Antoni, Isiah Thomas, Brown, Herb Williams, Lenny Wilkens, Williams (again), Don Chaney, even Jeff Van Gundy — all of them were the apparent problem at some point under Dolan’s watch.
Never mind that the Knicks have made the playoffs just five times in Dolan’s 19 seasons as owner, and have won just one playoff series in that span. Never mind that they’ve missed the postseason six straight times (soon to be seven). Or that, as Bloomberg noted this past July, New York’s .416 winning percentage is the worst of all NBA teams in the 21st century, “despite paying more luxury tax for exceeding the salary cap than any other franchise. In short, Dolan’s New York Knicks have spent the most to perform the worst.”
As David Fizdale might say, take that for data.
There’s one common denominator in all the Knicks’ awe-inspiring awfulness, and it isn’t him.

Texto completo: By Patricia Arrigoni
My dear friend Mary Ann Shaffer wrote a book about the German Nazi invasion and occupation of Guernsey Island during World War II titled "The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society." It was a huge hit and reached No. 1 on the New York Times bestseller list. The manuscript was sold in a worldwide auction that reached almost $1 million. A British film had showings in Europe and was finally sold to Netflix for American audiences.
Mary Ann passed away from cancer before the film based on her book was released. Her niece, Annie Barrows, a successful writer of children's books, was called in to help when Mary Ann became ill, and the publisher wanted her to expand upon the manuscript. Annie added a major character and did a wonderful job of enlarging the book.
While Mary Ann had visited Guernsey, I had never been there, so I jumped at the chance when I learned of a cruise that would call at St. Peter Port. I booked the cruise and arrived on Guernsey Island with my friend Rosemary Taylor from Kailua-Kona, Hawaii.
Upon arrival we stopped to view the harbor with its array of boats from elegant yachts to pleasure crafts and fishing boats. A busy street circled the harbor and ran up into the surrounding hills. The city is filled with handsome granite buildings, occasional cobblestone streets and boxes of flowers hanging everywhere that provide beauty and splashes of bright colors.
We had breakfast at the Terrace Garden Cafe, a restaurant with a picturesque patio covered with grape arbors plus some interesting sculptures. Here we met two local gentlemen, one of whom was Mike Prince. Along with other Guernsey children, Prince's mother was evacuated to England in World War II just ahead of the Nazi occupation that lasted from 1940 to1945. Once in England she was relocated to Manchester, where she later met her husband while working in a munitions factory.
Guernsey Island is 6 miles long and 4 miles wide (24 square miles), with a population of 64,000. The residents have their own government, and their monetary system is independent. Fishing -- especially for scallops, lobster, sea bass and crabs -- is a big industry.
Guernsey is noted for its 14th-century Castle Cornet, where concerts are held in the summers. Visitors may also visit the Guernsey Aquarium, Fort Saumarez, the Occupation Museum and the Little Chapel, which is decorated with pieces of broken china, pebbles and seashells.
Other places of interest include the facilities of the German Underground Hospital, Fort Grey (1804), Shipwreck Museum, Saumarez Manor, the Headquarters of the German Feld Kommandant (Grange Lodge Hotel), Vazon Bay, Fort Hommet and the Guernsey Folk and Costume Museum.From April to October 2020 Guernsey will be marking the 75th anniversary of its liberation from German occupying forces with "Heritage75," a major program of events and festivities. For more information, go to www.visitguernsey.com/heritage75.

Texto completo: In addition to his acclaimed turn as Roy Cohn on Broadway, he was known for his work in "Norma Rae," "Slaughterhouse-Five" and other films.
Ron Leibman, an actor whose career of more than six decades in film, television and the theater was highlighted by a Tony Award in 1993 for his electrifying performance as Roy Cohn in the first part of "Angels in America," died on Friday in Manhattan. He was 82.
A spokeswoman for the actress Jessica Walter, his wife, said the cause was pneumonia.
Mr. Leibman already had Drama Desk Awards for "We Bombed in New Haven" (1969) and "Transfers" (1970) as well as an Emmy for the short-lived CBS series "Kaz" (1979) when he took on the role of Cohn in "Angels in America," Tony Kushner's monumental two-part play about homosexuality and the age of AIDS. Cohn, a conservative lawyer and closeted gay man who was once chief counsel to Senator Joseph R. McCarthy and who died of AIDS in 1986, is a central figure in the work.
"Mr. Leibman, red-faced and cackling, is a demon of Shakespearean grandeur," Frank Rich wrote of the performance in "Millennium Approaches," the first part of "Angels," when he reviewed its Broadway premiere in The New York Times in May 1993, "an alternately hilarious and terrifying mixture of chutzpah and megalomania, misguided brilliance and relentless cunning. He turns the mere act of punching telephone buttons into a grotesque manipulation of the levers of power."
The performance brought Mr. Leibman the Tony for best actor in a play, one of four Tonys earned by Part 1. He also portrayed Cohn in Part 2, "Perestroika," which had its Broadway premiere that November, earning a Drama Desk nomination for outstanding supporting actor in a play.
So striking was Mr. Leibman's portrayal that no less an actor than F. Murray Abraham, an Oscar winner, found him a hard act to follow when he took over as Cohn in 1994.
"I found myself doing Ron," Mr. Abraham told The Times. "Doing his voice. His mannerisms. It was exasperating."
Mr. Leibman was often asked what it was like to play a widely reviled real-life figure like Cohn.
"If, as an actor, you're going to portray any human being, you'd best not have an attitude about that person," he said in 1993. "If I had to make a moral judgment about every character, I wouldn't play Richard III, I wouldn't play Macbeth, or Coriolanus, or King Lear. Cohn was a human being."
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Ron Leibman was born on Oct. 11, 1937, in Manhattan to Murray and Grace (Marx) Leibman. His father worked in the garment industry, and his mother was a homemaker.
After a childhood that included several serious illnesses, he enrolled at Ohio Wesleyan University, where he discovered his love for the theater. After graduating, he spent time with the Compass Players, an improvisational troupe that performed in Chicago and St. Louis in the mid-1950s, then returned to New York and joined the Actors Studio, supporting himself with work as a shoe salesman and cabdriver.
Mr. Leibman was first and foremost a stage actor. His first professional role was in a summer theater production of Arthur Miller's "A View From the Bridge." One of his first New York appearances was in 1959 as Orpheus in a production of Jean Anouilh's "Legend of Lovers" at the 41st Street Theater.
He made his Broadway debut in March 1963 in the comedy "Dear Me, the Sky Is Falling," and over the next year had minor roles in two other Broadway plays, "The Deputy" and "Bicycle Ride to Nevada."
In 1967 he was in the premiere of Joseph Heller's antiwar black comedy "We Bombed in New Haven" at the Yale School of Drama Repertory Theater in New Haven, along with several other actors who would soon be better known.
"Stacy Keach evokes a terrible tattered passion as the ramrod-straight, chicken-hearted captain," Clive Barnes wrote in a review in The Times, "and he is perfectly matched by Ron Leibman, moving from the flip to the hunted, as the sergeant who doesn't want to die." Estelle Parsons was also in the cast.
Mr. Leibman stayed with the show when it moved to Broadway in 1968. His next Broadway appearance was in 1969 in a one-act, "Cop-Out," which was most notable for his playing opposite Linda Lavin. They married that year and divorced in 1981.
Mr. Leibman's other Broadway credits included the Neil Simon comedy "Rumors," in 1988, joining a cast that also included Christine Baranski. Mr. Rich, in a mixed review, found the play amusing "provided that either Ron Leibman or Christine Baranski is kvelling at center stage."
Mr. Leibman's "Angels" performance, his last on Broadway, was still reverberating in the Manhattan air in 1995 when he played Shylock in "The Merchant of Venice" at the Public Theater.
"This is a harrowing, fierce and complicated performance," Linda Winer wrote in Newsday, "one that, consciously or not, makes a seductive ancestral connection between oppression and accommodation, between the hurt Jewish moneylender with his demand for a 'pound of flesh' and Cohn, the flamboyantly amoral New York lawyer."
Mr. Leibman's television and film career was less extensive than his stage work. Among his film highlights was "Slaughterhouse-Five," the 1972 movie version of Kurt Vonnegut's novel, in which he played the prisoner of war Lazzaro. Kevin Kelly, writing in The Boston Globe, called his performance "fierce and frightening."
His character in "Kaz," the CBS series for which he won an Emmy (and which he also helped write), also had an edge; here he was an offbeat lawyer who earned his law degree in prison. In an April 1979 interview with The Times, Mr. Leibman vented about the network's handling of the series, which had made its debut the previous fall but was not given a consistent schedule.
"I mean, how can a show make it if you pre-empt it eight out of 12 weeks for things like 'Marlon Brando Sings the Favorites of Mickey Rooney'?" he said.
His concerns were well founded. Despite his Emmy, the series was canceled after one season.
Mr. Leibman also played a labor organizer in the 1979 film "Norma Rae" -- a role he credited with convincing casting directors that he could play something other than an unhinged guy, as he had been in "We Bombed in New Haven," "Slaughterhouse-Five" and the 1970 movie "Where's Poppa?"'
"I would have walked down the street naked to get that part," he said.
Mr. Leibman and Ms. Walter married in 1983. They had recently both been voicing characters on the animated series "Archer." In addition to her, he is survived by a stepdaughter, Brooke Bowman, and a grandson.
In a 2011 interview with the website AV Club, Mr. Leibman said it was his stepdaughter who had encouraged him to take a part on television that he had initially rejected, not being familiar with the show. It was a recurring role on "Friends" as the father of Rachel Green, Jennifer Aniston's character. He was a little confused at first.
"When I first came on," he said, "I didn't know who was who, because I'd never seen the show. So I started talking to Lisa Kudrow, thinking she was Jennifer Aniston. I had no idea."

'I would be a coward if I didn't speak out': Comey blasts Mattis for silence on Trump

Texto completo: Former FBI Director James Comey expressed his disappointment with former Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis for not speaking out against President Trump since he left the administration.
Comey, who has been a vocal critic of Trump since being fired in May 2017, said he would be a "coward" for not speaking out and questioned the former defense secretary's reluctance to denounce Trump or his policies.
After calling himself "an admirer of Jim Mattis as a leader" during a book conversation in New York City on Wednesday, Comey said, "I don't get his explanation for why he isn't speaking about what he knows."
"He doesn't have to share confidential, classified conversations with the president," Comey continued. "But you are a civilian leader who has a perspective that would be useful to the American people. What's the reason you're not sharing that?"
Mattis, 69, resigned from office last year. His departure reportedly was a result of disagreements with Trump over U.S. policy in Syria. Mattis didn’t support drawing back troops from the region, while Trump did.
While on a book tour this fall, the retired four-star Marine Corps general described what he called a "duty of silence" upon leaving the administration in order to preserve national security while Trump is in office. “We have to give the people who are protecting us some time to carry out their duties without me adding my criticism to the cacophony that is right now so poisonous," Mattis said in an interview with the Atlantic.
Mattis, who explained it would be improper to "endanger the country by attacking the elected commander in chief," also said he would not be silent forever.
This is not to say Mattis has been completely unwilling to take swipes at Trump. After the president was said to have called Mattis "the world’s most overrated general," he ribbed the commander in chief during a joke-filled speech at the white-tie Al Smith Dinner in October.
"I guess I'm the Meryl Streep of generals, and frankly, that sounds pretty good to me," Mattis said, referring to the Academy Award-winning actress. "And you do have to admit that, between me and Meryl, at least we've had some victories."
By comparison, Comey has been very open about his disapproval of Trump, who, in turn, called Comey's behavior treasonous. He leaked memos of his conversations with the president, in what he has described as an effort to spark a special counsel investigation. This prompted a stern rebuke from the Justice Department inspector general, who found Comey "violated" FBI rules.
Comey, 58, also wrote a book, A Higher Loyalty, which was very critical of Trump while calling for "ethical leadership."
Comey's critique of Mattis took place during a sit-down discussion with New York Times columnist James Stewart, who recently had a book published: Deep State: Trump, the FBI, and the Rule of Law.
"None of us who are worried about the integrity of this country, it's intelligence judgments, and the rule of law should hesitate to say that's not okay. Even if people are going to say, 'Oh, you're a partisan pundit.' Rod Rosenstein has called me a 'partisan pundit.' I don't care. We can't be cowed or numbed into silence," Comey said, referring to the deputy attorney general who wrote a memo cited in his firing.
"Just because the conduct is so outrageous in a way that increases — I don't love this phase of my life, as I've told you. But I would be a coward if I didn't speak out when I know things I can say, I have a perspective, and I have a platform. I want this part of my life to go away, and I'd like it to go away soon," he added, to cheers.

Texto completo: Authorities have detained six Saudi nationals for questioning in connection with a mass shooting at the Naval Air Station in Pensacola, Florida, on Friday.
A member of the Royal Saudi Air Force opened fire with a handgun in a classroom on base, killing three and injuring at least seven before being killed by police. A source briefed on the investigation told the New York Times that six people had been detained for questioning. Three of those people were seen filming the incident as it unfolded.
Officials are looking into whether to classify the shooting as an act of terrorism. Some lawmakers are already calling the gunman a terrorist.
The gunman killed two during the attack and wounded eight others, including two deputies that engaged him. The eight injured were transported to a local hospital were one later died, according to the Navy.
President Trump said on Twitter that he was following the situation and offered support for the families of the victims.
"My thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families during this difficult time. We are continuing to monitor the situation as the investigation is ongoing," Trump said.
Trump also relayed a message he received from Saudi Arabia's King Salman bin Abdulaziz al Saud in the aftermath of the attack.
"King Salman of Saudi Arabia just called to express his sincere condolences and give his sympathies to the families and friends of the warriors who were killed and wounded in the attack that took place in Pensacola, Florida," Trump said.

Texto completo: I was a socialist in college. I read magazines like The Nation and old issues of The New Masses. I dreamed of being the next Clifford Odets, a lefty playwright who was always trying to raise proletarian class consciousness. If you go on YouTube and search “David Brooks Milton Friedman,” you can see a 22-year-old socialist me debating the great economist. I’m the one with the bushy hair and the giant 1980s glasses that were apparently on loan from the Palomar lunar observatory.
The best version of socialism is defined by Michael Walzer’s phrase, “what touches all should be decided by all.” The great economic enterprises should be owned by all of us in common. Decisions should be based on what benefits all, not the maximization of profit.
That’s not what “democratic socialists” like Bernie Sanders are talking about, but I get why some of their socialist concerns are popular. Why do we have to live with such poverty and inequality? Why can’t we put people over profits? What is the best life in the most just society? Socialism is the most compelling secular religion of all time. It gives you an egalitarian ideal to sacrifice and live for.
My socialist sympathies didn’t survive long once I became a journalist. I quickly noticed that the government officials I was covering were not capable of planning the society they hoped to create. It wasn’t because they were bad or stupid. The world is just too complicated.
I came to realize that capitalism is really good at doing the one thing socialism is really bad at: creating a learning process to help people figure stuff out. If you want to run a rental car company, capitalism has a whole bevy of market and price signals and feedback loops that tell you what kind of cars people want to rent, where to put your locations, how many cars to order. It has a competitive profit-driven process to motivate you to learn and innovate, every single day.
Socialist planned economies — the common ownership of the means of production — interfere with price and other market signals in a million ways. They suppress or eliminate profit motives that drive people to learn and improve.
It doesn’t matter how big your computers are, the socialist can never gather all relevant data, can never construct the right feedback loops. The state cannot even see the local, irregular, context-driven factors that can have exponential effects. The state cannot predict people’s desires, which sometimes change on a whim. Capitalism creates a relentless learning system. Socialism doesn’t.
The sorts of knowledge that capitalism produces are often not profound, like how to design the best headphone. But that kind of knowledge does produce enormous wealth. Human living standards were pretty much flat for all of human history until capitalism kicked in. Since then, the number of goods and services available to average people has risen by up to 10,000%.
If you’ve been around a little while, you’ve noticed that capitalism has brought about the greatest reduction of poverty in human history. In 1981, 42% of the world lived in extreme poverty. Now, it’s around 10%. More than 1 billion people have been lifted out of poverty.
You’ve noticed that places that instituted market reforms, like South Korea and Deng Xiaoping’s China, tended to get richer and prouder. Places that moved toward socialism — Britain in the 1970s, Venezuela more recently — tended to get poorer and more miserable.
You’ve noticed that the environment is much better in capitalist nations than in planned economies. The American GDP has more than doubled since 1970, but energy consumption has risen only modestly. America’s per-capita carbon emissions hit a 67-year low in 2017. The greatest environmental degradations are committed by planned systems like the old Soviet Union and communist China.
The Fraser Institute is a free-market think tank that ranks nations according to things free-market think tanks like: less regulation, free trade, secure property rights. The freest economies in the world are places like Hong Kong, the U.S., Canada, Ireland, Latvia, Denmark, Mauritius, Malta and Finland. Nations in the top quartile for economic freedom have an average GDP per capita of $36,770. For those in the bottom quartile, it’s $6,140. People in the free economies have a life expectancy of 79.4 years. Those in the planned economies have a life expectancy of 65.2 years.
Over the past century, planned economies have produced an enormous amount of poverty and scarcity. What’s worse is what happens when the political elites learn what you can do with that scarcity. They turn scarcity into corruption. When things are scarce, you have to bribe government officials to get them. Soon, everybody is bribing. Citizens soon realize the whole system is a fraud. Socialism produces economic and political inequality as the rulers turn into gangsters. A system that begins in high idealism ends in corruption, dishonesty, oppression and distrust.
I learned the ills of socialism quickly ... and became a Whig slowly.
My first economic hero is Alexander Hamilton. He came to America with almost nothing and found an economy dominated by land-rich oligarchs like Thomas Jefferson. He realized that the solution was to make everyone a capitalist. He created credit markets so that capital would be fluid and more people would have access to investments.
My next hero is Abraham Lincoln. He grew up poor and launched his career as a Whig. He gave more speeches on banking and infrastructure projects than on slavery. That’s because he wanted to spread capital and grease the wheels of commerce so poor boys and girls like him could rise. He helped create the land-grant colleges so that more people would have the training to compete as capitalists.
Another major American figure in the Whig tradition is Theodore Roosevelt. He loved the dynamism that capitalism arouses and knew that sometimes you have to limit giant corporations so millions of less established capitalists can compete.
All of these leaders understood that the answer to the problems of capitalism is wider and fairer capitalism.
Today, parts of our capitalist system in the United States are in good shape. Growth is remarkably steady, inflation is low, employment is high, wages for the poorest Americans are rising twice as fast as for high-wage workers.
But capitalism, like all human systems, is always unbalanced one way or another. Over the last generation, capitalism has produced the greatest reduction in global income inequality in history. The downside is that low-skill workers in the U.S. are now competing with workers in Vietnam, India and Malaysia. The reduction of inequality among nations has led to the increase of inequality within rich nations, like the United States.
Also, education levels have not kept pace with technology. More people grow up with inadequate schools, disrupted families and fragmented neighborhoods. They find it harder to acquire the skills to become good capitalists. The market is effectively closed off to them.
These problems are not signs that capitalism is broken. They are signs that we need more and better capitalism. We need a massive infusion of money and reform into our education systems, from infancy through life. Human capital-building is like nutrition: It’s something you have to attend to every day. We need welfare programs that not only subsidize poor people’s consumption but also subsidize their capacity to produce.
We need worker co-ops, which build skills and represent labor at the negotiating table. We need wage subsidies and mobility subsidies, so people can afford to move to opportunity. We need tax subsidies for health care, to make it easier for people to switch jobs. We need a higher earned-income tax credit, to give the working poor financial security so they don’t get swept away amid the creative destruction. We need a carbon tax, to give everyone an incentive to reduce carbon emissions without pretending we know the best way to do it.
Every single idea I just mentioned comes from the American Enterprise Institute or Brookings or some other institution derided as being part of the neoliberal elite. All these ideas would make capitalism work better.
A big mistake those of us on the conservative side made was to think that anything that made the government bigger also made the market less dynamic. We failed to distinguish between the supportive state and the regulatory state. The supportive state makes better and more secure capitalists. The Scandinavian nations have very supportive welfare states. They also have very free markets. The only reason they can afford to have generous welfare states is they also have very free markets.
I don’t know if the Scandinavian welfare model would work in nations as big and diverse as the U.S. But its success points to a few truths: The state nurtures prosperity when it helps people become capitalists. The state causes incredible levels of misery when it gets too far inside the decision-making processes of capitalists. It creates enormous misery when it cripples the motivational system that drives capitalism. Its causes enormous misery when it meddles with the relentless learning system that market mechanisms make possible.
Capitalism is not a religion. It won’t save your soul or fulfill the yearnings of your heart. But somehow it will arouse your energies, it will lift your sights, it will put you on a lifelong learning journey to know, to improve, to dare and to dare again.
Last Sunday I attended a service with a young friend at a church that has quickly become a home for her. There were several hundred congregants — 90% were under 30; 90% percent were Latino. The service was two hours of joy and exultation — glow sticks and song and balloons.
They weren’t worshipping capitalism, but something higher. But still their work lives came into view. “Look how far we’ve come! Look how far we’ve come!” different people kept saying. I saw my own family’s Jewish immigration history being re-enacted right in front of me. We, like they, started out as butchers and seamstresses and tailors, self-employed capitalists because it can be hard for immigrants to get corporate jobs. The opportunity explosion my family experienced and your family probably experienced is happening still, made possible by the ever-expanding pie that capitalism provides.
The theme that day was hope, transcendent hope and more immediate hope. “Move and miracles happen!” a young Latino woman sang. Every year, hundreds of millions of people march with their feet to capitalism.
Today, the real argument is not between capitalism and socialism. We ran that social experiment for 100 years and capitalism won. It’s between a version of democratic capitalism, found in the U.S., Canada and Denmark, and forms of authoritarian capitalism, found in China and Russia. Our job is to make it the widest and fairest version of capitalism it can possibly be.

Texto completo: How much would you pay for a banana duct-taped to a wall?
At Art Basel Miami Beach, a massive art fair that includes top contemporary artists and attracts buyers like Beyoncé and Jay-Z, you'd need at least $120,000 to go home with such an affixed fruit, according to multiple media reports.
A piece at the fair called “Comedian" has the appearance of, well, how you'd imagine a banana duct-taped to a wall would look. A gray strip cuts across the yellow fruit, fastening it in place. In at least one edition of the work, the fruit is flecked with brown spots.
It is the creation of Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan.
CNN reported that two of the three editions of “Comedian" have already sold for $120,000, with the third going for an even larger sum.
Messages left with Perrotin, the art gallery that presented the work, were not immediately returned Friday evening.
It was not immediately clear who bought the bananas and strips of tape. No word, either, on what the buyers planned to do with the fruits once they started to decompose.
For perspective, at 50 cents a pound, $120,000 could get you 120 tons of bananas from your local Whole Foods. That sum could also get you four new Toyota Camrys, 53 Peloton bikes, or 481 pairs of Apple's AirPods Pro. It is slightly less than double the median annual household income for Boston.
On its website, Perrotin describes Cattelan as “one of the most popular and controversial artists on the contemporary art scene."
“His playful and provocative use of materials, objects, and gestures set in challenging contexts forces commentary and engagement," the gallery said on its website.
The Miami Beach art fair includes more than 200 of “the world's leading international Modern and contemporary art galleries." It features displays from more than 4,000 artists, including paintings, sculptures, installations, photography, film, video, and digital art, according to the show's website.
The show started Tuesday and opened to the public on Thursday. It will remain open to the public through Sunday.
Previously, Cattelan created a functioning toilet made entirely from 18-carat gold thought to be worth about $6 million. That piece, called “America," was stolen from Blenheim Palace in England earlier this year, CNN reported.

Explainer: The McKinsey controversy

Texto completo: McKinsey & Company, the elite management consulting firm, likes to keep a tight lid on its projects.
The discretion is, in part, about protecting its clients — some of the largest companies and mightiest governments in the world. But the firm also has to worry about its own reputation; McKinsey doesn't want to be known for doing ethically dubious errands for the powerful.
Lately however, some of the company's most sensitive work has won unwanted attention. A lawsuit filed by Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey showed how it advised Purdue Pharma on boosting sales of Oxycontin and tamping down bad publicity around opioid overdoses. McKinsey's consulting for authoritarian regimes in China and Saudi Arabia has drawn scrutiny. And the firm has been implicated in a huge scandal involving a South African energy company that led to the resignation of the country's former president, Jacob Zuma.
Last week, the New York Times and ProPublica, the non-profit investigative journalism outfit, co-published a piece detailing McKinsey's work for Immigration and Customs Enforcement — helping the federal agency execute President Trump's controversial crackdown on illegal immigration and recommending that the agency spend less on food and medical care for migrants who have been detained.
Here, in the first installment of a new Ideas feature explaining and contextualizing recent news that you may have missed: a look at the latest McKinsey controversy.
What did the New York Times/ProPublica investigation find? McKinsey, first hired by the Obama administration to help with an “organizational transformation" of an ICE division, quickly pivoted to work on Trump's immigration clampdown. The firm's cost-cutting proposals — including reduced spending on food and medical care for migrants — made some career ICE employees uncomfortable.
“The consultants, three people who worked on the project said, seemed focused solely on cutting costs and speeding up deportations — actions whose success could be measured in numbers — with little acknowledgment that these policies affected thousands of human beings," the Times and ProPublica reported.
The firm also worked with ICE to speed up the recruitment and hiring of immigration officers. Attempts to do so by previous administrations “ended badly," the Times and ProPublica reported, resulting in “lax hiring standards" and “a subsequent spike in misconduct and corruption cases among Border Patrol officers." Ultimately, budget constraints meant ICE hired only a fraction of the 10,000 new officers the president called for. And some of the McKinsey proposals that career ICE employees found most objectionable — like cutting spending on food and medicine — were never put into effect.
McKinsey has pushed back on the Times and ProPublica report, arguing that its efforts to speed up hiring and win lower prices for vendor services like health care was just a continuation of its work under Obama.
“As a firm," McKinsey said, in a statement after the article was published, “we are committed to supporting the United States' legacy of welcoming immigrants."
What's the fallout? McKinsey's work with ICE ended in July 2018, after an earlier Times report called attention to the contract. But shortly thereafter, the firm signed a contract with another federal agency involved in Trump's immigration crackdown, Customs and Border Protection — inviting more of the scrutiny McKinsey so likes to avoid.
The bad press — on the ICE contract and previous work — is becoming something of a problem for Pete Buttigieg, the Democratic presidential hopeful who worked for the firm from June 2007 to March 2010. McKinsey was working for Purdue Pharma, one of the biggest drivers of the opioid epidemic, during that period. Buttigieg says he was unaware of that work at the time.
He's made some oblique references to his own endeavors at McKinsey — saying he examined grocery pricing and traveled to Afghanistan and Iraq. But he says he's unable to talk about his assignments in detail because of a non-disclosure agreement. His campaign says it has contacted McKinsey to explore whether he might be released from it.
But the New York Times editorial board and other critics have argued he needs to do more to shed light on his McKinsey tenure.

What Would We Do Without Experts? U.S. job growth continues to beat expectations.

Texto completo: There's no recession in sight as the U.S. economy continues to create new opportunities and defy the expectations of professional forecasters. Yesterday, on news of another surge in hiring among small businesses, this column asked if anything can stop the great American jobs machine. Today's Labor Department report on the whole economy adds an exclamation point to that question.
The Journal's Sarah Chaney reports :
The U.S. job market strengthened in November, as hiring jumped and unemployment fell to a half-century low, adding fuel to the economic expansion.
Employers added 266,000 jobs in November—the fastest pace since 312,000 in January—and the jobless rate dipped to 3.5%, matching September as the lowest level since 1969, the Labor Department said Friday. Wages also advanced 3.1% from a year earlier.
"This is a 'who would have thought moment?'" said Becky Frankiewicz, president of staffing company ManpowerGroup's North America division. "No one would have ever guessed we could be sitting at 3.5% unemployment with 110 months of job gains."
Certainly such guesses were rare among people paid to make economic forecasts. Neil Irwin notes in the New York Times the big lesson from the current robust labor market:
... the American economy is capable of cranking at a higher level than conventional wisdom held as recently as a few years ago. As the economy continues to grow well above what once seemed like its potential, without inflation or other clear signs of overheating, it's clearer that the old view of its potential was an extremely costly mistake.
The mainstream view of the economics profession — held by leaders of the Federal Reserve, the Congressional Budget Office, private forecasters and many in academia — was that the United States economy was at, or close to, full employment.
In January 2017, for example, nearly three years ago, the Congressional Budget Office forecast a 4.7 percent unemployment rate as far as the eye could see, and it projected that the United States labor force would consist of 163.3 million in 2019. The jobless rate has averaged less than 3.7 percent through the first 11 months of the year, and the labor force now stands at 164.4 million people.
Donald Luskin of Trend Macrolytics writes in a note to clients that today's jobs report was so good, it seems too good to be true:
This morning's November Employment Situation report was a huge beat versus expectations for only 180,000 – and all the more so in that upward revisions of 41,000 to the prior two months' reports raised the bar. Those upward revisions include 28,000 to October's payrolls, which was already a blockbuster beat. 45,000 or so November payrolls are the result of automotive workers coming back from a strike, but that would have been anticipated in the consensus.
This report flies in the face of contemporaneous labor market data, which indicates in aggregate that employment increased only from 137,000 to 151,000 jobs – and indeed a tepid 81,000 new jobs reported in the "household survey" this morning confirms this. We have to think that these blockbuster payroll numbers are going to get revised lower. Nevertheless, they could get revised a lot lower and they'd still be strong – depriving those expecting a recession around the corner of a necessary argument.
Meanwhile Joseph Lavorgna at Natixis says the "latest employment figures are robust, and the rate of productivity is trending higher. Additionally, these trends are expected to persist, setting the stage for an acceleration in real GDP growth in 2020." He says that job growth plus productivity indicates that real economic growth "could soon exceed 3%."
Everyday consumers seem to have been ahead of the forecasting pros on this one. Ms. Chaney notes:
Evidence suggests the resilience of households is poised to continue. Americans' view of the economic outlook improved significantly in December, according to a University of Michigan consumer-sentiment survey released Friday... Wages are growing faster for rank-and-file workers than the overall labor force.
So along with robust job growth the economy is lately producing rising wages and less income inequality. Merry Christmas!

The Treatment of Turley
"The most dangerous place for an academic is often between the House and the impeachment of an American president. I knew that going into the first hearing of the House Judiciary Committee on the impeachment of Donald Trump... My call for greater civility and dialogue may have been the least successful argument I made to the committee. Before I finished my testimony, my home and office were inundated with threatening messages and demands that I be fired from George Washington University for arguing that, while a case for impeachment can be made, it has not been made on this record," Jonathan Turley in The Hill, Dec. 5

Texto completo: Anne Hathaway didn't have to dig deep for her latest role in "Dark Waters."
In Todd Haynes' whistleblower drama, the Oscar winner plays the real-life Sarah Bilott, whose husband, lawyer Rob Bilott (Mark Ruffalo), helped expose decades of environmental contamination by chemical company DuPont.
"It's heartbreaking and infuriating on a human level," Hathaway says. "There wasn't really any acting required, in terms of playing someone who was learning of (corruption) and was equal parts aghast and terrified and angry and emotional."
Based on a 2016 New York Times Magazine article by Nathaniel Rich, "Dark Waters" begins with Rob taking on a new client: a West Virginia farmer (Bill Camp) who believes his cows' mysterious deaths are caused by a toxic runoff from a DuPont landfill, which contaminated a creek on his land.
Rob's work eventually leads to a study that finds roughly 70,000 people were drinking tainted water with traces of PFOA, a toxic chemical used in the production of Teflon products such as non-stick pans until 2013. DuPont was allegedly aware for years that PFOA exposure is linked to illnesses such as kidney cancer and thyroid disease, and the company was forced to pay out $671 million in personal injury lawsuits in 2017.
The story hit close to home for Hathaway, 37, already a mom to son Jonathan, 3, with husband Adam Shulman, and now "a thousand months pregnant" with a second child, she says good-naturedly by phone.
After reading the script, "I opened the drawer where I keep my pans and pots, and there was a non-stick pan," Hathaway says. "And despite reading an article when I was pregnant with my first child that said 'don't use non-stick,' there was one that had somehow slipped through the cracks and I'd been feeding my family with it for years.

Dishing out some honesty on starving students

Texto completo: Before I succumb to the holiday spirit, I'm having an Ebenezer Scrooge moment.
Americans gripe about how immigrants want handouts, but the folks that I most often see panhandling appear to be native-born. They stand at intersections and hold up signs that read: "Will work for food."
I think to myself: "That's a coincidence. I do work for food."
In fact, I work 60 hours and seven days a week for food — to feed myself, my wife and our three kids.
Lately, I've been reading a lot about how America's colleges and universities are full of starving students.
Typical is an article that ran in The New York Times in May that featured college seniors who dream about being able to start their day with breakfast, or wind up so delirious from hunger that they wander aimlessly, or take "poverty naps" rather than think about how hungry they are. It's called "food insecurity."
The story cited a Temple University survey that found that 45% of students from more than 100 institutions said they had been food insecure in the past 30 days.
About this, we should be immensely concerned. And, if you are, that makes you a good person. On the other hand, if you are not, you're a heartless ogre who deserves to be hunted by villagers carrying torches and pitchforks.
Since I have, in my more than three decades in the business, known more columnists who fit into the second category than into the first, I feel confident in proceeding with a dab of skepticism.
For instance, we should note upfront that these citadels of higher learning are, by definition, places of privilege — because, while a high school diploma may not get you far in a global economy, a college degree is not what Thomas Jefferson conceived of as an unalienable right.
It does seem as if every generation feels as if it is going through something truly awful that no other generation has ever had to endure.
Right. You don't suppose the members of the World War II generation who grew up during the Great Depression knew anything about hunger pangs?
We were all starving students — from baby boomers to Generation X to millennials. We all smuggled apples, cookies and cereal boxes back to our dorm rooms from the dining hall, or lived on ramen as we plowed through unpaid summer internships that would supposedly pay off in the future.
I spent a summer in New York before my senior year, where — after paying rent — I lived on $10 a day and walked home from work 60 blocks in awful humidity rather than surrender the lone subway token in my pocket.
OK, Gen X'er. That's different. Those were rites of passage. For members of so-called "Generation Z" or "iGen," empty stomachs are suddenly a matter of life and death.
I'm reminded of a funny line from the 1990s television show "Ally McBeal," where the lead character — a narcissistic young lawyer in Boston — is asked: "What makes your problems so much bigger than everybody else's?" Ally responds matter-of-factly: "They're mine."
Nonetheless, we are told by the media that the latest batch of starving students have it worse than anyone else has ever had it in the history of higher education. Paying exorbitant tuitions, and forced to choose between buying books or food, many students may fail out because they're famished.
Many colleges and universities now have on-campus food pantries where hungry students can drop in for a snack between classes.
That's a great idea, and a much-preferred alternative to proposed federal legislation to pay off student debt or make college free for everyone.
Still, these stories about campus starvation have left me hungry for three things that they lack: context, honesty and common sense.
It seems to me that college students who feel food insecure might think about getting a part-time job like many of us had while we were in school. Maybe they could work in the dining hall or a nearby restaurant and eat for free. Or maybe they could move back home, commute to a nearby college, and let mom and dad feed them. Or maybe they could use some of their textbook money to buy food, and check out the books they need from the library.
I mean, if it's not too much of an inconvenience.
The first thing they need to do is grow up. Life is hard. But it doesn't have to be this complicated.
Bah humbug!

Pence tours West Michigan to stir evangelical base

Texto completo: While President Donald Trump continues to battle accusations of corruption relating to his dealings with Ukraine, Vice President Mike Pence toured parts of West Michigan on Wednesday to connect with one of the campaigns most reliable voter blocs — evangelicals.
Pence arrived in Kalamazoo shortly before noon. He was greeted by Michigan Republican Party Chairwoman Laura Cox before meeting supporters at a local church. Pence arrived in West Michigan as part of a day of scheduled bus tour stops, culminating with a rally in Holland later Wednesday.
Pence met with faith and community leaders before attending a "Keep America Great" event with former White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.
Pence's tour through parts of West Michigan coincides with the ongoing impeachment inquiry in Washington.
While Pence had mostly stayed away from the topic, he addressed impeachment in front of evangelical supporters during his first stop in Kalamazoo, maligning it as "three years of endless investigation."
"As partisan impeachment continues today, I've come here to Michigan to talk about all that we've accomplished here, because it really is a lot," Pence said.
The Trump campaign secured a substantial majority of white, evangelical voters in 2016, and Pence's visit aimed at rallying that base.
He told the audience of about 50 people at Valley Church of Kalamazoo that Democrats were straying too far to the left.
"We've seen the Democratic Party nationally take a leftward turn like I'd never thought I'd see in my lifetime," Pence said. "It's amazing to think at a time when life and liberty are winning in America, the Democratic Party today is embracing far left, radical policies on economic issues and on social issues and the values we most cherish.
"Socialism is a scourge, yet now we have leading voices in the Democratic Party (embracing it)."
Democratic presidential nominees like Sen. Bernie Sanders, D-Vermont, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, have called for higher tax rates on the ultra-rich.
According to a recent New York Times and Siena College poll in November, Trump trailed Sanders by two points but led Warren by six points among a survey of registered voters in Michigan.
In Holland, Pencewass expected to speak about President Trump's time in office and the importance of Michigan in the 2020 election.
The Holland stop is Pence's first return to the state since attending the Republican Leadership Conference on Sept. 21 on Mackinac Island, and his first trip back to Holland since Nov. 5, 2016.

Texto completo: Anne Hathaway didn't have to dig deep for her latest role in "Dark Waters."
In Todd Haynes' whistleblower drama, the Oscar winner plays the real-life Sarah Bilott, whose husband, lawyer Rob Bilott (Mark Ruffalo), helped expose decades of environmental contamination by chemical company DuPont.
"It's heartbreaking and infuriating on a human level," Hathaway says. "There wasn't really any acting required, in terms of playing someone who was learning of (corruption) and was equal parts aghast and terrified and angry and emotional."
Based on a 2016 New York Times Magazine article by Nathaniel Rich, "Dark Waters" begins with Rob taking on a new client: a West Virginia farmer (Bill Camp) who believes his cows' mysterious deaths are caused by a toxic runoff from a DuPont landfill, which contaminated a creek on his land.
Rob's work eventually leads to a study that finds roughly 70,000 people were drinking tainted water with traces of PFOA, a toxic chemical used in the production of Teflon products such as non-stick pans until 2013. DuPont was allegedly aware for years that PFOA exposure is linked to illnesses such as kidney cancer and thyroid disease, and the company was forced to pay out $671 million in personal injury lawsuits in 2017.
The story hit close to home for Hathaway, 37, already a mom to son Jonathan, 3, with husband Adam Shulman, and now "a thousand months pregnant" with a second child, she says good-naturedly by phone.
After reading the script, "I opened the drawer where I keep my pans and pots, and there was a non-stick pan," Hathaway says. "And despite reading an article when I was pregnant with my first child that said 'don't use non-stick,' there was one that had somehow slipped through the cracks and I'd been feeding my family with it for years.
"I try not to blame myself too hard in those circumstances, because I believe that we as human beings and as Americans should never be put in that position where we're just trying to do our best, and we're inadvertently poisoning ourselves and the people we love."
Hathaway has always had an activist spirit, which is part of the reason why Haynes thought of her to play Sarah.
"Anne has this incredible vitality and intelligence and compassion, and you see that in her work," says the director, best known for the Oscar-nominated "Carol" and "Far from Heaven." "Sarah is an essential part of the story of Rob and how he was able to do what he did, but also how hard it is on a domestic relationship when somebody takes on the system."
A vocal member of the Time's Up movement against sexual harassment and workplace discrimination, Hathaway credits her activism to her parents, who instilled the importance of equality and inclusivity from an early age.
"I was born in the early '80s, and there were still things I was told I couldn't do because I was a girl," Hathaway says. "I was really lucky I was raised in a household where that sentence was never uttered. It seems strange to me that anybody would try to put me in a box based on the way I was born, when it's so much easier to just accept other people for how they are. So I guess that was my first awareness that the world wasn't a fair place for everyone."
The actress says she is grateful for her "Dark Waters" co-star Ruffalo, who has long spoken out about climate change and fracking. She also feels encouraged by the work of 16-year-old Greta Thunberg and other young environmental activists.
"I'm so inspired by them – their priorities are exactly right," Hathaway says. "They are focused and doing all the things we tell young people to do. So I don't understand people's negative reaction to this generation, except to say they must be very comfortable with the greed innate in the status quo."

Texto completo: Anne Hathaway didn't have to dig deep for her latest role in "Dark Waters."
In Todd Haynes' whistleblower drama (now playing in select theaters, expanding nationwide Friday), the Oscar winner plays the real-life Sarah Bilott, whose husband, lawyer Rob Bilott (Mark Ruffalo), helped expose decades of environmental contamination by chemical company DuPont.
"It's heartbreaking and infuriating on a human level," Hathaway says. "There wasn't really any acting required, in terms of playing someone who was learning of (corruption) and was equal parts aghast and terrified and angry and emotional."

"I try not to blame myself too hard in those circumstances, because I believe that we as human beings and as Americans should never be put in that position where we're just trying to do our best, and we're inadvertently poisoning ourselves and the people we love."
Hathaway has always had an activist spirit, which is part of the reason why Haynes thought of her to play Sarah.
"Anne has this incredible vitality and intelligence and compassion, and you see that in her work," says the director, best known for the Oscar-nominated "Carol" and "Far from Heaven." "Sarah is an essential part of the story of Rob and how he was able to do what he did, but also how hard it is on a domestic relationship when somebody takes on the system."
A vocal member of the Time's Up movement against sexual harassment and workplace discrimination, Hathaway credits her activism to her parents, who instilled the importance of equality and inclusivity from an early age.
"I was born in the early '80s, and there were still things I was told I couldn't do because I was a girl," Hathaway says. "I was really lucky I was raised in a household where that sentence was never uttered. It seems strange to me that anybody would try to put me in a box based on the way I was born, when it's so much easier to just accept other people for how they are. So I guess that was my first awareness that the world wasn't a fair place for everyone."
The actress says she is grateful for her "Dark Waters" co-star Ruffalo, who has long spoken out about climate change and fracking. She also feels encouraged by the work of 16-year-old Greta Thunberg and other young environmental activists.
"I'm so inspired by them – their priorities are exactly right," Hathaway says. "They are focused and doing all the things we tell young people to do. So I don't understand people's negative reaction to this generation, except to say they must be very comfortable with the greed innate in the status quo."

Texto completo: A video shows the boy in severe distress. He was discovered by his cellmate, not immigration officials, as they originally claimed.
Carlos Gregorio Hernandez Vasquez collapsed onto the concrete floor of his Border Patrol holding cell early one morning in May. He lay still, next to a toilet in his sweatshirt and jeans for four hours before his cellmate woke up and found him dead.
Mr. Hernandez Vasquez, a 16-year-old from Guatemala, had arrived in the United States six days earlier. At a federal processing center in McAllen, Texas, a nurse practitioner determined he had a 103-degree fever and the flu, and recommended that he be re-evaluated and hospitalized if his condition worsened. Instead he was left in his cell.
The account of a young man's life cut short -- obtained first by ProPublica through public records -- appears to contradict the government's assurances about how Mr. Hernandez Vasquez was cared for. And it raises bigger questions about improvements federal authorities claim to have made to the health care provided to migrants in custody.
Following Mr. Hernandez Vasquez's death, a news release stated that he was discovered by federal agents during a welfare check. But a video recording provided by the Police Department in Weslaco, Texas, which initially investigated the case, shows that his death was flagged by his cellmate. Customs and Border Protection officials have not explained why the recording -- in which the teenager vomits blood on the floor, his body crumpling and squirming in apparent distress -- has a four-hour gap or why the nurse practitioner's advice was ignored.
In the last year, tens of millions of dollars have been poured into providing better care for sick migrants in federal custody, but problems persist. Mr. Hernandez Vasquez is the sixth migrant under 18 to have died in federal custody since President Trump took office. Though migrant children have crossed the southwestern border in large numbers during the past decade, none had died in federal custody until last year.
A spokesman for Customs and Border Protection who asked not to be named said in a statement that the investigation into Mr. Hernandez's death was proceeding, but did not comment on the specifics of the case. In the last year the number of medical practitioners along the southwestern border has increased more than tenfold, to 250 from 20, the statement said, and it noted that most of the agency's facilities that process large numbers of migrants have medical support available 24 hours a day.
An examination by The New York Times this year found that most of the Border Patrol's facilities along the border did not have sufficient staffing or protocols to assess the health of migrants, and that years of warnings from both inside and outside the government had largely been ignored.
The agency has historically seen its primary mission as law enforcement, but a record number of migrant families, many with young children, have created a new set of demands for caretaking.
The agency has argued that it has been overwhelmed by the large numbers, and has had no choice but to hold detainees for much longer than the 72-hour stays the facilities are designed for because it does not have enough workers to process all the newcomers.
Mr. Hernandez Vasquez entered the United States during the busiest month on record, when more than 144,116 people attempted to cross the border without authorization.
Migrants are often sick or injured when they reach the American border -- a problem that is exacerbated twice a year, by flu season in the colder months and by scorching heat in the summer. Many have walked for days or weeks by the time they arrive and are severely dehydrated and malnourished. Some traverse rocky terrain, scale walls and cross through coursing rivers full of debris.
Shelter workers who receive migrants after they are processed by federal authorities say the care the migrants appear to have received is so minimal that they often have to be sent immediately to a hospital.
Another migrant boy, Felipe Gómez Alonzo, 8, was also on his sixth day of detention in a Texas border facility and also had a 103-degree fever. He was taken to a hospital but discharged several hours later and returned to a holding cell at a Border Patrol highway checkpoint in December 2018. His condition worsened, and he died.
His death, along with that of Jakelin Caal Maquin, 7, a migrant girl who died three weeks earlier, touched off an angry backlash from the public and lawmakers, who held hearings demanding answers.
The Coast Guard and federal Public Health Service sent temporary medical help to border facilities in response. And an agencywide evaluation that followed led the Department of Homeland Security to introduce new policies requiring Border Patrol agents to conduct more thorough interviews of incoming migrants. The department also announced a $ 47 million contract for migrant medical care.
The pressure on Border Patrol agents in recent months has waned because of new, more restrictive policies that have effectively blocked many migrants from entering the United States to request asylum. Apprehensions have dropped by nearly 100,000 since Mr. Hernandez Vasquez entered the country, to 45,250 in October, the most recent month available.
Records provided by the Weslaco Police Department detail what investigators learned after local paramedics were called in response to Mr. Hernandez Vasquez's death.
When the teenager arrived on May 13, his incoming medical screening from immigration authorities said he was healthy, calm and alert. No concerns were raised about his health.
He began waiting to be placed in a children's shelter overseen by the Health and Human Services department. The facilities are designed to house young migrants for weeks or months until they can be released into the care of a family member or other sponsor, but the system was backed up in May, causing delays in placement.
Three days into his wait, according to the records, an agent helped Mr. Hernandez Vasquez contact a friend or family member by phone. A shelter placement was identified on May 19, the records show, but by then Mr. Hernandez Vasquez was beginning to show signs of illness.
An emergency medical treatment report shows he was given Tylenol after a fever diagnosis. The nurse practitioner requested that he be evaluated again in two hours, if not sooner, and that if his condition worsened, he be sent to an emergency room. The second evaluation never happened. He got his last hot meal just after midnight.
In the hours before he died, Mr. Hernandez Vasquez could have been seen through a window in his cell as he collapsed onto a concrete bench and later onto the floor, where Mylar blankets, crackers and brightly colored juice bottles lay scattered. Four welfare checks were documented during that time, but the abridged video recording does not show anyone going into or out of his cell, and Mr. Hernandez Vasquez does not appear to move during the unexplained four-hour gap in the recording.
After he was discovered by his cellmate, a physician assistant performed a single chest compression, according to the report, but stopped when blood started to pour out of his ear and his arms stiffened, showing signs of rigor mortis. He had no pulse.
Investigators found a pool of blood around his head, though he did not appear to have cut himself. The trash can next to him contained a half-eaten sandwich and two unopened frozen burritos.
The Department of Homeland Security's inspector general is looking into the young man's death.
Joel Rivera, Weslaco's police chief, said the department closed its inquiry after it established there had been no foul play. He said the four-hour gap in the video was not explained by Customs and Border Protection officials.
"What we've released is what we've got," he said.
Mitchell Ferman contributed reporting.

Texto completo: More than a half-a-million people are set to be thrown off food stamps after the Trump administration on Wednesday approved a new requirement tightening the criteria to qualify for the public assistance program.
The law would ask states to mandate certain work requirements for people seeking to qualify for the benefits in areas deemed in "economic distress." The rule would apply to only able-bodied adults without dependents.
It is expected to cut the number of people who receive food stamps by more than 600,000 nationwide.
The rule change is expected to save the federal government more than $5 billion, according to the New York Times.
“Government can be a powerful force for good, but government dependency has never been the American dream,” Sonny Perdue, the Department of Agriculture secretary, told the Times. “We need to encourage people by giving them a helping hand but not allowing it to become an indefinitely giving hand.”
The new rule is set to go into effect in April.

Texto completo: Attorney General William Barr disagrees with the Justice Department inspector general's conclusion that the FBI had enough evidence to launch an investigation into the Trump campaign in 2016.
Barr has told colleagues that he is not convinced by the evidence that Inspector General Michael Horowitz compiled suggesting that the FBI’s investigation into alleged Russian collusion by the Trump campaign launched on reasonable foundations, according to the Washington Post.
"[Horowitz's] excellent work has uncovered significant information that the American people will soon be able to read for themselves. Rather than speculating, people should read the report for themselves next week, watch the Inspector General's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and draw their own conclusions about these important matters," Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said in a statement.
Barr may make his disagreement known either through a public announcement or in a separate response included in the final draft of the report.
Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina has played down the disagreement between Barr and Horowitz. Graham, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, appeared on Fox News on Monday and accused the Washington Post and the New York Times of attempting to "diminish" the upcoming Horowitz report.
"I can tell you without any hesitation Attorney General Barr has every confidence in the world in Mr. Horowitz," Graham said. "He believes that he has done a good job, a professional job, and he appreciates the work and the effort he has put into disclosing abuse at the Department of Justice."

Daily Mail's Online Reinvention Relieves Pressure Amid Newspaper-Industry Woes; British paper's web edition, known for photo-heavy stories about vacationing celebrities and other tabloid fodder, has become one of the world's most-read news sites

Texto completo: The Daily Mail's transformation from a tabloid little known outside the U.K. to one of the world's most-read news websites is playing a key role in helping its parent company weather the downturn affecting newspapers world-wide.
The site's potent mix of web aggregation and original celebrity, scandal and breaking-news reporting has long proved popular with readers and is beginning to show its impact on the balance sheet of its corporate parent, Daily Mail and General Trust PLC.
On Thursday, the company reported that revenue from its digital arm—known in the U.S. as DailyMail.com and in the U.K. as MailOnline—grew by 15% to £140 million ($183.5 million) in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30.
The site is now "solidly profitable," DMGT Chief Executive Paul Zwillenberg said in an interview. A person familiar with the matter said the site's profit margin was greater than 10% for the year.
The website's revenue growth is notable because it is almost entirely driven by digital advertising, an area in which it has become increasingly difficult for many publishers to compete as big tech companies like Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Facebook have grown to control close to 60% of all digital ad spending.
Many big news outlets have sought to diversify their online revenue streams through subscription, events and affiliate sales businesses. The Mail has mainly stuck to its core model of boosting ad impressions by bringing in a large number of regular readers.
"It doesn't matter if you are going the subscription route or the free way like us, or a hybrid of the two—it won't work unless you have a substantial, committed audience willing to pay with their money or their time," Mr. Zwillenberg said.
The company has also built up a small e-commerce operation selling clothes featured in celebrity photos published on the sites.
He said about 70% of DailyMail.com's traffic comes directly to its home page or through its mobile app, a high number in a market where many sites rely on readers coming to stories through web searches, external links and social media.
"We have focused on building this great audience of really engaged users who come back to our home page and app day in and day out. We didn't chase the shiny things of [search engine optimization] or social or building studios," Mr. Zwillenberg said.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
Do you read the Daily Mail? What do you think about it? Join the conversation below.
Launched in the U.K. in 2008, the site expanded to the U.S. in 2010 and has since become one of the largest online news destinations in the world. In October, it attracted around 218 million global unique visitors, according to the company's internal traffic figures. In the U.S., the site drew in 85 million uniques that month, up 27% compared with the same month a year earlier, and putting it on par with the New York Times, according to Comscore Inc.
The site is well known for publishing photos of bikini-clad celebrities and delving deep into scandals involving notable figures. It has broken some consequential stories, such as revealing Anthony Weiner's online relationship with a teenager in 2016. Mr. Weiner ended up in jail, and the scandal prompted the FBI to reopen an investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails.
The site has often skirted the edge of controversy. In 2016, the Daily Mail settled a defamation lawsuit with first lady Melania Trump for $2.9 million after publishing a story claiming she had once worked as a high-end escort.
In October, former U.S. Rep. Katie Hill sent a cease-and-desist letter to the site demanding it take down nude photos it published of her related to a sex scandal that led to her resignation . A spokesman for the company declined to comment.
The site employs more than 500 reporters in offices in London, Los Angeles, New York and Sydney, churning out an average of 1,700 stories, 14,000 photos and 900 videos every day. While content from the Daily Mail newspaper does appear online, the website operates as a separate business with its own reporters.
The Daily Mail newspaper is the second-largest by circulation in the U.K., just behind the Sun, which is owned by News Corp, the parent company of The Wall Street Journal. Like all newspapers, revenue from the print edition of the Mail has been steadily declining over the past decade as readers and advertisers have moved online.
Revenue from the print operation has fallen 25% since 2014 to £406 million. At the same time, online revenue has more than doubled to £140 million. In fiscal 2019, revenue from the web accounted for 25% of the Daily Mail's revenue overall. For the year, DMGT reported adjusted operating profit for its media unit of £67 million.
On Thursday, DGMT said for the fiscal year, it recorded revenue of £1.41 billion and a pretax profit of £145 million.
While advertising revenue at the paper fell 8% year over year, it grew 12% on the Web, and advertising revenue from DailyMail.com and its related DailyMailTV operation accounted for 57% of the newspaper business' total ad revenue.
"While many others have been forced to pivot out of desperation, I'm pleased to say that the only pivot we have made in the last decade is a pivot to profit," Mr. Zwillenberg said.

Re "An Oxygen Bar Offers a Respite From Toxic Air in India" (news article, Nov. 16):
Fifteen minutes of clear air is no solution at all to the awful problem of air pollution in India or anywhere else. The toxic particles and chemicals that are inhaled from the air in polluted cities won't be washed out by a brief hit of pure oxygen, and understandably concerned and desperate citizens shouldn't be misled into thinking otherwise.
Eighty percent of people living in urban areas breathe air that is worse than World Health Organization standards, and air pollution is the leading environmental threat to health around the globe.
Seven million people each year die from breathing polluted air. Citizens everywhere deserve transparency about air quality where they live.
Only concerted action to reduce emissions through the use of cleaner fuels, promulgation and enforcement of tighter regulations, and cooperation on a global level will solve this problem.

Texto completo: Baltimore Magazine has joined The New York Times, the New York Post and other publications in recognizing Lancaster as a unique "and surprisingly hip" town.
The article, posted to Baltimore Magazine's website follows up its "surprisingly hip" comment with a quick beginner's guide on Lancaster history (and correct pronunciation).
"Surprising because, well, it’s just so dang old. Lancaster—one of the oldest inland cities in the United States—was settled in 1709 by German immigrants known as the Pennsylvania Dutch. It officially became Lancaster 20 years later, when a British citizen named it after his hometown in England. (Locally, Lancaster is pronounced “lank-iss-tr” not “lan-kast-r.”) It even served as the nation’s capital for exactly one day during the Revolutionary War—September 27, 1777," wrote Janelle Erlichman Diamond for Baltimore Magazine.
The article goes on to highlight the unique aspects of Lancaster's balance between traditional and trendy.
"That seems to be what Lancaster has done so well—hold on to tradition (Mennonite men in their straw hats and beards selling butchered meats) while embracing innovation and the future (countless boutiques and a restaurant scene The New York Times called “a global feast in an unlikely spot.”)," says Baltimore Magazine.
The article names a few favorite restaurants, bars, shops and other establishments including Max's Eatery, Thistle Finch Distillery, Passenger Coffee, Decades and others. Businesses such as Clair Brothers and the Lancaster Science Factory where also highlighted.
Yuletide at Wheatland was also singled out as something to check out during the holiday season.
The Baltimore Magazine writer sees a bit of a sister city in Lancaster in terms of quirkiness, history and trendiness.
"But no matter the season, it’s easy to fall in love with Lancaster—and not just because of the whoopie pies. It’s a town that seems to have a kinship with Baltimore: lots of history, quirkiness, independent shops, great restaurants, love of markets. It’s the kind of place you leave and then immediately start planning your next trip to. In fact, we’ve already been back twice," Diamond wrote.
Here are some other suggestions for people planning on visiting Lancaster County. And of course, we recommend checking out Visit Lancaster.

'Box-office gold': The Trump show takes London by storm

Texto completo: There may have been 29 NATO leaders in London, but there was only one star of the show.
President Trump turned three meetings with world leaders into solo news conferences on Tuesday as he answered questions on everything from impeachment, which he called “unpatriotic of Democrats,” French President Emmanuel Macron’s recent criticism of “brain-dead” NATO, which he referred to as a “nasty, nasty” statement, and the Jeffrey Epstein-related sex scandal engulfing Prince Andrew, which he described as a “very tough” story.
The result was wall-to-wall headlines across British media, where the likes of German Chancellor Angela Merkel were only an afterthought.
If the White House plan was to present a president hard at work on the international stage while Democrats press on with impeachment, then it may have worked. But it is difficult to know how much NATO work was done when each meeting became a one-man show.
Where other leaders might take questions for five minutes at the start or end of each “bilateral,” Trump spent 52 minutes, 39 minutes, and 30 minutes alongside first NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, Macron, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, respectively, according to a Reuters tally.
Stoltenberg was a bystander at his own event as Trump was asked about the prospects of his friend British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in next week’s election.
“I have no thoughts on it,” he said, before saying Johnson is a capable leader. “It’s going to be a very important election for this great country. But I have no thoughts on it,” he said.
His promise that he has no interest in trying to buy up the country’s health service led British news websites.
“If you handed it to us on a silver platter, we want nothing to do with it,” he said.
The tabloids led with his words of praise for the heroes of London Bridge, who tackled a knife-wielding terrorist armed with a narwhal tusk and whatever else came to hand.
"I was very proud of those people who grabbed him and did such a good job between the fire extinguishers and whatever else, it was an amazing job they did," he said.
British journalists seemed to enjoy the spectacle, marveling at the way he even took questions from the “failing” New York Times or Jeff Bezos’s “Amazon Washington Post.”
“Mr. Trump is box-office gold, firing insults with cheery aplomb,” wrote Quentin Letts, political sketch writer for the London Times. “What made it all the more magnificent was that this was him on best behavior.”
The Conservative Party is desperate for Trump to avoid delivering bombshells ahead of next week’s election. And he largely succeeded in stopping himself.
But, sitting alongside Trudeau, he returned to a favorite domestic theme, dismissing House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff as "a maniac" and a "deranged human being."
A British diplomatic source said he had seen plenty of American leaders in action, and none commanded attention like Trump.
“Obama knew he had authority. He had all the power but was clearly wary of being the loud Yank in the room,” he said. “Donald Trump has, shall we say, a different approach.”
Only Macron tried to parry the flow of words, making clear that he disagreed with Trump on Turkey's intervention in Syria.
When Trump tried to joke about France taking back its citizens captured in the region — “Would you like some nice ISIS fighters? I can give them to you” — Macron responded.
“Let’s be serious,” he snapped back. “The very large number of fighters you have on the ground are ISIS fighters coming from Syria, from Iraq, and the region.”
“This is why he’s a great politician, because that was one of the greatest nonanswers I’ve ever heard,” Trump said, to Macron’s clear irritation.
Things could have been worse. At the start of the day, Trump threatened a diplomatic row with Macron. He condemned the way the French president called NATO “brain dead” in the wake of Turkey’s incursion into Syria, and the two skirmished verbally over Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s role in the region.
And the day had one last act.
NATO leaders rounded off Tuesday’s meetings with a reception at Buckingham Palace followed by a second soiree, hosted by Johnson at No. 10 Downing St.
When the president’s armored car rolled into Downing Street, it carried not one leader but three.
Along with Italian Prime Minster Giuseppe Conte, Macron emerged from the president’s limousine.

Guardias de Rikers observaron por minutos a un preso intentar suicidarse, sin intervenir

Texto completo: Cuatro guardias de la prisión Rikers, la más grande de NYC, fueron suspendidos por supuestamente esperar varios minutos para rescatar a un recluso que estaba intentando ahorcarse en una celda de castigo, dijeron las autoridades policiales.
Los guardias son tres oficiales de corrección y un capitán. Fueron acusados ​​de inacción durante el incidente casi fatal cuando un joven de 18 años intentó ahorcarse en el “Centro George R. Vierno”, alrededor de la medianoche del 28 de noviembre.
El recluso, identificado por The New York Times como Nicholas Feliciano, fue puesto en un respirador y estaba en estado crítico el martes.
El capitán había presenciado el incidente en imágenes de vigilancia y acudió hasta el interno para detenerlo, dijeron las fuentes.
“Las afirmaciones que se hacen aquí son extremadamente preocupantes y las estamos tomando en serio”, dijo la comisionada del Departamento de Corrección (DOC), Cynthia Brann, en un comunicado. “Tres oficiales y un capitán ya han sido suspendidos y, si el resultado de la investigación lo amerita, tomaremos las medidas disciplinarias apropiadas hasta el despido”, agregó.
Los registros de la cárcel muestran que Feliciano fue arrestado el 19 de noviembre por violar la libertad condicional. El día del intento de suicidio había estado en un altercado y fue trasladado a una celda de detención.
El video del intento de suicidio descrito por The New York Times lo muestran envolviendo un extremo de una prenda de vestir alrededor de su cuello y otro a una tubería en el techo de la celda. Luego se bajó de una pared que separa el inodoro y se colgó de su cuello.
En un momento durante el intento suicida, Feliciano pareció tener dudas y luchó para volver a ponerse de pie en la pared. Estuvo colgado de la tubería durante unos siete minutos antes de ser rescatado.
El espantoso incidente se produce cuando el Concejo Municipal aprobó un plan en octubre para cerrar la cárcel asediada y reemplazarla por cuatro prisiones más pequeñas en distritos separados para 2026.
En un esfuerzo por mantener a los delincuentes en espera de juicio fuera de la cárcel, el estado Nueva York también aprobó una polémica ley de reforma de la fianza que entrará en vigencia en 2020 para delitos menores y graves.

Texto completo: Charlotte Nebres está haciendo historia como la primera bailarina negra seleccionada para protagonizar “El Cascanueces”, clásico navideño del New York City Ballet (NYCB).
Esa compañía artística ha presentado anualmente esta producción desde 1954 , pero en esos 65 años nunca había tenido una niña negra como protagonista.
Nebres tiene 11 años y es estudiante de “School of American Ballet”, en el Lincoln Center. La familia de su madre es de Trinidad & Tobago, y la de su padre es de Filipinas.
La pequeña dijo a The New York Times que recuerda haberse inspirado Misty Copeland, la primera directora afroamericana en el American Ballet Theatre.
Nebres está escoltada por un grupo diverso de jóvenes bailarines internacionales: el Príncipe de Nebres, Tanner Quirk, tiene raíces chinas. Sophia Thomopoulos, quien también interpreta el rol principal, es mitad coreana, mitad griega. Y el Príncipe de Sophia es interpretado por Kai Misra-Stone, quien tiene origen asiático.
“El Cascanueces” es un cuento de hadas sobre los sueños de una niña la noche de Navidad. Se estrenó por primera vez en Rusia en 1892, con música compuesta por Chaikovski.
Hoy en día es considerado un clásico navideño en todo el mundo y, según el país, la niña protagonista se llama María, Marie o Clara.
Charlotte Nebres is the first black Marie, the young heroine of “George Balanchine’s The Nutcracker,” at New York City Ballet. "There might be a little boy or girl in the audience seeing that and saying, hey, I can do that, too." https://t.co/JoNcYQF3Po

I feel like I can do anything when I dance. It makes me happy, and I’m going to do what makes me happy.

Bloomberg's Views on Marijuana Out of Step With Democratic Field; Former mayor has called legalization 'perhaps the stupidest thing anybody has ever done'

Texto completo: Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's presidential campaign is in the midst of a week focused on criminal justice and gun safety that could also spotlight an area in which his views are more conservative than the rest of the Democratic field: marijuana policy.
Mr. Bloomberg supports decriminalization of low-level marijuana-possession offenses. But he hasn't backed legalizing recreational or medical marijuana, a central part of the criminal-justice plans proposed by most other Democratic candidates that has been getting attention on the campaign trail in recent weeks.
While his campaign hasn't spelled out the details, decriminalization could involve reducing penalties for some low-level drug offenses that could still attract fines, while legalization removes legal prohibitions against marijuana for recreational use.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
How do you think Mr. Bloomberg's stance on marijuana will play among the Democratic base? Why? Join the conversation below.
"He believes no one should have their life ruined by getting arrested for possession, and, as a part of his reform efforts that drove incarceration down by 40%, he worked to get New York State laws changed to end low-level possession arrests," said spokesman Marc LaVorgna. "He believes in decriminalization and doesn't believe the federal government should interfere with states that have already legalized."
Mr. Bloomberg's campaign released an initial proposal Tuesday focused on reducing youth incarceration and helping formerly incarcerated individuals re-enter society. A more comprehensive plan detailing his marijuana policy is expected to be released soon.
During Mr. Bloomberg's mayoral tenure, marijuana-related arrests in New York City jumped. From 2002 to 2012, the New York Police Department made about 440,000 arrests for cannabis possession alone, while collectively spending about 1 million hours processing those cases, according to a report from the Drug Policy Alliance. Overall, marijuana arrests under Mr. Bloomberg exceeded those under the previous three mayors combined.
"Is he willing to undo the damage he did in New York City?" asked criminal-justice activist DeRay McKesson, who added that he would use this as the criterion for judging Mr. Bloomberg's policy proposals on the subject.
Mr. Bloomberg has already apologized , ahead of launching his White House bid , for a controversial policing practice known as "stop and frisk," which a federal judge in 2013 ruled violated the constitutional rights of minorities. He again said he was "wrong" on the policy during a roundtable discussion Tuesday in Jackson, Miss., on criminal justice—a topic that his presidential campaign has said it would focus on this week along with gun safety. The campaign aims to highlight his advocacy for gun-control measures like universal background checks.
"I made a mistake," Mr. Bloomberg said in Jackson on Tuesday. "I was wrong. I regret it, but I can't undo history. But what I can do is continue to work as hard as I can to make sure we stop all of the murders and shootings. I've taken on the [National Rifle Association] very successfully I think."
Mr. Bloomberg's view on decriminalizing marijuana has also evolved. In 2002, as mayor, Mr. Bloomberg told the New York Times that he was "a believer that we should enforce the laws," adding that he didn't think "decriminalizing marijuana is a good idea.'' By 2012, however, he came out in support of a proposal to decriminalize open possession of small amounts of the drug.
But the former mayor's position on marijuana remains to the right of most of his party. About 78% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they supported legalizing marijuana, according to a poll released by the Pew Research Center last month.
Mr. Bloomberg was critical in 2015 after Colorado voted to legalize marijuana. "What are we going to say in 10 years when we see all these kids whose IQs are 5 and 10 points lower than they would have been?" he asked, according to the Associated Press. "This is one of the stupider things that's happening across our country."
In a speech in January this year at the Naval Academy, Mr. Bloomberg called legalizing marijuana "perhaps the stupidest thing anybody has ever done."
Former Vice President Joe Biden, who has been criticized by liberals in recent weeks for being the only top Democratic candidate not to back full legalization, supports medical marijuana and expunging records of prior convictions.
In 2013, Mr. Bloomberg called medical marijuana "one of the greatest hoaxes of all time." "Medical, my foot," he said on a radio show at the time.
In the last Democratic debate in Atlanta in November, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker criticized Mr. Biden for saying he doesn't support fully legalizing marijuana use. "I thought you might have been high when you said it," Mr. Booker said.
Mr. Biden responded: "I do think it makes sense, based on data, that we should study what the long-term effects are for the use of marijuana."
Before California Sen. Kamala Harris dropped out of the race Tuesday, advocates of liberalizing marijuana laws had also criticized her record as a prosecutor, saying she didn't do enough to make the state's laws more progressive.
Mr. Bloomberg has also characterized some drug concerns as having been formerly considered "minority problems." "The suicide rate for white, high-school educated women in the Midwest—it is off the charts," he said at the SALT conference in 2016. "And the other number is the percentage of white, high-school educated men in Middle America that are using heroin—once again off the charts. Things that we used to say were minority problems. The middle-class Americans are being left out."
Mr. Bloomberg's strategy to win the Democratic nomination runs through "Super Tuesday" states , which are to vote March 3. Many of these states have large black populations, which have been disproportionately affected by drug-enforcement laws. Black people are about five times more likely to be imprisoned for drug possession than white people, according to a 2017 report from the National Registry for Exonerations at the University of California-Irvine.
He has also spoken favorably of harsh drug-related punishments in other countries, while clarifying he doesn't support them for the U.S.
"In lots of places in the Far East, they have signs up, 'Death to drug dealers,' " he said in 2012 after a trip to Asia. "Think about the number of people who die from drug use here in this country. And yet we don't take it seriously enough to dissuade people."

Texto completo: Journalist and author Abigail Pogrebin has joined the presidential campaign of Michael Bloomberg as director of Jewish outreach.
Pogrebin confirmed the hiring, first reported by The New York Jewish Week, by posting a link to the newspaper's article on Twitter.
"I've eschewed politics till now. But the stakes are too high, the country is too fractured, and we know there's a path forward to a saner, smarter day," she tweeted.
Pogrebin is the author most recently of "My Jewish Year: 18 Holidays; One Wondering Jew," and of the 2005 book "Stars of David: Prominent Jews Talk about Being Jewish."
She hosts a podcast for Tablet magazine called "Parsha in Progress" in which she discusses the Torah portion of the week with an Orthodox rabbi, Dov Linzer, president of Yeshivat Chovevei Torah.
Last year, Pogrebin completed a term as president of Central Synagogue, a prominent Reform congregation, in Manhattan.
She is the daughter of author and activist Letty Cottin Pogrebin and Bert Pogrebin, and the identical twin sister of New York Times journalist Robin Pogrebin.

Only a wiseacre would question Biden's appeal to nostalgia [Corrected 12/07/2019]

Texto completo: I like the word malarkey, consarn it. It's the bee's knees. Sure, the youngsters might say, "OK, boomer" on hearing Joe Biden utter the word, but if you think he's all wet for using it, you can take your phonus bolonus and tell it to Sweeney.
Biden has never really been my cup of tea. There's always seemed to be a bit of flimflam behind that gigglemug of his. And for a guy who uses the word malarkey more than any politician since the 19th century -- and has now emblazoned the slogan "no malarkey" on his campaign bus -- he's peddled a lot of it over the years. But he remains popular among a lot of Democrats for the same reason people like the word malarkey: nostalgia, which can be a powerful force in an election.
While I'm prone to nostalgia myself, I'm fairly immune to Biden nostalgia. So are the hep cats of Twitter and Instagram, who have an outsized role in the Democratic primary process. Most of the Twitterati weren't even twinkles in their father's eye when Biden first ran for the Senate, and it's no surprise they don't get his appeal.
But if Donald Trump taught us anything, it should be that the opinions of smarty pants don't amount to a hill of beans compared with the opinions of voters. Trump's "Make America Great Again" campaign was soaked with balderdash. He promised to balance the budget, cut taxes, spend wildly and save money in the process. He promised to fix the economy by putting China in its place and bringing back manufacturing. For nostalgic Republican voters, though, Trump's vision evoked just the sort of mythical past they aspired to inhabit one day. And it was a plus that Trump caused the self-righteous press to huff and puff their outrage as they declared him incapable of victory.
Biden benefits from a similar dynamic. The handicappers keep fitting him for a pine overcoat, but the voters haven't gotten the memo.
As Bloomberg columnist Ramesh Ponnuru writes, "The only thing Joe Biden has had going for him in this race is Democratic primary voters." Biden has flubbed debates and failed to convince wealthy members of his party to open their wallets. But despite a barrage of negative press, he remains popular with a lot of voters, particularly older ones.
Nostalgia is Biden's trump card. For some voters, it's not nostalgia for the good old days of the 1950s or the 1920s but for the Obama years -- which is why Biden mentions Obama like a verbal punctuation mark. But the former vice president also appeals to a deeper nostalgia.
For moderate voters who think things have gone haywire under Trump, Biden represents a kind of return to normalcy, to a time when partisan politics weren't quite as lethal. He may be as prone to malapropisms and misstatements as Trump, but his folksy fumbling is a known quantity, a relic from a more predictable time.
Biden is also reassuring to Democratic voters who still think they're good liberals in the tradition of FDR, LBJ and Clinton, and who honestly think their party is veering off the rails. They're the voters who aren't interested in who's tweeting what or what's trending in search engines, and there are a lot of them. A recent pre-obituary of the Kamala Harris campaign in the New York Times noted that many of the younger members of her team thought Twitter was the best place to figure out what voters really care about.
This doesn't mean everything is copacetic for Biden. But he's doing better than the wiseacres seem to think. He's up 11 points over the field nationally, nine in Nevada and 19 in South Carolina. In New Hampshire and Iowa he's slipped considerably and is now running in fourth place. But it's still easy to imagine he could win in those states or pull off a close second. Bill Clinton came in second in New Hampshire in 1992 and, thanks to his gift for tooting his own horn, was dubbed "The Comeback Kid."
If Hoosier moppet Pete Buttigieg wins in Iowa and Sen. Elizabeth Warren wins in New Hampshire as a "favorite daughter" from neighboring Massachusetts, that wouldn't be ideal for Biden. But if he were to come in second in both places, which doesn't seem unlikely, he could still be rolling in clover, and that's no malarkey.

President Trump’s reversal on vaping the right call for public health

Texto completo: Annie Karni, Maggie Haberman, and Sheila Kaplan of the New York Times describe US president Donald Trump’s proposed ban on flavored e-cigarette products as “a swift and bold reaction to a growing public health crisis affecting teenagers” that Trump backed away from “under pressure from his political advisers and lobbyists to factor in the potential pushback from his supporters.”
Maybe they’re right about Trump’s motivations, but they’re wrong about pretty much everything else.
E-cigarettes are not a “public health crisis.” That supposed crisis is not “growing.” And to the extent that teenagers are negatively affected by e-cigarettes, the very “bold reactions” the three writers seem to favor are far more culpable than e-cigarettes themselves.
E-cigarettes are, according to all credible evidence, safer than burning sticks of tobacco — sorry, FDA, you don’t get to tell me I can’t say so.
A few cases of lung injury from black market “street vapes” have been reported, the cause (use of vitamin E in the “juice”) seems to have been identified, and that problem is already disappearing in the rear-view mirror.
Who buys “street vapes?” People who can’t buy the e-cigarette products they want legally, either because of content (cannabis) or age (the teenagers the Times authors imply they care about so much).
Banning flavored e-cigarette products wouldn’t stop teenagers, or anyone else, from getting flavored e-cigarette products. It would just send even more of them to the “street vape” market for those products.
If Trump reconsidered his proposed ban due to political pressure and the desire to be re-elected, so what? A good decision is a good decision.
President Franklin Delano Roosevelt once told a group of lobbyists, who were pushing a policy change at him, “Okay, you’ve convinced me. Now go out and bring pressure on me.”
That’s how politics works. Politicians appease voters and activist groups who can help or harm their careers. Sometimes that works out well for the public, sometimes it works out badly.
In this case it works out well — certainly for the public, and possibly for Trump. Much of the “I Vape and I Vote” demographic presumably falls outside his existing electoral “base,” and for at least some the issue matters enough to swing their votes.
Now Trump’s Democratic opponents need to decide which they value more: Their desire to run everyone’s lives at the expense of actual public health, or public health and those votes.

Texto completo: Once in the Oval Office, a demagogue can easily stay there.
Donald Trump's Republican congressional allies are throwing up different defenses against impeachment and hoping that something may sell. They say that he didn't seek a corrupt political bargain with Ukraine, but that if he did, he failed, and the mere attempt is not impeachable. Or that it is not clear that he did it, because the evidence against him is unreliable "hearsay."
It's all been very confusing. But the larger story -- the crucial constitutional story -- is not the incoherence of the president's defense. It is more that he and his party are exposing limits of impeachment as a response to the presidency of a demagogue.
The founders feared the demagogue, who figures prominently in the Federalist Papers as the politician who, possessing "perverted ambition," pursues relentless self-aggrandizement "by the confusions of their country." The last of the papers, Federalist No. 85, linked demagogy to its threat to the constitutional order -- to the "despotism" that may be expected from the "victorious demagogue." This "despotism" is achieved through systematic lying to the public, vilification of the opposition and, as James Fenimore Cooper wrote in an essay on demagogues, a claimed right to disregard "the Constitution and the laws" in pursuing what the demagogue judges to be the "interests of the people."
Should the demagogue succeed in winning the presidency, impeachment in theory provides the fail-safe protection. And yet the demagogue's political tool kit, it turns out, may be his most effective defense. It is a constitutional paradox: The very behaviors that necessitate impeachment supply the means for the demagogue to escape it.
As the self-proclaimed embodiment of the American popular will, the demagogue portrays impeachment deliberations as necessarily a threat to democracy, a facade for powerful interests arrayed against the people that only he represents. Critics and congressional opponents are traitors. Norms and standing institutional interests are fraudulent.
President Trump has made full use of the demagogic playbook. He has refused all cooperation with the House. He lies repeatedly about the facts, holds public rallies to spread these falsehoods and attacks the credibility, motives and even patriotism of witnesses. His mode of "argument" is purely assaultive. This is the crux of the Trump defense, and not an argument built on facts in support of a constitutional theory of the case.
Of course, all the presidents who have faced impeachment mounted a political defense, to go with their legal and constitutional case. And it is not unusual that they -- and, even more vociferously, their allies -- will attack the process as a means of undoing an election.
The difference in Mr. Trump's case is not merely one of degree. Richard Nixon despised his opposition, convinced of their bad faith and implacable hatred for him. But it is hard to imagine Mr. Trump choosing (and actually meaning) these words to conclude, as Nixon did, a letter to the chair of Judiciary Committee: "[If] the committee desires further information from me ... I stand ready to answer, under oath, pertinent written interrogatories, and to be interviewed under oath by you and the ranking minority member at the White House."
Mr. Trump has instead described Adam Schiff, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, as a "corrupt" politician who shares with other "human scum" the objective of running the "most unfair hearings in American history."
These remarks are not merely one more instance of Mr. Trump's failure to curb his impulses. This is his constitutional defense strategy. Mr. Trump's White House counsel, informing the House of the president's refusal to cooperate, declared that the impeachment process is unconstitutional and invalid -- a "naked political strategy" -- and advised that the president would not participate. It matters that the president's lawyer, in a formal communication with the House, used rhetoric that might have been expected from the hardest-core political supporters. Once again, contrasts with past impeachments are illuminating. Bill Clinton's White House counsel Charles Ruff testified before the House Judiciary Committee, pledging to "assist you in performing your constitutional duties."
The demagogue may be boundlessly confident in his own skills and force of political personality, but he cannot succeed on those alone. He can thrive only in political conditions conducive to the effective practice of these dark arts, such as widespread distrust of institutions, a polarized polity and a fractured media environment in which it is possible to construct alternative pictures of social realities. Weak political parties now fall quickly into line with a demagogue who can bring intense pressure to bear on party officials and officeholders through his hold on "the base." As we have seen with Mr. Trump, the demagogue can bully his party into being an instrument of his will, silencing or driving out dissenters. Republican officeholders know that Mr. Trump can take to Twitter or to Fox News or to the podium at rallies -- or all of the above -- to excoriate them for a weak will or disloyalty.
This is how the Republican Party has become Mr. Trump's party. It is also why that party will not conceive of its role in impeachment as entailing a constitutional responsibility independent of the president's political and personal interests. It has come to see those interests as indistinguishable from its own. In this way the constitutional defense of the case against Mr. Trump and the defense of his own interests become one and the same. As another fabled demagogue, Huey Long of Louisiana, famously announced: "I'm the Constitution around here now."
The implications for the constitutional impeachment process are dire. Until Mr. Trump, modern impeachment has ended with some generally positive assessment of its legacy. Nixon's resignation appeared to indicate that serious charges could bring the parties together in defense of the rule of law. "The system worked" was a popular refrain, even if this was a somewhat idealized and oversimplified version of events. The Clinton impeachment suggested that the standards for an impeachable offense required a distinction between public misconduct and private morality, and Congress reclaimed its responsibility for impeachment from an independent counsel statute that was allowed to lapse.
The Trump impeachment is headed toward a very different summation. A demagogue can claim that Congress has forfeited the right to recognition of its impeachment power, then proceed to unleash a barrage of falsehoods and personal attacks to confuse the public, cow legislators and intimidate witnesses. So long as the demagogue's party controls one of the two chambers of Congress, this strategy seems a sure bet.
When this is all over, we will not hear warm bipartisan praise for how "the system worked." The lesson will be that, in the politics of the time, a demagogue who gets into the Oval Office is hard to get out.

Texto completo: Employees from across the company have long heeded the same charitable call made to readers: Remember the neediest.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
It began with a spate of discarded books, culled from drawers and desks across the newsroom.
And it has burgeoned into an enduring tradition, which has raised more than $ 570,000 for The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
The first New York Times employee book sale, held in 1993, repurposed stray galleys and uncorrected proofs into items that colleagues could purchase at a steep discount for charitable purposes. Over the years, it has expanded to include books donated by employees, CDs, DVDs and other merchandise, ranging from beauty products to unconventional items such as a toilet and a kitchen sink.
"It served everyone," said Merrill Perlman, a longtime Times editor and Times consultant and member of the book sale committee. "It allows you to clean off your desk, it allows you to purchase books, it allows you to feel good about donating books."
Since the fund was started by the publisher Adolph S. Ochs more than 100 years ago, The Times has urged its readers to "remember the neediest" every winter by contributing to the fund's coffers. The Neediest Cases Fund has raised over $ 300 million since its creation. Money raised goes to charitable agencies throughout the city -- and beyond it.
The employee book sale has been on hiatus since 2017 because of space restrictions in The Times's Manhattan office in the wake of a vast renovation project, though it is expected to resume next summer.
Early last month, however, the Children's Book Sale -- an offshoot of the original -- had its most successful year since it started in 2010, bringing in $ 8,500.
"It raises money for Neediest at the right time of the year," said Ellen Herb, who works in the legal department and is a member of the Children's Book Sale Committee. "It gives people a chance to buy books for their kids for Christmas or holidays or just to stash in the closet for some day in the future."
The office renovation led to an unexpected boon for the fund. The reshuffling produced an excess of newsroom equipment that was either obsolete or unneeded. Alan Yacavone, who works in IT Operations, sought out a disposal vendor. He found Revivn, which has removed thousands of computers and other IT equipment -- and paid The Times for the collections.
"I was looking to save the company money," Mr. Yacavone. "I was hoping there wouldn't be any charge. But then they're sending me checks."
Mr. Yacavone has diverted that money, totaling more than $ 100,000, to -- where else? -- The Neediest Cases.
The Times's video department underwent a similar purge in October when it upgraded its equipment. Hundreds of items were put up for sale to Times employees: older-generation video cameras, batteries, lenses, lights, tripods, audio equipment and much more.
That effort raised more than $ 22,000.
"It had been some years since we had gotten new equipment at that level," said Francesca Barber, who directs operations and strategy for the Video desk. "It was a unique opportunity where we had this breadth of equipment that was really valuable."
Other Times employees have launched fund-raising efforts.
Last year, Storm Hurwitz, a senior analyst in Product Analytics, revived the company's dormant Baking Club. Members meet monthly to socialize and share desserts. Colleagues are invited to sample goodies, in exchange for a donation of their choice.
Despite varying opinions on what charitable cause to support, members of the Baking Club reached a consensus.
"Neediest Cases addresses a wide array of charities and social causes that we all felt like we could find some investment in," Mr. Hurwitz said. To date, the club has raised more than $ 1,500.
Ethan Mehas, a software engineer, cited the Baking Club as an inspiration in the formation of his own internal group a few months ago, centered on craft beer.
The most recent meet-up last month was framed as a charity tasting and bottle share. Participants could contribute their own beer for communal drinking, or make a donation to sample the brews.
"The thing we like about the Neediest Cases Fund is that it's a collection of funds," said Mr. Mehas. "We really didn't have to select one over the other. It's almost a mutual fund versus a stock."
More than 20 people attended the event, which raised $ 100. Mr. Mehas plans to enact additional fund-raising ideas at future gatherings.
Every act of generosity, from the casual to the creative, is proof that The Neediest Cases Fund is likely to remain a cause supported by Times Company employees in perpetuity, as colleagues have long heeded the same charitable call made to readers:
Remember the Neediest.

Texto completo: President Trump left a dreary Washington on Monday with some pointed words for Democrats, who, he said, are deliberately holding an impeachment hearing while he is out of the country.
WASHINGTON -- President Trump set off to London on Monday, admonishing "radical" Democrats for continuing their impeachment inquiry while he attends a NATO summit -- "one of the most important journeys that we make as president."
"It's a hoax, an absolute disgrace," Mr. Trump said of the House inquiry. Though he also predicted that the matter would end up being "a tremendous boon for the Republicans."
"Republicans have never, ever been so committed as they are right now -- and so united," Mr. Trump said. "So it's really a great thing in some ways, but in other ways it's a disgrace."
The White House has said it would not participate on Wednesday when the House Judiciary Committee questions legal experts about whether there are grounds to impeach Mr. Trump over a pressure campaign on Ukraine in an effort to influence the 2020 election.
Mr. Trump scolded Democrats for scheduling an impeachment hearing while he was out of Washington. The NATO summit was announced months ago, while the Judiciary Committee scheduled its first public impeachment hearing last week.
In London, Mr. Trump and other world leaders will commemorate NATO's 70th anniversary. Other countries in the alliance have increased their financial contributions -- something Mr. Trump has long pushed for. He campaigned on the notion that the United States should not have to bear the bulk of the costs.
The president has individual meetings scheduled with leaders, including the president of France and the chancellor of Germany. But he does not have a one-on-one meeting on the books with Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain, who is facing his own election later this month and is trying to keep Mr. Trump at a distance.
Mr. Trump was traveling with the first lady, Melania Trump, and his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, who played a key role in the Trump administration's efforts to withhold nearly $ 400 million in military aid for Ukraine in exchange for a pledge to announce investigations into Mr. Trump's political rivals.
Mr. Trump on Monday cited a recent article in which President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine repeated his assertion that a July 25 conversation at the heart of the impeachment inquiry did not involve a this-for-that negotiation.
As he left the White House, Mr. Trump said Mr. Zelensky's recent comments should be the end of the investigation.
"That should be case over," Mr. Trump said.

Texto completo: Doctors, including a medical school dean, offer suggestions for making medicine more accessible to students of lesser means.
To the Editor:
Re "'I Have a Ph.D. in Not Having Money,"' by Emma Goldberg (Science Times, Nov. 26):
This article sheds light on an important issue. American medical schools are at a crossroads, and now is the time to fix the disparity in medicine and science. Becoming a physician or scientist should not be exclusive to a certain race, gender or economic level. To provide the best patient care, our future doctors and scientists need to come from diverse backgrounds, including socioeconomic status.
It is time for medical education to take a look in the mirror: How can we best care and develop new treatments for underserved communities if they don't see doctors or scientists that reflect the community?
We must reduce student debt burden and address burnout. In tandem, we must push forward new infrastructure and solutions so that becoming a physician or scientist is more inclusive. And then, we must move beyond inclusion to providing every student, professor, physician and scientist with a sense of belonging.
Augustine M.K. Choi
New York
The writer is dean of Weill Cornell Medicine.
To the Editor:
Are we discouraging the type of doctors our country sorely needs by pricing them out of a medical degree?
It pains me to read these stories, and yet it is comes as no surprise. With the challenges students face long after their admission, how many candidates are deterred from applying in the first place?
In the end, those who may make excellent doctors will take their talents into other fields. Our patients need doctors with racial and socioeconomic diversity. We know this is something we lack, despite evidence it improves outcomes.
New York University recently made medical school tuition-free. I am not suggesting that this is the solution, but it is an effort to address the situation.
Elizabeth Kuhn
Philadelphia
The writer is a pediatric resident.
To the Editor:
While the trials and tribulations of accumulating student debt for low-income students in medical school were interesting, the most common solution to this problem was ignored.
The largest scholarship program for medical students is serving the country as a member of the United States military or Public Health Service. In exchange for committing to serve our country, students are paid a stipend, and full tuition and books are covered.
It was a great way for me to afford medical school, avoid having to fill out endless loan papers, and ultimately, practice medicine with the wide variety of Americans serving our country daily.
Kenneth Wells
Gardiner, Me.
The writer, a retired Navy flight surgeon, is a family physician.
To the Editor:
I am a retired ob-gyn and still have the ophthalmoscope/otoscope, reflex hammer, tuning forks and blood pressure cuff that I was required to buy as a first-year medical student. These immediately became redundant when I became a resident, and more so when I joined a practice. The clinics had them all in exam rooms, and hospitals had them to share.
Each medical school could provide "recyclable" sets for students provided by graduates if not by the school itself.
There must be thousands of sets of this equipment available from retired and practicing physicians. I plan to deliver mine so that an incoming student can make use of it. I hope others will do the same.
Applications, test prep materials and qualifying exams should be priced on a sliding scale, or at least with costs refundable for documented financial need.

Texto completo: PAWTUCKET, R.I. — State and city officials on Monday announced a $400 million project that would put a 7,500-seat professional soccer stadium, an indoor sports center, and a 200-room hotel on three sites in downtown Pawtucket.
Governor Gina M. Raimondo and Mayor Donald R. Grebien joined Fortuitous Partners in announcing the Tidewater Landing project, calling it the largest economic development project in the Rhode Island city's history. Officials said the project would create 2,500 direct and indirect construction jobs, plus 1,200 direct jobs once completed.
“Here, we have an opportunity of a lifetime," Grebien said.
The announcement came exactly one week after the Pawtucket Red Sox announced that the Triple-A baseball team will be known as the WooSox when it moves to Worcester for the start of the 2021 season.
“The PawSox play a valuable role in this community. We have them in our fabric, so it's a loss," Grebien said. “But when you look at the substantial development — not comparing [United Soccer League] to baseball, but the development itself — absolutely, the city is in a much better position today."
State Secretary of Commerce Stefan Pryor said the project involves seven times more private investment than a failed proposal to keep the PawSox in Rhode Island.
“The proposed set of assets that will be produced — the physical developments, the mix of uses — are far superior to what the PawSox were proposing," Pryor said. “Beyond the boundaries of this development — the proposal on these three sites — we believe there will be a catalytic effect that far exceeds what the PawSox would have yielded."
The project will require $70 million to $90 million in public investment, mostly by the state. It relies on a newly approved tax-increment financing tool and federal Opportunity Zone tax incentives, which have stirred controversy on the national level. No public votes are anticipated, and no General Assembly approval is needed.
The Tidewater site, on the west bank of the Seekonk River and west of Interstate 95, would hold a stadium for a soccer team that would compete in the United Soccer League Championship — the second tier of US professional soccer. The “placeholder" name for the team is the Riptide. The team would begin playing in 2022.
About 200 people crowded into the Blackstone Valley Tourism Center for the Tidewater Landing announcement. Students from Tolman and Shea high schools raised their hands when Raimondo asked if anyone watched soccer.
Rhode Island is in the top 10 markets for televised soccer in the United States, and soccer viewership is on the rise, she said.
“Rhode island is the best market in the country without a professional soccer team," said Brett M. Johnson, founder and partner of Fortuitous Partners and cochair of the Phoenix Rising Football Club.
Pryor said Pawtucket is where the US Open Cup, the national championship in soccer, began more than a century ago. On Lonsdale Avenue, where there's now a Price Rite store, there was Coates Field.
The soccer tournament was held there in 1913, before thousands of spectators. Pryor read from an article in the Pawtucket Times: “Every vantage point was filled with humanity. Spectators thronged seven and eight deep."
Pryor added, “I think that's the kind of excitement we're creating again. We are returning to its soccer home."
The Tidewater site, once home to a National Grid gas plant, also would include a riverside park, restaurants, and retail stores.
The Division Street site, on the east bank of the Seekonk River, would include food and beverage establishments, residences, a riverside park, and a pedestrian bridge.
Pryor said officials have been having “positive, constructive" conversations with the owners of the Apex site and hope they won't have to use eminent domain powers. “We would resort to eminent domain only as a last resort," he said.
Pryor said the state and city funds would be used to pay for infrastructure such as parking, the pedestrian bridge, and parks. He said Fortuitous Partners would finance the stadium privately.
The public funds would be derived through the tax-increment financing tool approved by the General Assembly in June. Tax revenue emanating from the new development would be used for the project, Pryor said.
Based on preliminary estimates over a 30-year financing period, the project is expected to pay for itself, Pryor said. He said tax revenue received by the state and city over those three decades could be double the public investment in the project.
The public investment of $70 million to $90 million would represent 20 percent of the project's cost, Pryor said. The state would provide $60 million to $80 million of that total.
In Washington, Democrats have questioned the Opportunity Zone program, which is meant to encourage investment in poor neighborhoods. The New York Times has reported that wealthy investors and developers, including some with ties to the Trump administration, are poised to profit from the program.
Grebien said that while there might be controversy about the program, it's helping Pawtucket.
“From the City of Pawtucket's perspective, without those types of opportunity zones and the [tax-increment financing] district legislation, we would be sitting here as we have for the last twentysomething years in Pawtucket without these types of developments," Grebien said.
Pryor said the Opportunity Zone program can be improved. But, he said, “Our mission is to utilize every tool available to us to advance the Rhode Island economy. In this particular case, we are able to bring substantial private investment to a city that deserves it — Pawtucket."
Grebien said no decision has been made about what to do with McCoy Stadium after the PawSox leave. He said the options include a Single-A baseball team, an independent league baseball team, or some municipal purpose.
Grebien said he called PawSox chairman Larry Lucchino and president Charles Steinberg to congratulate them on the WooSox announcment.
“I have had to digest that," Grebien said. “It's not where anybody wanted to be. But as we look at this, we wish them well, and we are going to move forward — in some ways, in a lot better ways."

Texto completo: It seems pretty easy for just about anyone who has dropped by Donald Trump's White House to get a lucrative book deal. Any insight into the inner workings of the Trump administration is golden, even if the person providing it only lasted a few days.
By the end of his first term, at least 20 books will have been written about Trump's political dealings, several of them by former Washington insiders, including staff members, FBI officials, politicians, advisers and journalists.
The latest former official to pen a tell-all book is John Bolton, Trump's third national security adviser in three years, whom the president pushed out after just 17 months on the job. Bolton apparently has lots of juicy tidbits to reveal in the book scheduled for release next year. And you can bet that America will be all ears.
Sadly, we are all too willing to give these former Trump enablers our undivided attention. Many of them were willing to sell their souls for a chance to promote their own agenda, and when they failed, they looked to us for sympathy.
Not long ago, some were pretending in public as though Trump was a capable world leader, all the while taking notes or recording conversations for a book that would tell the true story of his inefficacy. People who once were willing to kiss the ground Trump walks on would have us believe that they experienced some sort of epiphany once they left Washington and came to realize that yeah, Trump really is as bad as his critics say he is.
We're not that dumb. Trump told them he was a snake before they took a job in his administration. They cannot convince us now that they didn't know he was a snake.
Former House Speaker Paul Ryan, whom Trump once praised for leaving "a legacy of achievement that nobody can question," gave us "The Way Forward: Renewing the American Idea." In it, he revealed that Trump "didn't know anything about government" and operates on ill-informed "knee-jerk reactions."
Ryan was willing to cozy up to Trump for two years while he got want he wanted from him -- a presidential signature on a bill cutting taxes for the rich. Meanwhile, he indulged Trump's ridiculous demands to build a border wall and stood by as he implemented cruel policies such as eliminating protections for "Dreamers."
Omarosa Manigault Newman, Trump's former communications director for the Office of Public Liaison, gifted us with "Unhinged: An Insider's Account of the Trump White House," in which she revealed that Trump is a "racist" who has used the "N-word" repeatedly.
For months, Manigault Newman smiled for the cameras while posing with Trump at White House events geared toward African Americans, knowing that he talked about black people behind their backs and had no interest in furthering their causes.
Then we have Anthony Scaramucci, who spent 11 days as White House communications director, writing "Trump, the Blue-Collar President." In the book, published last year, he calls Trump a "genius" and said, for a "guy working in finance, who wanted to rise through the economic classes and reach for the Gold Ring, Mr. Trump was the Great Gatsby."
By the time the book came out, though, Scaramucci and his former Gatsby were feuding and he was a lot more honest, confirming what we already knew, that Trump "does intentionally lie." He also recently told The New York Times Trump is "off the rails" and that "honest people in the room know that he is crazy."
Former press secretary Sean Spicer, fired FBI Director James Comey, former White House communications director Hope Hicks, former National Security adviser H.R. McMaster and convicted presidential campaign adviser Roger Stone are among those who have profited from their association with Trump.
Most recently, we've had Anonymous, the unknown author who is giving us "A Warning." The person still works in Trump's White House, but doesn't have the guts to identify him or herself.
Anonymous claims that the administration is in such disarray that senior members of Trump's team once considered sabotaging the president to get him to resign. According to the book, people in his inner circle fear that Trump is in the pocket of Russian President Vladimir Putin, and staffers all have "draft resignation letters in our desks or on our laptops."
We should take the expose with a grain of salt. That doesn't mean, of course, that the White House isn't in chaos. But anyone who publicly criticizes their boss while still getting a paycheck cannot be trusted.
Make no mistake. This unnamed "senior official" is no whistleblower. This isn't a Deep Throat or a concerned informant who risked his or her career, and possibly their life, by reporting alleged corruption by Trump and his associates.
If anything, this is the work of a coward. Which brings us back to Bolton.
Bolton, who was part of Trump's team during the time of the events that are now central to the impeachment hearings, has refused to testify without a court order. Though his lawyer has confirmed that Bolton has information that would be useful in the probe, Bolton has chosen to hold on to it, possibly saving the juiciest details for his book.
These are desperate times in America right now. We don't need selfish people who are only out to benefit themselves. We need folks who are willing to do the right thing while they are in the White House and when they leave.
That means putting everything on the line in exchange for dignity and self-respect. Beyond putting money in the pockets of the authors, these book deals have done little or nothing to move the conversation forward or hold Trump accountable.
If anything, they are just a rehashing of what we already know about Trump -- that he is an awful president who is not fit to hold office. We should not be willing to pay for that.

Impeachment Was on the Family Table This Thanksgiving

Texto completo: Thanksgiving is over and, predictably, impeachment couldn't be kept off the table. We tried to avoid the dish, we really did. But in my family of Philadelphia-area suburbanites, the very demographic that may decide the 2020 presidential election, the hunger to see where everybody stood couldn't be denied. We are all college-educated, a few of us inclined to wokeness, some members of white-collar unions and therefore left of center, others more concerned with our stock portfolios. Only one beloved aunt was willing to declare her full support for President Trump. The rest had more or less been successfully fed the New York Times' version of events.
There was a widespread belief that the phrase quid pro quo was the name of a type of felony. Roughly the same family members believed this who last Thanksgiving had believed "collusion" was a criminal act. None except the family Trumpist had at all considered how the information they possessed had been packaged for their consumption. Four or five of us were willing to admit that the hearings were "too partisan" and unfair, though the overriding concern wasn't so much devotion to abstract justice as fear that the nation wouldn't swallow the impeachers' conclusions.
Most of my family had concluded from the little they had heard about the impeachment proceedings -- even the retirees hadn't watched more than video highlights -- that Mr. Trump had done something uniquely bad, even shocking. My family has had little direct experience with politicians. Almost everyone believed that Mr. Trump had tried to pressure the Ukrainian prime minister for his own political gain. No one had read the rough transcript of the call between the two leaders.
We discussed what crime might have been committed, and the most popular option was "extortion." No one present had studied criminal law. Almost everyone thought that Mr. Trump was unpresidential -- the epithet "jackass" elicited vigorous nods of agreement -- and should be "removed," like a gravy stain from a baby's bib, as soon as possible.
These opinions were asserted with considerable passion, leaving the family Trumpist to stew in her juices. Something approaching rational debate arose only on the question of whether impeachment would benefit the Democrats. No one thought the Democrats had a candidate who could beat Mr. Trump. No one thought the Senate would convict him. Most couldn't comprehend why the hearings so far had failed to move public opinion. The two most woke family members hoped that Mr. Trump would be damaged enough to allow a more radical Democrat to win, but this was generally dismissed as wishful thinking. The moderate Democrats in the family felt that their party's efforts would have been better spent on finding a candidate who didn't want to take away their generous private insurance. No one thought Michael Bloomberg was an appetizing alternative to the current flock of turkeys.
As for me, I had taken the precaution of bringing some decent claret to the festivities, and several of the dishes on the table merited close attention, so I managed to keep my private thoughts to myself -- a course of action I have always found to improve digestion after family feasts. Pragmatic soul that I am, when some juvenile inquisitor insists I take sides, demanding, "You're not for Trump, are you?" my standard response is "Compared to whom?" But fortunately the only Manichaean choice imposed on me was between the pecan and spicy pumpkin pie.
I was tempted to opine that if Mr. Trump were impeached and then acquitted by the Senate, he could -- and no doubt would -- claim loudly during the election to have been exonerated a second time of all wrongdoing, going 2-0 against Democratic "witch hunts." I yielded instead to the safer temptation to lob another scoop of ice cream on my pie. My other unspoken thought was that the Democrats' current impeachment tirade was payback for the Republican's dubious attempt to impeach President Clinton in 1998, and that the Republicans would undoubtedly repeat the whole useless exercise the next time they won the House during a Democratic presidency.
Only one generation of Americans experienced an impeachment proceeding between 1783 and 1973; my generation has witnessed three, and a pattern is beginning to form. One can only hope that the country will eventually learn why regular constitutional order is more productive than engineered political upheavals, or at least that what goes around, comes around. After all, what's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.

Marilyn Saviola, Advocate Of Disability Rights Efforts In New York, Dies at 74

Texto completo: Polio left her in a wheelchair. It also started her on a lifelong fight to change perceptions and break down real-world obstacles.
Marilyn E. Saviola, who after childhood polio left her a quadriplegic spent much of her adult life advocating for people with disabilities, pushing for the removal of both the physical barriers and the attitudes that hinder people like her from fully participating in society, died on Nov. 23 at her home in Brooklyn. She was 74.
Independence Care System, which supports people with disabilities and chronic conditions, and where Ms. Saviola was a senior vice president, posted news of her death on its website. The cause was not given.
Ms. Saviola joined the battle for the rights of people with disabilities back when it was still relatively new, while in college in the late 1960s. She was executive director of the advocacy group Center for the Independence of the Disabled in New York from 1983 to 1999 and then spent the next 20 years with Independence Care System, running its advocacy and women's health program.
Those roles put her in the midst of the push for obvious accommodations like curb cuts in sidewalks and less obvious ones like financing for personal aides for people who need help dressing, bathing and getting in and out of wheelchairs. Over the years her wide range of activities included blocking buses in her wheelchair in transportation-related protests and organizing a singing group for people with disabilities.
This past summer she was honored at the opening of a newly renovated radiology unit at NYC Health & Hospitals/Gotham Health in the Morrisania section of the Bronx that typifies her impact. The new unit, equipped with lifts, movable examination tables and a modified mammography machine, is designed to make it easier for women who use wheelchairs or have other disabilities to receive mammograms and obstetric and gynecological care.
"Marilyn Saviola's steadfast advocacy has ensured that the needs of the disability community are at the forefront of health care policy discussions," Victor Calise, commissioner of the New York City Mayor's Office for People With Disabilities, said at the time.
For Ms. Saviola, such services and facilities were a civil right on a par with those fought for by black people and women.
"Our goal is not to get to the front of the bus," she told The New York Times in 1997, "it is to make government pay for technology to get us on the bus."
Marilyn Elizabeth Saviola was born on July 13, 1945, in Manhattan and grew up in the Bronx. Her father, Peter, and mother, Camilla, immigrants from Italy, owned a candy store and luncheonette. But her life changed drastically in August 1955, when she became sick while visiting relatives in Connecticut.
Polio was diagnosed. The first vaccine for it had recently been developed, but she hadn't yet received it.
"I was supposed to do it when I went back to school in September," she recalled in an oral history recorded for the Disability Rights and Independent Living Movement Oral History Project in 2001.
She was taken to Willard Parker Hospital in Manhattan.
"I was in this huge room where I guess there were maybe four or five other people," she recalled, "and they would always die. Apparently I was one of the few people who ever survived in that room."
She spent time in an iron lung and, when she came out of it, had to use a respirator to breathe. She was transferred to Goldwater Memorial Hospital on Roosevelt Island, which provided long-term care for people with disabilities and chronic conditions, but eventually was sent home.
There, in her family's two-story home, with stairs to negotiate, her life became more limited as she grew larger and her parents couldn't easily lift her. In her teens, she decided to return to Goldwater to live.
"I had a lot of friends, but when you're getting to like 16 and 17, they all would go out and I would be stuck alone," she said. "So I had nothing. At least in Goldwater I had a peer group, you know, and I got out."
She began to think about her disability and why it was easier for her to live in an institution than at home. She finished high school at Goldwater -- there were tutors there -- and was accepted at Long Island University.
At first she didn't go to classes in person; she took them via a speaker phone.
"It was horrible," she said. "All I had was the work and none of the fun of going to college."
She began attending classes at the university's buildings in Brooklyn, using a motorized wheelchair. That had its challenges.
"Going to the library was a joke because it really wasn't at all accessible," she said, "nor could you get any help unless you brought an able-bodied person with you or a person whose disability was less than yours."
Yet she earned a bachelor's degree in psychology there in 1970. Two years later she received a master's degree in rehabilitation counseling at New York University.
While in college she became involved with others who were turning the activism of the period toward issues faced by people with disabilities.
"We were beginning to get much more militant about our movement," she said in the oral history. "Wanting for change to occur through the goodness of well-meaning -- this wasn't enough."
She participated in demonstrations with groups like Disabled in Action (later becoming its president), and she began to realize she wanted to leave Goldwater Memorial and live on her own. In 1973 she moved into her own apartment. She was surprised when friends and family members kept telling her how brave she was.
"The thing was that I wasn't scared," she said. "It was much scarier for me thinking about remaining the rest of my life in Goldwater than leaving the institution and living on my own."
In the ensuing decades she was a strong voice on issues including transportation, housing and education for people with disabilities. In the 2001 oral history, she noted a simple sign of progress.
"Ten, 15 years ago, if I wanted to go to a movie, the way I would go is find out what movie is playing at the theater I could get into, as opposed to what movie is it that I want to see," she said. "Now it's so much easier, because so many of the theaters are accessible."
Ms. Saviola is survived by her partner of many years, Robert Geraghty.
Although Ms. Saviola knew that in many ways the push for disability rights is still in its early stages and that the gains made by advocates like her can be undone, in a video interview with The Times in 2010 she noted one clear sign of progress, at least in New York: visibility.
"One of the greatest changes is, I'm not the only one," she said. "I'll go to an event, a concert, I'll go into a store, there are other people who are wheelchair users. That didn't happen 30 years ago."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Leaders of nations across the globe are failing to adequately address global warming, imperiling the future of their citizens, said former secretary of state John Kerry on Sunday in announcing his formation of a bipartisan coalition to push for immediate policy changes.
“There are great efforts out there; many environmental groups, young people, particularly, but no country is getting the job done," said the former senator from Massachusetts on NBC's “Meet the Press." “I mean, the simple reality is that we are way behind, way behind the eight ball. Things are getting worse, not better."
The name of the coalition, World War Zero, is supposed to evoke both the national security threat posed by the Earth's warming and the type of wartime mobilization that Kerry argued would be needed to stop the rise in carbon emissions before 2050. The star-studded group is supposed to win over those skeptical of the policies that would be needed to accomplish that.
Former presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter are part of the effort. Moderate Republican lawmakers such as Arnold Schwarzenegger, the former governor of California, and John Kasich, the former governor of Ohio, are on the list. Stars including Leonardo DiCaprio, Sting, and Ashton Kutcher round out the roster of more than 60 founding members. Their goal is to hold more than 10 million “climate conversations" in the coming year with Americans across the political spectrum.
Schwarzenegger joined Kerry on the talk show Sunday. He cited California's growing economy even with some of the strictest environmental laws in the United States.
“It just shows to you the power that we have by going green and the kind of jobs we created," Schwarzenegger said. “And I think that's what we want to do: We want the whole United States to go in that direction, the whole world to go in that direction."
With a starting budget of $500,000, Kerry said, he and other coalition members intend to hold town meetings across the country starting in January. Members will head to battleground states key to the 2020 election but also to military bases where climate discussions are rare and to economically depressed areas that members say could benefit from clean-energy jobs.
“We're going to do the things we need to do. We're going to organize. We're going to mobilize. We're going to talk to literally millions of Americans over the course of the next months and this is going to become a primary issue," said Kerry, the Democratic nominee for president in 2004.
The launch of the new group comes as diplomats gather in Madrid on Monday for global climate negotiations aimed at strengthening the 2015 Paris Agreement, from which President Trump has vowed to withdraw. Earlier this week the United Nations found that the world's richest countries, responsible for emitting more than three-fourths of planet-warming pollution, are not doing enough to keep Earth's temperature from rising to dangerously high levels. Net carbon emissions from the two largest polluters, the United States and China, are expanding.
Kerry said that although individual members might personally promote specific climate policy proposals, like a tax on carbon dioxide pollution, or the Green New Deal, the coalition is not aimed at promoting any particular plan.
“We're not going to be divided going down a rabbit hole for one plan or another," he told The New York Times.

On Mars, Rover Reported An Atmosphere Of Mystery

Texto completo: There is not much air on Mars - the atmospheric pressure there is less than one one-hundredth of what we breathe on Earth - but what little is there has baffled planetary scientists.
Oxygen, which makes up about 0.13% of the Martian atmosphere, is the latest puzzler.
In a paper published in November in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets, scientists working with data gathered by NASA’s Curiosity rover reported that levels of oxygen unexpectedly varied with the seasons on Mars, at least in the neighborhood that Curiosity has been driving around since 2012.
That follows the rover’s reading earlier this year of a large burst of methane, another gas emitted on Earth by living things and which perplexingly disappeared almost immediately.
“It’s confusing but it’s exciting,” said Sushil Atreya, a professor of climate and space sciences and engineering at the University of Michigan who works on Curiosity’s atmospheric measurements. “It keeps us on our toes. Mars is certainly not boring.”
A Mars year lasts 687 days, so the scientists studying the oxygen variations were able to examine the behavior over almost three Martian years, through December 2017.
The level of oxygen “rises relatively higher in the spring,” said Melissa Trainer, a research space scientist at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and lead author of the new paper, “and then it comes down lower, below what we would expect later in the year.”
Carbon dioxide is the main ingredient of Martian air, and scientists have understood for decades its ebb and flow. At the poles in winter, it falls out of the air and freezes to ice, then wafts back into the atmosphere as temperatures warm in the spring.
High in the Martian atmosphere, ultraviolet light breaks apart carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide and oxygen atoms, and then closer to the ground, interactions with water shepherd the oxygen atoms into molecular pairs.
Because oxygen molecules should be pretty stable, persisting about a decade, researchers expected that the amount of oxygen molecules would remain almost constant.
Curiosity’s atmospheric measurements showed exactly that pattern for nitrogen and argon, two other trace gases in the Martian atmosphere. But, for oxygen, the concentrations shot up by a third during spring.
“This was a very unexpected result, an unexpected phenomenon,” Trainer said. “There’s a lot we don’t know about the oxygen cycle on Mars. That’s become apparent.”
Adding to the mystery, the cycle was not the same each year, and the scientists could not find an obvious explanation - like temperature, dust storms or ultraviolet radiation - for what changed from year to year.
On Earth, most oxygen is generated by the photosynthesis of plants. But so far, for the Mars scientists, that is far down on the list of explanations. “You’ve got to rule out all of the other processes first before you go there,” Atreya said.
More likely sources are chemicals like hydrogen peroxide and perchlorates known to exist in the Martian dirt. “It’s pretty clear you need a flux from the surface,” Atreya said. “Nothing in the atmosphere is going to create this kind of rise.”
But how these chemicals might release and absorb enough oxygen to explain the seasonal rise and fall is difficult to figure out, especially as there are only 19 oxygen measurements over 5½ years.
An intriguing possibility is that the oxygen mystery might be tied to another trace gas, methane, that is also acting strangely in the Martian atmosphere.

Texto completo: This is a story about impact.
It's about the impact that occurred on Oct. 16, 2010, when Chris Norton was an 18-year-old football player for Luther College in Decorah, Iowa. Flying down the field to make a tackle, his head collided with an opposing player's knee.
The impact knocked him to the turf, his neck broken — and his life forever altered.
Doctors told him there was only a 3 percent chance he'd ever feel or move anything below the neck again. Yet five years later, with the help of his then-fiancee/future wife Emily, he walked across the stage at his college graduation.
Then, in April 2018, on his wedding day, he walked his wife up the aisle after their Jupiter ceremony.
He's a highly sought after motivational speaker with a new book out and a documentary on the way. He started a charitable foundation.
And he and Emily recently embarked on what might be their biggest challenge yet — parenthood — after adopting five girls.
Norton's inspirational story has made a tremendous impact on the lives of others — all because of the impact on that football field in 2010.
"All these things I've accomplished have been like a chain reaction from that moment," said Norton, 27.
"And if I could go back and change that play, that moment, I wouldn't do it — because I've found a purpose, and a life worth living for."
Norton, who lived in Port St. Lucie for three years before moving to Wellington in May, has seen his inspirational story go global.
His quest to walk again has been covered at length by People magazine.
Video of him walking across the Luther College stage at his graduation went viral, viewed by some 300 million people. He and Emily have been featured on "Good Morning America" and "Fox and Friends," profiled by Sports Illustrated and The New York Times.
Not bad for a small-town Iowa kid who once aspired to be "an all-American football player, get the girl of my dreams and hopefully someday make enough money to own a lake house.
"God had a better plan for me than I had for myself," Norton said.
There were dark moments after the accident, filled with doubt and despair.
"Sitting in a wheelchair as a quadriplegic, it's so easy to focus on what you can't do, what you don't have," Norton said.
He chose, instead, to focus on his goals.
Just a few days after his injury, Norton discovered he could twitch one of his shoulders. Within a year, with assistance, he could stand.
Norton kept pushing, his physical therapy running five to six hours daily. He returned to his classes at Luther College in 2011; a year before he was to receive his diploma, he decided he'd walk across the stage on graduation day.
Video of the event shows Norton being wheeled into position as Emily — to whom he'd proposed the day before — bent down to help him up.
The auditorium exploded in cheers and tears.
A year later, when his physical therapist moved to Port St. Lucie to take a job with the New York Mets organization, Norton and Emily followed. Here, he began training for his next big challenge: walking up the aisle at Abacoa Golf Club in Jupiter after he and Emily exchanged their vows in April 2018.
That seven-yard journey would inspire the title to a book co-authored by Chris and Emily, "The Seven Longest Yards," released in July. A documentary film titled "7 Yards: The Chris Norton Story" is also in the works.
Norton had begun his public speaking career while still in college, telling his story to local clubs and sports teams. In Port St. Lucie he formed his own speaking company, Norton Motivation, and was soon speaking to larger and larger groups.
In one of his "highlight reels" on YouTube, Norton tells a group: "What I discovered is, we all have the ability to stand back up ... and to stand back up stronger than ever before.
"Anything is possible."
In 2012, he started the Chris Norton Foundation, which helps people with spinal cord and muscular disorders live their best lives. Last June, the foundation held its first "'wheelchair camp" in Minnesota, where kids could go ziplining, horseback riding, play laser tag and more.
"We're hoping to do that every year," he said.
Then, late last year, Norton took on his latest challenge: Fatherhood.
He and Emily adopted Whittley Marquez, whom Emily had mentored when Emily was in high school. In August 2016, Whittley asked the couple if they would foster her. Though she was just six years younger than Emily and Chris, the answer was "yes."
"She had nowhere else to go," Norton said. "We talked about the challenges but we also talked about what would happen if we said 'no.' "
Chris and Emily wanted Whittley to graduate high school — and she did.
"And after she moved out we said: We can do this."
They began fostering younger children, and one day got a call. Four sisters — Ava, age 10; Liliana, 8; Isabella, 6; and Ariana, 3 — needed a home; would the Nortons take one of the girls?
They took them all, and "the more the girls were with us, the more it felt like they were our own children," he said. "We wanted to make it official."
And in February, it was, as Chris and Emily adopted all four.
In May, the couple moved to Wellington to be closer to Emily's family — and for Chris to be closer to Palm Beach International Airport as he flies around the country to speaking gigs.
However much impact he's had on people's lives, he's just getting warmed up.
"When I get done with my talk, people realize I'm not a superhero," Norton said. "I'm just a regular guy from a small town who chose to keep taking one step in front of the other and kept a positive attitude,
"And everyone sees they can do that, too."

Texto completo: A brash figure in the financial pages, he bought and sold lucrative radio and concert businesses and controlled the Elvis Presley estate.
Robert F.X. Sillerman, an investor and media executive who built and sold radio empires, controlled the Elvis Presley estate and consolidated the American concert industry, died on Sunday. He was 71.
His brother, Michael, confirmed his death but gave no other details. Mr. Sillerman had recently been living in Hinsdale, N.H.
For decades, Mr. Sillerman was a regular in the headlines of the financial press, buying and selling numerous media and entertainment businesses, often at a huge profit, and presenting a brash public persona that sometimes rivaled those of the celebrities he dealt with.
When Mr. Sillerman tried to corner the fractious world of dance music festivals in the early 2010s, for example, he played the part of a devil-may-care rebel to a sometimes puzzling extent. He posed for publicity photos in clothes emblazoned with profanities, and after a video of Mr. Sillerman making an obscene gesture circulated on social media, a Wall Street analyst was prompted to question his sanity. Mr. Sillerman called it an inside joke.
But for years he had maintained a golden touch in building media franchises and extracting maximum value from them.
Starting in the late 1970s, Mr. Sillerman built a portfolio of radio and television stations worth nearly $ 1 billion. In 1993 he founded SFX Broadcasting with a partner, R. Steven Hicks. Helped by federal deregulation of radio ownership rules, the two were able to quickly amass a chain of more than 70 stations, which they sold in 1997 to a larger rival, Capstar Broadcasting, for $ 2.1 billion.
By that time Mr. Sillerman had turned his sights on another industry ripe for consolidation: the nationwide concert circuit, which had long remained a loosely connected network of venues and promoters who operated regional fiefs.
Over a few years in the late 1990s, Mr. Sillerman and his new company, SFX Entertainment, spent more than $ 2 billion acquiring dozens of promoters and venues, creating the concert world's first truly national force. A crucial part of his strategy was using the nationwide audience at SFX's shows to lure sponsorship deals by big consumer brands like Smirnoff and Levi's.
"We want to make money both by selling tickets and by putting a live audience in front of Madison Avenue," he said in an interview in 1998.
Mr. Sillerman's plan transformed the concert industry even as it drew complaints, which still linger, about rising ticket prices and the outsize power of a centralized super promoter.
In 2000, the radio chain Clear Channel Communications bought SFX for $ 4.4 billion. Five years later, Clear Channel spun off those concert assets into a separate company, Live Nation, which in 2010 merged with Ticketmaster to become Live Nation Entertainment, the biggest concert promoter in the world.
Robert Franklin Sillerman was born in Manhattan on April 12, 1948, to Michael McKinley Sillerman, a radio and television executive, and Estelle (Levande) Sillerman. Robert, who grew up in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, was born on the third anniversary of the death of Franklin D. Roosevelt, and his original middle name was a tribute to the former president.
Mr. Sillerman's marketing talents emerged early. As a teenager he started his own greeting card company, buying cards in bulk and enlisting youngsters to sell them. While attending Brandeis University, he founded Youth Market Consultants, which sold magazine subscriptions to students and in turn advised companies on how to reach that market.
He graduated from Brandeis in 1969 and, three years later, sold Youth Marketing Consultants to Ingalls, an advertising firm in Boston. At Ingalls he met a young copywriter, Laura Baudo, who would become his wife. In addition to Mr. Sillerman's brother, Ms. Baudo Sillerman survives him. Their daughter, Mackinley, died in 2012.
By the time Mr. Sillerman began buying radio stations in the late 1970s, he was using a new name: Robert F.X. Sillerman. He often named his companies using some combination of those initials.
After selling SFX Entertainment, Mr. Sillerman pursued various entertainment projects. He was one of the producers of "The Producers," the Broadway hit, written by his friend Mel Brooks, that ran for six years and pushed the limits of ticket prices on Broadway. He also acquired a majority of the Presley estate, with the right to operate Graceland, the Presley home in Memphis; took over the company behind the long-running television hit "American Idol"; and acquired the rights to Muhammad Ali's name and likeness.
But Mr. Sillerman's success ran out in recent years when he tried to repeat his concert model with a new version of SFX Entertainment, this time going after electronic dance music, or EDM -- a bull market in 2012, when Mr. Sillerman opened the company with a $ 1 billion war chest.
At first, advertisers and investors flocked to the new SFX. But the company's performance was weak, and its stock price eventually plunged by more than 95 percent. It declared bankruptcy in 2016, and many of the assets it had amassed were sold off.
Mr. Sillerman largely withdrew in recent years, moving to New Hampshire and dealing with the fallout from the collapse of several businesses. This year, he agreed to pay a $ 179,000 fine to the Securities and Exchange Commission for defrauding investors of another of his companies, Function(x).
But in making his push for the new version of SFX in 2012, he spoke with boundless optimism about the potential for his new company.
"I'm also confident that we will create a better experience for the fans," Mr. Sillerman said in an interview with The New York Times. "Can we monetize that? If we can, this will dwarf the first SFX. That's the whole game."

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
One afternoon in mid-November, two New York Times designers watched as streams of pinks, oranges, blues and greens whirred by. At the paper's printing plant in College Point, Queens, the staffers, Molly Bedford and Carrie Gee, stood in awe as the press generated a special section that they hoped would offer a new experience for print readers.
Embedded inside the section, "The Future of Streaming," is a 48-inch, twice-folded broadsheet known as a pano-8. Removed from the rest of the section, it acts as a self-contained reading experience.
The articles in the section, which rolled out online in November and were delivered in print this weekend, explored what the culture, business and nature of television and cinema will look like as major media conglomerates like Disney and Apple invest more in the streaming market. It also tackles a question that seems to be plaguing many fans of film and television: Among Netflix, Hulu, Amazon and the hundreds of other streaming services available in the United States alone, which ones are worth it?
Ms. Bedford and Ms. Gee worked closely with a team of editors in The Times's Business and Culture sections. Eight writers analyzed the cornucopia of streaming services -- nine if you consider A.O. Scott, the film critic, debating his alter ego, A.O. Scott, the couch potato. They addressed the chaotic nature of streaming in the entertainment industry, and asked what happens when major media companies embrace disruption.
Connor Ennis, a Business editor, said that he and his colleagues weighed the idea of a streaming-focused section for The Times for over a year. Mr. Ennis worked with Jim Windolf, a media editor, and Lorne Manly and Jeremy Egner of the Culture desk, and they assembled a team of reporters and critics to shed light on the chaotic nature of streaming in the entertainment industry.
"We wanted to mark the moment in some way," Mr. Ennis said. "With a stand-alone special section, especially one that has a lot of ambitious stuff in it, that's kind of a signal to readers that this is a moment you should pay attention to, and here's a package of stories that we think is very helpful or informative."
Ms. Bedford and Ms. Gee hoped to reflect the sense of business disruption in the design. They enlisted Saiman Chow, an illustrator, who created vibrant images and a color scheme inspired by the SMPTE color bar image that was used to calibrate older TVs.
"We wanted to give it the sense of being a little overwhelming because, as a consumer, streaming is incredibly overwhelming," Ms. Bedford said.
Ms. Gee designed a quiz, partly inspired by teen magazines, intended to help readers navigate which streaming service would best suit their interests. She imagined that people could spread this four-page questionnaire out on their living room floor and find themselves somewhere in it.
"I had this vision of people opening it and taking the quiz with their kids," Ms. Gee said. "I think it's really fun, but also my parents, who are totally going to do this because the information is really good here."
"We are visual learners and not everything needs to be told with words; it's similar when you interact with your streaming service," Ms. Bedford said.
The Times has used the pano-8 for special sections before. The Pyeongchang Olympics, Central Park and the migrant journey in Niger have all been shaped to fit the form. But these elaborately folded spreads have always run on their own.
The College Point plant has the rare ability to produce this type of print product, which designers refer to as the "turducken," after the holiday dish in which chicken is stuffed into duck and then put inside a turkey. (In this case, the pano-8 appears within a special section that is stuffed into the Sunday newspaper.)
That meant these Thanksgiving weekend feasts for your eyes needed to be printed two weeks ago so they could be shipped to distribution centers all over the country.
Ms. Bedford and Ms. Gee are optimistic that the future will hold more turduckens of news.
"It's really exciting," Ms. Bedford said. "It's only the beginning."

Texto completo: The initial lineups of original shows on the two streaming services are hit-and-miss. But here are five worth checking out.

Apple TV Plus and Disney Plus have arrived to shovel even more series and films into the overstuffed maw of the TV viewing public, the first of several giant new streaming services entering a marketplace currently dominated by Netflix, Amazon and Hulu. While the main draw for the Disney service, especially, is access to the company's deep archive of films, both it and Apple are also introducing plenty of original series.
But are any of them any good? Well, like most programming slates, the initial lineups are pretty hit-and-miss. But here are a few of the new shows that are worth checking out.
'The Mandalorian'
"Star Wars" films have gallivanted all over galaxies far, far away, but the stories have remained Skywalker-adjacent, or at least tangentially connected to the narrative introduced decades ago in the original trilogy. "The Mandalorian," the first live action series in the "Star Wars" universe, introduces a new narrative set a few years after "Return of the Jedi," with Pedro Pascal ("Narcos") starring as a gunslinging bounty hunter. Werner Herzog alone, playing a mysterious client, might be worth the subscription price. Disney Plus
'Servant'
Tony Basgallop created this bonkers domestic chiller about bougie new parents and the odd au pair they welcome into their spooky old townhouse. (To say much more would be a spoiler.) But the series, which premieres Nov. 28, bears the clear marks of its other executive producer, M. Night Shyamalan, who directed several episodes -- from the shadowy Philadelphia setting to the creepy iconography to the twist at the pilot's end that will almost definitely bring you back for more. Apple TV Plus
'Dickinson'
Hailee Steinfeld plays the poet Emily Dickinson as a high-spirited young woman chafing at the limits of 19th century gender roles. This breezy, knowing comedy has fun with both the details of the poet's biography and the conventions of teen rom-coms, mashing up ye olde trappings with contemporary slang and the occasional bit of stunt casting. (Wiz Khalifa stars as Death.) Apple TV Plus
'Forky Asks a Question'
And it is just the one question. These shorts find the breakout spork from "Toy Story 4," voiced by Tony Hale, interrogating others about kid-friendly concepts like friendship and money. The best part? They're mostly around three minutes long each, proving that streaming content doesn't have to be all-consuming. Disney Plus
'The Morning Show'
This sleek #MeToo drama looks expensive -- it was opulently filmed and stars the A-listers Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon and Steve Carell. Unfortunately, its clumsy topicality and grandstanding tendencies evoke the annoying aspects of Aaron Sorkin (who is not involved with the show) with none of the payoff. You should at least check it out, though, if only to be culturally conversant in one of the fall's most discussed series and reminded that even if you have more money than any company in the history of civilization, TV is hard.

Texto completo: Finding entertainment in the inquiry?
Regarding "Democracy TV" [Nov. 23]: Wow, Lorraine Ali's article was brilliant and right on and so well written and witty.
Thanks for being there for us in these crazy, disgusting times.

Planaria Price, Los Angeles
::
I felt guilty watching so much TV and finishing up with the late afternoon's live broadcast by NPR. Glad to know others were just as riveted, trying to figure out if our present executive branch is as confused and incompetent as appeared after Ambassador [Gordon] Sondland's public testimony.
What validated the time that all of us spent was Fiona Hill's revelation that she finally saw clearly what had been going on, after she saw the recipients of Sondland's e-mails on TV the day before. So these hearings were a chance for the undercover right hand to see what the left hand had been doing under the table.
Margaret Murata
Irvine
::
My guess is that I will have to stand in line to write how offended I was to see the pictures of Fiona Hill, David Holmes, Pete Buttigieg and Elizabeth Warren in the Calendar section above the headline Democracy TV. For you to trivialize these two serious matters passed beyond annoyance and into anger and offense.
I and many others feel like we're watching ourselves teeter on the edge of a precipice -- the loss of democracy in the United States. This is not hyperbole -- we are watching core concepts from our Constitution being stomped on and ignored. And on the front page, the only mention about the impeachment investigation is a headline halfway below the fold about John Bolton. The Times has not been quiet on the Editor's page of your criticism of Trump. Why doesn't the front page back this up?
Kim Banco
Irvine
::
"Fall's Hottest Shows" and "historic 36 hours in the annals of live television." Were you really serious when you wrote this?
A parade of unelected bureaucrats offering hearsay evidence was a total sham and made for boring TV. To watch it was a waste of time.

'Everyman' is no one's problem
Regarding Mary McNamara's column "Time to rethink the 'E' word'" [Nov. 25]: Seriously, "everyman" Tom Hanks was the best you could come up with? It took me five minutes to read and I feel cheated of time I can never get back.
I realize McNamara feels she is some kind of feminist avenger, but I think she did feminism a great disservice.
Lynn Wright
Valencia
::
There's a term used in business classes called "vital factors versus trivia."
If the word "everyman" causes you the issues McNamara describes, I suggest she step away from her desk and review what vital factors she might write about in the future.
Mike Garnet
Palm Desert
::
It seems that McNamara is mostly irritated by the word "everyman" because she thinks it specifically refers to white men, the masculine marker that must be avoided, even though the expression is supposedly genderless, meaning everyperson.
Apparently, though, she's not reluctant to use the conceptual aspect of "death" with the masculine pronoun "himself."
Words evolve and meanings change. Everyman has one meaning today and Mr. Rogers and Tom Hanks, and mostly the characters he portrays, are a perfect representation for that meaning. They're heroes but they're not dynamic nor eccentric individuals.
Conversely, Peter O'Toole in "Lawrence of Arabia," Marlon Brando as Stanley Kowalski, Gary Oldman as Beethoven are actors and characters who would never be identified as "everyman." They're forceful, eccentric and unique personalities opposed to the typical ordinary person.
Giuseppe Mirelli
Los Angeles
::
Mary McNamara takes a perfectly decent term describing a laudable, even noble concept and throws it into the wood chipper of Identity Politics. And for what?
Jeff Schultz
Los Angeles

Get moving on dance, please
While the Los Angeles Dance Project's recent premieres and historic work was praised in the New York Times, LADP's six-week festival was completely ignored by The Times' Calendar Section.
The Times has admirably increased its coverage of local theater. Let's hope more attention is given to L.A.'s large and active dance community.
Irene Oppenheim
West Hollywood
--
Hey, man, where is all that jazz?
The exclusion of jazz from the Los Angeles Times is incomprehensible to me. In all of the great music that is being released today, jazz is deeply embedded.
No mention of the Playboy Jazz Festival? Central Avenue Jazz Festival? Grammy jazz nominees? Come on, L.A. Times, you can do better.
Anthony "Tony" White
Los Angeles
--
It was a nod to herself as well
In August Brown's review of Taylor Swift's AMA artist of the decade award ["Swift pointedly plays her older hits," Nov. 26], he mentions that Carole King made a "subtle allusion" to Swift's predicament by saying that "the best is yet to come."
That is probably correct, but "The Best Is Yet to Come" is also the title of one of King's songs on her album "Wrap Around Joy." The chorus is: "And the best is yet to come, This is only the beginning, And we've only just begun, To realize the best is yet to come."
Carole King knows a thing or two about heartbreak and starting over.
Lisa Marlin
Westchester
--
Justin Chang gets even cooler
Regarding "'Frozen II' is embracing its magic" [Nov. 22]: I always love Justin Chang's reviews. They are both incisive yet entertaining reading. But I think he really reached a new level with his review of "Frozen II" when he referred to Sven's song, "Lost in the Woods," as "The Iceman Hummeth." It made me laugh out loud.
Pat Haley
Fullerton
--
'Key Largo' served on a bun
Regarding Charles McNulty's theater review "Andy Garcia commands 'Key Largo' " [Nov. 23]: Great review, and it looks like a great show.
Bit of trivia, Harry Lewis, the late co-founder of Hamburger Hamlet, was an actor who played Toots Bass in the film version of "Key Largo." He was one of Edward G. Robinson's guys. I worked at Hamburger Hamlet in the '70s and whenever Key Largo was on, every store in the chain had it on the TV in the bar.

Texto completo: Jared Kushner just got a promotion. Another one. At least I think we can call it that, and it’s a deliciously perfect assignment. The pallid princeling is now responsible for speeding construction of the border wall. In other words, a make-believe fixer will oversee a fairy-tale fix.
Josh Dawsey and Nick Miroff of The Washington Post broke the news, and when I read it, I realized that I hadn’t heard much about Jared — or, for that matter, Ivanka — in a good long while. They’re front and center when the administration is announcing some ostensibly sensible initiative or claiming a pittance of progress. But when its corruption is being exposed and the drizzle of subpoenas becomes a downpour, they vanish, cuddling for warmth under the gilded umbrella of their hallucinatory virtue.
We can pretty much chart the weather of the administration by the relative visibility of Donald Jr., so loud and hirsute, and Jared, so smooth-cheeked and mute. Donald Jr. thrives when it’s nastiest, stomping gleefully through the muck. Jared comes out only if his suit won’t get dirty or his hair wet.
During the impeachment inquiry, we’ve seen a lot of Donald Jr. That’s partly because he has been hawking his new book, copies of which the Republican National Committee spent nearly $100,000 on. But it’s also because he’s such a ready, eager conduit for his father’s wrath, with a talent for exaggeration and misdirection that’s clearly chromosomal.
Jared and Ivanka have been strategically scarce, though Ivanka did flutter into view, in a fashion, when President Donald Trump boasted two weeks ago that she had created 14 million jobs since the inauguration. “Fourteen million and going up!” he clarified, lest anyone get the misimpression that she thought her work was done. Never! On behalf of the American people, Ivanka is tireless. There’s no rest for the weary, and there’s even less of it for those who live at the crossroads of self-infatuation and delusion.
In an interview last month on Fox Business, Ivanka said that she and Dad were “fighting every day for the American worker” and that she was determined to “drive hard every single day to make an impact.”
“Your time and service — our time here — is finite,” she mused, and while I’d love to believe that she was prophesying her and her father’s imminent eviction from the White House, I think she was referring, in her deeply spiritual way, to the span of a human life. “It’s sand through an hourglass.” As Ivanka serves us, she never forgets the sand.
Democrats believe that the Trump administration’s void of ethics will sour American voters on the president. But those voters are likelier to abandon him for the administration’s vacuum of competence — for his nonsensical managerial style, captured in his magical thinking about Jared.
He tasked Jared with reinventing the federal government. Unless constant rash firings, unfilled jobs and shakedowns of foreign governments constitute reinvention, this remains on Jared’s infinite to-do list. The president put Jared in charge of brokering a durable peace between Israelis and Palestinians. Insert punch line here. He followed Jared’s counsel that faith be placed in Saudi Arabia and its crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. We know how that worked out.
The president somehow looked at that track record and decided that the dynamo he should entrust with his central campaign promise — a secure barrier between the United States and Mexico — was … Jared! And so we have the trillionth gorgeous example of his investment in fiction.
Nearly three years into Trump’s presidency, the border wall barely exists. Subtract the upgrading of fencing and such that was already there and Trump has, by some recent estimates, constructed fewer than 25 miles of actually new barrier. The southwestern border is nearly 2,000 miles long.
But Jared is on the case! According to The Post, he “convenes biweekly meetings in the West Wing, where he questions an array of government officials about progress” and “explains the president’s wishes.” Huh. Those wishes are hardly cryptic, and how complicated can this questioning be? Already, The Post reported, there’s grumbling that Jared is just an annoyance.
That belittles his symbolic significance. Many journalists, including me, have tried to settle on the perfect mascot for the Trump administration. There are choices galore. The greedy, vainglorious Scott Pruitt, who did his best to decimate the Environmental Protection Agency, fit the bill, but he’s long gone. Mike Pompeo embodies the Faustian arc of so many of the president’s aides and allies, from principle-driven dismissal of Trump during the 2016 campaign to reputation-torching submission when he dangled a ticket to the big time.
But for naked opportunism and situational scruples, Jared’s my guy. Remember how he and Ivanka were going to contain the president’s ego, blunt his cruelty, whisper sweet moderation in his ear? That was then. Now he’s devoting himself to an exorbitant, unnecessary monument to Trump’s nativism and xenophobia.
There’s an upside, though. With Jared in the saddle, this horse won’t go far.

Texto completo: Wind down from Thanksgiving with a film about simmering family tensions, or opt for Will Ferrell in tights.
What's Streaming
KRISHA (2015) Stream on Netflix. If you made it through Thanksgiving with your sanity just barely intact, take comfort in knowing that the holiday can be a stressful time for many. The "Waves" director Trey Edward Shults tapped members of his own family to explore how taxing it can be, specifically for people with mental health and addiction issues, for his feature debut, "Krisha." His aunt, Krisha Fairchild, plays the title character, a 60-something woman who has been estranged from her family for years because of unspoken transgressions. She re-emerges on Thanksgiving with an offer to cook the turkey and the promise that her life is back on track. As she prepares, tensions begin to simmer -- thanks in part to the film's sound design and camerawork -- until the gathering boils over into catastrophe. "Few movies bore into a character's head as deeply as 'Krisha,' and with such uncompromising ferocity," Manohla Dargis wrote in her review, in which she designated this film a New York Times Critic's Pick.
What's on TV
ELF (2003) 7 p.m. and 9 p.m. on AMC. Whether you feel anxious going into the holiday season, or as if you can finally breathe a sigh of relief for having made it through the year, this classic Christmas movie is almost guaranteed to get you in the festive spirit. "'Elf' is a charming, silly family Christmas movie more likely to spread real joy than migraine, indigestion and sugar shock," A.O. Scott wrote in his review in The New York Times. "The movie succeeds because it at once restrains its sticky, gooey good cheer and wildly overdoes it." There's still something delightful about watching Will Ferrell walk around New York City in tights and childlike wonderment 16 years after the film was originally released.
BLUE PLANET NOW 9 p.m. on BBC America. On the season finale of this nature documentary series, the hosts Steve Backshall, Liz Bonnin and Chris Packham make their final dispatches about the ocean's well-being from the three marine hot spots where they're stationed. Rather than just capturing how marine life exists, the show focuses on how these environments are changing because of pollution, poaching and climate change. In Australia, Bonnin meets the scientists spearheading coral reef restoration projects, while Backshall swims with the endangered great hammerhead shark in the Bahamas. Off the Baja Peninsula in Mexico, Packham witnesses the courtship behavior of humpback whales, whose population has bounced back after regulations were placed on commercial whaling practices.
CHRISTMAS IN ROME 9 p.m. on Hallmark. After charming audiences in "Desperate Housewives" and "Gossip Girl," Sam Page has teamed up with Lacey Chabert (who played Gretchen Wieners in "Mean Girls") for this holiday special about two Americans who find romance abroad. Page plays Oliver, a traveling business executive interested in buying an Italian ceramics company. When he hires Angela (Chabert), a tour guide working in Rome, to help him learn Italian, he grows to love more than just the city and its language.

Texto completo: Dark Waters (PG-13) Age 14+ Essential, harrowing true story of environmental crime.
'Dark Waters' is a drama based on a 2016 New York Times Magazine article about huge chemical company DuPont knowingly using toxic substances in its billion-dollar products. Mark Ruffalo plays real-life lawyer Robert Bilott, who's fighting for the chemical's victims. The movie is harrowing and unsettling but extremely well-made and absolutely worth watching. Expect some disturbing images, including sick and dying cows, diseased cow parts, deformities in humans, shooting a cow with a rifle (some blood shown) and a house being set on fire. Language is fairly strong, with a couple uses of 'f---,' plus 's---,' 'goddamn' and more. Teens skinny-dip in one scene, and a bare bottom is briefly seen. There's social drinking at a party and background cigarette smoking. (127 minutes)


White Snake (Unrated) Age 13+ Chinese folklore-based adventure is dark, violent, sensual.
'White Snake' is an animated action-adventure tale based in Chinese folklore that has enough dark violence and mature sensuality to make it iffy for younger viewers. The film is a prequel of sorts to the Chinese legend of White Snake: It follows a white snake demon (who can change into the form of a young woman) who loses her memory while in human form and ends up falling in love with the young man who finds her. The story is fairly complicated, and the battles between the snake demons and their enemies are destructive and violent, leaving humans and demons dead and villages destroyed. Sexual content includes scenes of partial nudity (bare backs and legs, and a quick glimpse of a woman's bottom), as well as passionate kissing in one fade-to-black love scene in which it's clear that the central couple has spent the night together. So it's not for little kids, but teens and adults who enjoy foreign animation or legend-based stories will appreciate the film and its connection to Chinese folklore. (98 minutes)


Knives Out (PG-13) Age 13+ Expert, effortlessly entertaining all-star mystery-comedy.
'Knives Out' is a delightful all-star murder-mystery-comedy that's reminiscent of Agatha Christie stories. Violence includes a murder victim with a slit throat and a trickle of blood, fighting (punching and slapping), arguing and harsh dialogue. Language includes one 'f---,' plus 's---,' 'son of a b----,' 'a--hole' and more. There's a bit of sex-related talk, and one character is said to have had an affair. People drink at a party, characters smoke cigars and pot (there's a secret stash of joints), prescription meds are injected and there's dialogue about a morphine addict. Starring Daniel Craig, Jamie Lee Curtis, Chris Evans, and many more, this expertly crafted movie is both a satisfying mystery and a hilarious comedy with appealing characters, and it even touches on the state of the world and sends the message that kindness and compassion are virtues that win the day. (120 minutes)

Let It Snow (PG-13) Streaming
Age 13+ Fun teen ensemble rom-com has language, drinking.
'Let It Snow' is a fast-paced holiday rom-com in which a group of Midwestern teens spends Christmas Eve managing emotional challenges, both separately and together. Other than twins who bully others in brief sequences " in one, they repeatedly slam a skater to the ice " there aren't any villains. But the kids are sometimes their own worst enemies. They make mistakes or misbehave; learn important truths about themselves, their relationships and their families; and then work toward resolving their issues. Expect some swearing and sexual references/innuendo, including 'balls,' 'a--,' 's---,' 'hell,' 'b----' and one instance each of 'f---,' 'd---' and 'p---y.' Characters kiss, and there's some underage drinking/partying with no obvious consequences. It's based on the 2009 YA book by John Green, Lauren Myracle and Maureen Johnson. (93 minutes)

Bonneville Salt Flats are where cars try to hit mach 1, but the salt of the earth is crumbling

Texto completo: Not even 30 years after Karl Benz built what is said to be the first automobile, Teddy Tetzlaff climbed into a Blitzen Benz racecar and blasted across the snow-white surface of the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah, clocking in at 142.8 mph and setting an unofficial land-speed record.
This 1914 effort certainly generated publicity for Tetzlaff, a California-born racer, and the German automaker, Benz & Cie, that built his car, but the locale was most likely a mere footnote at the time.
The automotive legacy of the salt flats wasn’t cemented until 1935, when Malcolm Campbell rode his Blue Bird past 300 mph and into the record books: Bonneville was extremely well-suited to high-speed driving.
After Campbell’s feat, speed merchants from all over the globe came to realize that Bonneville was an excellent venue for those who want to drive fast. Very fast. The hard halite surface provided a smooth but grippy 13-mile straightaway for pursuing the ultimate prize in motorsports, the land speed record. Soon, attempts to drive faster than anyone had ever driven became a hallmark of the ancient lake bed. After 300 mph, more barriers fell: 400, 500, then 600 mph.
The otherworldly white surface began forming at the end of the last ice age when Lake Bonneville receded. The dry lake bed is composed of minerals — including gypsum, potassium chloride (potash) and an abundance of sodium chloride (table salt). The minerals are deposited on the surface when brine from an aquifer below rises in winter before drying in the spring and summer. As the liquid evaporates, winds kiss the lake bed, leaving a smooth layer composed largely of salt. The crust has been growing thicker in this manner for thousands of years.
But the past 50 years have distressed the course. Tom Burkland, board vice president of the Save the Salt Coalition, composed largely of racing enthusiasts, says the salt crust was more than 4 feet thick when he first raced at Bonneville in the 1960s. Now, in many places it is less than 1 inch thick and fragile.
And while the usable racecourse was once 13 miles long, it has now shrunk to about 7 miles. At this length, the course is too short for the fastest racecars and record attempts. (The current record is over 760 mph, set in the Black Rock Desert of Nevada.)
The world was reminded of the salt’s vulnerability in 2018 when two Utah residents tore it up doing doughnuts in a modified Ford Crown Victoria. Circling at high speed, they ripped up the now-thin surface, creating deep ruts. They did a lot of damage but rekindled national interest in restoration efforts that have long been championed by Save the Salt and the Specialty Equipment Market Association, a trade group representing manufacturers of equipment used by racers.
The Bonneville racing community believes that potash mining is most responsible for the salt flats’ degradation. Potash is a component of the brine that bubbles up in the spring and thickens the salt layer. But since the federal Bureau of Land Management first issued mining leases in 1963, mining companies have been pumping the brine into facilities across Interstate 80, south of the salt flats.
There, potash is precipitated out of the brine. The common salt is left behind and stored on the mining company’s property. Bonneville proponents have long argued that the salt should be returned to the racecourse once the potash has been extracted.
Today, surface mining of the brine has largely ceased, but it is still being pumped out of wells on the mining company property by Intrepid Potash, current holder of the mining lease. That lowers the aquifer below the salt flats and reduces the amount of brine that rises to the surface, so natural restoration is minimal.
[ Read more: Now there’s a $50 million plan to save Utah’s famous Bonneville Salt Flats, but will it work? ]
The racers have regularly complained to the mining companies over the years, but according to Louise Ann Noeth, an author of Bonneville motorsports books and public relations representative for Save the Salt, they were complaining to the wrong entity. The Bureau of Land Management is at fault, Noeth said: “The lease basically says the mining companies can wreak havoc and only have to repair it when mining activity has concluded. The language in the lease was meant for other kinds of mines where damage can’t be repaired until mining has ceased.”
Brenda Bowen, director of the Global Change and Sustainability Center at the University of Utah, has studied the salt flats. “Everything that happens on and around the salt crust has some kind of impact on this ephemeral landscape,” Bowen said. However, it is difficult to pin the degradation on any single activity, she added: “A century of extraction has certainly changed the landscape, but so has the racing.”
At times, mining companies have been mindful of the need to preserve this natural treasure and have mixed some of the waste salt with water and pumped it back onto the salt flats.
In recent years, Intrepid Potash has been returning 0.6 million tons or less of salt brine to Bonneville’s surface. According to a document published by Save the Salt, Intrepid’s effort has helped stabilize the salt but is not sufficient to expand it.
“To Intrepid’s credit, they’re sending salt to Bonneville that wasn’t transferred from the north end,” said Stuart Gosswein, director of government affairs for the Specialty Equipment Market Association.
That’s all well and good, but the racers want the salt replenishment to be abundant and mandatory, and they let government officials know in an email campaign that sent more than 1,000 missives to Utah state legislators. That prompted the Legislature to create a Bonneville restoration project.
The Legislature appropriated $5 million, with a catch. The funds are contingent on securing commitments from other sources. An additional $45 million will be needed to complete the project, which will require new infrastructure. Save the Salt expects some of the funding will be provided through contributions from the motorsports community but realizes that Congress and the Bureau of Land Management will have to provide the bulk of it.
Gosswein is hopeful. When asked if an appropriation from Congress was forthcoming, he said, “We’re optimistic that there will be money set aside for the fiscal year, and that the BLM will allocate funds for the restoration.”
The $50 million in state and federal money would fund a 10-year brine-pumping program that would return 1.5 million tons of brine or more each year with the goal of restoring the original 13-mile racecourse and thickening the salt crust substantially.
Noeth, who is known as Land Speed Louise to the racers and her readers, is pleased but wants to see work begin.
“I want tomorrow’s children to have the same gee-whiz exposure to land speed racing that we have enjoyed,” she said.

‘The Daily Show’ host Trevor Noah will bring his Loud &amp; Clear Tour to Staples Center

Texto completo: Southern California has always had a special place in the heart of Trevor Noah. The 35-year-old South African writer, producer, comedian, political commentator, actor and current host of Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show,” first cut his teeth in some of the area’s smaller comedy clubs and theaters.
After starting out in 100 to 300-capacity rooms, Noah graduated to 1,000 to 3,000-capacity theaters and eventually worked his way up to selling out the 8,000-capacity Pacific Amphitheatre in Costa Mesa in 2018. His latest stand-up outing, dubbed The Loud & Clear Tour, is now playing out in arenas across the country and Noah will return to Southern California to headline Staples Center in Downtown Los Angeles Friday, Dec. 6.
“I’ve been lucky that California has been one of the places where I’ve had a lot of support from the days of having like a really tiny following,” Noah said during a recent interview as he was also in the midst of taping “The Daily Show” back in New York. “It has been a really wonderful, sort of gradual celebration that just keeps growing. That’s the only way I can look at this show (at Staples Center) because otherwise it becomes overwhelming and you start worrying too much about the size of the show as opposed to the quality of the show.”
Despite hosting a television show where the primary topic is to analyze and report on politics, Noah said that’s not what his comedy show is. He’s said in previous interviews that he doesn’t talk about those things, including the President of the United States, so specifically but speaks rather generally when it comes to getting political.
“The live comedy audience has always been more diverse and also more broad in their taste,” he said. “‘The Daily Show’ is obviously a show based around politics and news and not everybody wants to live in that world, which I completely understand. But when it comes to stand-up, I’ve been really lucky. I have Republicans come to my shows and they’ll say ‘Hey, I love your stand-up … I don’t like your political views, but I love coming to your stand-up shows.’ That’s fine with me. I don’t think we have to agree with each other on everything, but I like that we can still all laugh together as people. I’ve always enjoyed that people of all ages, all religions, ethnicities and politics affiliations come to the shows. I want you to have fun whether you come with your mom and dad, boyfriend or girlfriend, your siblings, your friends … I just want you to have a good time. It’s not a show designed for one specific person, it’s designed for everybody.”
Doing the stand-up tour gives Noah a break from the 24/7 news cycle and all the commotion and breaking news that comes with ongoing impeachment hearings and the ramping up of yet another election year.
“It is a nice break and I think people should take that break in life, too,” he said. “People always ask me, ‘How do you cope with Trump all the time?’ It’s not healthy and I only deal with it during the day while making a show that’s 30 minutes long. If you engage in politics for 30 minutes a day, that’s more than enough to get all of the information you need since most of it is repetitive anyway. You don’t have to live in it and I try not to. I understand how important it is to our world and I give it the attention it deserves, but I also make sure to go live my life as a human being, too.”
On top of working on his stand-up material, Noah said he also listens to a lot of music. Nothing specific at the moment, but he said he’s a sucker for a good playlist on Spotify or Tidal. He picked up and is currently reading the new Prince biography, “The Beautiful Ones,” which was released in late October. He also said that if he had to choose between either being on “The Masked Singer” or “Dancing With the Stars,” he’d pick “The Masked Singer.”
“Because I’d be covered the entire time and my embarrassment is limited to when I have to take my mask off,” he said with a laugh. “I don’t think people would know it was me based on how badly or how well I could sing, which is nice.”
Noah has already accomplished a lot in his lifetime. He’s obviously got a successful stand-up career and daily TV show, but his book “Born a Crime: Stories from a South African Childhood,” became a New York Times Bestseller and his “Son of Patricia” special and album is nominated in the best comedy category at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards, which will be held Jan. 26 at Staples Center.
“I live a very strange life in that I’ve never been too worried about the distant future,” Noah said. “I just try to focus on what I’m doing now and try to do it to the best of my ability and I found that serves me well. Right now, all I’m focused on is the Loud & Clear Tour and ‘The Daily Show,’ just making sure I put together a great show on TV every night and making sure that the stand-up is a world-class comedy experience. Once that’s all done, I’ll focus on the next thing. The last thing I want to do is start focusing too far into the future and tripping on the thing that’s right in front of me.”

Texto completo: President Donald Trump said in an interview posted online Tuesday that he planned to designate Mexican drug cartels as terrorist organizations, owing to what he said was the high number of Americans killed by their activities.
The comments, which were made in an interview with former Fox News host Bill O’Reilly and posted to his personal website, represent a shift in United States policy that the Mexican foreign minister, Marcelo Ebrard, told reporters on Monday he did not believe would happen.
“I will be designating the cartels,” Trump said in the interview. “I have been working on that for the last 90 days. You know, designation is not that easy, you have to go through a process, and we are well into that process.”
Deadly violence by drug cartels in Mexico gained new attention in the United States in recent weeks after the killing of six children and their three mothers, all dual Mexican and U.S. citizens, who were part of a fundamentalist Mormon community in the north of the country.
After that ambush, Trump said on Twitter that the time had come “for Mexico, with the help of the United States, to wage WAR on the drug cartels and wipe them off the face of the earth.”
In the interview posted online Tuesday, Trump declined to say what measures he would consider taking once the cartels had been designated as terrorist organizations. When O’Reilly asked if drone strikes in Mexico were a possibility, the president replied, “I don’t want to say what I am going to do, but they will be designated.”

“Look, we are losing 100,000 people a year to what is happening and what is coming through from on Mexico,” the president said, without elaborating. “They have unlimited money, the people, the cartels, because they have a lot of money, because it is drug money and human trafficking money.”
The administration of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico seemed to be caught off-guard by Trump’s declarations.
In a statement issued Tuesday night, the Mexican Foreign Ministry said it had “entered into communication with the various corresponding authorities” of the United States “to know the content and the reach” of Trump’s statements. The ministry also said it would seek to set up a high-level meeting “as soon as possible” to address the issue.
“The Government of Mexico will continue its diplomatic work towards an understanding that, through cooperation and intelligence, guarantees the security of both countries,” the statement said.
Ebrard, the foreign minister, had said a day earlier that he did not expect the U.S. government to seek to designate Mexican drug trafficking organizations as terrorists, and suggested that the two countries were already working together closely enough in the fight against those groups without the need for that legal designation.
“You do not need to designate or classify a specific group as terrorist so that we act together against it,” Ebrard said.
Once a group has been designated as a terrorist organization, it is illegal for people in the United States to knowingly provide support for it, and its members are barred from entering the country. Financial institutions are also forbidden from doing business with the organization.
Arturo Sarukhán, a former Mexican ambassador to Washington, said the designation would create “a series of collateral effects” with profound implications for the relationship between the United States and Mexico.
The designation would not only have an impact on the bilateral strategy to combat narcotrafficking, but could also have “very broad and brutal political, diplomatic, financial, economic and commercial consequences,” he said in an interview on Milenio Televisión, a Mexican network.
It would also have the political effect of reinforcing “this narrative of Mexico as a threat to the national security of the United States,” Sarukhán said, noting that the timing coincided with the start of the presidential campaign.
“It’s something that really can be very, very, very disruptive for the bilateral relationship,” he said.
The interview between Trump and O’Reilly that was posted online Tuesday evening was a clip from a longer conversation between the two. O’Reilly said the full interview would be available to people who bought a premium membership to his personal website.

Michelle Goldberg: The Republicans’ big lies on Trump and Russia

Texto completo: There are two very big lies that President Donald Trump and his sycophants have used, through aggressive, bombastic repetition, to shape the public debate about impeachment, and about Trump’s legitimacy more broadly.
The first big lie is that “the people” elected Trump and that the constitutional provision of impeachment would invalidate their choice. In fact, Trump is president only because a constitutional provision invalidated the choice of the American people. Trump lost the popular vote and might have lost the Electoral College without Russian interference and yet many Democrats and pundits have been bullied into accepting the fiction that he has democratic, and not just constitutional, legitimacy.
The second big lie is that Russia didn’t help elect Trump, and that the president has been absolved of collusion. It’s true that the report by Robert Mueller, the former special counsel, did not find enough evidence to prove a criminal conspiracy between Trump’s campaign and Russian state actors. But the Mueller report found abundant evidence that the campaign sought Russian help, benefited from that help and obstructed the FBI investigation into Russian actions. His investigation resulted in felony convictions for Trump’s former campaign chairman, deputy campaign chairman, personal lawyer, first national security adviser and longtime political adviser, among others.
Had public life in America not been completely deformed by blizzards of official lies, right-wing propaganda and the immovable wall of Republican bad faith, the Mueller report would have ended Trump’s minoritarian presidency. Instead, something utterly perverse happened. Democrats, deflated by the Mueller report’s anticlimactic rollout, decided to move on rather than keep the focus on Trump’s world-historic treachery. Republicans, meanwhile, started screaming about a “Russia hoax” ostensibly perpetrated on their dear leader. Among them was the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, who in 2016 was surreptitiously recorded telling his congressional colleagues that he thinks President Vladimir Putin of Russia pays Trump. “Swear to God,” he said at the time.
This brings us to where we are now. Democrats understand that the Ukraine scandal is an outgrowth of the Russia scandal — as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said last month, with Trump, “all roads seem to lead to Putin.” Yet they’ve made the political calculation that reopening the broader story of how Trump has been compromised by Russia is a political loser.
Rather, it’s Republicans, with their heroic capacity for shamelessness, who want to talk about Russia. They’ve set out to investigate the investigators, trying to make efforts to uncover the truth about Trump’s Russia connections, rather than the connections themselves, into a scandal. And now they’re trying to expand their big lie about Russia to cover Ukraine as well. The president, McCarthy said last month, “was trying to get to the bottom, just as every American would want to know, why did we have this Russia hoax that actually started within Ukraine.”
Because Republicans have been so successful in shrouding the origins of the Russia investigation in a miasma of misinformation, I hope some talented filmmaker makes a movie out of the new book by Glenn Simpson and Peter Fritsch, “Crime in Progress: Inside the Steele Dossier and the Fusion GPS Investigation of Donald Trump.” Simpson and Fritsch are co-founders of Fusion GPS, the research firm that investigated Trump during the 2016 campaign, first for the conservative Washington Free Beacon, and then for a lawyer for the Hillary Clinton campaign.
It was Fusion GPS that hired British ex-spy Christopher Steele to look into Trump’s Russia connections, and it sits at the center of countless pro-Trump conspiracy theories. When Republicans controlled the House, Fritsch told me Monday, “The only bank records that were subpoenaed by the House Intelligence Committee were ours.”
“Crime in Progress” is the best procedural yet written about the discovery of Trump’s Russia ties. It demolishes a number of right-wing talking points, including the claim that the Steele dossier formed the basis of the FBI’s counterintelligence inquiry into Trump. But it also makes plain what many Republicans knew before the 2016 election, even if they’ve now pretended to forget it. For years, Trump was financially entangled with organized crime as well as with Kremlin-friendly oligarchs, and by keeping those entanglements secret, he gave Putin leverage over him from the moment he took office.
Write Simpson and Fritsch, “In the end, the Mueller probe sidestepped the question that so unnerved Fusion GPS and Christopher Steele in the summer of 2016: Was the president of the United States under the influence of a foreign adversary?” Republicans have used all the power at their command to defame people who’ve asked this question. Perhaps that’s because otherwise they’d have to take seriously all the evidence that the answer is yes.

Giuliani Weighed Doing Business With Ukrainian Government; Trump's lawyer drew up retainer agreements with Yuriy Lutsenko and the Ukraine Justice Ministry worth $500,000 before deciding against the arrangement

Texto completo: Rudy Giuliani said Wednesday he was in talks earlier this year to earn hundreds of thousands of dollars from Ukrainian government officials but decided against it as he pushed the country to pursue investigations sought by his client, President Trump.
In January, Yuriy Lutsenko, then Ukraine's prosecutor general, asked Mr. Giuliani to represent the Ukrainian Ministry of Justice and him personally on two matters, Mr. Giuliani said in an interview. Mr. Giuliani said he subsequently drew up two retainer agreements, for a total of about $500,000, and gave them to Mr. Lutsenko.
The next day, Mr. Giuliani decided he couldn't represent Mr. Lutsenko personally because he believed doing so would pose a conflict with his representation of the president, he said, but continued to consider the Ministry of Justice contract. He said he ultimately declined that one, too, and was never "paid a penny" in connection with the proposed arrangements.
Mr. Lutsenko, who was removed from his post in August, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
Mr. Giuliani's discussions about representing Mr. Lutsenko and the Ukrainian ministry came, he said, as he was meeting the Ukrainian prosecutor in New York to discuss an entirely different matter: investigations the president was seeking into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, as well as into alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. election.
Mr. Biden's son sat on the board of the Ukrainian gas company Burisma Group while his father was overseeing U.S. policy toward Ukraine. The Bidens deny any wrongdoing.
U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded it was Russia, not Ukraine, that interfered in the 2016 election.
The talks between Mr. Giuliani and the Ukrainian officials were reported earlier by the New York Times and the Washington Post.
The push for those investigations by Mr. Giuliani and the president ultimately led to a phone call between Mr. Trump and the new Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, which set off the impeachment inquiry this fall. The overlap between Mr. Giuliani's business interests in Ukraine and his campaign on behalf of Mr. Trump is also at the center of a growing investigation by Manhattan federal prosecutors, which among other matters is examining whether the president's personal attorney might have violated rules on domestic and foreign lobbying.
A recent broad subpoena issued by the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office sought records of any payments to Mr. Giuliani and records related to his consulting firm, Giuliani Partners, The Wall Street Journal has reported .
Mr. Trump has called the impeachment inquiry a hoax that should end. Mr. Giuliani has denied wrongdoing.
More recently, Mr. Giuliani said, he was in talks to help represent Privat Bank, Ukraine's largest lender, in a lawsuit against the former co-owners of the bank, Igor Kolomoisky and Gennadiy Bogolyubov. Mr. Giuliani said he met with lawyers at the law firm Quinn Emanuel about the case, but ultimately decided against it.
Lawyers for Quinn Emanuel in Europe saw Mr. Giuliani's public mentions about Mr. Kolomoisky and believed he might have information that would be helpful to their case, according to a person familiar with the talks. After two meetings with Mr. Giuliani, the person said, it became clear that he didn't have any independent information about Mr. Kolomoisky and the law firm determined "there was no role for him."
Founded in 1992 in Ukraine's industrial east, PrivatBank grew into the country's biggest privately owned lender. After the 2014 revolution, the central bank set about cleaning up a banking sector beset by bad loans and inadequate capital. Backed by the International Monetary Fund, which has lent billions to Ukraine, regulators closed nearly 80 lenders. As its rivals shut down, PrivatBank increased its share of the country's deposits to around one-third by the time it was nationalized in 2016.
When Mr. Lutsenko asked Mr. Giuliani about representing him in January, he said he wanted Mr. Giuliani's help to arrange a meeting with the Justice Department, Mr. Giuliani said. "He wanted me to walk him into the Justice Department," Mr. Giuliani said.
He said he referred Mr. Lutsenko to Victoria Toensing and Joe diGenova, a wife-and-husband legal team close to Mr. Giuliani. At one point, Mr. Giuliani said, Mr. Lutsenko tried to arrange for Mr. Giuliani to work for Ms. Toensing and Mr. diGenova as an investigator, an arrangement Mr. Giuliani declined.
Mr. Giuliani spent more time considering working for the Ukrainian Ministry of Justice, which he believed could help him get more information about money laundering, he said. He said he was only considering working on a portion of the ministry's case, which involved helping recover certain funds.
"I wasn't considering taking on the whole case, otherwise I would have charged $1 million," he said.
He ultimately referred that case to Ms. Toensing and Mr. diGenova, too, he said, adding that some of the retainers also named them.
Mark Corallo, a spokesman for the two lawyers, said in a statement: "We have always stated that we agreed to represent Ukrainian whistleblowers. Only because it was already public did we state that Yuriy Lutsenko was one of them. All the other names are attorney-client privileged, and it is unfortunate that some unethical person chose to violate that privilege."
Mr. Corallo said the retainer agreements involving Mr. Giuliani, his associates and Ukrainian officials, which were never signed, "contain the necessary notice of [Foreign Agents Registration Act] registration." Individuals are required to register with the Justice Department if they lobby in the U.S. on behalf of a foreign entity.
While Mr. Giuliani ultimately didn't represent either Mr. Lutsenko or the Ministry of Justice, he continued to be in close contact with the Ukrainian prosecutor. In their January meeting, Mr. Lutsenko told Mr. Giuliani he thought there were unanswered questions about the Bidens' role in Ukraine.
Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Lutsenko met again in Warsaw in February and continued to be in touch over the following months. In May, Mr. Giuliani planned a trip to Kyiv where he was planning to press the incoming president, Mr. Zelensky, to pursue investigations into the Bidens and alleged election interference. Ms. Toensing was planning to travel there with him, but Mr. Giuliani ultimately canceled the trip after news of it was reported.
Mr. Lutsenko served as prosecutor general of Ukraine from May 2016 through August 2019. In addition to discussing investigations into the Bidens and election interference with Mr. Giuliani, he worked alongside the president's lawyer to push for the removal of Marie Yovanovitch from her post as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. In March, Mr. Lutsenko told the news outlet the Hill that Ms. Yovanovitch had given him a list of people not to prosecute, an allegation that the State Department dubbed an "outright fabrication" and that Mr. Lutsenko later recanted.
Mr. Trump ultimately ordered Ms. Yovanovitch removed from her post in the spring, after hearing concerns from Mr. Giuliani and others. Mr. Lutsenko was dismissed from his post as prosecutor general in August.

Empathy is good, but what if you care too much?

Texto completo: There's a cost to caring too much.
Two prominent mental health counselors – a resilience expert at an Ivy League college and a megachurch pastor – died by suicide in September. At the 2017 U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation's Health Means Business summit, Arianna Huffington, sleep evangelist and author of "The Sleep Revolution: Transforming Your Life, One Night at a Time," said people who toil in the charitable space often have the most trouble detaching from work and, well, going to bed.
Meanwhile, Justin Phillips, a mother who lost her son to a drug overdose, is trying to start the #chooseempathy movement. She founded Overdose Lifeline to raise awareness that addiction is not a choice and requires empathetic responses.
Dr. Judith Orloff, a psychiatrist and self-described empath, agrees society needs more empathy given the rising rates of addiction, suicide and mental illness, among other challenges. But she cautions those who choose to be empathic – or find it comes naturally – about the need to care for themselves first.
The New York Times best-selling author's new book, "Thriving as an Empath: 365 Days of Self-Care for Sensitive People" (Sounds True publishing), is now in stores.
Here, she talks with USA TODAY health policy reporter Jayne O'Donnell, who calls herself an "overempathizer."
Question: How do you know if you are an empath? What are the character traits?
Dr. Judith Orloff: Ordinary empathy is the ability to feel someone else's pain as well as their joy, the ability for us to be open-hearted. It's such a beautiful trait. Being an empath, however, goes further. Empaths have extremely sensitive neurological systems and don't have the usual filters that other people have, so they feel things intensely and often are emotional sponges who take on other people's stress if they don't learn how to set boundaries and practice other self-care techniques ... Most empaths are introverts like myself, but some are extroverts who love socializing but still need to decompress afterwards to take care of themselves.
As part of my research on empaths, I developed a 20-question self-assessment test in my earlier book, "The Empath's Survival Guide," to determine if you are an empath. Some of the questions include: Have I been labeled as overly sensitive? (in a derogatory way). Do crowds drain me, and do I need a lot of alone time to replenish myself? Do I take on other people's stress or emotions? Do I replenish myself in nature? Am I super-sensitive to noise, smells and excessive talking?
Empaths have many special challenges and also many gifts.
Q: There's a clear need for more empathy in our country, isn't there?
Orloff: I believe empathy is the most precious trait in human nature. We need more of it in our country and in the world. Empathy is the ability to put yourself in someone else's shoes so you can see their point of view. Empathy is so powerful because it opens our hearts. It allows us to try to understand another person's position, even if we don't particularly like them or if we disagree on an issue. This gives us the best chance of successfully communicating with them and resolving differences.
Q: But there are risks in caring too much, aren't there?
Orloff: Yes, I've seen many of my patients, including empaths and all sensitive people, care too much and become burned out by empathy overload – or get involved with addictions, including substances, food and sex to numb themselves out. In my psychotherapy practice, there has been an epidemic of empathic patients consulting me who are exhausted, anxious, depressed and overwhelmed by added stress in their personal lives, which is aggravated by our world's non-stop stress.
Arianna Huffington reports that over two-thirds of doctors in the U.S. say they are burned out, depressed or both! Plus the general suicide rate in our country just keeps going up. Those in the helping professions have trouble turning stress off so they also tend to experience impaired sleep and increased anxiety.
Q: What are the most effective ways for empaths to establish boundaries?
Orloff: Taking adequate alone time is essential to decompress. When my empath patients go nonstop in their jobs or as parents – without periodically slowing down – they risk chronic exhaustion, anxiety and overwhelm. Scheduling mini-breaks in your life to take a few deep breaths, spending some quiet time without phone calls, demands or over-stimulation, taking a walk or meditating for even a few minutes will break the momentum of stress and prevent sensory overload.
Also I teach all my patients that "no is a complete sentence."
Q: Shouldn't we all try to be better listeners and responders to those going through hard times?
Orloff: Being a caring listener is one of the great empathic gifts we can give others. But we don't have to listen for hours on end to be effective. Giving someone your caring attention for five to 10 minutes can be very potent, as opposed to getting hooked into repetitive two-hour phone conversations that wear you out. "I love you and I will be thinking of you" is a wonderful thing to say after responding to the person for a limited time. Also, I recommend having short check-ins with the person. A technique I suggest in "Thriving as an Empath" is the "3 Minute Phone Call." This is when you tell the person you're available for this period of time and you want to support them.
As an empathic person, you adore giving, but what I hope my book will provide you with are strategies to give in healthy ways – but also practice self-care so you can be a balanced, happy person.

Texto completo: On the jacket of my copy of "Acid Test," a 1963 collection of essays by John Simon, a blurb reads: "When Simon writes about a book, you will want to read it or you will not need to read it." Praise for a culture critic doesn't get much higher than that.
Simon died Sunday at the age of 94. We met once, briefly, almost 20 years ago, but I didn't know him. At the time he was still writing for National Review, among other publications, and I was moonlighting as a film critic for the New York Sun. I enjoyed reading film criticism almost as much as I enjoyed watching films, and Simon was far and away my favorite -- not because I necessarily agreed with his opinions but because he made me reflect on my own.
English was Simon's fifth language, and his knowledge of art, poetry and literature was at least as deep as his knowledge of film. But it wasn't simply erudition and versatility that distinguished his writing in the 1960s and '70s, a period widely regarded as the heyday of film criticism. It was also his approach to criticism itself, which included unfailingly high standards and a brutal honesty that wasn't always appreciated by actors and filmmakers, never mind his fellow critics.
Simon argued that film criticism was much like any other kind of criticism. His job was not to indulge the people who make films or even the people who watch them. "It is not for the critic to do the reader's thinking for him; it is for the critic to do his own thinking for the reader's benefit," he wrote. He often was accused of being overly harsh in his assessments, but to his mind it was his fellow critics who were overly generous. Long before Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert helped reduce film criticism to "thumbs up" or "thumbs down," Simon was sounding the alarm. His worry was that critical indifference to bad art, or insufficient opposition to it, would "give rise to further bad art and drive out the good."
Simon sometimes reviewed not only the movie but other reviews of the movie. A good example is his take on Brian DePalma's 1980 film, "Dressed to Kill," which was popular with critics and audiences alike. Simon was having none of it.
He begins his review by citing what he considered excessive praise of the film from the likes of Pauline Kael, who wrote, "It is hardly possible to find a point at which you could tear yourself away from this picture." Next, Simon notes the long lines outside cinemas that were showing the movie, which disappointed him. Finally, we get his own summary of the movie, which offers up little more than "sophomoric soft-core pornography, vulgar manipulation of the emotions for more sensation, salacious but inept dialogue that is a cross between comic-strip Freudianism and sniggering double entendres, and a plot line so full of holes as to be at best a dotted line." And that's just the first paragraph.
Simon's uncompromising judgments translated into a ton of negative reviews of movies and performances, and in a career that spanned more than five decades it's hardly surprising that some of them don't hold up very well. For better or worse, society's tastes have proven to be more malleable than Simon's. He dismissed "The Godfather" as "one of the sleazier films to achieve overwhelming public, and considerable critical, success." He described Diane Keaton as "supremely untalented." And he had no use for "The Graduate," bristling at its "oversimplification, overelaboration, inconsistency, eclecticism, obviousness, pretentiousness" and "rock bottom" soundtrack. Somewhere, Simon and Garfunkel are probably still laughing at that one.
According to the New York Times, his 1972 collection, "Reverse Angle," discusses 245 films and recommends 15 of them. But then, cultural criticism for Simon was never a popularity contest. As he put it: "Critics are after something far more elusive: pursuing their own reactions down to the rock bottom of their subjectivity and expressing them with utmost artistry, so that what will always elude the test of objective truth will at least become a kind of art: the art of illumination, persuasion, and good thinking and writing."
Simon was still writing to the end. His final post on his blog is dated Oct. 27, and there's no indication that he'd gone soft in his dotage. "One person's critic is another person's crackpot," he wrote. "I myself prefer being considered a creep, but that is what you get for having what Vladimir Nabokov called 'Strong Opinions.'"
Fortunately, we still have other cultural critics -- Kyle Smith, Armond White, Bruce Bawer, James Bowman, Stanley Crouch -- who share Simon's willingness to go it alone, come what may. Unfortunately, we have lost the leader of the pack.

Texto completo: He brought his sons to the U.S. while his wife and daughter waited in the Dominican Republic. Now reunited, they are making up for lost time.
Five years ago, Henry and Oscabel Casilla sat in their house in the Dominican Republic and made a plan. They would split up their family temporarily, with the hope of reuniting in the United States in the future.
Ms. Casilla, who was then Mr. Casilla's girlfriend, stayed with their daughter, Osmarlin, in Puerto Plata. Mr. Casilla moved with their two sons, Hanle and Albert, to New York in 2014.
Mr. Casilla, 45, had received residency documents for himself and his sons through his father, who is a United States citizen. The plan was to establish himself in America and then return to the Dominican Republic and marry Ms. Casilla.
Nine months later, however, that plan was thrown into chaos.
One evening, Mr. Casilla made a frantic call to Ms. Casilla and explained that the boys had been put into foster care.
"When he told me that they had taken away our children, it felt like the world came crashing down on top of me," Ms. Casilla, 36, said in Spanish in a recent interview at the family's home in Washington Heights. "I wasn't there, I didn't know the system or what was really happening. It nearly killed me."
Shortly after arriving in New York, Mr. Casilla was notified by Albert's school that he was misbehaving in class. Mr. Casilla sometimes used corporal punishment to discipline him, striking him on the legs with a belt. After a nurse at Albert's school noticed a bruise, she notified the city's Administration for Children's Services and the two boys were removed from school the same day and placed in foster care services run by Children's Aid.
"I was in complete despair," said Mr. Casilla, who was unfamiliar with the city agencies and spoke little English.
The authorities discovered that Mr. Casilla had a clean record, that he rarely used corporal punishment, and that he did not understand its repercussions. His sons were returned to him two weeks later. He completed parenting and anger management classes over the course of a few months in 2015.
During home visits, caseworkers noticed that Mr. Casilla was struggling to provide for his family, and Children's Aid, one of the seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, contributed $ 1,650 from The Fund for gift certificates to buy clothing and food for Mr. Casilla and his sons. Mr. Casilla and his family were profiled by The New York Times in 2015.
For Mr. Casilla, the incident four years ago was "one that continues to unfold" he said. "It continues to make me think and pushes me to always do things correctly."
In 2016, Mr. Casilla traveled back to the Dominican Republic to marry Ms. Casilla. The following year, Ms. Casilla and Osmarlin moved to New York.
"The day I saw my family together was one of the happiest of my life" Ms. Casilla said. "All I wanted, for all those years, was to find us a little nest where the five of us could be together again."
The Casillas initially lived in a rented room in an apartment on Davidson Avenue in the Bronx. Mr. Casilla, who earns $ 2,400 a month working early mornings as a construction worker, and Ms. Casilla, who earns around $ 1,400 a month working a late shift in the housekeeping department at Manhattan College, saved $ 7,000 to pay a security deposit and a few months' rent upfront for a one-bedroom apartment in Washington Heights.
The family moved into the apartment in May of this year, but the steep move-in costs exhausted their savings. Children's Aid then provided $ 500 in gift cards for groceries and $ 200 for household supplies, and purchased furniture worth $ 1,800. The agency also recently bought a computer for the family worth $ 559.97.
The five members of the Casilla family agreed that the apartment is more comfortable than their previous living arrangements. They said they are proud "hogareños," or homebodies, spending their weekends as a unit -- telling stories, cooking and visiting nearby relatives.
"I prefer to spend the little free time I have with my family here," Ms. Casilla said, "because I feel like I lost those three years with them."
Looking back now, the family said the experience of living apart and facing troubles as they adjusted to life in New York City made them stronger.
"Our story is one of resilience," said Hanle, 19, now a freshman at Borough of Manhattan Community College. "We adapted to a new country, taking on all the customs here, and understanding the system. We've faced all these problems, and look at how we developed over the last four years. We recovered so quickly."
Hanle is studying to be a psychologist, in part, he said, "because I can understand why people do what they do, and I have a sensitivity to understand other people's problems."
Albert, 16, is now a junior in high school. In his free time, he writes, sings and produces his own rap music, in which he tells stories about his life. Osmarlin, 9, who misses the warm weather of Puerto Plata, is in the third grade and wants to be a fashion designer.
Mr. Casilla said he is working on moving the family into a larger apartment so his children can have their own rooms. Currently, Hanle, Albert and Osmarlin share the living room, which they have divided in two.
The family is not ashamed of the events of four years ago, saying that they hope their story can be an example to others about the importance and benefits of keeping a family united.
"The storm has passed and we're enjoying the calm," Ms. Casilla said. "I thank God that we're all together again. It feels beautiful."
Donations to the Neediest Cases may be made online, or with a check or over the phone.

Texto completo: 'It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.' So George Orwell opened his novel '1984,' on a weird and chilling note. The reader wonders: Does anyone notice something wrong?
Across China, clocks are striking thirteen. But unlike the sheeple of Orwell's grim prophecy, thousands of freedom-loving Chinese are awakening to the ominous chime and rising against Big Brother.
China's communist government is increasingly brazen about creating a massive surveillance state, in which millions of cameras track every person's whereabouts, every purchase is recorded in state databanks, every keystroke on the strictly controlled Chinese Internet is scrutinized. Powered by facial recognition software and other tools of artificial intelligence, this tireless web of watchers aims to control all that is done and said " even thought " inside the rapidly rising superpower.
Citizens of Hong Kong see clearly what Beijing is up to. When a new bill was announced this year that would permit accused criminals to be extradited from the city into the clutches of the regime " on whatever manufactured charges the government might invent " an uprising began that continues to gain steam. On Sunday, pro-democracy voters turned out in record numbers to oust communists from their local district councils.
The regime of Xi Jinping had wagered that Hong Kong's wealthy majority would be content to trade human rights for cold, hard cash in the form of business as usual in the high-rise office suites. Instead, despite the near-daily protests and violent clashes that have sent the city into a recession, they cast their ballots for more disruption. Why? Because they hear the clocks striking thirteen.
Xi faces the most significant challenge of his power-grabbing career. Having moved to reassert the Communist Party's dominion over a rapidly modernizing nation, he now sees China's most modern territory fighting back. The protests in Hong Kong " and even more important, the pro-democracy landslide " vindicate the tattered faith that progress and freedom go hand-in-hand. It is a faith that strikes directly at the dark heart of one-party tyranny.
For a government that prides itself on careful strategic steps, the extradition bill has been a bungle of epic proportion. Not only has the attempted overreach roused the people of Hong Kong; their example will be noted in Shanghai, Shenzhen and even Beijing itself. Moreover, years of progress toward the party's cherished goal of the reabsorption of Taiwan has been derailed. Everywhere, people who might have resigned themselves to dictatorship now realize that liberty has more support than they had dared to hope.
That awakening may shed light on the extraordinary leaks in recent days of secret government documents. The two troves, published by the New York Times and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, add up to one of the largest security breaches in Chinese Communist Party history. Together, they provide a detailed account of China's most advanced experiment in high-tech oppression so far: the imprisonment of 1 million or more ethnic Uighurs in western China with the purpose of erasing their Muslim heritage.
On the pretext of fighting terrorism, the Xi regime has employed 'the powerful fist of the People's Democratic Dictatorship' (in the boastful words of the program's architect) to round up men, women and children for 'training' in concentration camps. According to an Associated Press examination of the consortium's trove, 'one document explicitly states that the purpose of the pervasive digital surveillance is 'to prevent problems before they happen' " in other words, to calculate who might rebel and detain them before they have a chance.'
The AP quotes Rian Thum of the University of Nottingham: 'There's no other place in the world where a computer can send you to an internment camp.'
These leaks let the outside world know that liberty has friends even inside the Chinese government. Some unknown number of officials with access to the dirty secrets of the ruling party is willing to risk their lives to resist Big Brother. The spirit of freedom is not limited to the Hong Kong frontier.
A nearly unanimous U.S. Congress has recognized the historic nature of events in China by reaffirming the U.S. commitment to guard human rights in Hong Kong. Unfortunately, President Trump is waffling, fearful that a strong stand for freedom could irritate Xi and thus scotch the trade deal Trump so desperately needs. 'We have to stand with Hong Kong,' he allowed grudgingly, 'but I'm also standing with President Xi. He's a friend of mine.'
The president's soft spot for tyrants is old news by now. Sad. But his personal friendships must not interfere with his duty to faithfully execute his office. The United States is the friend of liberty wherever brave souls dare to seek it. Deliver that message, Mr. President, while there is still time.

Report: Trump knew about whistleblower complaint before releasing aid to Ukraine

Texto completo: President Trump was briefed of the whistleblower complaint that forms the basis of the House impeachment proceedings before he released aid to Ukraine.
A CIA whistleblower filed a complaint alleging that Trump attempted to push Ukraine into investigating former Vice President Joe Biden to secure a political advantage over the Democrat ahead of the 2020 presidential election. The whistleblower alleged that Trump made a deal with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to launch the investigation in return for United States military aid in a July 25 phone call.
House Democrats have used the whistleblower complaint as the basis to launch an impeachment investigation. Several of Trump’s GOP defenders in the House have pointed out that Trump released aid to Ukraine without any reciprocal investigations as evidence that no deal was struck.
A Tuesday report from the New York Times calls into question whether Trump released the aid to Ukraine because he was worried about the complaint or because his administration was reasonably assured by that point that Ukraine’s government would not waste the U.S. aid.
The Office of Legal Counsel briefed the president on the complaint as White House lawyers attempted to determine if they were required by law to hand the complaint over to Congress. The OLC eventually decided that it was not obligated to give the complaint to Congress. It is unclear how much Trump knew about the complaint and if he was briefed on the specific allegations it contained.
Reports suggest that the anonymous whistleblower is 33-year-old CIA analyst Eric Ciaramella but have not yet been confirmed. Ciaramella was Ukraine director on the National Security Council during the end of the Obama administration and remained there during the early months of the Trump administration when he was briefly acting senior director for European and Russian affairs.
The Washington Examiner reported that Ciaramella is now a deputy national intelligence officer for Russia and Eurasia on the National Intelligence Council, reporting to the director of national intelligence.

Texto completo: Two-thirds of people in six battleground states who voted for President Trump in 2016 but Democrats in the 2018 midterms are returning to the president for 2020, according to a surprising new poll.
The New York Times Upshot/Siena College survey found that many of those who left the GOP last year are returning to Trump because they feel good about the economy.
The Times write-up cautioned, “This group is only a sliver of the electorate — 2 percent of registered voters — and is not representative of all voters. They are overwhelmingly white, 60 percent are male, and two-thirds have no college degree. But the president’s strength among them helps explain why he is highly competitive in states that Democrats carried just one year ago.”
The newspaper quoted seven voters who said they stand ready to vote Trump back into office — even those who voted for Hillary Clinton. “7 percent of those who supported Mrs. Clinton in 2016 said they now approved of the president’s performance — despite his personality and his Twitter account, many said,” according to the Times.
The reasons many of those quoted gave for choosing Trump over the eventual Democratic nominee sound like a Trump campaign ad.
The analysis cited Michael Townsend, 38, a lifelong Democrat and construction worker in Dunmore, Pennsylvania, who voted for Trump but then Democrats in 2018. “I’ve been in construction 21 years, and the last two years were the best years I’ve ever had,” he said.
In the Clinton camp was Juli Anna California, a 57-year-old Florida nurse. But in 2020 she’s changing. “[Trump's] not exactly the person I’d have as my best friend,” she told the Times. “But he’s a great president. Most politicians just talk about doing things, but Trump does them.”
And Matthew Headley, a Michigan general contractor and pizza business owner, echoed what the GOP has been saying about the House impeachment probe. “The harder [Democrats are] going after Trump, the more they’re just alienating people and pushing them away,” he said.

Ross Douthat: Don’t blame social media for the populist movement

Texto completo: Social media is bad for everything and everybody, for humans and journalists and other living things. But at least it reliably generates interesting juxtapositions from which op-ed columns can be made — including columns about how a fixation on, well, social media, is damaging liberalism’s understanding of the world.
The relevant juxtaposition comes from my Twitter feed, which Friday featured — to great acclaim and many retweets — a speech by Sacha Baron Cohen, the erstwhile fake newsman Borat, condemning “a handful of internet companies” for building the “greatest propaganda machine in history” and driving the rise of authoritarianism, demagoguery and bigotry.
At the same time, Twitter also surfaced a recent study from academics in France, Canada and the United States that examined the relationship between social media echo chambers and support for populism in France, Britain and the United States. The authors found that there was either no relationship or a negative one: Populist voters were somewhat more likely to hang out with people of a similar ethnicity or social class offline, but on the internet they were no more likely than other voters to inhabit an echo chamber. And social media use was a strong predictor of opposition to the campaign of President Donald Trump.
This is not the first study to question social media’s supposedly central role in the drama of right-wing populism. Shortly after Trump’s election, economists at Brown and Stanford found that he performed more poorly than Mitt Romney and John McCain among Americans who get their news online, while the voters he converted were often the very off line.
This kind of evidence doesn’t mean that online conspiracy mongering has no influence on populism. People who rarely use the internet might be more easily deceived by fake headlines when they do wander online. Normal partisans may get kookier under the sustained influence of the memeplex. And Cohen is right that small communities of depraved people, from pedophiles to anti-Semites, use online platforms in vicious ways — and internet giants invoke free expression while shirking their responsibility to deny such viciousness a refuge.
But we should be more doubtful of Cohen’s larger narrative, which is commonplace among progressives — a narrative that invokes the “sewer” of social media to explain everything from climate change skepticism to anti-immigration sentiment, portrays Russian trolls and YouTube stars as the crucial actors of the populist era, and proposes the regulation of online speech as the main restorative that the liberal order needs.
Instead, the evidence in the papers cited above hints at a different scenario — in which because educated liberalism is increasingly so very online itself, ensconced in its own self-reinforcing information bubble, liberals end up analyzing populism exclusively through their digital experience even when that analysis is obviously insufficient.
In a recent Boston Review essay, Tufts political scientist Eitan Hersh notes that many American liberals participate in politics through a kind of uber-online “political hobbyism” in which real-world organizing recedes in favor of constant engagement “from behind screens or with earphones on.”
Inside this hobbyist’s world, the centrality of those screens becomes a given. Spend all your time on Twitter and Facebook, and it seems that Twitter and Facebook must be essential to the far right’s appeal and that a better social media ecosystem would suffice to deal with Trump, suppress Marine Le Pen or sideline Nigel Farage.
But if the other side is actually less online than you are, this assumption leads to two mistakes. First, you end up downgrading the obvious real-world forces driving populism’s appeal, persuading yourself that an algorithmic tweak or better fact-checking will deal with deep trends — economic stagnation, social crisis — that would exist with or without fake news.
Second, you lose sight of the ways in which your own information bubble is a potential radicalizing force — including for people observing it from outside, for whom it makes political liberalism seem like an airless world filled with hypereducated ideologues. Indeed, on the evidence of a Democratic primary that seems made for the social media bubble, it’s liberalism that’s being warped by online feedback loops and radicalization cascades.
Which is not to say that conservatism isn’t pretty warped at the moment or that social media has been good for right-wing decency and common sense. (Remember where I began: It’s bad for everything.) But what’s wrong with conservatism has as much to do with old media forces like talk radio and cable news, plus real-world isolation and disconnection, as it does with QAnon. Trump owes his (relative) resilience to the inertia of medium-information voters enjoying a decent economy, not to YouTube radicalism.
And if those voters are the battlefield, then any Democratic strategy will be insufficient unless liberalism realizes that before it regulates social media for other people, it should learn how to resist the internet itself.

Utah court upholds stop-and-frisk after challenge from Neo-Nazi

Texto completo: A neo-Nazi gang member in Utah has lost his legal challenge to the practice of stop-and-frisk in the state, after an appeals court ruled that police officers had justifiable cause to search him after he behaved belligerently during a traffic stop in 2017.
The man, Bryant Robert Mitchell, was arrested in July 2017 after the police searched him during a traffic stop and found he was carrying heroin and a knife, which he was barred from having because he was a felon. He later pleaded guilty to drug possession with intent to distribute and was sentenced to five years to life in prison.
But before his trial, Mitchell’s lawyer filed a motion to suppress the evidence in the case, arguing that officers did not have reason to search him during the stop. Prosecutors argued that the search was reasonable because officers saw Mitchell shouting expletives at a bystander and knew him to be a member of a white supremacist gang, the Soldiers of Aryan Culture.
A district court agreed in May 2018, and on Friday, the Utah Court of Appeals concurred, although it said the case was “close.”
“Mitchell’s status as a member of SAC is not enough by itself, and neither is Mitchell’s profane salutation toward the individual in the parking lot,” the court wrote in its ruling.
“But under the unique circumstances of this case,” the court continued, “those two factors, viewed together, gave rise to a reasonable suspicion that Mitchell might be armed — after all, he was a member of a violent gang and the officers reasonably believed that he was acting aggressively toward, and about to start a physical altercation with, a bystander.”
A lawyer for Mitchell did not respond to a message seeking comment Monday.
The appeals court described Mitchell’s case as a justifiable example of stop-and-frisk, an aggressive policing tactic that was ended in New York City after a judge ruled that it violated the constitutional rights of black and Latino people, who were disproportionately stopped. The program gave police officers sweeping authority to stop and search anyone they suspected of a crime.
The practice re-entered the national spotlight last week after Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York who is now running for the Democratic presidential nomination, apologized for his long-standing support of the strategy. The Supreme Court ruled in the 1968 case Terry v. Ohio that the practice is not unconstitutional if the police officer involved has reason to believe that the person stopped is armed and dangerous.
Mitchell’s encounter with the police began when officers pulled over a 1982 Chevrolet Blazer in Ogden, Utah, that made two turns without signaling, according to court documents. The officers began to follow the car and decided to make a traffic stop after they checked its license plate number and found the car to be uninsured, which the appeals court said was a sound reason to make the stop.
But Mitchell argued that it was not reasonable for officers to believe he was armed and dangerous because he was wearing only a pair of shorts, leaving him few places to conceal a weapon. He also did not have his hands in his pockets and he complied with all the officers’ commands, according to court documents. During the search, officers found the knife and the heroin in his pockets.
At the time of the traffic stop, Mitchell was standing up in the front seat of the car and shouting a “profane salutation” at a man in a convenience store parking lot, according to court documents. His upper body and face are covered in neo-Nazi tattoos, including a swastika wrapped around an iron cross on the back of his head; a code for “Heil Hitler” tattooed in large print on his stomach; and the number “187,” the California Penal Code section for murder, tattooed on his face.
During the stop, officers also arrested another passenger in the car who had an outstanding arrest warrant, which the court said gave the officers increased reason to believe Mitchell could pose a danger.
“When we consider the circumstances of this case in their totality, we are persuaded that the officers had reasonable suspicion that Mitchell might be armed and dangerous, and were therefore justified in conducting a Terry frisk,” the court wrote.

John Simon Had No Time for Bad Art; The critic, who died Sunday at 94, worried that critical indifference would give rise to more of it.

Texto completo: On the jacket of my copy of "Acid Test," a 1963 collection of essays by John Simon, a blurb reads: "When Simon writes about a book, you will want to read it or you will not need to read it." Praise for a culture critic doesn't get much higher than that.
Simon died Sunday at the age of 94. We met once, briefly, almost 20 years ago, but I didn't know him. At the time he was still writing for National Review, among other publications, and I was moonlighting as a film critic for the New York Sun. I enjoyed reading film criticism almost as much as I enjoyed watching films, and Simon was far and away my favorite—not because I necessarily agreed with his opinions but because he made me reflect on my own.
English was Simon's fifth language, and his knowledge of art, poetry and literature was at least as deep as his knowledge of film. But it wasn't simply erudition and versatility that distinguished his writing in the 1960s and '70s, a period widely regarded as the heyday of film criticism. It was also his approach to criticism itself, which included unfailingly high standards and a brutal honesty that wasn't always appreciated by actors and filmmakers, never mind his fellow critics.
Simon argued that film criticism was much like any other kind of criticism. His job was not to indulge the people who make films or even the people who watch them. "It is not for the critic to do the reader's thinking for him; it is for the critic to do his own thinking for the reader's benefit," he wrote. He often was accused of being overly harsh in his assessments, but to his mind it was his fellow critics who were overly generous. Long before Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert helped reduce film criticism to "thumbs up" or "thumbs down," Simon was sounding the alarm. His worry was that critical indifference to bad art, or insufficient opposition to it, would "give rise to further bad art and drive out the good."
Simon sometimes reviewed not only the movie but other reviews of the movie. A good example is his take on Brian DePalma's 1980 film, "Dress to Kill," which was popular with critics and audiences alike. Simon was having none of it.
He begins his review by citing what he considered excessive praise of the film from the likes of Pauline Kael, who wrote, "It is hardly possible to find a point at which you could tear yourself away from this picture." Next, Simon notes the long lines outside cinemas that were showing the movie, which disappointed him. Finally, we get his own summary of the movie, which offers up little more than "sophomoric soft-core pornography, vulgar manipulation of the emotions for more sensation, salacious but inept dialogue that is a cross between comic-strip Freudianism and sniggering double entendres, and a plot line so full of holes as to be at best a dotted line." And that's just the first paragraph.
Simon's uncompromising judgments translated into a ton of negative reviews of movies and performances, and in a career that spanned more than five decades it's hardly surprising that some of them don't hold up very well. For better or worse, society's tastes have proven to be more malleable than Simon's. He dismissed "The Godfather" as "one of the sleazier films to achieve overwhelming public, and considerable critical, success." He described Diane Keaton as "supremely untalented." And he had no use for "The Graduate," bristling at its "oversimplification, overelaboration, inconsistency, eclecticism, obviousness, pretentiousness" and "rock bottom" soundtrack. Somewhere, Simon and Garfunkel are probably still laughing at that one.
According to the New York Times, his 1972 collection, "Reverse Angle," discusses 245 films and recommends 15 of them. But then, cultural criticism for Simon was never a popularity contest. As he put it: "Critics are after something far more elusive: pursuing their own reactions down to the rock bottom of their subjectivity and expressing them with utmost artistry, so that what will always elude the test of objective truth will at least become a kind of art: the art of illumination, persuasion, and good thinking and writing."
Simon was still writing to the end. His final post on his blog is dated Oct. 27, and there's no indication that he'd gone soft in his dotage. "One person's critic is another person's crackpot," he wrote. "I myself prefer being considered a creep, but that is what you get for having what Vladimir Nabokov called 'Strong Opinions.' "
Fortunately, we still have other cultural critics—Kyle Smith, Armond White, Bruce Bawer, James Bowman, Stanley Crouch—who share Simon's willingness to go it alone, come what may. Unfortunately, we have lost the leader of the pack.

Barriers of all kinds zigzag across America like a scar

Texto completo: A few words about walls.
The one Donald Trump is trying to build on the southern border has proven, like most things he touches, an embarrassing failure. First came news early this month that smugglers have been able to cut through the barrier with a reciprocating saw, available at Home Depot for prices starting at less than $100. Then, TBS' "Full Frontal with Samantha Bee" aired a segment demonstrating that the wall, which Trump has said "can't be climbed," can actually be climbed in as little as 15 seconds and by climbers as young as 8.
In the meantime, and with much less fanfare, construction continues on a wall of much further-reaching consequences. You see, while the wall on the border is supposed to repel immigrants and smugglers, this one repels something many of us find even more threatening: contradictory opinions.
This speaks to barriers of intellectual — and emotional — separation that now zigzag across America like a scar, splitting towns, colleges, churches, workplaces, friendships and families. Nor is the barrier only being built from one side. As liberal college students demand "safe spaces" and "trigger warnings" so they won't have to confront contradiction of their beliefs, it becomes painfully clear this wall is a bipartisan project. And that should concern us all.
This is no argument for false equivalence, nor even for civility. But it is an argument for intellectual freedom — for honoring people's sacred right to speak and to hear.
The genius of America has always been that it believed in the marketplace of ideas, believed we should have access to the broadest possible range, and that if we did, we would, more often than not, choose the good over the bad, the right over the wrong, the intelligent over the stupid.
Yes, that trust has been sorely tested lately, but is the answer to abandon it completely? To do so would be to abandon everything that makes this country worth the trouble. To do so would be craven and un-American. As in commissioners of a podunk Florida county defending its citizens from The New York Times.
One doesn't know whether to laugh or cry. That wall Trump is trying to build against immigrants will go down as an expensive boondoggle. But you know what will cost us more in the long run?
Any wall we build against ourselves.

Texto completo: Billionaire Michael R. Bloomberg announced his run for president on Sunday and immediately demonstrated the power of his wealth by launching a massive television ad campaign that cost tens of millions of dollars.
The former New York mayor joins a crowded field of Democrats that has been jostling for months over the direction of the party and who is best positioned to take on President Trump next year. He has already been attacked by his rivals over his wealth and has fended off accusations that he is trying to buy the election. Bloomberg's affluence is the primary reason his candidacy is getting the attention it is.
Here's a look at the man, the money and the message:

--
Who is Michael R. Bloomberg?
Bloomberg, 77, is a businessman and the former three-term mayor of New York. His estimated net worth is $54 billion, making Bloomberg one of the richest men in the world. He has spent large amounts of money on his favored political causes, such as fighting climate change and supporting education reform. In 2018, he donated $95 million to federal candidates, political parties and committees.
Bloomberg previously flirted with and ruled out presidential runs, including earlier this year. But on Sunday he publicly declared his candidacy as a Democrat and began a $37-million weeklong ad blitz that same morning.
--
How did Bloomberg make his money?
After graduating from Harvard Business School, Bloomberg went to work as a Wall Street banker at Salomon Brothers. He eventually made partner, but was laid off in 1981.
He owned $10 million worth of equity in the firm, which he used to start a business that provided news, analytics and data to financial companies through terminals at a premium cost. The company, which was named after its founder, grew to include a news wire service, radio stations and other media.
--
How much does he plan to spend on his campaign?
"Whatever it takes to defeat Donald Trump," Bloomberg advisor Howard Wolfson told CNBC.
--
Do his campaigns for mayor offer any clues?
They most certainly do. Bloomberg spent at least $268 million altogether on his three mayoral campaigns, according to the New York Times.
--
How do self-financing candidates tend to do?
Just ask California Gov. Meg Whitman or Presidents Ross Perot and Steve Forbes.
The answer is, poorly. There is a long list of wealthy candidates of both parties who made a lot of political consultants rich but failed to win office.
Perot, who ran as an independent in 1992 and Forbes as a Republican in 2000, each spent the equivalent of a little over $110 million in today's dollars, modern-day records. Bloomberg and Tom Steyer could easily break those records if they keep spending at the same pace. In the 2010 gubernatorial race, Whitman, a Republican, spent a record-breaking $144 million of her own money -- and lost to Democrat Jerry Brown by 13 points.
There are exceptions -- Democrat J.B. Pritzker shattered Whitman's record by spending $171.5 million of his fortune on his successful 2018 campaign for Illinois governor. Republican Rick Scott spent $63.6 million of his own money to become a U.S. senator representing Florida that same year.
The question is whether Bloomberg will prove the exception or the rule.
--
Doesn't the 2020 Democratic field already have a self-financing billionaire?
Yes -- see California's very own hedge-fund-manager turned environmental activist Steyer. In the first three months Steyer was in the race, he spent $47 million largely to meet donor and polling qualifications to appear on the Democratic debate stage. He has spent untold millions of dollars since then, but remains a low-single-digit afterthought in the polls.
Steyer has a fraction of Bloomberg's wealth.
--
Is Bloomberg really a Democrat?
Bloomberg is a registered Democrat. But his party registration has changed over the years. Until he ran for mayor in 2001, Bloomberg was a Democrat. That year, he changed his registration to Republican. Then in 2007 -- two years after he won his second mayoral term -- Bloomberg registered as an independent. Then, shortly before the midterm election in 2018, Bloomberg again registered as a Democrat.
Bloomberg isn't the only candidate who was once a Republican. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts was a registered Republican until the mid-1990s, a point that has been criticized by former Vice President Joe Biden.
--
Why is Bloomberg running for president?
A top advisor said this month that Bloomberg had grown increasingly worried that no one in the Democratic field -- more than a dozen candidates before Bloomberg jumped into the race -- would be able to defeat Trump.
Bloomberg's decision also comes after months of questions about Biden's shaky front-runner status, and at a time two other candidates at the top of the polls -- Sens. Warren and Bernie Sanders of Vermont -- offer economic policy that Bloomberg finds entirely too liberal. (Earlier this year he invoked the crisis in Venezuela as he trashed Warren's wealth tax proposal.)
--
Does Bloomberg's late entry to the race hurt his chances?
The rest of the Democratic field has been courting voters for months, answering questions at town halls and visiting coffee shops in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. Those four states are the first to vote for the presidential nominees in both parties, giving their voters outsized influence.
Bloomberg has already conceded that he entered the contest too late to compete in those states, so instead he plans to focus on Super Tuesday, when more than a dozen states including California hold their primary elections.
Bloomberg's unusual strategy comes with many challenges. He will have to blunt the momentum of candidates who do well in the early states, while simultaneously campaigning in multiple states with expensive media markets.
But Bloomberg, with an unlimited campaign war chest, can do something no candidate has done previously -- mount an all-out coast-to-coast television campaign.
--
Aside from entering the race late, does Bloomberg face other obstacles?
Many.
Bloomberg's campaign website brags about the decrease in crime in New York City while he was mayor. But a pillar of his administration's approach was stop-and-frisk, a policing technique that has been widely blamed for racial profiling of black and brown residents. Bloomberg stood by the policy until last weekend, when he apologized for it at an African American church. Successful Democratic presidential candidates need the support of minority voters in primary and general elections.
Bloomberg has a history of making crude remarks about women, both in business and when he was mayor. A Bloomberg spokesman told the New York Times this month that the billionaire now views some of his past statements as "disrespectful and wrong." These chapters of his life -- notably on Wall Street during the 1970s and 1980s -- are certain to be reexamined in the post #MeToo era.
Bloomberg's business ties will also be under the microscope -- already, media critics are outraged because the editor in chief of Bloomberg News announced over the weekend that its reporters would not scrutinize Bloomberg's wealth, foundation or family nor those of his Democratic rivals as they continued investigating the Trump administration.
In addition, Bloomberg's fortune is a particular problem in this year's election, when much of the Democratic debate is about income inequality, the gap between the haves and have-nots, and the ability of the rich to use loopholes to aggregate more and more of the nation's wealth.

Texto completo: Peter A. Mobilia, Jr., 70, of Windsor and formerly Hartford, passed away on Thursday, November 21, 2019 at St. Francis Hospital after a brief illness. Born in Hartford on October 18, 1949, he was a son of the late Peter A. Mobilia, Sr. and the late Mildred (Montano) Mobilia. He is survived by his brother, Dominic A. Mobilia of Bloomfield and was predeceased by his sister-in-law, Barbara F. Mobilia. Peter was a graduate of Emerson College, Boston, where he earned a Bachelor of Science in Speech degree, majoring in mass communications. He retired in 2012 as a member of the public relations staff at St. Francis Hospital and Medical Center, Hartford after a 25-year career at that institution. Previously, he spent 19 years as a radio and television broadcaster, most recently serving as chief correspondent at WPOP News Radio 14, Hartford. While at WPOP, his 1984 documentary on the 40th anniversary of the Hartford Circus Fire, "Someone Yelled Fire!," received awards from the Associated Press, United Press International and the Connecticut Society of Professional Journalists. Since then, the broadcast has been cited as a reference in at least two books on the 1944 circus fire, the worst disaster in the history of Hartford. While serving as executive news producer at KGBT-TV in Harlingen, Texas, his documentary on what was, at the time, the world's largest oil spill, "The Saga of Ixtoc Uno," received the Texas Association of Broadcasters' award for distinguished local programming in the public interest. A video tape of the broadcast was subsequently accepted for the permanent collection at the Museum of Broadcasting in New York. He also served as an adjunct professor of broadcast journalism at the University of Hartford and was a free-lance contributor to the New York Times Connecticut Weekly section. Peter was a founding board member of Fresh Start Pallet Products, a community initiative which employs economically disadvantaged Hartford residents in building furniture from discarded wooden shipping pallets.
Graveside services will be held on Wednesday, November 27th at 10:15 a.m. at Mt. Saint Benedict Cemetery (Section R), 1 Cottage Grove Road, Bloomfield. There are no calling hours. Donations in Peter's memory may be made to Saint Anthony's Guild, 144 West 32nd Street, New York, NY 10001-3202. The D'Esopo Funeral Chapel, Wethersfield has been entrusted with arrangements.

This is a paid death notice.

'Bizarre delicacy is cruel': De Blasio signs bill banning foie gras in NYC

Texto completo: Foie gras will soon be pulled from menus across New York City after Mayor Bill de Blasio signed legislation that bans sales of the French delicacy.
De Blasio signed the bill into law on Monday. It had been widely supported by the New York City Council, which voted overwhelmingly in favor of banning the food over concerns of animal cruelty. The ban will go into effect in 2022 and is expected to have an impact on the approximately 1,000 restaurants that serve the dish, according to the New York Times.
Foie gras, created through a process called gavage, is made from the liver of a duck or goose that is force-fed a fatty mixture through a tube inserted into its throat. During the 20-day feeding process, the bird’s liver becomes engorged for human consumption.
Allie Feldman Taylor, president of Voters for Animal Rights, hailed the decision.
“New York has sent a clear message to foie gras producers that shoving a foot-long pipe down a bird's throat and intentionally diseasing and enlarging their liver up to ten times its normal size in order to create some bizarre delicacy is cruel and has no place in our compassionate city,” Taylor said in a press release.
Marco Moreira, the executive chef and owner of French restaurant Tocqueville, criticized the law and said that it would damage the city’s fine dining scene.
“New York is the mecca of dining in the world. How is it possible that New York doesn’t have foie gras?” Moreira said. “What’s next? No more veal? No more mushrooms?”
California has also banned the sale of foie gras, and the Supreme Court upheld the legality of the decision in January. Other countries such as the United Kingdom, India, and Israel have also placed prohibitions on the food.
The new law will fine those who disobey the ban $2,000 for each violation.

Texto completo: Los globos gigantes del desfile del Día de Acción de Gracias de Macy’s podría ser suspendidos este año, debido a los fuertes vientos.
Expertos meteorológicos pronosticaron vientos helados sostenidos de 22 mph (unos 35 kilómetros por hora) y ráfagas de hasta de 39 mph (unos 39 kilómetros por hora) , que se concentrarían durante las horas que se realiza el desfile en Manhattan.
Según disposiciones locales, los globos no pueden ser elevados si los vientos sostenidos superan las 23 mph y las ráfagas superan los 34 mph.
Será hasta el jueves por mañana, el mismo día del desfile, cuando el gobierno de Bill de Blasio determine si es seguro elevar los globos, ya que las condiciones de los vientos proyectadas desde este lunes podrían cambiar en ese entonces.

Texto completo: My Mom died Tuesday. As much as I admire her 92 years of life, I remember as a kid thinking life had cheated her at times.
Lois Evaughn Schembs was born on a farm outside of Remington, Indiana, on Jan. 28, 1927, to farmer Jesse Schembs and his wife, Floretta Casey. Mom never said they were poor, but she did tell stories of running to the outhouse in the middle of winter nights and being happy to find a Sears catalog instead of just corn cobs. She’d heat an iron in the fire and use it to warm her bed sheets, but she’d still wake up some mornings to find the water frozen in her glass next to the bed.
She was so smart as a child, she skipped second grade. Then she got scarlet fever and missed so much school, she had to repeat third grade. Good in math and English, she was salutatorian of her Class of 1945 at Remington High School, where she also played the drums.
Of course, old classmates of hers just called her "the prettiest girl in school." They say she should have been queen of the Fountain Park Chautauqua in Remington, but the judges declared it a tie and Mom lost the coin flip.
Second in her class. Second to the queen. And second-class citizen when it came to education, I thought. College was never an option for her, so she took a job in bookkeeping with Sherman White and Co., a buyer of farm goods in Goodland. That’s where she met my dad, Willy Constable, on the day he came home from World War II and stopped by in uniform to see his sister, who introduced him to my mom. He was more than 10 years older, and Mom remembers being mortified when he wore his fedora on their first date to the movie theater, as if he were an old man.
Dad proposed on their third date. Three years later, Mom accepted. But first, she and her younger sister, Dorothy, crossed the Atlantic Ocean in the steerage compartment of a steamship for a grand adventure in Ireland. That took courage. Mom came home and married my dad on March 13, 1950, on what happened to be the first day in weeks that it was too wet for farmers to work. The last-second nuptials meant Willy’s father, Bert, skipped the wedding to attend his previously scheduled town board meeting. A rainy spring extended my parent’s honeymoon.
Mom gave birth to daughters Sally and Nancy, and then me and my brother, Bill. Mom insisted that all of us kids learn to play piano and sing alongside Dad and her in the choir at the Goodland Presbyterian Church. My sisters played organ and piano for church and countless weddings. My brother became a gifted musician and keyboard player who charmed crowds with his music. As the only person in my family who never got paid to perform music, I might be the only kid in history whose mother asked him to stop taking piano lessons. We both thought that was a good idea.
Mom and Dad were key members of the South Newton High School Production Company and got all of us kids interested in theater. They took us to Christmas concerts at Purdue University. They also had good seats for Boilermaker football games, where we’d wrap our feet in plastic bread wrappers to keep warm and Mom would open her stash of homemade chocolate-chip goodies only when our team needed her "third-down cookies." Her only attempt at athletics was standing on her head on her birthdays.
Mom quizzed us on current events and political news at supper and set up an Electoral College voting system for family decisions, with everybody getting votes depending on age. A parental bloc defeated any move by the minority children, but any split opened the door for new alliances. Mom filled our home with books, music, humor and love.
An avid reader, political junkie and crossword wiz, she used to quote from New York Times stories and talk about writing her own book. "I’d call it ‘Hamburger and Sex,’" she said. "Because I know hamburger, and I need sex to make it sell."
In addition to cooking our meals and running the household, Mom was the driving force in getting all four kids to go to college. But she didn’t just inspire her own kids. She had an uncanny ability to draw people to her and consider her their second mom. People confided in her about sexual issues, drugs, abuse, alcoholism and dreams.
She lived on a farm in a conservative, heavily Republican, all-white community, but became a go-to person for anyone from outside those boundaries. She and Dad visited Jimmy Carter’s church in Plains, Georgia. Mom and her friend Ruthann were once in a photo on the front of The Indianapolis Star talking with Jesse Jackson after they made the trip to hear the civil rights leader speak. Mom donated to Barack Obama, slapped an Obama bumper sticker on her car in 2008, and probably deserves credit for making Indiana a blue state that year. No one so much as teased her.
Once we kids were out of her hair, she focused more on herself. She and her friends had frequent Lunch Bunch outings.
In her 70s, she took art classes and became an accomplished watercolor artist, winning a couple of ribbons and landing one piece in a juried art show.
She got back to her drums, too, playing snare drum in the Newton Jasper Community Band from her early 70s through her late 80s.
Lovely and elegant are words often used in descriptions of her. Always polite, Mom never swore or spoke badly about anyone. She never let us kids say the S-word, whether that meant "stupid" or "shut up."
She cared for the old ladies in the church. She cared for her parents. She cared for my dad before he died in 2003. She cared for my brother before he died in 2010. She cared for others her whole life. My thoughts about what she could have been if she had been given the chance vanished. Life didn’t cheat her of opportunities. It let her forge her own.
She had grace, smarts, love and a wonderful life. And we were lucky to be part of it.

Texto completo: New York City is struggling to find a leader for its taxi regulator almost one year after the last chief announced her departure.
The continuing search for a new taxi and limousine commissioner coincides with a pivotal moment for the industry, which is in the midst of a financial crisis caused by a surge of ride-hailing vehicles and a collapse in yellow-taxi medallion values.
People familiar with the search say more than a half dozen people have declined formal and informal outreach from the administration, including outgoing Metropolitan Transportation Authority Managing Director Ronnie Hakim.
A spokeswoman for the mayor declined to comment on the outreach for the job search.
One person familiar with the search said prospective candidates have been put off for various reasons, including the intense public scrutiny and stress associated with the post. In July, City Council members blocked one nominee for the job after grilling the candidate over perceived past failings of the Taxi and Limousine Commission.
Mayor Bill de Blasio has taken his time to fill vacant posts, struggling to hire for important roles including the chair of the New York City Housing Authority and the deputy mayor for health and human services. Some commissioners work double duty, like Lorraine Grillo, who is in charge of the Department of Design and Construction and the School Construction Authority.
NYCHA had an interim chair, Department of Sanitation Commissioner Kathryn Garcia, for seven months until they found a permanent head.
The last taxi and limousine commissioner, Meera Joshi, announced her resignation in January and stepped down in March. Since then, the agency has been run by acting Commissioner Bill Heinzen.
Taxis and for-hire vehicles make about one million trips each day in New York City. The commission regulates the city's 13,500 yellow-cab medallions, the license to pick up street hails in Manhattan. It also oversees about 110,000 for-hire vehicles and about 190,000 drivers.
An influx of about 80,000 ride-hailing vehicles in recent years has driven down earnings across the industry.
The commission's role as regulator makes it and its leader a frequent target for criticism from drivers, medallion owners, livery companies, ride-hailing firms, City Council members and driver advocates. When Ms. Joshi attended a vigil for an Uber driver who killed himself in 2018, she was harangued by drivers and forced to leave.
Prospective candidates must assess their desire for the role knowing that they will likely be replaced in a little over two years when Mr. de Blasio leaves office. Mr. de Blasio also has a reputation for sometimes publicly contradicting his own agencies.
Last month, at an unrelated press conference, Mr. de Blasio said that his own Transportation Department's plan to adjust traffic on Fifth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan during the holiday season was premature. On Friday, he said the plan was going forward. Mr. de Blasio also publicly disagreed with Ms. Joshi over her opposition to a new state-imposed congestion charge on taxis and for-hire vehicles, which the then commissioner warned would hurt struggling drivers.
"The mayor holds city agencies to the highest standard to ensure we're accountable to New Yorkers," said a spokeswoman for the mayor.
The City Council blocked the nomination of Mr. de Blasio's recent pick to lead the agency, Jeffrey Roth. Mr. Roth, who is currently the deputy commissioner at the city's Department of Veterans' Services, was widely considered a solid pick for the agency. He previously served as a deputy commissioner at the TLC, where he oversaw policy formation and data analytics.
But Speaker Corey Johnson chastised Mr. Roth during a City Council confirmation hearing in July. Mr. Johnson, referring to articles in the New York Times about past corruption in the medallion industry, said that the regulator's new leader must confront its mistakes. He expressed frustration that Mr. Roth wasn't sufficiently forthcoming in his responses.
A spokesman for Mr. de Blasio said that the administration is still pushing for Mr. Roth for the post, among other people. "The Council should join us in supporting a clearly qualified candidate like Jeff who would protect cabdrivers from predatory agents and put the interests of New York City first," the spokesman, Will Baskin-Gerwitz, said.
Mr. Johnson appears unmoved. A spokeswoman for the speaker, Jennifer Fermino, said that the council takes its oversight role seriously. "We hope to meet a qualified candidate soon," she said.

J.P. Devine: A list of thanks for this Thanksgiving

Texto completo: While darkness clouds this moment in history with children being held in detention, and racism and antisemitism stalking the streets, a free press, brave service men and women and fair keepers of the law are things to be thankful for, writes J.P. Devine.
Thanksgiving. If you’re one of the lucky families in Maine, your son or daughter who has been serving in a branch of the armed forces may be sitting across from you and smiling as they pass the sweet potatoes. God bless that sight. Breathe in that moment; fill your lungs and your heart with it; and whisper it in the saying of grace.
If you’re equally blessed, you may be sitting across from a son or daughter home from college with heads full of social and political ideas. Your son’s ideas may mirror yours. Your daughter’s? Well, maybe they’re a bit scary, a tad AOC (Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez). That’s healthy.
That’s the spirit of Thanksgivings past. Once your grandparents argued about Roosevelt and the Depression, and the beat goes on.
Which brings to mind a Thanksgiving in New York, when a friend’s young son asked his grandfather the eternal question about World War II. “What did you do in the war, Grandpa?”
It may come to pass for you one day, when your children, your grandchildren will ask that question about this dark time in America’s political history. “What did you do in 2020, Grandpa, when you went to vote?”
But leaving that aside for now, I want to use my precious space this morning to share with you my list of thanks this Thanksgiving.
This year, I am, as I always have been, thankful to the great American free press, and that includes the newspapers of Maine and the company that employs me.
I am thankful to be able to read all the papers I choose to, words from all sides in the game. But especially the Washington Post, the group that courageously printed the Pentagon Papers and went on to bring down Richard Nixon. Today, Robert Costa and Dana Priest supplant Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward. And the beat goes on.
I download the New York Times that includes the works of Jodi Kantor, Michelle Goldberg and Michael Schmidt and Jennifer Rubin who have stepped into the footsteps of Edward R. Murrow, Eric Sevareid and Walter Cronkite.
Here at home, I value the work of our own Bill Nemitz, whose eagle eye watches over the political and social chicanery on the home front.
But then, as I sit at my Thanksgiving table, lowering my head to say the grace of thanks this year, I am afraid to close my eyes, even in prayer, because my thanks is tainted by guilt and remorse.
How do I give thanks without seeing the children sitting among their suffering and lonely cellmates this holiday — and especially Christmas Eve — in a steel cage at the bottom of America, wondering which arroyo their mother is sleeping in that night?
These children, who by the decree of the maladroit maître d’ of Mar-a-Lago, have been imprisoned in the deserts of the land of the free.
How, in the darkness of this sacred moment, do I avoid seeing an African-American citizen being dragged out of his car on a snowy night in Chicago, Memphis or St. Louis, and shoved across the car’s hood, maybe even being beaten, while trying to answer questions from an unhappy racist, white cop?
I can be thankful that there are thousands of good, white cops, those underpaid and beleaguered servants of the law, such as my nephew and niece, who have to cruise the icy streets on Christmas Eve and take pains to deliver equal justice.
As a veteran, I am very thankful this year that I’m not a decorated Army combat soldier sitting at Thanksgiving dinner with his family, head bowed in prayer for the Kurdish teammates he was forced — by a decree from the Keeper of the Republican Senate — to leave behind to be slaughtered.
Again, my thanks are spotted with guilt that I’m not one of the many decorated combat soldiers, men or women, who are also one of the innocents of DACA, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, just home from Afghanistan, ready to go to college on the GI Bill, but instead awaiting being sent back to sell oranges on the highway in San Pedro in Honduras.
This year, even though I don’t share the same prayers, I will close my eyes and sit beside the elderly Jew and his family, a survivor of the Holocaust who still remembers the firing squads at Dachau, while his great-grandson scans the pews nearby for strangers.
This Thanksgiving, antisemitism, which is once again raising its rotting face in Europe and Britain along with the ugliness of white nationalism, seems to be ignored by the grey-suited praetorian guard who stand by their emperor while the city burns.
What goes around comes around, someone once said. Richard Nixon, I believe.
God bless you. Try to have a happy Thanksgiving.

Trump's White Whale

Texto completo: Trump will not stop until he brings down Trump.
WASHINGTON -- Donald Trump is a rodomont. Not to mention a grobian. And, of course, a Sinon suffering from proditomania.
With Trump firmly lodged in our heads, it is understandable if we have all become a little conspiracy-minded.
Case in point: A few weeks ago, someone signed me up for A.Word.A.Day email from Wordsmith.org. Soon I began to detect a pattern.
Friday's word was vulgarian, following close after bareknuckle. Others included rodomont (a vain boaster), grobian (a buffoonish person) and Sinon (one who misleads and betrays). Also chirocracy (a government that rules with a heavy hand) and froward (difficult to deal with or contrary).
Sound like anyone you know?
Since this is a town of fevered conspiracists now, theories abound about why the president went to Walter Reed military hospital last Saturday. But nobody here buys that it was a spontaneous desire to do Phase 1 of a physical.
As Trump himself said Friday about it, "A lot of things are a matter with me." But we do know the name of one severe malady the president has: proditomania. A.Word.A.Day defined it as the feeling or belief that everyone is out to get you.
Trump believes that paranoia can be useful. He sees the world as vicious and life as a battle for survival.
As we draw closer to Trump getting a lump of coal in his Christmas stocking, with Nancy Pelosi implacably heading toward a holiday impeachment, his proditomania is revving up.
Even Steve Doocy looked a little bemused during Trump's shambolic 54-minute call into "Fox & Friends" on Friday.
No matter how many experts -- including the gloriously bracing Fiona Hill -- explain that it is Russia that interfered with our elections and that Russia has been scheming to deflect blame to Ukraine, Trump keeps rambling about that D.N.C. server.
"The F.B.I. went in, and they told them, 'Get out of here, we're not giving it to you,"' he said on Fox. "They gave the server to CrowdStrike, or whatever it is called, which is a company owned by a very wealthy Ukrainian. I still want to see that server."
Trying to justify why he had ousted and smeared the ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, he claimed that she was "an Obama person" who had refused to hang his picture in the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv. (A lawyer for Yovanovitch said the portrait had been hung immediately.)
"This was not an angel, this woman, O.K.?" Trump sneered, adding that when he complained that the dignified and well-respected former ambassador was being treated too gently, he was told: "Well, sir, she's a woman. We have to be nice."
It was peak Trump pique.
After climbing up in politics by putting down Barack Obama as an illegitimate president, Trump is so terrified of being seen as an illegitimate president that he acts out in ways that cause more people to see him as an illegitimate president.
His presidency began with him obsessing on his inauguration crowd size and carrying around his 2016 electoral map.
He can't get past it and it's intensifying, playing out on the world stage with national security implications. It's debilitating to his presidency, and the rest of us are hostages to his insecurities.
As Hill succinctly noted about the inability in the Trump era to separate fictional narratives from objective realities: "Our nation is being torn apart. Truth is questioned."
Vladimir Putin hit the jackpot with Trump. He makes a perfect sucker for the former K.G.B. spy.
"Thank God nobody is accusing us anymore of interfering in the U.S. elections," Putin gloated Wednesday at an economic forum in Moscow. "Now they're accusing Ukraine."
The president seems like even more of a crackpot, given the New York Times story on Friday revealing that, even as Republican lawmakers vociferously defended the president, they received a briefing "that Russia had engaged in a yearslong campaign to essentially frame Ukraine as responsible for Moscow's own hacking of the 2016 election."
Julian E. Barnes and Matthew Rosenberg reported that the Kremlin succeeded in spreading discord among its adversaries and sluicing false claims about Ukrainian meddling into Republican talking points. A lot of Republicans have dirtied themselves defending Trump, and their party will not easily recover from perverting its values.
Trump is blustering about impeachment and wanting a Senate trial and calling Pelosi -- who has his presidency in a vise grip -- "totally incompetent" and "crazy as a bedbug."
But those who know him believe that he's genuinely unnerved and even hurt at the prospect of impeachment.
One of his tweets Thursday, as he headed toward being the third president to be impeached, seemed to reflect a rare hint of vulnerability. "I never in my wildest dreams thought my name would in any way be associated with the ugly word, Impeachment!" he wrote.
It recalls a prescient moment from September when the president's former homeland security adviser, Thomas Bossert, appeared on ABC's "This Week" and warned that Trump had to let go of his conspiracy theory linking CrowdStrike, Ukraine and the D.N.C. server.
"If he continues to focus on that white whale," Bossert said, "it's going to bring him down."
But, like Ahab, Trump can't ever let go. He's hellbent on harpooning himself, chasing that which will sink him.
Seppuku. My word of the day.

Texto completo: For her exhibition at the Baltimore Museum of Art, Ms. Thomas pulled on her connections to the city to feature established and emerging artists.
Some she has known for years, others she discovered recently. All the eight artists Mickalene Thomas chose to include in her new exhibition, "A Moment's Pleasure," at the Baltimore Museum of Art, emphasize her broad network of like-minded creators.
One commonality is that they are "playing between figuration and abstraction," in the words of Carlyn Thomas, a curatorial assistant who worked on the show -- a balance similar to Ms. Thomas's own art.
Derrick Adams, 49, based in Brooklyn, creates layered, collagelike works depicting African-American lives in many media. He hopes to create a residency in Baltimore, saying, "The highest point of success is to help other artists."
Zoë Charlton, 46, who has five works on vellum in the show depicting African-American figures, recently had one of her pieces acquired by the Phillips Collection in Washington, D.C.
Theresa Chromati, 26, is recognized for powerful female forms that register swirling energy and emotion. She moved from Baltimore to Brooklyn; the show is a homecoming. "Mickalene realized this was a way to bring up the whole community, and give Baltimore positive attention."
Alex Dukes, 25, is a Long Island native who attended the Maryland Institute College of Art here. Known for her colorful personal narratives, she says the inclusion of "black American hair, like braids" in her works bolsters "representation and different perspectives" in museums. Dominiqua S. Eldridge, 26, is a digital artist in Suitland, Md. "I depict black beauty, black culture and black essence," she said. "And I like to feature women." The show includes embroideries based on digital work. Gaining traction in the art world is "difficult," she said. "It's about building connections. So this is a milestone."
Devin N. Morris, 33, based in Brooklyn, is from Baltimore. "There's a lack of professional galleries and those willing to work with people like me -- emerging artists," he said. Since Christopher Bedford arrived as director, the Baltimore Museum of Art is, Mr. Morris said, "stepping up" to counter the "elitist" tone at city institutions.
Clifford Owens, 48, a Baltimore native known for his mixed media work and provocative performances, lives in New York City. "It's so amazing to be included in a museum I grew up going to," he said.
D'Metrius John Rice, 38, said the art community in Baltimore, where he lived before moving to Austin, hums because of "New York transplants, local creative talent and people coming back and forth from D.C." He has four abstract paintings in the show.

Texto completo: After his fascination with the Snurfer, a crude version of a snowboard created in the 1960s, he built the first successful snowboard company.
Jake Burton Carpenter, whose once-modest plan to make 50 snowboards a day turned into something far bigger -- a global business that helped drive snowboarding into a popular Olympic sport -- died on Wednesday in a hospital in Burlington, Vt. He was 65.
The cause was complications of testicular cancer, his company, Burton Snowboards, which is based in Burlington, said.
Mr. Carpenter was both a driven entrepreneur and an easygoing dude who disdained a desk in his office, encouraged his employees to bring their dogs to work and gave his staff days off to snowboard when storms dropped two feet or more of snow.
"He's like the cool dad of the sport," Shaun White, who has won three Olympic gold medals in snowboarding and is a longtime Burton Snowboards endorser, told The New York Times in 2015.
When Mr. Carpenter began making snowboards in 1977, skiing was the dominant snow sport. Sherm Poppen, a Michigan businessman, had invented an early version of a snowboard, the Snurfer -- a strip of wood with a rope tied to its nose for steering -- but it was more of a toy than gear for a breakthrough sport.
Mr. Carpenter loved it, calling it "a dream come true."
"I wanted to surf, and I knew snow because I was a skier," he told The New York Times in August, after Mr. Poppen died.
Mr. Carpenter's initial goal was to make a better Snurfer, employing a small staff in a converted barn in Londonderry, Vt., and drawing on a $ 150,000 bequest from his grandmother. But that first year was filled with rejection, largely by customers at surf, ski and skateboard shops.
"Yeah, I was like Willy Loman," he said in an interview in 2017 for NPR's "How I Built This," referring to the defeated protagonist in Arthur Miller's classic play "Death of a Salesman." "I remember once going out with 38 snowboards, visiting dealers in New York State, and came back with 40 because one guy gave me two back he had bought."
Success came gradually. He sold 300 the first year and 700 the second, as word-of-mouth spread and brought in mail orders. Sales kept doubling, year after year, until the popularity of Burton's snowboards (and those made by his rivals) in the 1980s and '90s made it clear that young people had adopted snowboarding as a rebellious, low-cost alternative to skiing.
"Snowboarding attracted kids -- skateboarders and surfers -- who otherwise might not have taken up skiing," John Fry, chairman of the International Skiing History Association, wrote in an email. "His marketing genius was to capitalize on the generational clash of young snowboarders and older skiers, often their parents."
Ski resorts at first resisted the punk-music-and-rap-loving young snowboarders. Even a decade after Burton was founded, Mr. Fry said, only about 10 percent of resorts allowed snowboarders on their slopes. But by the early 1990s they had relented.
Snowboarding reached a major milestone when it became an Olympic sport, debuting at the 1998 Winter Games in Nagano, Japan. But the way it was accepted by the Olympic establishment did not please Mr. Carpenter.
The International Ski Federation did not inform him, one of the sport's pioneer figures, of the sport's entrance into the Olympics, he said. And when he arrived at the snowboarding venue he was chagrined to see a sign that said, "Sno-Boarding."
"It was not a cool moment at all," he said.
Mr. Carpenter was born on April 29, 1954, in Manhattan. His father, Edward, was an investment banker, and his mother, Katherine (Eaton) Carpenter, was a homemaker. About the same time he was Snurfing, Jake was expelled from the private Brooks School in North Andover, Mass., after being involved in a prank in which a janitor found in his possession a secret strong box, passed down through generations of students, that held the key to every lock in the school.
"I had this reputation for being so lucky -- I never got caught doing anything -- and then it all sort of caved in on me, and I got kicked out," he told Snowboarder magazine in 2000.
He righted himself at another prep school, and after graduating got his first taste of entrepreneurship, starting a landscaping business with two rakes, an old station wagon and some garbage bags.
After one year at the University of Colorado, Boulder, he left for New York University, where he earned a bachelor's degree in economics. While working for an investment firm in Manhattan, he crafted his first snowboard prototype in his apartment using a saber saw and wood.
After moving to Londonderry, he made snowboards in a barn during the day and tended bar at night. A turning point came when he sold his 700th board.
"All of a sudden, there was a hint of momentum," he told Snowboarder.
That momentum continued to build, making Burton the top snowboard maker.
Health issues intervened in later years. He received his first diagnosis of testicular cancer in 2011. Four years later he was temporarily paralyzed with Miller Fisher syndrome, a type of Guillain-Barré syndrome. He spent six weeks in intensive care using a feeding tube and a ventilator.
Despite paralysis in most of his body, his hands could move, allowing him to write notes even when his eyes could not open. He addressed his wife and sons, guests and caregivers, offering poignant and humorous observations.
"Did you think I was a goner?" he wrote one day. On another day he wrote, "And don't forget to kiss me once in a while";
on still another, "All these dudes are stressing me out."
He recovered and continued to work at the company, where his wife, Donna Carpenter, and John Lacy are the chief executives.
"We've always felt that our success has never been about us; it's about the snowboarding world," Ms. Carpenter wrote in The Times in 2012. "We believed we were pioneering something that others loved as much as we did."
In 2016, the artist Jeff Koons, who had recently come to love snowboarding, designed a snowboard with Mr. Carpenter called The Philosopher. It used Mr. Carpenter's technical specifications, notably a twin tip that would let the snowboarder ride forward and backward, and Mr. Koons's likeness of Plato with a rendering of the allegory of the cave, from "The Republic."
In addition to his wife, Mr. Carpenter is survived by his sons, George, Taylor and Timi; his sisters, Katherine McCallum and Carolyn Wright; his stepbrothers, Richard and Stephen Carpenter; his stepsisters, Posie Carpenter and Margaret Carpenter Jones; and his stepmother, Margaret (Owen) Carpenter. His brother, George, died in combat in Vietnam.
Mr. Carpenter said that one of the most difficult phases in building Burton had come when he had to acknowledge that he could not do every job in the company better than anyone else and that he had to be willing to delegate authority.
"You have to let them screw up and live through their mistakes," he said on "How I Built This." "Burton's made every mistake in the book, but I don't think we made any twice."

I'm O.K. -- You're Crying
I am a Gen X-er who generally speaks proper English and am a "digital native." (Hey, kids: We built these tools that you claim as your own.) When I respond to a text or email with "O.K.," I mean just that: O.K. As in: I hear you, I understand, I agree, I will do that. If I reply with "K," I'm just being more informal.
However, I have been informed by my Millennial and Gen Z co-workers that the new thing I'm supposed to type is "kk." To write "O.K." or "K," they tell me, is to be passive-aggressive or imply that I would like the recipient to drop dead. To which I am tempted to respond, "Believe me, if I want you to drop dead ... you'll know."
I find "kk" loathsome. Are my co-workers being overly sensitive, or am I not acknowledging the nuance of modern communication? I would really like to settle this debate once and for all. O.K.?
-- Queens
Kk.
Unfortunately, the hot and precocious young people who meme'd you this are dead right.
You reply to an email with "O.K.": For the briefest twinkling, I think "Rude."
You reply to an email with "K": For one terrible millisecond, I think (sobbing and feeling attacked), "He's acting like he's the only one who's stressed out!"
You reply to an email with "kk": I think "O.K."
"Kk" is an ice-cold glass of blood: mostly neutral, slightly basic. But do you, a Gen X-er, need to incorporate it into your own written communication? Of course not.
It's good for people to be reminded periodically that not everyone thinks or expresses themselves as they do -- that some people's arbitrary guidelines are drawn entirely differently, around concepts that would never occur to them. Because, as a woman, I maintain a bustling control center behind my thoughts where everything said to me is parsed for evidence of impending physical threats, I can quickly chalk up your lack of kk's to a microgenerational difference, and carry on with my nerve-racking life.
I myself kk rarely. I prefer "O.K.!," which feels more natural, but still conveys to the recipient, through its superfluous exclamation point, the same frantic message that I'm not annoyed or angry (omg why would I be) so please don't feel bad!! If you feel bad I can't take it!!! Lmao but I actually can't take it :)
The good news is that your co-workers think of you as someone capable of lighthearted workplace interactions. If they disliked or feared you, they would not have told you about this bizarre, lateral evolution of the English writing system. Think of the kk tutorial not as a gripe to be accommodated, but as a somewhat boring cultural fact with no direct influence on your life, like how John Adams and George H.W. Bush both lived to their nineties.
A parting thought: Sociolinguistic research -- which, until recently, tended to treat gender as binary -- largely indicates that young women are the drivers of language change. (The authors of a frequently cited 2009 article from the journal "Language" found that men often lag "a full generation behind" -- perhaps because they "retreat from or resist a change after it becomes associated with women.") I don't know for sure if the co-workers you mention are women but, on the off-chance you work with any, it's never a bad time to remind yourself that studies (and women) find that women who talk at work are regularly dismissed, interrupted or ignored.
For God, Country and Roommate
I recently moved in with an old schoolmate and someone he went to college with. I've overheard them talking about creating a start-up together. The one I went to school with was known as a notorious swindler and snake-oil salesman, and I certainly would never do business with him for those reasons. Should I tell my other roommate these premonitions, or is it none of my business?
-- D.L., Chicago
Anyone who acquired a reputation as a "notorious" con man even before college seems destined for a life of at least intermittent periods of wealth. Don't become this person's enemy by spreading rumors about him to his friend and fledgling business associate, who has no loyalty to you.
Presumably you came to some sort of financial agreement with your schoolmate about rent before moving in, which suggests either that he is capable of generating at least funds enough to live on, or that you have already been swindled by him. Either way, one indication that your schoolmate's friend places a higher value on his classmate's business acumen than yours is that you overheard the start-up conversation, rather than being invited to participate in it.
Don't get involved, but do take detailed notes about any chaos that unfolds, in case you can one day cobble them into a lucrative screenplay or whistle-blower complaint.
Now It's Time to Say Goodbye to All Our Company
I graduated from college about three years ago, and was hired from an intern role into a full-time position. The job has been fun, tough and filled with great mentors. The culture has changed in the last year because of an acquisition, and I've been pondering changing jobs. I feel bad about leaving my current job because of the amount of responsibilities I have here; it would be difficult to pick up the slack if I left. But I know I need to leave. What's the best way to communicate this to my manager and co-workers? Thank you!
-- New York
You sound like a polite, conscientious, well-adjusted person. There are only seven such employees in existence, and collectively you are responsible for the continued prosperity and protection of human society, which is why you are called The Seven Shields, as I'm sure you know. The best way to communicate your intentions is to come to your manager with an offer in hand for more money. Your manager will either try to make you a) a counteroffer or b) feel a little bad for quitting.
Luckily, you are not a charity whose mission is to serve your workplace. Telling co-workers about your job hunt could put them in the awkward position of keeping your secret while you search. (Also, everyone in the office would know immediately -- who can keep a secret?) Once your departure is official, individually inform those co-workers you most enjoy. There is a small chance these people will now become your actual friends.

Guaranteed free college tuition won't work Op-Ed

Texto completo: Free college, a fringe idea not long ago, has gone mainstream in the Democratic primary campaign. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are notably running on zeroing out tuition and fees. According to a July poll by The New York Times, about three out of five Americans support guaranteed free tuition to two- and four-year colleges. More than 20 states and a host of cities have trimmed or eliminated tuition charges at community colleges. New York state has gone further, making a no-tuition commitment to bachelor's degree candidates whose family or personal income is less than $125,000 a year.
Eliminating tuition sounds like a Utopian good, but it misses the mark. It ignores the biggest reason students aren't earning college degrees - an appallingly high dropout rate - and it may make the situation worse.
Freshmen are generally confident that they will earn a bachelor's degree in four years, but only about 40% actually do. Even after six years, just 60% have graduated. Community colleges have an even worse record - about one in three earn an associate degree in three years. A high school with such a woeful record would be labeled a dropout factory.
The effect on students who leave school before graduating is profound. They are three times as likely to default on college loans and more likely to be unemployed than college grads. Over their lifetimes, they will earn as much as $1 million less.
It's tempting to think that dropping out is merely a money issue and that zero tuition will solve the problem. Mitt Romney thought so; when he was governor of Massachusetts, he launched the merit-based Adams Scholarships, which offer eight tuition-free semesters at Massachusetts public colleges and universities to students who score high on a statewide achievement test.
But as Brandeis University economist Joshua Goodman, co-author with Sarah Cohodes of a study of the Adams Scholarships, explains, the winning students don't save much money. Tuition is relatively cheap in Massachusetts - less than $1,000 at community colleges and regional public universities. The dollar crunch comes from the fees charged for such things as enrolling in classes to participating in graduation ceremonies. Those bills can be a shocker - at the state university in Bridgewater, Mass., for instance, tuition is $910 a year but fees come to nearly $10,000.
The most comprehensive of the Democratic candidates' plans would tackle fees and tuition at public institutions, but there remains a stubborn problem. Dangling free education in front of students prompts them to choose state colleges that are often less competitive and have lower graduation rates than schools they might otherwise have attended. Even a scholarship winner can get dragged down by the forces that contribute to those lower rates. The Adams Scholarship researchers looked at students with similar test scores and compared those who took free tuition and went to state schools with those who didn't and went to more competitive schools. The Adams recipients were 40% less likely to graduate on time.
As for community college, research shows that free tuition alone at two-year schools draws students away from four-year institutions. Because the graduation rate at community colleges is much lower than at four-year schools, these students are less likely to earn bachelor's degrees. If they manage an associate diploma, they'll earn about 30% less than those who graduate with a bachelor's degree.
In short, quality matters, and many dollar-starved state schools can only afford to batch-process students. They can't provide the small classes, wide array of courses and accessible advisers that contribute to high graduation rates. Free-college proposals don't include plans to replace the money that these schools, which rely heavily on tuition, would lose if zero tuition comes to pass. What's more, economists project that in a free-college world, university enrollment would increase by as much as 22%, stretching bare-bones budgets even further.
All of this suggests a different approach to improving graduation rates. States need to exercise political leadership to restore, and then increase, the estimated $9 billion that lawmakers slashed from their higher education budgets during the last decade. In a nationwide study, economists Daniel Lovenheim, Rajashri Chakrabarti and Nicole Gorton showed the outsized impact of more funding. They compared students who were enrolled in state colleges when a budget increase kicked in and those who attended the same schools before the increased funding. By their 30s, students who had the benefit of more state support had higher credit scores and lower credit card debt than the comparison group; they were also more likely to own homes and cars, and more likely to have enrolled in graduate school.
The study didn't detail what the additional money paid for, but other research has shown that common sense investments make a difference - hiring more instructors, adding advisers who can deliver the "we have your back" assistance that students need, and offering more sections of classes required for students to finish their majors. Instead of stalling out for want of a few credits, the added class sections allow students to efficiently get their degrees and move on.
"Free college" will surely increase enrollment in four- and two-year schools, but if it doesn't get students across the finish line it won't shrink the opportunity gap. Middle-class and low-income students need financial aid, but that's different from guaranteeing a free ride for all. The goal is not to lure high schoolers into college with zero tuition, it's to assure that those who do enroll graduate.
David Kirp, a professor of public policy at the University of California at Berkeley, is the author of "The College Dropout Scandal."

It's the hope of proponents such as Sanders and Hillary Clinton, who made debt-free college a key talking point in their Democratic presidential campaigns, that New York's first-in-the-nation free tuition program for middle-class students will spread to other states. And that's the prediction of Cuomo, its main champion, who called the plan a "model for the nation."

Kill Electoral College, invite rigged elections

Texto completo: The Founders sought to create
a constitutional structure that would allow Americans to be self-governing, despite the imperfections
of human nature. They knew that people can be selfish, greedy
and too ambitious. They knew that power corrupts.
"I care not who casts the votes of a nation, provided I can count them," a New York Times editorial quipped in 1880. The editorial was poking fun at imperialism. Nevertheless, the old quote strikes at the heart of a new debate about the Electoral College – to say nothing of recent news headlines.
Everyone seems pretty certain that one or the other political party is interfering in U.S. presidential elections.
In the midst of so much turmoil and distrust, why would some Americans want to give even more power over elections to the federal government? Yet Electoral College opponents advocate for it, seemingly without realizing what they are doing.
Make no mistake: If the Electoral College is eliminated, the powers of incumbent presidents and their administrations will be vastly increased.
Democrats who are working to end the Electoral College should stop and think about that statement again: They do not trust Donald Trump. Yet they are working to give him more power over his own reelection and the election of his successor.
The Electoral College is, at its heart, a decentralized, state-by-state presidential election process. States determine the logistics of Election Day, access to the ballot, recounts and other, similar issues. Meanwhile, the federal government must take a back seat because the Constitution gives the national government only a limited role to play at election time.
Notably, while the Constitution grants Congress some authority in elections, the executive branch is left out in the cold: Presidents have no direct power over their own reelections.
Consider how things would change if the country were to eliminate the Electoral College and move to a single, national presidential election instead. A federal government that once played a secondary role would now sit in the driver's seat. All election matters would be subject to federal control. Such changes would be necessary because of the altered nature of the election: Instead of 51 statewide election pools, in which each state and Washington, D.C., selects its own electors, American voters would all be thrown into a single national election pool.

Texto completo: "I care not who casts the votes of a nation, provided I can count them," a New York Times editorial quipped in 1880. The editorial was poking fun at imperialism. Nevertheless, the old quote strikes at the heart of a new debate about the Electoral College – to say nothing of recent news headlines.
Everyone seems pretty certain that one or the other political party is interfering in U.S. presidential elections.
In the midst of so much turmoil and distrust, why would some Americans want to give even more power over elections to the federal government? Yet Electoral College opponents advocate for it, seemingly without realizing what they are doing.
Make no mistake: If the Electoral College is eliminated, the powers of incumbent presidents and their administrations will be vastly increased.
Democrats who are working to end the Electoral College should stop and think about that statement again: They do not trust Donald Trump. Yet they are working to give him more power over his own reelection and the election of his successor.
The Electoral College is, at its heart, a decentralized, state-by-state presidential election process. States determine the logistics of Election Day, access to the ballot, recounts and other, similar issues.
Meanwhile, the federal government must take a back seat because the Constitution gives the national government only a limited role to play at election time.
Notably, while the Constitution grants Congress some authority in elections, the executive branch is left out in the cold: Presidents have no direct power over their own reelections.
Consider how things would change if the country were to eliminate the Electoral College and move to a single, national presidential election instead. A federal government that once played a secondary role would now sit in the driver's seat. All election matters would be subject to federal control. Such changes would be necessary because of the altered nature of the election: Instead of 51 statewide election pools, in which each state and Washington, D.C., selects its own electors, American voters would all be thrown into a single national election pool.
A new federal election code and bureaucracy would be needed to ensure that voters are being treated equally, even across state lines. It is easy to imagine a new Department of Elections to oversee the administration of the federal election code and a president appointing someone to run it. Presidents who chose to run for a second term would enjoy a nice luxury: The person in charge of their reelection would also be a person beholden to them for a job as secretary of Elections.
Americans are already worried that institutions such as the FBI or the State Department are being used inappropriately. Perhaps they are, and such abuse of our institutions should be addressed. Yet how much easier would it be for an incumbent class of federal officials to legally influence election outcomes if a Department of Elections and a U.S. Election Code were in charge of every aspect of presidential elections?
How fortunate that the Founders created something different, ensuring that checks and balances exist even within our presidential election system.

Texto completo: The "Saturday Night Live" veteran returns to host for a fifth time, and a dystopian sci-fi series begins streaming on Amazon.
What's on TV
SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE 11:29 p.m. on NBC. It's hard to believe that Will Ferrell, who was an "S.N.L." cast member for seven years and is credited with some of the show's most memorable characters, will just now be hosting the show for a fifth time. On Saturday, Ferrell will be inaugurated into the so-called Five-Timers Club, joining a group of stars that includes Bill Murray, Justin Timberlake and Tina Fey. Before becoming a major movie star, Ferrell got big laughs as the cowbell-happy member of the Blue Öyster Cult and as Craig, the pep rally-ready Spartan cheerleader, as well as for his spot-on impressions of George W. Bush, Robert Goulet and Alex Trebek. The musical guest will be the 20-year-old songwriter King Princess, making her "S.N.L." debut.
THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE MILLBROOK TWINS 7 p.m. on Oxygen. This two-hour special attempts to unravel a decades-old cold case. In 1990, Dannette and Jeannette Millbrook, 15-year-old twins, went missing near their home in Augusta, Ga. Now, a former federal prosecutor, Laura Coates, and a former homicide detective, Page Reynolds, will re-examine the case, speaking with experts close to the investigation, eyewitnesses, the local authorities and family members.
CHRISTMAS AT GRACELAND: HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS 8 p.m. on Hallmark. After playing a movie star on "Entourage," Adrian Grenier trades Hollywood for Memphis, Tenn., in this Hallmark Christmas special, starring opposite Kaitlin Doubleday of "Empire" and "Nashville" fame. A romance develops as Owen (Grenier), a wealthy widower, works with his nanny, Harper (Doubleday), to plan a Christmas fund-raiser at the Graceland mansion. Priscilla Presley also makes a cameo.
What's Streaming
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
THE FEED Stream on Amazon. This new dystopian series, based on a novel by Nick Clark Windo, paints a world in which people can receive an implant that connects their inner thoughts, emotions and memories to others' in a feed. The show follows Tom (Guy Burnet), a psychologist who works with people who have become addicted to the feed, which is technology that Tom's father invented. When the feed is hacked, leaving those with the implant vulnerable to experiencing erratic and violent behavior, Tom's family tries to cover up the truth and he tries to save those affected. Alongside Burnet, the show stars Nina Toussaint-White of "Doctor Who," Michelle Fairley of "Game of Thrones" and David Thewlis of "Fargo."
LOVE, ANTOSHA (2019) Rent on Amazon and iTunes. When the actor Anton Yelchin died at the age of 27 in a freak accident, he left an impressive film career behind him, as well as a number of admiring fans, family members and contemporaries. Garret Price directs this moving documentary, named for the way Yelchin signed letters to his mother, about the star's life, his struggle with cystic fibrosis and the work he left behind. The film, which features interviews with Yelchin's parents, as well as Kristen Stewart, Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pine, was a New York Times Critic's Pick.

Texto completo: A familiar face in movies and on television, he rose to fame in 1967 as the outlaw couple's dimwitted accomplice, earning an Oscar nomination.
Michael J. Pollard, who rose to fame in the 1967 hit film "Bonnie and Clyde" as C.W. Moss, the dimwitted gas station attendant who became a criminal accomplice, and went on to a long career as a Hollywood character actor, died on Wednesday at a hospital in Los Angeles. He was 80.
A friend, Dawn Walker, said in an interview that the cause was cardiac arrest.
Mr. Pollard had been a familiar face on television since the late 1950s. He most often played likable but socially inept characters, and usually ranked fairly far down on the cast list. In two separate shows, he played the cousin of a beloved supporting character -- Jerome Krebs, cousin to Maynard G. Krebs (Bob Denver) on "The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis," and Virgil, cousin to Deputy Barney Fife (Don Knotts), on "The Andy Griffith Show."
He also had a memorable role in the first season of the television series "Star Trek," in 1966, playing a creepy, mischievous teenage cult leader on a planet of children.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
But his performance in "Bonnie and Clyde," which earned him an Academy Award nomination for best supporting actor, raised his profile -- and changed the way Hollywood saw him.
In a 1968 interview with The New York Times, Mr. Pollard noted that directors had once been frustrated by his slow, somewhat eccentric way of delivering lines, but that the success of "Bonnie and Clyde" had changed that.
"They say, 'Just do your thing, Michael, whatever it is,"' he said. "Same thing I've been doing for 10 years, man."
"His thing" was evident in a scene in "Bonnie and Clyde" in which Mr. Pollard, who is supposed to be driving the getaway car for the two outlaws, ends up parking the car.
"We made that up," Mr. Pollard told the film critic Roger Ebert in 1969. "See, I can't drive a car. There was this guy teaching me, but I couldn't learn. So here I was stuck in the parking place, and Penn" -- Arthur Penn, the director -- "said, 'O.K., do it that way."'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The writer Nora Ephron said it was Mr. Pollard's face that grabbed one's attention. "Potato face," she wrote in 1970 in The New York Post. "And a little like a cherub blowing friendly winds on old-fashioned maps. A little hilarious."
He told Ms. Ephron that he thought his face was weird. "When it was young it bothered me," he said. "But then I became an actor and everyone started saying, 'What a face. Wow.' I believed all my publicity."
He was born Michael John Pollack Jr. on May 30, 1939, in Passaic, N.J. His father was a bartender and his mother, Sonia (Dubanowich) Pollack, was a homemaker.
He is survived by a daughter, Holly, from his marriage to the actress Beth Howland, and a son, Axel Emmett, from another marriage. Both marriages ended in divorce. His sister, Ruth Coughlin, died in 2014.
He graduated from Montclair Academy in New Jersey and decided he wanted to be an actor after seeing Marlon Brando in the 1954 movie "On the Waterfront." He enrolled at the Actors Studio in New York, where he studied with Lee Strasberg, among others.
At the Actors Studio he did a scene with Marilyn Monroe, at her request. According to Ms. Ephron, when Ms. Monroe had called him up to do the scene, she said: "Hello, this is Marilyn. The girl from class."
He quickly proved his versatility by scoring both comic and dramatic roles in television, film and the theater, starting in 1958. He went on to act in more than 200 films and television shows.
His early TV appearances included roles in the anthology series "Lux Playhouse," the Cold War dramatic series "Five Fingers" and a 1959 television play by Archibald MacLeish, "Secret of Freedom," in which he played a shoeshine boy.
He appeared in two episodes of "Alfred Hitchcock Presents," again playing a shoeshine boy in one and a 13-year-old boy in the other. Thanks to his slight build, Mr. Pollard, who was 20 at the time, easily passed for characters much younger.
On Broadway, he landed a non-singing role in the original Broadway production of "Bye Bye Birdie." A 1960 blurb in Playbill noted that he "began the season with a set of splendid notices for his performance in William Inge's 'A Loss of Roses."'
Playbill added: "Following the strong impression he made as Homer Macauley in the television version of Saroyan's 'The Human Comedy,' he was recruited for the Circle in the Square's revival of 'Our Town."'
Multiple roles followed in quick, even overlapping, succession. They included a part in the Walt Disney family musical "Summer Magic," opposite Hayley Mills, and another in the TV series "I Spy," which starred Bill Cosby and Robert Culp.
In 1966, Mr. Pollard played an uncredited but memorable bit as an airplane mechanic with a runny nose in the Norman Jewison comedy "The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming."
His breakout performance in "Bonnie and Clyde," with a cast led by Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway and also including Gene Hackman and Estelle Parsons, won Mr. Pollard not only an Oscar nomination but also a BAFTA Award, Britain's equivalent of an Academy Award, for most promising newcomer in a leading film role.
That same year, he landed a lead role in Derek May's "Niagara Falls," a kind of anti-travelogue in which fictional interviews are interspersed with documentary footage.
One of Mr. Pollard's most popular movies was "Little Fauss and Big Halsy" (1970), a motorcycle racing movie with Robert Redford that developed a cult following. (Mr. Pollard played the woebegone Fauss to Mr. Redford's womanizing Halsy.)
He went on to prominent roles in films like "Dirty Little Billy" (1972), "Roxanne" (1987) and "Melvin and Howard" (1980), the story of Melvin Dummar, a gas station owner in Utah who claimed to be Howard Hughes's beneficiary. Mr. Pollard played the buddy of Mr. Dummar (Paul Le Mat).
In 1990 he played the surveillance expert Bug Bailey in "Dick Tracy," Mr. Beatty's adaptation of the comic strip (in which he also starred). More recently Mr. Pollard had a role in the 2003 cult horror film "House of 1000 Corpses." He was last seen in the thriller "The Woods" in 2012; he also has roles in two films that have not yet been released, according to the Internet Movie Database.
Mr. Ebert, the critic, was more or less smitten from the start with Mr. Pollard, who was largely unknown until "Bonnie and Clyde."
In his review of "Enter Laughing," Carl Reiner's semi-autobiographical 1967 movie about a young man's entry into show business, Mr. Ebert wrote that Mr. Pollard, who had a supporting role, "brings his squint and grin to the part of Marvin, our hero's buddy, and steals every scene."
"There is something about Pollard that is absolutely original," Mr. Ebert added, "and seems to strike audiences as irresistibly funny and deserving of affection."

Texto completo: The Nobel laureate, who died in August, was honored at the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine in New York. Speakers included Oprah Winfrey, Angela Davis and Fran Lebowitz.
More than 3,000 people gathered at the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine on Thursday to celebrate Toni Morrison, a giant of American literature whose work won acclaim for its groundbreaking style and complex exploration of black American identity.
Oprah Winfrey, Angela Davis, Fran Lebowitz, Edwidge Danticat and Ta-Nehisi Coates, among other speakers from the worlds of literature, journalism and the arts, shared memories of their time with Morrison and her impact on their work and lives.
"She took the canon and broke it open," said Winfrey, who selected many of Morrison's novels for her book club. Reading them, Winfrey said, she experienced "a kind of emancipation, a liberation, an ascension to another level of understanding."
For Coates, author of the novel "The Water Dancer" and nonfiction that includes "Between the World and Me" and "We Were Eight Years in Power," Morrison taught him that "Black is beautiful, but it ain't always pretty," he said, and that good work sometimes required ugliness.
"The beauty must ache. The beauty must sometimes repulse, even as it enchants, even as it informs, even as it arrests," he said.
[ Read The Times's obituary of Toni Morrison. ]
Morrison, who died in August at 88, published 11 novels as well as children's books and essay collections over her career. She was praised for her style, which sometimes contained a mythic quality, incorporating multiple voices and story lines and exploring the legacy of slavery in incandescent prose.
A number of Morrison's early novels are now considered classics, including "The Bluest Eye" (1970), "Sula" (1973) and "Song of Solomon" (1977), for which she won a National Book Critics Circle Award. Morrison was the first African-American woman to win the Nobel Prize in Literature, in 1993, and also received the Pulitzer Prize in 1988 for "Beloved," widely considered her masterwork.
Winfrey recalled feeling star-struck when she first met Morrison. It was at Maya Angelou's house in 1993, at a party to celebrate Morrison's Nobel Prize. "My head and my heart were swirling," Winfrey said. "Every time I looked at her I couldn't even speak. I had to catch my breath."
When Winfrey noticed Morrison trying to get the waiter's attention for some water, she almost "tripped over myself trying to get up from the table to get it for her," she said.
The commentator Fran Lebowitz, a longtime friend of Morrison's, recounted times when Morrison would comfort her after a bad review. Morrison herself was impervious to criticism, Lebowitz said, so she "assigned myself the task of holding Toni's grudges for her."

Born in Lorain, Ohio, in 1931, Morrison was survived by her son Harold Ford Morrison and three grandchildren. Before she started writing her own books in her late 30s, she was an editor at Random House, working with such writers as Angela Davis, Gayl Jones and Toni Cade Bambara.
"Editing was her job, but it was also her activism, her community work," said David Remnick, the editor of The New Yorker.
Davis echoed this idea, saying that though Morrison did not march or participate in protest, she wanted to "make sure there was a written record of those who did march and put themselves on the line."
"So many of us feel that we had found ourselves through, because of and in relation to Toni and her work," Davis said. For those who knew Morrison, she said, the greatest challenge is "to envision the world without the glorious laughter of our dear, dear Toni."
St. John the Divine was filled to capacity by admirers of Morrison's work. The mood was at times jovial, at times somber. Some attendees snapped their fingers and clapped their hands, while others bowed their heads.
The Rev. Thurselle C. Williams came from New Jersey for the event but said she would have traveled much farther. "When she passed, I knew wherever there was going to be a memorial, no matter where it was, I needed to be there," she said. Morrison's work, she added, "not only shaped the lives of African-Americans but helped them understand themselves even more."
Waiting outside the church in a line that wrapped around the corner, Arielle Isack, a 21-year-old student at nearby Columbia University, said that through books like "Sula" and "Beloved," Morrison had given her "access to a reality" she would not have been privy to otherwise. "You learn the history of black people in America, but I feel like she brought me there," Isack said.
Another Columbia student, Delia Anderson-Colson, called it a historic event that she could not miss.
In a moving speech, the novelist and National Book Award winner Jesmyn Ward recalled the horrors of slavery with detailed descriptions of Africans being stolen from their homes. "We wandering children heard Toni Morrison's voice, and she saved us," she said.
She did it by telling her readers, "You are worthy to be seen," Ward said. "You are worthy to be heard. You are worthy to be sat with, to be walked beside."

Texto completo: ESPER RETURNS: Before embarking for home from Hanoi, Defense Secretary Mark Esper told reporters traveling with him that he rated his nine-day Asia trip a success, cementing alliances and sending a strong signal that the U.S. would be challenging China and standing up for the international rules-based order.
“A very positive trip all the way around,” he said of his stops in South Korea, Thailand, the Philippines and Vietnam. “Overall, the message was this is our priority theater. We're here to stay.”
But on his first visit to Seoul as defense secretary, Esper failed to make headway on the three objectives he laid out at the start of his trip last week — to convince South Korea it needed to pay more for the security provided by U.S. troops, to get Japan and South Korea to resolve a dispute over intelligence sharing, and to jumpstart stalled nuclear talks with North Korea by cancelling planned military exercises.
‘VERY REASONABLE DISCUSSIONS’: Esper defended putting the squeeze on South Korea, even as he refused to confirm the widely reported $5 billion request that shocked Seoul and has strained the 66-year-old alliance.
“I don't think it's unreasonable to ask countries who have the means to contribute more to their own defense and to the cost sharing of United States presence to do more,” Esper said, noting the State Department is in charge of the talks that collapsed last week when the U.S. side walked out.
“I'm not going to negotiate a number here,” he said. “I think it's still a strong alliance … We need to keep moving forward, but these are very reasonable discussions to have with regard to cost sharing.”
RELATED: Pentagon riled over false report of US troop withdrawal from South Korea
‘DISAPPOINTING’ RESPONSE: When he left Washington, Esper hinted the U.S. was willing to scale back joint military exercises that North Korea routinely labels invasion rehearsals. After leaving Seoul he announced the next scheduled drills would be postponed as a goodwill gesture to help get diplomacy back on track.
North Korea spurned the move, and rejected further talks. “I saw the one response they made was not as positive as we would like, obviously, and that's disappointing,” Esper said. “But I don't regret trying to take the high road, if you will, and keep the door open for peace and diplomacy if we can move the ball forward.”
JAPAN, SOUTH KOREA STILL FEUDING: In his talks with Japanese and South Korean officials, Esper pleaded with the two U.S. allies to settle their differences over a 2016 intelligence sharing agreement that the U.S. sees as crucial to countering North Korea, and which South Korea is threatening to withdraw from in a trade dispute with Japan.
But Esper’s appeals have fallen on deaf ears. “The tension between the Japanese and the South Koreans obviously goes back many decades,” he said. “My message to them was, look, I understand the historical issues. I understand the recent items that prompted it, but we have far greater concerns, if you will, that involve Pyongyang and Beijing, and we have to move forward.”
South Korea is expected to allow the agreement to expire this week, unless Japan makes a last minute concession.
NOT GOING THERE: Esper spoke to reporters as one of his Deputy Assistant Secretaries, Laura Cooper, was testifying in the impeachment inquiry on Capitol Hill, but Esper scrupulously avoided being drawn into the political drama in Washington.
“I'm going to stand by where I've been on this matter. There's a congressional inquiry underway. I'm not going to add to it at this point in time,” he said in response to questions about military assistance to Ukraine. “I'm not going to go down that path. I'll let Laura's testimony stand on its own.”
Asked if he would testify if subpoenaed, Esper sai, “We'll see. Congress has the right to call whoever they want, I guess.”

HAPPENING TODAY: The folks at the American Enterprise Institute are releasing a data-driven report this morning looking at trends in where military veterans, live, work, vote, and will need health care.
The report "Mapping Veterans: Not Who You Think, Not Where You Think" by Rebecca Burgess uses a series of animated and still charts to visualize U.S. veteran demographics, and analyze how a concentration of veterans in some congressional district could affect electoral politics in the future.
Among the trends: “Unlike the general shifts in the veteran population, which sees most veterans in the South and West, high numbers of Vietnam-era veterans still live in the Northeast and Midwest, especially compared to the West.”“With the Gulf War and post–Gulf War veterans, we see higher numbers in the Southeast, but a fair amount (in the 240,000–300,000 range) live in such disparate states as Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Tennessee.”“Post-9/11 veterans are flocking to Texas, but also congregating in Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia, and Washington State.”
TRUMP TRAVELS TO DOVER: President Trump, First Lady Melania Trump, Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley and national security adviser Robert O’Brien all made the trip to Dover Air Force Base, Del., last night to pay their respects to two U.S. soldiers who died when their helicopter crashed in Afghanistan Wednesday.
The Pentagon has identified the fallen as Chief Warrant Officer 2 David C. Knadle and Chief Warrant Officer 2 Kirk T. Fuchigami Jr. Both soldiers were assigned to 1st Battalion, 227th Aviation Regiment, 1st Air Cavalry Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division, Fort Hood, Texas.
Trump saluted as an Army honor guard carried flag-draped cases containing the soldier remains, in what the military calls a “dignified transfer ceremony.”
Trump led a large delegation which also included Deputy Defense Secretary David Norquist, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy, and actor Jon Voight, who was awarded the National Medal of Arts by Trump at a White House ceremony earlier in the day.
The latest death brings to 19 the number of U.S. troops who have died in combat in Afghanistan this year. Since war began in Oct. 2001, more than 2,400 Americans forces have been killed in the line of duty.
TRAINING ACCIDENT TIED TO FUNDING: Two Air Force pilots in training were killed yesterday when their T-38 Talon flipped over on landing in an accident that involved another training jet at Vance Air Force base in northwestern Oklahoma.
While the crash is under investigation, Oklahoma Sen. Jim Inhofe, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, issued a statement saying the tragedy underscores the need for Congress to pass the Pentagon’s full FY 2020 budget, which includes more money for training and flight hours, modernization of equipment and other safety upgrades.
“Military aviation is inherently dangerous, and our pilots and pilot trainees rely on training to ensure they can do their mission,” Inhofe said. “That’s why it’s so important that Congress ensure training and readiness programs are well-funded. This is the least we can do to make sure our airmen can safely meet current and future threats and to prevent incidents like what happened at Vance today from happening again.”
TRUMP SIGNS CR: With just hours to go before the midnight deadline, President Trump last night signed an extension of the continuing resolution to fund the federal government through Dec. 20.
The stopgap measure passed the Senate yesterday by a 74-20 vote. It limits spending to last year’s levels, with two exceptions. It also includes money for 3.1 percent military pay raise in addition to funding for the U.S. census.
The dispute over funding for President Trump’s border wall upgrades remains the main stumbling block to passing the full $738 billion defense budget for the fiscal year that started Oct. 1.
ROOD ARRIVAL: John Rood, the Pentagon’s undersecretary for policy is in Bahrain for the International Institute for Strategic Studies Manama Dialogue Regional Security Summit.
“The Manama Dialogue is an important opportunity to discuss regional issues and advance U.S. priorities,” the Pentagon said in a statement “Undersecretary Rood will participate in the formal agenda of the summit, bilateral meetings, and key leader engagements.”
IN DIRE STRAITS? A new report from the Center for a New American Security examines various scenarios for a “tanker war” in the Persian Gulf, in which Iran might threaten or block oil shipments, and how that might affect the world oil markets.
The report — issued jointly by CNAS and Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University — attempts to predict what would happen if tensions between the United States and Iran continue to escalate.
“The authors conclude that the impacts on oil prices from a U.S.-Iran crisis in the Gulf are significant, but likely overestimated by experts and policymakers who view Iran’s ability to close the Strait as a major source of leverage,” says an introduction to the report, which is titled, “In Dire Straits? Implications of U.S.-Iran Tensions for the Global Oil Market.”
“The report finds that only in more extreme scenarios would a dramatic shift in oil prices be seen. The more serious consequence would be that the United States would be forced to maintain a significant air and naval presence in the Persian Gulf in perpetuity, undermining efforts to refocus American military power on great power competition with China and Russia and costing the U.S. taxpayers billions of dollars.”

“I will tell you, with regard to my visit to the prison, it was a chance for me to honor our POWs who spent years there in some very tough conditions. I was not aware of how much the Vietnamese had suffered at the hands of the French for many decades before that. So it again, it helps enrich your understanding of the history of Vietnam and how they came about this all.”

'BEAUTIFUL' FRIENDSHIPS

Texto completo:  Tom Hanks has never played a superhero. But when the actor recently donned a very simple cardigan sweater, and the slacks to go with it, he felt like one.
"I felt like Batman. It felt like I was wearing the cape and the cowl of the Dark Knight detective," Hanks says. "There's only one person you can be when you put those things on, and that's Fred Rogers."
Since it was first announced, Hanks' casting as the beloved children's television host in "A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood" has had the feeling of kismet. Here was an actor nearly synonymous with affability, with "niceness," playing one of the friendliest faces to ever flicker across a TV screen. Hanks might as well have been answering a Bat Signal in the sky.
But as inevitable as Hanks playing Mr. Rogers may have seemed, it never would have happened without Marielle Heller, the filmmaker of the literary forger drama "Can You Ever Forgive Me?" and the '70s coming of age tale "The Diary of a Teenage Girl." The film's script, by Noah Harpster and Micah Fitzerman-Blue, had been floating around for years before Heller got attached. Hanks had already passed on it, more than once.
"I didn't pass on you," Hanks said in an interview alongside Heller. "I just passed on a thing."
It would probably please Mr. Rogers that the first big-screen fiction film about him was based, from the start, on a newfound friendship. Hanks and Heller met at a backyard birthday party for Hanks' son Colin. Hanks had just read a New York Times article about female filmmakers and mentioned it to Heller after learning she was a director.
"And she said, 'I'm in it,'" recalls Hanks. "And I said, 'Well, of course you are and I have to remove my shoe from my mouth."
Hanks, newly resolved to work more with female directors, promised to watch "Diary of a Teenage Girl."
"I thought, 'Sure, Tom Hanks. I'm sure you'll run right out and watch my movie,'" says Heller. "And you did!"
Within days, Hanks called to set up a meeting, and that led to "A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood." Sony Pictures releases it in theaters this weekend. Based loosely on an Esquire Magazine article by Tom Junod, the film's protagonist is a New York journalist named Lloyd Vogel (Matthew Rhys) assigned to profile Rogers. Heller and Hanks view Rogers as the movie's antagonist - the agent of change in Lloyd's life, whose sincerity and caring disarm the cynical reporter.
Getting close to Rogers also altered Hanks and Heller. The production had the blessing of Joanne Rogers, Fred's widow, and much of it was shot on location in Pittsburgh. Hanks wore Rogers' old ties. He swam the same laps in a local pool. They collectively tried to live the kindness preached by Rogers, an ordained Presbyterian minister. The movie impresses the point that Rogers wasn't a saint; he had to work at being good.
"At one point early on, Tom said to me, 'I get the feeling none of us are going to be the same after making this movie,'" Heller says.
That meant trying to slow down not just the tempo of the scenes but the entire workings of a movie set. Heller's son, 2-years-old when they started, was often on set, and occasionally in the director's chair. Heller shortened the day-to-day schedule so that everyone, including herself, could be home by their children's bedtime on most nights.
"For me, as a mom of a little kid, that's the difference between being able to keep making movies or not being able to keep making movies," says Heller. "How do we think about our humanity while making movies? Would Fred Rogers have wanted us to make a movie about him where we all abandoned our kids in order to make the movie? I don't think so."
In  his 2.5 star review, which ran Tuesday, Newsday's Rafer Guzman called "A  Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood" a "mix of genuinely moving moments and slightly winking artifice." (Read the full review at newsday.com/movies) Here's what some other critics said: It sends you out of the movie feeling as if you've spent time with Fred Rogers and that you have definitely benefited from the contact .- San Francisco Chronicle It's a damn-near irresistible movie that speaks from the heart.  -Rolling Stone One is left wanting to know more about Mr. Rogers, but the film reduces him to little more than a kind of superhero family therapist. -Arizona Republic Mr. Rogers had a way of disarming doubters who fell into his orbit, and the film does, too. - New York Magazine Nearly impossible not to L-I-K-E it, exactly as it is. - Entertainment Weekly

AT THE MOVIES; REVIEW; Lawyer's heroics run deep; Mark Ruffalo deftly takes on the long fight to expose a polluter in 'Dark Waters'

Texto completo: If the story of "Dark Waters" sounds familiar, to a certain extent it is. But this film is not business as usual, with the presence of director Todd Haynes and star Mark Ruffalo the key reasons why.
On the most basic level "Dark Waters" is a whistleblower story, the latest in a genre of doing-the-right-thing scenarios that includes such popular films as "Erin Brockovich," "The Insider" and even "All the President's Men."
Inspired by an article in the New York Times Magazine, "Dark Waters" could have simply followed the template of the story's upbeat headline, "The Lawyer Who Became DuPont's Worst Nightmare," telling the story of attorney Robert Bilott, who worked for more than 20 years to expose decades of heedless environmental contamination dreadful enough to cost the chemical giant $670 million in fines.

Ruffalo, an actor with an activist bent, read that story and decided to star in a movie version, becoming lead producer and hiring Haynes, a director whose 1995 "Safe" was ecologically prescient, and a filmmaker who never does anything the expected way.
Working with screenwriters Mario Correa and Matthew Michael Carnahan, Haynes has constructed a dark, edgy film, disturbing and meant to be, a real-life horror show that details the impunity with which DuPont put profits above the known harm its chemicals were causing.
"Dark Waters" also focuses on the wrenching, disconcerting consequences of doing the right thing, on the number of grinding years of unrelenting, life-changing pressure -- more than 20 in this case -- that were needed to even begin to make a difference.
One of the many ironies in this story is that Bilott was in almost all ways the least likely guy to become the environmental hero he turned out to be.
Yes, Bilott (played by Ruffalo) was an attorney, but the Cincinnati firm he worked for was old-school conservative to the core. Recently made a partner, his idea of a good time was attending the annual Ohio Chemical Alliance dinner and his area of specialization was defending big corporations rather than suing them.
That all began to change on a day in 1998 when gruff and furious Wilbur Tennant (a brilliant Bill Camp), a farmer from Parkersburg, W.V., who was acquainted with Bilott's beloved grandmother, made the trip to Cincinnati and insisted, in an accent so thick as to be almost indecipherable, "I want a lawyer."
Though he's a new father and his wife, Sarah (an expert Anne Hathaway), is not sure why he's even bothering, Bilott feels compelled to take the drive to Parkersburg and see what Tennant's complaint is all about.
He gets more than he bargained for. A man on fire with the justness of his cause and livid that no one is paying attention, Tennant has both physical evidence and videotape recordings of the horrors that have been visited on his herd of cattle, 190 of which he has buried.
Tennant feels that the damage is caused by the neighboring Dry Run Landfill, where the Washington Works factory operated by mighty DuPont deposits its chemical waste. Moved by what he's seen, Bilott says he will try to get some answers.
Before making what he views as a friendly colleague-to-colleague request to a pal at DuPont, Bilott runs his plan past his superior, the buttoned-down Tom Terp (Tim Robbins, expert as well).
"It's just a small matter for a family friend," Bilott says softly, and Terp tells him to keep his inquiry "surgical." Neither man has any idea of what they, and their firm, are getting into, though when a DuPont functionary darkly warns Bilott that "you're flushing your career down the toilet," he starts to get the idea.
That's because, as the lawyer chillingly finds out, a chemical variously known as PFOA or C8 and essential to the manufacture of Teflon, is being released into the Parkersburg water supply and causing widespread damage.
Because of legal loopholes, this chemical is outside of governmental knowledge and regulation and DuPont, not eager to jeopardize a billion-dollar-a-year product, refuses to do anything about it.
Not even an initially patient wife who comes to angrily say "I hope you know what you're doing" understands why Bilott perseveres, but the combination of Ruffalo's quietly intense performance and Haynes' direction illuminates both what drives him and what the cost can be.
An actor whose presence is always welcome, Ruffalo is splendid at projecting the unusual combination of bred-in-the-bone idealism with mulish stubbornness that made it impossible for Bilott to walk away.
This despite so much personal and professional pressure (including disbelief and ostracism from locals who insist that DuPont is "good people") that the ordeal makes him fear he is losing both his health and his mind. Seeing "Dark Waters" makes you wonder not why more people don't call corporations to account but why anyone does. And makes us all the more grateful when they do.

Texto completo: Presumiendo con fotos suyas su amistad con el ex presidente Bill Clinton, el millonario Jeffrey Epstein seducía a las menores de edad que llevaba a sus casas, según afirma una de sus víctimas en la última demanda presentada ayer en Nueva York.
La ex modelo, quien es identificado sólo como “Mary Doe” en la demanda federal, dijo que cuando fue a su casa del Upper East Side (9 East 71 St) tenía 16 años, en 2004.
Epstein le dijo que él y el presidente Clinton eran “mejores amigos”, afirma la querella, según New York Post.
La demandante dice que llegó a EEUU desde una nación no identificada devastada por la guerra como refugiada unos años antes y le dijo a Epstein que las políticas presidenciales de Clinton hicieron posible que ella y su familia se establecieran en este país.
Al oírla, Epstein le comentó que personalmente agradecería a “Bill en nombre de ella y de su familia”, dice la demanda.
Según la denuncia, Epstein abusó sexualmente de ella varias veces cuando era una modelo adolescente que trabajaba y vivía en la ciudad de Nueva York.
El pasado 10 de agosto, Epstein (66) fue hallado muerto en su celda en el Centro Correccional Metropolitano (MCC) del Bajo Manhattan, dos días después de firmar un testamento, siguiendo un primer supuesto intento de suicidio el 23 de julio.
En esa mansión de siete pisos en Manhattan, la policía reportó tras su muerte que Epstein tenía colgada una extravagante pintura al óleo del ex presidente Clinton, con un vestido azul de mujer y tacones rojos, simulando a Mónica Lewinsky y descansando en una silla en la Oficina Oval.
Desde su arresto en julio, The New York Times destacó la amistad en el pasado de Epstein con personalidades como el Príncipe Andrés de Inglaterra, el cineasta Woody Allen y los presidentes Donald Trump y Clinton.
Enseguida, Clinton emitió un comunicado distanciándose del acusado pedófilo.
Aunque su muerte fue calificada oficialmente de suicidio por ahorcamiento, en las últimos semanas han vuelto los rumores sobre asesinato por estrangulación.

'Climate emergency' is Oxford Dictionary's word of the year

Texto completo: The word of the year is "climate emergency," according to the Oxford Dictionary.
The term is defined as "a situation in which urgent action is required to reduce or halt climate change and avoid potentially irreversible environmental damage resulting from it," the Oxford Dictionary reported.
Oxford chose "climate emergency" as the word of the year from a short list of words that were all related to the environment, such as climate crisis, eco-anxiety, ecocide, global heating and climate action.
Analysis of language data by Oxford shows the rapid rise of the term from relative obscurity to becoming one of the most prominent – and prominently debated – terms of 2019.
"Usage of the phrase 'climate emergency' increased steeply over the course of 2019, and by September it was more than 100 times as common as it had been the previous year," Oxford said in a statement.
In fact, usage of the term soared more than 10,700% between September 2018 and September 2019.
Warning to the world: Over 11,000 scientists around the world declare a 'climate emergency'
In 2019, climate emergency surpassed all other types of emergency to become the most written about emergency by a huge margin, with over three times the usage frequency of health, the second-ranking word.
Katherine Connor Martin, an editor at Oxford Dictionaries, told the New York Times, "When we were looking through the evidence, it was just clear that issues relating to the climate were running through all the different lexical items we were working with. It reflects it was a real preoccupation of the English-speaking world in 2019. "
Earlier in November, in a new report, a global team of more than 11,000 scientists from over 150 countries officially declared that the world is in a "climate emergency. "
“Scientists have a moral obligation to warn humanity of any great threat,” said Thomas Newsome of the University of Sydney, one of the report's authors, in a statement. “From the data we have, it is clear we are facing a climate emergency. ”
Countries such as the United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, France and Argentina have all declared climate emergencies, the Weather Channel reported.
And, as the Guardian explained, even though “climate emergency” is two words, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation’s resident linguist explained in 2017 that single words can consist of two parts.
The word of the year citation is meant to capture the "preoccupations of the passing year, and have a lasting potential as a term of cultural significance," Oxford said.
According to Oxford, recent words of the year have included vape, toxic, youthquake and post-truth.

Texto completo: NEW YORK — Nobel laureate Toni Morrison, a colossal figure in American literature, received a final goodbye from friends and followers Thursday at a celebration of her life at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in Manhattan.
Morrison died August. 5 at 88.
Morrison's works, often described as incomparable and revolutionary, communicated the pain and prejudice of the black experience, especially that of black women, to millions of readers around the world.
Nine celebrities and literary masters spoke at the memorial, among them Oprah Winfrey, Pulitzer Prize-winning author David Remnick, and author and journalist Ta-Nehisi Coates.
"The first time I came face to face with Toni Morrison was in Maya Angelou’s backyard, for a gathering of some of the most illustrious black people you’ve ever heard of," Winfrey told a crowd of more than 600, remembering a celebration after Morrison won the Nobel Prize. "My head and my heart were swirling. "
Winfrey has chosen more books by Morrison than by any other author for her book club, she said. But Winfrey worried, at first, that Morrison's work was too demanding.
But Morrison gave Winfrey the confidence to choose those books: "'She said, 'That, my dear, is reading,'" Winfrey said.
“There was no distance between Toni Morrison and her words. She believed it was a writer's job to rip the veil off," said Winfrey, who drew the most applause of the evening. "Her words don’t permit the reader to down them quickly and forget them.
"They will not be ignored," she continued. "They can gut you, turn you upside down, make you think you don’t get it. You experience … a kind of emancipation, a liberation, an ascension to another level of understanding. "
When the crowd surpassed the cathedral's seating capacity, people clustered by entrances, craning their necks to catch a glimpse of the literary luminaries who spoke. Attendees snapped selfies and photos of the cathedral interior. The guest speakers, led by priests, arrived to rich organ music.
“Great novelists illuminate worlds we dimly know," said Remnick, the editor of The New Yorker magazine. "Great novels either open a door or they turn on the lights. Toni Morrison did it all. She opened the door and she turned on the lights. ”
Morrison often began her writing early in the morning but jotted down ideas throughout the day on a yellow notepad she kept close, said Angela Davis, an author, activist and academic who called Morrison her "big sister. "
But although Morrison focused constantly on her work, she was always present for her two sons and her friends, Davis added.
Honoring Morrison: Gathering honors author Toni Morrison and her efforts to preserve African-American history
Remembered: Author Toni Morrison, Nobel laureate, remembered for honoring history in Nyack and beyond
One of the greats: Toni Morrison was our greatest writer, and her stories about race our most essential
"She demonstrated a way of being in the world that allowed her to simultaneously inhabit multiple dimensions," Davis said. "She was never only partially paying attention. She was always 100% engaged. "
For author and professor Jesmyn Ward, the first woman to win two National Book Awards for fiction, Morrison's unflinching telling of the black experience was a sort of North Star.
"We wandering children heard Toni Morrison’s voice, and she saved us," Ward said. "Something in that absolute narrative presence in her sure voice communicated this: you are worthy to be seen, you are worthy to be heard. Even in your quietest moments, you are worthy of witness. "
Poet Kevin Young, who directs the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, said Morrison challenged him as he strove to find his own voice as an author. Once, when he was in college, Morrison visited his school to read from her masterwork, "Beloved. "
"My friends and I literally sat at her feet," Young said. "Of course, now and always, we all sit at her feet.
"She freed something in me," he added.
Morrison served many roles to the people around her, among them mentor, teacher, editor and mother, said American-Haitian novelist Edwidge Danticat. One of the more important ones, though, was friend, she said.
“You were the literary giant that was Toni Morrison, but to myself you were also Chloe Wofford,” Danticat said, calling Morrison by the author’s given name. “You allowed me to see both. You gave us both lullabies and battle cries. You urged us to be dangerously free. ”
Toni Morrison was born Chloe Ardelia Wofford on Feb. 18, 1931, in Lorain, Ohio, the second of four children, the daughter of a ship welder and a homemaker, the granddaughter of sharecroppers.
Though Lorain was an integrated town, it wasn’t immune from racism. When Morrison was a toddler, her parents fell behind on their $4 monthly rent, so their landlord set fire to their house — while they were in it. Morrison doesn't remember the fire, she told the Washington Post in 1993, but her father refused to be intimidated, and she later passed that lesson to the characters she created.
“She refused to allow racism to overcome her," Remnick said at the memorial. "She shaped how we thought, how we felt, what we read, what we teach, how we see each other and how we see this troubled country. ”
Life lessons, family stories and books were influences that shaped her into a visionary author whose gripping chronicles of the black experience inspired generations and rocketed her to critical achievement.
Morrison earned a bachelor’s degree in 1953 from Howard University, a historically black university in Washington, D. C. — and became known as Toni because "the people in Washington" couldn't pronounce her real name, she told NPR in 2015.
Morrison completed her master’s degree at Cornell University in 1955 and married Harold Morrison in 1958. They had two children, Ford and Slade, and divorced in 1964. She began teaching first at Texas Southern University, and then at Howard, beginning an academic career that would last five decades.
In 1967, she became the first black female fiction editor at Random House, where she published works by Muhammad Ali, Angela Davis, Gayl Jones, Chinua Achebe and Wole Soyinka. It was her second publishing job; the first was as a textbook editor in Syracuse, New York — a way to support the two children she was raising alone.
“She respected protest but she did not march. She edited," said Remnick at the service. "That was, for a time, her political work. ”
Her 1970 debut novel, “The Bluest Eye,” tells the story of a black adolescent who lives in a violent household — and wishes for blue eyes. It’s set in Morrison’s hometown, post-Great Depression, and has consistently landed on the American Library Association’s list of challenged books for the “controversial issues” it addresses.
“She does it with a prose so precise, so faithful to speech and so charged with pain and wonder that the novel becomes poetry,” John Leonard wrote in a November 1970 New York Times review.
“I have said ‘poetry,’” Leonard added. “But 'The Bluest Eye' is also history, sociology, folklore, nightmare and music. ”
Morrison’s writing became pioneering and prolific, earning her widespread critical acclaim. “Song of Solomon,” her third novel, won a National Book Critics Circle Award for Fiction. She won the 1988 Pulitzer Prize in fiction for her best-known work, “Beloved,” published in 1987.
“Beloved” is the first in an African American history trilogy that includes “Jazz,” which takes place in 1920s Harlem, and “Paradise,” an Oprah’s Book Club selection. The novel, which tells the story of an African American who escapes slavery, spent more than six months on the New York Times bestseller list in hardcover alone. Winfrey starred in the 1998 film adaption of the novel.
Morrison wrote 11 novels. Her other works include “Sula,” “Tar Baby,” “Love,” “A Mercy,” “Home,” and “God Help the Child. ”
“When I began, there was just one thing that I wanted to write about, which was the true devastation of racism in the most vulnerable, the most helpless unit in the society — a black female and a child,” she told the New York Times magazine in 1994. “I wanted to write about what it was like to be the subject of racism. It had a specificity that was damaging. ”

Morrison in 1993 became the first African-American woman to win the Nobel Prize in Literature.
The prize, she later said, was unexpected.
“I felt a lot of ‘we’ excitement,” Morrison told the New York Times Magazine in 1994. “I represented a whole world of women who either were silenced or who had never received the imprimatur of the established literary world. ”
Morrison joined Princeton University in 1989 as a humanities professor, retiring with emeritus status in 2006.
Though her career took her across the country and around the world, Morrison spent decades in Rockland County, where she lived when she died.

Morrison long called Grand View-on-Hudson home, even after her house there burned on Christmas Day 1993. Around 120 firefighters from two departments responded to the fire, the Associated Press reported, which gutted the four-story house but spared her manuscripts. Her son, Slade, who was alone in the house when the fire started, escaped unhurt. The house was rebuilt.
“People used to say, ‘How come you do so many things?’” Morrison told Publishers Weekly in 1987. “It never appeared to me that I was doing very much of anything; really everything I did was always about one thing, which is books. I was either editing them or writing them or reading them or teaching them, so it was very coherent. ”
Former President Barack Obama awarded Morrison the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2012.
“Toni Morrison was a national treasure, as good a storyteller, as captivating, in person as she was on the page,” Obama tweeted after her death. “Her writing was a beautiful, meaningful challenge to our conscience and our moral imagination. What a gift to breathe the same air as her, if only for a while. ”
Morrison’s final book, “The Source of Self-Regard: Selected Essays, Speeches and Meditations,” was published in February 2019.

Texto completo: Minced words were nowhere to be heard during a news conference Tuesday afternoon in the home clubhouse at NYSEG Stadium.
Binghamton Rumble Ponies owner John Hughes, City of Binghamton Mayor Richard David and State Sen. Fred Akshar slammed a plan put forth by Major League Baseball that would signal the end of minor league baseball in 42 cities in 2021.
It also suggested that the threat of Binghamton losing a Double-A team that has existed since 1992 is very real.
Hughes, David and Akshar talked about filthy-rich owners caring more about their bottom lines than the impact their proposal would have on dozens of small cities that have fielded minor-league teams for decades.
"Shame on the commissioner," Akshar said of Rob Manfred. "Shame on the commissioner. The fact that we would let a group of millionaires and billionaires turn small communities like ours on our heads is despicable, and it's motivated by one thing: greed."
Added Hughes: "Why is Binghamton on the list? The Major League Baseball proposal is clear about this being the first of many steps in cleaning out minor-league baseball from rural communities, working-class people who don't have the means or ability to drive three hours to pay several hundred dollars to watch a Major League Baseball game."
How we got here Stories broke over the weekend in the New York Times and New York Daily News about the "Houston plan."
This proposal would end Single-A short-season leagues – New York-Penn League, Northwest, Appalachian and Pioneer – move the draft from June to August and decrease the draft from 40 to 20 rounds. These changes would take place in 2021.
On its face, it wouldn't appear to affect Binghamton, which is home to the Double-A Rumble Ponies of the Eastern League. But it's been reported if the proposal passes, the New York Mets would assign their NY-Penn team, the Brooklyn Cyclones, to the Eastern League and Binghamton would be left without a team.
Hughes said he wasn't certain when a final vote on the proposal would be taken.
Are the Mets to blame? Last season, the Cyclones averaged 4,848 fans – tops in the league – en route to winning the NY-Penn title. The Rumble Ponies drew 3,000 fans per game, last in the Eastern League.
Given those numbers, it seems an easy call for the Mets to pick Brooklyn as their Double-A team, if the proposal passes.
But Akshar said Mets ownership should be in Binghamton's corner.
"I'm calling on the Wilpons to join this fight with us," Akshar said of the family that owns the New York Mets, who have had their Double-A team in Binghamton since 1992. "The Wilpons should be in John Hughes' corner, should be in the City of Binghamton's corner and the taxpayers' corner in upstate New York and do what is right, and to defend minor-league baseball in Binghamton.
"I'm not suggesting they haven't done that; I'm calling on them to do that if they haven't done that."
David concurred.
"(Mets owner) Jeff Wilpon came to this city to watch Tim Tebow (in 2018)," he said. "He made a commitment to this team. ... We've honored our commitment and look to him to be a supporter."
Why it's frustrating Taxpayers in New York, the City of Binghamton and Hughes have dropped $9.5 million into NYSEG Stadium since 2014.
Hughes rolled off a litany of items in the MLB proposal as reasons why small communities should not have minor league teams, but NYSEG Stadium and the City of Binghamton are in compliance with all of them.
Those items include the facility, transportation, location and hotel accommodations
"Given the status of all of the above set forth by Major League Baseball, we're in a strong position moving forward," Hughes said.
Akshar argued this is about cash, and not much of it, saying big-league teams would save an estimated $660,000 per season if the proposal passes.
"I'll use my Yankees as an example," he said. "They're worth over $4 billion, $660,000 is a rounding error, and you're talking about upending communities for a decimal point being the wrong place?
"At the end of the day, this is what this is about. This is about greed. Millionaires and billionaires making decisions that will not only upend this community but upend all the investments we have made here, and to destroy these little communities just to put more money in their pockets."
Binghamton has a Player Development Contract with the New York Mets that runs through 2022. But Hughes said if the Professional Baseball Contract – one that is negotiated every five years between Major League Baseball and the minor leagues (the current PBC expires in 2020) – changes, then the PDC would be nullified.
As for a "Dream League" that would serve as an independent league for undrafted players and free agents that was included in the proposal, Hughes called it a "nightmare."
Getting in the fight David said the city will fight the proposal.
Asked for specifics on what it could do to defeat the proposal, Hughes said, "I think there are a lot of things that can be done. I'm not willing to share those. We're still finalizing our internal plans as things move forward."
He went on to say, "No one is stealing hometown America baseball from (Binghamton) or any other city in America without a fight. This is a call to action for the people of Binghamton, all across the state of New York and America to join the fight to let local officials know and let Major League Baseball know that you support hometown baseball for America.
"The plan to rip these teams away, this is a direct threat on the future of baseball outside of the 30 cities that currently host Major League Baseball."
Akshar added: "The three of us are not going to do this alone. The call to action is for this community to step up. ... What this minor-league team means to this community is significant. We need the entire community, we need the Southern Tier to stand up."

National Book Awards Honor 'Trust Exercise'

Texto completo: Susan Choi won the National Book Award for fiction on Wednesday night for "Trust Exercise," a novel set in the 1980s at a competitive performing arts school, where two students fall in love. The judges praised the novel for blending "the intellectual rigor of post-modern technique with a story that is timely, mesmerizing, and in the end, unsettling."
Ms. Choi, a Pulitzer finalist in 2004 for her novel, "American Woman," said in an acceptance speech that she was still surprised and grateful to be able to write for a living.
"Given what we're all facing today and what many people are facing in an even more intense sense, I find it an astonishing privilege that this is what I get to do for a living," she said.
"Trust Exercise," Ms. Choi's fifth novel, was embraced by critics and tackles the issue of sexual consent. In the New York Times, Dwight Garner called it a "psychologically acute" book that "enlists your heart as well as your mind. Zing will go certain taut strings in your chest."
The award for nonfiction went to Sarah M. Broom for "The Yellow House," her memoir about her New Orleans home and how her family scattered after Hurricane Katrina. In an emotional acceptance speech, Ms. Broom credited her mother, who raised 12 children, for instilling in her a love of language. "She was always wolfing down words, insatiable," she said of her mother. "Which is how I learned the way words were a kind of sustenance."
The awards, now in their 70th year, were presented at a black-tie dinner at Cipriani Wall Street in New York, with more than 700 guests attending a ceremony hosted by the actor and literacy advocate LeVar Burton. The mood was buoyant, reflecting a relatively optimistic moment in the publishing industry, and the event was relatively free of controversy, in contrast with this year's other notable literary awards. In October, the Nobel committee was criticized for its decision to award the 2019 Nobel Prize in Literature to the Austrian writer Peter Handke, who has stoked outrage for his remarks defending Serbia's actions in the Balkan wars. The literary world was also divided over the Booker Prize this year, after judges decided to break their own rules and award it to two authors, Margaret Atwood and Bernardine Evaristo.
The National Book Award, established in 1950, is one of the most prestigious literary prizes in the United States.
[ A historian, two poets, a presidential biographer and two celebrated novelists were among the National Book Award winners whose lives The Times chronicled over the past two years. ]
This year's fiction finalists represented a stylistically and thematically diverse cross-section of contemporary literature, among them two debut authors: Kali Fajardo-Anstine, for her story collection "Sabrina & Corina," which explores the lives of Latinas in Colorado, and Julia Phillips, for her novel "Disappearing Earth," about two sisters who disappear in Russia's remote Kamchatka Peninsula. Also among the finalists were Marlon James, for his novel "Black Leopard, Red Wolf," and Laila Lalami, for her novel "The Other Americans."
Memoirs were heavily represented in the nonfiction category this year, occupying three of the five finalist spots. In addition to the winner, "The Yellow House," the finalists included the memoirs "Solitary," the memoir of Albert Woodfox, who spent more than four decades in solitary confinement, and Carolyn Forché's "What You Have Heard Is True: A Memoir of Witness and Resistance," a poet's recollection of her journeys to El Salvador. Those memoirs competed with Tressie McMillan Cottom's essay collection, "Thick," and David Treuer's history "The Heartbeat of Wounded Knee: Native America From 1890 to the Present."
The Hungarian writer László Krasznahorkai's novel "Baron Wenckheim's Homecoming" won the prize for translated literature, which he shared with his translator, Ottilie Mulzet. The category was added in 2018, opening the prize up to fiction and nonfiction works that are translated into English and published in the United States. This year's finalists in translated literature included works originally written in Arabic, Finnish, French and Japanese, among them the Yoko Ogawa novel, "The Memory Police," Khaled Khalifa's "Death Is Hard Work" and Scholastique Mukasonga's "The Barefoot Woman."
Martin W. Sandler won the prize for young people's literature for his book "1919 The Year That Changed America," an account of a tumultuous year of labor strikes, Prohibition and women's suffrage. The poetry prize went to Arthur Sze for his collection "Sight Lines." "We need poetry now more than ever," Mr. Sze said, calling it "an essential language."
The novelist, essayist and critic Edmund White received the award for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters, an award that has in previous years gone to literary legends like Toni Morrison, Ray Bradbury and Stephen King. Mr. White, who is best known for his works "A Boy's Own Story" and "The Beautiful Room Is Empty," was an early pioneer of gay literature and helped to bring stories centered on same-sex couples into the mainstream.
Accepting the award, which was presented by the actor and director John Waters, Mr. White described how he struggled to get his novels published because they featured gay characters.
"My gay subject matter was offensive especially because I didn't write about hustlers or criminals or drag queens, but rather about the middle-class guy sharing an office with you," he said.
The Literarian Award, which recognizes service to the literary community, was awarded to Oren Teicher, the former chief executive of the American Booksellers Association, a nonprofit trade organization. The award was presented by the novelist Ann Patchett, who co-owns an independent bookstore in Nashville and noted that Mr. Teicher has a tradition of working at the counters of independent stores during the holidays. "This is a guy who knows how to sell a book," she said.

Google Limits 'Microtargeting' Of Audiences for Political Ads

Texto completo: The company said the ads would not be directed specifically to audiences based on their public voter records or political affiliations.
SAN FRANCISCO -- Google will restrict how precisely political advertisers can target an audience on its online services, the company announced on Wednesday in a move that shook up the digital plans for campaigns during the 2020 presidential election.
Political advertisers will be able to aim their messages at people based on their age, gender or location. Google will also allow ads to be targeted to people based on the content of websites they visit. However, the ads can no longer be directed to specific audiences based on their public voter records or political affiliations categorized as "left-leaning," "right-leaning," or "independent," the company said in a blog post.
The policy will apply to ads shown to users of Google's search engine and YouTube, as well as display advertisements sold by the company that appear on other websites.
The decision left political strategists stunned and scrambling to react. Modern political campaigns have relied on the tools and data offered by technology giants like Google and Facebook, which dominate the online ad industry. The campaigns have been able to cater different messages for potential voters based on signals such as political leanings, what articles they have read, what videos they have watched and what things they have searched for.
Instead of blanketing an entire city with a costly TV spot, the so-called microtargeting of political ads has become controversial because it allows advertisers to seek out specific voters and perhaps avoid broader scrutiny of their messages.
"This will align our approach to election ads with long-established practices in media such as TV, radio and print, and result in election ads being more widely seen and available for public discussion," wrote Scott Spencer, a vice president on Google's ads team.
Tech companies face increased criticism over how they handle political speech, including advertisements. Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, has been accused of amplifying disinformation, hate speech and violent content. But he has said he would not block political ads containing false statements, despite rising pressure, particularly from Democrats, to do so.
Last month, Twitter announced that it would prohibit all political ads from its service. Twitter's move was largely seen as a response to the controversy caused by Facebook.
The debate about political ads was thrust into the spotlight after Facebook and Google did not take down a 30-second video ad from the Trump campaign that made a false claim about interactions with Ukraine involving Joseph R. Biden Jr., the former vice president and a Democratic presidential contender.
Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump's campaign manager, lashed out on Twitter at Google for the policy change, accusing political elites and big tech of wanting to "rig the election" and said they "won't stop until they control all digital political speech." Earlier in the day, the Trump campaign also criticized Facebook in a tweet for considering changes to its political advertising policy, saying it "wants to take important tools away from us for 2020."
Tom Channick, a Facebook spokesman, said the company was "looking at different ways we might refine our approach to political ads."
Google said while it had never allowed any advertiser -- including politicians -- to make false assertions, it was clarifying its policy to explicitly ban ads that make "demonstrably false claims that could significantly undermine participation or trust" in the election process. Google noted, however, that it expects to take action on a "very limited" number of political ads. Michael Posner, a professor at New York University's Stern School of Business, said Google's policy change was a good start but did not go far enough in dealing with potential misinformation.
"It feels too much like a lawyer looking for language to give the company a lot of latitude," Mr. Posner said.
Google said it would introduce the new policies within a week in Britain, ahead of the country's general election, and then to the United States and the rest of the world in January, shortly before the Iowa caucuses. The company said the ad policy would include any candidates or officeholders of state or federal elected office.
In an email to campaigns, Google outlined the new rules in greater detail, including that election ads will no longer be allowed to target what is called "affinity audiences" that look like other groups that campaigns might want to target. Campaigns can also no longer upload their own lists of people to show ads.
In addition, there will be no more of what is known as "remarketing," the process of serving ads to people who have previously taken an action like visiting a campaign's website.
"It eliminates our ability to target based on any personal information," said Danielle Butterfield, paid media director for Priorities USA, a leading Democratic super PAC that has announced plans to spend more than $ 100 million, much of it online.
Keegan Goudiss, a Democratic digital strategist, worried about the implications beyond campaigns. "We are quickly transitioning to a world where corporate communications is prioritized over anything deemed 'political,"' he said. "That's dangerous for democracy."
Unhappiness was spread across both sides of the aisle.
Michael Duncan, a Republican digital strategist, called the announcement a "horrible" move that "that will hurt cash-strapped grass-roots campaigns," which often rely on microtargeting to find success.
"They're placating a mob that will never be satisfied & undermining the foundation of the Internet economy," Mr. Duncan wrote on Twitter.

Texto completo: a dismissive eye roll from Generation Z to their elders - is suddenly all the rage. It appears on hoodies, headlines, tweets and memes, this catch-all response to old folks' nonstop nagging and criticism. Some members of the Baby Boom generation are not amused.
Maureen Dowd of the New York Times sees it as "intergenerational war." Steve Cuozzo of the New York Post says the young ones "really, really hate us." Bob Lonsberry, a conservative radio host, declared "boomer" - no joke - "the n-word of ageism."
I, for one, can't say I really feel "hate" from young folks. But to whatever degree I should be taking this seriously, I find that I can't. I keep laughing instead.
It strikes me as funny that some in my generation, which defined itself by an insolent rejection of the old, are traumatized by a younger generation's insolent rejection of us. Am I the only one who remembers when the hippies warned, "Don't trust anyone over 30?" Does no one else recall when Pete Townshend sneered, "Hope I die before I get old"?
Then how dare any of us clutch our pearls over a little intergenerational sniping? Besides, it's not as if the kids don't have a point. Our record is certainly mixed.
I'd say our music was better than theirs, but they have better television - and more of it - than we could've dreamt. Boomers made great strides in civil rights for black people, women and the LGBTQ. But we dropped the ball on climate change, failed to address a rigged financial system. And we - the white cohort of us at least - bear blame for the catastrophe of Trump. We deserve both credit and castigation. Every generation does - even the "Greatest."
When I was a kid, I used to tease this old man in the neighborhood for being an old man in the neighborhood. "Keep a'livin'," he'd always retort. And I did. And here I am, just turned 62 and wondering how the heck that happened. The Gen Z kids will too soon enough wonder the selfsame thing. The big wheel keeps on turning.
I'm remembering teenage battles with my mom as I write this. As it happens, I've got Nat King Cole playing in the background. He was mom's end-all and be-all. She didn't want to hear any noise from my room about P-Funk getting funked up, Papa being a rolling stone or midnight trains to Georgia. As far as she was concerned, music stopped when King Cole died. I got sick of hearing his name, scorned him on general principle.
But I remember one day mom deigned to listen to the Stylistics with me. Afterward, she sniffed that "Betcha By Golly Wow" was actually a pretty song to have such a silly title. It was a backhanded compliment, but I felt vindicated by it just the same. I doubt she needed my vindication. Still, somewhere in the intervening decades, I decided Cole wasn't so bad either.
So the kids may "OK" this Boomer to their heart's content. As they will eventually discover, that old man in my neighborhood was right. Keep a'livin' indeed.

Texto completo: Two weeks after regaining control of their playoff fate, the Philadelphia Eagles returned from their off week and lost it again.
Their 17-10 defeat Sunday against the New England Patriots, coupled with the Dallas Cowboys' 35-27 win over the Detroit Lions, knocked the Eagles (5-5) back into second place in the NFC East and lessened their wild-card chances considerably.
Including Dallas, seven NFC teams have better records than the Eagles. One of them, the Seattle Seahawks (8-2), visits Philadelphia on Sunday. Another, the Minnesota Vikings (8-3), already have beaten the Eagles, giving them the first tiebreaker if it comes down to those two teams for the second of two wild-card spots.
According to the New York Times, the Eagles' playoff chances now stand at just 39%.
Also ahead of the Eagles in the playoff chase are the New Orleans Saints (8-2), Green Bay Packers (8-2), San Francisco 49ers (9-1) and Los Angeles Rams (6-4).
The bottom line is this: There are six playoff spots and five teams with at least eight wins - none in the NFC East. The division is the Eagles' door to the postseason.
A big problem for the Eagles is that they came back from their off week less healthy than before. Wide receiver Alshon Jeffery (ankle) and running back Jordan Howard (shoulder) weren't able to recover despite the extra rest, and their absences were felt in Sunday's loss.
Running back Darren Sproles then suffered a torn hip flexor in his first full practice after the extended break and was lost for the season.
Then during the game, right tackle Lane Johnson suffered a concussion.
Jeffery, Howard and Johnson's availability remain in question heading into the Seattle game.
The Eagles also lost to Dallas in their first meeting. Their rematch is scheduled for Dec. 22 in Philadelphia.

Texto completo: The Philadelphia Flyers have Gritty, the New York Mets have Mr.Met and the Boston Red Sox have Wally the Green Monster.But some mascots are the real deal.
Consider, for instance, Ralphie V, a buffalo who has been the mascot for the University of Colorado's Buffaloes for a dozen seasons.The tradition of having a live buffalo lead the team onto the football field is in its 53rd season. Age has not slowed Ralphie V, and that's become a problem, said AD Rick George, said.
"With past Ralphies, as they aged, their speed typically decreased,"the university said in a statement. "With Ralphie V, she has been so excited to run, that she was actually running too fast, which created safety concerns for her and her handlers."
As a result, the university announced that Ralphie V will be retiring to a ranch where she will live with other buffaloes and be replaced with another buffalo, who will be named Ralphie VI.
Ralphie V was not consistently responding to cues from her handlers, the university said, adding that "her temperament was such that she was held back from leading the team out for CU's last two home games against USC and Stanford."
In the team's history, five buffaloes have led the players onto the field 296 times at Folsom Field in Colorado and 355 times in other games.There were only 13 times in which the Colorado Buffaloes were not led onto the field by a buffalo.
Ralphie V will make her last appearance on Nov.23 during the final home game of the season. She will not run but her "career will be celebrated,"the university said.

Media and Democrats agree: The impeachment witnesses have 'impeccable' credentials

Texto completo: It is not enough for newsrooms to report simply on the professional and personal backgrounds of the House's key impeachment witnesses, including Ambassador William Taylor, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent, and former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch.

Reporters and commentators have taken it upon themselves to also act as character witnesses for these supposedly faultless public servants, praising them up-and-down for their allegedly “impeccable” credentials and records.

Get used to that word, “impeccable.” You are going to see that a lot in the following paragraphs from not just members of the press, but also Democratic lawmakers.

CNN commentator and former Department of Homeland Security official Jack Tomarchio, for example, said on Oct. 23 that Taylor's record is "impeccable."

MSNBC co-host Mike Barnacle said the next day that Taylor has "impeccable credentials.”

“Bill Taylor, Marie Yovanovitch — people whose reputations remain impeccable,” NBC News’ Peter Alexander declared on Oct. 24.

The Daily Beast’s Jonathan Alter said two days later that Taylor had an “impeccable career.”

Vindman is a man of “impeccable character,” MSNBC commentator and former assistant U.S. attorney Mimi Rocah said on Oct. 28.

CNN’s Don Lemon declared that same day that Vindman has “impeccable credentials.”

The New York Times' Maggie Haberman said on Oct. 29 on CNN that Vindman's credentials are “impeccable.”

“He seems like an impeccably credentialed ... person,” the New Yorker’s Jeffrey Toobin agreed.

Let’s pause here to focus on the fact that this “impeccable” language mirrors exactly how Democratic lawmakers have promoted their impeachment witnesses.

Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, for example, said on MSNBC on Oct. 22 that Taylor has "impeccable credentials.”

The impeachment witnesses, and foreign service agents in general, have "impeccable records of honesty and scholarship,” Democratic Rep. Steve Cohen of Tennessee said on CNN on Nov. 6.

On Nov. 11, Democratic Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York said on CNN that Taylor is a diplomat of "impeccable credentials.”

On CNN, Democratic Rep. Eliot Engel of New York said on Nov. 13 that the impeachment witnesses have "impeccable records.”

Now, back to the matter of the national press and its portrayal of Vindman and company. (Fox News, of course, represents the odd man out. It is the only network whose hosts and guests routinely question the motives of the impeachment witnesses. CNN’s Sean Duffy also attacked Vindman’s character, for which Duffy was savaged by his colleagues.)

Newsweek noted on Oct. 29 that Vindman’s testimony regarding President Trump’s efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden was expected to carry a great deal of weight given the lieutenant colonel’s “impeccable resume.”

Foreign Policy’s Elias Groll and Amy Mackinnon reported around that time that Vindman is a man with an "impeccable resume.”

Washington Times columnist Donald Lambro said on Nov. 1 that Vindman has an “impeccable career record.”

CNN senior political reporter Nia-Malika Henderson said on Nov. 7 that those who have come forward to testify against the president have “impeccable credentials.”

Taylor has an "impeccable resume,” stressed CNN legal analyst Michael Zeldin on Nov. 10.

The next day, the New York Times’ Michelle Goldberg stated on MSNBC that the four key witnesses, Kent, Taylor, Vindman, and Yovanovitch, are “people with kind of impeccable national security credentials.”

On Nov. 13, CNN contributor Julian Epstein said Taylor's and Kent's credentials are "impeccable.”

The same day, CNN’s Henderson declared once that the impeachment witnesses "obviously" have "impeccable resumes.”

The Associated Press’ Jonathan Lemire declared the next day on MSNBC that the impeachment witnesses have “impeccable reputations.”

The New York Times’ Goldberg wrote on Nov. 14 that Taylor and Kent are two State Department officials with “impeccable credentials.”

On Nov. 15, MSNBC’s Nicole Wallace declared that Yovanovitch is an “impeccable witness.”

Three days later, NBC legal analyst Danny Cevallos said the four witnesses “generally have impeccable credentials.”

It is possible that members of the press decided independently of one another to use the exact same language as Democratic lawmakers to defend all of these impeachment witnesses. It is far more likely that one person in the media heard a Democrat use the term "impeccable" in relation to Vindman and company, and then groupthink, which plagues newsrooms from here to Los Angeles, did the rest.

DOJ inspector general finds 'numerous issues' with FBI management of secret sources

Texto completo: A newly released assessment from the Justice Department watchdog found "numerous issues" related to the FBI's validation processes for secret sources.
The audit, published Tuesday by DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz, comes amid intense scrutiny of the Justice Department's and FBI's actions during the 2016 election.
"Ineffective management and oversight of confidential sources can result in jeopardizing FBI operations and placing FBI agents, sources, subjects of investigation, and the public in harm's way," Horowitz said in a two-minute video.
Multiple confidential human sources were used in the counterintelligence investigation of the Trump campaign, including Cambridge professor Stefan Halper, who met with Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos accompanied by a woman posing as his assistant, Azra Turk. Horowitz was looking into whether Halper, who made contact with other Trump campaign officials, exceeded his mandate.
British ex-spy Christopher Steele, whose salacious dossier on President Trump was used by the bureau to justify surveillance of the Trump campaign, was also a confidential human source to the FBI. Steele was cut off as an FBI source in November 2016, following the discovery that he had been improperly providing information to journalists while working with them, but he remained in contact with the bureau through a back channel facilitated by Justice Department official Bruce Ohr.
The partially redacted audit generally covers fiscal 2012 to May 2019 and is yet another critical assessment of the FBI under the tenure of Director James Comey, who was fired in May 2017. Comey has spoken out, denying Attorney General William Barr's assertion that "spying did occur" on the Trump campaign. He wrote in a New York Times op-ed that Trump's "amoral" leadership had corrupted Barr.
Confidential human sources are hired for a litany of missions, not just counterintelligence. They also collect intelligence and investigative information while being embedded in terrorist cells and violent gangs.
The 63-page report on the FBI's management of validation processes determined there was a "backlog of long-term" sources of five years or more. Validation is defined as "vetting the credibility of a CHS and assessing the veracity of the information the source provides." Horowitz's staff interviewed more than 100 FBI officials at field offices in Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia, as well as relevant officials at the Justice Department and another Intelligence Community agency.
Investigators found the FBI and the Justice Department's review committee failed to comply with attorney general guidelines requiring timely validation. "By not timely reviewing long-term CHSs for continued use, the FBI risks retaining active CHSs who should have been closed for cause," said a press release accompanying the audit.
Investigators also uncovered issues with FBI employees who conducted validation reviews, noting they did not "review the full scope" of a long-term source's work for the FBI. "Moreover, FBI employees conducting CHS validation reviews told us they were discouraged from documenting conclusions and recommendations arising from the validation process," Horowitz's team said.
Among other problems found was a lack of adequate oversight from FBI headquarters, insufficiently clear guidance on communications so that agents and sources are not "put in harm's way," and issues "related to the FBI’s ability to align its CHSs with its highest threat priorities."
"Specifically, we found that the FBI lacked an automated process to analyze the threat areas in which it has CHS coverage and relied on an ineffective process that could result in outdated information," Horowitz's team said. "In addition, we found that a proposed automated system being developed would rely on data from several other FBI systems, including its CHS system of record which has known issues related to data quality."
The FBI's electronic record-keeping system for CHS management, called Delta, was determined to not only be inadequate for the FBI, but also hindered the inspector general's ability to obtain information stemming from his requests. Instead, the watchdog audit said an FBI official "was able to manually create a partial spreadsheet" of the requested data.
Horowitz's report made 16 recommendations to assist the Justice Department and FBI to improve the CHS program and said they agreed with all of them and have "started corrective measures."
"We agree it is important to continue to improve the validation process to ensure compliance with the AG Guidelines," Suzanne Turner, an FBI section chief in the inspection division, wrote to Horowitz on Sept. 24.

Not included or redacted in the report are specific details about confidential sources, including the number retained by the FBI, but it does show that the bureau spent a yearly average of $42 million on the collective group between fiscal 2012 and 2018.
The report comes one week after lawmakers wrote Horowitz seeking an investigation into the "nature and scope" of Michigan resident William Reilly's work for the FBI as a counterterrorism source and the circumstances leading up to his death in Ukraine in July 2015 after traveling to Moscow.
The audit was released ahead of another highly anticipated report from Horowitz: The findings from his year-and-a-half investigation into alleged Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuses related to the 2016 presidential election.
Trump's GOP allies claim Horowitz's findings will show top Justice Department and FBI officials misled the FISA court by using an unverified dossier compiled by Steele to obtain warrants to monitor onetime Trump campaign adviser Carter Page electronically. Democrats, as well as current and former FBI officials, have dismissed allegations of wrongdoing and have raised concerns that information about U.S. intelligence-gathering could be weaponized to discredit special counsel Robert Mueller.
Horowitz's findings in the FISA report, which Barr said last week was "imminent" following a classification review and final session for witnesses to provide feedback, could be useful for U.S. Attorney John Durham, who is conducting a criminal inquiry into the origins of the Russia investigation. Horowitz is scheduled to testify about his FISA investigation before the Senate Judiciary Committee next month.

The attorney general of Washington, D.C., is suing food-delivery company DoorDash Inc. for pocketing tips on deliveries, the attorney general's office said Tuesday.
DoorDash previously guaranteed workers a minimum amount for each delivery. When customers electronically added a tip to their total bill, the company put that payment toward the guaranteed minimum the worker receives, rather than increasing the payment by the amount of the tip.
The company "misled customers, who reasonably believed that their tips would go to workers," D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine said in prepared remarks.
The attorney general is seeking a court order to force DoorDash to surrender the tips and pay civil penalties.
The D.C. attorney general's office started investigating the company in March and looked at DoorDash's operations over more than two years up to September 2019.
It said its investigation "confirmed that DoorDash used consumer tips to offset the company's payment to workers" and that while the company encouraged tipping, workers were still paid the same most of the time.
"We strongly disagree with and are disappointed by the action taken today," a DoorDash spokesperson said in an emailed statement. "We believe the assertions made in the complaint are without merit and we look forward to responding to them through the legal process."
The company's payment structure faced criticism following a July story in The New York Times.
Earlier this year, DoorDash said it would change its tipping policy and that the money its delivery people made in tips would be equivalent to what customers tipped on orders and that their profits would rise on average.

Backlash for Obama From the Left

Texto completo: He feels liberated to weigh in on 2020 despite the online backlash, people close to him say.
Did Barack Obama just cancel himself?
That's the question an editor here asked me on Saturday, as we watched comments Mr. Obama had made about the 2020 race reverberate across social media.
In case you missed it: Mr. Obama expressed some thoughts at a meeting of wealthy donors in Washington on Friday night. Aides billed the event as a chance for him to calm some of the anxiety that establishment party types are expressing about the Democratic field. Mr. Obama did that, reminding them of how brutal his primary fight was against Hillary Clinton in 2008 -- and, hey, that turned out O.K., right?
Then, Mr. Obama's remarks veered into his own worries about the field.
"I don't think we should be deluded into thinking that the resistance to certain approaches to things is simply because voters haven't heard a bold enough proposal and if they hear something as bold as possible then immediately that's going to activate them," he said. "People rightly are cautious because they don't have a lot of margin for error."
"This is still a country that is less revolutionary than it is interested in improvement," he added. "They like seeing things improved, but the average American doesn't think we have to completely tear down the system and remake it."
No one was mentioned by name. While Mr. Obama has spoken privately with nearly all the candidates, he's been very careful to avoid even the appearance of influencing the race.
But it was pretty clear who Mr. Obama was talking about this time -- Senators Elizabeth Warren ("big, structural change") and Bernie Sanders ("political revolution").
I was covering his remarks and there wasn't much reaction from the room at the time. But by the next morning, tweets were flying, a hashtag had been created -- people proudly proclaimed they were #TooFarLeft -- and voters, activists and strategists were chattering.
And, boy, did they have plenty to say. Mr. Obama got a resounding chorus of "O.K. boomer" from liberal activists, who questioned his record on issues like health care, climate change and immigration.
Of course, as readers of this newsletter know, Twitter is not real life. The views of Democrats on social media often bear little resemblance to those in the wider electorate. Twitter Democrats are whiter, more liberal and more politically active, according to a New York Times analysis from earlier this year.
People close to the former president say he wasn't bothered by the reaction. At this point in his life, he feels liberated to give what he sees as his best advice to his fellow Democrats based on his political experiences.
And he's giving voice to concerns from moderates that have been bubbling up for several weeks now as Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders have shown resilience in the polls. But Mr. Obama's sentiments are in direct conflict with what the more liberal activists who have an outsize role in the party's politics and the nominating process have been expressing.
Still, it's worth noting that my colleague Jenny Medina was at the California Democratic Convention in Long Beach on Saturday -- and none of the political types she spoke to had seen the Twitter backlash to Mr. Obama's comments.
If Mr. Obama was right about one thing, it's that the disconnect between the wings of the party is real.

I want to know what you all think about Mr. Obama's remarks.
Is he right that Democrats are playing risky politics by pushing to the left? Or, is his brand of more centrist politics simply not meeting today's "fierce urgency of now?"

Democrats don't think impeachment helped them win
Democrats scored a big victory in a second red state over the weekend, when Gov. John Bel Edwards won re-election by more than 40,000 votes in Louisiana. His victory came less than two weeks after another Democratic win, a narrow one in the Kentucky governor's race.
President Trump had invested political capital in both off-year races, seeing potential Republican victories as a way to steady his political footing amid the drumbeat of impeachment news.
In rallies before the elections, he cast the contests as a referendum on himself.
"You got to give me a big win, please, O.K.," the president pleaded with his supporters last Thursday in Bossier City, La.
Yet, officials on both sides of the aisle said those Democratic victories came in spite of the impeachment inquiry -- not because of it.
"It was not a help," Gov. Gina Raimondo of Rhode Island, who was deeply involved with all three races as head of the Democratic Governors Association, told me on Sunday evening. "Candidly, it made it more difficult, if anything."
We've spent a lot of time analyzing how impeachment may be affecting our politics. These two races give us the start of an answer.
For months, Speaker Nancy Pelosi refused to start House impeachment proceedings, pointing to the reluctance of her members who had flipped more moderate, suburban districts in the midterms, handing Democrats control of the chamber.
Now we have some evidence for the political rationale behind her hesitation: In deeply conservative states like Louisiana and Kentucky, which Mr. Trump won in 2016 by 20 points and 30 points, the House impeachment process rallied his base, according to Ms. Raimondo -- encouraging Mr. Trump's voters to turn out and defend him.
But any Republican backlash against impeachment wasn't enough to elevate the Republican candidates who had tied themselves to Mr. Trump. In these two governor's races, the pro-Trump turnout was still smaller than the coalition of African-Americans and moderate whites in suburbs and cities energized to come out and support the Democrats, who were well known in their states. (Republicans did pick up a win in the Mississippi governor's election.)
That dynamic happening in conservative states should be a big, flashing danger sign for the president, who will be fighting for his re-election in far more purple places.
Much of the outcome of the 2020 race is likely to depend on whether either party -- or an event like the impeachment inquiry -- is able to alter that balance.

Texto completo: Editor’s note: This is the Nov. 15, 2019 edition of the Inside the Dodgers newsletter. To receive the newsletter in your inbox, sign up here.
I broke the story of Andrew Toles’ promotion to the big leagues in the summer of 2016. One thing I didn’t include in any of my reporting at the time was this text message from a Dodgers staffer: “that could end poorly.”
The story of Toles’ career with the Dodgers hasn’t technically ended. He’s still under contract to the team, but he spent all of 2019 on the restricted list and did not play. The reason for his absence was never revealed; we only knew that Toles had the support of the organization while he was away. For a player who joined the team in a cloud of mystery, it was an appropriate fadeout to the decade.
The Dodgers were well aware of his question marks when they signed Toles as a minor league free agent. They knew Toles had been disciplined by two different college programs — kicked off the University of Tennessee baseball team in 2011 and suspended by Chipola College in 2012. They knew the Tampa Bay Rays expelled Toles from his Single-A team following a blow-up with his manager in May 2014. They knew all this because the GM who drafted and developed Toles with the Rays was none other than the Dodgers’ Andrew Friedman.
Toles’ second chance in professional baseball went much better than his first. Fast-tracked from Single-A to the majors in 2016, Toles slashed .314/.365/.505 in 48 regular season games. By October, he had ramrodded his way into the starting outfield. Toles started four of six NLCS games against the Cubs that year, going 6 for 13 (.462) with a pair of doubles. At 24 years old, Toles had made the leap from prospect, to failed prospect, to starting outfielder on a playoff team. The transformation landed him in the pages of the New York Times.
The following winter, the Dodgers jettisoned their de facto left fielder, Howie Kendrick, paving the way for Toles to seize regular playing time in 2017. However, a knee injury in May promptly ended his season. His absence on the field would have been more conspicuous without the emergence of Chris Taylor. Still, by 2018, Toles was healthy and competing for a job in spring training. There was a pathway for him to regain his standing on the depth chart.
By the final week of camp, Toles and Joc Pederson were in the running for the final outfield job. Pederson went 8 for 54 during the Cactus League season. Toles went 15 for 53. Pederson won the job anyway, and Toles began the season in Triple-A. There, a hamstring injury cost him two months. He batted .306 at Oklahoma City but never cracked a Dodger outfield rotation that now featured a rejuvenated Pederson and Matt Kemp, in addition to Chris Taylor, Kiké Hernandez and Yasiel Puig. On Sept. 29 in San Francisco, Toles singled and stole second base against the Giants. He hasn’t batted in a major league game since.
Judging only what he did on the field, Toles deserves some extolling. His postseason at-bats, limited though they were, look impressive in the context of the decade. His .792 regular-season OPS compares surprisingly well with the Dodgers’ other outfielders of the last 10 years. His effort in the outfield and on the bases was at least as impressive as hit bat. Ironically, Toles’ hard-nosed efforts landed him in the operating room and derailed his early promise perhaps as much as anything. Toles is still only 27 years old. But without knowing the substance of his off-the-field issue(s), it’s hard to say anything definitive about his future in baseball.
All we have for now are memories of one of the game’s best personalities, a talented athlete who offered tantalizing glimpses on the field. Who else points at a mean-mugging Chase Utley and says, unironically, “I wake up in the morning and I’m like, ‘how can I be like Chase Utley today?’ ” Who else admits he checked FanGraphs to see when he’d get called up from Triple-A? Who else, while being unable to walk, says (also unironically), “I’m pretty much healthy right now … besides my knee”? No one, that’s who. You can tell the story off the 2010s Dodger teams without Andrew Toles, but it wouldn’t be nearly as fun.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Gordon Sondland seemed to feast on his newfound political power when he snagged a plum ambassadorship and landed in Brussels as America's top diplomat to the European Union.
USA TODAY explains
What to expect this week as eight key witnesses prepare to tell their stories. 2A
Appointed to the post by President Donald Trump after he donated $1 million to the president's inaugural committee, Sondland had a direct line to the Oval Office. And he wasn't shy, or even careful, about using it.
He apparently flaunted his ability to dial Trump's phone number at will and told more seasoned administration officials to move aside as he usurped their portfolios – particularly when it came to Ukraine, even though it's not part of the EU.
Now, Sondland's relationship with Trump and his extensive dealings with Ukraine have put the former hotelier, and his boss, in a precarious position. On Wednesday, Sondland takes center stage in the House Democrats' impeachment inquiry when he gives public testimony before the House Intelligence Committee. For impeachment investigators, he is a unique witness; he was Trump's point man in the effort to push politically motivated investigations in Ukraine, and he seemed to have the most extensive, direct dealings with the president on the matter.
"Sondland will be the first individual in this inquiry to give open testimony about direct contacts with Mr. Trump on the issue of the investigations, military assistance (to Ukraine) and the relationship with Zelensky," said Aaron David Miller, a top State Department negotiator for past presidents of both parties and now a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
"Whether he chooses to open the door to further teasers I don't know," Miller said.
The wealthy Portland hotelier has already told lawmakers he relayed a quid pro quo to a top Ukraine official, telling him U.S. military aid to Ukraine was likely contingent on a public statement by Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, committing to the investigations Trump wanted. These included one into former Vice President Joe Biden and another into a debunked theory about Ukraine's involvement in 2016 election interference.
Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, likened Sondland's diplomatic agenda to a "drug deal." Bolton's deputy, Fiona Hill, portrayed him as a dangerously uninformed and unconventional diplomat.
Now, new evidence emerged during last week's first public impeachment hearing that makes Sondland an even more intriguing witness for House Democrats.
The top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, Bill Taylor, revealed Nov. 13 that one of his deputies overheard Sondland chatting with the president on July 26 while they were in a restaurant in Kiev.
In that cellphone call, "the member of my staff could hear President Trump on the phone asking Ambassador Sondland about "the investigations," Taylor recounted during the House Intelligence Committee's first public impeachment hearing. "Ambassador Sondland told President Trump that the Ukrainians were ready to move forward."
After the call, Taylor's aide asked Sondland what Trump thought about Ukraine. "Ambassador Sondland responded that President Trump cares more about the investigations of Biden" than he does about Ukraine, Taylor recounted.
House Democrats interviewed Taylor's aide during a closed-door session on Friday. David Holmes told lawmakers Sondland assured Trump that Zelensky "loves your ass" and would do "anything you ask him to" when asked about investigations he sought, according to his opening statement obtained by CNN and confirmed by The New York Times.
Holmes testified, "I then heard President Trump ask, 'So, he's gonna do the investigation?' Ambassador Sondland replied that 'he's gonna do it,' adding that President Zelensky will do 'anything you ask him to.'"
Trump told reporters on Nov. 13 that he didn't remember any Kiev phone call with Sondland.
"I know nothing about that. First time I've heard it," the president said, adding that there was no quid pro quo "pure and simple."
The day before the call with Sondland, on July 25, Trump pressed Zelensky to open the two investigations during a phone call that triggered a whistleblower complaint alleging that Trump had solicited foreign interference in the 2020 election. That allegation is the focus of the House Democrats' investigation.
Even before the Nov. 13 revelation, Sondland had told lawmakers a White House visit for Zelensky – something the Ukrainian leader desperately wanted as a public demonstration of U.S. support – would be granted only after Zelensky publicly committed to the investigations Trump, and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, were demanding. Sondland also told the House panel that he "presumed" U.S. military assistance was linked to a public Zelensky statement because there was no other credible explanation for a delay in that aid.
Sondland offered that testimony in a Nov. 4 addendum he submitted to the House Democrats after his initial closed-door interview. He said testimony from other witnesses had refreshed his memory about his dealings with Ukrainian officials.
Taylor's new information links Trump even more directly to the Ukraine pressure campaign. It also raises fresh questions about Sondland's diplomatic portfolio and qualifications.
"He's not someone who is trained either in the art of diplomacy or in the practicalities of information security," said Ned Price, a former CIA counterterrorism analyst. Price noted that in Sondland's initial closed-door testimony, he seemed to minimize the president's role in Ukraine by failing, for example, to mention the July 26 call and the link between U.S. military aid and the Biden investigation.
"I think he faces a decision as to if he wants to betray his political benefactor, or if he wants to risk his own reputation," said Price, who also was a National Security Council adviser under President Barack Obama. "Obviously he's going to be facing a lot of pressure because it's either him or Trump."
Trump has moved to distance himself from Sondland in recent days. "I hardly know the gentleman," he told reporters on Nov. 8. Before Sondland testified, Trump called Sondland "a really good man and great American" in a tweet.
Price and others say Sondland's July26 call with Trump raises red flags for another reason: It was likely a highly compromising security breach, and illustrates how lax Sondland was about following State Department protocols to protect sensitive information.
"The president is the most lucrative intelligence target throughout the world," Price said. "When the Russians presumably heard that he was connected to the president of the United States, they knew they had hit the jackpot."
Even before Wednesday's new disclosures, other witnesses had raised questions about Sondland's security practices and his unorthodox approach to diplomacy. Text messages and other testimony shows that Sondland spent months relaying Trump and Giuliani's demands to Ukrainian officials and other U.S. diplomats. Sondland has said he got his authority and instructions from Trump and Giuliani.
Before he amended his testimony, Sondland had told lawmakers there was "no quid pro quo" and that Trump relayed that to him directly.
"There is no quid pro. The president repeated, no quid pro. No quid pro quo multiple times," Sondland told lawmakers during his closed-door deposition Oct. 17. "This was a very short call. And I recaIl that the president was really in a bad mood."
But in his three-page amendment, Sondland said he recalled a Sept. 1 meeting in Warsaw with Andriy Yermak, a top aide to Zelensky, in which he said aid wouldn't resume without investigations. "After that large meeting, I now recall speaking individually with Mr. Yermak, where I said that resumption of U.S. aid would likely not occur until Ukraine provided the public anti-corruption statement that we had been discussing for many weeks," he said.

Texto completo: A felon convicted of shooting an NYPD cop in the 1990s and busted this month for three illegal firearms is back out on the streets, the Daily News has learned.
Stathos Huginnie, 43, was released from Rikers Island on Saturday after making $5,000 bail, court records show. He's facing multiple drugs and weapons charges after he was allegedly found with heroin and three defaced pistols.
Huginnie was released in 2017 after serving nearly 19 years for shooting an NYPD Emergency Service Unit cop three times in the chest during a clash at the Queensbridge Houses in Long Island City on April 18, 1997.
The cop, Police Officer Peter Bueti, was saved by his bullet-resistant vest.
The NYPD's Queens North gang squad was executing a search warrant of a fifth-floor apartment of the Queensbridge Houses on 12th St. near 41st Ave. about 6 a.m. on Nov. 7 when they found Huginnie and 29-year-old Tywaneeka Norville inside.
Cops say they recovered a .357-caliber magnum revolver, a .9-mm Glock and a .32-caliber revolver in the apartment along with cocaine and heroin.
While Huginnie lives in Brooklyn, he was staying in the Queensbridge Houses, sources said.
The Police Benevolent Association, the city's largest police union, said a much higher bail should have been set against Huginnie based on his criminal past and his apparent easy access to firearms.
"New Yorkers, this is your future, and the worst is still to come. The appalling and disturbing decisions that have now twice put a vicious cop-shooter back on our streets are not outliers - they are what our elected leaders have chosen," PBA President Patrick Lynch said in a statement Saturday, lashing out against bail reform advocates.
"Cops will continue to lock up perps like Huginnie whenever they get caught with guns, but it will make no difference," Lynch added. "Soon, they will be walking out the door before the ink on the arrest report is dry."
In 1997, Huginnie was arrested after a 90-minute standoff with police, according to a New York Times account of the incident. When cops showed up at his apartment, he fired off eight rounds at Bueti and other cops before barricading himself inside his apartment.
At the time of the shooting, he was being sought for a double stabbing that occurred in the Queensbridge Houses two months earlier.
He was convicted of attempted murder, assault, aggravated assault of a police officer and gun possession.

Podcasts on Cats, Impeachments And Mister Rogers

Texto completo: Our monthly roundup of interesting shows, and a look at the cottage industry of podcasts dedicated to the impeachment inquiry.
Impeachment news these days is not only dominating cable news headlines and newspaper front pages. It's also spawned a cottage industry of dedicated podcasts.
News outlets including CNN ("The Daily DC: Impeachment Watch"); NBC News ("Article II: Inside Impeachment"); Vox ("Impeachment, Explained"); The Washington Post ("Impeachment Inquiry"); BuzzFeed ("Impeachment Today"); WNYC ("Impeachment: A Daily Podcast"); and The New York Times ("The Latest," which debuts on Wednesday) have rushed to churn out explainer podcasts. Crooked Media, the liberal media company behind "Pod Save America," has one ("Rubicon"); so does the conservative "Never Trumper" John Zeigler ("Individual 1 Podcast"). Steve Bannon has made a radio show about it. And Rudy Giuliani is considering starting one, too.
So try one of those to help untangle the many threads of Washington's political hell circus. But if you're looking for counterprogramming to a news-filled subscription queue, here are a few other podcasts that came out this month that are decidedly impeachment-free.
'Finding Fred'
If you can't wait until the end of November for Tom Hanks's portrayal of Mister Rogers in "A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood," Fatherly, the dad-centric lifestyle brand, will fill that void. Each episode of this 10-part series peels back a layer of the seemingly simple, idyllic world of "Mister Rogers' Neighborhood." Fred Rogers, it turns out, was far more complicated than the cardigan-wearing puppeteer who quietly taught self-love and empathy for 31 seasons on his public television show. Yes, the podcast is a little heavy-handed positioning Rogers as the antithesis of President Trump. But the interviews with the people in Rogers's neighborhood like Officer François Clemmons will have you in tears by Episode 2.
'Book of Basketball 2.0'
In 2009, Bill Simmons was still a columnist at ESPN when he wrote his second book, "The Book of Basketball: The NBA According to the Sports Guy." In 2016, Simmons left the helm of ESPN's Grantland and launched his own sports and culture website: "The Ringer," which has spawned over 35 podcasts, most notably "The Bill Simmons Podcast," which consistently lands in the top 50 on the charts. His latest podcast focuses on the N.B.A., incorporating interviews with important players and revisiting top games and moments in the league. The first four episodes dropped at once, and Simmons has indeed updated since 2009 -- there's an awful lot on Steph Curry now, for instance. If you are not like me -- an alien who feeds only on audio content and cannot compute athletic culture -- and find sports discussion interesting, this in-depth basketball analysis is probably great.
'The Bilbcast'
When all the news podcasts clog up your feed and make you feel overwhelmed at the state of the world, why not listen to the musings of a contented cat? If the internet has taught us anything, it is that animal content is a balm within an otherwise hellish digital landscape. And why should that be limited to the visual mediums of cute GIFs, YouTube compilations or Instagram accounts? Enter Bilbo, a large orange cat with a contagious purr and rather large online following (73,000 Twitter followers and counting). His owner, Ellen Murray, records each episode by petting Bilbo on her lap and holding a mic toward the pleased sound her pet is making. There's not much narrative arc -- occasionally she will whisper encouragingly to him or adjust -- but you can't knock a concise concept: "A good boy purring to calm you down."
'The Shape of Care'
Finding or providing care -- whether for one's aging spouse, parents or family members --- has become an all-consuming struggle for many Americans. But the United States lacks the infrastructure to support that growing reality as 10,000 baby boomers turn 65 every day. The host, Mindy Fried, interviews caregivers, experts, activists and the families that turn to them to get help caring for the people they love. "The Shape of Care" illuminates the costs (financial and otherwise) of hiring that assistance, the toll on the caregivers and the need for a rethinking of a widening hole in the infrastructure of American health care.
'This is California: The Battle of 187'
The first season of "This Is California," from The Los Angeles Times and Futuro Studios, tells the story of the 1994 anti-immigrant ballot initiative that rocked the state and, it argues, set the stage for California becoming a "resistance" state and Trump becoming president. Gustavo Arellano, the host, layers his reporting with his own experiences as the son, friend and employee of American immigrants. His recounting of his experience of xenophobic high school bullying during the battle of Proposition 187 grounds this statewide story in the lived experience of the Americans labeled "illegal" and "undocumented."
'Smartr'
"Smartr" is either a parody or a dystopia set five minutes in the future, depending on your perspective. In this version of the United States, created by Conan O'Brien's Team Coco for the subscription-based Luminary, the revolution against start-up culture has come, and the insurgents have brought bombs. But the show's host, a self-proclaimed "victimized" venture capitalist, doesn't seem too concerned by the attempts on his life. Instead he's using his podcast as a sort of "Shark Tank" for wannabe tech founders, played by comedic guests like Tim Heidecker and Mamrie Hart. Each episode features a new pitch for an app that shockingly similar to the products coming out of Silicon Valley. (One start-up pitches Autonews, a computer-generated headline app that uses algorithms to construct what people want to see.) Insulated by their exorbitant wealth, the Silicon Valley protagonists seem just mildly perturbed that the proletariat is up in arms over invasions of privacy, manipulative algorithms and underpaying gig jobs. The result is a comic critique of a ruling tech class, and a warning of the inevitable revolt.

'Slow Burn Season 3'
After a chart-topping first two seasons about the road to impeachment for Presidents Nixon and Clinton, Slate's "Slow Burn" returns, not to the impeachment battle everyone else is talking about, but to a bicoastal 1990s rap battle. The new season's investigation into the lives and murders of Christopher Wallace, known as Notorious B.I.G., and Tupac Shakur delves into the broader cultural battles surrounding these larger-than-life performers: between hip-hop and law enforcement, and black civil rights leaders and rap. But its coverage of Tupac's sexual assault conviction in the first episode has opened the show to criticism it rarely received during its first two seasons.

Texto completo: BY MIKE SILVERMAN
The Associated Press
Soprano after soprano has knocked on the door of Rodolfo's garret through the years in Franco Zeffirelli's production of Puccini's "La Boheme" at the Metropolitan Opera. But none as often as Hei-Kyung Hong.
The Korean-born lyric soprano has portrayed the role of Mimi 66 times since her first outing in 1987. During that period, more than a dozen tenors have opened that door for her - including one or two she hadn't expected to see.
"Of course we rehearse, but sometimes somebody gets sick and you don't know Rodolfo until you enter. So it's, 'Oh, OK, you're my Rodolfo,'" Hong recalled in an interview at the Met last month.
"Those times are scary and wonderful," she added, "because you really feel like you're meeting somebody for the first time and you can use that moment. It's very impromptu."
Now, at age 60, Hong added to her total with an early November performance as the young seamstress who falls in love with the poet Rodolfo only to die of consumption in the final scene. Her sad story will again play out in the richly detailed Zeffirelli production, which premiered in 1981 and has become the most performed production of any opera in Met history.
How has her approach to the role changed through the decades?
"The more you live, you add a little more pepper and seasoning because you understand life," Hong said. "When you're starting out, you just sort of imagine. But as you grow older, you see people die from diseases, all this stuff happening."
Hong's husband of more than 20 years died of cancer in 2008.
Her interpretation might have deepened with age, but "your voice has to stay young," she said. "If your voice is old, it doesn't quite match."
The secret for keeping that youthful sound Hong traces back to the very beginning of her career. She had come to America to study at The Juilliard School at age 15 and remained there for nine years, during high school, college and postgraduate work.
"I would go to the New York City Opera and hear these phenomenal young singers, but within three years they would lose their voices," she said. "Too much singing, too much partying, too much pressure" - plus taking on roles that were too big for their voices.
Hong vowed not to go down that path, and after getting married at age 24, "I didn't have to sing to make money," she said. "My husband said I could quit whenever I wanted. I had that luxury that I didn't have to chase so desperately to succeed."
She mostly stayed close to home, living in Queens and raising three children while quietly building a reputation as one of the Met's most valuable assets. Since her debut in 1984 as Servilia in Mozart's "La Clemenza di Tito," she's performed nearly 400 times in a variety of roles. Other than Mimi, her most frequent portrayals have been as the slave girl Liu in Puccini's "Turandot" and as Micaela in Bizet's "Carmen," both of which she has sung nearly three dozen times.
And this season she took on a new role, Euridice in a revival of Gluck's "Orfeo ed Euridice." Critic Anthony Tommasini wrote in The New York Times that "though there were moments of patchy tone and shaky pitch in her singing, the radiance of her voice came through."
Through the years she's turned down many offers of roles she felt would be too heavy for her voice. "The day I realized I couldn't be Aida and Tosca, I had a moment of 'Awww ...'" she said. "But the soprano is a blessed category. I had to find what voice I had and make peace with that."
One role she especially regrets wasn't right for her is Puccini's "Madame Butterfly."
"Last year I said, 'I'll wait until I'm ready to retire and I have no fear of losing my voice and I'll just go and do it, I'll go blazing out,'" she said. "But no, I tried, it stressed me so much, I got sick."
Although Hong holds the mark for the most Mimis in the Zeffirelli production, she's far from the all-time Met leader. Frances Alda sang it 80 times from 1909-1929 and Lucrezia Bori sang it 72 times from 1912-1936.
Hong noted that she has no contracts after this season, but she has frequently been called in when another singer cancels and Met general manager Peter Gelb said: "We hope that these are not her final performances."
"If I don't sing anymore, I don't sing anymore," Hong said, adding a bit wistfully, "but wouldn't it be wonderful if I broke the record."

Texto completo: A few words about walls.
Unsurprisingly, the one Donald Trump is trying to build on the southern border — the one he swore Mexico would pay for — has proven, like most things he touches, an embarrassing failure. First came news early this month that smugglers have been able to cut through the barrier with a simple reciprocating saw, available at Home Depot for prices starting at less than $100. Then, TBS’ “Full Frontal with Samantha Bee” aired a segment demonstrating that the wall, which Trump has said “can’t be climbed,” can actually be climbed in as little as 15 seconds and by climbers as young as eight.
Maybe Mexico should demand a refund.
In the meantime, and with much less fanfare, construction continues on a wall of much further-reaching consequences. You see, while the wall on the border is supposed to repel immigrants and smugglers, this one repels something many of us find even more threatening: contradictory opinions. Consider three recent news stories:
* In Washington, the White House announces it will cancel government subscriptions to The Washington Post and New York Times. The administration calls it a cost-saving measure, but the truth is obvious. Trump famously hates both newspapers.
* In Citrus County, Florida, county commissioners reject the local library’s request for a digital subscription to The Times. Says Commissioner Scott Carnahan, “Fake news, OK, I agree with President Trump. I don’t want the New York Times in this county.”
* In Coeur d’Alene, Idaho, the library reports that an unknown patron has been hiding books critical of Trump and conservatism, deliberately mis-shelving them in other sections of the library. As that person explained in a note, “I am going to continue hiding these books in the most obscure places I can find to keep this propaganda out of the hands of young minds.”
The sheer snowflakery of all this cannot, of course, be overstated. And yes, it reeks of anti-intellectualism, that proud, bullyboy ignorance that has too often fed books — and bodies — into bonfires.
But this also speaks to barriers of intellectual — and emotional — separation that now zigzag across America like a scar, splitting towns, colleges, churches, workplaces, friendships and families. Nor is the barrier only being built from one side. As liberal college students demand "safe spaces" and "trigger warnings" so they won't have to confront contradiction of their beliefs, it becomes painfully clear this wall is a bipartisan project. And that should concern us all.
This is no argument for false equivalence, nor even for civility. But it is an argument for intellectual freedom — for honoring people's sacred right to speak and to hear.
The genius of America has always been that it believed in the marketplace of ideas, believed we should have access to the broadest possible range, and that if we did, we would, more often than not, choose the good over the bad, the right over the wrong, the intelligent over the stupid.
Yes, that trust has been sorely tested lately, but is the answer to abandon it completely? To do so would be to abandon everything that makes this country worth the trouble. To do so would be craven and un-American. As in commissioners of a podunk Florida county defending its citizens from The New York Times.
One doesn't know whether to laugh or cry. That wall Trump is trying to build against immigrants will go down as an expensive boondoggle. But you know what will cost us more in the long run?
Any wall we build against ourselves.

Haley's comet just fizzled

Texto completo: She had it all: A great personal story as a first-generation American, a likable personality, a solid political record, an uncommon ability to hit the ground running with ease and competence, and a golden opportunity that made her a household name and earned her an international reputation.
Then she wrote a book - and blew it.
Nikki Haley, former South Carolina governor - and more recently the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations - sandblasted her carefully crafted facade and, in a transparent act of virtue signaling, stabbed two of her former colleagues and fellow Cabinet members between the shoulder blades. Her return to the public stage can best be described as a goddess ex machina, whereby she descended from the upper realms to dispense wisdom and hurl thunderbolts into the hearts of any who would deny her.
No one did. Indeed, for the past several days, Haley and her just-released memoir, "With All Due Respect: Defending America With Grit and Grace," have been the talk of the town. News shows have homed in on a single allegation that seems to have been designed to produce TV teasers about "shocking revelations" - that Rex Tillerson, former secretary of state, and John Kelly, former White House chief of staff and a retired Marine Corps general, had tried to undermine President Trump and asked Haley to help.
More to the political point, Haley essentially launched her next act - possibly as Donald Trump's vice-presidential running mate (with all due respect to Mike Pence), or as a 2024 presidential candidate. Like clockwork, the president tweeted kudos and encouraged followers to buy the book.
Whatever her ultimate motive, Haley clearly decided that stepping on Tillerson and Kelly was in her political interest. There can have been no other reason to drag these two honorable, accomplished men through the mud for, by her own account, trying to mitigate some of Trump's more-destructive impulses.
Rather than sign on, Haley claims to have been offended by this conspiracy of good intentions. In her book and in several recent television appearances, her halo blindingly bright, Haley has said that Kelly and Tillerson thought they were aiming to "save the country" by attempting end runs around Trump.
They wouldn't have been the only ones, according to last year's anonymous op-ed in the New York Times in which the author similarly claimed that White House staffers and officials have been trying to save the country by working within, sometimes against the president's expressed wishes, which can change in a flash.
The resurfacing of these claims - and the anonymous author's new book - could help explain why good men and women continue to enter this decidedly dysfunctional White House. Being inside the White House may be a better position from which to manage the beast within.
It's a pickle. Do you ignore an immature president and take turns plugging the hole in the dike? (Hey, Haley we could use some help over here!) Or, do you do everything in your power to avoid actions that might cause the dike to crumble? One thing you don't do, obviously, is confide in an unscrupulous, self-serving, future presidential candidate.
Haley's loyalty to Trump at the expense of Tillerson and Kelly is both a hat-tip to Trump's base and a curtsy to the president. She plainly made a political calculation that people would find "her truth" courageous and that flattery aimed at Trump would not be wasted. "To undermine a president is really a very dangerous thing, and it goes against the Constitution and it goes against what the American people want," Haley intoned during a CBS News interview.
This would be true if said president weren't almost daily threatening to destroy order in the civilized world and didn't behave as though he were checking off the characteristics of narcissistic personality disorder. But there's an inherent irony in banking one's future on preaching loyalty through disloyalty. To what end does such a revelation, if true, warrant such tongue-wagging?
Alas, it seems that Haley, whom I've admired since before she became governor, bought her own myth and sold it cheap. Through her preening virtue, she has revealed herself to be more Lucy from "Peanuts" than Erin Brockovich - a cartoonish fussbudget stumping for blue ribbons and bows rather than a whistleblower acting in the service of the greater good.
Sad.

Texto completo: To win in business — and life — we all know that being a lifelong learner is mission critical. As the cheesy saying goes, "Learners are earners."
Clichés aside, I have a deep love for learning and the written word. Great books inspire, inform and give us the tools we need to win in these increasingly challenging times.
With so many books to choose from, it's easy to select a dud. I hate getting 75 pages into a book, only to realize it isn't worth finishing. To help you avoid information overload and snag a great read, I wanted to share my eight favorite books from 2019:
1. "Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones," by James Clear.
A fun read with a powerful approach to building daily habits in order to drive your achievement. The author shares inspiring stories while making the concept of chipping away at our biggest goals accessible. The book includes great tips and hacks on how to build good habits while removing bad ones.
2. "You Are Awesome: How to Navigate Change, Wrestle with Failure, and Life an Intentional Life," by Neil Pasricha.
Neil's book delivers a renewed spring in your step to anyone who has felt rejected, disappointed, or less-than-awesome in any way. The book is warm, touching, and personal. The author reveals some really cool techniques that I've embraced myself, including "untouchable days" and a 2-minute morning ritual that drives focus and gratitude.
3. "Everything Is Figureoutable," by Marie Forleo.
The wildly famous host of MarieTV breaks down her approach to achieving anything. It's a combination of motivation and practical tools. I found the book energizing as she reinforced important principles around resiliency and tenacity in a fun, fresh way.
4. "Can't Hurt Me: Master Your Mind and Defy the Odds," by David Goggins.
Not for the shy or timid, this memoir portrays life as the toughest person on earth. Goggins is a Navy Seal, Army Ranger, ultra-distance champion, and world-record holder for pull ups. This raw book reveals how he overcame a troubled past to build incredible mental toughness. If you want a kick-in-the-rear to push yourself harder, this is it.
5. "The Culture Code: The Secrets of Highly Successful Groups," by Daniel Coyle.
As someone who is fascinated with corporate culture, I was delighted to soak in the author's extensive research on what makes a high-performance culture. Great storytelling reveals many surprising truths and gives readers a blueprint to build effective teams.
6. "Finish: Give Yourself the Gift of Done," by Jon Acuff.
If you've ever started something but didn't finish it, this book is for you. Jon not only shares inspiring, memorable, and actionable stories, the book is loaded with laugh-out-loud humor. One of the most fun and productive books I've read in a long time.
7. "Blitzscaling: The Lightning Fast Path to Building Massively Valuable Companies," by Reid Hoffman.
A peek behind the curtain of Silicon Valley giants, the reader gets to see and feel what it's like to build a billion-dollar tech company. I enjoyed the ride, but also loved the practical takeaways for the rest of us mere mortals who are not trying to be the next tech titan.
8. "21 Lessons for the 21st Century," by Yuval Noah Harari.
A deeply thoughtful and provocative book, offering a glimpse of the future. Some books in this category showcase whiz-bang predictions, but here the author shares the impact that trends such as geo-political turmoil, artificial intelligence, and climate change will have on our kids and grandkids.
I highly recommend these books and hope you get the chance to devour them. Here's to your continued learning ... and success.

Ex-Mueller chief of staff says response to hacked DNC emails failed

Texto completo: The former chief of staff to special counsel Robert Mueller, speaking in Santa Fe on Friday, called the U.S. response to the Russian 2016 hack into Democratic National Committee emails a failure.
John Carlin said federal tactics in the wake of the breach -- which revealed emails as well as opposition research into then-candidate Donald Trump -- were not muscular enough. He said the federal government and journalists need to be "very public about what we see in terms of the threat measure" going into 2020.
Carlin spoke in the New Mexico House chamber at the Capitol during the Journalism Under Fire conference hosted by the Santa Fe Council on International Relations. He was part of a panel discussion with New York Times Washington, D.C., correspondent Matthew Rosenberg and BuzzFeed News East Africa correspondent Tamerra Griffin.
Carlin, the former assistant attorney general for the U.S. Department of Justice's National Security Division, said federal intelligence officials were concerned during the 2016 presidential election that revealing compromising information about a Russian hack into high-level Democrats' emails might deflate confidence in the electoral system.
But the decision to engage in diplomatic talks with Russia didn't work, Carlin said.
"I think it's clear that with hindsight, that was not effective," he said, adding that "Russia thinks of it as a success. By the time we posed consequences in the form of sanctions in December of 2016, even though it was the first time we've done that to the nation using this new executive order on sanctions, they were too little too late."
Carlin said foreign governments still pose a threat in terms of cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns going into the next presidential election. Foreign powers could, for example, disseminate reports about a phony natural disaster or lie about a polling site closure. "Then people don't go to vote," Carlin said.
Prior to the DNC hack, Sony Pictures Entertainment emails were hacked in 2014, which Carlin and other panelists also discussed.
The U.S. government has said North Korea was responsible, and charged computer programmer Park Jin Hyok with conspiring with the North Korean government to release employees' personal information and emails between top Sony executives.

OK, boomers, there's a new generation gap

Texto completo: Back in 1965, only a couple of years after the term "baby boomer" caught on as a label for the generation born in the wake of World War II, one 17-year-old high school newspaper columnist tried to explain his generation to his skeptical elders:
"Although we still have to face our responsibilities someday," he wrote, "our first impulse is to turn our backs and form a second society of our own. Someday we shall know for whom the bells toll but, for now, their sound is covered by the sounds of our hot rods and Beatles records."
That young journalist was me. I wrote that bold, manifesto-like essay, "New Breed of Teen Creates Second Society," in the March 2 edition of the biweekly newspaper at Middletown High School in Middle-town, Ohio. It even won an award from a high school journalism association for best feature story, which helped make up for my failure to make the school's basketball team.
More than a half-century later, I find myself rereading that piece to reacquaint myself with my high school version of me, now that my generation faces a new cultural assault from post-boomers.
I'm referring to the odd internet meme "OK, boomer," which has gone viral globally as Generations X, Y and Z's all-purpose retort to older people, bless our hearts, who just don't get it.
Appropriately, this craze reportedly began on TikTok, a web application still almost unknown to those of us who are still wondering why Snapchat is any better than Facebook. In one well-known clip on TikTok, a man of senior years grumbles, "The millennials and Generation Z have the Peter Pan syndrome, they don't ever want to grow up." That brought thousands of replies, most of which were "ok boomer," The New York Times reported.
The hashtag #okboomer went global. In New Zealand, Chlöe Swarbrick, a 25-year-old member of Parliament, went viral on video when she was heckled by an older member during a speech supporting a climate crisis bill. She casually responded with a terse, "OK, boomer," and resumed her speech without missing a beat.
A more recently viral variation satirized news that former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg was preparing a bid for the Democratic presidential nomination: "Ok, Bloomer."
But some attempts can be a tweet too far. Conservative Rochester radio host Bob Lonsberry, 60, tweeted this clunker of a protest tweet last weekend: "'Boomer' is the n-word of ageism. Being hip and flip does rot make bigotry ok, nor is a derisive epithet acceptable because it is new.'
Tsk, tsk. Thanks, Mr. Lonsberry for adding to my examples of how you don't have to be a liberal to act like a PC "snowflake."
On the other hand, my own millennial son, Grady Page, age 30, tells me he is "extremely critical of the idea that there's anything new about a millennial identity."
Today's "OK, boomer," delivered with suitable eye-rolling condescension, is only a "repetition of the generation gap" that I was writing about in the 1960s. "Only it's worse," he said, "because at least in the '60s you had some sort of a real social critique that went along with that," like the anti-war movement, the "war on poverty" and the civil rights movement.
"Now everybody's just seeking to identify with products and tastes for things like avocado toast," he said.
Hey, lay off the avocado toast. That's one of the Generation Z fads that I find to be pretty good.
More seriously, I thinkhe's shortchanging the explosion of activism that we have seen around issues like climate change, gun safety and police brutality in his own generation, which has more reasons than mine to care about them.
Nevertheless, we agreed that if the "OK, boomer" meme encourages the generations to talk to each other more, it can be a force for good.
When I wrote my high school newspaper report (did I mention that it won a prize?), I focused on how my generation's youngsters were trying to construct a "second society" all their own. Decades later, I realize that every generation tries to do that. It's not a different society as much as it is an attempt to improve the old one.
I finished that essay with a line from a hit by the British rockers the Animals: "I'm just a soul whose intentions are good / Oh, Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood."
I think we're still trying to do that. But now that we have fewer days ahead of us than we have behind us, we boomers have to face an unavoidable reality. We tried our best, but the future increasingly belongs to new generations. OK, boomers?

Texto completo: Leonard Skinner was a star basketball player, a ferocious competitor, a no-nonsense coach, a tough businessman. "Big Leonard," some called him. And he gained himself a good chunk of rock 'n' roll history when some Jacksonville longhairs named their rock band after him in mocking tribute.

Lynyrd Sknyrd.

Yet nothing could prevent his Alzheimer's disease as it worsened, and Leonard Skinner knew what was happening to him when he felt his mind and his memory slipping away.

"He used to call me his security blanket, when he knew he was getting sick and losing it," says his wife, Rosemary Skinner, a fellow Robert E. Lee High grad who married him in 1956.

It's a terrible thing, this disease, she says.

"It took a strong, strapping

old man and turned him into a dependent. That's the worst part: It just turned him into a, a sad -- I'm not sure what the adjective I'd use -- a shell."

On Saturday, she and her daughter, Susie Moore, will take part in the Jacksonville Alzheimer's Association Walk to End Alzheimer's. They're part of a team called 3 Steps for Leonard Skinner, and have already raised more then $3,000.

Rosemary, who uses a cane now at 83, will cover the distance on a scooter.

Leonard Skinner died in his sleep Sept. 20, 2010, shortly after eating a bowl of the ice cream he liked. He had been a resident of St. Catherine Laboure Manor, a nursing home in Riverside, for a year,

His was a death noted in newspapers, TV stations and websites around the world. Rosemary even talked with the BBC.

A crowd of about 250 overflowed a Westside chapel at the service for the Jacksonville native and Army veteran who, after coaching and teaching, went into a number of careers, including selling cars and real estate.

But it was an incident during his time teaching at Lee that made him what The New York Times called, upon his death, "arguably the most influential high school gym teacher in American popular culture."

The legend of Leonard Skinner started in the late 1960s, when he sent some students to the assistant principal's office because their hair was too long. One was Gary Rossington, then a young hotshot guitarist. Within years, the Jacksonville band he played in took the teacher's name as its own, eventually giving it a sardonic twist.

During a Times-Union interview in January 2009, Skinner said it always bothered him when stories grew to say he'd been particularly tough on them or that he'd even kicked them out of school.

"It was against the school rules. I don't particularly like long hair on men, but again, it wasn't my rule," he said.

Skinner soon forgot the incident. He didn't even recall the name of the long-haired student, and certainly didn't know of an up-and-coming Southern rock band named after him.

Skinner, who was more of a fan of elevator music, didn't like rock 'n' roll. In fact, when he came across his son playing Skynyrd's debut album, his response was, "What the hell kind of noise are you listening to?"

He never asked to become part of rock lore, but grew to enjoy it. He liked to pull out his wallet to show people that, yes, he really was Leonard Skinner. He made friends with some of the band when they jammed at The Still, a bar the ex-coach opened on San Juan Avenue, and Skinner also named a couple of bars at the Beaches after himself, capitalizing on his name.

He also allowed the band to use a photo of his Leonard Skinner Realty sign for the inside of their third album. Fans from around the world would call the actual number on the sign only to find out they were talking to the actual Leonard Skinner.

Their inevitable reaction, the ex-coach said? "Far out."

Lynyrd Skynyrd eventually even asked him to introduce the band at a concert in Jacksonville.

When reporters turned to him after the 1977 plane crash that killed six people on Skynyrd's plane, they found Skinner as stubborn as always. In an interview with the Times-Union, he complained at length about being misunderstood for his role in the band's history.

But he softened as he spoke of getting to know the band.

"They were good, talented, hard-working boys," he said. "They worked hard, lived hard and boozed hard."

His daughter said it was hard for her, as her father's condition worsened, to see his difficulty in following the sporting events that used to consume him. He even eventually lost the ability to follow the football games of his alma mater, Florida State University. "Oh my God," Susie Moore said. "That was his life."

Skinner rarely missed an FSU football game, and he was wearing garnet and gold when he was buried in Riverside Memorial Park Cemetery.

Rosemary Skinner says that as terrible as his condition became, there remained one great mercy to his family, even to the end.

"He never forgot any of us," she said. "He always called me by my name, and he always thanked me for visiting him."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump is asking the Supreme Court to block a subpoena for his tax returns, in a test of the president's ability to defy investigations.
The filing Thursday sets the stage for a high court showdown over the tax returns Trump has refused to release, unlike every other modern president. The justices also could weigh in more broadly on Trump's claim that sitting presidents can't be prosecuted or investigated for crimes.
The subpoena from the Manhattan district attorney is seeking Trump's tax returns back to 2011 from his accounting firm as part of a criminal investigation. Trump's lawyers say a criminal probe of the president at the state or local level is unconstitutional and unprecedented in American history.
Lower courts have rejected Trump's claims of immunity.
The Supreme Court justices may not decide whether to hear the case for at least another month.
A second, similar case is headed to the court over a House committee subpoena demanding Trump's financial records from the same accounting firm. The president has lost both cases at each step of the judicial system so far. The Mazars USA firm has said it will comply with the subpoenas, if courts agree.
Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. is seeking the records in a broader probe that includes payments made to buy the silence of two women, adult film actress Stormy Daniels and model Karen McDougal, who claim they had affairs with Trump before the 2016 election. Trump has denied the claims.
Brexit Party fails to clinch voting pact with Conservatives
LONDON - Britain's Brexit Party has failed to reach a tactical voting pact with the ruling Conservatives, saying Thursday that it will field 300 candidates in next month's election to force Prime Minister Boris Johnson to deliver on his promise of a clean break with the European Union.
Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage said the party had to contest the seats in Britain's Dec. 12 election to keep the pressure on Johnson, rebuffing Conservative arguments that doing so risks splitting the pro-Brexit vote and boosts parties that want to remain in the EU.
Britain is holding a national election on Dec. 12 because Johnson wants to secure a majority so he can take the U.K. out of the bloc.
Johnson reached a Brexit deal with the EU but has not persuaded enough British lawmakers to pass it.
Pastor: Jimmy Carter 'up and walking' post brain surgery
ATLANTA - Former President Jimmy Carter was already "up and walking" just a day after undergoing surgery to relieve pressure on his brain from bleeding linked to recent falls, his pastor said.
The Rev. Tony Lowden visited Carter, 95, in an Atlanta hospital on Wednesday.
"His spirits are good and he is up and walking," Lowden told reporters.
Carter Center spokeswoman Deanna Congileo has said there were no complications during Carter's Tuesday surgery at Emory University Hospital for a subdural hematoma, blood trapped on the brain's surface.
The center said the bleeding was connected to Carter's recent falls. A Spring fall required Carter to get hip replacement surgery. He fell twice in October, hitting his head at least once.
Trump Jr.'s book is a No. 1 bestseller, but with an edge
NEW YORK - Donald Trump Jr.'s "Triggered" is a No. 1 New York Times bestseller, although not without an edge.
"Triggered: How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us" came out last week and tops the hardcover nonfiction list that will appear in the Times on Nov. 24.
A dagger symbol appears next to the listing, indicating that some of the sales were "bulk purchases," often meaning that the author or someone associated with the author bought a substantial number of copies. A spokesman for the Republican National Committee, Steve Guest, said the RNC has been offering "Triggered" as a fundraising incentive, a common practice for political books.
Guest said copies were bought "to keep up with demand," not in a "large bulk purchase."
North Korea: US offers to restart nuclear talks
SEOUL, South Korea - North Korea on Thursday said the United States has proposed a resumption of stalled nuclear negotiations in December as they approach an end-of-year deadline set by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for the Trump administration to offer an acceptable deal to salvage the talks.
In a statement released by state media, North Korean negotiator Kim Myong Gil didn't clearly say whether the North would accept the supposed U.S. offer.
He said North Korea has no interest in talks aimed at buying time without discussing solutions. He said the North isn't willing to make a deal over "matters of secondary importance," such as possible U.S. offers to formally declare an end to the 1950-53 Korean War, which was halted by a cease-fire, not a peace treaty, or establish a liaison office between the nations.
US implores EU nations to retake fighters from IS group
WASHINGTON - European and other members of the international coalition fighting the Islamic State group must take back and prosecute their nationals detained in Iraq and Syria to help keep IS from regaining territory, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Thursday.
Pompeo told foreign ministers and senior officials from about 30 coalition members that it's imperative that they hold thousands of detained foreign fighters accountable for atrocities committed while IS held swathes of territory in the two countries.
Many of the detained foreign fighters are from Europe, but countries have been reluctant to take them back and officials acknowledged there are still differences of opinion among coalition partners about how best to deal with them.
In South Carolina: A school shooter who was 14 when he killed a first grader on a school playground in South Carolina after killing his father in their home was sentenced Thursday to life in prison without parole.
Jesse Osborne, now 17, crashed his father's pickup truck into the fence on Sept. 28, 2016 and fired on first graders at Townville Elementary School celebrating a classmate's birthday.
But Osborne's lawyers noted he never tried to get inside the school, even though police took 12 minutes to arrive.
Osborne, who was tried as an adult, had left a video chat open on his cellphone and witnesses said he was pacing outside, crying and saying he was sorry. Jacob Hill, 6, was killed.

Local medical facilities treated super fungus cases

Texto completo: State regulators have released the list of medical facilities in New York that treated the deadly drug-resistant fungus identified by U.S. health officials as a serious global health threat, including one in Dutchess County.
The disclosure comes after at least 587 cases of Candida auris infections have been confirmed in a dozen states over the last few years. Most of them were in the New York City area, as well as New Jersey and Chicago, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported.
The fungus – also referred to as C. auris – is resistant to some or all antifungal medicines, which makes it harder to treat, the CDC says.
It can quickly lead to death in patients who have weakened immune systems or other underlying serious medical problems.
More than one in three patients with an invasive infection of the fungus has died, the CDC said.
The list of medical facilities that treated C. auris in New York consists of 64 hospitals, 103 long-term care facilities, three hospices and one long-term acute care hospital statewide. It was included in the 2018 Hospital Acquired Infections report, as first reported by The New York Times.
Health officials in New York noted in the 2018 report that a broad range of factors are involved in treating and tracking the spread of the fungus.
For example, the patients tend to have multiple serious medical problems with frequent admissions and transfers between medical facilities, which in part makes it difficult to determine where they acquired the infection.
Health officials asserted the list of facilities that treated the fungus should not be used by consumers to decide where to seek care.
Inclusion on the lists does not relate to quality of care, they stated in the report.
The list spans between Jan, 1, 2016, and June 28, 2019, and included facilities known to have cared for a person infected, colonized, or possibly colonized with C. auris.
Previously, state and federal agencies have withheld the names of medical facilities that have been affected by the deadly fungus.
Releasing the details on Candida auris New York state health officials said they released the list to provide transparency to consumers and encourage hospitals and nursing homes to help stop its spread, according to the Times.
Darren Dopp, senior vice president of the Healthcare Association of New York State, in an email addressed state health officials' decision to include the list in the 2018 infections report.
"Everyone in the healthcare community is working hard to confront the problem," Dopp wrote.
"Through collaborative efforts and implementation of best practices, we're making progress, but as the report indicates, candida auris and other drug-resistant pathogens are a serious concern," he added.
The health care trade group noted New York is a major travel hub and, as such, its medical facilities are often the first to identify and respond to emerging infections like C. auris.
It asserted New York medical facilities have unmatched expertise in addressing the most complicated public health challenges, citing recent CDC and Health Department reports that show decreasing rates of infection in key areas.
The medical facilities on the 'superbug' list In addition to New York City and Long Island, several of the hospitals and nursing homes on the list were in Rockland and Westchester counties. Monroe, Dutchess and Orange counties each had one hospital on the list.
Hospitals:
In Poughkeepsie, Vassar Brothers Medical Center.
In Middletown, Orange Regional Medical Center.
In Westchester, St. John's Riverside Hospital in Yonkers and Westchester Medical Center in Valhalla.
In Rockland, Good Samaritan Hospital of Suffern, Helen Hayes Hospital in West Haverstraw and Montefiore Nyack Hospital.
Long-term care facilities:
In Westchester, Adira at Riverside Rehabilitation and Nursing in Yonkers, Schaffer Extended Care Center in New Rochelle, and Tarrytown Hall Care Center.
In Rockland, Friedwald Center for Rehabilitation and Nursing in New City; Northern Manor Geriatric Center in Nanuet; Northern Riverview Health Care Center in Haverstraw; Nyack Ridge Rehab & Nursing Center in Valley Cottage; and Pine Valley Center for Rehabilitation and Nursing in Spring Valley.
Candida auris is a deadly fungus that has popped up in New Jersey and the New York City area.

Biden's revisionist nonsense

Texto completo: Former Vice President Joe Biden said recently he agrees with Jim Mattis that the Obama administration's decision to withdraw troops from Iraq was a mistake, but that as vice president he tried to keep "a residual force" there. This is revisionist nonsense. At the July Democratic presidential debate, Biden boasted that "one of the proudest moments of my life was to stand there in Al-Faw Palace and tell everyone that ... all our combat troops are coming home." In September, he declared, "We were right to get the combat troops out." But now he agrees it was a mistake?
The fact is, at the time Biden expressed zero regrets about the U.S. withdrawal, which he was in charge of executing. The New York Times reports that in December 2011 Biden was "ebullient" as he presided over the departure ceremony for the last American forces, calling President Barack Obama from Baghdad to tell him, "All I've said about this job, I take it back. Thank you for giving me the chance to end this goddamn war."
Of course, he he unleashed a humanitarian and national security catastrophe. Biden's withdrawal created a vacuum that allowed the Islamic State  to regroup, reconstitute itself and build a murderous caliphate. The terrorists enslaved and raped thousands of Yazidi girls and carried out gruesome executions across Iraq and Syria. And they spread their murderous tentacles across the globe, carrying out 143 attacks in 29 countries that killed more than 2,000 people and injured many thousands more.
Biden has criticized President Donald Trump for withdrawing from Syria against the advice of our military commanders. Yet Biden did not listen to our military commanders when it came to the Iraq withdrawal. The Times reports that Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, the U.S. commander in Iraq, proposed keeping as many as 24,000 troops in Iraq. According to Biden national security adviser Colin H. Kahl, Austin was told by the White House "you've got to be kidding." So Austin presented Obama and Biden with options for 19,000, 16,000 and 10,000 troops - and told them the lowest number was "unwise." But Biden "aggressively pushed for a smaller force," and Obama agreed. Then, during negotiations with the Iraqis, the administration cut the offer in half to just 5,000 - an offer the Iraqis rejected.
In his interview with The Wall Street Journal, Biden blamed George W. Bush for the U.S. withdrawal, noting that he had negotiated a status of forces agreement that required an end to the U.S. military presence by 2011. Does anyone believe that if Bush were still in office in 2011, he would have pulled out all U.S. forces? Of course not.
The reason Obama and Biden were unable to get an agreement to extend the U.S. troop presence is because they made it clear to the Iraqis that America was headed for the exits. Iraqis watched as Obama and Biden rejected numbers well above 10,000, only grudgingly agreed to even that number and then cut that number to 5,000. If you were an Iraqi, would this have given you confidence in America's long-term commitment?
Iran and its political allies inside Iraq were pressing for a U.S. withdrawal, and threatening politicians who supported extending the American military presence. For Iraqi leaders, 24,000 American troops might have been worth the political risk, and maybe even 10,000 would have been worth it. But an offer of just 5,000 troops from an administration that was determined to go to zero as quickly as possible was not. If America was leaving, and Iran was staying, why risk siding with the Americans?
Biden supported the Iraq invasion but then opposed the Bush surge, which crushed the Islamic State and won the war. Then he supported a premature withdrawal that allowed the terrorists to regroup and was celebrating that decision as recently as four months ago - but now says he regrets it. That's quite a record for a man running on his record of experience and judgment.

Texto completo: Free college, a fringe idea not long ago, has gone mainstream in the Democratic primary campaign.
Candidates Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are notably running on zeroing out tuition and fees. According to a July poll by the New York Times, about three out of five Americans support guaranteed free tuition to two- and four-year colleges. More than 20 states and a host of cities have trimmed or eliminated tuition charges at community colleges. New York state has gone further, making a no-tuition commitment to bachelor's degree candidates whose family or personal income is less than $125,000 a year.
Eliminating tuition sounds like a utopian good, but it misses the mark. It ignores the biggest reason students aren't earning college degrees -- an appallingly high dropout rate -- and it may make the situation worse.

Freshmen are generally confident that they will earn a bachelor's degree in four years, but only about 40% actually do. Even after six years, just 60% have graduated. Community colleges have an even worse record -- about one in three earn an associate degree in three years. A high school with such a woeful record would be labeled a dropout factory.
The effect on students who leave school before graduating is profound. They are three times as likely to default on college loans and more likely to be unemployed than college grads. Over their lifetimes, they will earn as much as $1 million less.
It's tempting to think that dropping out is merely a money issue and that zero tuition will solve the problem. Mitt Romney thought so; when he was governor of Massachusetts, he launched the merit-based Adams Scholarships, which offer eight tuition-free semesters at Massachusetts public colleges and universities to students who score high on a statewide achievement test.
But as Brandeis University economist Joshua Goodman, coauthor with Sarah Cohodes of a study of the Adams Scholarships, explains, the winning students don't save much money. Tuition is relatively cheap in Massachusetts -- less than $1,000 at community colleges and regional public universities. The dollar crunch comes from the fees charged for such things as enrolling in classes to participating in graduation ceremonies. Those bills can be a shocker -- at the state university in Bridgewater, Mass., for instance, tuition is $910 a year but fees come to nearly $10,000.
The most comprehensive of the Democratic candidates' plans would tackle fees and tuition at public institutions, but there remains a stubborn problem. Dangling free education in front of students prompts them to choose state colleges that are often less competitive and have lower graduation rates than schools they might otherwise have attended. Even a scholarship winner can get dragged down by the forces that contribute to those lower rates. The Adams Scholarship researchers looked at students with similar test scores and compared those who took free tuition and went to state schools with those who didn't and went to more competitive schools. The Adams recipients were 40% less likely to graduate on time.
As for community college, research shows that free tuition alone at two-year schools draws students away from four-year institutions. Because the graduation rate at community colleges is much lower than at four-year schools, these students are less likely to earn bachelor's degrees. If they manage an associate diploma, they'll earn about 30% less than those who graduate with a bachelor's degree.
In short, quality matters, and many dollar-starved state schools can only afford to batch-process students. They can't provide the small classes, wide array of courses and accessible advisors that contribute to high graduation rates. Free-college proposals don't include plans to replace the money that these schools, which rely heavily on tuition, would lose if zero tuition comes to pass. What's more, economists project that in a free-college world, university enrollment would increase by as much as 22%, stretching bare-bones budgets even further.
All of this suggests a different approach to improving graduation rates. States need to exercise political leadership to restore, and then increase, the estimated $9 billion that lawmakers slashed from their higher education budgets during the last decade. In a nationwide study, economists Daniel Lovenheim, Rajashri Chakrabarti and Nicole Gorton showed the outsized impact of more funding. They compared students who were enrolled in state colleges when a budget increase kicked in and those who attended the same schools before the increased funding. By their 30s, students who had the benefit of more state support had higher credit scores and lower credit card debt than the comparison group; they were also more likely to own homes and cars, and more likely to have enrolled in graduate school.
The study didn't detail what the additional money paid for, but other research has shown that common sense investments make a difference -- hiring more instructors, adding advisors who can deliver the "we have your back" assistance that students need, and offering more sections of classes required for students to finish their majors. Instead of stalling out for want of a few credits, the added class sections allow students to efficiently get their degrees and move on.
"Free college" will surely increase enrollment in four- and two-year schools, but if it doesn't get students across the finish line it won't shrink the opportunity gap. Middle-class and low-income students need financial aid, but that's different from guaranteeing a free ride for all. The goal is not to lure high-schoolers into college with zero tuition, it's to assure that those who do enroll graduate.

Ariz. delegation's impeachment views

Texto completo: As the House impeachment inquiry moved to public hearings about President Donald Trump's dealings with Ukraine, Arizona's congressional delegation has largely made clear where they stand on issue.
Here's what the state's nine House members and two senators have said:
House Democrats Rep. Tom O'Halleran: The former Chicago police detective and political moderate has struck a measured tone that isn't surprising for a Democrat holding a district Trump carried in 2016.
He was the only Arizona House Democrat who didn't already support an impeachment inquiry after the special counsel's report on Russian interference in the 2016 election.
"It is critical that we review any evidence related to alleged abuse of power and allow all parties involved to do the same," O'Halleran said after voting to approve the inquiry's process and rules. "I have always been an advocate for expanding transparency in all levels of our government."
Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick: In her fourth term, but first in the more-progressive Tucson-based district she now represents, the former prosecutor has made it clear she wants to hold the president accountable.
"Impeachment is the top issue that I hear. ... There's a lot of public support for it," she said in a recent interview with the Tucson-based Arizona Daily Star. "I was slow coming to the impeachment table. We've only done that four times in history. It's a big move to remove an elected president. But I started reading the Mueller report, and I got about 80 pages into it, and I said if I had gotten a report like this as a prosecutor, we would have already issued 15 different charges."
Rep. Greg Stanton: He's a freshman in Congress and a member of the House Judiciary Committee that could be tasked with drafting articles of impeachment. Unlike O'Halleran's hedging, Stanton has already spoken of Trump's behavior unfavorably.
"The House has collected extensive evidence about the president's misconduct, and now the American people will be able to hear directly from witnesses in an open setting," he said after the inquiry process vote.
Rep. Ruben Gallego: A vocal critic of Trump, Gallego hasn't been shy about hitting the president over his Ukraine dealings.
"We have to fight Trump on all fronts," he said in an interview with CNN. "Let's be clear: The president impeached himself. He released the memo that basically points to the extortion of the Ukrainian government, so I don't think we have to overthink this. I think we'll continue pushing forward with actually exposing more of these allegations, more of these issues. But this is already a done deal."
Rep. Raúl Grijalva: The dean of Arizona's delegation skipped Trump's inauguration and supported an impeachment inquiry two years ago. He views the administration as dangerous, corrupt and backs dramatic action.
"The witness testimony couldn't be clearer: Trump sacrificed our national security interests and abused the office of the Presidency to investigate a political rival," Grijalva said in a tweet after transcripts of the Democratic witnesses already interviewed were released. "Congress has no choice but to stand up to this abuse and" defend our democracy.
House Republicans Rep. David Schweikert: He holds a House seat Democrats think they can compete in next year and is fending off an ethics investigation as well. He has said little about Trump's behavior generally and of the Ukraine allegations specifically.
Even so, he joined other House Republicans condemning the process Democrats used to reach the inquiry.
"This resolution is not a serious vote for authorizing a fair and open impeachment inquiry and does not make any changes to the partisan and secretive process House Democrats created 37 days ago, but have been pushing for months," he said. "We should not support the current investigative process, which leaves my constituents in the dark on the investigations being conducted behind closed doors."
Rep. Debbie Lesko: She is on the Judiciary Committee and was among the House Republicans who stormed one of the closed-door witness interviews in an effort to spotlight a process she thinks is geared only toward ousting Trump.
"What are we doing here? The Judiciary Committee in its 206-year history has never reported articles of impeachment against a president without first conducting an impeachment inquiry authorized by the full House vote," she said during a hearing. "This resolution is yet another example of the majority utilizing this taxpayer-funded committee to influence the 2020 presidential election. That's all it is. It's a show."
Rep. Andy Biggs: In his second term, Biggs heads the House Freedom Caucus, which is perhaps Trump's most ardent core of support on Capitol Hill. Biggs, Arizona's third member of the Judiciary Committee, has attacked the process and the motives of those involved in the inquiry.
"It's not a fair process. It's not due process. It's (House Intelligence Committee Chairman) Adam Schiff's process and (House Speaker) Nancy Pelosi's process," he said on Fox News. "If you do it that way, they are in a dangerous situation by opening this thing up because the whole world will Adam Schiff try to control everything, and that's not good for the Democrats."
Rep. Paul Gosar: He represents Arizona's most Republican-dominated district and is among Trump's most ardent defenders in Washington. He routinely excoriated Democrats for their efforts probing Russian interference, and has flatly said he will not impeach the president.
"I am not voting for impeachment. Time and time they have investigated this, with nothing there," he told the Verde Independent.
Arizona's senators Sen. Kyrsten Sinema: In the first year of her six-year term, the Democratic senator has cited the "serious allegations" against Trump and has urged all senators to not prejudge the evidence in the event proceedings move to a trial phase in the upper chamber.
"Arizonans deserve a government that upholds our Constitutional values," Sinema, an attorney, said in a September written statement. "Partisan politics have no place in addressing these serious allegations. This process may require the Senate to fulfill a Constitutional role, so it is the duty of all senators — including myself — to avoid pre-judging facts or reaching conclusions."
Sinema was listed along with Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., in a recent New York Times story as a Democrat who may not vote to convict Trump.
Sen. Martha McSally: The freshman Republican who was appointed to the seat once held by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., after losing her 2018 Senate run, has the most to lose by the prospects of impeachment. She must stand before Arizona voters again in 2020.
Shortly after the House launched proceedings, McSally did not address Trump's alleged conduct. She instead focused on the potential political consequences of impeachment and called the process "a total distraction" that is not at the top of voter's minds: "People can make their voices heard at the ballot box, right," she said then.
McSally has signed onto a resolution sponsored by South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham that condemns the impeachment inquiry.
During a Nov. 6 telephone town hall, McSally did not directly answer two separate questions from constituents questions pertaining to Trump's requests for foreign political assistance. Instead, she lambasted what she described as "selective leaks" and the "liberal media."

Texto completo: In fall 2018, Elton John kicked off his "Farewell Yellow Brick Road" tour at Allentown's PPL Center.
The tour is deemed John's last ever, and now Central Pennsylvania fans will get one last chance to see the celebrated star.
John will perform at Hershey's Giant Center on April 20, 2020. Tickets go on sale Friday, Nov. 22, at 10 a.m. For the first day on sale, tickets will be available exclusively at ticketmaster.com.
The Hershey date is one of 24 new concerts added to the previously sold-out tour. The newly announced dates complete John's second year of the three-year tour.
Rolling Stone called John's latest production "the most bombastic, elaborate, high-tech arena show he's ever attempted."
John last performed in Hershey in September 2016. Read LNP's review of that performance here.
While John is wrapping up his time as a touring artist, his place in the zeitgeist has perhaps never been more prominent. The major motion picture "Rocketman," a biography of John, came out in May. And just last month, he released the memoir "Me," which was No. 1 on the New York Times Best Sellers list.

Frank Bruni: Trump’s contempt for true professionals

Texto completo: The impeachment inquiry and the events that led to it tell many stories. One, obviously, is about the abuse of power. Another illuminates the foul mash of mendacity and paranoia at the core of Donald Trump.
But this week, as several longtime civil servants testify at the inquiry’s first public hearings, a third narrative demands notice because it explains the entire tragedy of the Trump administration: the larger scandals, the lesser disgraces and the current moment of reckoning.
That story is the collision of a president who has absolutely no regard for professionalism and those who try to embody it, the battle between an arrogant, unscrupulous yahoo and his humble, principled opposites.
Right now the opposites have the microphone.
I mean William Taylor, America’s top diplomat in Ukraine, who is, tellingly, the first impeachment witness to testify on live television. Stephanie Grisham, the White House’s peerlessly nasty press secretary, has sought to discredit Taylor’s account of the pressure on Ukraine’s new president by saying that he belonged to a cabal of “radical unelected bureaucrats.”
Hardly. He’s a West Point graduate and Vietnam veteran with a half-century career that’s devoid of obvious partisanship and entirely about the public good. He took the Ukraine post despite profound qualms because he felt he owed his country his expertise. He’s a creature of duty and discipline and earnestly accrued knowledge — all precious commodities that are worthless in Trump’s eyes. In other words, he’s a true professional, and it was as such that he recoiled from what Trump, Rudy Giuliani and the wretched rest of them were up to.
Marie Yovanovitch, the former ambassador to Ukraine, has a diplomatic résumé that’s three decades long and includes three ambassadorships, an unusual feat. The fault that Giuliani and Trump found in her was her respect for correct procedure, her resistance to corrupt politics and her reluctance to tweet out dopey praise for the president. They quibbled with her professionalism, which had no place in their schemes.
Trump’s disregard — no, contempt — for professionalism is in some ways an anagram of his aversion to norms, to tradition, to simple courtesy. Or at least these attitudes exist as a Venn diagram with enormous overlap. They’re hostile to any set of values that places personal glory below other ideals.
But Trump’s war on professionalism and professionals is also its own distinct theme in his business career, which is rife with cheating, and his political life, which is greased with lies.
Go back to his initial staffing of senior posts and recall how shoddy the vetting process was. Also notice two prominent classes of recruits: people who had profoundly questionable preparation for the jobs that he nonetheless gave them (Ben Carson, Betsy DeVos, Stephen Miller, Javanka) and genuine professionals who wagered that their skills would be critically necessary — and thus highly valued — and that Trump would surely rise to the established codes and expected conduct of his office.
Now look at how many of those professionals (James Mattis, H.R. McMaster, Gary Cohn, Dan Coats) are gone. And tell me whether Trump has ever had the epiphany that the presidency is, in fact, a profession.
A crisis of professionalism defines his administration, in which backstabbing is the new glad-handing, firings are cruel, exits are ugly, the turnover is jaw-dropping, the number of unfilled positions is mind-boggling, and many officials have titles that are prefaced with “acting” — a modifier with multiple meanings in this case.
Trump slyly markets his anti-professionalism as anti-elitism and a rejection of staid, cautious thinking. But it’s really his way of excusing his ignorance, costuming his incompetence and greenlighting his hooliganism.
He rejects professionalism because it tempers self-promotion and forbids such grandiose claims as his insistence that he knows more about the Islamic State than any military general. “I alone can fix it,” he boasted at the Republican convention in 2016. “I’m the only one that matters,” he said the following year when dismissing any concerns about job vacancies. A true professional would have trouble uttering those words. They roll easily off a true huckster’s tongue.
Professionalism involves credentials, benchmarks, all sorts of yardsticks by which a person can be judged, sometimes unkindly. Trump wants only affirmation. And professionalism is a reality-based enterprise. Trump prefers fiction: The Ukraine call was “perfect.” “Read the transcript” because it exonerates him. His critics are partisan hacks. He’s the target of an interminable “witch hunt.”
But Robert Mueller was no more hunting witches than Bill Taylor is an agent of the deep state. In fact Mueller stands out as a consummate professional, so much so that he politically neutered himself, and “deep state” is Trump’s deeply cynical pejorative for “seasoned professionals.”
It’s the professionals who keep pushing back at him, whether at the Federal Reserve; the Birmingham, Alabama, office of the National Weather Service; or the State Department, which is where Taylor, Yovanovitch and this week’s other impeachment witness, George Kent, worked.
Michael McFaul, a former U.S. ambassador to Russia, wrote about Taylor and Yovanovitch recently in an essay for The New York Review of Books titled “The Deeply Dedicated State,” observing: “Both always have struck me as first-rate government servants, singularly focused on advancing American national interests. Both have served Republican and Democratic presidents, and even after decades of interacting with them both, I could not guess how either of them votes.”
He characterized them as “accidental heroes” who aren’t “likely to seek the limelight.” “They are extremely well trained, competent, and highly regarded professionals,” he summarized.
That’s why they bucked Trump. And that’s why he can’t bear them.

Did ABC and CBS Collude to Punish the Wrong Employee? Being suspected of whistleblowing may be enough to get fired by broadcast networks.

Texto completo: On Thursday this column noted that while news organizations ABC and CBS publicly revere the holy sanctity of anonymity for the federal "whistleblower," they collaborated to identify and fire their own suspected whistleblower. But they seem to have axed the wrong employee. And now a new report suggests that ABC is back on the hunt for its internal dissenter.
Last week the media giants appeared to have unmasked a CBS employee who—during a previous stint at ABC—leaked a recording of ABC's Amy Robach. On the recording, recently published by Project Veritas, Ms. Robach discusses her unsuccessful effort years ago to persuade the network to air a story on pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.
It was bizarre enough to see two networks lionizing the anti-Trump whistleblower on air while colluding off camera on their own whistleblower reprisal. But the recipient of this punishment says she never leaked anything. Interviewed by journalist Megyn Kelly, a woman named Ashley Bianco says that she was indeed fired by CBS but had never shared the ABC recording with anyone.
Now Emily Smith writes in the New York Post that ABC executives are still hunting for "the identity of the leaker behind the Amy Robach tape" and adds:
After junior producer Ashley Bianco denied leaking the tape, on which the anchor complained that ABC News killed her interview with Jeffrey Epstein victim Virginia Roberts Giuffre, someone purporting to be the actual leaker and still working at the network posted a letter on Project Veritas blasting ABC's "mission of seek and destroy" to conjure up the mysterious mole.
Project Veritas editors confirmed the missive was penned by the same ABC News insider who gave them the tape "in light of the actions taken against those wrongfully identified as involved in the leaking."
ABC and CBS are free to set their own workplace rules and to refuse to permit unidentified employees to leak internal discussions. But can they at least stop pretending that the President's accuser has a sacred right to remain anonymous?

Another Potential Murder Committed by the 'Scholar'
While the Washington Post is still claiming that terrorist Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was a "scholar," there's new evidence that the fiend was even more murderous than previously reported. It seems that along with raping and torturing an American hostage, he also may have ordered her execution. Adam Goldman and Rukmini Callimachi report in the New York Times:
After the Islamic State declared that Kayla Mueller, a 26-year-old humanitarian worker from Arizona it was holding hostage, was killed in an airstrike in Syria in 2015, her parents became increasingly frustrated with the government's slow hunt for answers about her death and turned to a former F.B.I. agent for help.
Now, he has unearthed a clue: Ms. Mueller may have been executed on the orders of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the slain Islamic State leader, not in a Jordanian airstrike as the Islamic State long claimed.
ISIS operatives killed Ms. Mueller because she knew the identities of Mr. al-Baghdadi and of Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, the group's spokesman at the time who was believed to be the second-in-command, and could be a security risk for them, according to Umm Sayyaf, the wife of a close al-Baghdadi associate. She was interviewed by the former F.B.I. agent working with the Mueller family, Ali Soufan.

Trump in Manhattan
President Donald Trump's Tuesday speech to the Economic Club of New York left investors wanting more news of trade comity. But New Yorkers are still savoring Mr. Trump's Monday remarks honoring America's military heroes. Here's an excerpt from the President's Veterans Day speech at Madison Square Park:
... Also here with us today is Lauren Mathews, the granddaughter of a Battle of the Bulge veteran who has since passed away. His name was Master Sergeant Roddie Edmonds. Like so many of our veterans, Roddie never talked about the war. Lauren never knew her grandfather's story until she embarked upon a school project about 10 years ago.
Roddie was in the 422nd regiment, which was overwhelmed when the Nazis launched their surprise assault. He and his men fought for three treacherous days before being taken as prisoners of war.
After they arrived at a prison camp, the German commander sent an order over the loud speaker. The Jewish-American soldiers were all told to step out of line during the roll call the next day. Knowing the terrible fate that would come to his Jewish comrades, Roddie immediately said, "We're not doing that." He sent orders to have every American step out of line with their Jewish brothers-in-arms.
The next morning, 1,292 Americans stepped forward. The German commander stormed over to Roddie and said, "They cannot all be Jews." Roddie stared right back; he said, "We are all Jews here."
At that point, the German put a gun to Roddie's head and demanded, "You will order the Jews to step forward immediately or I will shoot you right now through the head." Roddie responded, "Major, you can shoot me, but you'll have to kill us all." ... The German turned red, got very angry, but put down his gun, and walked away.
... One of the 200 Jewish-American soldiers who was saved that fateful day is Staff Sergeant Lester Tanner. Lester is now 96 years old and he joins us here...Thank you... for your very noble service and for sharing this incredible story with the world.

'One of the First Farms that I Heard Beautiful Stories About'
Meanwhile on the left coast, there's a less uplifting story related to the history of World War II. Erica Hellerstein recently reported in the San Jose Mercury News:
Each morning, just after the sun lights up the shores of Half Moon Bay, Rosa Manrriquez steps out her door, walks past the neatly manicured flowers lining her walkway, and drives to the Bay City Flower Company, a place she has called a second home since 1979, when she began working there.
But on this October morning, the trip to work is one of her last. On November 10, the family-owned flower operation will close its doors for good, marking the end of an era for a company, started 110 years ago by a Japanese immigrant, that survived the Great Depression and the family's internment during World War 2, and grew into one of the largest employers in Half Moon Bay...
[Bay City Flower President Harrison Higaki] said the decision to close was based on a number of factors, but pointed to the cost of labor as the main driver. The minimum wage in California for employers with at least 26 employees is $12 per hour and is slated to rise to $15 for all employers by 2022.
"Labor is our single highest expense category," he said. "The writing was on the wall."

'Hard Men Solving Tough Problems'
A more entertaining tale arrives from the indispensable Kyle Smith today :
There used to be a lot of overlap between what we think of as a Hollywood studio picture (designed to earn money) and an awards movie (designed to fill the trophy case, usually with an accompanying loss of money). Ford v Ferrari is a glorious throwback to the era when big stars did quality movies about actual people with real-life problems, but the scripts nevertheless adhered to basic Hollywood formulae such as "Have an exciting climax." Today, the "awards-season" pictures tend to be allergic to entertainment, and they often trickle out rather than conclude. They seem more interested in making us feel guilty than inspiring us. Ford v Ferrari, though, is delightful old-school entertainment.
...The unspoken assumption behind the film is that if there is any category on earth in which America is not winning, we probably just aren't trying hard enough. Sounds about right to me. Plus, as in Talladega Nights, it's always fun to teach those espresso-drinking Eurosnobs not to underestimate American resolve.

Trump's suit against N.Y. over taxes rejected

Texto completo: A federal judge on Monday dismissed President Trump's lawsuit against New York officials that was aimed at preventing the release of his tax returns.
Judge Carl Nichols handed down a 19-page ruling, finding the US District Court in Washington, D.C., does not have jurisdiction to hear the case.
Trump sued New York's attorney general, tax commissioner, and the House and Ways Means Committee in July, seeking an injunction to block the application of a New York state law known as the TRUST Act that could allow the Democratic-controlled House to obtain the tax returns.
The House committee and its chairman, Representative Richard Neal of Massachusetts, have not requested Trump's New York state tax returns. But the lawsuit was filed preemptively, citing concerns that the panel could use the TRUST Act to try to procure Trump's state returns.
Trump has refused to release his tax returns since he was a presidential candidate and is the only modern president who hasn't made that financial information public.
The TRUST Act, which was signed into law in July 2019, allows state officials to access the tax returns of certain government officials, including the president, if the tax returns are requested by a congressional tax committee and have been requested for a legitimate legislative purpose.
Trump's attorney, Jay Sekulow, said he was reviewing the ruling.
New York's attorney general, Letitia James, said in a statement that she was "pleased with the court's conclusion."
In a separate case, a federal appeals court ruled earlier this month that Trump's tax returns can be turned over to New York prosecutors by his personal accountant in response to a grand jury subpoena.
Associated Press
Trump's public appearances become a referendum
President Trump had just begun to speak on an outdoor stage here at Madison Square Park in front of a couple of hundred military veterans when the whistles and catcalls could be heard from beyond the security perimeter where crowds had gathered, along with a chant: "Lock him up!"
High above, in the windows of the tall buildings overlooking the park, a handful of makeshift signs were also visible: "IMPEACH" and "Dump Trump."
If Trump had hoped to kick off his hometown's annual Veterans Day parade with an apolitical tribute to the armed forces, he instead was treated to another reminder that virtually every one of his public appearances has turned into a referendum on his presidency amid the mounting impeachment inquiry by House Democrats.
From loud boos at Nationals Park in Washington, D.C., last month to a huge ovation at a college football game in Tuscaloosa, Ala., this past weekend, Trump has faced a real-time voice vote from the American electorate, with nearly a year to go before ballots are cast on Election Day.
"It's an indication of just how deeply polarizing President Trump is that he has to kind of carefully cherry-pick stadiums or universities or venues because chances are he's going to get booed, or the boos will be louder than the cheers," said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University.
As the first sitting president to participate in the Veterans Day parade in New York, Trump mostly stayed away from politics during his remarks, though he highlighted the US Special Forces operation last month that ended in the death of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, which has become part of his campaign stump speech.
After presiding over a wreath-laying and a moment of silence, Trump returned to his motorcade, which sped down the parade route along Fifth Avenue and pulled up to Trump Tower.
The president entered his private residence before the parade began.
Washington Post
Veteran N.Y. Republican in House says he will retire
Representative Peter T. King, the longest-serving Republican in New York's congressional delegation, said Monday that he would retire, joining a growing exodus of Republicans from Congress before the 2020 elections.
King, who is serving his 14th term in the House, said in a statement that his decision was primarily motivated by the desire to end the weekly commute to Washington after nearly three decades and have “more flexibility" to spend time with his children and grandchildren.
But in an interview, King conceded that the toxic political environment in Washington and the uncertainties of a coming impeachment proceeding against President Trump had underscored his sense that it was time to leave.
“Something was building for a while," King said. The difficulties of coordinating his Thanksgiving and Christmas travel plans with family amid the unknowns of the impeachment battle, he said, “somehow became like a metaphor" fueling his decision.
The exit of King, 75, comes as a growing number of Republicans have decided to retire rather than seek reelection as they eye the grim political realities for their party, including the prospect of sharing a ticket with an unpopular president.
King is the 20th House Republican to depart Congress at the end of 2020 because of retirement or seeking another office.

McConnell: Bevin 'had a good four years,' but probably lost
Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, said Kentucky's governor, Matt Bevin, "had a good four years," but he says a review of Bevin's narrow reelection defeat is unlikely to change the outcome.
Bevin trailed Democrat Andy Beshear by about 5,000 votes in the Nov. 5 election. A recanvass of votes is scheduled Thursday.
McConnell said he's "sorry Matt came up short." He said that the recanvass is unlikely to change the election results, and that "barring some dramatic reversal on the recanvass, we'll have a different governor in three weeks."
Bevin has refused to concede and cited voting irregularities in the governor's race but has not provided evidence. Some Republican leaders have said Bevin should accept the results of the recanvass if Beshear's lead holds.
"My first election was almost the same number of votes that Beshear won by. We had a recanvass, added them up, it didn't change, and we all moved on," McConnell said.
McConnell was asked whether he was concerned about the results of the governor's race ahead of his own reelection effort next year. Republicans won all the down-ticket races in Kentucky, despite Bevin's apparent defeat.
"Well, we'll find out, because the 2020 election is underway already," McConnell said.

Its subject is Mark Borchardt, 33, an oddball, funny and troubled resident of Menomonee Falls, just beyond Milwaukee's northwest corner.
Borchardt's passion since his early teens has been horror filmmaking. His talent is suspect, but his determination is unparalleled.
Milwaukee filmmaker Chris Smith, now 29, was editing a documentary at UW-Milwaukee when he met Borchardt in 1995. Borchardt's drive impressed Smith so much that he started filming Borchardt.
``American Movie,'' as a result, ``is not about filmmaking. That's the hardest perception we have to overcome,'' Smith said.
``It wouldn't have mattered if Mark was golfing or driving in demolition derbies. It's about Mark and his relationships with his family and friends and the journey he goes on, trying to make this film.''
Smith, ``American Movie's'' director, experienced his own odyssey over several years to finish the documentary.
Working with cohort Sarah Price, Smith spent two years following Borchardt through crummy jobs, family woes and constant roadblocks while Borchardt made the short horror flick ``Coven.''
``American Movie's'' early footage helped attract financial backing from an unlikely source: rock musician Michael Stipe. The R.E.M. frontman co-founded a production company devoted to independent film.
Still, it took last winter's Sundance Film Festival to launch ``American Movie'' into the spotlight. Sundance screenings of ``Movie'' prompted a bidding war between distributors, and Sony won after offering nearly $1 million.
``Sundance is like high school,'' Smith said with a laugh. ``If there's word of mouth about something, everyone wants to see it.''
But documentaries face uphill battles to reach theaters, which makes the fact ``American Movie'' will run in art movie houses nationwide during the next few months more impressive.
``American Movie'' debuted on a single screen each in Milwaukee and New York last weekend. The film reaches Madison today at the Orpheum Theatre's small auditorium.
``It appeals to people in their 20s,'' said Smith, calling by phone from Houston before promotional appearances there.
``College students can appreciate it because it's funny and there are these unforgettable characters. For people (ages) 25 to 30 it hits them in a different way, because they're trying to balance maintaining dreams and making a living.''
A native of the Lansing, Mich., area, Smith attended UW-Madison for one year in 1990-1991, then transferred to the University of Iowa.
``(Iowa) had more of a film production department at the time,'' Smith said.
In the mid-'90s, Smith moved to Milwaukee when UW-Milwaukee allowed him to use its editing equipment for another documentary he made.
Then Smith began ``American Movie,'' which presents an unflinching look at Borchardt (the father of three) and his friend Mike Schank, who reels from past drug abuse.
Smith believes audiences will laugh with them, not at them.
``They're original characters,'' Smith said. ``(Borchardt) does things in an unorthodox way. That's the beauty of him.''
Smith hopes to arrange a question-and-answer session in Madison for himself, Borchardt and Schank after a screening at the Orpheum on Thursday.
Despite the film's countless accolades, Smith relishes having ``American Movie'' presented at the Orpheum.
``That's where I saw so many movies,'' he said. ``It was part of my education.''

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.

Hank Willis Thomas is a conceptual artist and sculptor who has made a name for himself as a vigilant translator of the human body into something enormously meaningful and totemic. More than a decade before the phrase “personal branding” became synonymous with regular, everyday social media culture, Thomas was making images of black men with the Nike swoosh emblazoned on their skulls to draw a link between “how slaves were branded as a kind of ownership, and [how] today we brand ourselves,” as he’s quoted as saying in the 2015 book Stick to the Skin: African American and Black British Art, 1965-2015. Thomas’ latest piece of public sculpture has now found a home on Tillary and Adams Street, adjacent to the Brooklyn Bridge. The work is titled Unity, and it consists of an enormous human arm pointing its index finger directly up into the sky.
New York Times art critic Martha Schwendener wasn’t overly enthused by the piece. “Muscular and appropriately proportioned, it suggests the arm of an athlete, echoing a smaller sculpture of an arm spinning a basketball on the tip of a finger that Mr. Thomas conceived in 2015,” she writes.
“ Unity was originally called ‘We’re No. #1,’ a more assertive title, perhaps recalling the historical competition between the boroughs that reaches back to the 19th century,” Schwendener speculates further. “ Unity is a traditional and fairly conservative work, accompanied in the official news release by a statement that sounds politician-worthy: ‘This sculpture is a homage to, and celebration of, the unique and multifaceted character of the borough of Brooklyn,’ Mr. Thomas says. ‘The spirit of Brooklyn has always been about upward mobility and connection to roots.'”

“The $284,000 project is also meant to pay homage to the borough’s unique character,” Artforum writes, not commenting on whether that aim was felt to be successful. And The New York Post captured opinions of passers-by, who made connections between everything from an Islamic hand gesture to Kings County Pride.
Once the sculpture has been around for a while longer, it seems inevitable that more opinions about it will pop up. However, it’s possible that maybe Unity’s frank simplicity isn’t quite weird enough to catch the attention of New Yorkers.

Texto completo: While President Donald Trump will welcome the Turkish leader to the White House on Wednesday, the last visit of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in May of 2017 still echoes in Washington, D.C., when security guards for the Turkish President openly attacked protesters in an unprecedented act of violence less than two miles from the White House.
With video that showed Erdoğan watching the pitched battle along what's known as "Embassy Row" in the middle of Washington, D.C. - the Turkish leader's planned return drew sharp comments from Capitol Hill in recent days, as none of his guards were ever held accountable for the violence.
"This behavior is sadly routine for President Erdoğan on Turkish soil," said Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY), who asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in a letter this week to 'immediately' expel any of the guards involved in that 2017 violence if they are on this week's trip to Washington.
"The Erdoğan regime's use of violence against innocent civilians anywhere is inhumane, uncivilized, and unacceptable," Cheney wrote.
This was what the scene looked like on May 16, 2017, as Turkish security forces broke through police lines, and openly attacked protesters on the streets of the nation's capital.
Some of the most graphic video was shot by the Voice of America's Turkish Service.

At least nine people were injured in the attacks, which took place several hours after the Turkish leader met with President Trump.
An in-depth review of multiple videos of the May 16, 2017, violence left no doubt as to the actions of the Erdoğan security detail, with descriptions of guards who 'punched a protestor' or 'kicked man on ground,' and 'knocked over woman, kicked man,' or 'choked, slammed woman.'
You can see the New York Times video analysis of the violence at this link.
In court documents revealed in recent days, U.S. security officials said the Turkish bodyguards also attacked American Secret Service agents during the incident, but were quickly spirited out of the country, and thus avoided any legal charges.
A grand jury in Washington, D.C. indicted 15 Turkish security guards, but most of the charges were ultimately dropped.
Several months after the incident, the Turkish leader said in an interview that President Trump had apologized for the incident - the White House denied that had occurred.

The bad news for Deval Patrick

Texto completo: The good news for former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick, who is considering entering the presidential race, is that it's relatively easy to become a candidate.
He is least 35 years old and is a natural-born citizen of the United States, as the Constitution requires.
The actual process of getting on the ballot largely involves some paperwork and a little bit of money.
The bad news for Patrick: everything else.
After filing the paperwork, it will be tremendously hard for Patrick if he actually aims to be the Democratic presidential nominee, let alone be the next president.
If Patrick is just floating a trial balloon, here are a few reasons why, with about 90 days until the New Hampshire primary, the balloon won't float.
It's just too late
It has been 11 months since Patrick announced that he would not be a candidate for president. Had he begun his run then, the conversation would be different.
Now,he would be the 18th Democrat running. Those already in the race have scooped up all the talented staff, have already bought the expensive voter file lists, and have had volunteers making direct contact with voters for months. Many have already begun advertising in early states.
Patrick believes that none of those in the field have momentum, according to the New York Times. But it is hard to see how Patrick would have any time to get momentum going himself.
Patrick has never experienced how fund-raising works in 2019
A very important but often overlooked point of the 2020 presidential race: the fundamentally different way candidates raise money. The move to raising small-dollar recurring donations instead of fat cats giving the maximum allowed has been slowly happening over the past few election cycles.
But it looks nothing like Patrick's last race in 2010. Back then, small-dollar contributions were a talking point about grass-roots support, but now it is the only way that at least two top-tier candidates — Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders — are reliably raising millions of dollars each month.
Building lists of potential recurring supporters is hard. But should Patrick forgo the small-dollar donor route and rely on big donors for the bulk of his fund-raising, it will mean time spent at high-end fund-raisers at law firm offices and swanky restaurants instead of on the trail in the early states.
And the price of entry is high. Entrepreneur Andrew Yang just put down $1 million for three weeks of advertising in Iowa, just to see whether he can get anything going there. He is expected to put down substantially more in New Hampshire, where Patrick will be expected to perform well given that he was a neighboring-state governor. Patrick, of course, doesn't have millions of dollars at the moment in a campaign account.
He won't make the debate stage
It's hard to see how Patrick even makes the debate stage. The deadline has already passed to qualify for next week's debate, so he won't be on the stage at the Washington Post/MSNBC debate in Atlanta. For the December debate, the DNC has set a threshold of having at least 200,000 individual donors.
Patrick walks into the presidential race with e-mail addresses of potential donors that are, by definition, nine years old, meaning many aren't usable anymore. And consider this: When a Patrick-affiliated Super PAC was very active in the 2018 midterm elections, it raised $728,000. But according to OpenSecrets.org, $615,000 of that came from just seven donors.
He has until Dec. 12 to get those 200,000 donors and — and! — somehow reach 4 percent in four or more polls.
So far, only six of the 17 candidates have met those standards. What is clear by now: It's deadly if candidates aren't on the stage. Indeed, no one who missed the last debate has been polling above 1 percent. They simply aren't in the conversation.
Quick! When was the last time you thought of Steve Bullock?
Which is to say: Patrick needs to figure out how to be in the conversation.
He offers nothing different in the field
Deadlines arelooming for candidates to put theirnames on state presidential primary ballots. Alabama's was last Friday and New Hampshire's is this Friday. In recent weeks,some activists in New Hampshire have mentioned Mike Bloomberg, Hillary Clinton, and former Obama attorney general Eric Holder as potential last-minute candidates who could draw excitement. No one, however, brought up Patrick.
And there could be a reason for this. If Patrick's message is to suggest that he can unite the liberal and moderate factions of the party, then it would be something that South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg has already been doing well. It's also the same message that Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker haven't had much luck with. In other words, Patrick wouldn't be offering anything new.

Questions over reairing of impeachment hearings

Texto completo: Prepare for inundation, at least during the daytime. ABC, CBS, NBC, and PBS will be covering the House's first open impeachment hearings live. Likewise many of the cable channels, including CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, and C-SPAN.
The first hearing is expected to begin at 10 a.m. on Wednesday, with diplomat William Taylor and then State Department official George Kent. The second hearing, scheduled for Friday at 11 a.m., is expected to include testimony from former US ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch.
But are televised daytime hearings “open door" enough? Will only working journalists, politicians, and frustrated soap-opera audiences be able to take in the raw testimony itself, before it has been shaped and altered by the analysts?
Last week, Bill Moyers and Michael Winship took out an ad in The New York Times urging PBS to air the Trump impeachment hearings in prime time. During Watergate, the two argued, public broadcasting stood above other networks, which only aired the hearings live, by rebroadcasting them at night — “when people who had spent all day working could come home, watch the drama play out without intrusive commentary, and become a part of the process of judgment." Disrupting regular prime-time programming for a few weeks, they wrote, “is a small price to pay for helping preserve the republic."
When PBS responded to the ad by saying it planned to re-air the hearings in prime time on its digital channel, called World, Moyers was not pleased. In a statement, he called World “a place where important programs are sent to die." “How in the world — no pun intended — does it serve democracy to hide the hearings from people who come home from work to see them but don't have cable, satellite, and internet access? If PBS were truly an alternative to corporate networks, it would repeat the hearings in prime time for the mass audience. Period."

Texto completo: Peter T. King, the longest-serving Republican in New York's congressional delegation, will join a growing Republican exodus from the House ahead of 2020.
WASHINGTON -- Representative Peter T. King, the longest-serving Republican in New York's congressional delegation, said on Monday that he would retire, joining a growing exodus of Republicans from Congress ahead of the 2020 elections.
Mr. King, who is currently serving his 14th term in the House, said in a statement that his decision was primarily motivated by the desire to end the weekly commute to Washington after nearly three decades and have "more flexibility" to spend time with his children and grandchildren.
But in an interview, Mr. King conceded that the toxic political environment in Washington and the uncertainties of a coming impeachment proceeding against President Trump had underscored his sense that it was time to leave.
"Something was building for a while," Mr. King said. The difficulties of coordinating his Thanksgiving and Christmas travel plans with family amid the unknowns of the impeachment battle, he said, "somehow became like a metaphor" fueling his decision.
The exit of Mr. King, 75, comes as a growing number of Republicans have decided to retire rather than seek re-election as they eye the grim political realities for their party, including an uphill slog to win back the House in next year's election and the prospect of sharing a ticket with an unpopular president. The dilemma is particularly acute for Republicans in suburban districts, where voters have been alienated by Mr. Trump's rhetoric and his positions. Mr. King is the 20th House Republican to depart Congress at the end of 2020 because of retirement or seeking another elected office.
Mr. King, who represents parts of Nassau County and Suffolk County as part of New York's second congressional district, said none of those concerns influenced his decision, pointing to his favorable polling numbers and a sizable war chest. More persuasive, he said, was his daughter's recent move to North Carolina, and a desire to give New York Republicans plenty of time to find a replacement candidate ahead of primary in April.
"I think it's gotten too toxic," Mr. King, a boxer, acknowledged, "but once I'm in the arena, I enjoy the battle."
He said he called Mr. Trump on Sunday to inform him of his plans, assuring the president that he would use his final months in office to vote against articles of impeachment and support Mr. Trump's re-election bid, as Republicans seek to prevent any defections in the coming weeks. The president asked him to reconsider retirement, Mr. King said, but ultimately accepted his decision.
"We can't allow impeachment to become a political issue, like a tax bill or a highway bill," Mr. King said, recalling his vote against impeachment articles against President Bill Clinton. "My concern right now is that it's become part of the political landscape now."
"When the word 'impeachment' was used, there was a quiver, a hesitation -- just using the word just shook people up," he added. "And now there's none of that."
Mr. King is also the latest in a series of seasoned moderate lawmakers to decide to depart the House, a trend that will leave the next Congress with less expertise and experience, and with fewer members who can remember a time when they reached across party lines to enact bipartisan legislation. He singled out other members of the New York delegation -- Representatives Elise Stefanik and John Katko, both Republicans, and Tom Suozzi, a Democrat -- as members he would hope would carry on that bipartisan work. (Mr. Suozzi, for his part, said "Pete King is a friend" who "can always be relied on to say exactly what he thinks.")
Mr. King built a reputation as one of the more moderate members of the Republican conference, but frequently took a hard line on immigration issues. As chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, Mr. King oversaw congressional hearings on homegrown Islamic terrorism, which critics condemned as a forum for attacking American Muslims after the Sept. 11 attacks.
On Monday, some Muslim groups, including Muslim Advocates, a national civil rights organization, greeted the news of Mr. King's departure with relief.
"Good riddance," Representative Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota and one of the first Muslim women elected to Congress, wrote on Twitter.
"Peter King is an Islamophobe who held McCarthyite hearings targeting American Muslims, said 'there are too many mosques in this country,' and blamed Eric Garner for his own death at the hands of police," she wrote, referring to an unarmed black man killed on Staten Island in a confrontation with police officers.
Mr. King himself was once an ardent backer of a terrorist group, the Irish Republican Army, previously telling The New York Times that he had no regret for his statements of support. He has celebrated his past with novels that feature an Irish-American congressman with I.R.A. ties -- a striking resemblance to Mr. King himself.
Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, praised Mr. King effusively on Monday upon the news of his retirement, saying that the congressman "stood head & shoulders above everyone else."
"He's been principled & never let others push him away from his principles," Mr. Schumer wrote on Twitter, quickly drawing public rebukes from Democrats. "He's fiercely loved America, Long Island, and his Irish heritage and left a lasting mark on all 3."
Mr. King is the third New York lawmaker to announce his departure at the end of the 116th Congress, following two veteran Democrats, Representative José E. Serrano, the nation's longest-tenured Hispanic congressman, and Representative Nita M. Lowey, the chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee. (Representative Chris Collins, the fourth-term Republican who pleaded guilty to federal securities fraud charges, already departed the chamber earlier this year.)
Representative Cheri Bustos of Illinois, who heads the House Democratic campaign arm, said that Mr. King's district "has been a pickup target of ours from day one of this cycle, and we will compete to win it in 2020."
"Republicans know their toxic health care repeal agenda and wholesale embrace of President Trump's recklessness will guarantee they remain in the minority for years to come," she said in a statement. Liuba Grechen Shirley, who lost to Mr. King last year by six points, said on Monday she was "seriously considering another run" for the seat.
Chris Pack, a spokesman for the Republican counterpart, countered in a statement thanking Mr. King for his service, saying that the district "will remain a Republican seat, thanks in no small part to the insane socialist agenda of Democrats in both Washington and Albany."
In his statement announcing his departure, Mr. King promoted his work after the Sept. 11 attacks, his efforts to lead the storm recovery after Hurricane Sandy and his work with Mr. Clinton to negotiate the Good Friday peace agreement in Northern Ireland. Just this year, Mr. King also noted, Congress finally approved legislation that would care permanently for those who have grown deathly ill from the toxins of the rubble at the World Trade Center in Manhattan.
Mr. King, who also reflected on his childhood in Sunnyside and his work as a college student at Manhattan's West Side Railway Terminal, vowed to remain politically active after his retirement -- just not in the halls of Congress.
"I'm sure the next time something really dramatic happens, I'm going to wait for reporters to call and to go down to Washington," Mr. King said. "But nobody will call, and I will have nowhere to go."
"That's what I'm going to miss," he added, "being in the arena and being able to get things done, instead of just talking about it."

Texto completo: Pretending that sports can take place in a vacuum would have been profoundly dishonest.
Two weeks ago, I was fired as acting editor in chief of Deadspin, where I'd worked since 2009. The entire staff resigned, following me out the door after we had refused a new company mandate to "stick to sports." Jim Spanfeller, installed as chief executive of G/O Media by the private equity firm that bought the company seven months ago, called me into his office, pointed to some offending stories on our home page and had me escorted from the building.

This is the first time that I'm speaking up about my firing, and my stance remains the same as in the countless meetings with management where I explained and insisted that sports don't end when the players head back to the locker room.
We refused to "stick to sports," because we know that sports is everything, and everything is sports: It's the N.B.A. kowtowing to its Chinese business interests; it's pro sports leagues attempting to become shadow justice systems for publicity reasons; it's the opioid epidemic roiling N.F.L. locker rooms at least as hard as anywhere in Appalachia, even as the league refuses to relax its marijuana policy; it's racist fan chants chasing black players off the pitch in Italian soccer matches; it's Washington Nationals catcher Kurt Suzuki wearing a "Make America Great Again" cap at the White House. (These last two stories occurred in the past week and so were not covered on Deadspin; the "stick to sports" diktat forced the outlet to ignore the biggest sports stories in the world.)
Reporting sports with integrity requires knowing that there's no way to wall off the games from the world outside. To anyone who knows anything about sports or cares about the world outside the arena, the notion that sports should or even can be covered merely by box scores and transaction wires is absurd.
From the moment Deadspin was founded in 2005, the website took for granted that what happened off the field was at least as important as the goings-on between the lines, and that there was no way to unravel the two. Deadspin's approach was a reaction to the predominant strain of sportswriting at the time, which treated athletes as either Greek demigods unconcerned with the dealings of the world or spoiled millionaires playing children's games.
We wanted to show the world the reality of sports, to help readers and players alike understand the labor issues, the politics, the issues of race and class that don't materially change when the power dynamic is owner/player. In 2014, we obtained audio of then-Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling's racist rant against what he considered ungrateful black employees. "Do I make the game, or do they make the game?" Sterling said. Deadspin's position was that it's all in the game.
Why would anyone buy Deadspin to change Deadspin? It's hard to understand why Great Hill Partners demanded that we "stick to sports" -- especially at a time when the site was driving the conversation in sports coverage and had the highest traffic in its history -- until you realize that this was most likely their plan. It's the private equity model: Purchase an asset, strip it of everything of value, then turn around and sell the brand to someone else before they realize that what made the brand valuable in the first place has been lost and can never be recovered (the low-quality, un-bylined articles sweatily posted to the site after the mass resignations bear this out).
This strategy is cynical enough when the victim is something like Toys 'R' Us; it's a societal crisis when it comes for journalism.
And come for journalism it has. In recent years, we've seen the deaths (and to varying degrees, the troubled rebirths) of the likes of Newsweek, The Denver Post, LA Weekly, Playboy and just last month, the granddaddy of all sports media, Sports Illustrated. It plays out the same way each time: The new owners come in, slash staff and costs and turn a once-proud publication into a content mill churning out bland and unimportant stories that no one wants or needs to read.

It's going to keep happening, faster than new outlets can rise up to replace the gutted old. For every refreshing new outlet, two will be zombified. Corners will be sanded down. Bitter pills puréed to a beige pap. Everything you liked about the web will be replaced with what the largest number of people like, or at least tolerate enough to click on and sit through three seconds of an autoplay ad. Unique voices will be muted, or drowned out altogether.
That's precisely what happened to Deadspin, which for 14 successful and profitable years possessed a distinct and inimitable voice, only to see its entire mission statement detonated in an instant by the whims of private equity. If forced to stick to sports, Deadspin isn't Deadspin.
Deadspin was the voice of the long-suffering fan, finding the humor and the heartbreak in everything in the world of sports. It was the fan wondering why he was paying $ 200 to go to a football game to watch a team whose owner would rather pocket profit than pay to improve the roster. It was also the fan troubled by the culture and the politics of sports, the fan who couldn't help noticing that the larger issues of the real world spilled onto the field. Sticking to sports, pretending that sports can take place in a vacuum, would have been profoundly dishonest.

Undocumented, but free health care?

Texto completo: The leaders of Floridas two major political parties squared off less than a year before Election Day, throwing partisan jabs over health care and immigration.

Florida Democratic Party chairwoman Terrie Rizzo called out Republican efforts to undermine the Affordable Care Act established under former President Barack Obama. Republican Party of Florida chairman Joe Gruters said it is Democrats with a health care problem.

Gruters, a state senator from Sarasota, referenced the first presidential primary debate in June, in which moderators asked the crowded field to raise their hands if they supported certain positions.

All the Democrats on the entire stage  every Democratic candidate said they want to give free health care to illegals, Gruters said during a Tampa Bay Times event on Nov. 6. Thats them saying, thats what they said in the debate. It wasnt me saying it. They raised their hands  every single one of them  free health care for illegals.

In the middle of his reply, Rizzo said: Fact-check it!

It wasnt the first time PolitiFact heard this claim. President Donald Trump used a similar attack in a July ad for his re-election campaign, and it rates Mostly False. Gruters statement is not more accurate, and heres why.

What happened with the Democrats in June

At the first Democratic presidential debate in Miami in June, NBC debate moderator and Today show co-host Savannah Guthrie asked a group of candidates to raise your hand if your government plan would provide coverage for undocumented immigrants.

All candidates on stage raised their hands. They werent all the candidates, because the first presidential debate was split into two nights.

On the stage were author Marianne Williamson, former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, entrepreneur Andrew Yang, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Sen. Kamala Harris of California, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado, and Rep. Eric Swalwell of California. (Hickenlooper, Gillibrand and Swalwell have dropped out.)

The candidates were not asked if that coverage would be free. Guthrie then asked two candidates  Buttigieg and Biden  to comment. Neither one said they would give free health care to undocumented immigrants.

Buttigieg spoke about people buying into a system and said that undocumented immigrants pay certain taxes.

This is not about a handout, Buttigieg said. This is an insurance program.

Biden agreed, and spoke about the contributions by undocumented immigrants, including paying taxes.

So the debate Gruters mentioned doesnt actually support what Gruters claimed. But there is some question about how Medicare for All, a proposal some of the Democratic candidates support, would treat health care costs for undocumented immigrants.

Sanders version is a single, national health insurance program that would cover everyone who lives in the United States. There would be no out-of-pocket costs to individuals  no deductibles, no copays or coinsurance  but anyone with a job or self-employed would pay into the system through taxes. In that sense, coverage would not be free for anyone who works. (Some immigrants in the country illegally pay income taxes.)

Sanders 2019 Medicare for All bill states that all residents  without specifying legal residents  are entitled to the benefits and that the health and human services secretary shall set criteria to determine residency.

Sanders immigration plan says Medicare for All will provide comprehensive care to everyone in America, regardless of immigration status. It also calls for employers to follow labor laws when employing undocumented immigrants, which suggests that they would pay the payroll tax.

However, some of the other Democrats on the debate stage specifically responded to a New York Times questionnaire with replies that showed the coverage would not be free.

Buttigieg, Bennet and Yang said undocumented immigrants would have the option to buy coverage through a public option, the insurance marketplace, or Medicare for All, respectively.

Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, one of the top contenders and another advocate for Medicare for All, was not on the debate stage that night. (She went the night before.)

Her detailed financial plan for Medicare for All includes a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, which would increase federal revenue for Medicare for All as new people come into the system and pay taxes.

When PolitiFact told Gruters what we found  mainly that the debate question did not include the condition that it would be free coverage  he replied: Illegal immigrants have little more than what they are carrying with them when they cross the border, so as a result the only logical conclusion is that it would be free.

Our ruling

Gruters said, All the Democrats on the entire stage  every Democratic candidate said they want to give free health care to illegals.

The question from the debate moderator did not specify if coverage for undocumented immigrants would be free. Two candidates who elaborated on their responses  Biden and Buttigieg  said these immigrants would be eligible to buy into their system.

We rate this statement Mostly False.

Bret Stephens: Bloomberg should run because he can win

Texto completo: Mike Bloomberg should run for president, for two reasons that ought to be dispositive. First, he would be a very good president, potentially a great one. Second, he stands a much better chance of beating Donald Trump than anyone in the current Democratic field.
The main question is whether Democrats are inclined to allow the former New York City mayor to save them from themselves.
Until last week, the conventional wisdom was that they weren’t so inclined. Then came that New York Times Upshot/Siena College poll showing Trump competitive with, or ahead of, Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren in the six battleground states that will likely decide the 2020 election.
If Trump is this strong now , in the midst of his impeachment woes and all the general distaste for him, where is he going to be in 11 months in a contest against opponents with nicknames like “Sleepy Joe,” “Crazy Bernie” or “Uber Left Elizabeth Warren”?
This was no doubt the thought that induced Bloomberg to hurriedly dispatch staffers to Alabama to file primary paperwork in time for its Friday deadline. The case against a Bloomberg candidacy is that he can’t possibly win the nomination when so many Democratic primary voters want to cancel billionaires, soak the rich and relitigate the crime-fighting strategies that defined his 12-year tenure as mayor.
But the case for a Bloomberg candidacy is stronger and infinitely simpler: In a field divided between politically feeble centrists, unelectable progressives and one talented but awfully young small-city mayor, he ... can ... win.
How so?
Because his money instantly neutralizes the Trump campaign’s formidable fundraising advantage, which as of last month had twice as much cash on hand as the Obama campaign did at the same stage of his reelection campaign.
Because he also neutralizes Trump’s strongest reelection argument, which is that “whether you love me or hate me, you’ve got to vote for me.” The right’s charge-sheet against today’s Democrats is that they hate capitalism, hate Israel, hate the cops, think of America as a land of iniquity, and never met a tax or regulation they didn’t love. Against Bloomberg it all falls flat.
Because his views on gun control, abortion and climate change fit squarely in the Democratic mainstream without being obnoxious or frightening to middle-of-the-road America. The Democratic base will not sit out the election and squander its chances to oust Trump just because Bloomberg’s wealth offends them or because they won’t vote for a candidate who doesn’t embrace the Green New Deal.
Because even his opponents know there can be no gainsaying his ability to serve as president; or his talent for appointing competent deputies; or his mastery of the mechanics of government; or his overwhelmingly successful tenure as New York mayor; or his understanding of business and the economy; or his immediate credibility on the world stage; or his sobriety of judgment or general probity of character. Mike Bloomberg has donated more money — at least $6 billion — than Donald Trump has ever had.
Because the voters who will matter in the election — that is, those who live neither in deep blue nor deep red states — want a centrist. Democrats in Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Arizona and Florida tell pollsters they want “a Democratic nominee who is more moderate than most Democrats” and that they prefer “one who would bridge the partisan divide,” according to a report Friday from my colleagues Jonathan Martin and Katie Glueck.
Oh, and because Bloomberg is what Trump only pretends to be: a bona fide billionaire and proven entrepreneur. In 2012, the Romney campaign tried to create a contest between “makers and takers.” A Bloomberg-Trump contest would be one between a maker and a faker.
All this should terrify the Trump campaign. Yes, Bloomberg has some weaknesses as a candidate. These include age (77), a less-than-charismatic speaking style, a reputation as a scold who wants to take away your supersized fizzy drink, his (Trumpian) reluctance to release his full tax returns, and the fact that he’s a technocratic master-of-the-universe in an era of populist demagoguery.
None of these should be deal-breakers for any persuadable voter. The real question is whether Democrats can quickly get the message that, contrary to what many of them have supposed, the election is not theirs to lose. A candidate who flubs his lines against Trump will yield the same disastrous result as one who sounds like the Party Line.
Of course, the Democrats could always get lucky. The recession might arrive by Easter. A convincing process of, and vote for, impeachment in the House could move a few Senate Republicans to vote for conviction. Some other major Trumpian scandal might come to light.
But if trouncing Donald Trump is essential to the preservation of liberal democracy, then it won’t do to cross fingers and hope he stumbles. A Bloomberg candidacy would be a gift to Democrats, the country and the world. Sneer at it at your peril.

Texto completo: "Every generation blames the one before." - Mike + The Mechanics
So I guess "OK Boomer" is a thing now. And I gather I'm supposed to be offended by it. Certainly, some people seem to be.
The saying - a dismissive eye roll from Generation Z to their elders - is suddenly all the rage. It appears on hoodies, headlines, tweets and memes, this catch-all response to old folks' nonstop nagging and criticism. Some members of the Baby Boom generation are not amused.
Maureen Dowd of the New York Times sees it as "intergenerational war." Steve Cuozzo of the New York Post says the young ones "really, really hate us." Bob Lonsberry, a conservative radio host, declared "boomer" - no joke - "the n-word of ageism."
Granted, these are media types - not real people - so we should be careful about generalizing. I, for one, can't say I really feel "hate" from young folks. But to whatever degree I should be taking this seriously, I find that I can't. I keep laughing instead.
It strikes me as funny that some in my generation, which defined itself by an insolent rejection of the old, are traumatized by a younger generation's insolent rejection of us. Am I the only one who remembers when Pete Townshend sneered, "Hope I die before I get old"?
Then how dare any of us clutch our pearls over a little intergenerational sniping? Besides, it's not as if the kids don't have a point. Our record is certainly mixed.
I'd say our music was better than theirs, but they have better television - and more of it - than we could've dreamt. Boomers made great strides in civil rights for black people, women and LGBTQ folks. But we dropped the ball on climate change, and failed to address a rigged financial system. We deserve both credit and castigation. Every generation does - even the "Greatest."
When I was a kid, I used to tease this old man in the neighborhood for being an old man in the neighborhood. "Keep a'livin'," he'd always retort. And I did. And here I am, just turned 62 and wondering how the heck that happened. The Gen Z kids will too soon enough wonder the selfsame thing. The big wheel keeps on turning.
Usually that confers perspective and context, the soil from which wisdom grows. But you couldn't prove that by these overwrought responses to young people's taunts.
I'm remembering teenage battles with my mom as I write this. As it happens, I've got Nat King Cole playing in the background. He was mom's end-all and be-all. She didn't want to hear any noise from my room about P-Funk getting funked up, Papa being a rolling stone or midnight trains to Georgia. As far as she was concerned, music stopped when King Cole died. I got sick of hearing his name, scorned him on general principle.
But I remember one day Mom deigned to listen to the Stylistics with me. Afterward, she sniffed that "Betcha By Golly Wow" was actually a pretty song to have such a silly title. It was a backhanded compliment, but I felt vindicated by it just the same. Somewhere in the intervening decades, I decided Cole wasn't so bad either. I just had to learn how to hear him - and I did.
So the kids may "OK" this Boomer to their heart's content. Because as they will eventually discover, that old man in my neighborhood was right: Keep a'livin' indeed.

Texto completo: A cold snap is expected to break temperature records in much of the U.S. this week.
Winter is officially more than a month away. But an Arctic blast packing the coldest air of the season is headed toward much of the United States, threatening to break dozens of daily temperature records and prompting some Veterans Day organizers to make new plans.
Temperatures will be 15 to 25 degrees below normal over the eastern two-thirds of the United States early in the week, the National Weather Service said. The agency expects record-setting cold for Monday through Wednesday, and the chilliest temperatures are forecast for Wednesday on the East Coast.
It is the second Arctic front to cross part of the country in recent days; the first caused temperatures to drop on the East Coast from Thursday into Saturday morning.
The polar plunge -- with temperatures that are more typical of January -- will be felt deepest in the Northern Plains and upper Midwest on Sunday, in the Southern Plains and Ohio Valley on Monday, and in the South on Tuesday.
Residents of the Twin Cities face a 19-degree forecast Monday that would challenge a record set in 1986, according to the National Weather Service office there. One silver lining: No snow is predicted.
Lows will tumble into the single digits in the Plains, most likely on Monday night and into Tuesday. By then, the eastern third of the country will be on deck for the blast, with lows in the 20s on Wednesday.
In parts of the Florida Panhandle, residents who were sweating through blazing heat early this month may be bundling up in coats on Wednesday and Thursday, as temperatures plummet into the 30s. The rest of the state will be only a few degrees cooler than usual.
The weather predictions are unwelcome news for organizers of Veterans Day ceremonies across the country on Monday.
The forecast may not be as unusual as a temperature swing on Nov. 11, 1911, when both a record high of 82 degrees and a record low of 13 degrees were recorded in Columbia, Mo. But it is causing some worry nonetheless.
The National World War I Museum and Memorial in Kansas City, Mo., is hosting a full slate of events over the weekend, but is taking precautions for an expected spike in visitor traffic. A ceremony on Monday will be held indoors, said Mike Vietti, communications director for the museum.
In Minnesota, a group of a couple of dozen veterans was planning to walk 11 miles from Minneapolis to the State Capitol in St. Paul on Monday to commemorate the signing of the Armistice on Nov. 11, 1918. At the Capitol, they will ring a replica Liberty Bell 11 times at 11 a.m. (The forecast, at least, is a tad higher than 11 degrees.)
"We're used to the cold; it's just going to be a stroll for us," said Michael McDonald, 70, who served as an Army Reserve soldier during the Vietnam War. He said that the group, made up mostly of Vietnam veterans, would be fine as long as it was "above zero."
Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs contributed reporting.

Technology shapes the truth - but how?

Texto completo: From the dawn of the printing press to the rise of the internet, technology has always shaped the truth. Its contribution has rarely been neutral. While the printing press planted the seeds of Western civilization, it also amplified some voices and muted many others. Freedom of the press, as A.J. Liebling once famously wrote, became "limited to those who own one."
When it comes to today's mediaverse, technology has a pronounced light and dark side. Its sweeping influence often lies hidden behind our clicks, with our data actively harvested, monetized and even weaponized. Of course, the 2016 U.S. presidential election catapulted this dark side of technology to the forefront. Through the Cambridge Analytica scandal, for instance, we saw firsthand how, in our pursuit of understanding this world through social media, of sharing our lives, likes and preferences, technology can be used against us.
And while we can and should express great alarm at these dark capabilities, so, too, does technology show us a powerful side of good, of light. Journalists can now use artificial intelligence to comb through highly complex data sets (e.g. from the Panama Papers) or use crowd-sourced videos, photos and satellite imagery to reconstruct the truth. In this way, technology enables entirely new avenues of discovery and understanding.
As it has always done, technology actively sculpts our truths. And so, our role as producers and consumers of media is to be as educated as we can about its full and complex societal role. To that end, the Santa Fe Council on International Relations is convening its second annual Journalism under Fire conference Nov. 14 and 15. This year, the conference asks this very simple yet wonderfully complex question: How does technology shape the truth?
As the conference organizer, I asked a selection of our coming speakers for their views on both the light and dark side of technology in shaping those collective truths.
The dark side
Malachy Browne, a senior producer at the New York Times specializing in visual investigations, declares that "Technology has weaponized an information disorder that has long existed, and personalized it. Major tech companies are incentivized to profile us, understand us, and trigger our emotional impulses." Echoing this, professor Braden Allenby of Arizona State University told me, "Technology has resulted in a tsunami of information, for which neither individuals nor their institutions are adequately prepared. The result is a profound detachment of rationality from underlying facts, and a retreat to simple and more tribal narratives. This isn't so much a single impact as a foundational historic shift."
Two-time Pulitzer Prize winner Dana Priest of the Washington Post returns to Santa Fe again this year. On this topic of social media, she told me, "Social media companies gave users a free platform to reach millions; but they also manipulate and spy on those users in ways we don't realize and haven't clearly agreed to. Money hijacked the idealism of connecting the world years ago, and they will not give it up without a fight."
Alexa Koenig, the executive director of the Human Rights Center at the University of California, Berkeley, points instead to the dangers of algorithms curating information for users, "providing them with information that reinforces (as opposed to challenges) their world view, or that emphasizes salacious material over fact-based information. This means that the bubbles of information around us are hardening, creating an even more rigid barrier between us and those who don't share our opinions and circles of information. The lack of shared facts can make it very difficult for a democracy to function."
For professor Janet Steele of George Washington University, "The playing field is asymmetrical, and media literacy campaigns seem like a pallid response to disinformation that is disseminated by bots and amplified by 'influencers,' 'buzzers' and 'cyber-troopers.' The dilemma is that for liberal democracies, what is there to rely on other than the conviction that the truth will ultimately win out?"
The light side
Pulitzer Prize winner Matthew Rosenberg of the New York Times points to how the internet has become "An incredible force multiplier. Records that once could only be read by taking a trip down to city hall or the local courthouse can now be pulled up online. That's a huge boon for reporters, giving us a lot more time to focus on other reporting and going deeper on stories. And we now have metrics that tell us pretty clearly that readers will engage with deeply reported stories, even long ones."
Sam Gregory, of the WITNESS program studying deep fakes and other artificial intelligence issues, tells me that, "We shouldn't lose sight of the tremendous power of social media and mobile technology in the hands of communities who never had a loud voice or the media and power on their side -- their videos are the raw material of contemporary accountability, and of ensuring that a broader range of real experiences of communities fighting injustice get seen."
Koenig echoes this by remarking, "The spread of smartphones and the rise of social media is empowering fact-finders from all over the world to 'access' crises that are physically inaccessible -- whether for security or diplomatic reasons -- and share information about those crises with those in a position to do something about it."
This creation of raw data, of different perspectives, creates, for Malachy Browne, "a trove of documentary evidence that can help us deconstruct an event and get to the truth of it."
So exactly how does technology shape our truth? Join the Santa Fe Council on International Relations on Nov. 14 and 15 to discover that for yourself. Some tickets remain at www.sfcir.org.

It strikes me as funny that some in my generation, which defined itself by an insolent rejection of the old, are traumatized by a younger generation's insolent rejection of us. Am I the only one who remembers when the hippies warned, "Don't trust anyone over 30?" Does no one else recall when Pete Townshend sneered, "Hope I die before I get old"?
Then how dare any of us clutch our pearls over a little intergenerational sniping? Besides, it's not as if the kids don't have a point. Our record is certainly mixed.

We deserve both credit and castigation. Every generation does - even the "Greatest."

Still, somewhere in the intervening decades, I decided Cole wasn't so bad either. I just had to learn how to hear him - and I did.
So the kids may "OK" this Boomer to their heart's content. Because as they will eventually discover, that old man in my neighborhood was right.

So I guess "OK Boomer" is a thing now. And I gather I'm supposed to be offended by it. Certainly, some people seem to be.
The saying – a dismissive eye roll from Generation Z to their elders – is suddenly all the rage. It appears on hoodies, headlines, tweets and memes, this catch-all response to old folks' nonstop nagging and criticism. Some members of the Baby Boom generation are not amused.
Maureen Dowd of The New York Times sees it as an "intergenerational war." Steve Cuozzo of The New York Post says the young ones "really, really hate us." Bob Lonsberry, a conservative radio host, declared "boomer" - no joke - "the n-word of ageism."
Granted, these are media types – not real people – so we should be careful about generalizing. I, for one, can't say I really feel "hate" from young folks. But to whatever degree I should be taking this seriously – "You darn kids, get off my internet!" – I find that I can't. I keep laughing instead.
It strikes me as funny that some in my generation, which defined itself by an insolent rejection of the old, are traumatized by a younger generation's insolent rejection of us. Am I the only one who remembers when the hippies warned, "Don't trust anyone over 30?" Does no one else recall when Pete Townshend sneered, "Hope I die before I get old"?
Then how dare any of us clutch our pearls over a little intergenerational sniping?
Besides, it's not as if the kids don't have a point. Our record is certainly mixed.
I'd say our music was better than theirs, but they have better television – and more of it – than we could've dreamt. Boomers made great strides in civil rights for black people, women and the LGBTQ. But we dropped the ball on climate change, failed to address a rigged financial system. And we – the white cohort of us at least - bear blame for the catastrophe of Trump. We deserve both credit and castigation. Every generation does – even the "Greatest."
When I was a kid, I used to tease this old man in the neighborhood for being an old man in the neighborhood. "Keep a'livin'," he'd always retort. And I did. And here I am, just turned 62 and wondering how the heck that happened. The Gen Z kids will too soon enough wonder the selfsame thing. The big wheel keeps on turning.
Usually, that confers perspective and context, the soil from which wisdom grows. But you couldn't prove that by these overwrought responses to young people's taunts.
I'm remembering teenage battles with my mom as I write this. As it happens, I've got Nat King Cole playing in the background. He was mom's end-all and be-all. She didn't want to hear any noise from my room about P-Funk getting funked up, Papa being a rolling stone or midnight trains to Georgia. As far as she was concerned, music stopped when King Cole died. I got sick of hearing his name, scorned him on general principle.
But I remember one day mom deigned to listen to the Stylistics with me. Afterward, she sniffed that "Betcha By Golly Wow" was actually a pretty song to have such a silly title. It was a backhanded compliment, but I felt vindicated by it just the same. I doubt she needed my vindication – adults didn't need that from kids back then. Still, somewhere in the intervening decades, I decided Cole wasn't so bad either. I just had to learn how to hear him - and I did.
So the kids may "OK" this Boomer to their heart's content. Because as they will eventually discover, that old man in my neighborhood was right.
Keep a'livin' indeed.

Texto completo: SCARBOROUGH -- There are days, Tom Daley says, when it's lonely on top.
At 92, he's outlived many of his friends and most of the men he served with in World War II. His wife, Anita, with whom he shared 68 happy years, died on March 30, 2018.
"Let's face it, I don't have any friends left," he said. "I outlived them all."
But on the days Vietnam veteran Jerry Harkavy, of Cape Elizabeth, comes to visit, Daley can count on a good time. The men - separated in age by 16 years but both with seemingly endless energy - often go for long walks on the Eastern Trail and always share lots of laughs.
"We like to shoot the breeze. Tom does like to tell stories," Harkavy said. "His stories are so good they're worth repeating."
Harkavy and Daley, of Scarborough, met through Vet to Vet Maine, a Biddeford-based nonprofit founded in 2014 that pairs veterans for home visits. In the past five years, 100 volunteers have visited 177 veterans in southern Maine.
"We make sure veterans are not left alone at the end of their lives," said Executive Director Susan Gold. The volunteers "want to bring a little bit of joy and companionship to veterans. They go out of their way to make sure their veterans have what they need."
For some, that's a regular visit when a veteran is otherwise alone or not able to leave home. Other volunteers help their fellow veteran navigate the Veterans Administration to get services. In one case, a volunteer veteran brought an older vet to visit his wife's gravestone for the first time.
Harkavy, like many of the volunteers, brings to his role compassion, commitment to making a positive difference in the life of a fellow veteran and a genuine dedication to service, Gold said.
"They're a breed of people who believe in service. They want to continue to serve," she said. "It really makes a difference to know someone else is going through what you're going through."
Daley grew up in Lewiston and by eighth grade was working third shift in a mill that manufactured parachute cloth. At 16, he started commuting as many as seven days a week to South Portland to work at the shipyard where 236 Liberty ships were built during WWII.
Daley enlisted in the Navy in 1944 and served as a gunner on the heavy cruiser USS Saint Paul, an assignment that gave him an up-close view of both intense fighting and unfolding history. The last shots on Japan came from guns aboard the Saint Paul on Aug. 9, 1945.
Less than a month later, Daley was on the Saint Paul in Tokyo Bay when the Peace Treaty of Japan was signed aboard the nearby USS Missouri. Three months after the surrender, he was one of 50 sailors selected to tour China, where he flew over the Great Wall. Daley went on to serve in the Navy until 1960.
After the Navy, Daley returned to Maine, raised four children with his wife and taught auto mechanics and drivers' education. In recent years, while making regular visits to a friend at the Maine Veterans Home near his house in Scarborough, he heard about Vet to Vet Maine.
"I thought I would be going to visit nursing homes," he said. "They didn't tell me they were going to send someone who was going to walk my legs off."
Harkavy, 76, grew up in in the Bronx and attended New York University, where he was enrolled in ROTC. With the draft on, he enlisted in the Army in 1965 at age 22. As the war heated up, he took an information officer course and was assigned to a five-member attachment of the 173rd Airborne Brigade.
Harkavy, who had been a part-time copy boy at the New York Times before enlisting, served in Vietnam from 1967 to 1968, largely in the Central Highlands. During his time in Vietnam, Harkavy met well-known journalists and by the time his tour ended, he was in touch with the Associated Press Boston bureau chief.
Harkavy took a job as an AP reporter in Portland, where he worked as a journalist for his entire 41-year career. Since retiring 10 years ago, he has dedicated much of his time to volunteering and visiting both Daley and another veteran through Vet to Vet Maine.
"My wife says I'm busier now than when I was working. This guy keeps me busy," Harkavy said of Daley.
Harkavy wouldn't have it any other way.
"It gives purpose to my life. I so look forward to these meetings with Tom. He's just so much fun to be with. He has all these fascinating experiences in his life that he has shared with me," Harkavy said. "That's one of the things I love about this guy. I feel he's one of the last of the Greatest Generation."

Texto completo: Should you see “The Irishman" in a movie theater?
Short answer: of course you should.
Is it a shame that almost everyone will watch it at home on Netflix? Sure. But without Netflix “The Irishman" wouldn't exist.
Welcome to the state of the movie industry in 2019, when what may very well be the year's best film was essentially made for TV. This development comes at a time of loud arguments, both within and outside the industry, over how long a movie should play in theaters before becoming available elsewhere, how much we need to know about a movie's success, and what even constitutes a movie in the first place. There are winners and losers in this fight, but they're not necessarily the obvious ones.
“The Irishman" seems tailor made for the biggest screen you can find. It's a 3½-hour gangster epic from Martin Scorsese that stars Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and — as former Teamsters leader and notable missing person Jimmy Hoffa — Al Pacino. It premiered at the New York Film Festival in September to general hosannas and is currently playing a limited engagement at Broadway's Belasco Theater in New York and in Los Angeles. (The film opens here Nov. 15; the Globe's review will run then.)
How “The Irishman" came to be a Netflix film says much about the modern movie business. Because of its length and $160 million budget (all that period detail costs money, as did the computerized "de-aging" needed to make De Niro look younger in the early scenes), Scorsese's usual studio, Paramount, took a pass on the project. Streaming service Netflix, having successfully dipped its toe in the Oscar-season waters with last year's “Roma," gave the legendary filmmaker the green light. And that's when the dogfights began.
Major movie theater chains like AMC and Regal despise video-on-demand in general and Netflix in particular for eating away at their business; historically, any distributor planning to take a movie to the streaming market within 72 days of its theatrical release has been boycotted by the chains with extreme prejudice.
But a new Scorsese gangster movie? “The Departed" grossed nearly $300 million worldwide in 2006, not a sum the theatrical chains are willing to walk away from, even if a 209-minute running time would mean fewer showings and fewer tickets sold. The director himself was pushing for “The Irishman" to get maximum theatrical exposure, and two major chains, AMC and Cineplex, sat down at a negotiating table with Netflix in August to hammer out a deal.
They failed. The chains reportedly were willing to decrease the VOD window gap to 60 days, but Netflix representatives insisted on 45 days or nothing. The streaming company walked away from the table and announced that “The Irishman" would debut on Netflix Nov. 27, less than a month after its theatrical premiere. Without the chains at its disposal, the film will play independent theaters and art houses; it will screen here at the Kendall Square and the Coolidge Corner.
The response from Hollywood's old guard has been apoplectic, with John Fithian, head of the National Association of Theater Owners trade association, calling Netflix's move “a disgrace." And it does seem a little perverse. What entertainment corporation in its right capitalistic mind forgoes millions in theatrical revenue? It's almost . . . anti-money.
It's really just anti-movie ticket. Netflix is a subscription-based service, and the business model is all about keeping 158 million subscribers happy for their $12.99 a month. That regular cash pipeline does several things. It puts every movie (and TV show) on a level playing field, with art house fare and B-movies theoretically equal to the biggest blockbusters. And it serves to neutralize the need for audience metrics like theatrical box office and viewership numbers for individual titles, neither of which Netflix makes public. When you're being paid for all your content, who cares how the individual pieces are faring?
This is further sand in the machinery of the traditional film industry, which for decades has relied on such statistics to do business — to assign monetary value to projects and people and to decide what movies or shows get made or which ones are too risky. According to a source with knowledge of the company's strategies, the Netflix philosophy is “We want our movies to be watched and judged for what they are and it's not about keeping score." This may or may not be just paying lip service, but in a deeply hidebound company town, it's heresy.
Not at all coincidentally, the director of “The Irishman" has been openly talking about risk, expanding in a New York Times opinion piece on his recent comments regarding Marvel movies and art. “Many films today are perfect products manufactured for immediate consumption," Scorsese wrote. “Many of them are well made by teams of talented individuals. All the same, they lack something essential to cinema: the unifying vision of an individual artist. Because, of course, the individual artist is the riskiest factor of all."
Like it or not, Netflix is bankrolling and/or distributing some of the year's riskiest movies. Not just “The Irishman," but Noah Baumbach's upcoming “Marriage Story," with Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver as a couple splitting up, and the Eddie Murphy comeback vehicle “Dolemite Is My Name.“ There's also "The King," an expansive Henry V epic, featuring Timothée Chalamet, Steven Soderbergh's “The Laundromat," and Cannes Grand Jury winner “Atlantics." “Dolemite" didn't open in Boston theaters, but in some cases, on-demand exposure may actually prompt a wider theatrical release. According to the source mentioned above, the longer that “Roma" played on Netflix during last year's Oscar race, the more calls came in from regional movie houses inquiring about booking the film.
One thing is clear: The big theater chains still don't get it. People will watch movies where they watch them, and if they don't want to see a movie in theaters they won't, regardless of whether it's available elsewhere. Even a 2018 study funded by Fithian's NATO concluded that video on demand not only doesn't cannibalize theatrical box office but may actually complement it — that heavy streamers, it turns out, are also faithful moviegoers. If AMC and Cineplex had acceded to Netflix's demand for a short 45-day on-demand window, “The Irishman" would be on more big screens where it belongs, the theaters would be making money, and everyone would be happy — moviegoers, Netflix subscribers, and Marty.
Instead, the chains ignored a future that has already become the present. Maybe a best picture Oscar will finally get them to see that.

Texto completo: My father taught me that negotiation is not always about maximizing what you can get.
My father grew up with few material possessions. As a result, he appreciates things far more than anyone I know. Throughout my life, I watched him meticulously clean and repair just about everything we owned, be it a radio, a coat or a blender. His attention to detail extended particularly to cars. No matter what vehicle we owned, it was always kept in pristine condition, inside and out.
In 1978, my father decided to sell our Chrysler LeBaron. I was 13 years old and a trusted adviser on all things American. It was up to me to write the ad, then call it in to the PennySaver.
We had moved to California in 1972 from Abadan, Iran. My father, a mechanical engineer, loved a thousand things in America, including the really big cars, or land yachts, a term we learned from a used-car salesman. He and I visited car dealerships in Southern California the way tourists visited ancient sites in Iran, oohing and aahing at man's ability to create wonder. Our regular pilgrimages had a purpose. As much as my father loved whatever car he owned, he also loved dreaming about the next, bigger one.
We also had a weekly routine involving our own vehicle. This being pre-drought days, my dad parked our land yacht on the driveway. On cue, I would unravel the garden hose, fetch two pails, the large, soft, yellow sponges that did not scratch, rags for drying, window cleaner, and dishwasher detergent. We washed the car until it sparkled. I took great pride in my ability to shine the rims to perfection and clean the windows spotless. It may sound weird to kids today, but seeing how happy my father was at the sight of our gleaming car made me look forward to this weekly chore.
My father's love for his vehicles, however, was not limited to appearances. On any evening, you would find my dad in the garage, like Jonah halfway in the whale, his torso gulped by the hood of the car. As soon as he heard me, he would emerge, always enthusiastic about the innards of our wondrous machine. "Here, Firoozeh, you try it," he'd say, handing me the dipstick and rag. "It's important for girls to know these things." He was right about that, but my ability to retain car information was in inverse proportion to my ability to feign enthusiasm. "Wow!" I'd say. "So interesting!"
Pleased with himself, my father would then move on to the equally riveting topics of transmission fluid, coolant levels, belts and hoses, and I would continue my Meryl Streep-worthy act of pretending to be engrossed. I didn't have the heart to tell him that I didn't care at all about cars.
Needless to say, I learned nothing. But I did know that our LeBaron was in immaculate condition and was fully prepared to announce this in the thin, free pages of the PennySaver.
When it came time to decide on a price, my father wanted $ 1,000. Luckily for him, my de facto adviser position also included dispensing financial advice, so I suggested that if he wanted $ 1,000, he should ask for $ 1,200. My father, with his tendency to agree with all my ideas, good or bad, consented.
A parade of potential buyers started coming to our condo. I made sure to always be there, standing next to my father. My perfect Valley Girl English put people at ease, mitigating my father's thick Persian accent. This was before Iran ever made the nightly news, but I can attest that even back then, a thick Middle Eastern accent had the opposite effect of Maurice Chevalier saying the same thing.
One evening, a man showed up with his two daughters, who were around 8 years old. He checked out the car, while my father rambled on about its great condition and I repeated what I considered to be the key points, but sans accent. After looking under the hood, he decided to buy the car and told us that he would return the next day.
We waited with great anticipation.
As promised, he showed up the following evening, again with his daughters. After exchanging pleasantries, he removed a wad of cash from his pockets and counted twelve $ 100 bills.
My father took the bills, thanked the man but didn't put the money in his pocket. He kept staring at the wad of cash. After a moment, he peeled off two of the bills and gave them back. "This is for your beautiful daughters. Please take them to Disneyland and buy them whatever they want."
The man looked confused, almost annoyed, like he was being pranked. Even I, with my perfect English, was at a loss.
"Please," my father repeated, pushing the money into the man's palm. "You must take your daughters to Disneyland."
The girls started to squeal. The man paused for a moment, then hugged my father vigorously.
As he drove away in his new used LeBaron, I could see the sisters bouncing around the cavernous back seat, pre-mandatory seatbelt laws. They waved furiously at us until their dad turned the corner and we could no longer see them.
That evening, my father could not have been happier. He had gotten exactly what he needed and I learned a simple lesson that I carry with me still, 41 years later. When you have what you need, use the rest to bring joy into someone else's life. That is the best deal you can ever make.

Texto completo: Sanders and Warren
set sights on super-rich,
who aren't going along
The political and economic power wielded by the approximately 750 wealthiest people in America has become a sudden flash point in the 2020 presidential election, as the nation's billionaires push back with increasing ferocity against calls by liberal politicians to vastly reduce their fortunes and clout.
On Thursday, Michael Bloomberg, a billionaire and former mayor of New York City, took steps to enter the presidential race, a move that would make him one of four billionaires who either plan to seek or have expressed interest in seeking the nation's highest office in 2020. His decision came one week after Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) proposed vastly expanding her 'wealth tax' on the nation's biggest wealth holders and one month after Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said the United States should not have any billionaires at all.
The populist onslaught has ensnared Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, led to billionaire hand-wringing on cable news, and sparked a panicked discussion among wealthy Americans and their financial advisers about how to prepare for a White House controlled by populist Democrats.
Past presidential elections have involved allegations of class warfare, but rarely have those debates centered on such a small subset of people.
'For the first time ever, we are having a national political conversation about billionaires in American life. And that is because many people are noticing the vast differences in wealth and opportunity,' said Timothy Naftali, a historian at New York University.
The growing hostilities between the ascendant populist wing of the Democratic Party and the nation's tech and financial elite have spilled repeatedly into public view over the past several months, but they reached a crescendo last week with news that Bloomberg may enter the Democratic primary race. With the stock market at an all-time high, the debate about wealth accumulation and inequality has become a top issue in the 2020 campaign.
The leaders of the anti-billionaire populist surge, Warren and Sanders, have cast their plans to vastly increase taxes on the wealthy as necessary to fix several decades of widening inequality and make necessary investments in health care, child-care spending and other government programs they say will help working-class Americans.
Financial disparities between the rich and everyone else have widened over the past several decades, with inequality returning to levels not seen since the 1920s, as the richest 400 Americans now control more wealth than the bottom 60-percent of the wealth distribution, according to research by Gabriel Zucman, a left-leaning economist at the University of California at Berkeley. The poorest 60-percent of Americans have seen their share of the national wealth fall from 5.7-percent in 1987 to 2.1-percent in 2014, Zucman found.
But the efforts at redistribution pushed by Warren and Sanders have elicited a fierce and sometimes personal backlash from the billionaires who stand to lose the most. At least 16 billionaires have in recent months spoken out against what they regard as the danger posed by the populist Democrats, particularly over their proposals to enact a wealth tax on vast fortunes, with many expressing concern that they will hand the election to President Trump by veering too far left.
Bloomberg's potential presidential bid follows that of fellow billionaires Tom Steyer, a major Democratic donor, and former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, who in September suspended his independent presidential bid. Steyer has proposed his own wealth tax, but Schultz ripped the idea as 'ridiculous,' while Bloomberg suggested it was not constitutional and raised the prospect of America turning into Venezuela.
Piling on against the wealth tax have been corporate celebrities from Silicon Valley and Wall Street. Zuckerberg suggested Sanders's call to abolish billionaires could hurt philanthropies and scientific research by giving the government too much decision-making power. Microsoft co-founder Gates criticized Warren's wealth tax and mused about its impact on 'the incentive system' for making money.
David Rubenstein, the billionaire co-founder of the Carlyle Group, told CNBC that a wealth tax would not 'solve all of our society's problems' and raised questions about its practicality. Also appearing on CNBC, billionaire investor Leon Cooperman choked up while discussing the impact a wealth tax could have on his family.
'I don't need Elizabeth Warren, or the government, giving away my money,' Cooperman said. '[Warren] and Bernie Sanders are presenting a lot of ideas to the public that are morally and socially bankrupt.'
Then there is perhaps the most prominent wealthy person of all likely to stand in the way of populist Democrats' proposals: Trump. Asked about the wealth tax, a White House spokesman declined to comment directly on the proposal but said in an email, 'President Trump has been very clear: America will never be a socialist country.'
But there are signs that the pushback is having little impact on nixing the idea in Democrats' minds. Rep. Brendan Boyle (D-Pa.), who has endorsed former vice president Joe Biden for the Democratic nomination, told The Post he is crafting a new wealth-tax proposal to introduce in the House. Boyle's involvement suggests that the idea has broader political support among Democrats than previously thought.
Warren's campaign has created a tax calculator that shows how much money multimillionaires would pay under her plan. The initial wealth tax proposed by Warren would raise close to $3-trillion over 10 years " enough money to fund universal child care, make public colleges and universities tuition-free, and forgive most of the student debt held in the United States, according to some nonpartisan estimates.
The country has long had rich people, but economists say the current scale of inequality may be without precedent. The number of U.S. billionaires swelled to 749 in 2018, a nearly 5-percent jump, and they now hold close to $4-trillion collectively.
'The hyper-concentration of wealth within the top 0.1-percent is a mortal threat to the American economy and way of life,' Boyle said in an interview. 'If you work hard and play by the rules, then you should be able to get ahead. But the recent and unprecedented shift of resources to billionaires threatens this. A wealth tax on billionaires is fair and, indeed, necessary.'
But conservatives and even many Democrats have raised objections to the wealth tax, arguing that it could be skirted easily and may have limited political appeal. Microsoft's Gates, famous for his philanthropic efforts, joked to the New York Times that such a tax could erase his entire fortune. Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) and Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.) last week proposed a surtax on couples earning more than $2-million a year to address what they framed as unfairness in the tax code exacerbated by the Republican tax cuts, while stopping short of the starker wealth tax.
In an email, Bloomberg adviser Howard Wolfson denied that the prospect of paying the wealth tax factors into the former mayor's interest in running for president: 'Mike's not worried about what would happen if Elizabeth Warren won. He's worried about what would happen if Donald Trump won.'
Still, the ultrarich have taken notice of the threat, according to interviews with a half-dozen financial planners and wealth managers.
Kathryn Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, whose membership includes many of the country's biggest financial firms, said members of the business community are 'agonizing' over the prospect of having to choose between Warren and Trump in the general election.
'A lot of people in the Wall Street crowd still think the world is top-down,' Wylde said. 'They think the people at the top of the pecking order are still making the decisions or driving the debate, as opposed to the new reality of grass-roots mobilization. They don't realize the way pushback to their criticism goes viral.'
Lance Drucker, president and CEO of Drucker Wealth Management, said he has heard alarm from many of his millionaire clients over plans like Warren's to implement a wealth tax on fortunes worth more than $50-million.
'Honestly, it's only been the last month when people started getting worried,' Drucker said in an October interview. 'These tax proposals are scaring the bejesus out of people who have accumulated a lot of wealth.'
Some financial planners are urging wealthy clients to transfer millions to their offspring now, before Democrats again raise estate taxes. Attorneys have begun looking at whether a divorce could help the super-rich avoid the wealth tax. And some wealthy people are asking whether they should consider renouncing their U.S. citizenship and moving to Europe or elsewhere ahead of Democrats' potential tax increases.
'You're hearing it already,' said Jonathan Lachowitz, a financial planner at White Lighthouse Investment Management, who said he has heard discussions about leaving the country and renouncing citizenship or other legal tax-planning moves because of Democrats' tax plans from several multimillionaires. 'As the frustration mounts and tax burdens rise, people will consider it, just the way you have New Yorkers moving to Florida.'

Biden’s Iraq war walk-back is revisionist nonsense

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Former vice president Joe Biden said in a recent interview he agrees with Jim Mattis that the Obama administration’s decision to withdraw troops from Iraq was a mistake, but that as vice president he tried to keep “a residual force” stationed there. This is revisionist nonsense.
Just a few months ago, at the July Democratic presidential debate, Biden boasted that “one of the proudest moments of my life was to stand there in Al-Faw Palace and tell everyone that ... all our combat troops are coming home.” In September, he declared, “We were right to get the combat troops out.” But now he agrees it was a mistake?
The fact is, at the time Biden expressed zero regrets about the complete U.S. withdrawal, which he was in charge of executing. The New York Times reports that in December 2011 Biden was “ebullient” as he presided over the departure ceremony for the last American forces, calling President Barack Obama from Baghdad to tell him “All I’ve said about this job, I take it back. Thank you for giving me the chance to end this goddamn war.”
Of course, he did not actually end the “goddamn war,” he unleashed a humanitarian and national security catastrophe. Biden’s withdrawal created a vacuum that allowed the Islamic State — which had been reduced to just 700 fighters — to regroup, reconstitute itself and build a murderous caliphate the size of Great Britain. The terrorists enslaved and raped thousands of Yazidi girls and carried out gruesome executions across Iraq and Syria. And they spread their murderous tentacles across the globe, carrying out 143 attacks in 29 countries that killed over 2,000 people and injured many thousands more.
Biden has criticized President Trump for withdrawing from Syria against the advice of our military commanders. Yet Biden did not listen to our military commanders when it came to the Iraq withdrawal. The Times reports that Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, the U.S. commander in Iraq, proposed keeping as many as 24,000 troops in Iraq. According to Biden national security adviser Colin H. Kahl, Austin was told by the White House “you’ve got to be kidding.” So Austin presented Obama and Biden with options for 19,000, 16,000 and 10,000 troops — and told them the lowest number was “unwise.” But Biden “aggressively pushed for a smaller force,” and Obama agreed. Then, during negotiations with the Iraqis, the administration cut the offer in half to just 5,000 — an offer the Iraqis rejected.
In his interview with the Wall Street Journal, Biden blamed George W. Bush for the U.S. withdrawal, noting that he had negotiated a status of forces agreement that required an end to the U.S. military presence by 2011. Please. Does anyone really believe that if Bush were still in office in 2011, he would have pulled out all U.S. forces? Of course not.
The reason Obama and Biden were unable to get an agreement to extend the U.S. troop presence is because they made it crystal clear to the Iraqis that America was headed for the exits. Iraqis watched as Obama and Biden rejected numbers well above 10,000, only grudgingly agreed to even that number and then cut that number to 5,000. If you were an Iraqi, would this have given you confidence in America’s long-term commitment?
Iran and its political allies inside Iraq were pressing for a U.S. withdrawal, and threatening politicians who supported extending the American military presence. For Iraqi leaders, 24,000 American troops might have been worth the political risk, and maybe even 10,000 would have been worth it. But an offer of just 5,000 troops from an administration that was determined to go to zero as quickly as possible was not. If America was leaving, and Iran was staying, why risk siding with the Americans?
In 2013, as the Islamic State was gaining steam, Biden said that he and Obama felt “happy and ... fulfilled” with the decision to withdraw from Iraq. A year later, they would be forced to send U.S. forces back to Iraq to deal with the debacle they had unleashed.
Biden supported the Iraq invasion but then opposed the Bush surge, which crushed the Islamic State and won the war. Then he supported a premature withdrawal that allowed the terrorists to regroup and was celebrating that decision as recently as four months ago — but now says he regrets it. That’s quite a record for a man running on his record of experience and judgment.

Texto completo: Study harder before adopting property tax Residents should ask of the Carol Stream mayor and village trustees they not implement a property tax at this time. Our village leadership has done an amazing job of staving off a property tax over the years and our village is one of a handful in the area that does not have a property tax and that elite status increases our property values substantially and makes our village attractive to homebuyers and businesses.
I realize capital funds are drained due to the new village hall, but we will not run out of money in our capital improvement plan until three years down the road. Also, the few projects the village has cut or delayed projects only amount to 2% of its operating budget. We can do better than that and have time to look to creative solutions to cut more expenses and increase sales tax revenue by finding more innovative ways to attract new retail business.
Back during the recession, one could feel the village working extremely hard to cut expenses. It doesn’t feel we have put as much effort into doing that again now in 2019. Once a property tax is implemented, it never goes away and can continued to be increased in the future. Since we are not in such dire straits and don’t have an immediate cash need, let’s hold off on finalizing a property tax at this time.
Since 2012, the Carol Stream operating budget is up millions of dollars or 37% and staffing is up by 20-plus people or 16%. Again, let’s do more to review the budget, find better ways to attract business and look for creative solutions to insurance and pension costs before losing that elite status of being one of the few towns that does not levy a property tax.
John Jaszka Carol Stream, Citizens have rights and responsibilities There are certain rights granted to citizens of the United States. It matters not whether they are citizens by birth or by naturalization. Some of these rights include the freedom to express yourself, like freely writing editorials to the newspapers, to worship as you wish and the freedom to pursue life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
But, with the rights of a citizen come great responsibilities. Responsibilities like supporting and defending the Constitution, participating in the democratic process. respecting and obeying federal, state and local laws and to defend the country if the need should arise.
Our times are crying out for all of us to reflect on our commitment as citizens. To reflect on what it means to share in the values of both our rights, as well as our responsibilities. And while we’re at it, we should reflect on what it means to be a patriot.
Many celebrate the New England Patriots when they win a football game, but the patriot I’m speaking of is far more than a member of a football team. Not to take anything away from the team, but can we as citizens, during this critical time in our nation’s history, stand as true patriots who vigorously support their country and are prepared to defend it against enemies or detractors?
Just a little reflection to think about from a fellow citizen.
Antonia Harlan Naperville Battle is on for soul of America A veritable pitched battle for America’s heart and soul begins now with dire consequences for popular indifference, withdrawal and widespread ignorance. Stay engaged.
Clandestine hearings with obligatory leaks, unsubstantiated rumor/innuendo, specious character assassination by gutless political trolls/vacuous charlatans colluding with unprincipled "journalists" seek to destroy this glorious experiment in self-governance. Cast aside the chaos, sophomoric behavior to drain all the swamps. It’s well past time to steam clean the fruited plain.
Against the backdrop of this non-stop charade of predictable cowardice, the only genuine American heroes rest at Arlington and every U.S. cemetery from Normandy and Belgium to Hawaii’s historic Punch Bowl. It falls to each and every one of us to provide them long-awaited transparency, redeeming truth and genuine accountability for which they willingly gave that last full measure of devotion.
William G. Parrot Elgin Supporters want Trump to defy elites Kim Freitag’s letter of Oct. 19 was a very well-written scathing attack on President Donald Trump. He was accused of shredding the Constitution, lacking social and civic graces, flirting with treason vis-a-vis Russia, enriching himself from public funds, attack on the "free" press, being a dictator, being an existential threat (whatever that means), he violates all norms and rules of expected behavior. But that is exactly why 63 million of us elected him. The old elites became corrupted by power.
These fabrications, exaggerations, outlandish predictions and outright lies were and are foisted on us 24/7 by CNN, MSNBC, New York Times, Washington Post, etc.
At this time of political chaos, the Democrats" hopes to find evidence to impeach the president were shattered when the Mueller investigation (witch hunt/hoax) came up empty, no Russian collusion.
Undaunted, the Democrats and their collaborators (dishonest media) continue their pursuit and dream of impeachment. This time: Ukrainian hoax of quid pro quo.
Before the facts were in, Speaker Pelosi declared an impeachment "inquiry."
The House Judiciary Committee under the chairmanship of Adam Schiff conducts the inquiry. From the Mueller days, Schiff distinguished himself as a congenital liar and a true party hack. He declared that the inquiry will be behind closed doors. So much for fair play and open inquiry.
Democracy dies when tyrants rise to rule and the Law becomes a footnote.
Laszlo Stephan Elmhurst Some in GOP need a civics lesson Clearly some Republican members of the House, along with the entire White House, are ignorant of some basic civics they should have learned before they were old enough to vote. Either the educational system has failed them or they are suffering from selective forgetfulness, or worse, attempting to undermine due process.
An impeachment inquiry is conducted in much the same way as a criminal investigation by the police and prosecutor’s office. It is conducted in the House of Representatives. The investigators gather pertinent information about the accused’s conduct and decide if there is an impeachable crime. The accused has no say in the matter, except in any statement made to the investigators. And the findings of the investigation are kept secret. In the end, the House votes whether to impeach and turn the matter over to the Senate for an impeachment trial.
An impeachment trial is very similar to a court trial. It is conducted in the Senate and presided over by a judge. The House presents its accusations and evidence and the accused, in this case the president, gets to put on a defense. Once both sides present their arguments, the Senate acts as a jury and votes whether to impeach or exonerate.
Storming the hearings, yammering about standing up to the impeachment inquiry, and all other inappropriate behavior, only proves the ignorance (or subterfuge) of those engaging in it and makes a stronger point about why they should not be in the position to govern this country.

Texto completo: Potential NCAA issue sidelines Buckeyes star
COLUMBUS, Ohio - No. 3 Ohio State announced Friday it will not play star defensive end Chase Young against Maryland today amid concerns he violated NCAA rules by taking a loan last year from someone he describes as a "family friend."
The surprising move was disclosed in the team's status report and depth chart for the game. Ohio State said only that Young was being held out because of a "possible NCAA issue from last year" the athletic department is "looking into." The school did not elaborate or say how long he might be out.
Young, however, took to Twitter a short time later.
"I made a mistake last year by accepting a loan from a family friend I've known since the summer before my freshman year at OSU," he wrote on his verified Twitter account Friday morning. "I repaid it in full last summer and I'm working with the University and NCAA to get back on the field as soon as possible."

PRO BASKETBALL
Warriors refute report on Curry
MINNESOTA - Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry has not been ruled out for the season, a source told Bay Area News Group Friday, refuting an earlier report that Curry is likely to miss the entire season with a broken hand.
Bleacher Report's Ric Bucher wrote Friday that "a team source says the fracture was worse than originally thought, and it's unlikely that he plays again this season." The Warriors' expectation is for Curry to be re-evaluated in February, as originally intended, and decide on next steps from there.
Curry underwent surgery last week for a broken hand he suffered in Oct. 30's loss to the Phoenix Suns.

PRO FOOTBALL
Redskins opt not to pay Williams
The Washington Redskins have elected not to pay Trent Williams the remaining $5.1 million balance on his 2019 base salary, according to two people with knowledge of the decision, which came a day after the team announced it was placing the tackle on the non-football injury list.
The team has the right to withhold the salary for players on the non-football injury list, according to NFL rules. Even so, the NFL Players Association is expected to fight the decision as Williams is likely to file a grievance with the league.
Williams ended a five-month holdout shortly before the NFL trade deadline in an attempt to accrue another season toward the end of his contract and be eligible for free agency after next season. The seven-time Pro Bowler has said he no longer wants to play for the Redskins, and he claims they misdiagnosed a cancerous growth on his head.
Patrick Mahomes will start for the Kansas City Chiefs against the Tennessee Titans on Sunday, just over two weeks after the quarterback's season was jeopardized by a dislocated kneecap.

TRACK AND FIELD
Nike to look into abuse allegations
Nike will investigate allegations of abuse by runner Mary Cain while she was a member of Alberto Salazar's training group.
Cain joined the disbanded Nike Oregon Project run by Salazar in 2013, soon after competing in the 1,500-meter final at track and field's world championships when she was 17.
Now 23, Cain tells The New York Times in a video essay that under Salazar's direction, she was told to lose weight and he created an "arbitrary number of 114 pounds." Cain says she started having suicidal thoughts and cutting herself.

MIXED MARTIAL ARTS
Arrest made in missing-girl case
A man wanted in the disappearance of UFC fighter Walt Harris' stepdaughter has been apprehended in Florida, but the whereabouts of the woman he's accused of abducting remained a mystery Friday.
Ibraheem Yazeed was arrested and booked into the Escambia County Jail early Friday. Jail records show he's being held as a fugitive after being charged in Alabama with first-degree kidnapping in the disappearance of 19-year-old Aniah Blanchard. She was last seen at a gas station in Auburn, Ala., on Oct. 23.
Blanchard, a student at Southern Union State Community College, was reported missing the next day. Her car was later found abandoned in Montgomery, more than 50 miles away.

HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL
Police to seek hazing charges
WARREN, Mich. - Three football players at a Catholic high school in suburban Detroit should face charges after an investigation found some players were subjected to hazing involving a broomstick, police said.
The investigation began last week after all-boys De La Salle Collegiate said it would forfeit a playoff game and end the football season due to hazing incidents. The school had won two consecutive state championships.
"We believe there's many victims," Bill Dwyer, the police commissioner in Warren, said Friday.
Dwyer said charging recommendations were sent to the Macomb County prosecutor against a pair of 16-year-old boys and an 18-year-old who was 17 at the time the hazing is alleged to have happened.

What planet are they on?

Texto completo: For the Monitor
The failure of moderators to ask a single question about the climate crisis during the most recent three-hour-long Democratic primary debate marks a surprising low point in what has so far been an encouraging – if not entirely satisfying – discussion of climate in the presidential primary. It was shameful. The dire circumstances we're in simply demand more from the candidates and the media covering the Democratic primary.
This glaring omission from the last debate was indeed disrespectful to the almost 80% of Democratic primary voters nationwide who say that a candidate's position on climate change is very important to them.
More recently, an October CNN/UNH poll found that climate change/the environment is the No. 1 issue, tied with health care, that is “most important to (Democratic primary voters') vote in the presidential primary.” And two new exclusive questions fielded for the League of Conservation Voters (LCV) as a part of the University of New Hampshire's Granite State Poll found that the vast majority of New Hampshire residents support a move to 100% clean energy by 2050 and that many self-identified New Hampshire Democrats and independents don't think the presidential candidates are talking about climate change enough in the 2020 campaign.
Not addressing the climate crisis at this pivotal moment for our country is dangerous.
In just the past year, the U.S. has experienced climate-change-fueled deadly wildfires, devastating flooding, the hottest month ever recorded, and a terrifying warning from the U.N. that our time left to act is rapidly running out. The current president's response? Roll back 85 environmental safeguards.
While the last debate was a punch in the gut to voters across the country who care deeply about the climate crisis, we've seen glimmers of hope for our country and planet in other arenas this year. The past year has seen climate jump to the top of 2020 voters' priority issues, and 11 of the 12 presidential candidates who participated in the fourth Democratic debate have released climate plans that match the urgency of the crisis. We welcome these ambitious plans.
That said, there is still much more to do. When I attended the New Hampshire Democratic Convention, the majority of the 12 leading presidential candidates who took the stage did not discuss their proposed solutions for addressing climate change in any depth during their short stump speeches.
We've analyzed similar events in Iowa and South Carolina where all candidates were given equal time on the same stage – the Iowa Democratic Party Hall of Fame on June 9 and the South Carolina Democratic Party Convention on June 22. Only eight of 22 speeches by leading candidates touched on the policies that candidates would implement to combat the crisis. These three events are by no means a holistic picture of the way candidates are talking about climate on the campaign trail – but long-standing Democratic Party events are obvious places to lay out campaign priorities, so it's only fair to evaluate them.
We know the candidates are well-versed on their strong plans, and in order to demonstrate they are truly making this a day-one priority, the climate crisis and solutions must be a consistent and prominent feature of the message they convey to voters.
We should be hearing about the good-paying clean energy jobs these candidates will create as part of a just transition to a 100% clean energy economy at every rally, town hall and diner drop-in. They've got the plans – which is a remarkable achievement –now it's time for the 2020 presidential candidates to prove that climate action is one of their very top priorities.
The media has a critical role to play, too, especially those in a position to moderate Democratic debates – some of the most-watched events of the primary. CNN and the New York Times have both produced laudable in-depth events and coverage in the past, but debate moderators like CNN's Anderson Cooper and Erin Burnett and the New York Times' Marc Lacey cannot think they've checked the box on the issue. Given the scale of the challenge that affects us all, every single debate, town hall, forum, etc., must include a serious discussion of candidate plans to address the climate crisis.
As the primary moves forward, we'll be watching for each candidate to explicitly state that climate action is a day one priority and an every day priority. We expect to see specific climate solutions become a core part of every single stump speech. We look forward to hearing about each candidate's meetings and events with the frontline communities most impacted by the climate crisis and those suffering disproportionately from exposure to toxic pollution – and we expect those frontline voices to be prominent in the next administration.
We owe it to ourselves and the young people fueling this movement to be bigger, bolder and more ambitious in our effort to make confronting the climate crisis a central focus of our political discourse. LCV will continue to call on the news media and every 2020 presidential candidate to consistently demonstrate the leadership this moment demands.
(Gene Karpinski is president of the League of Conservation Voters. LCV's Change the Climate 2020 program is elevating climate in the Democratic primary.

AJC CONTINUING COVERAGE STONE MOUNTAIN: City to rename street linked to KKK: Venable Street will be named after pillars of Shermantown.

Texto completo: The Stone Mountain City Council voted Thursday night to rename a street named after a family with heavy historical ties to the Ku Klux Klan.
Venable Street will be renamed "Eva Mamie Lane" to recognize Eva Jewell Greene and Mamie Ella Lane, a mother-daughter duo considered pillars of Shermantown, the historically African American community in Stone Mountain.
The council approved the renaming with five voting in favor and one abstaining. Venable Street was named for the family that used to own Stone Mountain; several members of the family were prominent members of the KKK, according to archives and records.
"It was time for a change to take place," said Lydia Shumake, the niece and cousin of Greene and Lane. She said her family members "made such an impact in the community, a lot of people didn't even realize what they did years ago."
Councilwoman Diana Roe Hollis was the sole abstaining vote. She said she would have preferred to rename two streets to honor Greene and Lane separately.
The women were known for their outreach efforts, the leadership-based organizations they founded and the charity they provided to those in need. Greene died in 2006 at age 85, and her daughter died this year at 77.
Residents and leaders in Stone Mountain -- which is now about two-thirds black -- said changing the street name is a way to shed the negative stigma that accompanies the city's history. After the vote passed, loud cheers filled the small City Council chambers.
In Stone Mountain, Lane and Greene are remembered for the outreach organizations they founded and led: The DeKalb Economic Opportunity Authority, the Stone Mountain Negro Civic League, the DeKalb Neighborhood Leadership Institute and the Georgia Citizens Coalition on Hunger.
The two women were strong community advocates and organizers. In 1963, Lane turned a building at the corner of Venable and Third streets into the House of Bethel Prayer Chapel. There, she was known for holding prayer groups every Tuesday and doing outreach ministry.
"I have not seen the community come out like this" for any other issue, Councilwoman Chakira Johnson said during the meeting Thursday, recognizing the passion of the residents.
The city will rename the entire length of Venable Street, which is less than a half-mile long in the Shermantown neighborhood. The effort to change the name has been in the works for months.
The physical street signs will be changed in about three weeks, after the street name is changed on DeKalb County's digital maps, the city said.
It's unclear exactly when the street was originally named, and whether it was named after a specific member of the Venable family. Brothers William and Samuel Venable previously owned Stone Mountain, which they used as a granite quarry.They gave the Klan permission to meet at the mountain, where the group staged a cross-burning and "rebirth" in 1915, according to Atlanta Journal-Constitution archives. When the Venables sold the property to the state in the 1950s, it was designated to become a memorial to the Confederacy.
Decades later, James Venable became the Imperial Wizard of the National Knights of the Klan for nearly 25 years -- a fact noted in his obituary that ran in The New York Times. He was also a mayor of Stone Mountain, using the nearby land for annual Klan rallies, newspaper stories stated.
Shermantown residents remember seeing the KKK march through town in the 1960s on their way to the mountain.
"Venable Street--we know the history," said Vanessia Cummings, a resident who made the initial request to rename the street. "We're not going to give that any more energy."

Texto completo: Nike has vowed to investigate claims by a former middle-distance runner who said she was subjected to physical and mental abuse while training with the sportswear giant's now-shuttered Oregon Project.
Mary Cain published an opinion piece in the New York Times on Thursday saying coaches pressured her to become "thinner and thinner," which ultimately caused her to stop menstruating, break five bones and become suicidal.
"We take the allegations extremely seriously and will launch an immediate investigation to hear from former Oregon Project athletes," the company said. "At Nike we seek to always put the athlete at the center of everything we do, and these allegations are inconsistent with our values."

The Oregon Project was created in 2001 for elite runners, serving as a base for the likes of Galen Rupp and Mo Farah. It was controversial almost from the start and came under increased scrutiny as team members alleged wrongdoing.
This fall, coach Alberto Salazar was banned four years for trafficking testosterone and other anti-doping violations. Cain joined the program in 2013 as a heralded teenager, but left in 2015.
In its statement, Nike said she had never before raised concerns and "was seeking to rejoin the Oregon Project and Alberto's team as recently as April of this year."
The program was shut down soon after the sanctions against Salazar.

Nearly two years after disgraced sports doctor Larry Nassar was sent to prison for abusing young athletes, the U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee is still wrestling with the fallout, announcing the first installment in a series of "sweeping" reforms.
USOPC executives said Friday they will give athletes more say on their board of directors and increase oversight of the national governing bodies that manage each sport.
"These reforms are a significant first step of many, in our ongoing efforts to ensure our athletes are at the heart of what we do we and who we are going forward," chief executive Sarah Hirshland said. "We have taken action and will continue to take action."

Texto completo: For as long as anyone can remember, younger officers in the New York Police Department have referred to their elders as "hairbags" -- usually behind their backs.
It's an archaic bit of slang with obscure origins. In police parlance, "the bag" means "the uniform." So some officers believe "hairbag" is a riff on a longtime officer's uniform -- so old it has become hairy -- and describes veterans who know what the police call "The Job" inside out.
Others think the phrase is an insult that comes from the practice, perhaps apocryphal, of officers using a haircut as an excuse for leaving their posts. This theory holds that sergeants used to demand a bag of hair trimmings as proof, and eventually burned-out officers who shirked work came to be known as "hairbags."
Now, generations after the word entered the police lexicon, it has emerged at the center of a court battle in Manhattan, where a federal judge has been asked to pin down its precise meaning. A fair amount of taxpayer money -- more than enough to buy haircuts for the entire patrol force -- may end up riding on the outcome.
At issue is a $ 7 million age-discrimination lawsuit brought by a decorated detective, Keith Dietrich, who had the plum assignment of guarding Mayor Bill de Blasio. He claims he was forced out of the mayor's security detail and nudged into retirement this year at age 56 because his commanders regarded him as a relic.
Central to his lawsuit against the city is the claim that his supervisor called him a "hairbag" behind his back, which Mr. Dietrich says is evidence that older officers are viewed with suspicion and disdain.
"A hairbag is an older cop, a burned-out cop, who doesn't want to do anything and doesn't care anymore," Mr. Dietrich said in an interview, adding a few expletives. He said he felt outrage when he was called one. "It was disgusting," he said. He stood tall, pointing to his spit-shined shoes and squared-away clothing, and asked: "Do I look like a hairbag?"
Mr. Dietrich's lawsuit describes a litany of petty humiliations. He was pushed off the prestigious team that guards the mayor and relegated to a security booth at City Hall. He was forced to wear the uniform, which detectives, who normally wear suits, regard as a demotion.
At times, he said, he was told to take the subway between City Hall and Gracie Mansion, the mayor's residence on the Upper East Side -- rather than traveling by police car -- which he perceived as a sign of disrespect. And he was passed over for a promotion to "first-grade detective," a coveted designation that comes with a significant pay raise, even as younger detectives were promoted.
All of this came as a surprise to Mr. Dietrich, who was more accustomed to being treated as a hero. As a young officer, he had received the department's highest medal for valor for his actions during a gunfight in a Queens parking garage in 1994. He then spent years on a narcotics squad in Queens before joining the mayor's security detail in 2014.
Mr. Dietrich's plight -- a decorated detective manning a guard booth -- got the attention of higher-ups who began asking what had happened.
One such higher-up was Thomas Galati, the department's chief of intelligence, who called Mr. Dietrich in for a career chat in 2017. It was then that Chief Galati told Mr. Dietrich the problem: Mr. Dietrich's commanding officer thought Mr. Dietrich was "a hairbag," according to the lawsuit.
Lawyers for the city have argued that the "hairbag" remark "can be deemed to indicate his superiors' assessment of the plaintiff and his work ethic, and have nothing to do with his age."
But in May, a federal judge in Manhattan, Colleen McMahon, rejected that argument, concluding instead that the comment "suggests a negative perception of plaintiff's attitude and abilities because of his age."
That decision brought the case one step closer to a trial, which would probably explore the word's origin and definition, according to Mr. Dietrich's lawyer, Marshall Bellovin.
Mr. Dietrich's lawsuit is a reminder that police slang is very much alive today. To officers these words offer a powerful language for communicating what happens on the streets or at Police Headquarters.
Some officers have theorized "hairbag" comes from the way the wool uniforms of yesteryear -- the "bag" in police slang -- would pill with age, creating a hairy, or at least fuzzy, appearance.
Another possibility is that the word traces its roots to the Fire Department, not the Police Department. A retired New York City fire chief, Howard J. Hill, explained in a recent article in Fire Engineering magazine that as far back as the 19th century, firefighters would use a haircut as an excuse to leave the firehouse, sometimes for a romantic tryst.
Mr. Hill explained that "a firefighter was required to present the officer with a lock of cut hair in a bag as proof of seeing a barber, not the love of his life; hence, the term." Those who "missed an alarm for a fire while supposedly out getting a haircut" would be labeled "a hair bag."
The word has been used in the Police Department since at least 1958, when it appeared in a glossary of "New York City Police Argot" in the department's magazine, Spring 3100. The definition was brief and neutral: "a veteran policeman."
A 1970 article in The New York Times gave the word a more positive spin, defining a hairbag as "a veteran patrol man, also a patrolman with backbone."
Over time, it appears, the word took on a negative connotation for some officers. "A bitter and burned-out complainer" is the way Edward Conlon, the author and former detective, defined it in a 1998 New Yorker article, written under a pseudonym.
In a recent memoir, a former top chief in the department, Charles Campisi, recalled hearing the phrase shortly after leaving the academy. His new training officer asked him, "I guess they told you rookies that we're all a bunch of hairbags and not to listen to us and pick up our bad habits, right?"
The phrase is not dying out. When a pair of officers set up a satirical news site about the Police Department in 2017, they called it The Hairbag Times.
Mr. Dietrich's lawyers are starting to take depositions of police officials. At a recent one, Inspector Howard Redmond, the commanding officer who was accused in the lawsuit of calling Mr. Dietrich a hairbag behind his back, pleaded ignorance.
He acknowledged having heard the word, but claimed not to know its meaning, according to Mr. Dietrich, who was present for the deposition.
That struck Mr. Dietrich as implausible. "Come on, every cop knows what a hairbag is," he said.

Texto completo: Less than two months ago, Michael R. Bloomberg told a PBS interviewer that he probably couldn't win a Democratic primary, and that entering the race as late as November would be "pretty hard."
Well, it's November now, and he seems to have changed his mind. Here's a look at what happened on the campaign trail this week.
And then there were 18?
Mr. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, filed paperwork on Friday to put his name on the ballot for the Democratic primary in Alabama.
According to his advisers, he has not definitively decided to run for president, but the paperwork was necessary to keep the possibility alive, because Friday was Alabama's filing deadline. Arkansas and New Hampshire have deadlines next week, and Team Bloomberg says it plans to meet those, too.
If Mr. Bloomberg does enter the race, it will bring the Democratic field back to 18 candidates, the largest ever. For the past week or so, it was merely tied with the 2016 Republican field.
■ Our colleague Alexander Burns broke the news of Mr. Bloomberg's possible campaign and has some more details here.
■ Here's a rundown of primary filing deadlines.
■ We're tracking the full presidential field here.
The front-runner bull's-eye is still on Warren
Mr. Bloomberg's flirtation with running is part of a larger backlash to Senator Elizabeth Warren's continuing strength in the race -- and a vote of no confidence in former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s ability to unite moderate Democrats against her.
As she has cemented herself at or near the top of the polls, Ms. Warren has drawn particular vitriol from Wall Street, where some executives have already announced that they will support Mr. Bloomberg if he runs.
In a Medium post this week, Mr. Biden cast Ms. Warren as an "elitist" who takes a "'my way or the highway' approach to politics." And Leon Cooperman, the billionaire investor who complained recently about what he called Ms. Warren's "vilification of the rich," endorsed Mr. Bloomberg.
■ Our colleague Katie Glueck has more on the conflict between Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren.
■ Representative Ayanna S. Pressley of Massachusetts endorsed Ms. Warren on Wednesday, providing her most high-profile congressional endorsement to date.
■ Our colleagues Thomas Kaplan, Aliza Aufrichtig and Derek Watkins put together a detailed visualization of how Ms. Warren intends to pay for her plans.
A debate update
Thanks to six polls released since we last wrote, Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii has qualified for the next debate (Nov. 20), and Senators Kamala Harris of California and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota have qualified for the one after that (Dec. 19).
That means 10 candidates are in for November, and six so far for December.
We also learned this week that the December debate will no longer be held at the University of California, Los Angeles, because of a dispute between the university and its largest employee union. The union has called for a boycott of speaking engagements on campus. It will instead take place at Loyola Marymount University, also in Los Angeles.
■ You can always find the latest on debate qualifications here.
Trump is still competitive in swing states
While President Trump's approval rating is very low, and he trails most of his potential Democratic challengers in national polls, he appears stronger in the states that will decide the election, according to a new set of polls from The New York Times and Siena College.
In the six closest states that went Republican in 2016, he trails Mr. Biden among registered voters, but is deadlocked with Senator Bernie Sanders and leads Ms. Warren.
■ You can read more about the polls here.
■ Speaking of battleground states, a progressive organization plans to spend $ 75 million on digital advertising to counter Mr. Trump's early spending advantage in them. Our colleague Shane Goldmacher has the story.
A Steyer aide resigned
Pat Murphy, the Iowa political director for Tom Steyer, resigned after reports that he had offered campaign contributions to local Iowa candidates if they endorsed Mr. Steyer. The campaign said no contributions had actually been made.
"Our campaign policy is clear that we will not engage in this kind of activity, or any kind of communication that could be perceived as improper," Mr. Steyer's campaign manager, Heather Hargreaves, said in a statement on Friday announcing Mr. Murphy's resignation. "Violation of this policy is not tolerated."
■ Our colleague Stephanie Saul has more details on Mr. Murphy's actions.
Sanders released an immigration plan
Mr. Sanders unveiled his immigration plan on Thursday, pledging to use executive action if Congress does not pass comprehensive legislation.
He said that on the first day of his presidency, he would reverse President Trump's immigration policies, including the denial of asylum claims and the "zero tolerance" policy that has led to family separations. He also vowed to halt all deportations "until a thorough audit of current and past practices and policies is complete."
More broadly, he called for ending deportations of people who have been in the United States for more than five years, creating a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, expanding the DACA program and making unauthorized immigration a civil, not criminal, offense.
■ Our colleague Reid J. Epstein has more details.
■ Mr. Sanders has been working hard to win over Latino voters, our colleague Jennifer Medina reports. He has raised more money than any other candidate from Latinos, and was leading among them in a recent set of New York Times/Siena College polls.
■ At a forum on Friday, Ms. Warren said she, too, was open to suspending deportations, "particularly as a way to push Congress for comprehensive immigration reform."
In other policy news:
■ Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey announced an economic justice plan centered on what he called the City 2030 Project, in which 50 or more small and medium-size cities would be chosen as regional hubs and given federal funding. The plan would also create a fund for communities hurt by policies like the 1994 crime bill; strengthen antitrust regulations and block some corporate mergers; and expand tax-privileged "opportunity zones."
■ Former Representative John Delaney of Maryland released a "Paris 2.0" proposal that would commit members of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 and create a global institute for research on technologies that might mitigate climate change.
■ Ms. Warren outlined how she would support veterans and service members, pledging to raise service members' pay, expand mental health services and eliminate the benefits backlog at federal agencies.
And finally ...
Ms. Warren has wholeheartedly embraced attacks from Wall Street, and on Thursday, she took it one step further: Her campaign released a "calculator for the billionaires."
"Some billionaires seem confused about how much they would pay under Elizabeth's Ultra-Millionaire Tax," it says. "Don't worry, now we have a calculator for that too."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

LEADING OFF
Happy Friday and welcome to Rhode Map, your daily guide to everything happening in the Ocean State. I'm Dan McGowan and I complain about cold weather just as much as I complain about warm weather. Maybe I just like complaining. Follow me on Twitter @DanMcGowan or send tips to Dan.McGowan@globe.com.
Pete Buttigieg will be the first of the top-tier Democratic presidential candidates to visit Rhode Island when he travels to Providence Sunday for two events.
The South Bend, Indiana mayor, who finds himself surging in Iowa, is expected to hold a public event at The Vets and a smaller reception at Nick's on Westminster, according to local supporters. Buttigieg's campaign declined to comment.
Buttigieg is scheduled to be in New Hampshire for much of the weekend as he tries to gain ground against US Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden , the frontrunners in that state.
His trip to Rhode Island comes weeks before Biden is planning to attend a fundraiser here.
Buttigieg has raised more money in Rhode Island than any other presidential candidate, bringing in $85,000 as of Sept. 30. Warren and Sanders have been the next-best fund-raisers in the state, while the other Democratic hopefuls trail far behind.
He counts Providence Mayor Jorge Elorza , City Council President Sabina Matos and state Senator Ryan Pearson among his supporters in Rhode Island. Former Mayor Joseph Paolino and House Majority Leader Joseph Shekarchi have also said they like Buttigieg, but they have not yet endorsed him for president.
Most of the state's top elected officials - including Governor Gina Raimondo - have avoided endorsing a candidate, in part because Rhode Island's presidential primary isn't until April 28, 2020.

Texto completo: Journalists shall not make up stuff.
Journalists shall be accurate, and if we get it wrong, must admit the mistake and correct it.
We must make news decisions without the influence of any special interest, whether that is a friend, an advertiser or a political preference.
We must disclose any conflicts, whether real or perceived.
Journalists can't donate to political candidates or organizations, can't put signs in their yards promoting someone's election, can't post on social media what they might think about a particular issue.
We can't take free stuff or use our position to get an advantage in any circumstance.
And that is only the half of what is written in our newsroom code of editorial principles.
I wrote last week about social media, which is one aspect of our ethics code. This week, I will explain more about what we do and don't do.
There is no better time to remind the public - and journalists - about these principles.
The media are under daily attack in a polarized nation, where accurate reporting is labeled as fake news and journalists are portrayed as enemies of democracy. But the media also fail at times to see our role in losing the public's trust, as in-depth reporting fights for space with viral news, where gotcha journalism stars in the 24/7 online world, and where cable and online social media commentary masquerades as unbiased news.
If you Google "journalism code of ethics," you will find various guidelines from media organizations, such as the Society of Professional Journalists and the New York Times. Our code, from our owner Tribune Publishing, may be found atOrlandoSentinel.com/ethics.
All share the common characteristics mentioned above. If I had to pick a trait that runs through all the guidelines, it is integrity. That involves being honest, acting, as the old New York Times slogan went, "Without Fear or Favor."
Our policy opens with these words: "Public service through journalism is central to our mission. Our work as journalists must always center on meeting the needs and interests of readers, viewers and listeners, and we must provide them with journalism that is trustworthy, relevant and valuable. If they have reason to doubt the credibility of our work, quality won't matter - they will go elsewhere. That is especially important in the increasingly competitive multimedia world."
I like how the Society of Professional Journalists distills its ethics code to four principles: Seek Truth and Report It, Minimize Harm, Act Independently, and Be Accountable and Transparent. Read it at spj.org/ethicscode.asp.
The Orlando Sentinel requires all people who work in our newsroom to read the policy and disclose any conflicts they might have.
For example, over the years, I have disclosed my involvement with the children's program at the Bay Street Players in Eustis, my daughter's appearance in and work on theater shows that we review, my other daughter's previous work at March of Dimes and the work that attorney John Morgan's firm did in my car accident lawsuit.
Those conflicts meant I stayed out of coverage decisions involving those topics. Since my job over time has involved where articles are displayed on the website and in print, I left decisions on those organizations and people to others in management here.
A note about opinion columnists and critics. They must follow the guidelines, but are allowed to express their thoughts in print and online in a way a reporter can't. So, if Lauren Ritchie wants to write, "Shut up and get behind the governor" in support of teacher raises, she can. (Disclosure of a possible conflict: Lauren hired me in 2002, for which I am ever grateful.)
One recurring question I get from readers is about anonymous sources. The policy states, "When a reporter proposes to use an unnamed source, his or her editor or news director should discuss the case and proceed if satisfied that the information the source provides is of compelling importance to the public interest. Reporters and their supervisors should strive first to obtain information from sources that can be identified."
Anonymous sources can't be used without permission from the managing editor or editor-in-chief, and a reason is supposed to be published about why they aren't quoted by name, with some indication of what gives them access to the information.
Washington reporting relies heavily at times on anonymous sources, but you seldom see Sentinel reporters using it. That's a meaty topic I will save for next week, because I both understand its usage and think it is overused.
If you have specific thoughts or questions about our policy, email me at the address below.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - A senior American diplomat has written a highly critical assessment of the Trump administration's abrupt withdrawal of troops from northeast Syria last month, a decision that paved the way for an attack on U.S.-allied forces in the area, officials said Thursday.
In an internal memo, William Roebuck, the top American diplomat in northern Syria, takes the Trump administration to task for not doing more to prevent Turkey's invasion or protect the Kurds, who fought alongside U.S. forces in the battle against the Islamic State group, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the matter.
One of the officials described the memo, which was obtained and first revealed by The New York Times, as "lengthy and harsh." The officials spoke on condition of anonymity.
Roebuck's memo highlights how President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw the troops was deeply divisive, even within his own administration.
The move was widely criticized by Democrats and Republicans as abandoning a key ally in the fight against the Islamic State.
Turkey invaded days after Trump ordered the U.S. special forces to leave.
In the memo quoted by the Times, Roebuck said there was no way to know if more pressure on Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, would have stopped the operation.
"It's a tough call, and the answer is probably not. But we won't know because we didn't try," the Times quoted Roebuck as writing.
Trump's ordered withdrawal from the northeast has been somewhat tempered by the deployment of forces to protect oil fields in Kurdish-held areas.

GM selling shuttered factory
in Ohio to electric truck maker
TOLEDO, Ohio - General Motors is selling a massive assembly plant it shut down earlier this year in Ohio, a closing that drew threats and scolding from President Donald Trump, to a newly formed company that said Thursday it intends to begin making electric trucks by late 2020.
The company called Lordstown Motors Corp. plans to hire 400 production workers at the outset, but said it still needs more investors before manufacturing can begin.
GM had employed 4,500 people at the factory near Youngstown just two years ago before it began cutting production and eventually in March ended more than 50 years of car manufacturing there, part of a major restructuring plan.
Terms of the sale and the investors who are behind the deal weren't disclosed by the privately held Lordstown Motors.

French leader laments NATO's 'brain death' due to US actions
BRUSSELS - French President Emmanuel Macron claimed that a lack of U.S. leadership is causing the "brain death" of the NATO military alliance, insisting in an interview published Thursday that the European Union must step up and start acting as a strategic world power.
Macron's public criticism of the state of the world's biggest military alliance was rejected by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, setting the scene for a possible showdown in London next month when NATO leaders meet.
"What we are currently experiencing is the brain death of NATO," Macron told The Economist magazine. He said the United States under President Donald Trump appears to be "turning its back on us."

North Carolina no longer an outlier on sex and consent
GREENSBORO, N.C. - North Carolina's governor has signed a sexual assault bill that says women can revoke consent during sex.
Gov. Roy Cooper said in a news release Thursday that he had signed the bill, which undoes a 1979 court decision that made North Carolina the only state where women can't revoke consent.
The law also undoes a court ruling from 2008 that said sexual assault laws don't apply to people who were incapacitated because of their own action as victims, such as by taking drugs or alcohol. It also increases penalties for child abusers.
The law goes into effect Dec. 1.
Both houses of the legislature approved the bill unanimously last week. Cooper says the bipartisan legislation "will help more people seek justice against abusers."

Woman in failure-to-protect case to be released from prison
OKLAHOMA CITY - An Oklahoma woman who has served 15 years in prison for failing to report her boyfriend, who served just two years for abusing her children, is scheduled to be released from custody.
The Oklahoma Department of Corrections says Gov. Kevin Stitt has signed the commutation sentence of Tondalao Hall and she is to be released Friday.
Her release comes about after the state Pardon and Parole Board voted unanimously to recommend that Stitt commute her sentence to time served.
Hall's ex-boyfriend, Robert Braxton, pleaded guilty to abusing the children and was released on probation after two years in jail.
The disparity of the sentences outraged women's rights groups and brought further attention to Oklahoma's high rate of incarceration, particularly of women.

Governor of Texas to open homeless camp in Austin
AUSTIN, Texas - Texas' Republican governor said Thursday that he is creating a homeless campsite on 5 acres of state land of the outskirts of downtown in the capital of Austin, escalating a battle with the city's liberal leaders over people living on the streets.
Greg Abbott's announcement was met with a mix of muted welcoming and accusations of political posturing from Democrats who run the state capital around the Texas Governor's Mansion, where Abbott has spent months lashing out at the city's homelessness problem on Twitter.
Abbott spokesman John Wittman said the campsite will have portable restrooms and hand-washing stations.
He said it will also provide access to homeless case workers and health care providers until permanent sheltering opens.

Texto completo: The indictment of two former Twitter employees accused of spying for the Saudis highlights the platform's power and the kingdom's efforts to control it.
BEIRUT, Lebanon -- In Saudi Arabia, where a relatively closed culture leaves citizens few public forums to discuss news and politics, Twitter has become a kind of town square, the place where citizens meet to swap information and debate the latest issues.
Saudi Arabia's absolute monarchy has not banned the site, but it has taken extensive measures to shape the information that appears there and to silence or drown out dissidents who use it to post critical views.
The Justice Department's indictment on Wednesday of two former Twitter employees accused of spying for Saudi Arabia cast rare light on one corner of the vast measures the kingdom has taken to shape what its citizens see when they go online.
Why is Twitter so big in Saudi Arabia?
Saudi Arabia provides no public spaces where citizens can gather to discuss news and politics. And the kingdom's news media are state-owned or controlled, limiting the range of perspectives they carry.
But many Saudi citizens have multiple cellphones and fast internet, which have led them to use Twitter to engage both with the world and with their fellow citizens.
That has given the kingdom one of the world's largest Twitterspheres.
According to one recent report, Saudi Arabia had 9.9 million active Twitter users, the fourth highest in the world, behind the United States, Britain and Japan. But in terms of the percentage of the population using the platform, Saudi Arabia was first, with 37 percent of residents doing so, compared with 18 percent in the United States.
It can seem like everyone in Saudi Arabia is on Twitter: prominent Muslim clerics, well-known journalists, TV stars and even the 83-year-old monarch, King Salman, who has 7.8 million followers.
Jamal Khashoggi, the dissident Saudi writer who was killed by Saudi agents in Istanbul last year, had 1.6 million followers at the time of his death, allowing him to broadcast his views even after he'd been banned from Saudi news outlets. His direct line to fellow Saudis, which the kingdom was powerless to stop, may well have contributed to his death.
The platform's importance has made it a key battleground for the government, which uses it to tout the kingdom's policies, and a range of dissidents at home and abroad who use it to spread criticism of government policies and campaign for the release of political detainees.
How does the Saudi government handle Twitter?
Unlike other authoritarian governments in, say, Iran or China, Saudi Arabia has not blocked access to Twitter, perhaps considering it a useful, and relatively harmless, pressure valve for society. Instead, critics and researchers say, it has invested in a range of techniques to influence what Saudis see when they use the platform.
These include hard tactics like arresting or putting on trial prominent Twitter personalities who criticize the government and softer efforts like promoting positive tweets and working to sideline negative ones.
"They can't really block out these websites from the server side, so they have to contest the space," said Alexei Abrahams, a research fellow at the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto. "If they pour enough resources in, then maybe social media becomes more useful to the regime than to the opposition. I'm not sure we've crossed that threshold yet, but we can't be that far from it."
To shape the online environment, the Saudi government has marshaled armies of accounts to promote pro-government content and attack critical voices, Mr. Abrahams said. These can be automated accounts, known as bots, or accounts run by people working for the Saudi government who use Twitter in a coordinated fashion, according to an investigation published by The New York Times last year.
Acting together, they can promote accounts or hashtags that, say, praise the kingdom's leadership while diluting the presence of critical conversations. That can end up shaping what average Saudis find when they go online.
"You can make it appear that the weight of public opinion lies with the regime," Mr. Abrahams said.
How do Saudi dissidents use Twitter?
Saudi dissidents, many of them abroad, use Twitter to broadcast their views to their countrymen inside the kingdom. They include human rights activists who track detentions, and dissidents like Omar Abdulaziz, who lives in Canada and who posts frequent videos of himself commenting on current events and criticizing Saudi policies.
The Saudi government has tried to shut down these accounts. Mr. Abdulaziz says that his brothers in Saudi Arabia have been detained to pressure him to be quiet and that the Royal Court sent envoys to Canada to try to persuade him to come home and work for the government. He has refused.
The kingdom has also gone after the administrators of anonymous accounts, and it appears that this is why it may have sought to recruit spies inside Twitter.
Ali Alzabarah, one of the men indicted this week, was an engineer who had access to users' personal information. Another, Ahmad Abouammo, could see users' email addresses and phone numbers, sensitive information that could help the government unmask the people behind anonymous accounts.
Both men left Twitter in 2015, and no further efforts by the kingdom to infiltrate social media companies have been uncovered.
The killing of Mr. Khashoggi, a columnist for The Washington Post who criticized the kingdom's leadership, drew international attention to Saudi efforts to silence dissidents.
It appears that the kingdom is still working in cyberspace to promote its views.
"There are still tons of bots out there," said Mr. Abrahams, the researcher.

PRESCRIPTION FOR A PIE PITT ALUM AND HIS HUSBAND FEATURE CREATIVE RECIPES IN 'NEW PIE'

Texto completo: For two scientists, a love of baking has not only led to a marriage but also winning ribbons at competitions across the country and a cookbook with showstopping pies.
Chris Taylor, who grew up in Johnstown and spent 10 years in Pittsburgh for college and graduate school, was wrapping up his doctorate at the University of Pittsburgh when a mutual friend introduced him to his now husband, Paul Arguin, who was was working at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.
They had their first date - over the phone - baking a complicated Scarlet Empress (a sponge cake that is spread with raspberry preserves, rolled into a jelly roll, sliced and placed in a bombe mold with Bavarian custard, unmolded, and sliced into wedges and served as cake) from "The Cake Bible" by Rose Levy Beranbaum. Mr. Arguin baked a cake in Atlanta and Mr. Taylor another in Pittsburgh.
They baked that propitious cake 10 years ago. Five years ago, on the anniversary of the cake date, they were married. Mr. Taylor moved to Atlanta to work at the CDC on Alzheimer's and older adult health. Mr. Arguin recently retired from the health protection agency as the nation's' chief malaria physician but jokes that he can simply be referred to as a cookbook author.
That's because the couple are proud authors of "The New Pie: Modern Techniques for the Classic American Dessert." They will stop by Riverstone Books in McCandless on Nov. 21 from 7 to 8 p.m. for a meet-and-greet.
Both men learned baking at a young age from their moms, and both said they came into their own as bakers during young adulthood. For two consecutive years during graduate school, Mr. Taylor set himself a New Year's resolution of baking something new every week.
When they were dating, the two began entering contests at fairs with cakes, cookies, pies and candies. During one of Mr. Taylor's early years in Atlanta, the men entered a pie-baking contest in the North Atlanta suburbs. He baked a sweet pie and Mr. Arguin a savory one. Mr. Taylor won a blue ribbon.
In 2017, they entered the National Pie Championship in Orlando, Fla., and Mr. Taylor won best in show in the amateur division with a Peanut Butter Checkerboard Pie that has a checkerboard design on top and throughout the filling.
When the American Pie Council sent out a press release about the winners after the pie contest, The New York Times ran a story about the couple's baking career. Shortly after the couple began getting calls from publishers and literary agents. They signed a contract with Clarkson Potter, a division of Penguin Random House, and were asked to generate a cookbook in six months.
"We had a lot of early mornings and late nights," Mr. Arguin said.
Thankfully, they had kept good records from all their contests, so they had some recipes at the ready. But as scientists, they believe in precision and so retested each one, tweaking for exactness.
"The New Pie: Modern Techniques for the Classic American Dessert" came out in March with 75 recipes.
The men see their book as different from others in several ways. They weigh ingredients rather than measuring. Mr. Taylor says this means they "reliably turn out a beautiful pie crust every time" in any city or kitchen.
They include tips on how to make a pie pretty, a skill they learned to win competitions. And they're serious about using "modern" in their subtitle. For instance, they use the sous vide style of cooking in some of their fruit pies.
Mint chocolate chip, bubble gum, root beer, banana blueberry are among the unique pie flavors in the book and there are recipes based on cocktails such as mango colada, Old-Fashioned and Manhattan. A favorite of theirs is pie that sounds like it should be savory, but in fact is sweet. Cheese Course pie is built with a walnut and graham cracker crust, fig jam made with port wine, and a Gorgonzola dulce cheese.
Mr. Taylor tips his hat to his years spent in the city with the Pittsburgh Proud pie and it is a riff on a Pittsburgh standard - french fries on top of everything. He created the pie with a black cocoa crust, filled it with a chocolate cream layer using porter beer and malted milk powder, and topped it off with chocolate-covered potato sticks. He said serious Pittsburghers can top it with a bit of edible gold leaf for a true black-and-gold effect.
["For an authentic treat, make this black-and-gold pie with Dark Brewed Porter from Pittsburgh-based Yuengling brewing company," says recipe's head note. But Yuengling is headquartered in Pottsville and not Pittsburgh.]
Is there another cookbook in their future? Perhaps.
Mr. Arguin said the pair enjoyed writing their debut book.
"We learned a lot from cookbooks because we're not culinarily trained," Mr. Taylor added. "It's good to be able to contribute to the history of cookbooks with our own."

Texto completo: As two countries grieved the ambush killings of six children and their mothers, Mexico's president set up a special commission to find the killer or killers.
More than 200 shell casings were found at the scene of Monday's attack near the Sonora-Chihuahua border, commission member Marcelo Ebrard said Wednesday.
Secretary of Security Alfonso Durazo said shell casings at the scene came from a weapon made in the U.S.
But the discoveries haven't gotten officials any closer to arresting whoever killed three mothers and six of their children in the grisly attack.
Army chief of staff Gen. Homero Mendoza said Wednesday that authorities were focusing their investigation on the possibility that it was related to a conflict between two criminal groups fighting for control of a region in northern Mexico.
Gen. Mendoza said that before the family was attacked on Monday, the groups had a shootout in the town of Agua Prieta, on the border with the United States. At least one person died and another was wounded.
The authorities identified the groups as Los Salazar, based in the state of Sonora, and La Linea, based in the neighboring state of Chihuahua. After the gang shootout Monday morning, they said, La Linea dispatched gunmen to a region that straddles the two states to try to prevent their rivals from entering Chihuahua.
For his part, Chihuahua Attorney General Cesar Peniche Espejel said he believes the newly formed Los Jaguares cartel, an offshoot of the infamous Sinaloa drug cartel, may be behind the massacre. But a U.S. official confirmed that La Linea is under scrutiny.
The attack on the Mormons as they drove through Sonora, toward the border with Chihuahua, Gen. Mendoza said, is being attributed to this clash between the rival gangs. It remained unclear, however, whether the family was somehow involved in the rivalry or whether the attack was a case of mistaken identity.
The three mothers drove together in a convoy for added protection, family members said.
"All of a sudden, bullets just rained from above, from on top of a hill, down on top of them," said Lafe Langford, a relative of the victims.
"The mothers were dead. There were seven wounded children that were alive."
The nine killed had dual U.S.-Mexican citizenship and were members of a Mormon community that appeared to be fundamentalist. The community is separate from the mainstream Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
With all three mothers killed at the scene, the children who survived the massacre had to fend for themselves.
Devin Blake Langford, 13, watched his mother and two brothers die.
"What Devin has told us is that one of the three vehicles was shot up and then set ablaze," Lafe Langford said.
Devin hid six of his siblings in bushes and covered them with branches to "keep them safe while he sought help," another relative, Kendra Lee Miller, wrote on Facebook.
From the hiding place, the boy trekked about 14 miles across country to the outpost of La Mora, where the families lived, to get help. He arrived shortly before sunset, providing the first reports about survivors and how the deadly attack had unfolded.
As nightfall loomed, 9-year-old McKenzie Langford - who was shot in the wrist - grew worried about Devin and said, "I gotta go find him," Lafe Langford said.
"She had a bullet through her wrist, but nevertheless, she was probably in the best shape to walk at that point. And so away she went," Mr. Langford said.
"And we found her by her little footprints. She took the wrong road. Six hours later, and we saw that her footprints had a shoe, and then a bare little foot because she had to take her shoes off and her feet were just swollen and covered in blisters when they found her at 9:30 at night."
But McKenzie didn't complain about her injuries.
"The first thing that came out of her mouth when she saw her uncles was, 'We have to go back. We have to go back. My siblings, my brothers and sisters are dying. They're bleeding, they're shot. We have to go rescue them,' " Mr. Langford said. "And that's all she cared about."
Five children who were hospitalized in Tucson will survive, Willie Jessop, whose son married Dawna Langford's daughter, told CNN. Three of the children have very serious injuries but the two others could be discharged soon, Mr. Jessop said. Dawna Langford was one of the three mothers killed in the ambush.
Ms. Miller, who lost her sister-in-law in the attack, said "cartels have taken too many of our family members."
She said cartels had recently threatened her family over where it can travel.
"They had stood up to the drug cartels, and they did have certain frictions either with the cartels or with neighboring communities over water rights," former Mexican Foreign Minister Jorge Castañeda said.
The New York Times, The Washington Post, Bloomberg News and The Associated Press contributed.

Texto completo: AVIATION
Cabin crew strike grounds Lufthansa flights
Lufthansa cancelled about 1,300 flights on Thursday and Friday because of a planned strike by a union representing cabin crew in Germany. The UFO union has called members out on a 48-hour strike as part of a bitter dispute with Germany's biggest airline about pay and the union's legal status. Lufthansa said Wednesday it is putting together a special flight plan and passengers will be able to check their flight's status on its website. It said that it would be able to operate 2,300 of Thursday's 3,000 planned flights and 2,400 of those planned for Friday. Around 180,000 passengers will be affected by cancellations. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
WORKPLACE
Productivity down for first time in four years
American workers were less efficient in the July-September quarter, pushing down productivity for the first time since late 2015. The Labor Department said Wednesday that productivity, a measure of economic output for each hour worked, fell 0.3 percent in the third quarter. The drop comes after two quarters of healthy gains. The Trump administration promoted its 2017 corporate tax cut as a policy that would raise productivity by encouraging businesses to invest in more computers, machinery, and other equipment. Productivity did pick up in the first half of this year after growing modestly in 2018, but it now appears to be dropping back to the slow growth that has occurred since the Great Recession ended. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
APPAREL
The queen's new clothes will be adorned with fake fur
Buckingham Palace says new outfits designed for Queen Elizabeth II will not use real fur. The palace said Wednesday the decision does not mean the queen will dispose of all the fur outfits she has. The palace statement says "the queen will continue to rewear existing outfits in her wardrobe." The decision pleased animal rights activists, who have sometimes criticized the monarch for the fur pieces in her collection of designer clothes. Claire Bass, director of the Humane Society International/UK, says "we are thrilled Her Majesty has officially gone fur-free." She says the queen's decision will send a positive message that fur is no longer considered fashionable. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
MEDIA
New York Times added 273,000 digital subscribers in quarter
Readers continue to shower The New York Times with money. Advertisers, not so much. The publisher added 273,000 online subscribers in the third quarter, for a total of 4 million digital readers, the company reported Wednesday. The number of total subscribers, including print and digital, hit 4.9 million, a high. Advertising was the weak spot, falling 6.7 percent overall, with digital ad revenue dropping 5.4 percent. The decline in print advertising was not unusual, as readers continue to prefer getting their news on screens. The drop in digital ads, however, was more surprising for The Times, an established publisher with a growing base of online readers. The company also revealed for the first time the size of its international readership: 500,000 digital subscribers, mostly from Britain, Canada, and Australia. The company said it was still on a pace to reach its previously stated goal of having 10 million total paying readers by 2025, with “at least 2 million" coming from outside the United States. In December, the company expects to buy back its headquarters building, at 620 Eighth Ave. in Manhattan, for $245 million. — NEW YORK TIMES
PHARMACIES
CVS revenue soars after buying insurer
CVS Health revenue surged more than 36 percent in the third quarter, nearly a year after acquiring one of the nation's largest health insurers. The drugstore chain and pharmacy benefit manager also said Wednesday that it filled more prescriptions as net income climbed 10 percent to $1.53 billion in a performance that topped analyst expectations. The Woonsocket, R.I., company runs about 9,900 retail locations and processes over a billion prescriptions annually as a pharmacy benefit manager. Late last November, it added health insurance for more than 22 million people when it completed a roughly $69 billion acquisition of Aetna. That deal helped push revenue to $64.81 billion, while adjusted earnings totaled $1.84 per share in the quarter.
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
Xerox lines up financing in potential bid for HP
Xerox Holdings Corp. has come up with financing from Citigroup Inc. as it weighs a potential bid for HP Inc., according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Xerox is considering making a cash-and-stock offer for HP, said the person, who asked to not be identified because the deliberations are private. Xerox chief executive John Visentin would run the combined company under the proposal being discussed, the person said. Xerox sees room for about $2 billion of annual cost savings from combining the two companies, the person said. — BLOOMBERG
TECHNOLOGY
Apple expands privacy website
Apple is expanding its website on privacy with more explanations about its commitments, though its policies and practices aren't changing. The new site Wednesday is part of Apple's ongoing push to distinguish itself from data-hungry, advertising-fueled rivals such as Google and Facebook. Apple's privacy website is mostly a users' guide with papers on how to prevent apps and other third-party services from unnecessarily tracking users' location and behaviors. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
FAST FOOD
Papa John's rebounds, with an assist from Shaq
Shaquille O'Neal's new ads for Papa John's promise a brighter day at the struggling company. At the very least, it was a brighter third quarter. The Louisville-Based pizza chain said its North American same-store sales grew for the first time in two years in the July-September period. Sales at locations open at least a year — a key metric of a retailer's health — were up 1 percent. Papa John's announced in March that O'Neal would serve as a pitchman. The move was part of a larger effort to repair the damage after the company's founder and namesake, John Schnatter, made racially insensitive remarks. Schnatter resigned as CEO and chairman in 2018. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
ONLINE DATING
Match stock falls after missed forecasts
Romance may still be in the air, but on the balance sheet, things are not quite matching up for one of the online dating industry's top sites. Shares for Match Group Inc. plummeted after it gave quarterly forecasts that missed Wall Street estimates, due to mounting legal costs and economic factors that are denting sales growth. The shares slumped the most in a year. The Dallas-based company said fourth-quarter revenue will be $545 million to $555 million. Wall Street was expecting $560 million. In 2018, the company spent about $15 million on legal costs. This year, legal bills have climbed to around $40 million. Match is involved with three high-profile lawsuits. The company is suing rival dating app Bumble over allegedly stealing intellectual property from its star performer, Tinder. At the same time, Tinder's founders are suing Match for allegedly misleading them about the app's valuation. And last month, the Federal Trade Commission sued Match, accusing it of deceiving consumers by using messages from fraudulent accounts to encourage users to sign up for subscriptions. — BLOOMBERG

Texto completo: Should you see “The Irishman" in a movie theater?
Short answer: of course you should.
Is it a shame that almost everyone will watch it at home on Netflix? Sure. But without Netflix “The Irishman" wouldn't exist.
Welcome to the state of the movie industry in 2019, when what may very well be the year's best film was essentially made for TV. This development comes at a time of loud arguments, both within and outside the industry, over how long a movie should play in theaters before becoming available elsewhere, how much we need to know about a movie's success, and what even constitutes a movie in the first place. There are winners and losers in this fight, but they're not necessarily the obvious ones.
“The Irishman" seems tailor made for the biggest screen you can find. It's a 3½-hour gangster epic from Martin Scorsese that stars Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and — as former Teamsters leader and notable missing person Jimmy Hoffa — Al Pacino. It premiered at the New York Film Festival in September to general hosannas and is currently playing a limited engagement at Broadway's Belasco Theater in New York and in Los Angeles. (The film opens here Nov. 15; the Globe's review will run then.)
How “The Irishman" came to be a Netflix film says much about the modern movie business. Because of its length and $160 million budget (all that period detail costs money, as did the computerized "de-aging" needed to make De Niro look younger in the early scenes), Scorsese's usual studio, Paramount, took a pass on the project. Streaming service Netflix, having successfully dipped its toe in the Oscar-season waters with last year's “Roma," gave the legendary filmmaker the green light. And that's when the dogfights began.
Major movie theater chains like AMC and Regal despise video-on-demand in general and Netflix in particular for eating away at their business; historically, any distributor planning to take a movie to the streaming market within 72 days of its theatrical release has been boycotted by the chains with extreme prejudice.
But a new Scorsese gangster movie? “The Departed" grossed nearly $300 million worldwide in 2006, not a sum the theatrical chains are willing to walk away from, even if a 209-minute running time would mean fewer showings and fewer tickets sold. The director himself was pushing for “The Irishman" to get maximum theatrical exposure, and two major chains, AMC and Cineplex, sat down at a negotiating table with Netflix in August to hammer out a deal.
They failed. The chains reportedly were willing to decrease the VOD window gap to 60 days, but Netflix representatives insisted on 45 days or nothing. The streaming company walked away from the table and announced that “The Irishman" would debut on Netflix Nov. 27, less than a month after its theatrical premiere. Without the chains at its disposal, the film will play independent theaters and art houses; it will screen here at the Kendall Square and the Coolidge Corner.
The response from Hollywood's old guard has been apoplectic, with John Fithian, head of the National Association of Theater Owners trade association, calling Netflix's move “a disgrace." And it does seem a little perverse. What entertainment corporation in its right capitalistic mind forgoes millions in theatrical revenue? It's almost . . . anti-money.
It's really just anti-movie ticket. Netflix is a subscription-based service, and the business model is all about keeping 158 million subscribers happy for their $12.99 a month. That regular cash pipeline does several things. It puts every movie (and TV show) on a level playing field, with art house fare and B-movies theoretically equal to the biggest blockbusters. And it serves to neutralize the need for audience metrics like theatrical box office and viewership numbers for individual titles, neither of which Netflix makes public. When you're being paid for all your content, who cares how the individual pieces are faring?
This is further sand in the machinery of the traditional film industry, which for decades has relied on such statistics to do business — to assign monetary value to projects and people and to decide what movies or shows get made or which ones are too risky. According to a source with knowledge of the company's strategies, the Netflix philosophy is “We want our movies to be watched and judged for what they are and it's not about keeping score." This may or may not be just paying lip service, but in a deeply hidebound company town, it's heresy.
Not at all coincidentally, the director of “The Irishman" has been openly talking about risk, expanding in a New York Times opinion piece on his recent comments regarding Marvel movies and art. “Many films today are perfect products manufactured for immediate consumption," Scorsese wrote. “Many of them are well made by teams of talented individuals. All the same, they lack something essential to cinema: the unifying vision of an individual artist. Because, of course, the individual artist is the riskiest factor of all."
Like it or not, Netflix is bankrolling and/or distributing some of the year's riskiest movies. Not just “The Irishman," but Noah Baumbach's upcoming “Marriage Story," with Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver as a couple splitting up, and the Eddie Murphy comeback vehicle “My Name Is Dolemite.“ There's also "The King," an expansive Henry V epic, featuring Timothée Chalamet, Steven Soderbergh's “The Laundromat," and Cannes Grand Jury winner “Atlantics." “Dolemite" didn't open in Boston theaters, but in some cases, on-demand exposure may actually prompt a wider theatrical release. According to the source mentioned above, the longer that “Roma" played on Netflix during last year's Oscar race, the more calls came in from regional movie houses inquiring about booking the film.
One thing is clear: The big theater chains still don't get it. People will watch movies where they watch them, and if they don't want to see a movie in theaters they won't, regardless of whether it's available elsewhere. Even a 2018 study funded by Fithian's NATO concluded that video on demand not only doesn't cannibalize theatrical box office but may actually complement it — that heavy streamers, it turns out, are also faithful moviegoers. If AMC and Cineplex had acceded to Netflix's demand for a short 45-day on-demand window, “The Irishman" would be on more big screens where it belongs, the theaters would be making money, and everyone would be happy — moviegoers, Netflix subscribers, and Marty.
Instead, the chains ignored a future that has already become the present. Maybe a best picture Oscar will finally get them to see that.

Reaching for nouns, he said that al-Baghdadi died “like a dog.”
I wasn’t aware that canines expired in a signature fashion, but Trump knows best, even if he doesn’t know so very many words. About a week later, when he took characteristically nasty note of Beto O’Rourke’s decision to abandon the presidential race, he said that O’Rourke quit “like a dog.”
Some similes demand repetition.
This wasn’t one of them.
But a lack of verbal ingenuity never stopped Trump. And an animus toward a certain animal has long, well, hounded him.
In his boundless unoriginality, he has likened women he dislikes to dogs. In his infinite incoherence, he has repeatedly tweeted of people being fired like dogs. I personally haven’t met all that many gainfully employed pooches, unless digging holes in the backyard is a profession, and when those excavators received orders to desist, none of them got a pink slip and a referral to career counseling.
Trump did recently make the acquaintance — from a distance — of a dog with a bona fide job. He’s a Belgian Malinois named Conan. And his job, brilliantly executed, was to find, chase and corner al-Baghdadi. Trump called Conan “a beautiful dog, a talented dog,” making him so famous that The New York Post put his picture on its front page, along with the headline “Zero Bark Thirty.” Trump also tweeted a Photoshopped image in which he draped a medal around Conan’s neck.
So this Malinois warrants decoration while “a dog” gets derision? Or is it just that every dog has its day? I used to believe that adage until Trump came along. He has had more than 1,000 days in the presidency, even as the White House goes to the dogs.
Journalists with many news organizations (The Washington Post, New York magazine, Slate and more) have had a field day with Trump’s dogged use of “dog” as an all-purpose put-down. When it comes to “like a dog,” he’s like a dog with a bone.
You’re no one until he’s divined the flea-bitten mongrel within you — and you’ve joined a dog pound that includes the likes of Mitt Romney, Gen. Stanley McChrystal, Bill Maher, Steve Bannon, George Will, Omarosa Manigault Newman, my fellow Times columnist Gail Collins and many more.
Fun doggy factoids cling to him like so much Samoyed fur. He’s the first president in more than a century who doesn’t have a dog. According to the Chinese zodiac, he was born in the year of the dog. According to Ivana Trump, he provoked growls from her dog, Chappy, a poodle who could suss out a peacock. The media’s nickname for his first defense secretary, James Mattis, was “mad dog.” And from the forehead up, he’s a dead ringer for a distressed Pomeranian.
But no one has definitively solved the riddle of what seems like a rabid case of canine contempt. I have my own theories, but first I have the more erudite insights of Justin Frank, a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst and the author of the book “Trump on the Couch.”
Frank noted that Trump is “phobic about germs” and no doubt sees dogs as four-legged germ factories. He probably also thinks “dogs are stupid because they obey,” Frank said. Disobedience is Trump’s preferred posture, at least for himself, although he broke with that to become, in Frank’s words, “Putin’s lap dog.” Disobedience, that is, and distemper.
Frank raised another issue that the president might well have with dogs: When they’re around, they often steal attention, becoming the objects of people’s oohing and cooing. Trump likes the oohing all to himself.
My own sense? For Trump, all relationships are transactional and God’s creatures possess value only in accordance with their ability to elevate and enrich him. His affection for Kellyanne Conway hinges on her superhuman power not to break into laughter or spontaneously combust when she puts the most ludicrously adulatory spin on his most transparently execrable deeds. If border collies performed that trick, he would keep a kennel of them at Mar-a-Loco.
His regard for Rudy Giuliani depends on the hunched henchman’s openness to unscrupulous errands. If Doberman pinschers could pressure Ukrainian officials to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden, Trump would repurpose Camp David as a dog run and turn Ivanka’s pumps into chew toys.
But they can’t, just as Siberian huskies can’t hack Democrats’ emails — for that, a husky Siberian is handier — and golden retrievers can’t retrieve gold. Dogs are useless to Trump, at least by the criteria he cares about.
There’s no money in most of them, no votes in any of them, and they can’t play golf with him and tell him along the way what a manly drive and graceful putt he has. That’s lucky for Lindsey Graham, who would otherwise be swapped out for a Labradoodle lickety-split.
Conan passed muster only because for a moment in time, he was a proxy for Trump’s own imagined machismo. Maybe Chappy was merely yappy. Like a Donald.

Texto completo: John Leguizamo ha pasado el año haciendo algo que muchos calificarían como un acto desafiante: viajar a lo largo de Estados Unidos con un monólogo que reivindica el papel de los latinos en la historia de EE.UU.
Es de asumir que el público que paga una entrada para ver 95 minutos de su espectáculo admira al actor, pero no siempre ha sido así.
* ¿Hablas español? Sigue toda nuestra cobertura aquí
“Ocasionalmente hay una pareja, que suele ser blanca y un poco mayor en edad, que empieza a molestarse mientras ve el show. Y creen que es su derecho decirme que me devuelva a México o alguna locura así…”, le dijo Leguizamo a BBC Mundo en una conversación reciente en Los Ángeles.
“Por cierto, no soy de México… “, añade con picardía el intérprete de 55 años, que nació en Bogotá y llegó a vivir a la ciudad de Nueva York con apenas 4 años de edad.
Facebook Latin History For MoronsLeguizamo se hace pasar por maestro de escuela en su monólogo “Historia latina para tontos”.
El monólogo, que en 2018 recibió un reconocimiento especial en los Premios Tony de lo mejor del teatro de EE.UU., se titula Latin History for Morons, o “Historia latina para tontos”.
En él, Leguizamo se hace pasar por un maestro de escuela que enseña los episodios de la historia que “no aparecen en los libros escolares”.
La sátira del intérprete aborda, entre otras cosas, la “exterminación” por parte de los colonizadores de los imperios maya y azteca y de los indígenas taínos.
* ¿Cómo sería México si Estados Unidos no se hubiera apropiado de más de la mitad de su territorio en el siglo XIX?
En otro momento, destaca también el papel de latinoamericanos e indígenas en la Guerra de Independencia de EE.UU.
Desde su estreno en Broadway en noviembre de 2017, Leguizamo se ha presentado más de 80 veces y ha recorrido unas 30 ciudades del país.
Con una carrera sólida que ha incluido celebradas interpretaciones en películas y series como Carlito’s Way y When They See Us, Leguizamo no olvida lo difícil que es ser un actor latino en Hollywood.
“Cuando empecé me decía el mánager ‘cámbiate el nombre, actúa como italiano, no te broncees ‘”, describió a una audiencia mayoritariamente latina en el evento Hispanicize, celebrado a mediados de octubre en Los Ángeles.
* De costa a costa, cómo cambia el español que se habla en EE.UU. y qué variedades predominan
Y añadió que cuando presentaba algún proyecto a un grupo de ejecutivos de la industria, recibía comentarios como “ Los latinos no quieren ver historias positivas ” o “los latinos no quieren ver a otros latinos”.
Cada vez que puede, Leguizamo lanza la contundente aseveración de “apartheid cultural” para enmarcar la escasa representación de latinos en ámbitos como el entretenimiento y la política pese a constituir la minoría racial y étnica más numerosa en el país.
Getty ImagesLos actores latinos constituyen el 4,5% de los papeles con diálogos de Hollywood, de acuerdo a un estudio de este año.
“Hollywood está perpetrando imágenes negativas de los latinos como narcos o gánsters que alimentan directamente esa demonización que Trump hace de nosotros “, critica.
Leguizamo se refirió al presidente de EE.UU., Donald Trump, quien busca la reelección en 2020 y desde que inició su mandato en 2016 ha mantenido una retórica negativa contra los inmigrantes indocumentados de Latinoamérica.
Al preguntarle cómo explica ese “apartheid”, arroja estadísticas como dardos: “En Los Ángeles, casi el 50% de la población es latina y constituimos el 4% de caras frente y detrás de cámara. Eso es un apartheid cultural”.
De acuerdo a un estudio de este año de la Universidad del Sur de California, los actores latinos constituyen solo el 4,5% de los roles con diálogos de Hollywood.
* Estos son los artistas latinos más influyentes de Hollywood
* ¿Hablas español? | 7 claves que muestran el poder y la influencia de nuestro idioma en Estados Unidos
Algo similar dice sobre la ciudad de Nueva York, que con un 29% de población latina (los blancos no hispanos constituyen el 32%), “ no hay igualdad en el número de historias que reflejen las realidades de los latinos en diarios como el New York Times“, sentencia.
La opresión de hace siglos de la que habla en su monólogo continúa hoy en día, agrega el actor. Algo con lo que piensa luchar por toda su carrera.
“¿Por qué Hollywood necesita venir a ti? Crea tu propio Hollywood”, dice.

Acusan a ABC News de censurar pedofilia de Epstein a cambio de entrevista con los príncipes Kate y William

Texto completo: Un video divulgado ayer mostró a la presentadora Amy Robach desahogándose “en privado” porque a su juicio ABC News censuró y subestimó “durante tres años” la historia que estaba proponiendo con entrevistas a víctimas “de pedofilia” del multimillonario Jeffrey Epstein, arrestado y luego hallado muerto en su celda del Bajo Manhattan este verano.
Desde su arresto en julio, The New York Times destacó la amistad en el pasado de Epstein con personalidades como el Príncipe Andrés de Inglaterra, el cineasta Woody Allen y los presidentes Donald Trump y Bill Clinton.
Según el testimonio de Robach divulgado por el portal Project Veritas, ABC News no prestó atención al tema por presión de la familia británica.
“He tenido esta historia durante tres años. He tenido esta entrevista con Virginia Roberts”, dijo Robach a alguien fuera de cámara, refiriéndose a la víctima de abuso sexual más conocida de Epstein. “En primer lugar, me dijeron: “¿Quién es Jeffrey Epstein? Nadie sabe quién es. Ésta es una historia estúpida’”.
La co-anfitriona de “20/20” luego se queja de cómo “el Palacio” (la corona británica) descubrió las acusaciones de Roberts de que era menor de edad cuando tuvo relaciones sexuales con el Príncipe Andrew. El Palacio, detalla Robach, “nos amenazó de un millón de maneras diferentes”.
“Teníamos tanto miedo de no poder entrevistar a (los príncipes) Kate y Will que nosotros (…) eso también anuló la historia”, agregó Robach.
Horas después de la divulgación del video, Robach debió emitir un comunicado a pedido de ABC News, reportó New York Post.
La presentadora dijo entonces sobre el video que fue “atrapada en un momento de frustración privada” , y que fue grabado en julio.
En su declaración, Robach afirmó que estaba “decepcionada” de que su entrevista con Roberts, grabada en 2015, no se emitió al aire ya que no cumplió con los estándares editoriales de ABC News, e insistió en que nunca le habían dicho que dejara de informar sobre el escándalo de Epstein.
Fuentes de ABC News dijeron a Page Six ayer que había “cero verdad” sobre que la entrevista se detuvo a favor de la corte británica y, en particular, como dijo Robach ante la cámara, para obtener una entrevista con el príncipe William y su esposa Kate Middleton.
Aunque la muerte de Epstein fue calificada oficialmente de suicidio por ahorcamiento, en los últimos días han retomado los rumores sobre asesinato por estrangulación.
Attorney Stan Pottinger on ABC's decision not to broadcast Amy Robach's interview with his client, Virginia Giuffre: "I don't remember any reason not to run this that makes sense to us, either as a manner of editorial policy or as a manner of law." https://t.co/jHAvVP8LdJ

Texto completo: El hijo mayor del presidente Donald Trump, tuiteó este miércoles el supuesto nombre del denunciante anónimo que reveló las presiones de su padre sobre Ucrania . La información que compartió Trump Jr. no ha sido corroborada y solo la han compartido pequeñas páginas web vinculadas a la extrema derecha.
La presunta identidad de quien reveló la información que desató el inicio del proceso para el juicio político al mandatario lleva semanas dando vueltas por la red . El propio mandatario ha pedido abiertamente a la prensa que revele el nombre, algo que va en contra de la leyes de protección al denunciante.
En su tuit, Trump Jr. enlazó un artículo de una publicación que sugería que el denunciante apoya a los demócratas y no a su padre. “ No hay denunciante. Hay alguien con intenciones ocultas contra Trump “, tuiteó el presidente el lunes.
Ese mismo día por la noche, en un acto en Kentucky, Trump y el senador republicano Rand Paul instaron a los medios a publicar la identidad del informante. “Nosotros también sabemos ahora el nombre del denunciante. Le dije esta noche a los medios: ‘hagan su trabajo y publiquen su nombre'” . Hasta ahora, según publicó The New York Times, solo se sabe que es un hombre que trabaja como agente de la CIA . The Times también adelantó que dicho agente tenía un amplio conocimiento de la política ucraniana .
La primera que publicó el supuesto nombre aseguró que su identidad había sido un secreto a voces en Washington. Andrew Bakaj, uno de los abogados del informante, no confirmó ni negó el nombre revelado a la agencia AFP y en un comunicado público dijo que “identificar cualquier nombre con el denunciante solo pondría en riesgo a esa persona y a su familia”.
Trump Jr. se ha desmarcado de los comentarios que le acusan de revelar una información que puede poner en peligro la vida del denunciante. El hijo del presidente se lava las manos asegurando que el nombre era público desde hace semanas.
The entire media is #Triggered that I (a private citizen) tweeted out a story naming the alleged whistleblower. Are they going to pretend that his name hasn’t been in the public domain for weeks now? Numerous people & news outlets including Real Clear Politics already ID’d him. https://t.co/bcamyTaXP3

Texto completo: Don't count your royalties yet, Anonymous.
The Justice Department has reportedly whipped off a letter warning the nameless Trump administration official that he or she may be violating a nondisclosure agreement by writing a tell-all book.
The department demanded the publisher of "A Warning" hand over any nondisclosure agreements the author may have signed. The publisher called it "intimidation" and refused to comply, CNN reported.
"Our author knows that the president is determined to unmask whistleblowers who may be in his midst. That's one of the reasons 'A Warning' was written," the literacy agency Javelin said in a statement. Hachette Books announced it would publish the book - set to hit bookstores Nov. 19 - as planned. "A Warning" is billed as an inside look at the White House, including direct quotes from Trump. The official published an opinion piece in The New York Times last year under the byline Anonymous claiming among other things that officials sometimes swiped documents off Trump's desk to prevent him from taking unilateral actions. Trump alternately demanded to know the writer's identity and claimed that he or she doesn't really exist.

Texto completo: Kenneth McCallion is a New York lawyer who once represented former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko of Ukraine. A few years ago, he brought a civil racketeering lawsuit on her behalf against some now familiar figures like Paul Manafort and the Ukrainian oligarch Dmitry Firtash. He knows a lot about corruption in Ukraine, and he said that earlier this year FBI counterintelligence investigators approached him for information about Rudy Giuliani’s Ukrainian activities.
By then, McCallion had already been hearing strange things about what Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, whom we now know as Giuliani’s close associates, were doing in Ukraine.
Parnas and Fruman, both American citizens born in the former Soviet Union, aren’t ordinary political operatives. Parnas has long been a low-level grifter. Fruman owns an Odessa beach club called Mafia Rave, and a joint investigation by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project and BuzzFeed News found ties between him and an Odessa organized crime figure named Volodymyr Galanternik, known as “Light Bulb.”
The duo first appeared on the American political scene in 2015 as enthusiastic supporters of Donald Trump. They became big-dollar donors to a number of Republicans; their Instagram accounts would soon fill up with photos of party elites. Then, this year, McCallion learned they were poking around Ukrainian politics, where they were spreading conspiracy theories that Ukraine, not Russia, had interfered in America’s election in 2016.
“All of a sudden they started going around Ukraine telling anybody who would listen, particularly with the government, that they have been advised by a high-level, mysterious unnamed source, that in fact the DNC servers had been hidden in Ukraine, that Russia was not the origin,” he told me.
This claim, which echoed Russian propaganda, contradicts the findings of the FBI, the CIA and the Republican-controlled Senate Intelligence Committee. Nevertheless, it soon came to shape American foreign policy.
The heart of the Ukraine scandal, for which Trump will almost certainly be impeached, is simple. Trump used congressionally appropriated aid to Ukraine, as well as the promise of a White House visit, to try to extort Ukraine’s president to announce investigations that would benefit Trump politically.
But there’s a broader story that’s still murky, because in this scandal Trump is both the perpetrator and the mark. Trump used the power of his office to try to force Ukraine to substantiate conspiracy theories. But the president was fed those conspiracy theories by people with their own agendas, who surely understood that he is insecure about Russia’s role in his election, and he will believe whatever serves his ego in the moment.
The main reason Trump should be removed from office is that he has subverted American foreign policy for corrupt personal ends. But this scandal is the latest reminder of how easy sinister forces find it to pull his strings.
On Saturday, BuzzFeed News obtained previously secret documents from Robert Mueller’s investigation via Freedom of Information Act lawsuits. The documents showed that Manafort, convicted felon and Trump’s former campaign chairman, was pushing the story that Ukraine was to blame for hacking the DNC as far back as 2016. Manafort seems to have picked up that narrative from his associate Konstantin Kilimnik, a former Russian intelligence officer who, according to federal prosecutors, “has ties to a Russian intelligence service and had such ties in 2016.”
At first glance it might seem as if Parnas and Fruman were just doing Giuliani’s bidding when, in 2019, they started pushing the same disinformation. But Giuliani wasn’t paying them — they were paying Giuliani. Parnas, in turn, was being paid by Firtash, who is, according to the Justice Department, an “upper echelon” associate of Russian organized crime. Firtash is also close to the Kremlin; a Ukrainian official once described him as “representing Russia’s interests in Ukraine.”
Firtash, who made his fortune as a middleman in Ukraine’s natural gas industry, is stuck in Vienna, fighting extradition to the United States for trial on bribery and racketeering charges. Last month, when Parnas and Fruman were arrested while attempting to leave the United States on one-way tickets, Vienna was their destination.
On Friday, CNN reported that Parnas boasted of the “luxurious lifestyle” Firtash bankrolled. “Beginning in mid-August, this included around-the-clock bodyguards, two luxury SUVs for his entourage, and at least six private charter flights in the past several months,” CNN said. It’s hard to imagine what Firtash would have been paying for besides access to Trump.
It was reportedly Firtash’s lawyers who first obtained an affidavit from fired Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin claiming, falsely, that Joe Biden had targeted Shokin for investigating Burisma, a Ukrainian natural gas company that had Hunter Biden on its board. Giuliani would later wave this affidavit around on cable television as proof of his claims against Joe Biden.
Firtash’s motives aren’t hard to grasp. As he fights extradition, he has obvious reasons to want to ingratiate himself with Trump. It was in his interest to see the former Ukrainian ambassador Marie Yovanovitch fired, because her work against corruption — particularly her support for the reform-minded chief executive of Naftogaz, Ukraine’s national gas company — threatened his business interests. And by helping to spread damaging conspiracy theories about Ukraine, he aided his allies in the Kremlin.
“It serves the interest of Russian intelligence to cause further consternation and confusion by pointing the finger at Ukraine rather than Russia for the 2016 successful disinformation campaign,” said McCallion.
In court last month, a lawyer for Parnas said that some evidence against him could be subject to executive privilege, apparently because his work with Giuliani overlapped with Giuliani’s work for Trump. If that’s true, then Firtash is directly linked to America’s president.
The two men may have used each other, but there’s no reason to believe that Trump was the one in control. There was a time when Republicans would be mortified by an American president being manipulated by a figure like Firtash. Lucky for them, they’ve lost the ability to feel shame.

Texto completo: No nevará este año tan temprano como se había alertado en la ciudad de Nueva York, pero el pronóstico de clima cruel se mantiene, con lluvia helada la noche del jueves.
Los meteorólogos inicialmente predijeron que la ciudad posiblemente vería una nevada húmeda el jueves por la noche hasta el viernes, a medida que las temperaturas cayesen, pero eso ahora ha cambiado, destacó New York Post.
Los neoyorquinos pueden esperar una lluvia muy fría el jueves por la noche , cuando se espera que la temperatura caerá a 38 grados F (3 C).
“Si se ve algo de nieve, será en los suburbios lejanos del Valle del Hudson y Nueva Jersey”, dijo hoy el meteorólogo principal de AccuWeather, Paul Walker. “No creo que haya nada cerca de la ciudad”, más allá de una lluvia helada.
Para el viernes por la mañana se pronostica que el sol brillará en NYC, aunque seguirá el frío, con un máximo de 42 grados y un mínimo de 30F (5 a -1C).
Se espera que los primeros copos de la temporada caigan en el noreste, con un par de centímetros de nieve.
Mucho más se pronostica para el norte de Maine, que podría acumular de 6 a 12 pulgadas de nieve a medida que pasa la tormenta, previó Walker.
El año pasado, la primera nevada llegó por sorpresa a NYC el 15 de noviembre, desatando un caos en el transporte y fuertes críticas a las autoridades por la falta de previsión.
Las 6.4 pulgadas de nieve que cayeron ayer esa noche en Central Park constituyeron la mayor nevada en noviembre en al menos 136 años, reportó The New York Times.

Texto completo: Is President Donald Trump going to win reelection? Numerous national polls show him losing to all three of the leading Democratic candidates: Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden, and Bernie Sanders. But, as many voters learned the hard way in 2016, just because your candidate is leading in the polls doesn’t mean you should stock up on confetti.
For one thing, national polls – which were largely accurate in 2016 – only indicate the likely popular vote. Predicting the Electoral College results requires a state-by-state analysis, which can portray a very different picture.
Last time around, an overwhelming majority of polls showed Hillary Clinton leading in key swing states, but Mr. Trump swept to victory on the back of incredibly narrow margins in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. This week a new round of surveys shows that President Trump remains close or ahead in those state battlegrounds that won him the Oval Office three years ago. 
The miss on state polls in 2016 was due to numerous factors, but pollsters bore the brunt of the criticism. So, have they adjusted their methods to be more accurate? In some cases, yes. At the same time, fundamental changes in both the polling and media industries present an ongoing problem. And no one is claiming complete confidence – especially when Mr. Trump is involved.
“The things that we can fix, we’ve fixed,” says Patrick Murray, director of Monmouth University Polling Institute in New Jersey. “But then there are things that are never fixable because each election presents its own sets of challenges.”
A snapshot of the race It’s still a long way to Election Day 2020, but one year out, polls can give a sense of where the race stands at this moment.
A new Washington Post/ABC survey shows President Trump behind Mr. Biden by 17 points, behind Senator Warren by 15 points, and behind Senator Sanders by 14 points. Poll averages show the Democratic contenders with smaller but still substantial margins.
But the national popular vote doesn’t elect the president. The Electoral College does, on a state-by-state basis. At the moment that’s presenting a somewhat different picture.
A just-released New York Times Upshot/Siena College series of state polls shows President Trump either ahead or within the margin of error of his three main Democratic rivals, among likely voters, in six key battlegrounds, from Michigan to North Carolina.
Which measure matters most? That might not be settled until the election is over.
“... the national poll versus state poll discussion over the next 12 months is going to be painful,” tweeted Dante Chinni, a data journalist and director of the American Communities Project, on Nov. 5.
Polling, explained Poll results sound so definitive, like the results of a running race. But polling and the statistical modeling underlying the results involve a set of assumptions that are not usually made explicit, says Michael Traugott, a research professor emeritus at the University of Michigan’s Institute for Social Research. Two of the trickiest aspects have to do with figuring out how representative survey respondents are of the general population and the people who will turn out to vote.
If a pollster were to survey 500 students on a 2,000-student campus about what their favorite flavor of ice cream is, she could evaluate how closely her sample of 500 students matches the total population of 2,000 students. She might look at gender, year in school, and other factors, such as whether she got a disproportionate sample of pistachio lovers because she interviewed people outside an exotic nut shop. Then she could weight the results accordingly so that she wouldn’t overemphasize the pistachio lovers’ input.
But if she were trying to capture preferences ahead of an election to decide which flavor of ice cream would be served on campus, she would also have to guess which of the 2,000 students would turn up to vote, and how similar they would be to her sample. Will all the Ben & Jerry’s Phish Food lovers be sacked out on their couches from overindulgence?
In 2012, the U.S. electorate was significantly different than in 2016, which made it difficult for pollsters to accurately predict who would be voting. In addition, voters’ preferences in 2016 were much more correlated to education level; in particular, white men without college degrees voted disproportionately for Mr. Trump. But many pollsters didn’t factor in education level since it hadn’t mattered much in the past.
After the election, Andrew Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center in Durham, weighted his data to education levels and found his results were then precisely in line with the actual election result.
But the lack of education weighting didn’t account for all the discrepancies in state polls.
“I have weighted to education since I was a wee babe in diapers,” says Charles Franklin, director of the Marquette Law School Poll in Wisconsin. “Unfortunately that didn’t keep me from being wrong – I still had Clinton up by 6 [points].”
The main reason for that, he says, was the fact that undecided voters disproportionately cast their ballots for Mr. Trump.
A famous polling miss In the 1948 presidential election, the Chicago Tribune had to go to press before all the results were in. So, relying on polling, they infamously declared, “Dewey Defeats Truman.”
They were wrong. Postmortems pinned the miss on the use of quota sampling, a technique in which interviewers decided who to contact within certain parameters, such as nine white men under age 50 in a rural area. Ever since, pollsters have used random sampling to ensure more accurate results. That is best done by live telephone interviews, selecting randomly from all current phone numbers. But in the age of caller ID, about 95% of the people called don’t answer, or refuse to talk.
At the state level, the response rates are somewhat higher, but still plummeting. Dr. Smith in New Hampshire says that just four years ago, his team was able to complete about 0.9 interviews per hour. Now it’s down to about half that, doubling the costs of a survey from about $25,000 to $50,000 or more.
That is driving many survey outlets to explore alternatives to random sampling, which Dr. Smith says has been the gold standard for decades.
“You’re seeing a movement away from that, which to me is a fundamental change in the industry,” he says.
Misinterpretation by journalists Likewise, fundamental shifts in journalism have compounded the problem.
As newspaper budgets shrink, many don’t have the funds to conduct polls at the state level – or retain veteran reporters to interpret them.
“We have a lot of journalists who weren’t well-trained to begin with in terms of statistics, and besides that they’re getting younger and they’re less experienced,” says Dr. Traugott, who got his start as a research assistant for George Gallup in the 1960s.
For example, if a poll were to show Ms. Warren 2 points ahead of Mr. Biden with a +/- 3 point margin of error, journalists should report that as a statistical tie. But instead, they often present such results as showing an unequivocal lead.
Moreover, if journalists can’t or don’t evaluate the relative credibility of polls, then they drive down the market for higher-quality telephone polls, which at the national level cost $100,000 compared with as little as $5,000 for an online poll, according to a report on 2016 election polls by the American Association for Public Opinion.
The more care and effort you put into collecting the data, the easier it is to analyze the data, says Andrew Mercer, a senior research methodologist at Pew Research Center.
“The flip side of that is the easier and quicker your data collection is ... in order to be accurate with those, you really have to have a good understanding of what are the important variables that predict how somebody is going to behave and make sure you’re able to adjust those variables in your analysis,” he says.
How to tell if a pollster is good, or not So, what is a voter to do? No. 1, look at how transparent the organization is about its methodology. One indication of that is whether it is a member of AAPOR’s Transparency Initiative. While transparency doesn’t guarantee accuracy, it tends to signal credibility.
For a professional estimate of accuracy, FiveThirtyEight.com assigns letter grades to each election polling organization in its list of latest polls, but users have to dig deep to discover the methodology behind each poll, including whether it was done by phone or online.
Some experts recommend that voters look at polling averages, with the hope that bad polls will cancel each other out. But Dr. Smith urges caution about that approach.
“If you took a glass of pure Poland Spring water, and mixed it together with a glass of water from a mud puddle, would you want to drink it?” he asks.

Trump was speaking out against the House impeachment inquiry into his father, President Donald Trump, and discussing his new book, "Triggered: How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us," on Fox and Friends when he was asked about his tweeting habits.
"True or false: Your dad asked you to stop tweeting during the election, or after he got the job," host Brian Kilmeade asked Trump.
"There were a couple of times," Trump said, laughing.
"It took me 41 years to realize that I was probably a lot more like him than we ever thought, and you know, backed in a corner, we fight," Trump said. "But every once in awhile I get that call, like, 'Hey, you're getting a little hot on social. ' I go, 'Wait a minute. '"
Donald Trump Jr. : Promoting book, he says impeachment process will 'totally vindicate' father
The New York Times previously reported that Trump writes in his book he was cautioned about his "aggressive" social media defense over allegations of a conspiracy with Russia. His lawyers and even his father, who is known for his active Twitter account, told him to slow it down, he writes.

But Trump said on Fox that this is the one issue he won't take his father's advice on: "Maybe you don’t have the authority to start talking about this. "
Trump's book, released Tuesday, is an attack on the news media, Democrats and others who oppose the president, the Times reported. While promoting the book, Trump has taken the opportunity to defend his father.
President Donald Trump is currently the subject of an impeachment inquiry led by House Democrats over his interactions with Ukraine after concerns surfaced he may have pressured that country to investigate domestic political rivals.

Texto completo: Recently, on The Jim Bakker Show (yes, that Jim Bakker), Central Florida pastor and Donald Trump spiritual adviser Paula White warned of consequences from God for those who don't stand with the president.
Last Sunday, Joe Biden was reportedly denied communion at a Catholic Church in South Carolina by a priest who objects to the former vice president's support for abortion rights.
And Vero Beach pastor Rick Wiles darkly predicted on his TruNews show that if Trump is removed from office - he didn't specify how - then cowboys, mountain men and veterans would "hunt down" those responsible and punish them.
So exists the state of religion - or at least, a politicized slice of it - in 2019, where fealty to an earthly politician is the difference between heaven and hell or war and peace.
We're particularly appalled - though not surprised - by Paula White.
Not because she's a conservative but because of her naked use of religion as a weapon. She's trying to frighten believers with apocalyptic consequences if they don't get in line behind this president.
Unfortunately, the national attention on these self-promoting evangelical opportunists risks overshadowing the selfless work of Christian churches and missions that help people who are hungry, poor, sick and homeless.
Here in Central Florida, groups like the Catholic Charities, the Christian Service Center and IDignity better represent the Christian faith tradition.
White's view of faith's role in our lives is, let's say, different from that.
White, who led a large church in Apopka until last summer, has long been associated with "prosperity gospel," which in shorthand means if you give money to the church then God will reward the giver with even more money. (White has rejected the prosperity label, but if the label fits ...)
She also has a long association with Trump, praying at his inauguration and his reelection rally last summer in Orlando. This for a president who wears the mantle of a Christian but is on the record saying he's never sought forgiveness for his sins, a central tenet of Christianity. On Thursday, that association deepened further, with White joining the administration, according to a New York Times report.
Donald Trump and Paula White ... they are a match made in heaven.
White was on Bakker's show to extol the president's virtues, and to flog her new book, which a review in Christian Today called narcissistic, dishonest, materialistic, shallow and "Trumpesque."
"After spending time around Donald Trump I find myself inspired by his vision, thought process, keen insight, and overall discipline," she gushes in the book. "He's a brilliant thinker who tends to walk several steps ahead of the masses. I want to share his wisdom with the world in my own way."
The book received endorsements from other religious leaders who move in the president's circle of loyal evangelicals, including Robert Jeffress, Jerry Falwell Jr., Ralph Reed and Billy Graham's son, Franklin Graham (who has since deleted a tweet encouraging his followers to buy the book).
They understand that the evangelical voting bloc is to the president's reelection chances, and that books like White's help keep that bloc in line.
People who identify as evangelical are far more accepting of the president and his behavior than any other group of voters. The Public Religion Research Institute reports that three in every four white evangelical Protestants approve of the job Trump is doing, far higher than any other religious group.
So evangelical leaders - some of them, anyway - exploit elements of religion not to further the cause of faith but to achieve a political end.
It's not hard to figure out why: Paula White and her kind will never be more visible or relevant in politics than they are with Donald Trump in office.
That's why they go about the cynical work of weaponizing religion, in contrast to the many Christians who quietly go about the hard work of growing their faith and using it to aid the afflicted.
This editorial first appeared in the Orlando Sentinel.

POLL: BIDEN LEADS DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES AGAINST TRUMP IN PA.

Texto completo: Pennsylvania Democratic leaders said that although new polling shows President Donald Trump in virtual toss-ups in swing states with leading Democratic presidential candidates, they're mostly encouraged by the data, which has former Vice President Joe Biden leading the pack.
The poll, conducted by The New York Times Upshot and Siena College in mid-October and released Monday, has Mr. Biden beating Mr. Trump in a general election matchup by 3 points among registered voters in Pennsylvania. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders follows, beating Mr. Trump by 1 point here, with Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren registering a tie with the president.
When likely voters are considered, Mr. Biden has a 1-point lead over Mr. Trump in Pennsylvania, while Mr. Trump beats Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren by 1 and 2 points, respectively.
All findings were within the poll's margin of error, indicating a near-tie in Pennsylvania - a key state in Mr. Trump's pursuit of a second term - despite the president's low approval rating and the House's impeachment inquiry.
The head of the Democratic Party in Erie County, considered by analysts to be one of the nation's bellwether counties in 2020, said the new poll shows the election is winnable for Democrats.
"The challenge for Democrats will be unifying the party around our nominee," Erie Democrats chairman Jim Wertz said. "We'll do that in the same way we'll win over moderate Republicans and win back change-centered Democrats and independents: by talking to them about specific issues that drive their electoral decision-making."
Mr. Trump carried Erie County by just under 2,000 votes in 2016 over Democrat Hillary Clinton. Though the city of Erie is a Democratic stronghold, Mr. Wertz said most rural areas of Pennsylvania are oriented toward specific issues such as "health care protections for people with pre-existing conditions and individual liberties" - which will require a candidate to communicate authentically about the day-to-day issues facing Americans.
Mr. Biden has long been named by moderate Democrats in Pennsylvania as a desired nominee and as someone who has the best chance to beat the president.
The only other significant polling of Pennsylvania was conducted in May and also showed the former vice president leading the field in a general election matchup against Mr. Trump. His lead in that poll, by Quinnipiac University, was 11 points, while Mr. Sanders held a 7-point advantage against Mr. Trump, and Ms. Warren, 3 points.
Even in an area where Hillary Clinton won by more than 9% in 2016, a moderate candidate is desired by the county chair.
Dick Bingham, chair of the Chester County Democratic Committee, said he expects a "moderate, left-of-center candidate" to win the primary in his county, as well as the rest of Pennsylvania.
But nothing in the county, he said, suggests Mr. Trump has momentum heading into 2020. Mr. Bingham pointed to Democrats sweeping local elections there in 2017, followed by large wins for Sen. Bob Casey and Gov. Tom Wolf the following year. In 2018, the county also elected a Democrat, Chrissy Houlahan, to Congress for the first time ever.
Pennsylvania Republicans reacted to the poll Monday by casting doubt on polling in general - after polls incorrectly predicted the result of the 2016 election - and said Mr. Trump is winning outright.
Jim Foreman, who chairs the Republican committee in bright red Blair County, said he has seen nothing but positive impacts from the Trump presidency on Pennsylvania - including a strong economy and low unemployment.
"President Trump is delivering on the campaign promises he made in 2016," Mr. Foreman said. "Most of the people I talk to in Central Pa. see it just that way."
In Lackawanna County, where Ms. Clinton won by about 3%, the chair of the GOP pointed to voter registration statistics that show Democrats are shrinking in numbers in the leadup to 2020, saying that shows that Mr. Trump's message is resonating.
Democratic leaders in Trump strongholds claimed they're seeing positive signs on the ground.
Dan Sidelnick, chair of Democrats in Lebanon County - where Mr. Trump more than doubled Ms. Clinton three years ago - said he thinks Pennsylvania will be close no matter who the Democrats select as their nominee. There are many traditional Republicans who are not happy with the president, he said.
But, he added, "there are also many 'Trump Republicans' who didn't vote very often before 2016 who are now energized to continue the disruption caused by the last election against the establishment."
In nearby Washington County, Democratic chairman Ben Bright said the average voter "knows little about the candidates beyond Joe Biden" and that his party is working hard to make sure every candidate can get in front of voters.
But, Mr. Bright added, the electorate is leaning away from Mr. Trump, as evidenced by statewide wins in the midterms and Democrats sending five new members to Congress since 2016.

Professor explores the ethics of educating children

Texto completo: Valley News Staff Writer
University of Vermont philosophy professor Tyler Doggett has a friend who puts him to shame when they go skiing together. Maybe he had better instructors when he was younger, maybe he got more time on the slopes or maybe someone in his life provided the necessary push to get him out of his comfort zone at just the right time.
Whatever the reason, Doggett — like most people in similar situations — just accepts that different people excel at different things and that talent and opportunity aren’t distributed equally.
If that’s the case, why do disparate outcomes elicit such hand wringing in educational settings? What are the key ethical differences between an achievement gap on the slopes and an achievement gap in the classroom?
Doggett won’t offer clear-cut answers to questions like those in his talk “The Ethics of Raising Children,” Wednesday evening at 7 at Norwich Congregational Church. Rather, his lecture, part of the Vermont Humanities Council’s First Wednesdays Lecture Series, is meant to get people thinking deeply about the ethical quandaries they face — or choose not to face — on a regular basis as parents, educators and community members.
“I think a lot of everyday life is caught up in pretty profound ethical issues,” Doggett said. “One thing I’m looking forward to is just talking to thoughtful people about these issues.”
The first half of Doggett’s lecture will focus mostly on the achievement gap, the term applied to the variations in academic performance among different groups. Doggett, who teaches and researches about a variety of philosophy topics and specializes in food ethics, said he became interested in the topic in part by reading books and articles that illuminate the ethical issues at the heart of public and private education.
Norwich makes an interesting setting for such a discussion. The town spends $17,700 per pupil, according to 2017 data from the Vermont Agency of Education, the 13th highest rate in the state. And just 3.52% of students in the Dresden School District, where Norwich students attend secondary school, qualify for free or reduced lunch, a common measure of poverty. If there’s an achievement gap here, it’s pretty microscopic.
But zooming out on the educational landscape of Vermont, one can see an enormous achievement gap between towns like Norwich and poorer rural communities.
The implications of that is what Doggett wants to discuss. “If you think some sort of educational achievement gap is problematic, what should individual parents do about it?” said Doggett, who lives in Burlington and has two middle-school-age children of his own. “It’s an important moral issue.”
Neither wealthy families nor working class families have a corner on good parenting, Doggett said. As Annette Lareau explains in her 2003 book Unequal Childhoods, rich parents tend to “cultivate” their children, while poorer families trend more towards a “natural growth” model.
The problem, Doggett said, is that society is set up in such a way that rewards the good aspects of rich parenting much more than the good aspects of parenting in poorer families. Middle class kids, for example, tend to be much more self-sufficient than their more fastidiously tended peers. “But there’s no SAT for self sufficiency,” he said.
Trying to buck the system isn’t easy from a parenting perspective either. In her 2016 New York Times Magazine article “Choosing a School for My Daughter in a Segregated City,” journalist Nikole Hannah-Jones chronicles what happened when her ideals about equality in education collided with her parental values. The article profoundly affected Doggett’s views by highlighting one of the most salient ethical quandaries some parents will face.
It’s hardly the only one, though. With such a rich field from which to glean philosophical grist, Doggett plans to leave the second half of his lecture open for topics on people’s minds.
Just don’t expect easy answers. In an era dominated by sound bites and bulleted lists, the beauty of philosophy is its prismatic quality, said Doggett, who loves bringing philosophy to general audiences through events like Public Philosophy Week and resources like the open access philosophy website Wi-Phi.
That doesn’t mean philosophy needs to be dry and difficult, just that it encourages critical thinking over pat answers.
“I think there’s an intrinsic value in figuring out the right explanation for something,” Doggett said. “Philosophy allows you to gain some understanding of what it is you’re doing and why it matters.”

Texto completo: There is some evidence that eating fish may make children smarter.
Does fish make children smarter? There is some evidence that it might.
In two reviews of data from 44 studies, researchers have concluded that eating seafood during pregnancy and childhood is associated with improved performance on tests of mental skills.
The analyses, published in the journal PLEFA, included 29 studies with 102,944 mother-child pairs, and 15 reports on 25,031 children under 18.
Almost all of the studies on seafood consumption during pregnancy and lactation reported beneficial outcomes for children, including five that found that compared to children of mothers who ate none, those whose mothers ate more than 12 ounces of seafood a week had significantly higher verbal I.Q. scores.
In children, the benefits of eating seafood were apparent as early as 14 months. The studies variously found that seafood eaters had lower risk of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, better school grades, and higher I.Q. by as much as 9.5 points compared with their peers who ate no fish. The highest intakes -- more than 8 to 12 ounces a week -- were associated with the greatest benefits.
Pregnant woman have been advised to avoid eating fish high in mercury, such as tuna and swordfish. Three of the studies that included data on mercury content reported that the beneficial effect was present even with elevated levels of mercury.
The lead author, Tom Brenna, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Texas at Austin, said that the results presented an overwhelmingly positive picture of seafood consumption. "Not only did we find very positive results in most studies, but we found no adverse effects, even at the highest levels of consumption," he said.

Texto completo: It has been heralded as an architectural triumph: A new $ 41.5 million public library in Long Island City that ascends over multiple landings and terraces, providing stunning Manhattan views to patrons as they browse books and explore.
But several of the terraces at the Hunters Point Library are inaccessible to people who cannot climb to them. A staircase and bleacher seating in the children's section, judged too risky for small children, has been closed off. And the five-story, vertically designed building only has one elevator, creating bottlenecks at times.
The accessibility issues, some of which have been angrily called out in social media posts and elsewhere online since the library's Sept. 24 opening, have left officials with the Queens Public Library hurrying to find solutions and the architects exploring ways to retrofit the building.
It has also raised the question of how the pricey public building, nearly two decades in the works, made it through the lengthy planning process without more consideration for accessibility.
Some of the issues are a result of the building's popularity.
New Yorkers -- as well as tourists -- are visiting the library, the most expensive Queens Public Library branch ever built, to admire the views. So are architecture buffs, eager to see a structure that a New York Times review praised as "among the finest and most uplifting public buildings New York has produced so far this century."
Some of the accessibility problems, though, are rooted in the design itself.
The placement of the adult fiction section on three terracelike levels between the library's first and second floors was the first issue patrons noticed. A few complained that they couldn't access the fiction books, because those levels were only accessible by stairs, Gothamist reported.
Queens Library officials responded that librarians could simply retrieve those books for disabled patrons, a solution in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, and noted that the first of the four terraces did have elevator access.
But on social media and among advocates for the disabled, that rationale got panned.
"To me, that is the response of somebody who never had the experience of going somewhere and not being able to fully participate," said Christine Yearwood, founder of the disability rights group, Up-Stand. "Part of what universal design is about is allowing everyone to independently enjoy spaces. Having to ask someone else to help you is, at worst, demeaning, and at best, a limiting experience."
The disputed shelves are now bare; the library, responding to the criticism, has moved the 2,900 adult fiction books to an accessible area on the second floor, and is now figuring out how to use the vacated space.
Chris McVoy, a senior partner at Steven Holl Architects, the firm that designed the building, said that too much emphasis was being placed on the inaccessibility of the terraces, which he called a "small wrinkle in an incredibly successful project." Concepts of accessibility, he added, have changed in the years since the building was designed in 2010.
"To be honest, we hadn't thought, 'O.K. we have to provide an exactly equivalent browsing experience,"' he said. "This will be a new standard for libraries, and that's great. But that doesn't mean it's a flaw in the design. It's an evolution."
But the decision to build only a single elevator is also causing grumbles. The congestion is compounded by the placement of the main stroller parking area on a second floor landing, which is insufficient for the dozens of strollers sometimes seeking a spot.
"It's crazy right now," said Nikki Rheaume, one of three children's librarians, as she tried to navigate a crush of strollers around the second floor elevator last Wednesday, when dozens of strollers descended on the building. "It's chaos."
It was 10:30 a.m. -- toddler story time -- and a rush of caregivers, having just come upstairs to park, were attempting to go back down for the program.
The closure of the children's wing stairs is adding congestion to the elevator. Patrons who want to travel between the children's levels must now either use the elevator, or take a circuitous route around the library, up and down flights of stairs.
In his 2010 renderings for the children's wing, Steven Holl, the project's lead architect, had sketched images of children reading on bleacher-like seats that spanned from the lower level of the wing to the upper one, adjoined by an interior staircase.
But library officials, in a walk-through before the building opened, instead saw a potential liability for small children who could jump and fall on them. They have closed off the stairs and the top five bleachers until fixes can be made, said Elisabeth de Bourbon, a spokeswoman for the Queens Library.
Wood panels now block the staircase entrances and protective glass barriers have been added to the tallest bleachers. The bottom three bleachers remain open, however, and a security guard who usually stands there keeps an eye on them.
Vedesh Persaud, 32, who was visiting the children's wing with his wife and their toddler daughter, Arya, praised the new library, as did most patrons.
"The curves of the space are pretty amazing," he said. "It does give you a sense of openness."
But his wife, Ravina, said she was surprised that the architects had overlooked the potential hazard of the children's stairs.
"I'm sure that they didn't have kids," she said, "because as a parent, you know these things."
Mr. McVoy said that the building would adapt and the stairs would reopen, perhaps after adding gates.
"What the lawyers believe is safe or not is a constantly evolving thing in this society," he said. "Five years ago, they wouldn't have even thought to block off that area, or even two years ago."
How the planning process for the building did not include more of a consideration for accessibility has left critics puzzled and frustrated.
Planning for a library in Long Island City has been underway since 2001, when the old industrial neighborhood was being reborn. Library, city and community officials fought for years to secure funding and navigate bureaucratic hurdles to complete it.
Over time, the leadership of Queens Library system has changed several times, so everyone involved in the original planning is gone, officials said. Neither Mr. McVoy nor the Queens Library spokeswoman could recall a public hearing about the library's design, though the community had been involved in aspects of the library's creation.
When Dennis M. Walcott, a former New York City schools chancellor, took over the helm of the Queens Library system in 2016, the branch was just an empty shell on the Long Island City waterfront. By that point, Mr. Walcott said in an interview, the focus was on finishing the building, not in rethinking its details.
Now more than a month old, the library is navigating what Ms. de Bourbon called "significant growing pains" as staff learn how to adapt to the realities of running a branch library in a vertical work of art. There have been several other small problems as well. There is already more cracking than is typical in the terrazzo concrete floors because the contractor didn't provide sufficient "control joints," but that is only a visual, not a structural issue, Mr. McVoy said. Several small leaks, first reported on by the New York Post, have been repaired.
Starting this month, librarians said, there will be two, back-to-back story times in the mornings, to help alleviate the stroller bottleneck and waiting lists of children. A small lift may be added to the stepped terraces so the books can be returned to them as Mr. Holl envisioned.
"It's a gorgeous building, and people are reveling in both the aesthetic nature of it and the functional use of the building," Mr. Walcott said. "Our goal now is to make sure it is responding to the needs of the public."

Texto completo: My eighth marathon was not pretty. But I broke six hours. Barely.
When the last wave of runners started the New York City Marathon on Sunday, Joyciline Jepkosgei of Kenya had nearly completed her victory in the women's race. Back on the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge, Frank Sinatra had sung "New York, New York" so many times through the morning, even his recorded voice seemed to have laryngitis.
Those of us in the final wave were mostly back-of-the-packers. A number of us did not look like classic marathoners. Many, it appeared, had never run 26.2 miles. Our bibs read 60,862 and 70,267 and 72,237, numbers that seemed more like mortgage balances than race entries. Time seemed irrelevant. The goal was to finish. Anywhere but last.
"I am a slow runner," said the back of one woman's shirt. "Please let there be someone behind me."
I am 65, and this was my eighth, and probably final, marathon. I started jogging nearly 40 years ago, while losing 70 pounds. There is nothing so elemental and uplifting as running, the light movement through the air, the warbling of birds in the quiet of early morning, the gracious support of people like Kadir, a cashier at a 7-Eleven in suburban Philadelphia where I bought water on my marathon training runs.
"I encourage you! I encourage you!" Kadir yelled at me from behind the counter, his words like anointing oil. "Good job! Good job!"
Still, this marathon was more about pain management than excited running. I did something foolish after falling on my right knee in April, never consulting a doctor, seeing a physical therapist only in the last two weeks. If I finished Sunday's race, it would take more than five hours.
Was I driven by a darker impulse? Did I still fear waking up and weighing 240 pounds again? Was I trying to compensate for my shortcomings as a reporter? My failure to write every book I wanted to write? My decision to become a sportswriter instead of the doctor my parents wanted me to be?
"Why do we keep at this? That's a very good question," said Fred Abramowitz, 67, a native of Brooklyn who ran the first New York City Marathon through the five boroughs in 1976 and, by his count, has run 75 marathons and 50 to 75 ultramarathons.
"I think we all have a desire to test ourselves, no matter the age," Abramowitz, who now lives in Fort Collins, Colo., said as we awaited Sunday's race.
He added, "At least we're on the right side of the lawn."
By that, he meant not buried beneath it.
Roberta Valentini of Bologna, Italy, ran her first marathon at age 75 on Sunday, undaunted that it would take her more than seven hours. "I like the pure air," she said.
Mary Miller of Haddon Heights, N.J., also ran her first marathon, a month short of her 65th birthday. She lost 60 pounds and entered her first race, a 5K, in 2013, finishing last. But she steadily built her miles and has completed six triathlons. "It gives me a lot of confidence," Miller said, also unbothered in her prediction that it would take seven hours to complete the New York course.
"I'm slow, but who isn't," she said. "I compete against myself."
Abramowitz and I set off together, determined to finish by sundown. At five miles, though, I fumbled with a pack of gel and lost him. I never caught up, drifting far behind his finishing time of 5 hours 27 minutes 14 seconds.
Running alone, I soaked in the New York atmosphere: The loud and encouraging crowds, the bands, the signs that read, "This is a lot of work for a free banana" and "Pain is just French for bread." At 14 miles, I was high-fived by a woman and her cat.
The pain in my knee eventually disappeared, bathed by endorphins. On the 59th Street Bridge, from Mile 15 to 16, I ran while many people walked. A man dropped his phone and struggled to pick it up, his knees bent and legs spread uncertainly as if riding a surfboard for the first time.
Along First Avenue, I saw a sign that said, "Sure, running keeps you healthy, but God, at what cost?" I soon began to wonder myself when I grew distracted at a hydration station and nearly ate a sponge.
From 18 miles on, I began to doubt whether I could finish. My right calf seized. My legs became heavy. It felt like hurdling to step over manhole covers. As I scuffed along, I kept thinking of the remarkable perseverance of Amy Palmiero-Winters of Hicksville, N.Y.
In April, I wrote about her at the Marathon des Sables in the Sahara in Morocco. She became the first female amputee to complete the race, one of the world's toughest, the rough equivalent of running a marathon a day through the desert for six days.
During her bad moments, her goal became simple: stay ahead of the camels that trailed the last runners during each stage. "At the end of the day, no one cares about our times," Palmiero-Winters texted me before Sunday's race. "It's that we stay ahead of the camels."
About two miles from the finish, Naila-Jean Meyers, an editor in the New York Times sports department, spotted me in Central Park. The moment felt so elevating, but only briefly. My left thigh cramped and an inflamed tendon arced fire across the top of my right foot.
I thought of something else that Palmiero-Winters told me: The pain "all passes once we cross that line."
Finally, as light left the sky, I reached the finish with a run-walk shuffle in 5:43:56, nearly two hours slower than my personal best. It would have taken the same amount of time, and felt much less painful, to fly to Iceland. But I made it. And I stayed ahead of the camels.

Texto completo: The writer, a senior Trump administration official, plans to write a book to be published this month.
The Justice Department is demanding identifying details about the senior Trump administration official who denounced the president in a New York Times Op-Ed last year under the byline Anonymous, according to a letter from a senior law enforcement official on Monday ahead of a forthcoming book by the still-unnamed writer.
Assistant Attorney General Joseph H. Hunt asked the book's publisher and the author's book agents for proof that the official never signed a nondisclosure agreement and had no access to classified information. Absent that evidence, Mr. Hunt asked that they hand over information about where the person worked in the government, and when.
"If the author is, in fact, a current or former 'senior official' in the Trump administration, publication of the book may violate that official's legal obligations under one or more nondisclosure agreements," Mr. Hunt wrote to Carol Ross of the Hachette Book Group, which is publishing Anonymous's book, and to Matt Latimer and Keith Urbahn, the agents for the former self-described senior official.
Though a Justice Department official insisted that the letter was simply part of the typical fact-finding that officials do when executive branch employees plan to write about their government service, Anonymous's representatives cast it as an effort to unmask their client, and a warning.
"Our author knows that the president is determined to unmask whistle-blowers who may be in his midst," the agents' firm, Javelin, said in a statement. The agents have represented other administration officials who wrote books but said the letter was a first.
President Trump, who has denounced the leaks that have plagued his White House and sought to keep people around him from sharing private details, has long been troubled by the existence of Anonymous, people close to him said. He said last year that he wanted the Justice Department to investigate the Op-Ed, declaring it an act of treason.
Prosecutors said at the time that such an inquiry would be inappropriate because it was likely that no laws were broken.
White House officials did not respond to an email asking whether Mr. Trump had directed the Justice Department to act. CNN first reported on Mr. Hunt's letter.
The letter immediately raised questions, even if Mr. Hunt was simply doing his job, said Chuck Rosenberg, a former United States attorney and senior F.B.I. official.
"It is obviously chilling and likely intended that way, but if the government has done it with others, it could be legitimate," Mr. Rosenberg said. "The government has an interest in enforcing nondisclosure agreements and protecting classified information. The open question here is motive."
Government employees with access to classified information are required to sign nondisclosure agreements, Mr. Hunt wrote. Previous administrations generally did not force officials to sign them unless they handled such sensitive intelligence. Legal experts say they are often unenforceable for government employees who did not handle that type of information.
But Mr. Trump long used the agreements in business as well, and has pushed to expand their use during his administration.
Officials who are allowed access to classified information must also agree to keep it secret as a condition of obtaining a security clearance to see it.
If the author's representatives could not prove that the official did not sign a nondisclosure agreement or did not have access to classified information, Mr. Hunt demanded identifying information about the person's government service.
"If you cannot make those representations, we ask that you immediately provide either the nondisclosure agreements the author signed or the dates of the author's service and the agencies where the author was employed, so that we may determine the terms of the author's nondisclosure agreements and ensure that they have been followed," Mr. Hunt wrote.
Justice Department officials were trying to determine whether the author violated a nondisclosure agreement or had access to classified information but have not decided what to do once they have gathered that information, the department official said.
The Justice Department reached out to the author's publisher and agents because it acts as the executive branch's lawyers in all legal matters.
The publication of the Op-Ed in September 2018 condemning Mr. Trump as essentially unfit for office and describing a "resistance" within the administration trying to keep the government on course set off frenzied speculation about its author. It prompted discussion within the White House at the time about using polygraph tests to determine the official's identity. Advisers dropped that idea, but the writer's identity has remained a Washington mystery.
The author's name is known to editors in the Opinion section of The Times, but not in the newsroom, which is separate.
The idea for a book grew out of the Op-Ed, and it is scheduled to be published this month. The writer plans to publish under the byline Anonymous again.
Hachette said in a statement that it was declining Mr. Hunt's requests for information. Hachette has "made a commitment of confidentiality to Anonymous and we intend to honor that commitment," the statement said.
The agents would not say whether their client has left government, but the letter was the latest in a spate of recent books by former government workers that have caught law enforcement officials' attention.
In September, the Justice Department sued Edward Snowden, the former intelligence contractor who wrote a memoir about his decision to reveal top-secret documents about National Security Agency surveillance programs. The department sued because Mr. Snowden did not submit his manuscript to the government before publication for a review for potential classified information, which is illegal to disclose. The government sought to seize the proceeds from Mr. Snowden's book.
The former F.B.I. deputy director Andrew G. McCabe did allow government officials to review his recent memoir for classified information. In it, Mr. McCabe discussed his career in the F.B.I. But he left out details about some of his most contentious moments in the days after Mr. Trump fired James B. Comey as director of the bureau, including suggestions by the deputy attorney general at the time, Rod J. Rosenstein, to wear a wire to secretly record his conversations with Mr. Trump and to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove him from office.
Katie Benner contributed reporting.

Texto completo: It may have taken a few years, but the national media are finally getting around to sort of, kind of asking questions about what Ukraine did to try to help Hillary Clinton win in 2016.
Both CNN and BuzzFeed reported over the weekend on a “conspiracy theory” that President Trump’s 2016 campaign associates have been “pushing” since the election. Both reports, however, refused to touch on the legitimate questions here.
The White House transcript of Trump's call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in July shows Trump asking Zelensky for “a favor” and telling Zelensky that he wanted him “to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine.”
It sounds very complicated because it is. And while lots of theories are floating around, it's not a conspiracy theory that Ukraine got involved in the 2016 election. The one to break the news on Ukraine’s involvement in 2016 was none other than the New York Times.
In August that year, Ukrainian prosecutors revealed that Paul Manafort, who at the time was serving as Trump’s campaign manager, may have received millions of dollars in payments from Ukrainian companies and politicians who were believed to make up a corrupt pro-Russia network.
The prosecutors, along with the Ukrainian government’s National Anti-Corruption Bureau, gave interviews and materials to the Times so it could run an extensive report on Manafort’s involvement in the matter.
Guess who was secretly investigating the Trump campaign at least one month before the Times story published? The FBI was, and we don’t really know why or who initiated that effort.
The evidence connecting Manafort to the pro-Russia ring in Ukraine is straight out of an amateur crime fiction novel. It was a diary-like accounting book that had Manafort's name handwritten inside, along with other names and monetary figures. How was it found? "In the burned-out ruins" of an office building in Kyiv, according to the guy who produced it, an anti-Russia politician in Ukraine. How did he get his hands on it? "An anonymous source," he says. (The initials of that anonymous source wouldn’t happen to be “FBI,” would they?)
In short, the FBI was covertly surveilling the Trump campaign and the Ukrainian government just happened to find a book in a burned down building that directly links Trump’s top campaign official with a bunch of shady pro-Russia money.
During all of this time, Clinton’s campaign is paying a British spy to dig up dirt on Trump by giving money to anonymous Russians, who in turn made a bunch of wild claims about Trump and prostitutes. The result is a “dossier” that ended up where? In the hands of the FBI.
This should chill every American to his or her core because that's a lot of evidence suggesting our most powerful law enforcement agency was working with a foreign country to affect the outcome of a presidential election.
Trump wasn’t asking Zelensky on the phone call about anything out of the realm of possibility. We're told that the diary that landed his campaign manager in prison literally surfaced after having been buried in ashes, and no one bats an eye. After all, a book made of paper would be the most likely thing to survive a raging fire, right? On the other hand, Trump asks the president of Ukraine to maybe give the whole thing a second look and the media accuse him of “pushing a conspiracy theory.”
Democrats want to make this impeachment about Joe Biden and “abuse of power” but it’s not. It’s about Ukraine and all of the questions unanswered about their attempt to hurt Trump in the 2016 election.

Texto completo: Have you noticed that the two parties’ fields of presidential candidates have, in the past two cycles, grown much larger (if not necessarily better in quality) than those of past years? Where parties once had two to five serious candidates to choose from, Republicans in 2016 had 17 and, by my count, Democrats this cycle have had 26.
That’s a lot for a party that had ended up holding no nomination contests at all in 1996 and 2012 and with only two serious candidates in 2000, 2008, and 2016, when no incumbent was running. Apparently, many Democratic politicos reasoned that if an oddball such as Donald Trump can get elected, why can’t she or he?
In any case, the two parties, in line with long-standing differences in their basic character, generated quite different fields of candidates in their turns.
The 16 Republicans who lost their party’s nomination to Trump were heavily tilted toward governors and large constituencies. They included 10 current or former governors, only four incumbent or former U.S. senators, and no incumbent congressmen (although four had served in the House). Only three of them — Trump, Ben Carson, and Carly Fiorina — had never won public office.
Statewide Republican victories during the Obama presidency in 2010, 2012, and 2014 had generated many Republican winners who were plausible national candidates. Six of these 16 Republicans came from the four most populous states (California, Texas, Florida, and New York), where they had won a total of 12 statewide elections — three in purple Florida. The smallest state where any of them had run was Arkansas, which ranks 33rd out of 50.
Six of the candidates came from politically marginal states and four from heavily Democratic states; only six were from safe Republican states. This was a group of candidates seasoned in competitive general elections in large constituencies.
That’s a vivid contrast with the group of 2019-2020 Democratic candidates. Of the 26 current or former candidates I’ve counted, only four come from “purple” states that have been marginal in recent presidential elections. One, former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, has dropped out to run for the Senate, and another, former Pennsylvania Rep. Joe Sestak, looks like a long shot. Conservative columnist George Will hopes that the two others, Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, will become top-tier competitors, but so far Democratic primary voters haven’t taken his wise advice. They may both be bogged down next year in a Senate impeachment trial.
The two most noticeable things about the Democratic field is that it’s heavily weighted toward those with congressional service who were elected from safe Democratic (and in some cases tiny) states. Only three served as governors: Hickenlooper and Washington’s Jay Inslee (who have already dropped out) and Steve Bullock of Montana, with its three electoral votes.
Seven of the Democratic candidates are current U.S. senators. Two are former senators: Joe Biden, elected from 1972 to 2008 in tiny Delaware, and dropout Mike Gravel, elected in 1968 and 1974 in Alaska. Another seven were or are members of the House.
Much of these candidates’ service came when Republicans were in the majority. That makes it hard for a Democrat, especially in the House, to compile a distinguished or even distinctive legislative record. I think it’s fair to say that none of them has done so, with the conspicuous exception of Biden. Democrats held majorities during most of his Senate years, but his substantive record on past issues, from busing to bankruptcy, rubs many contemporary Democrats the wrong way.
Four Democratic candidates are current or former mayors. The one from the biggest city, New York’s Bill de Blasio, dropped out after getting zero support. Julián Castro, part-time mayor of San Antonio, Texas, and Wayne Messam, mayor of Miami suburb Miramar, Florida, haven’t done much better. Only Pete Buttigieg, from tiny (101,860) South Bend, Indiana, seems like a possible contender.
Three Democratic private-sector types from California are running: hedge fund billionaire Tom Steyer, Silicon Valley denizen Andrew Yang, and motivational speaker Marianne Williamson. They may yet strike a chord in the primaries, but none of them looks well positioned to win back the blue-collar Midwesterners who spurned Hillary Clinton for Trump.

The 2016 Republican field was full of candidates who showed they could win tough general elections but weren’t so tested in Republican primaries. Most 2020 Democrats have a different problem: minimal vote-getting experience beyond the Democratic cocoon of densely packed central cities, sympathetic suburbs, and university towns. It’s a predictable problem for a party that didn’t win many offices beyond that cocoon during the Obama years.

Texto completo: DES MOINES, Iowa -- Joe Biden is facing a narrower path to win the first presidential-nominating contest, as a strengthening Pete Buttigieg threatens to cut into his support among centrist Democrats while Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders solidify their hold on the party's left wing.
A weekend of events in Iowa, capped by a raucous party fundraising dinner before 13,000 activists, offered evidence of a scrambled race for the 2020 nomination. Recent surveys in Iowa and New Hampshire, the second state in the nominating process, show the former vice president slipping even as he holds a lead in national polls.
The state with the first contest at times has been an outlier, but its results can serve as a burst of momentum for a candidate at the start of voting. During a four-day swing across Iowa, Mr. Biden said he was best-positioned to challenge President Trump next November. He made his appeal before crowds numbering in the hundreds and meeting in intimate venues, a contrast to the larger rallies held by Ms. Warren, Mr. Sanders and Mr. Buttigieg.
During Friday night's Liberty and Justice Celebration, a section of seats near the top of the arena that had been assigned to Mr. Biden's campaign was largely vacant.
A spokesman for Mr. Biden said some of the campaign's supporters were unable to use their tickets and were spread around the arena. The campaign estimated it had 1,200 ticketed supporters at the venue, comparable to other campaigns.
Mr. Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., has seen growing crowds at his events and rising support in polls that has coincided with Mr. Biden's struggles. A New York Times/Siena College poll released Friday showed Ms. Warren at 22% in the state, Mr. Sanders at 19%, Mr. Buttigieg at 18% and Mr. Biden at 17%. Many polls earlier in the fall and summer that showed Mr. Biden leading in Iowa had Mr. Buttigieg in the single digits or low teens.
Mr. Buttigieg, traveling with reporters aboard his campaign bus, said Sunday, "We all know that it's a fluid race, that it's a competitive race and that anything can happen."
Mr. Biden, in a brief interview, described the race as a "dogfight" and said he would not "take anything for granted. I've got to work like hell out here."
The Biden team is playing down his prospects in Iowa, noting that his broad support among black voters in particular will help him in places like South Carolina, which votes at the end of February.
"I think we're the only ones who don't have to win Iowa, honestly, because our strength is the fact that we have a broad and diverse coalition," said Greg Schultz, Mr. Biden's campaign manager.
Mr. Schultz said the Iowa caucuses could "have three or four or five candidates all within a couple of percentage points. Does anybody win? Technically, yes, maybe. But does that give you clarity on where the heart of the Democratic Party is? I would say, 'no.' "
Mr. Biden's team released new advertising in Iowa as part of a $4 million buy that will air through the Feb. 3 caucuses. They also noted that Mr. Biden raised $5.3 million online in October, his best month to date, after Mr. Trump tore into the former vice president over his son's overseas work in Ukraine, which has led to the Trump impeachment inquiry.
Mr. Biden's team also said he could pick up support among voters who don't view him as their first choice in Iowa, given the 15% threshold needed to qualify for delegates in individual caucus meetings. National polling, however, suggests Ms. Warren might benefit should other candidates not meet the threshold: In a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, 24% of voters named her when asked their second choice, while 15% backed Mr. Biden and 14% favored Mr. Sanders.

Warren's Top 1% Are Not All Billionaires

Texto completo: The Massachusetts senator told reporters that her plan to pay for "Medicare for all" would raise taxes only on billionaires, but that differs from the proposal she unveiled on Friday.
WASHINGTON -- When Senator Elizabeth Warren laid out her plan for "Medicare for all" on Friday, she said she would raise taxes on the top 1 percent of households to help pay for it. The middle class, she said, would not pay "one penny" more.
On Saturday night, Ms. Warren presented an even narrower description of who would face higher taxes under her plan. She told reporters that billionaires would be the only people to see their taxes go up -- a misstatement of what she had proposed a day earlier.
"It doesn't raise taxes on anybody but billionaires," Ms. Warren told reporters in Dubuque, Iowa, when asked what income bracket she defined as "middle class." She added, "And you know what? The billionaires can afford it."
Anyone with under $ 1 billion in net worth, she said, "is not paying a penny more." Asked again how she defined middle class, she repeated the assertion. "Understand this," she said. "This is no increase in taxes for anyone except billionaires. Period. Done."
But that is not what she proposed on Friday. Ms. Warren's plan for Medicare for all, which calls for $ 20.5 trillion in new federal spending over a decade, would be financed through a mix of sources, including taxes on businesses and $ 3 trillion in total from two proposals to tax wealthy Americans.
One of those measures would steepen her proposed wealth tax on net worth above $ 1 billion. But the other -- accounting for $ 2 trillion of the $ 3 trillion total -- would go far beyond billionaires. For the top 1 percent of households, Ms. Warren would increase taxes on investment gains. She would put in place a new system in which capital gains are taxed annually instead of when investments are sold, and she would raise the tax rate on capital gains to be the same as on ordinary income like wages.
Asked about Ms. Warren's comments, a spokeswoman for her campaign acknowledged that taxes would increase for the top 1 percent, but said Ms. Warren had been referring to her wealth tax proposal when she said taxes would increase only for billionaires.
The campaign of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., one of Ms. Warren's top rivals, quickly criticized her over the comments.
"The American people have to be able to trust whoever our party nominates to take on Donald Trump to be straight with them about health care," Kate Bedingfield, a deputy campaign manager for Mr. Biden, said in a statement late Saturday night. "Senator Warren said tonight that her single-payer plan won't raise taxes on anyone but billionaires, but that's simply not true."
Ms. Bedingfield argued that two other taxes proposed by Ms. Warren would also affect a broader population than just billionaires: a tax on employers that is similar to what they are currently spending on their employees' health care, and a tax on financial transactions like stock trades.
The issue of Medicare for all has been a major and escalating point of tension between Ms. Warren and Mr. Biden, and a central fault line in the Democratic presidential primary. Mr. Biden supports adding a public health insurance option that people can purchase and building on the Affordable Care Act. He has cast Ms. Warren's more expansive plan as costly and unrealistic, telling reporters in Des Moines on Saturday that "getting that plan through even a Democratic Congress would be difficult."
Ms. Warren's proposal to increase taxes on investment gains did not precisely describe how she would define the top 1 percent of households. In 2017, the top 1 percent of tax returns had income above roughly $ 515,000, according to the Internal Revenue Service -- about 1.4 million tax returns in total. Earlier this year, Forbes said there were 607 billionaires in the United States.
The other measure to tax wealthy Americans that Ms. Warren put forward on Friday would increase her proposed wealth tax on net worth above $ 1 billion to 6 percent annually, from 3 percent. (Her wealth tax also includes a 2 percent tax on net worth over $ 50 million, but that remains unchanged from what she proposed in January.)
On Sunday, speaking to reporters in Davenport, Iowa, Ms. Warren offered a broader description of who would face higher taxes under her proposal. "We ask the big corporations and the top 1 percent," she said, "to pay a little more."
Matt Flegenheimer contributed reporting from Davenport, Iowa, and Katie Glueck from Des Moines.

My Wish For Michelle Obama

Texto completo: She's too brilliant to waste her time convincing racists of black people's worth.
Michelle Obama is an extraordinary woman by any measure.
She is an attorney with degrees from Princeton and Harvard. She is the former first lady of the United States, and the first African-American one. She just came off a gangbusters book tour for her memoir, "Becoming," which was Amazon's longest No. 1 title since "Fifty Shades of Grey." And, according to polls, she is the most admired woman in the world.
She has conducted her life with the utmost honor, dignity and grace. Every day I miss her and her husband's presence in the White House. Their contrast with the Trumps is so stark that it's painful. America downgraded erudition to indecency.
Obama owes no one anything. She has nothing to prove. It is already proven.
This is why I was saddened to hear her say at the Obama Foundation Summit in Chicago that she "can't make people not afraid of black people." She continued: "I can't explain what's happening in your head, but maybe if I show up every day as a human, a good human ... maybe, just maybe, that work will pick away at the scabs of your discrimination."
Why should this brilliant black woman spend even a second of her time considering the mind-set of a racist? She shouldn't. No black person should. No person who suffers the sting of racism should.
Obama's intentions are honorable, but the approach is problematic. Anti-black racism and white supremacy are not predicated on black people's behavior. From the time Europeans started stealing people from Africa, they used pseudoscience and supposedly observed behavioral traits to justify their brutality, subjugation and exploitation.
Black people, in their eyes, were conversely brutish and savage or shiftless and lazy. They were less intellectually and culturally advanced. They lacked the morality and character to exist on the same plain as white people. White people weren't putting black people in an inferior position, God and nature had done that.
This behavioral rationale was used to justify and maintain slavery; to argue and fight against reconstruction; to justify black codes and Jim Crow; to sanction racially disparate drug policies and penalties, including mass incarceration; and, now to excuse the killings of black people by the police.
Abraham Lincoln, during the Lincoln-Douglas debates in 1858, took it even further, saying, "There is a physical difference between the white and black races which I believe will forever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality."
Black people were so submerged in this behavioral orthodoxy, that they absorbed it. They, too, started to believe that if they altered their behavior, if they better assimilated, it they rose to white people's ideals, they would mitigate white racism.
Booker T. Washington, quite famously, subscribed to this thinking. Washington was a brilliant man who dedicated his entire life for the betterment and uplifting of black people. But, he made the miscalculation of thinking that he could so demonstrate his worthiness to white people that they would self-correct their racism and reward black people with social equality and justice.
It doesn't work that way. Racism is a pathology bound up by power.
To the white racist, racism is heritage. In their worldview, white men created the modern world and advanced culture. To them, whiteness is beauty and power, it is the pinnacle of human evolution.
As such, there is nothing that a black person could do to graduate out of subordination and into equality. Our blackness itself is the mark, and it cannot be erased.
People worried during the Great Migration that blacks behaving badly would convert Northern whites into racists like their Southern brethren. In 1916, Kelly Miller, the dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at Howard University, wrote a letter to the editors of The New York Times worrying that the migrating black would "naturally enough, at first, mistake liberty for license unless he is carefully safeguarded and encouraged in the right direction."
He continued:
"Should the influx of Negro laborers to the North, without proper restriction and control, be allowed to prejudice public opinion and thus reproduce Southern proscription in the Northern states, the last state of the race would be worse than the first."
But, there were already white racists in the North. Their racism had nothing to do with black people's behavior.
Asserting that there is a behavioral cure for racism simply supports the inverse argument: that there was a behavioral cause for it. Blaming white racism on black people's behavior is an intellectual violence. It's a crime.
No one should endeavor to live their life as an exemplar for the white gaze. For the oppressed to feel any obligation to fix the flaw in the oppressor is simply another form of oppression.
Centering on the white racism perception of you is futile, distracting and corrosive.
My wish for Michelle Obama is simple: that she never again allow herself to entertain the thought of how she is being perceived by racists and whether or not that is changing any of their minds.
Why should cave men be allowed to occupy space in the mind of a super woman?

Texto completo: ALBANY – President Donald Trump is a New Yorker no more.
For decades, Trump was a symbol of Manhattan wealth and status, a real-estate developer whose name was emblazoned on buildings and face was often plastered on the tabloids.
But Trump's decision to change his legal residence from Trump Tower in Manhattan to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, means Trump will call a state other than New York home for the first time in his life.
"I cherish New York, and the people of New York, and always will, but unfortunately, despite the fact that I pay millions of dollars in city, state and local taxes each year, I have been treated very badly by the political leaders of both the city and state," Trump tweeted Thursday night.
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo wasn't buying Trump's explanation, instead theorizing that a Florida move could somehow aid him in his bid to keep his tax returns private. (They're currently the subject of a subpoena from Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance, which Trump is fighting in federal court.)
"Good riddance, Mr. Trump," Cuomo told reporters Friday in Albany.
Here's a look at some of Trump's extensive New York history:
Son of a Bronx-born developer Donald Trump's origins in the state can be traced back to when his grandparents on his father's side immigrated to New York from Germany.
Fred Trump, Donald's father, was born in the Bronx in 1905 and would go on to become a real estate developer where he made millions. He eventually married Mary Anne MacLeod, a Scottish immigrant.
The couple would go on to have five children, including the eventual 45th president of the United States.
Donald Trump is a Queens native Donald Trump was born in Jamaica Hospital in Queens on June 14, 1946.
He spent the first four years of his life living in a 2,000-square-foot home his father built in 1940 as part of the Jamaica Estates.
The family eventually moved to a larger home in the same neighborhood, according to the New York Times.
Trump went to school in Orange County When he was a teenager, Trump attended the New York Military Academy beginning in 1959.
Trump would spend the next four years at the academy in Cornwall-on-Hudson, an Orange County village about an hour north of New York City.
He graduated from the academy in 1964 and would go on to attend Fordham University where he would study business administration before transferring to the Wharton School of Business at Pennsylvania University.
Took over the Trump Organization Trump took over his father's real estate business in 1971, rebranding the business as the Trump Organization.
Trump would go on to become one of New York City's major real-estate developers, cultivating his image through frequent appearances in the pages of the city's famed tabloid newspapers.
His organization went on to develop sites big and small in Manhattan, including Trump Tower, Trump Plaza, the Commodore Hotel and the Wollman ice skating rink in Central Park.
Trump Tower opened in 1983.
The Manhattan building most associated with Trump is the Fifth Avenue skyscraper that bears his name.
Trump Tower opened in 1983, giving the future president a marquee, 58-floor building in the heart of Midtown with retail, office and residential space.
Donald and Melania Trump have a three-story penthouse home there, which served as their primary residence until last month, when they filed legal paperwork shifting their residence to Mar-a-Lago.
Trump considered running for governor In 2014, with Cuomo seeking a second term, a group of Republicans tried to woo Trump into running for governor.
Trump publicly said he would consider a run, one of his many flirtations with seeking office before he launched his 2016 presidential campaign.
He went as far as speaking at a rally against New York's SAFE Act, a series of gun control laws, outside the state Capitol, buzzing his Trump-emblazoned helicopter over the crowd on his way out of town.
But he ultimately decided against a run, blaming Westchester County Executive Rob Astorino and Republicans for failing to unify behind him. (Astorino ultimately became the GOP nominee, losing to Cuomo.)

Texto completo: STILL HERE: The Madcap, Nervy, Singular Life of Elaine Stritch by Alexandra Jacobs (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 352 pp., $27)
Broadway biographies bring with them a certain expectation of bright lights and booze, hard-edged glamour and gossip. When the subject in question is the legendary Elaine Stritch, amp those expectations up tenfold, and add in an armload of cussing. Luckily, under debut author Alexandra Jacobs' serene and critical hand, "Still Here: The Madcap, Nervy, Singular Life of Elaine Stritch" also offers vulnerability alongside vulgarity and authenticity alongside the expected avarice.
Stritch died in 2014 at 89, and spent seven decades under stage lights. Jacobs utilizes the massive cache of information the actress left in her wake, including copious interviews and her archives. This meticulous research allows for the conjuring of a surprising and complex realness that serves as a deep and resounding undercurrent to the public persona so widely known. There is nothing necessarily explosive or sensational here, though there are plenty of big names (Marlon Brando, Warren Beatty, Angela Lansbury among them); it is the way Jacobs tracks the quiet darknesses of Stritch's private life that gives this book its teeth.
Lainey, as she was nicknamed, was born in Detroit in 1925, under the tight hand of Prohibition and the height of the American car craze, the third of three sisters and daughter to a B.F. Goodrich executive. ""When Elaine was born, the chandeliers shook, and they never stopped," [her sister] Georgene became fond of saying." The same can be said for this biography, which dashes and darts from scene to scene with dizzying speed at times. Names, places and details are carried forth on the forceful flow of Stritch's energy. She seems always to be searching for the right boyfriend, acting studio, apartment, nightclub or gig, trading up as quickly as she was able, yet never attaining the recognition she craved.
Jacobs captures Stritch's ambivalent relationship with stardom early on. "Once, shut out on the porch to play and at a loss for how to amuse herself, Elaine fatally swatted enough flies to spell out her name. It was her way of supposing her name in lights," according to her friend Julie Keyes. "And that's what billing is about," Elaine told her. "Dead [expletive] flies." Doomed to a seemingly endless string of understudy, matinee or summer stock versions of coveted roles, Stritch leaned on her humor and smarts instead of looks, and increasingly used champagne and vodka stingers to self-medicate a debilitating performance anxiety.
In the chapter "From Star Maid to Bar Maid," Jacobs charts what she calls Stritch's "absolute nadir." Her drinking - on stage and off - had made Stritch a bad bet on Broadway. She was 43, and though she'd had a string of boyfriends, there was no lasting love and no children; she was in debt, her dog died, and then, "on June 22, 1969, Judy Garland's fifth husband had found Judy dead, at 47, sitting on the toilet in their London home." The death shook her. Only after Stritch's friend, Lee Israel, wrote a rousing profile of her (and her fabled alcoholism) in The New York Times, did Hal Prince, "Broadway hitmaker," call Stritch and invite her to be part of his new musical. "Company," the masterful acidic exploration of New York marriages, brought Stritch together with Sondheim, and propelled her to the next, and most powerful, act of her storied career.
Stritch often joked with her close friend and confidant, gossip columnist Dorothy Kilgallen, whether it was better for a woman to be beautiful or funny, as if those were their only options. ("Funny," Stritch reported to Kilgallen during a 3 a.m. phone call.) The power of Jacobs' biography is the way she sets Stritch's story against the canvas of a shifting century, allowing us to watch as the world expands beyond these limiting boxes for female performers, and cheer as Stritch was able to expand herself. After "Company," Jacobs observes, Stritch was finally "free of being a romantic lead, she could be a heroine." She was all along, of course. It just took the world seven decades to notice

Texto completo: Senator Elizabeth Warren and Mayor Pete Buttigieg increasingly are gaining momentum ahead of the February Iowa caucuses.
CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa -- For months, the presidential race in Iowa was a contest between two titans of the Democratic political world, each representing distinct poles of a party struggling to define its identity in the Trump era.
Now, with just three months to go before the caucuses, the ideological debate has remained the same, but the key players have shifted.
For now, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is being eclipsed by Mayor Pete Buttigieg, of South Bend, Ind., a Midwestern mayor less than half his age who has captured the energy of those looking for the party to move in a more centrist direction. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has seen much of the message that had lifted him to political fame in the 2016 primary contest co-opted by Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.
In polling, enthusiasm and organization, there is now a yawning gap between Ms. Warren, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Biden, Mr. Buttigieg and the other 13 Democrats running for president. A poll taken this week of likely caucusgoers by The New York Times and Siena College shows the top four candidates locked in a virtual tie atop the field, with the next contenders -- starting with Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, at least 13 percentage points behind.
[ The latest data and analysis to keep track of who's leading the race to be the Democratic nominee.]
Yet, in a field that once numbered two dozen, it is Ms. Warren and Mr. Buttigieg who have emerged as coveted fresh faces, riding a surge of momentum. Both have been rising for months -- Mr. Buttigieg from the obscurity of leading a community of 100,000 people and Ms. Warren from early campaign missteps highlighted by her ill-fated decision to release a DNA test designed to combat charges that she exaggerated her Native American ancestry.
With three months to go, the emergence of Ms. Warren and Mr. Buttigieg has confirmed that the race is entering a new phase, as Mr. Biden struggles to regain momentum and Mr. Sanders attempts to expand his base beyond his core supporters.
"The Sanders people are mostly the same people that were Sanders people in 2016, but there seem to be fewer of them," said JoAnn Hardy, the Democratic Party chairwoman in Cerro Gordo County, Iowa. "Some of them have moved on to other campaigns, not necessarily all to Warren. Warren has a wider supporter base than just former Bernie supporters."
Mr. Buttigieg himself declared the contest to be a "two-way race" in an interview with the Showtime television show "The Circus," a comment that irked several others in the presidential race.
"Anybody who thinks that this is a two-person race right now doesn't know Iowa," former Housing Secretary Julián Castro told reporters Saturday.
For months Mr. Biden led polls in Iowa, but he has seen his support steadily shrink as other candidates have focused their time and attention on the state.

"Some of the early Biden support was name recognition, some was familiarity, some was affection and respect," said Kurt Meyer, the Democratic Party chairman of Mitchell County, Iowa. "But much of it had to be renewed and extended, much as one would renew a thick book at the local library, for it to last until early February."
That has left many of the remaining 13 candidates scrambling for attention, relevance and desperately needed campaign dollars.
Much of the debate among the quartet of top contenders this weekend centered around Ms. Warren's long-awaited, $ 20.5 trillion proposal explaining how she would fund "Medicare for all," which she released on Friday.
Mr. Biden on Saturday bristled at Ms. Warren's suggestion that he was borrowing Republican talking points about her health care proposal, while at the same time accusing her of peddling plans that have no chance of being enacted as law.
"To say that you're a Republican or you're not loyal or you have no courage if you don't agree with such and such a position is no way to get anything passed, I promise you," Mr. Biden told reporters after speaking at a fish fry hosted by first-term Representative Abby Finkenauer. "You couldn't even get it passed. You have to be able to reach out."
For Ms. Warren, the weekend marked the beginning of a crucial stretch during which she would be compelled to sell her new plan to voters. Though not all of her supporters had familiarized themselves with the details on Saturday morning, many seemed inclined to give her the benefit of the doubt.
"She is passionate about what she's saying," said Renee Lapan-Islas, 50, who came to see Ms. Warren speak in Vinton, Iowa. "We struggle for money at times because of health care."
But Ms. Warren also faced a skeptical question from a voter with Type 1 diabetes, who expressed concern about the continuity of care under Ms. Warren's proposed transition to "Medicare for all."
"Health care is a basic human right, and we fight for basic human rights," Ms. Warren said, adding that the approach was "about strengthening America's middle class" and arguing that failing to dramatically overhaul the health care system would be calamitous over the long haul.
At the fish fry, which drew the race's seven leading candidates to a Cedar Rapids racetrack that has become a regular stop on the Democratic presidential campaign trail, the candidates parried question about rural infrastructure, river flooding and labor rights -- the sort of bread-and-butter issues Ms. Finkenauer used last year to oust a Republican incumbent.
Ms. Finkenauer's mother baked 750 cupcakes, which were heartily consumed by activists, campaign staffers and the assembled press.
Other candidates, too, recognized the new order. Mr. Biden declared Ms. Warren's health care proposal to be divisive. Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado and Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana denigrated the population of South Bend as relatively insignificant.
The weekend began with the Liberty & Justice Celebration, a party dinner seen as the last major candidate gathering before the caucuses. While 13 candidates spoke, only about half drew any kind of notable support and, of those, Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Warren were the only ones to draw thunderous applause from their speeches.
The weekend marked the latest public test of each campaign's organizational prowess. The campaigns purchase tickets for the Friday night dinner, hoping to pack the hall with their supporters.
Instead of rallying supporters for his speech, Mr. Sanders led a march that his campaign said attracted 1,500 people in the Des Moines drizzle. His aides said the campaign focused on organizing volunteers for the February caucus rather than a visible demonstration of enthusiasm inside the arena.
Mr. Biden hosted no such demonstration: Before the event began, allies of Mr. Biden quietly collected signs and noisemakers that had been placed out for supporters who never arrived.
At the end of his remarks, Mr. Biden asked the audience to "get up" and defeat President Trump.
Nearly everyone remained seated.

Texto completo: Women used to blame magazines for promoting unattainable standards. Now we blame one another. The pressure to be "real" is too much.
Recently, a friend told me she was taking a break from Instagram in part because her female co-workers reacted with snark and envy to her vacation photos. "Some of these women are haters," jealous of "the fact that I travel and do fun things," she explained. But, she added, "It's not like it hasn't come at a cost."
Of course: For every frameable photo of a woman in a vineyard, there are the undocumented vignettes of the woman at work, making money so that she can go on a trip to wine country, or arguing with her partner about whether they can afford a trip to wine country, or panicking over the credit card charges that she accumulated during a trip to wine country. The picture on social media tells only a part of the story: "I am happy today." "Here's something beautiful." "The light hit me just right."
It used to be popular to blame magazines and Victoria's Secret ads for perpetuating unattainable lifestyle and beauty standards for women. Now, with the ubiquity of social media, particularly Facebook and Instagram, everyday women are being blamed for making other women feel inadequate.
A 2018 study conducted by York University in Toronto found that young adult women using social media often compare their appearance with that of their female peers and think negative thoughts about their own bodies. A March report in Experience, an online journal published by Northeastern University, found that two-thirds of respondents experienced pangs of "social media envy" while scrolling through their feeds (most likely to provoke that envy: posts about traveling).
Wary of making their followers feel inadequate, some prominent women on social media have taken to interspersing photos of their fabulous lives (floating in the Aegean Sea, sunbathing on a yacht) with everyday footage (making dinner, rinsing with Listerine). Others have turned Instagram's caption field into a confessional, revealing their struggles with mental health and general well-being, having what The New Yorker's Carrie Battan called the "getting real" moment, sticking up a hand to say, "Hey, I'm human too!" before going back to regularly scheduled broadcasts of paid product promotions and outfit pictures.
But one woman's definition of "real" is not the same as another's. In October, a few days after giving birth to her first child, the Australian photographer Emily Yates posted a warm portrait, shot from afar, of herself breastfeeding her son. Most of the more than 200 comments were heart emojis and well wishes. But one of Ms. Yates's followers, a woman who said she was pregnant, wrote, "Not cool that you won't share your birth experience," adding that Ms. Yates had a responsibility to fans "who have been following you and supporting you for years." Ms. Yates replied, "I don't have a contract to be 'real' and tell you every detail of my life ... I am a 'real' person. This is my 'real' life. I'm a multifaceted woman with a million different hats, just like everyone else." (The comment, and Ms. Yates's reply, have since been deleted.)
This is the paradox women face on social media: Share enough highs to seem well adjusted but not braggy, share enough lows to seem down to earth but not suicidal, and share enough unfiltered moments to seem human but not unattractive.
But even if every woman posted every raw, unglamorous detail of her life, it wouldn't get to the root of the issue, which is that while social media is a great place to discover new hairstyles, recipes and memes, it's not a viable source of self-esteem, a tool for comparison or a road map to life. Also, it's opt in.
"You have the 'block' button," said Hannah Fallis Bronfman, a D.J. and wellness company founder who has more than 560,000 Instagram followers. "If I'm triggered by something, I'd rather just unfollow that person. It's the easiest way to get that toxicity out of my point of view."
Ms. Bronfman recently opened up about her struggle to conceive, part of an effort to be transparent with her followers, break up the "highlight reel" that is Instagram and "bring more context to the page." In February, she posted two photos of herself by the Eiffel Tower: one, poised, grinning, umbrella angled over her shoulder just so; the other, windblown, mouth open, umbrella jerked behind her, inside out.
"My face looks crazy, there's water everywhere," she said. "It gives people a more well-rounded look into my life so that they know that I'm real."
There's that four-letter word again. A decade ago, after a spate of Photoshopping scandals that cut out hips and trimmed arms to untenable widths, magazines began touting "unretouched" photo shoots to show that their images were "real." Serena Williams appeared unretouched on the August cover of Harper's Bazaar, wearing a glittery gold cape that billowed up to showcase her strong, glistening body. No reasonable viewer of this photo would assume that they, too, would look like this, or serve an ace like Ms. Williams, if they put on a gold cape and posed the same way. Her body reflects her status as perhaps the greatest athlete of all time. Plus, a high-powered fan was surely used to add a glamorous effect to the image. If we can see the marionette strings behind magazine images and reality television, why do we expect a greater degree of transparency from the people we see on social media?
Perhaps it's because we know some of the people in our social media feeds offline ("Her hair never looks that good at the office"). When they flaunt something we don't have, we take it as a referendum on our lives ("Oh, I'd totally have abs like that if I had time to go to the gym"). Famous people get a pass. Of course they travel to exotic places, and of course they look fabulous: they have assistants, trainers and chefs, it's their job to look attractive and conduct the sort of aspirational lives befitting glossy magazines. But if Alyssa from accounting posts a bikini pic from the Bahamas, she's vain, bragging about her ability to travel or really good at editing photos to make the whole scene look better than it actually is -- maybe all of the above.
In October, Instagram announced that it would ban from its platform filters designed to mimic plastic surgery. A billion people have used the filters in the past year, according to Facebook's augmented reality platform, Spark AR. While this may lead to Instagram's serving as a more accurate mirror of reality than a fun house version of it, the onus remains on viewers to put what they see -- whether on a screen, on a page or in three dimensions -- into context. No one should be wary of putting a pretty picture out into the world because it might make someone else feel bad.
If anyone's feelings are really that fragile, there's a solution. "A lot of people are telling me that they're limiting their time with an app that blocks Instagram after a certain number of minutes," said Ms. Bronfman.
Indeed, anyone hoping to find self-worth at the end of a scroll will be thumbing at their screen for a long time. It's probably best to look elsewhere.

LETTER FROM WASHINGTON; Happily undecided in Iowa; Caucusgoers who kick off race still mulling who should take on Trump

Texto completo: The Democrats of Iowa flooded noisily into Des Moines on Friday night as part of their unique role in choosing America's presidential nominees.
Most didn't get what they wanted.
The 13,000 who filled the local Wolves' basketball arena, and thousands more who marched in freezing rain outside, were yearning for a replay of the 2007 dinner where an upstart young senator named Barack Obama electrified Iowans and jump-started his presidential campaign.

Pete Buttigieg came close, offering an optimistic call for "hope and belonging." It was easy to see why he has surged in the polls.
Others were eloquent too, including Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris and a folksy Amy Klobuchar -- 13 candidates in all.
But lightning didn't strike, despite each campaign's efforts to summon it with crowd chants and thunder sticks. Three months before the state's Feb. 3 caucuses, Iowa's Democrats aren't ready to give their hearts away yet.
"Most people are undecided," Jim Eliason, the party chairman in Buena Vista County, told me as he dined on chicken nuggets. "They haven't settled down."
Other voters bear him out.
"I'm undecided between Joe Biden and Pete," said Denise Weiss, a bridal shop owner from Barnum. "Some of the other Democrats are a little bit too progressive for me."
"Not sure," said Isaiah Guest, a security guard in Des Moines. "Maybe Warren. Looking at the others."
Polls bear it out, too. A New York Times/Siena College survey last week found a four-way tie, with Warren, Bernie Sanders, Buttigieg and Biden tightly bunched at the top. And two-thirds of voters said they might change their minds before they caucus in the first major contest of the election season.
Iowa voters glory in this odd pre-primary period and the fact that their state -- small, rural and overwhelmingly white -- will winnow the field for the bigger contests to follow.
But they're not sure what they want, beyond a Democrat who can defeat President Trump next November.
Few use the word "electability," an invention of reporters trying to distill voters' elusive meditations into a catchphrase.
It seems more accurate to say they're looking for a moment of illumination that hasn't happened yet.
"It's impossible to know who's electable," Wendy Ewalt, who is leaning toward Warren, told me. "But who's got the personality to handle Trump? That's really important."
"My vision of this is the debate stage," said Teresa Hood, a farmer from Clare. "Who's the best one to get up there and debate Trump? I think it's Pete -- his youth, his vitality, his intelligence."
"Joe Biden tells the truth. It comes from the heart. That's why we all love him," she added. "But I worry about his stamina. I worry about the mistakes."
Ideology seems less important than attitude. In three days of conversations, I met voters who caucused for Bernie Sanders in 2016 but are now thinking about Warren, Buttigieg or entrepreneur Andrew Yang.
Iowa voters are demanding. They want to meet, or at least see, every candidate at least once. They like to be courted. They relish being undecided.
And they are changeable; they have to be. If a candidate doesn't reach 15% in a caucus, he or she is eliminated, and voters have half an hour to pick someone else. As a result, most are already thinking about potential second and third choices.
That's why so many candidates stay in the race if they can raise enough money and voter enthusiasm. Maybe someone will still catch fire.
One of the front-runners might falter, as Biden apparently is doing. "The Zombie Campaign," New York Magazine called his effort last week, unkindly but accurately.
That's why Harris, whose campaign has flatlined elsewhere, is living in Des Moines almost full time. That's why Klobuchar, a fluent Midwestern-speaker from neighboring Minnesota, is banking on Iowa to activate her moribund bid.
Anything can happen; that part of the caucus mythology is largely true.
Three months before the 2008 Democratic caucuses, Obama was in third place, behind Hillary Clinton and John Edwards. Obama won and proved unstoppable.
It wasn't unusual. Since 1972, the Democratic winner in Iowa has won the party's nomination in seven out of nine contested races.
So they marched, Iowa's Democrats, in Friday's freezing rain. They filed into their basketball arena for five marathon hours of speeches -- from not only the candidates, including some who won't be long remembered, but also their state party chairman, members of Congress, even the state auditor as he asked for contributions.
They ate Iowa pork chops and drank Iowa beer. They bragged that this was the largest gathering of Democrats anywhere until the party's national convention in Milwaukee next July.
And if lightning didn't strike, no matter. There are still three months of town halls and fish fries to hear candidates speak before the cold February evening when Iowans will caucus with their neighbors at schools and firehouses.
"We love our caucuses," retired truck driver Patrick Mitchell told me fervently as he stood with his daughter outside the arena in the rain. His vote would matter, he said, and that would make it all worthwhile.

Texto completo: Alex Delaware is on case
Regarding Jeffrey Fleishman's list of standout L.A. noir novels ["20 Essential Noir Books," Oct 20]: I was surprised that Los Angeles native Jonathan Kellerman was left off it.
He is the creative mastermind behind the Alex Delaware mystery series, begun in 1985 and continuing to this day. The books showcase both the known and unknown Los Angeles and surrounding environs.

The main character, Alex Delaware, a psychologist like Kellerman, cannily solves murders and mysteries with his longtime best friend, gay detective Milo Sturgis. The real standout is how much Kellerman interweaves Los Angeles' complicated and multilayered world in his books.
I also wanted to let you know how much we are enjoying The Times on Spectrum. Not only are the journalists on the various programs all enthusiastic and committed to showcasing as much information on the subject matter as possible but I also appreciate how they all take the time to really delve into a topic, a welcome change from the usual rushed and shallow reporting on other channels.

Put Clapton in Moz category
Regarding "A Test for Moz Fans" [Oct. 26] by Randall Roberts: Eric Clapton is lucky that "cancel culture" didn't exist in 1976 when he made the vile racist comments quoted in the article. For a man whose entire career has stemmed from borrowing the blues from African American musicians, it's unbelievable to me that this prejudiced hypocrisy didn't end his livelihood then and there. He apologized in a 2018 documentary, "Life in 12 Bars," but that it took him 42 years to admit he was wrong seems to me to be halfhearted at best.
The one good thing that did come out of this debacle was the late-1970s U.K. music movement Rock Against Racism, formed in direct response to Clapton's tirade. I can think of at least one modern country that would benefit from a revival of this movement.

Finding center in L.A. theater
Charles McNulty nailed it in his article regarding Michael Ritchie's lack of vision ["Our Local Theater Lacks Direction, Leadership," Oct. 20]. As a 40-year subscriber to the Taper, I recently relinquished my front row seats due to annual disappointments. Despite such loyal longevity, no one called me or said goodbye. It didn't matter at all.
When Gordon Davidson retired, I kept the faith that Ritchie would be a close follow to his predecessor. Alas, he has not been. It used to be based on thinking from the outside, rough theater, on its way to Broadway, if lucky, world premieres, that's how L.A. theater should be. In the last five years, there have been one or two decent choices, yet my ticket prices doubled this year.

::
I can only relate my own experience as an artist working with Center Theatre Group and its artistic director, Ritchie, on the commissioning and development of our recent show, "Soft Power," which premiered at CTG in 2018 and just opened at the Public Theater in New York. In 2014, Ritchie offered me a commission and production slot for the Mark Taper Forum, which I gratefully accepted. While commissions are nice enough, a guaranteed slot represents real faith in an artist.
Over the intervening years, my project grew in size and scope, from a "play with some songs," to gaining Jeanine Tesori as our composer, to a full musical, to realizing we would need a 23-piece orchestra. The original story also included a President Hillary Clinton character. After the 2016 election, Ritchie requested a phone conversation with Tesori, our director, Leigh Silverman, and me. The three of us fully anticipated that Ritchie would politely postpone this unwieldy, experimental project.
Instead, he suggested moving our show, then still being written, from the Taper to the larger Ahmanson, to accommodate the orchestra. My collaborators and I, who have worked in the theater for many decades, believe this to be arguably the bravest act of producing we have experienced in our careers. For me, this represents a concrete example of CTG's commitment and courage to create bold new works for L.A. and the American theater.

McNulty criticizes the Center Theatre Group, saying it prefers looking to New York than "its own back yard." He fails to note a terrific program CTG began recently to support and the Los Angeles theater community. In Block Party, productions from Los Angeles' smallest creative spaces are given encore productions in CTG's Kirk Douglas Theatre, exposing them to larger audiences. In addition, the program offers guidance to the selected companies in marketing, development, etc.

The politics of culture and TV
The Times labels Lorraine Ali a television critic. Good luck finding any television criticism in her latest anti-Trump screed ["Boos All Part of the Game," Oct. 29]. How long before she is put where she belongs -- on the Op-Ed page?

Sometimes the wrong train takes you to the right station. Frank Rich did it, Frank Bruni did it and Ali should do it more often.
Political insight shared by nonpolitical writers brings us a more expansive human context. It's what we need in this tumultuous period of our political evolution. Please, more brilliant human-scale observations.

A lesson in the use of 'bodega'
Regarding "He Found Himself at the Movies" [Oct. 23] by Jen Yamato: As a native of Los Angeles and a proud Chicana, I am perplexed when writers use the word "bodega" when referring to markets or liquor stores in this city. To people of Mexican descent, bodega means warehouse or storeroom. This should be clarified to all writers who cover stories in Los Angeles. Out here, licoreria, tienda, mercado, tianguis, abarrotes or the false cognate marketa are most commonly used. Please alert the New York Times as well; it always makes the same mistake.

String of 'pearls' on Broadway
Regarding "Calendar Feedback: Curtain Up on Proposals to Improve L.A. Theater" [Oct. 27]: A letter writer suggests building a theater district downtown. There already is such a district.
It's called the Broadway Historic Theatre District and includes a string of onetime vaudeville and full-scale dramatic houses. Some, like the Morosco (now the Globe) and the Belasco, have been beautifully restored and host live events; some have been converted for temporary retail use; and a couple, the Rialto and the 8th Street/Olympic, are now full-scale retail establishments.
I discovered this on a tour hosted by L.A. Conservancy. Take a walk down Broadway, walk past the lavishly restored theaters like the Orpheum or the Theatre at Ace Hotel (the former United Artists theater), and check out places like the Cameo, the Roxie and the Arcade (formerly the Pantages).

Texto completo: Jonathan Cahn seems to be everywhere these days.
The best-selling author has found himself on a multitude of Christian television programs in recent weeks, including on the Trinity Broadcasting Network and Daystar Television, where he has discussed his latest best-seller “The Oracle: The Jubilean Mysteries Unveiled.”
While many people may feel like the world is in disarray, falling apart and spinning out of control, Cahn said he is encouraging everyone to relax, take a deep breath and see God’s hand in current world affairs, as well as in their individual lives.
“If there’s a plan for the world,” Cahn said, “then there must also be a specific plan for each of our lives.”
Cahn, 60, has written several previous books focusing on biblical prophecy, including “The Harbinger” and “The Paradigm,” both of which also landed on best-seller lists.
“The Oracle,” published by Charisma House, has been on the New York Times Bestseller list in recent weeks, following its release on Sept. 3.
Thrilled with the book’s reception, Cahn said it is the culmination of years he has spent uncovering biblical prophecy, combined with revelations from God that shed new light on current affairs.
In a recent phone interview from his home in New Jersey, Cahn said the reception to “The Oracle” has been beyond his expectations. Just two weeks after its release, Charisma House was on the fourth reprint of the book. More than 500,000 copies were to be in print by Oct. 20.
“I’ve been blessed that every book has been a best-seller,” Cahn said. “But ‘The Oracle’ is exceeding every expectation. We were told by Publishers Weekly that it was number one. The demand has been crazy. We’ve been contacted by ministries and book dealers, and we can’t keep up with them. It’s been overwhelming.”
Cahn said “The Oracle” owes its popularity to its message, which places ancient biblical prophecies in the context of current headlines. He said the book tells the story of the mystery behind the past, the present and what is yet to come.
“It’s so big that it embraces everything from Moses to Mark Twain,” Cahn said, “from the prophet Daniel to President Donald Trump.”
Most importantly, he said, it shows that in spite of a world that often appears to be out of control, “there’s an order to it.”
“When it looks like everything is out of control,” Cahn said, “‘The Oracle’ is saying everything is very much under control.”
Cahn, a Messianic rabbi who leads the Beth Israel worship center in Wayne, N.J., said “The Oracle” had its origins about a year and a half ago, and that he ended up with about 3,000 pages of notes: “The biggest challenge was getting this into a book that’s under 300 pages.”
He said he also was given six hours on a television program to discuss “The Oracle,” but only touched on half of the book’s major themes.
He said after he handed “The Oracle” manuscript to the publisher, he took it back so he could add more details on how prophecy was relating to current events. Some of that information had to do with “an appointed word” that was first spoken in ancient Bible scriptures but had found new meanings in modern times, he said.
The mysteries included in “The Oracle” are “so precise” that they include exact dates of events that “are affecting our lives,” Cahn said.
“It’s very comforting, very encouraging for most people,” Cahn said, “and for some people who would want God to be out of the picture, it’s shocking, and that’s OK, too.”
While Cahn said he has encountered some push-back as the leader of a messianic congregation in New Jersey, he has remained resolute. Dealing with resistance is something to be expected, he said, “whenever you kind of break down a wall.”
Cahn already is casting his vision to the future, saying he is entertaining offers for his books to be presented as feature films.
And, he said, there’s always the chance for another book down the road.

Texto completo: Varias calles son cerradas anualmente durante el Maratón de Nueva York, el más popular del mundo, que atraviesa los cinco condados hasta por lo menos la media tarde del domingo.
Adicionalmente este año, la anunciada visita del mandatario Donald Trump mañana sábado a la ciudad, quedándose hasta el domingo, perfilan una complicación aún mayor en el tráfico de autos y buses.
Trump tiene previsto asistir a una pelea en Madison Square Garden el sábado, según el diario New York Times.
Cada visita suya genera cierre de calles para desplegar su comitiva y controlar posibles protestas. La de mañana será su primera estancia en Nueva York, su ciudad natal, tras anunciar anoche que, al término de su gobierno, se mudará a Florida, alegando que los políticos locales “me han tratado muy mal”.
Durante el maratón de NYC, que se celebra el primer domingo de noviembre y coincide con la entrada del horario invernal, muchas rutas de autobuses son canceladas o redireccionadas y algunas accesos al Metro son cerrados, para garantizar la seguridad de los corredores y de los miles de seguidores que los siguen desde las calles.
En Manhattan, las zonas más restringidas el domingo serán el Upper East Side, Central Park South y West, incluyendo los accesos a la Torres Trump de la 5ta Avenida.
Como es tradición, NYPD ha anunciado su estrategia de seguridad tras la reciente muerte del líder del grupo Estado Islámico (ISIS), Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi durante una redada en Siria; y además las recurrentes balaceras causadas por civiles estadounidenses, aprovechando grandes concentraciones y la venta libre de armas y municiones en muchas regiones del país.
La información más actualizada sobre el transporte posible puede consultarse aquí.
Weekend Plans: Trump is tentatively scheduled to go to NYC to attend an MMA event at Madison Square Garden on Sat night, per sources.
Stay over at Trump Tower.
Great news for traffic on NYC Marathon Sunday.

Sometimes Drug Prices Are Too Low

Texto completo: When Americans talk about drug prices, the conversation is dominated by the eye-popping sticker prices of certain new drugs. We're all aware of how sky-high prices can make it hard for some patients to afford the drugs they need. Yet few appreciate how patients also lose access to treatments when prices are too low.
The federal government's attempts to keep prices low have created a chain of unintended consequences. Start with the "best price" law of 1990, which mandated that manufacturers offer drugs to state Medicaid programs at the lowest price available to any other buyer.
The unintended -- but predictable -- consequence was to hurt many small clinics and hospitals. Drug companies often gave discounts to clinics and hospitals that treated a large number of low-income and uninsured patients, but the best-price law put them in a dilemma. They couldn't keep offering those low prices unless they did so for all of Medicaid. So manufacturers stopped the discounts, causing prices to increase by more than 30% at some hospitals and clinics.
Congress tried to compensate in 1992 with the 340B Drug Pricing Program, which mandates that manufacturers offer discounts to certain hospitals, but provides for Medicare to reimburse these hospitals for the full list price of the drugs. The hospitals love this profitable arrangement, and though Congress intended it to apply only to hospitals with a high percentage of low-income and underinsured patients, hospitals can apply for the discounts at their own discretion. This causes manufacturers to sell countless drugs well below their list price.
Hospitals and clinics have gained from these discounts, to the tune of $6 billion in 2015. Taxpayers gain nothing, because Medicare still pays the full price. And according to the New England Journal of Medicine, the discounts haven't expanded care or reduced mortality of low-income patients. Because both the 340B program and the Medicaid best price law keep prices low, drug companies underinvest in the next generation of hospital outpatient drugs.
Another set of regulations further discourages hospitals from offering some drugs. For drugs administered in a hospital setting, Medicare Part B mandates that the facility can charge an administrative fee plus 4.3% on top of the drug's "average selling price" across all manufacturers. That means that when a particular drug company raises its price, hospitals' retail price remains pegged to the industrywide average, potentially forcing them to sell the drug at a loss.
If a hospital has a drug that costs $100 and gets a few patients a day, it stocks and replenishes the drug daily, earning $4.30 plus an administration fee on each patient. That makes mild financial sense. But what if the drug costs $10,000, demand is sporadic, and the shelf life is limited? The hospital might not even stock the drug.
The fixed 4.3% margin results from the government's using its monopsony power to decide how much it will pay providers. In the drug arena, government is an 800-pound gorilla. Health-care providers and pharmaceutical companies are paying attention. The drug they don't develop and the drug you aren't administered might have been the one that got you out of the hospital a day earlier or even saved your life.
Washington also discourages drug development through its self-contradicting regulation of generics. The 1984 Hatch-Waxman Act fast-tracked the approval process for generics, yet the same law forbids manufacturers from telling doctors or customers if their generic drug is better than their competitors'. Why invest in a superior drug if you have to keep it secret?
Consider Merck's Mevacor, now sold generically as lovastatin. As long as manufacturers produce a product that meets the minimum standard to be classified lovastatin, they can market it as identical to every competitor's version. Hatch-Waxman effectively eliminates any incentive to make lovastatin better, to guarantee safety or reliability of supply, to discover new uses, or even to do something as simple as develop new tablet sizes.
Once a number of generics enter the market, profit margins decrease. Then sometimes it takes only a production problem or other small cost increase for a manufacturer to cease production. As the number of manufacturers declines, supply can slip below demand. Currently, as many as 260 drugs are unavailable or in short supply in the U.S.
The supply problem isn't new. In 2011 President Obama directed the Food and Drug Administration to resolve and prevent critical shortages of vital medicines. One administration official stated, "We can't wait anymore." Unfortunately, yes, we can.
And patients are dying. A shortage of norepinephrine in 2011 hampered hospitals' ability to treat septic shock. A study in the Journal of the American Medical Association concluded: "Patients admitted to these hospitals during times of shortage had higher in-hospital mortality."
Citing such shortages, the Federal Aviation Administration has exempted airlines from having to stock their airplanes with five key drugs. Those drugs form the core of an emergency medical kit during flights. Dr. Sherif Badawy, an expert on in-flight medical emergencies, told the New York Times "To think you could fly without epinephrine is crazy."
This is a race to the bottom. Companies that can't effectively price and promote the advantages of their products sometimes decide not to make them in the first place. Americans are being denied needed drugs because some prices are too low.

Army versus Marines as Afghanistan hero seeks to win Pennsylvania seat for GOP

Texto completo: MT. LEBANON, Pennsylvania — Army combat veteran Sean Parnell kicked off his race as a Republican running for the U.S. House here at Pamela’s Diner. It's within a stone’s throw of the district office of Rep. Conor Lamb, the Democrat he is challenging for the 17th Congressional District seat in 2020.
“My plan for today is just to tell the voters who I am, give them a sense of what I stand for, and just listen to them and figure out what they feel is important,” said Parnell before he headed off to two other diners in the district in Beaver and Butler counties in the western and northern suburbs of Pittsburgh.
The district is made up of neatly trimmed Allegheny County upper-middle-class, left-leaning suburbs such as Mt. Lebanon, working-class communities in Beaver County packed with labor families, and fiscal conservatives and enough rural and exurban Butler County voters to make the whole district a smidge Republican leaning.
Parnell spent his time talking mostly with customers but took a beeline to the kitchen before he left to talk to the cooks and servers. “I worked at Smartie Arties as a bus boy, then as a cook from the time I was 15 until I was 21. I know how hard that job is and I just want to thank them,” he said.
Parnell was born in the Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh and went to Greensburg Central Catholic High School in Westmoreland County. While attending Clarion University, he watched events unfold on 9/11 and said he felt a call to duty to join the Army. His service began in Afghanistan in 2006, commanding a platoon called "The Outlaws," who were stationed near the Pakistani border.
The experience and his bravery there earned him two Bronze Stars, one for valor, and the Purple Heart, as well as a New York Times bestseller, Outlaw Platoon, which captures in vivid detail his platoon's grueling 16 months spent engaging in endless firefights in the mountains of Paktika Province to upend the Haqqani network.
Lamb, the scion of a western Pennsylvania Democratic dynasty, is a former federal prosecutor and Marine Corps officer. He narrowly won his first race, beating Republican Rick Saccone for a seat in the 18th Congressional District in a special election in the spring of 2018.
Lamb then chose to run in the 17th Congressional District after the controversial move by the majority-Democrat state Supreme Court, which redrew all of the congressional lines in the middle of last year after it determined the seats were politically drawn to favor Republicans, only to turn around and redraw them to favor Democrats.
The next race pitted two incumbents against each other, Lamb and Republican Keith Rothfus, who lost the seat to Lamb by a whopping 12 percentage points last November.
Before Parnell’s surprise jump in, Lamb was considered to have an easy glide to the finish line next year. No one expected House Republicans to be able to recruit a quality candidate to run in any of the swing districts that the GOP lost last year that placed them in the wilderness, let alone one in western Pennsylvania.
Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato’s Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics, said the Army Ranger’s entrance into the race is a good development for the GOP, “I think this makes the district more competitive than it was prior to Parnell entering the race.”
Kondik moved the race from ‘Safe Democrat’ to ‘Likely Democrat’ the night before Parnell’s announcement.
In 2018, Lamb was the center of the Democratic universe, and he raised $8.99 million in the Democratic Party’s effort to shine national attention on GOP vulnerabilities and hand Trump a House loss. Since January of this year, Lamb has raised $740,000 and has $563,000 cash on hand.
As a candidate, Lamb ran on a moderating message and avoided any support for impeachment. He benefited largely from union family support, something his Republican opponents were unable to capitalize on in the same way that President Trump did when he won the district by 2.5 percentage points.
On Thursday, Lamb cast a yes vote for an impeachment inquiry of the president.
Since the beginning of the 116th Congress, Lamb has voted over 90% of the time against legislation backed by Trump, which is probably why Trump publicly urged Parnell to challenge Lamb when he was speaking at the Shale Insight conference in Pittsburgh last week.
“It looks like PA 17 is going to have a true race in 2020,” said Jeff Brauer, political science professor at Keystone State University.
“This race very well could become a bellwether race that will draw national interest and attention,” he said.
In short, if Parnell is ahead or closing in on Lamb for the western Pennsylvania seat, then Trump will likely win the Keystone State at the top of the ticket. Democratic presidential candidates cannot win Pennsylvania without western Pennsylvania support, and they cannot win the presidency without Pennsylvania.
Brauer notes that in Lamb’s first two victories, he positioned himself as a moderate in an area in which Trump garnered and maintains significant support. “Lamb avoided running against Trump as much as possible, and he even claimed that he liked Trump. However, since taking office, Lamb's actions and voting record have been to the contrary, as he has been a highly reliable Democratic vote for the House majority,” Brauer said.
This past week, Lamb voted with the Democrats on a Republican effort to prevent future presidents from banning fracking, a game-changing economic driver in western Pennsylvania.
“This time Lamb will be running against a peer," said Brauer. “In his first two elections, he ran against older, less charismatic opponents with whom he was able to easily draw a contrast. Parnell is also a young, charismatic millennial, as well as a veteran."
Brauer said Parnell can also run as a Washington outsider, as he has not run for office before. “Therefore, he can contrast himself to the Lamb family political dynasty. In many ways, Lamb will meet his match with Parnell,” he said.
Brauer said 2020 turnout will also be a different animal than a midterm turnout. “This will be Lamb's first election during a presidential year. Special election turnouts are generally low, and midterm election turnouts are usually in the 40% range, though 49% in 2018 was on the higher side than usual, while presidential elections draw in the mid-50s to lower 60s.”
A higher turnout with an incumbent president of the opposite party who had previously won the state and the district at the top of the ticket will likely hurt Lamb's chances and bolster Parnell's, said Brauer. “With all that said, Lamb still will have the advantages of incumbency, as well as a district that was made more Democratic with the court-drawn map,” he said.
Salena Zito is the author, with Brad Todd, of The Great Revolt: Inside the Populist Coalition Reshaping American Politics. Todd is a campaign strategist for Parnell.

Texto completo: Un Dreamer lucha para frenar la deportación de su madre, una paciente de cáncer en etapa cuatro.
De acuerdo con New York Times, la hondureña Tania Romero se encuentra bajo custodia de ICE después de ser detenida en el tráfico en el condado de Gwinnett en Georgia . La mujer tenía orden de deportación desde 2008 por no asistir a sus audiencias en una orden de inmigración.
Sin embargo, su hijo Cristian Padilla Romero probó que la mujer de 48 años nunca recibió las citaciones. Los sobres fueron devueltos a ICE por el Servicio Postal del Estados Unidos .
El joven es un estudiante de doctorado en la prestigiosa Universidad de Yale. Desde allí ha promovido una campaña para frenar la deportación de su madre y costear los gastos médicos de su tratamiento para el cáncer oral.
Relacionado: Pequeño detalle lo salvó de la deportación y le dio la residencia. Pero ahora le pedían $100,000
“Me guió, trabajó en tres empleos para mantenerme”, dijo Padilla, quien llegó a Estados Unidos a los siete años, al Times. “Mi madre es la principal razón por la que voy a Yale”.
El inmigrante, que también es indocumentado pero protegido por el DACA, también ha denunciado que su madre no ha recibido la atención médica que su madre requiere en este momento.
Romero cruzó la frontera ilegalmente hace unos 20 años . Ha trabajado limpiando casas, lavando platos y en construcción.
ICE dijo al Times que por privacidad no puede hablar del caso.
La campaña en GoFundMe para ayudar a los Romero la puedes encontrar aquí.

Texto completo: From " Trump, Zuckerberg & Pals Are Breaking America ," Thomas Friedman, New York Times, Oct. 30:
Look at Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, who was questioned last Wednesday at a House hearing by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. A.O.C. was trying to grasp why Zuckerberg thinks it's O.K. for politicians to run political ads that contain obvious lies. . . .
This is all about money for Zuckerberg, but he disguises his motives in some half-baked theory about freedom of the press.
From the New York Times " Advertising Acceptability Manual ":
We believe that the broad principles of freedom of the press confer on us an obligation to keep our advertising columns open to all points of view. Therefore, The New York Times accepts advertisements in which groups or individuals comment on public or controversial issues. We make no judgments on an advertiser's arguments, factual assertions or conclusions. . . . We do not verify, nor do we vouch for, statements of purported fact in advocacy/opinion advertisements. We reserve the right, however, to require documentation of factual claims when it is deemed necessary. . . .
Our stance with regard to the acceptance of political advertisements is the same as it is for the acceptance of opinion advertisements.

Texto completo: The push to allow married men to serve as priests isn't progress. It's another form of misogyny.
The modern Catholic Church is beset with serious problems. Among them is that not enough men want to be priests. Over the past three weeks, 184 bishops gathered at a Vatican summit to seek solutions for the Amazon region in particular, singled out because of myriad crises it is facing, including environmental devastation, violence and a shortage of priests to serve the needs of the faithful there.
The bishops' solution: Do anything other than ordaining women as priests.
On Oct. 26, in a "revolutionary" decision, the bishops gathered at the Vatican voted 128 to 41 to allow an exception to what has essentially been a 1,000-year ban on the ordination of married men as priests. They recommended this change for only certain parts of the Amazon and for only married men already made deacons, meaning men already allowed to perform marriages and baptisms, but not to officiate at mass, which only priests can do. It is now for Pope Francis to decide whether the decision goes forward.
It is surprising in many ways that the bishops made this decision. Allowing a married man to be a priest violates several longstanding rules. They voted as they did despite the tremendous importance of chastity for the Catholic Church and the old idea that sexual activity is a pollutant that cannot be allowed near the holy ritual of the mass. They voted in favor of married priests despite a longstanding fear that for a priest to have a wife and a family would lead to serious conflicts of interest. There is a legend that the word "nepotism" was invented in honor of the grasping nephews of popes who sought and obtained more than they deserved thanks to their powerful uncles (and "nephews" we can sometimes see as a euphemism for "sons").
These potential conflicts of interest and other dangers that family influence and obligations bring, therefore, are something Catholic authorities have long recognized and have eagerly sought to prevent. They voted as they did despite the symbolic importance, too, of the idea that a priest be united to only one spouse, the Church, just as Jesus Christ was united in an exclusive bond with the Church.
All of that paled in comparison to letting a woman, even a celibate woman, act as priest.
To be sure, there are good doctrinal reasons for this, if one wants to find them. According to the laws of the Catholic Church, known as canon law, that priests might marry or not is man-made law, therefore mutable, while the exclusion of women is divinely ordained. But the priesthood itself is a man-made invention, an amalgam of Judeo-Roman and other traditions, refined and also only rather belatedly attached to the mass, a ritual performance that re-enacts and celebrates the most important tenets of Catholic faith.
Pope Francis himself has acknowledged that there could be what the theology professor Gary Macy has called a "hidden history" in which women had a larger role in ministry than the Catholic Church currently accepts, for which scholars such as Dr. Macy have found ample and intriguing evidence. While rejecting much of this evidence, conservative Catholic authorities do, however, recognize that for several centuries, their predecessors, like the leaders of the Eastern Churches then and now, allowed married men to serve as priests or as bishops, though sometimes they required celibacy and that their wives enter religious life.
The medieval requirement that a priest abstain from sex and from marriage probably made it harder to find men willing to serve from the first moments it was mandated, though willingness to turn a blind eye when priests engaged in same-sex relations, kept mistresses and committed sexual assault may have helped. Even so, we know that there were shortages, for bishops complained then, just as they are doing now.
The solutions they proposed, however, were never that women be ordained. Instead, they sought and obtained permission to ordain men born out of wedlock, men convicted of serious crimes, converts and men who did not meet the age requirements or educational requirements. Indeed, Catholic authorities have often proved willing to bend on a wide range of criteria. A sticking point has been that a candidate to the priesthood must have male genitalia (or at least have been born with them). Even men with "imperfect" genitalia, as long as they presented as male, or if castrated, could prove that it was done accidentally, could be ordained with special permission. As Western Christianity spread to the Americas, Africa and the East, it was allowed that indigenous men could be ordained, despite considerable and growing racial prejudice.
But no women. Never that.
In subsequent centuries, other variants of Christianity have found the ministry of married men, sexually active men and women acceptable. The Roman Catholic Church has not.
And however much Pope Francis and this group of bishops promise to recognize and even reconsider the role of women in Catholic ministry, their actions so far fall short. In a final bitter twist, before the most recent Vatican summit, a large contingent of religious women -- modern-day suffragists -- had sought the right to vote at the summit. They were denied.
This kind of misogyny, of course, is more than just the Catholic Church's problem. It is one of the many crosses that the uncomfortable heirs of the Western tradition must bear.
We should hesitate, though, before we blame the Middle Ages for this. At that time it was thought the right order of things that men and women had distinct gendered roles and that social inequality and hierarchy were the best ways to keep the world in order. We who know better should do better.

Texto completo: In 1962, he became the first black candidate elected to the State Senate since Reconstruction. But his influence extended farther, as Muhammad Ali found out.
Leroy R. Johnson, a prominent Georgia politician who in 1962 became the first black candidate elected to that state's Senate since Reconstruction, died on Oct. 24 in Atlanta. He was 91.
The Willie A. Watkins Funeral Home in Atlanta said he died in hospice care at the Atlanta Medical Center.
Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms of Atlanta said in a statement that Mr. Johnson's "formidable presence in the Georgia Senate, two years before the signing of the Voting Rights Act, put equality into play in Southern politics."
Mr. Johnson was an important figure not only in Georgia but also beyond. In a 1970 article in The New York Times Magazine, the journalist Stephan Lesher, after rattling off the names Julian Bond, the Rev. Ralph Abernathy, Coretta Scott King and Charles Evers, said that "among those who earn their bread in and around politics, one Southern black leader stands a head taller than the rest -- a relatively obscure 42-year-old Georgia state senator named Leroy R. Johnson."
In his ability to deliver blocs of votes, cut deals with political enemies and promote the interests of black Georgians, Mr. Lesher wrote, Mr. Johnson was "without peer in Southern black politics." And even though the candidate he backed in the Democratic primary for governor that year had lost, the article noted, Mr. Johnson was such a force that "the victorious nominee, Jimmy Carter, put out peace feelers to Johnson even before the balloting."
Mr. Johnson's influence extended beyond politics. After Muhammad Ali refused to be inducted into the armed forces in 1967, he was stripped of his heavyweight title and barred from boxing. City after city tried to engineer Ali's return to the ring, but because the issue was so polarizing, none could manage it -- until, in 1970, Mr. Johnson pulled enough strings to arrange for Ali to fight Jerry Quarry at the Atlanta Municipal Auditorium (a fight Ali won).
It was perilous territory; Mr. Johnson received death threats and was given police protection in the weeks before the fight. But the effort won him accolades. At the fight, he was introduced to the cheering crowd and a large television audience as the man who had made the event possible.
Leroy Reginald Johnson was born on July 28, 1928, in Atlanta to Leroy and Elizabeth Heard Johnson. He grew up in Atlanta, seeing segregation at every turn -- a fact of life, he said, that he didn't really think much about until after he had graduated from the all-black Booker T. Washington High School and enrolled at Morehouse College, an all-male black institution.
"I had almost accepted segregation without realizing that I had done so," Mr. Johnson said in an oral history recorded in 2007 for the Richard B. Russell Library for Political Research and Studies at the University of Georgia. "I had accepted segregation as a matter of course."
As an example, he cited one of his favorite activities: going to the movies at a segregated theater that required him and other black people to use a separate entrance and sit in the balcony. An address to students by Morehouse's president, Benjamin E. Mays, in Mr. Johnson's first week on campus changed all that.
"He said, 'Morehouse men must never, ever pay for segregation,"' Mr. Johnson recalled, "'because segregation robs you of your dignity."'
Dr. Mays, he said, specifically condemned going to segregated theaters, saying that the very act of paying for an inferior seat accessed through a separate entrance was in effect an admission that white people were better than black people.
"I thought that Dr. Mays was talking directly to me," Mr. Johnson said. He added, "That was the defining moment of my life."
Mr. Johnson earned a master's degree in 1951 at Atlanta University (now Clark Atlanta University) and taught social science in the Atlanta school system before earning a law degree at North Carolina Central University in 1957. Such were the times that he made headlines later that year when Paul Webb, Fulton County's solicitor general, appointed him as a crime investigator, breaking the color barrier. Mr. Webb found himself having to explain that he thought "a Negro investigator might get more information out of Negro citizens."
Court rulings in the early 1960s broke down election practices that had restricted the power of urban voters, especially black urban voters, in Georgia, and Mr. Johnson saw an opportunity. He got an early start on the 1962 election as well as some smart advice from advisers, including that he stop smoking his beloved cigars in public.
"They told him that cigars blurred his image and made him 'look' like a politician," Ebony magazine wrote in a 1963 article about him. "And more -- cigars, the advisers said, reminded white people of Negro politicians of the Reconstruction era." He switched to cigarettes and cigarillos.
He was elected, becoming the first black state senator since 1870 and the first in either of Georgia's two legislative chambers since 1907.
At first he was ostracized.
"There were those who really thought that because I was present the ceiling would fall and the seats would crumble," he said in the oral history. "They thought that, and for the first some 40 days that I was there not one senator spoke to me, except those who were in my delegation from Atlanta."
But then one day near the end of that first session, he was late for a committee meeting, and by the time he arrived, a vote on a particular bill had already been taken and had come out a tie. When he walked into the committee room, he was suddenly very popular with colleagues on both sides of the issue.
"They ran over to me and said, 'Senator, I need your vote,"' he recalled. "And I stood there and I wondered to myself, 'What happened to my blackness?' All of a sudden what they saw was not a black senator walking in the room; they saw a vote."
"After that," he added, "it seemed that the ice had broken."
He was sometimes accused of cozying up to white politicians, even segregationist ones. To Mr. Johnson, though, deal-making was part of opening doors.
"Most of my enemies are guilty of Reconstruction thinking," he told The Times in 1970. "They think that a politician, especially a black politician, only does something when you cross his palm with silver. What they don't understand is that when I support a man for an office, I want entry to that office, not money."
He added: "I want the power that comes from picking up that phone and seeing a governor or a mayor when I want to,. I want to influence policy, I want to get blacks into key jobs, and yes, I want a voice in deciding who those blacks will be."
Mr. Johnson ran unsuccessfully for mayor of Atlanta in 1973, and in 1974 he was defeated in his bid for re-election to the Senate. At the time, he was facing tax-evasion charges; he was acquitted but convicted of a lesser charge, providing a false affidavit to the Internal Revenue Service.He is survived by his wife, Dr. Cleopatra Johnson; three granddaughters; and a great-granddaughter. A son, Michael, died in 2016. Mr. Johnson's body was to lie in state at the Georgia State Capitol on Thursday, with a funeral on Friday, the funeral home said.
From the beginning of his political career, Mr. Johnson was keenly aware of his role as a groundbreaker.
"When I taught history and citizenship," he was quoted as saying by Ebony in 1963, "I could never point out with any real enthusiasm the possibilities of citizenship for my students. Now, a Negro boy or girl can aspire to be not only a senator but governor of this state."
On Thursday, Stacey Abrams, who in 2018 narrowly missed becoming Georgia's first black governor, said on Twitter: "He created opportunities for others in politics & beyond its reach. I was honored to know him."

Texto completo: President Trump is nearing a milestone in his push to overhaul the federal judiciary with conservative judges. If the Senate confirms a batch of nominees now working their way through the approval process, a quarter of the nation's 179 appeals court judges -- those sitting just below the Supreme Court -- will be appointees of Mr. Trump.
That number is far higher than the number of appointees to the appeals court that either George W. Bush or Barack Obama had made at this point in their presidencies.
The Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to vote Thursday on advancing a group of nominees, including several to the appeals court. But in a break from most other nominees over the past two and a half years, two of them do not have uniform support among Republicans.
Votes on Steven J. Menashi, a White House lawyer being considered for the Second Circuit Court of Appeals based in New York, and Halil Suleyman Ozerden, a federal judge in Mississippi nominated for the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals based in New Orleans, had been delayed.
Both men received ratings of "well qualified" from the American Bar Association, but Democrats and some Republicans have raised concerns about Mr. Menashi's writings about women, L.G.B.T.Q. issues and diversity, as well as his reluctance to answer questions about his work in the Trump administration.
Last week, Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine -- whose support of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh was instrumental in his confirmation to the Supreme Court -- announced that she would oppose Mr. Menashi's confirmation. Mr. Menashi, 40, also does not have the support of either of his home-state senators, both Democrats, Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York.
Some Republicans have called Judge Ozerden, who is 52 and was appointed to the Federal District Court by President George W. Bush in 2007, insufficiently conservative. Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, has objected to a 2012 decision by Judge Ozerden that dismissed a challenge by a Roman Catholic diocese to the Affordable Care Act's requirement that insurance plans cover contraception. On Wednesday, Mr. Cruz's office confirmed that he planned to oppose Judge Ozerden's confirmation, while Judge Ozerden's home-state senators from Mississippi, both Republicans, have said they would support it.
Some Democrats, including Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, have suggested they may vote for Judge Ozerden, though Mr. Durbin's office declined to comment on Wednesday.
Ms. Collins has questioned if Mr. Menashi, a former law clerk to Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., has the proper temperament for the bench, pointing to a provocative paper trail.
As an undergraduate at Dartmouth College, where he was a writer and the editor in chief of The Dartmouth Review, Mr. Menashi criticized women's marches against sexual assault, arguing they discriminated broadly against men. He compared the gathering of race data by colleges to Nazi Germany's Nuremberg laws; called animal-rights activists "by and large, a contemptible bunch"; and defended a fraternity's themed "ghetto party," to which a white student had worn an Afro, calling it "harmless and ultimately unimportant."
As an editorial board member for the New York Sun newspaper, Mr. Menashi helped write a piece praising Christian students for persuading their university to allow a religious group on campus to bar gay people from becoming officers. In a 1998 Op-Ed for The New York Times, he argued against need-based financial aid at educational institutions, saying it "punishes families with the foresight and prudence to save." In a book review in 2002, he advanced the myth that John J. Pershing, an American general in World War I, had executed Muslim prisoners using bullets dipped in pig fat. And in a 2010 law review article that has drawn particular attention, Mr. Menashi defended ethnic homogeneity in the context of Israel.
Mr. Menashi, who submitted more than 900 pages of supplementary material to the Senate Judiciary Committee, has expressed regret "if some of the writing was overheated or extreme," and he has sought to draw a distinction between his thinking before and after law school. He graduated from Stanford's law school in 2008.
The White House did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday about either nominee.
At a nomination hearing last month, Mr. Menashi said that the religious persecution his Jewish family had faced had helped shape his views. "My family illustrates the need and importance of America's tradition of religious tolerance and diversity," he said. "I abhor discrimination."
Some of Mr. Menashi's detractors have pointed to the legacy of the seat he would fill, which once belonged to Thurgood Marshall, the first black justice on the Supreme Court and a pillar of the civil rights movement. They have also pointed to the centrality of the Second Circuit to a number of legal matters concerning the president himself. The court has considered President Trump's potential immunity from criminal investigation while in office and whether the president can block people from following his Twitter account without violating the First Amendment.
Mr. Menashi's nomination has moved at an especially fast pace, having been made only last month. He is the second lawyer working in the White House Counsel's Office to be nominated; Greg Katsas, former deputy counsel and deputy assistant to the president, was confirmed to the federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., in late 2017.
Democrats and Republicans pressed Mr. Menashi at a hearing last month to be more forthright about his work for the Trump administration. Senator Lindsey Graham, the Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, called on him to answer yes-or-no questions, which he declined to do, citing lawyer-client privilege.
All nominees to be considered Thursday, including seven to district courts, were rated "well qualified" except Sarah E. Pitlyk, a nominee to the Eastern District of Missouri whom the American Bar Association deemed unqualified based on a lack of trial or litigation experience.
The 157 judicial appointments that Mr. Trump has made are roughly on par with the total made at this point in their first terms by President George W. Bush and President Bill Clinton. Mr. Trump's prioritization of the federal appeals courts, however, sets him apart from his predecessors.

Texto completo: Mr. Witherspoon, who started out as a stand-up comedian, was best known for his role as Ice Cube's father in the "Friday" franchise. He was also seen on "The Wayans Bros." and many other TV shows.
John Witherspoon, an actor and comedian who was best known for his role in the "Friday" movie franchise and also seen on television series including "The Wayans Bros." and "The Tracy Morgan Show," died on Tuesday at his home in Sherman Oaks, Calif. He was 77.
His family announced the death on his Twitter account.
"Life won't be as funny without him," said Ice Cube, who starred with him in the "Friday" movies.
Mr. Witherspoon started out as a stand-up comic at the Comedy Store in Los Angeles in 1974. Mitzi Shore, the owner, made him an M.C. It was a period when other future stars were also starting out there.
"I M.C.'d the second show," he recalled last year in a video interview with DJ Vlad. "Dave Letterman M.C.'d the first show."
Decades later, he would be a guest on Mr. Letterman's late-night show more than 20 times.
His experience as an M.C. proved useful in 1980, when he played one in the remake of "The Jazz Singer," starring Neil Diamond. It was Mr. Witherspoon's first film role.
He had appeared in assorted other movies and numerous television shows when the original "Friday" was released in 1995. In that film, a raunchy comedy that became a surprise hit, he played Willie Jones, the father of Ice Cube's slacker character, Craig. Willie was, among other things, prone to dispensing fatherly advice while using the bathroom.
He reprised the character in 2000 in "Next Friday," and again in 2002 in "Friday After Next."
"Witherspoon is often on hand to remind an audience that no matter how crass a movie is, it can always, always be crasser," Wesley Morris, now with The New York Times, wrote in reviewing the third film for The Boston Globe. "Here he's dithering and frail, which gives his blue comedy a touching Redd Foxx lilt."
He had been expected to play the character once again in a final installment, "Last Friday," now in the planning stages.
Mr. Witherspoon was born on Jan. 27, 1942, in Detroit, one of 11 children. As he told the story, local officials were somewhat indifferent to accurate record-keeping -- some of the children were listed in birth records with the name Witherspoon, others with Weatherspoon.
"I'm a Witherspoon," he told DJ Vlad, "but I think I might have been a Weatherspoon in the beginning."
He was temporarily living with a brother and sister-in-law when he became interested in acting -- they were part of an acting group that met weekly, and he was motivated to sign up for some lessons himself. His acting teacher asked him if he would perform in an annual comedy show he was involved in. Although Mr. Witherspoon had done no comedy at that point, he recalled, "I went there and stole the show."
He tried unsuccessfully to break into comedy in Las Vegas, then went to Los Angeles and began performing at open-mic nights at the Comedy Store. He also worked the door there before his move to M.C.
Within a few years he was getting small roles on TV as well. One of his earliest credits was on a 1979 episode of the crime drama "Barnaby Jones." He played a counselor at a camp for teenagers with drug problems; one of the teenagers was played by a young unknown named Sean Penn.
In an April 2019 Netflix interview, Mr. Witherspoon said he had been paid $ 5,000 for the first "Friday" film, $ 400,000 for the second and "over a million" for the third.
On those films and in his television work, he was known for ad-libbing.
"When I was on 'The Tracy Morgan Show,"' he told DJ Vlad, "they said, 'Mr. Witherspoon, you've got to stick to the script.' I said, 'Man, this stuff ain't funny."'
Among his more recent television credits were "The First Family," "black-ish" and the Adult Swim shows "The Boondocks" (an animated series on which he voiced the character Robert Freeman) and "Black Jesus."
His survivors include his wife, Angela, and two sons, JD and Alexander.
Mr. Witherspoon was still playing comedy dates until a few months ago. "If I hit the lotto, I would be nowhere near the road," he told The St. Louis Post-Dispatch in 2017. "But I got bills to pay."
He described himself as a hustler, someone willing to scramble to make a buck. He had a YouTube channel where he posted videos called "Cookin' for Poor People," in which he would prepare dishes like Poor Man's Gumbo and Meatloaf Surprise. He introduced the bits with the catchphrase "Because when you're hungry, everything tastes good."
He once tried a line of humorous greeting cards.
"I saw a lady on 'Oprah' once who had greeting cards with a dog on it," he told The Bay State Banner in 2011. "I figured, I look better than that dog. I can do that.
"But apparently I don't. I ain't making no money off them damn cards. They're too bizarre."

Texto completo: The family of a woman killed in the Aug. 3 Walmart mass shooting filed a lawsuit against the suspected shooter, his family and the website where he is believed to have posted a racist, hate-filled manifesto minutes before allegedly killing 22 people.
The lawsuit was filed Tuesday in El Paso district court and is the first lawsuit to be filed against the parents and grandparents of the suspected shooter Patrick Crusius, 21, or the 8chan anonymous online message board, said El Paso attorney James Scherr, who is representing the family of Angelina Englisbee.
"The (Englisbee) family seeks this lawsuit to stop the hate, to send a message to people who are going to travel 600 miles or 1 mile to injure, maim or kill someone because of their national origin, their background, their religion, whatever the case may be, just because they live hate," Scherr said.
In addition to John Bryan Crusius, Lori Lynn Crusius, Larry P. Brown and Cynthia B. Brown, the suit names three individuals and companies associated with 8chan as responsible for Crusius' actions Aug. 3.
These individuals include James A. Watkins of Sagle, Idaho, who does business as Pacific Internet Exchange, LLC and N T Technology, Inc.; Matthew Prince of San Francisco, who is co-founder and chief executive officer of Cloudflare Inc.; and Frederick Brennan of Atlantic City, New Jersey, according to the original petition filed Tuesday.
Police believe alleged shooter posted manifesto to 8chan Brennan started 8chan in 2013 and stopped working with Watkins, the site's current owner in 2018, according to The New York Times. The site was shut down Aug. 4 after its service provider Cloudflare decided to stop working with it in the wake of the shooting.
The petition alleges that Patrick Crusius, Brennan, Watkins, Prince and Cloudflare "publically [sic] and privately encouraged, promoted, incited, encouraged and inspired 'white racist nationalism', 'nationalism', 'Nazism', and ideological racist fervor, as an unincorporated association, to unite together to fight this 'invasion' of minorities, particularly persons of Hispanic descent."
El Paso police believe Crusius posted a four page-long hate-filled rant to 8chan at 10:15 a.m. Aug. 3 that railed against an "invasion" by immigrants to the United States and a political takeover of Texas.
The petition also names "John Does 1 through Unknown" as defendants, and Scherr said he has subpoenaed Crusius' computer and cellphone so he can identify who Crusius was in communication with leading up to the shooting and who may have helped Crusius travel from Allen, Texas, to El Paso. The attorney said he anticipates subpoenaing 8chan for evidence.
While the petition seeks a jury trial to determine whether the defendants are liable for damages amounting to more than $1 million, Scherr said the case is not one the Englisbee family is "looking at trying to settle or get money out of."
"We're trying to set a new standard that those people can lose everything financially they have that is attachable to them by law if they are going to do this type of activity," Scherr said.
This also includes the families of mass shooters he said, noting "many times, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree."
The petition states Crusius' parents and grandparents, with whom he was living at the time of the shooting, were negligent "in fostering an environment which encouraged hate crimes" and "in allowing weapons in the home where Crusius resides, despite knowing of his dangerous propensities."
Chris Ayres, the Dallas-based attorney representing the Crusius family, said he did not have a comment at this time on Tuesday's lawsuit.
In an Aug. 6 statement to the Wall Street Journal, John and Lori Crusius said their son's actions "were apparently influenced and informed by people we do not know, and from ideas and beliefs we do not accept or condone."
Family thought shooting victim would have 'lived to be 100' 86-year-old Angelina Englisbee, who was known as "Angie" to family and friends, drove herself to Walmart Aug. 3 to buy food and school supplies for her grandchildren, her family said.
"We thought she would have lived to be 100," said her daughter, Edith Hallberg. "I wanted her picture on the news, (that said) 'shout out to Angie Englisbee, she's 100 today,' and that's not going to happen. It's just too sad."
Englisbee had seven children, 25 grandchildren and 15 great-grandchildren. Her son, William Englisbee, described his mother — who everyone affectionately called "Mom" — as the family's rock.
His hope is that families of the other victims will join their lawsuit, he said.
"Hate is not something that we're born with," William Englisbee said. "It festered and brewed inside this guy somehow, someway. He came to El Paso with a lot of malice, a lot of evil, the intent to hurt, and my mom was in the way and murdered.
"I just want it to stop."

Texto completo: ProPublica announced Wednesday that Allen Tan will be joining its staff as its newest editorial experience designer. He starts on Nov. 11 and will be part of ProPublica’s Design and Platform teams, working to evolve the overall reader experience and core editorial products.
Tan comes from the American Civil Liberties Union, where he led the redesign of key parts of aclu.org and created an online tool showing voting deadlines and key positions on the ballot. His team also worked on public education initiatives for redistricting and electoral reform, immigrant family separation and mass incarceration.
Before that, Tan worked for five years at The New York Times on teams that redesigned its homepage and article layouts, modernized its website typography, and overhauled its editorial approach to push notifications.
“Allen is a gifted designer and collaborator, with a genuine eye for editorial work,” said David Sleight, ProPublica’s design director. “We can’t wait to start collaborating with him to build out our growing design systems and editorial platform.”
“It’s amazing to see ProPublica’s newsroom operate with such fearlessness and ingenuity,” Tan said. “I’m excited to join the team and help elevate everything it produces.”

Iconic steakhouse Peter Luger gets zero stars from New York Times

Texto completo: In his zero-star review of iconic New York steakhouse Peter Luger, New York Times food writer Pete Wells said “after I’ve paid, there is the unshakable sense that I’ve been scammed.”
Wells castigates the restaurant, complaining both of terrible service — “The management seems to go out of its way to make things inconvenient” — and terrible food.
“The shrimp cocktail has always tasted like cold latex dipped in ketchup and horseradish. The steak sauce has always tasted like the same ketchup and horseradish fortified by corn syrup,” Wells wrote. “Was the Caesar salad always so drippy, the croutons always straight out of a bag, the grated cheese always so white and rubbery?”
Responding to the blistering review, Peter Luger co-owner Judy Storch said “We know who we are and have always been. The best steak you can eat. Not the latest kale salad,” as the New York Post reported.
Storch said “reviewers and their whims have changed,” and Wells notes a two-star review from Times writer Frank Bruni in 2007.
The restaurant has, for some, become synonymous with steak in New York City. It opened its doors underneath the Williamsburg Bridge in 1887 as “Carl Luger’s Café, Billiards and Bowling Alley,” according to the restaurant’s website.
In her response to Wells, Storch noted the restaurant’s history and reputation: “Lugers has always focused on doing one thing exceptionally well — serving the highest quality of steak — with a member of our family buying every piece of USDA Prime beef individually, just as we have done for decades.”
But Wells takes issue with the steak, too.
“What gnaws at me every time I eat a Luger porterhouse is the realization that it’s just another steak, and far from the best New York has to offer,” he wrote.
The review acknowledges the restaurant’s history — “compared to Peter Luger,” Wells wrote, other steakhouses “don’t count” — but he concludes that the list of reasons to avoid Peter Luger is a long one.
“You start to wonder who really needs to go to Peter Luger, and start to think the answer is nobody.”

Facebook and Trump were made for each other but not for democracy Z on TV

Texto completo: Did you know that while Joe Biden was vice president, he promised Ukraine $1 billion in U.S. aid if it would fire a prosecutor investigating a company that was paying Mr. Biden's son to sit on its board?
Had you heard that Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham was backing the Green New Deal championed by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other Democrats whom President Donald Trump has labeled socialists?
Neither is true. But you wouldn't necessarily know that if you saw ads on Facebook trumpeting such lies. And founder Mark Zuckerberg has made it clear in hearings and statements in recent weeks that he has no intention whatsoever of helping Facebook's millions of U.S. subscribers determine what is true and what is false in ads on his platform during the 2020 presidential campaign, which is already well on its way with candidates having spent more than $60 million in ads on Facebook and Google.
At that pace, such spending is sure to surpass the $80 million spent in 2016, the bulk of it from Mr. Trump's campaign. And that doesn't count the tens of millions spent by foreign countries and other groups to spread disinformation, propaganda, conspiracy theories and lies.
The last month has been filled with news about Facebook and its unwillingness to police itself, to act with any shred of the kind of editorial accountability demanded of broadcasters since the Communications Act of 1934.
Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren has been blasting away at Mr. Zuckerberg and Facebook on the campaign trail for the decision to carry ads like the one cited at the start of this column from the Trump campaign lying about Mr. Biden and an alleged billion-dollar payoff in connection with his son.
(There is no evidence of wrongdoing by Mr. Biden in connection with his son Hunter, who sat on the board of the Ukrainian energy firm, which is one of the reasons CNN refused to air the ad.)
"Facebook holds incredible power to affect elections and our national debate. They've decided to let political figures lie to you - even about Facebook itself - while their executives and their investors get even richer off the ads containing these lies," Sen. Warren wrote in one of several tweets.
"If Trump tries to lie in a TV ad, most networks will refuse to air it," she wrote in another. "But Facebook just cashes Trump's checks."
Sen. Warren has vowed to break up big tech firms like Facebook. Mr. Zuckerberg, in remarks made to his employees, has vowed to fight her tooth and nail with a "major lawsuit" if she tries.
Rep. Ocasio-Cortez has also become a very public critic of Mr. Zuckerberg over his unwillingness to take down political ads that contain lies. Last week, she confronted him at a congressional hearing asking him pointedly what it would take for him to remove political ads that contained material that had been shown to be false.
The core of his dissembling answer: Facebook will not remove a politician's speech even if it is clearly false.
The false Facebook ad alleging that Sen. Graham backed the Green New Deal was posted in the wake of that exchange by a political action committee named The Really Online Lefty League to test, highlight and possibly mock Facebook's policy on political lies.
The ad was taken down Saturday with Facebook saying it will take down lies from political groups but not from politicians.
It is not just politicians and groups on the left that have called out Facebook for the way its policies imperil democracy.
The New York Times reported Monday that more than 250 Facebook employees signed a letter to Mr. Zuckerberg protesting his decision to let politicians lie in ads on the platform. The letter says Mr. Zuckerberg's decision "allows politicians to weaponize our platform by targeting people who believe that content posted by political figures is trustworthy."
And yet, for all of the criticism, outrage and documentation of disinformation that Facebook has published in the last three years, nothing has changed for the better since 2016. In fact, things are worse: The biggest liar in the history of the American presidency has the largest media platform in the history of the world to spread his propaganda, misinformation, lies, innuendo, smears and conspiracy theories as we plunge deeper into the 2020 race. And you wonder why our information ecosystem is so polluted - and we are such a confused and agitated country.
Early in 2018, I wrote a column asking how close we were going to skate to the edge of losing our democracy before we decided to regulate social media platforms like Facebook.
If this isn't the edge, it's more than close enough for me.

Texto completo: A 'Hippie' Anthem
DETROIT, 1968
Jose Feliciano
Ernie Harwell (below), the late Hall of Fame broadcaster and a songwriter himself, recommended to Tigers' management that Jose Feliciano (above), a 23-year-old musician from Puerto Rico, sing the "The Star-Spangled Banner" before Game 5 of the 1968 World Series. What happened next was an unconventional rendition of the song. As Victor Mather of The New York Times wrote in 2017: "Feliciano went on the field with his guide dog and an acoustic guitar. He was quite free with the song's melody, giving it a slower folk tempo and adding extra syllables and different stresses. What resulted was an anthem that to today's ears is mellow and expressive. Many ears in 1968 heard it differently. Boos were heard from the stands, but the real blowup came afterward." The rendition was called a "disgrace" and "sounded like a hippie was singing it," said some fans. Mather writes that the players were divided. "I don't think it was the proper place for that kind of treatment," said Roger Maris of the St. Louis Cardinals. But his teammate Tim McCarver said: "Why not that way? People go through a routine when they play the anthem. They stand up and yawn and almost fall asleep. This way, at least they listened." Feliciano returned to Detroit in 2010 to sing the anthem again -- to honor Harwell, who had recently died. Feliciano wasn't booed.
New York, Let's Reintroduce You to the Commissioner's Trophy
When the Mets last hoisted the World Series trophy, Ronald Reagan was president, Ed Koch was mayor, Mario Cuomo (some things don't change) was governor and Cyndi Lauper's "True Colors" topped the pop chart. It's been 33 years since Keith Hernandez, Gary Carter (above) and their teammates received a ticker-tape parade and a trip to City Hall. It's been 10 years for the Yankees, the same year Barack Obama was sworn in for his first term. According to Investopedia.com, baseball's Commissioner's Trophy is worth $ 19,500, more than the N.B.A.'s Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy ( $ 13,500) and less than the N.F.L.'s Vince Lombardi Trophy ( $ 50,000). The Stanley Cup gets the trophy for most valuable -- $ 650,000.
......................................................................................................................
THERE WAS AN EARLIER TROPHY ... Prior to the first World Series in 1903, Major League Baseball had other trophies to commemorate different league championships. Among them, the Dauvray Cup (named after the actress Helen Dauvray) and the Temple Cup. ......................................................................................................................
... THEN THERE WASN'T A TROPHY ... There was no trophy from 1903 to 1966. ......................................................................................................................
... UNTIL 1967 ... The trophy was first awarded to the St. Louis Cardinals in 1967 when they beat the Boston Red Sox. (The Yankees have won the most -- seven). ......................................................................................................................
... AND IT WAS GIVEN A NEW NAME. The official title of the World Series trophy was changed to "The Commissioner's Trophy" in 1985. ......................................................................................................................
WHAT'S IT MADE OF? The trophy is 2 feet tall and weighs 30 pounds. It has 30 gold-plated flags -- one for each Major League team -- grouped around a silver baseball that contains 24-karat gold vermeil stitches. ......................................................................................................................
SHINY AND NEW Unlike the Stanley Cup, a new Commissioner's Trophy is created each year. ......................................................................................................................
THE YANKEES GOT A FRESH ONE The trophy was redesigned by Tiffany & Co. in 1999. The 2000 Yankees received the first newly designed trophy for beating the Mets in the Subway Series. Since 1997, if the home team wins, the trophy is presented on the field.

Big Number
36%
The champions earn 36 percent of the money doled out after the Series is over. Last year, the Boston Red Sox split a record $ 31.7 million. The runner-up, the Los Angeles Dodgers, split $ 21.2 million (24 percent). The league championship series runners-up get 12 percent each. The division series runners-up (4), 3.2 percent each. The wild-card runners-up (2), 1.5 percent each. The players of each club decide who gets a share of their team's winnings.
Employee of the Month
HARD TO CHOOSE, SO THREE WON
The first time the award went to more than one player was in 1981, when the Dodgers beat the Yankees in six games. Steve Yeager was a co-winner with Ron Cey and Pedro Guerrero. The three combined for five home runs, 17 runs batted in, 18 hits and a .327 average. ......................................................................................................................
A PAIR OF ACES
The only other time there were co-winners was in 2001, when Randy Johnson and Curt Schilling of the Arizona Diamondbacks led their team to a sevengame victory over the Yankees. Johnson was 3-0 with a 1.04 E.R.A. in 17⅓ innings and Schilling won one game with a 1.69 E.R.A. in 21⅓ innings. ......................................................................................................................
CONSOLATION PRIZE
Bobby Richardson of the 1960 Yankees is the only player in to be named M.V.P. despite being on the losing team (Pittsburgh won the Series). He hit .367 with 12 R.B.I., including a grand slam. He drove in six runs in Game 3. Richardson hit one home run in the regular season, with a .252 average.
REPEAT PERFORMANCE
Three players have won the award twice: Sandy Koufax, Dodgers, in 1963 and 1965; Bob Gibson, Cardinals, in 1964 and 1967; and Reggie Jackson with the A's in 1973 and with the Yankees in 1977. Koufax, below with catcher John Roseboro in 1963 after the Dodgers swept the Yankees, pitched two complete games in that Series.
Even the Greats Don't Always Win
Some of the greatest players have never won (or appeared in) the World Series. Here's a look at the careers of two Hall of Fame players -- one who made it to the Series and one who never did.

His Tigers made it to three Series in a row (1907-09), but lost them all -- (Chicago Cubs twice, Pittsburgh Pirates). Cobb had an amazing 24-year career, mostly with the Tigers. He retired with a .366 career average and 4,189 hits. He struck out over 50 times only once, when he was 20. Cobb's achievements include: M.V.P., the Triple Crown and 12 batting titles. But he hit a pedestrian .262 in three Series.
TWINS, ANGELS
Rod Carew, First base, Second base
A career .328 hitter, Rod Carew had 3,053 hits in 19 seasons. He was Rookie of the Year, M.V.P., won seven batting titles and made 18 All-Star games. But he had no luck in the postseason. His Twins and Angels made it the A.L.C.S. four times, both lost them all. Carew batted only .220 in 14 games.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: A documentary about the Bronx airs on HBO. And a Canadian sketch-comedy show returns on IFC.
What's on TV
THE BRONX, USA (2019) 9 p.m. on HBO. "Ahh, that's the sound I used to sleep to," the show business manager George Shapiro says in this documentary. He's walking down a street in the Bronx with a Brooklyn Dodgers cap on his head and a smile across his face. The soothing sound he's talking about? It's the clang of an aboveground subway. Shapiro, who grew up in the Bronx in the 1930s and '40s and went on to have a storied career working with comedians like Jerry Seinfeld and Carl Reiner, hosts this love letter to the Bronx, which collects interviews about the borough with a number of its famous natives. Among them are Reiner, the actor Alan Alda, the author and photographer Arlene Alda (Alan Alda's wife), the hip-hop artist Melle Mel, the singer-songwriter Melissa Manchester, the graffiti artist John Matos and the former Secretary of State Colin L. Powell. The documentary also includes interviews with members of DeWitt Clinton High School's class of 2017, who graduated 68 years after Shapiro did. They speak to recent changes in the Bronx and to the borough's enduring character.
THE KING'S SPEECH (2010) 11:05 p.m. on Flix. On Wednesday night in New York, the Swiss conductor Philippe Jordan will take the stage at Lincoln Center to conduct the New York Philharmonic in Beethoven's Symphony No. 7. A few hours later, TV audiences will have an opportunity to hear some of that symphony played during the climax of this acclaimed drama. The music comes as Colin Firth's King George VI delivers his famous declaration of war; the plot that precedes that moment follows the eventual king as he works to cope with a stutter, aided by a speech therapist played by Geoffrey Rush. The film won an Academy Award for best picture.
BARONESS VON SKETCH SHOW 12 a.m. (Thursday) on IFC. The fourth season of this Canadian comedy show includes sketches built around a vegan last meal, a scrunchie and an airplane middle-seat. It debuts at midnight with a pair of half-hour episodes.
What's Streaming
DAVE CHAPPELLE: STICKS & STONES (2019) Stream on Netflix. Dave Chappelle was honored with the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington on Sunday, an award considered the top honor in comedy. The ceremony put the cap on a busy several months for the comedian: He made his Broadway debut in July. In August, he released this Netflix special, in which he touches on, among other subjects, condemnation he has received for some of his recent material -- including comments about transgender people in two 2017 specials. "This man was out of shape two and three years ago," Wesley Morris said in a recent episode of The New York Times's "Still Processing" podcast, "and he's gotten himself back into good stand-up shape, great stand-up shape, I would say. But the sins of those three years are still with him in this special, and the residue of that other work is there."

G.M. Strike to Cost Nearly $3 Billion in 2019 Earnings, Company Says

Texto completo: General Motors has offered its first accounting of the financial toll from a six-week strike. And its preview of the months ahead reflected why it was willing to endure the walkout.
The four-year union contract approved last week to end the strike allowed the company to close three plants already idled in the United States. Its third-quarter earnings report, released Tuesday, showed the importance of that provision: G.M., like other automakers, faces worsening economic conditions, especially in the United States and China, the two largest auto markets.
The company said the 40-day strike cost $ 1 billion in the quarter, reducing earnings by 52 cents a share. A bigger blow is coming in the fourth quarter, which lost a full month of production. For the year, G.M. said the strike's impact on earnings was likely to be about $ 3 billion.
[ How it looked in Flint: The G.M. strike from the picket lines .]
"The lost profits from the work stoppage were significant," G.M.'s chief executive, Mary T. Barra, said in a conference call. She said G.M. would be able to make up only a small part of its lost production over the rest of the year because many plants were already operating at full capacity and could not accommodate extra overtime or weekend work.
The new contract with the United Auto Workers union allows the company to close a small-car plant in Lordstown, Ohio, and transmission factories in Baltimore, Md., and Warren, Mich. The reduction in manufacturing capacity will leave G.M. more stable if sales continue to slow or the United States economy slips into a recession.
"They've lost a lot of profit this year because of the strike, but now they have the company in a better position," said David Whiston, an analyst at Morningstar. "If they had done nothing and kept the plants open, they wouldn't address the excess capacity they have in the U.S."
The third-quarter report outlined some of the reasons for caution. So far this year, the company's vehicle sales have fallen slightly and total industry sales are likely to decline in 2020, said G.M.'s chief financial officer, Dhivya Suryadevara.
In China, G.M.'s sales fell 11 percent in the third quarter, which caused a decline in income from joint ventures there. Over all, G.M.'s international operations booked a loss of $ 65 million in the third quarter.
Ms. Suryadevara said the company expected "continued volatility" in China and South America next year.
G.M. also has to control costs because it is spending heavily to develop electric and self-driving cars. In the conference call, Ms. Barra said the automaker was likely to spend more on electric vehicles over the next five years than on gasoline-powered vehicles. The company's autonomous-vehicle division, Cruise, lost $ 300 million in the third quarter.
[ G.M. on Monday sided with the Trump administration in its clash with California over pollution standards .]
In exchange for an agreement to close plants, the new labor contract gives G.M.'s 49,000 U.A.W. workers pay increases over the next four years, including substantial jumps for about a third of its hourly workers who currently earn considerably less than the top wage of $ 31. After four years, most hourly workers will earn the new top wage of $ 32.
Analysts estimate that the contract will increase G.M.'s labor costs by about $ 100 million a year. Ms. Barra said G.M. aimed to cut costs to increase productivity to ease the impact of the higher labor costs. "I have asked the G.M. team to find every offset," she said.
G.M. shares gained more than 4 percent in Tuesday's trading.
The U.A.W. now has to reach deals with Ford Motor and Fiat Chrysler, and it will seek to win similar terms, an approach known as pattern bargaining. It is unclear whether those automakers will agree to the same terms or what they would seek in return, since neither has domestic plants designated for closure.
G.M. reported third-quarter net income of $ 2.3 billion, down 9 percent from $ 2.5 billion in the same period in 2018. The decline reflected the impact of the strike, which halted production in the final two weeks of the quarter, as well as a loss by overseas operations and higher warranty costs.
On an adjusted basis, the company earned $ 1.72 per share in the quarter, which ended Sept. 30, compared with $ 1.87 per share in the same quarter last year. Revenue declined to $ 35.5 billion from $ 35.8 billion.
The company's union employees walked off the job on Sept. 16, idling 34 plants across the Midwest and South. Most of G.M.'s plants in Mexico and Canada were affected as well. Workers began returning to their jobs over the weekend.
"Our new labor agreement maintains our competitiveness, preserves our operating flexibility and allows us to continue improving our quality and productivity," Ms. Barra said. "We remain focused on strengthening our core business and leading in the future of personal mobility."
Helped by strong sales of high-margin trucks and sport utility vehicles, G.M. has earned $ 35 billion in North America over the last three years. Under the new labor agreement, the company has promised to invest $ 7.7 billion over the next four years in United States plants. An additional $ 1.3 billion will be invested by G.M. and joint-venture partners. The spending is supposed to create or preserve as many as 9,000 jobs.
In first three quarters of 2019, G.M. sold 2.15 million cars and light trucks in the United States, a decline of about 1 percent from the comparable period last year.

Texto completo: One reader says "you betcha!," the president absolutely deserved it, while another worries that it just increases partisan animosity.
To the Editor:
Re "Trump Got Booed. Can I Smile?," by Jennifer Weiner (Op-Ed, Oct. 29):
Donald Trump has upset me almost every day for the last three years. It continues even though I mute the television every time he begins to speak. And now he is scaring me, too. So did I revel in seeing the look on his face when he was booed at Sunday's World Series game? You betcha! The "lock him up" chant may have been a bridge too far, but did he deserve it? Absolutely.
What about the millions of people in this country and others who have been injured directly or indirectly by his words and actions? He has no concern for anyone but himself. Ever. Revenge is a dish best served cold. For me, seeing Donald Trump impeached, convicted and ending up in federal prison for his many crimes would definitely do it.

To the Editor:
As much as Jennifer Weiner may relish the schadenfreude of seeing President Trump treated as nastily as he treats others, such rancorous attitudes will only hurt American democracy.
For one thing, Mr. Trump and his supporters will just hit back harder. "Hate begets hate; violence begets violence; toughness begets a greater toughness," as the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said. Incivility is not a sound election strategy, but a recipe for partisan animosity.
For another, as the author rightly points out, the president's critics debase themselves when they stoop to his level. By appropriating his taunts of "lock her up," they become the person whom they despise.
President Barack Obama had the right idea in 2016 when he told the Democratic National Convention how to deal with Mr. Trump: "Don't boo. Vote."

Nézet-Séguin Expands His Role at Met Opera

Texto completo: The Metropolitan Opera's new music director will lead its prestigious training program, which is recovering from a scandal with his predecessor.
The conductor Yannick Nézet-Séguin, who became the music director of the Metropolitan Opera last season, said on Friday that he had decided to take on a larger role nurturing its next generation of talent by leading the company's prestigious young artist program.
"This is really the natural extension of my role in the house," said Mr. Nézet-Séguin, now the artistic director of the Lindemann Young Artist Development Program.
Since its was founded in 1980, the program has trained a number of major artists, including Dawn Upshaw, Aprile Millo, Sondra Radvanovsky and Christine Goerke. A number of its more recent graduates have emerged as house favorites in recent years in roles big and small.
The program also figured in the recent scandal involving James Levine, the Met's former music director. Mr. Levine established the program and oversaw it for decades; he had planned to continue leading it when he stepped down as music director in 2016 to take an emeritus position.
But Mr. Levine was fired in 2018 after the company said it had found evidence that he had "engaged in sexually abusive and harassing conduct towards vulnerable artists." In court papers, the Met accused Mr. Levine of inappropriately touching one of the young artists, and of trying to set up a tryst in his dressing room "to engage in sexual activity." Mr. Levine's lawyers denied the accusations. The dueling lawsuits between Mr. Levine and the Met were quietly settled this summer.
Mr. Nézet-Séguin said that while he did not want to comment specifically on "any individual cases," he was consciously working on "a re-evaluation of what it is to be in power, and what is the correct way to foster a culture where everybody feels that they are respected and that they can develop."
And he gave a hint of some of what he would be looking to foster in young singers -- including individuality.
"I've done a lot of auditions, and obviously had a lot of casting discussions with my colleagues at the Met, and sometimes we're finding that maybe young singers, it seems that they want to fit a mold that's all already prepared," he said. "And it seems sometimes that maybe at some point in their development, they've shut down their own personality."
"Actually, it's quite the contrary that I want for the operatic culture," he added. "I think what the audience wants to hear is true personalities, people who actually have something very individualized to say, and have recognizable voices -- and don't necessarily fit in a mold."

Texto completo: Views of the economy are starkly split along partisan lines, and have barely budged as growth has slowed. That could make the economy matter less in 2020 than in past elections.
Americans' views of the economy have become so hardened along partisan lines that the economy may matter less in next year's presidential election than in the past.
Both major political parties have emphasized the economy in the early stages of the campaign. Republicans hope that a rock-bottom unemployment rate and rising wages will cause voters to stick with President Trump despite the various scandals enveloping his administration. Democrats believe high levels of income inequality and fears of a looming recession will make voters willing to consider a new direction.
Surveys suggest that those arguments are resonating -- but only with voters already inclined to agree with them. Republicans consistently say the economy is doing well and give Mr. Trump strong marks for his stewardship. Democrats are much more pessimistic, and, to the extent they do believe the economy is strong, doubt that Mr. Trump deserves much credit.
And notably, neither group's views have shifted much in response to changing economic conditions. Earlier this month, for example, 71 percent of Republicans said they expected business conditions to be "very" or "somewhat" good over the next year, compared with just 15 percent of Democrats who said so, according to a survey conducted for The New York Times by the online research platform SurveyMonkey. Those numbers are virtually unchanged from two years ago, before trade tensions and other factors began to drag down the manufacturing sector and weaken the broader economy.
Economic conditions have historically been among the best predictors of presidential elections, and models based on those patterns suggest that Mr. Trump would be favored to win re-election if the economy remains more or less on its current path through Election Day.
But it is unclear whether historical lessons hold in an era of heightened partisanship.
"The predictive power of the economy is weakening as polarization increases," said Amber Wichowsky, a political scientist at Marquette University who has studied how economic issues affect voters' political views. "Partisans have a strong desire to interpret the economy in a way that benefits their 'team."'
[ From The Upshot: It's a big week for new indicators of the economy's health, and the readings could help shape the campaign dialogue .]
Franklin Fullerton works in sales for a conveyor-belt manufacturer outside Charlotte, N.C. David Kugler is a materials manager for a packaging manufacturer near Allentown, Pa. The two men, both participants in the Times survey, are close in age -- 61 and 58 -- and say they are financially stable. But they have very different political views, and very different views of the economy.
Mr. Fullerton, who usually votes for Democrats, said business had slowed since last year. His company imports many of its parts, he said, and it has had to raise prices to cover the cost of tariffs, in some cases by as much as 15 percent. He said that he did not yet see evidence of a recession, but that he was watching warily.
"I would think twice about doing any major home renovation or anything, probably," he said. "It enters your mind, whereas last year it wouldn't really have entered your mind."
Mr. Kugler's company has also been affected by tariffs. But he said that business over all remained strong, and that the local economy had improved since Mr. Trump took office. And Mr. Kugler, a conservative Republican, said Mr. Trump's trade policies were worth any short-term cost.
"It's hard sometimes, but for the long haul I think it's the right thing to do," he said. "What China's doing to us is just outright criminal."
Mr. Kugler said the economy was the most important issue to him, and said he would consider rethinking his support for Mr. Trump if conditions soured -- he just doesn't expect that to happen. Mr. Fullerton, too, said he tried to evaluate evidence objectively, though he acknowledged that his political views probably affected his interpretation.
"I'm sure I'm human, and I probably don't always see both sides of everything," Mr. Fullerton said. "I think I'm guilty of it. But I try to be aware of it."
The partisan divide in consumer confidence is a relatively new phenomenon. In the early 1980s, Democrats and Republicans largely saw eye to eye on the state of the economy, according to the University of Michigan's long-running survey of consumer sentiment. By the 2000s, a gap had emerged, with partisans tending to view the economy more positively when their preferred party was in power. The gulf has only widened since.
"They're seeing everything through the partisan lens right now," said Laura Wronski, a research scientist for SurveyMonkey. She noted that the partisanship dwarfed even factors likely to have a bigger impact on people's financial well-being, like education, income and employment status.
Partisanship hasn't completely drowned out economic reality. Measures of consumer confidence have ebbed a bit over the past year, as tariffs and other factors have led to slower growth. And confidence dipped more substantially in January, when the partial government shutdown temporarily idled hundreds of thousands of federal workers, and again when recession fears dominated headlines in late summer. In both cases, however, confidence quickly rebounded.
Economists and political scientists say an outright recession would almost certainly erode consumers' confidence, regardless of their political views. But the current economy leaves enough room for interpretation. Republicans can point to the low unemployment rate and strong stock market. Democrats can point to slower hiring and a weakening manufacturing sector.
"You could see how different people who aren't experts could look at the economy and reach different conclusions based on their partisanship," said Peter K. Enns, who leads the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research at Cornell University.
One group of voters is less likely to view the economy through a partisan lens: independents. Only about 15 percent of registered voters report being independents without a preference for either party, but they could prove decisive in next year's election. Their assessment of the economy hasn't moved much during Mr. Trump's term, either, but their views have generally been closer to those of Democrats than of Republicans.
"Independents seem to register the onset of a recession more quickly," he said. "If independents are leaning closer to Democrats on the pessimism side, that bodes poorly for Trump."
Scott Baughan, an independent voter and self-described moderate in Detroit, said he had mixed feelings about Mr. Trump's economic stewardship. He said the 2017 tax law had helped the economy, but he criticized it for not doing more to help the middle class. He said Mr. Trump was right to get tough on China, but said he didn't think the tariffs had been executed effectively.
"It's not exactly what I'd call a coherent strategy," he said.
Mr. Baughan, a 27-year-old medical student, didn't vote for either major-party candidate in 2016 and hasn't decided how he will vote in 2020. The economy will be one factor in his decision, he said, but right now it isn't pushing him strongly in either direction. He dismissed the claims of Trump supporters who say the economy is the best it's ever been, and those of critics who have been predicting a recession for months. He compared Democrats and Republicans to two people each looking through one lens of a pair of 3-D glasses.
"Each side is seeing half the picture and completely unaware that the other half exists," he said.
About the survey: The data in this article came from an online survey of 2,701 adults conducted by the polling firm SurveyMonkey from Oct. 7 to Oct. 13. The company selected respondents at random from the nearly three million people who take surveys on its platform each day. Responses were weighted to match the demographic profile of the population of the United States. The survey has a modeled error estimate (similar to a margin of error in a standard telephone poll) of plus or minus three percentage points, so differences of less than that amount are statistically insignificant.

Texto completo: El teniente coronel Alexander Vindman , principal experto en Ucrania para el Consejo de Seguridad Nacional, testificó este martes ante los representantes encargados de la investigación previa a al juicio político del presidente Donald Trump. Su testimonio no gustó al mandatario pero reveló información que puede ser clave para que los demócratas sigan adelante con un proceso que puede sacar a Trump de la Casa Blanca.
Vindman estuvo en la llamada telefónica que el presidente hizo el 25 de julio a su homólogo ucraniano y que llevó a la presidenta de la Cámara de Representantes, Nancy Pelosi, a anunciar el inicio de una consulta que reuniera los apoyos necesarios para someter a Trump a un impeachment. En dicha conversación, tal y como confirmó el coronel en su testimonio, Trump presionó a su homólogo ucraniano para que investigara a su rival político Joe Biden y a su hijo Hunter.
Vindman aseguró a los legisladores que la transcripción de la llamada que publicó la Casa Blanca había excluido la palabra “Burisma” , la compañía de gas ucraniana por la que Trump quiere que investiguen a los Biden. En la transcripción tampoco aparece las palabras de Trump afirmando que había grabaciones de Biden .
The New York Times publicó en la tarde del martes que Vindman ofreció correcciones pero las rechazaron. Según sus declaraciones, el excombatiente en Irak no comprendió por qué hicieron unos cambios y no otros.
Su testimonio supuso la quinta confirmación hasta ahora de que Trump condicionó o bien una reunión con Zelenski o bien la entrega de ayuda militar a Ucrania a una investigación de sus rivales políticos, un tema que podría espolear un proceso de destitución del presidente.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - The U.S. government said Monday that it is extending protections for more than 200,000 citizens of El Salvador who have been living in the country under temporary protected status, in a boost for Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele.
U.S. Ambassador Ronald Johnson, appearing in a video with Bukele, said that agreement "extends the (temporary protected status) for Salvadorans who are in the United States for one more year."
Later, Ken Cuccinelli, acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, appeared to contradict the ambassador, saying via Twitter that the actual TPS program for Salvadorans wasn't being extended in legal terms: "That's not what happened."
The effect, however, appeared to be essentially the same: Salvadorans who have been living in the U.S. under the TPS program - safe from deportation and allowed to work legally - will continue to do so for at least a year after courts resolve a challenge to the Trump administration's attempt to end TPS for El Salvador and several other countries.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that Salvadorans with TPS will have the validity of their work permits extended through Jan. 4, 2021.
"This is recognition of the achievements and good work of the government of Nayib Bukele," Johnson said.
The DHS statement said there was concern that "the sudden inflow of 250,000 individuals to El Salvador could spark another mass migration to the U.S. and reinvigorate the crisis at the southern border."
Man arrested in Texas shooting that left 2 dead, 12 hurt at party
GREENVILLE, Texas - A man suspected of opening fire at an off-campus college party in Texas, killing two people and injuring 12 others, was arrested Monday.
Brandon Ray Gonzales, 23, of Greenville, was taken into custody less than 48 hours after Saturday's shooting, Hunt County Sheriff Randy Meeks said. Gonzales, who was arrested at the auto dealership where he worked, was booked into the Hunt County jail on a charge of capital murder of multiple persons. Bond was set at $1 million.
The shooting happened around midnight Saturday outside Greenville, 15 miles southwest of a satellite campus of the Texas A&M University System. Authorities believe the shooter may have been targeting one person at the party of about 750 people, and that others may have been shot at random, Meeks has said.
Air Force's mystery space plane lands, ends 2-year mission
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. - The Air Force's mystery space plane is back on Earth after a record-breaking two-year mission.
The X-37B landed at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida early Sunday. The Air Force is mum about what the plane did in orbit after launching aboard a SpaceX rocket in 2017. The 780-day mission sets an endurance record for the reusable vehicle.
It looks like a space shuttle but is one-fourth the size at 29 feet.
Officials say this latest mission successfully completed its objectives.
This was the fifth spaceflight by a vehicle of this sort. No. 6 is planned next year from Cape Canaveral. According to Air Force Secretary Barbara Barrett, "Each successive mission advances our nation's space capabilities."
Pope declares Secret Archive of Vatican not so secret anymore
VATICAN CITY - Pope Francis has declared that the Vatican Secret Archive isn't so secret after all.
Francis on Monday officially changed the name of the Holy See archive to remove what he said were the "negative" connotations of having "secret" in its name.
From now on, the vast trove of documents, manuscripts and papyrus of popes past will be officially known as the "Vatican Apostolic Archive."
In a new law, Francis noted that the archive has long been open to scholars.
He said the name change better reflects the archive's reality and "its service to the church and the world of culture."
The archive contains the documentation on the life of the universal Catholic Church from the eighth century to the present.
Students join Iraq protests as clashes kill 3
BAGHDAD - Thousands of students joined Iraq's anti-government protests Monday, as clashes with security forces firing tear gas canisters killed at least three demonstrators and wounded more than 100.
The students skipped classes at several universities and secondary schools in Baghdad and across Iraq's majority-Shiite south on Monday to take part in the protests, despite the government ordering schools and universities to operate normally.
One of those killed was a 22-year-old female medical student, the first woman to be killed since the protests began this month.
In a separate development, three rockets struck a large military base north of Baghdad that houses U.S. and Iraqi forces, according to a senior Iraqi security official who said there were no casualties.
NC judges throw out congressional map for 2020
RALEIGH, N.C. - North Carolina judges on Monday blocked the state's congressional map from being used in the 2020 elections, ruling that voters had a strong likelihood of winning a lawsuit that argued Republicans unlawfully manipulated district lines for partisan gain.
The panel of three Superior Court judges issued a preliminary injunction preventing elections under the district lines, starting with the March 3 primary.
In the ruling Monday, the judges - Paul Ridgeway, Alma Hinton and Joseph Crosswhite - agreed that "there is a substantial likelihood that plaintiffs will prevail on the merits of this action by showing beyond a reasonable doubt that the 2016 congressional districts are extreme partisan gerrymanders" in violation of the state constitution.
In Silicon Valley: Hundreds of Facebook employees have signed a letter to CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other executives saying they oppose the social network's policy of letting politicians lie in advertisements.
The New York Times reported Monday that more than 250 workers have signed the letter urging Facebook leaders to change the policy that they say is a "threat to what FB stands for." While that's a small fraction of Facebook's workforce of more than 35,000, it's a rare showing of employee dissent.
Facebook spokeswoman Bertie Thomson said the company appreciates its employees voicing concerns but it "remains committed to not censoring political speech."

Trump to police: Afghanistan is safer than Chicago

Texto completo: CHICAGO — President Trump took the occasion of an address to a national conference of police chiefs here to tee off on the city's police superintendent and highlight its ongoing challenges with crime, claiming that Afghanistan "is a safe place by comparison."
Ahead of Trump's appearance Monday at the gathering of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson announced that he would not attend because he felt "it just doesn't line up with our city's core values."
Trump seized on those comments early in his remarks, telling the crowd: "There's one person who is not here today. This person should be here because maybe he could learn something."
He then identified Johnson by name and cited his remarks about "values."
"That's a very insulting statement after all I've done for the police," Trump said. "I've done more than any other president has done for the police."
"Here's a man who could not bother to show up for a meeting of police chiefs," he continued. "He's not doing his job."
Claiming that Chicago's violence is "embarrassing to us as a nation," Trump took aim at Johnson in remarkably personal terms, saying Chicago's police "are entitled to a police superintendent who has their backs and knows what he's doing."
Trump rattled off several statistics about crime in Chicago, the nation's third-largest city, which had 530 murders last year.
"Afghanistan is a safe place by comparison," Trump said.
In a news conference after Trump's remarks, Johnson said that "facts matter," highlighting the city's efforts to reduce violence and homicides in recent years.
"We've had double-digit reductions in crime for the last three years," Johnson said, adding that he disputed what he described as "the national narrative of Chicago as a city on fire."
The city's violence has drawn national attention and concern in recent years as it rose in 2016 to levels Chicago had not seen in two decades, though it has declined since that point. Since 2016 — when Chicago had more homicides than New York and Los Angeles combined — the number of homicides and shootings have both fallen.
According to statistics tracked by the Chicago Tribune, 436 people were killed in the city through Saturday, 46 fewer than a year earlier. More than 2,310 people were shot as of Sunday, according to the Tribune's database, down 223 from a year earlier.
Chicago, in particular, has been a recurring feature of Trump's remarks and Twitter feed.
During his speech Monday, Trump repeated a variation of a story he's told in the past, claiming that he spoke to "a really powerful, strong-looking" officer in the city years earlier who had told him police could fix the city's violence "in one day, sir."
Asked about this on Monday, Johnson said that the Police Department searched extensively for whoever this officer might be but "we were never able to identify him."
"We spent a lot of time trying to identify this person," Johnson said. "Because if there's somebody that can stop crime in a day, then I would bow down to them and say bring it on."
Writing on Twitter shortly after Trump spoke, Chicago's mayor, Lori E. Lightfoot, denounced his “insulting, ignorant buffoonery."
“Rather than belittle Chicago's communities with hateful and dishonest rhetoric, he needs to go back to D.C. and face his fate," Lightfoot wrote, adding that she stood by Johnson.

Trump's desire for Syrian oil fraught with legal problems
WASHINGTON — President Trump was persuaded to keep a number of troops in Syria partly so the United States could have some of its oil. But the idea of seizing petroleum in the war-torn country presents a big barrel of problems.
Trump explained Sunday that one of the reasons he decided to keep a contingent of about 200 US troops in Syria was to prevent the oil fields in the eastern portion of the country from being retaken by the Islamic State, which had once used them as a source of income. The president made the about-face after enduring withering criticism from within his own party about pulling US troops from Syria's border with Turkey.
"We're protecting the oil, we're securing the oil," Trump said during a news conference about the death of Islamic State commander Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi during a US military operation in Syria.
But Trump's rationale did not stop there. The oil, he added, "can help us because we should be able to take some, also."
There are a number of legal and strategic challenges for the United States, or any US firm, to get that oil, according to a several experts. Trump's suggestion that the oil can be taken by the United States is the latest in a long list of legally dubious proclamations the president has made while in office.
To start, the United States has no legal claim to the oil in the first place. Pillaging the natural resources of another nation is a violation of the Geneva Conventions, according to Ryan Goodman, a professor at the New York University School of Law who once served as special counsel to the general counsel of the Defense Department.
Further complicating matters is the fact that the United States claims it is not in an armed conflict with the Syrian government. "So Syrian property is not enemy property that might be taken, even for military purposes, as spoils of war," said Sarah H. Cleveland, a professor of human and constitutional rights at Columbia Law School.

Texto completo: For centuries, humans have experienced the fierce, hot and dry winds that are fanning California's recent spate of wildfires. Known as Santa Anas in the southern part of the state and Diablos in the north, they arrive regularly in the fall.
"They've been here since before we've been here," said Janin Guzman-Morales, a postdoctoral researcher at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego. "It's a natural process in this region."
But the winds' future in a changing climate is less certain. Recent research by Dr. Guzman-Morales and others suggests that as the climate warms, the winds may become less frequent, especially at the fringes of their season in fall and spring.
That is not necessarily good news. Coupled with changes in patterns of precipitation that are also expected to occur as the climate warms, it may mean that California's wildfire season will shift from fall into winter, with longer and more intense fires later in the year.
Currently, however, most of California's worst wildfires occur in the fall, when vegetation is driest and the winds start to pick up. The Santa Anas have their origin east of California, in the Great Basin, the high desert that includes much of Nevada and the western half of Utah.
Cold and dry high-pressure air develops over the basin and circulates in a clockwise motion. The air spills into California, over the Sierra Nevada, and, because it is heavier than warmer air, it slides down the slopes. As it descends it becomes compressed and warms significantly, by close to 30 degrees Fahrenheit for every mile of lost elevation. Already dry, it becomes drier still as it warms up.
Traveling downslope, the air also picks up speed. In some places this acceleration is aided by the funneling effect of the air traveling through gaps in the mountains.
All in all, what began as cold, dry, relatively slow-moving air becomes warm, bone-dry, fast-moving air, traveling at speeds approaching 100 miles an hour in extreme cases and drawing more moisture out of already-dry shrubs and trees. In the face of this onslaught, even the smallest bit of burning vegetation can quickly develop into a full-blown wildfire.

Because they start as zones of high-pressure air in the Great Basin, Santa Ana winds can be forecast. The ones that occur in the fall tend to get the most notice, because the fire risk is high. But Santa Anas are actually more active in the wetter winter months, Dr. Guzman-Morales said.
In her research, published this year, she and a colleague looked at how the winds would change over the 21st century under various climate models. Overall, they found that warming would weaken the high-pressure systems over the Great Basin and decrease the frequency of Santa Ana events.
But the decrease would not be uniform from October to April, Dr. Guzman-Morales said. "It decreases more in the shoulder season," she said. The winter months will still see significant Santa Ana activity.
That could mean a later wildfire season, she said, as independent studies have shown that precipitation patterns in California will shift with warming: rains would most likely come later in the season. So a strong Santa Ana might occur in a relatively dry December, leading to wildfires.
"The window for wildfires is expanding toward winter," Dr. Guzman-Morales said.
Californians already have a sense of what this future might be like. In 2017, winter winds came late, and December was still relatively dry. Santa Ana winds fueled the Thomas fire, a huge wildfire in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties that began on Dec. 4 and burned for more than a month.

Texto completo: Credit where credit is due. The death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, announced by President Donald Trump on Sunday, doesn’t mean the end of the Islamic State, but it will knock the organization back on its heels — at least for a while.
Few will mourn the demise of a terror leader who oversaw beheadings and genocide, and inspired attacks that killed thousands of people. The U.S. commando assault in which Baghdadi died seems to have been a textbook operation resulting from long, careful intelligence gathering and cooperation – active or passive – by several countries.
Baghdadi, like all such leaders, will be replaced and his movement will continue in some form. While his death might spur some militants to seek revenge against the United States, on balance it’s likely to make the Islamic State – which many experts said had been quietly rebuilding — less of an inspiration to lone individuals who might be tempted to launch terror attacks in Europe or North America.
Trump’s graceless, gloating performance announcing Baghdadi’s death aside, so far, so good.
But exactly what does this operation mean for U.S. policy in Syria, particularly after the stomach-churning twists and turns of recent weeks? What now?
The months-long operation against Baghdadi was a result of arrangements that were in place before Trump announced that he was pulling the small U.S. force out of Syria. Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces reportedly provided intelligence from assets across northern Syria. As early as March, the Kurds said Baghdadi was hiding in northwest Syria, on the opposite side of the country from the Islamic State’s strongholds to the east. They were right; that’s where he was tracked down.
The New York Times quoted officials as saying Trump’s decision forced the military to go ahead with the plan before they were completely ready, and that the plan succeeded “largely in spite of Mr. Trump’s actions.”
When Trump announced the U.S. withdrawal, he abandoned the Kurds who had done the bulk of the fighting against the Islamic State, leaving them to face a vastly superior Turkish invasion of northeast Syria on their own. Samantha Power, President Barack Obama’s former ambassador to the United Nations, has accused him of encouraging ethnic cleansing. He is also strengthening the hand of Iran, Syrian President Bashar Assad – and especially Vladimir Putin.
He cast his decision in terms of making good on a promise to get the U.S. out of the Middle East — except that really wasn’t true. At the same time, he was sending more troops to Saudi Arabia. It was plausible to think that it was all – or mostly – about oil, of which Saudi Arabia has much and Syria has relatively little.
Just days before the raid in which Baghdadi died, however, Trump announced that the new U.S. mission would be to secure Syria’s oil. He reiterated that on Sunday. In what world does that make sense?
The White House’s state rationale for redeploying around the oil fields has been to prevent the Islamic State from regaining control. It’s true that the Islamic State made a lot of money ($40 million a month in 2015, according to a Treasury Department estimate) pumping oil in Syria and selling it on the black market before it lost the oil fields a couple years ago.
However, things were going well enough before Trump decided to pull out – and losing its leader will make it all the more difficult for the Islamic State to make a new play for the oil fields. And if Trump truly wants to let people in the Middle East sort out their own problems, there are plenty of others who would be more than happy to ensure the oil stays out of the hands of the Islamic State.
Even if your goal is nothing more than the cynical pursuit of national self-interest – and you define self-interest in terms of oil — why would you bother protecting the petroleum assets of a country whose reserves don’t even rank in the world’s top 30? Syria’s oil production already was falling before civil war started ripping it apart in 2011, and it didn’t produce enough natural gas for its own domestic consumption.
For this mission, the U.S. military wouldn’t be using special forces, which require a minimum of logistics support. The Pentagon is reportedly developing plans to insert armored units including tanks – which it will then have to figure out how to supply in hostile territory.
These are the same oil fields where a pro-Syrian government force including Russian mercenaries attacked a small contingent of U.S. troops last February. U.S. air strikes inflicted huge losses. The oil and gas fields may not be a huge deal in the global market, but they’re vital to Assad. He’s unlikely to attack U.S. armored units directly, but he’s equally unlikely to let them sit there unchallenged. Nor are the Iranians and Russians.
Think about the scenario for this force offered up by Aaron Stein of the conservative Foreign Policy Research Institute: “You would have to protect it from the air. You have to supply it and then you have got to protect the road, presumably from Iraq. You can easily see a scenario where we end up with more troops in Syria than we started off with.”
In the Trump era, that’s apparently how you disengage.

20 years later, 'Tiger Lady' still hard to fathom

Texto completo: One of the more memorable, stranger-than-fiction sagas in New Jersey history began with a sight almost too surreal to believe: a Bengal tiger, roaming through a backyard in Jackson on a brisk January day.
That sighting on Wright Debow Road on the afternoon of Jan. 27, 1999, sparked an eight-hour search through the township that brought upward of 100 state and local officers to the scene.
Police blocked off roadways, contacted the nearby schools to make sure buses wouldn't be dropping off students and worked to prevent onlookers from getting near the scene.
Staff from the nearby Six Flags Great Adventure theme park, all of their safari's tigers accounted for, joined in the search.
Helicopters buzzed overhead and the media descended on the then still-sleepy Ocean County town. The headline in the New York Post the next morning would tell of a "TERRIFYING HUNT IN N.J. WOODS."
After finishing his workday at ecological restoration company the Dawson Corp. on Wright Debow Road around 5:15 p.m. that day, Steve McNamara was walking to his Ford Explorer in the parking lot when he realized he was within 50 feet of something extraordinary.
"A large, four-foot high, eight-foot long orange blur," his how he described it to the Asbury Park Press.
The blur moved a little closer, came into focus, and McNamara was in disbelief.
"I was startled," he said at the time. "I said, 'This can't be true. A tiger can't be sitting in my parking lot.'"
Hours into the search for the big cat — a male measuring more than 9 feet long and weighing 431 pounds — the tiger was spotted by a local woman in the parking lot of a Wright Debow Road business, and came within 20 feet of now-retired Jackson police officer Anthony Senatore.
"When there's no bars between you and a tiger," Senatore said, "yeah, he's pretty big."
Staff from Great Adventure unsuccessfully tried to shoot the tiger with a tranquilizer gun.
With nightfall rapidly approaching, the New Jersey Division of Fish, Game and Wildlife, which was in charge of the operation at the scene, made the decision to have the tiger killed.
Using their lights and sirens, police drew the tiger out of the woods. Senatore, armed with a department-issued .308 sniper rifle, and another officer fired.
"I hit him, he fell, he rolled, he got back up, and he went into the woods," Senatore said.
"So now I was dealing with a wounded tiger."
Sniper rifle in hand, Senatore, a tracker and another officer entered the woods to track the animal.
Yet this wild tale was only just beginning.
While a tiger on the loose in Ocean County is certainly notable, the ordeal shined a national spotlight on a reclusive local woman, nicknamed "The Tiger Lady," who had been harboring big cats for decades on her property.
The suspicion and controversy that swirled around Joan Byron-Marasek was covered in the pages of the New York Times, warranted a 2002 New Yorker profile by "The Orchid Thief" author Susan Orlean and even inspired a novelty song (Julie Gold's "Tiger in New Jersey.")
"COPS EYE CAT-LOVIN' 'TIGER LADY' IN JERSEY SCARE," screamed a headline in the New York Post.
Byron-Marasek, reportedly a former circus performer, had housed tigers under a theatrical animal permit at the Tigers Only Preservation Society, an 11.7-acre compound on Route 537 near Allyson Road in Jackson since the mid-1970s.
"I eat, sleep, and breathe tigers," she told the New York Times. "I never take vacations. This is my love, my passion."
For many years, the smattering of homeowners in the area had few issues with her single-minded hobby.
"I've been here 13 years and I have never had a problem with her or her tigers," neighbor Ed Schlechtweg of Berwyn Lane told the Press in the immediate aftermath of the wandering tiger incident.
But by the late '90s, big changes were happening in Jackson — and in Byron-Marasek's neighborhood.
Between 1990 and 2000, the 100-square-mile township's population rose 29 percent to 42,816 residents. Another 12,000 or so people would be living there by 2010.
Emblematic of the town's emerging suburban character was The Preserve, an ironically named subdivision of 31 single-family homes that opened next to Byron-Marasek's property in 1997.
Her new neighbors complained that the compound smelled like a "dirty animal cage." The odor of raw meat was particularly bad in the warm weather, they said.
"We do not want to put up with another summer of this because when it gets 90 degrees-plus, it gets bad," Kevin Wingler, a resident of The Preserve, told the Press in 2002.
"I don't mind her having tigers on her property," Scott Kayser, president of the Quality Express trucking company on Allyson Road, said in 1999. "But you have got to have the proper measures to prevent an escape. ... I'm pretty sure the tiger belongs to her."
Yet the "Tiger Lady" insisted it wasn't.
To this day, it's still not certain the tiger belonged to her.
On the day of the tiger search, school bus driver Barbara Clayton had to take a longer alternate route back to her nearby Wright Debow Road home because of police barricades.
When she finally arrived, she found her her 4-year-old son, Stephen, and her 5-year-old nephew, William, playing in the front yard.
Only later did she learn that the tiger was just an eighth of a mile away.
That's where Senatore, the Jackson cop, and his search party finally tracked the tiger down, near Interstate 195, about a half an hour after wounding it.
"I put another kill shot into him," Senatore said, "and that was it."
The tiger was killed less than a mile from the Tigers Only compound. Yet that wasn't conclusive proof it had come from there.
"It's absolutely not her tiger. I walked around the grounds and couldn't see how a tiger could've got out," her lawyer, Valter H. Must, told reporters days after the tiger was killed, when state game wardens conducted a search of the compound.
"There was no hair, no evidence of a cat moving through the area of containment," Must added. "(Byron-Marasek) said there's absolutely no way a cat could scale a fence of that height."
Municipal officials, however, were convinced. "It's not a hundred percent conclusive, but all indications are the tiger came from her property," then Jackson Mayor William J. Allman told reporters.
"The longest-range possibility (is) someone came from out of state and dropped it off, but that's a pretty far-fetched thing," Allman added.
Months later, in June 1999, state officials announced that DNA hair samples taken from the preserve matched hair taken from the dead tiger. Yet a deputy attorney general would say in court the following year that the state could not definitively prove the tiger was Byron-Marasek's.
Of greater concern for Byron-Marasek was the state's decision not to renew her permit to keep tigers on her property, due to poor condition of the preserve and sloppy record-keeping.
An intense, four-year legal battle ensued.
"This is my life. This is 25 years of my work. Many of these tigers were born here and raised here. To close us down would be a travesty of justice," Byron-Marasek told reporters during a press conference held on her property in 2000.
"We have been here 25 years without a single person being injured. There is not a zoo, circus, or amusement park that can boast of a similar safety record," she said. Her tigers had formed a family unit, she added, and if forced to move and be separated, "most would die from shock and fright."
However, in October 2002, Byron-Marasek's husband, Jan Marasek, suffered head and arm injuries inflicted by one of the tigers. A little more than a year later, in November 2003, after Byron-Marasek lost her final appeal, the state confiscated her 24 tigers and had them transported to the Wild Animal Orphanage in San Antonio, Texas. By August 2004, the Press had reported that at least three healthy cubs had been born to one of the tigers.
Three of the Jackson tigers had been euthanized by then. Two had developed illnesses: Misha, an approximately 5- year-old male, had a brain tumor, while an 8- or 9-year-old female had kidney failure. A third tiger, named Marko, who had injured Byron-Marasek's husband, was put down due to aggressive behavior, the Press reported.
After their arrival in Texas, the tigers were treated for ailments including foot infections, dehydration, stomach parasites and malnutrition, according to the Massachusetts-based International Fund for Animal Welfare, a major backer of the Wild Animal Orphanage.
"The tigers' health has improved greatly since their arrival to our sanctuary," said Carol Asvestas, the preserve's executive director. "They now have proper care and the space they deserve. For most of these animals, it's a happy ending."
But that wasn't the end of the story.
The Wild Animal Orphanage closed in September 2010. The San Antonio Express-News reported in 2011 that the Global Federation of Animal Sanctuaries had found sanctuaries for the facility's 55 tigers. That total included seven remaining tigers from Jackson.
Four of the tigers were relocated to the Carolina Tiger Rescue in North Carolina, while three went to the Big Cat Rescue in Florida, according to Global Federation of Animal Sanctuaries executive director Valerie Taylor.
The last of the Jackson tigers, Max, died in January in North Carolina at the age of 19, Taylor said.
Byron-Marasek lost the Route 537 property via a tax lien foreclosure in 2017, according to public records. The property is currently owned by a Lakewood-based LLC and is on the market for $950,000.
The Press was unable to reach Byron-Marasek for comment.
Senatore, who was assigned to the detective bureau at the time, retired for the force in 2010 after 19 years of service.
John Bergmann, director of the Associated Humane Societies' Popcorn Park Zoo in the Forked River section of Lacey, said there's a clear lesson he hopes people learn from the "Tiger Lady" saga.
"You want a pet, go get a domestic dog or cat," he said. "There's shelters all over the country that are facing (the decision) sometimes to euthanize to animals because (there's) not enough owners or not enough people to adopt them.
"Go get a dog or a cat and let that be your companion."

Texto completo: Tinseltown had turned its attention to the Cereal City, and Battle Creek was wrought with anticipation over how its proud history would be portrayed on the big screen. "The Road to Wellville" was based on T.C. Boyle's bestselling novel. It was set in Battle Creek at the turn of the 20th century, a fictional account of John Harvey Kellogg's peculiar methods for biologic living at his world-famous Sanitarium.
It was also, as it turned out, a movie with more than its fair share of masturbation and poop jokes.
"One should never, ever interrupt one's desire to defecate." a buck-toothed Anthony Hopkins, playing J.H. Kellogg, intoned in the opening scene.
The 1994 film carried with it the weight of acclaimed director Alan Parker, who made "Midnight Express," about an American in a Turkish prison, and "The Commitments," a Dublin soul music fairy tale set that enjoyed a brief cult status. It had an ensemble cast including Hopkins, Matthew Broderick, Bridget Fonda, John Cusack and Dana Carvey.
But Battle Creek audiences generally left disappointed, and, 25 years after its release, "The Road to Wellville" is hard to find here.
Neither Battle Creek Family Video stores or Willard Public Library carry copies of the DVD, which can be purchased online for $13.80 on eBay, $34.80 on Barnes and Noble and $40.99 on Amazon.
In a digital age with a seemingly endless supply of streaming options, the only place to find "The Road to Wellville" online are via bootleg copies uploaded to YouTube.
There are no planned screenings in Battle Creek to commemorate the movie's silver anniversary.
The city, it seems, has forgotten its moment on the silver screen.
Or at least it would like to.
Kurt Thornton, a Battle Creek Historian, attended the film's Michigan premiere on Oct. 25, 1994, at what is now JC Cinema.
"It was a disappointing movie, period," Thornton said. "It wasn't the stories of Battle Creek...I thought it would be so much better.
"It would have been a better movie if they told a better (story) of Dr. Kellogg," he said. "Sometimes, the actual stuff is more hard to believe."
The story behind the story Historical accounts of J.H. Kellogg paint him as an eccentric genius and a showman in the field of health reform.
He and his brother-turned-rival, Will Keith Kellogg, are credited with the invention of flaked cereal in the Sanitarium's experimental kitchen. He is among the inventors of peanut butter and helped pioneer meat substitutes.
As the director of the Sanitarium, J.H. Kellogg attracted the powerful and the famous, including Presidents Warren G. Harding and William Howard Taft, Amelia Earhart, Thomas Edison, Henry Ford and C.W. Post.
The spa's worldwide reputation essentially put Battle Creek on the map.
But J.H. Kellogg was a complex figure: inspired but cantankerous, charismatic but stubborn and self-righteous.
His feud with his brother, stemming from the addition of sugar to and the commercial appeal of their products, would be carried to the grave. The sibling spat has been well documented in popular culture through books such as "The Kelloggs: The Battling Brothers of Battle Creek," as well as an episode of "Drunk History" staring Luke and Owen Wilson.
J.H. Kellogg was also a leading voice in the now-discredited eugenics movement, which preached white supremacy and promoted the involuntary sterilization of "defectives" and harsh limits on immigration.
But it was his zeal for health reform that made him an attractive character study for Boyle.
T.C. Boyle and J.H. Kellogg "I don't go into a project with prejudice," Boyle said. "I was fascinated about... the American genius who has some kind of idea that is all consuming, but it also transforms our lives in ways that maybe the general who wins the battle didn't. The great egomaniacs of the 20th century. They created great things but were flawed to a degree."
Boyle spent two weeks in Battle Creek researching for the novel, combing over materials at Willard Library.
He has never claimed the book was a historical document. It's a satirical look at the cereal boom that gripped the city in the early 20th century.
"I've always been interested in deflating heroes," Boyle told the New York Times in 1993. "I read all the historical data, but I'm a novelist."
That same year, he embarked on a promotional tour that included a stop in Battle Creek, where he gave a reading from the book on the stage at McCamly Place.
While signing autographs there, he was approached by Kathleen Kellogg, granddaughter of J.H. Kellogg. She took issue with the novel's portrayal of her father, J.H.'s adoptive son George, as a drunk and ne'er-do-well.
"My father was not a drunk," Kellogg told Boyle, according to the New York Times piece. "He taught health at the YMCA."
To which Boyle replied, "Well, I mean, I'm a novelist. This is just an American story."
From page to screen On the heels of the success of "The Commitments," Parker led the effort to secure the rights to Boyle's novel, and adapted the book into a screenplay.
"I was immediately drawn to the three interwoven stories and the outrageous, eccentric world that Boyle had parachuted us into with all of his usual anarchic and irreverent wickedness," Parker wrote in an essay on the film posted to his website. "Anthony Hopkins was my first choice for Dr. Kellogg, and it was some months before he agreed."
Parker too immersed himself in research to recreate the world of J.H. Kellogg, visiting Battle Creek to collect photographs and memorabilia, of which there is no shortage given J.H. Kellogg's mastery of publicity.
As Battle Creek of the early 1990s no longer resembled the one of 1907, principal photography was done at the Mohonk Mountain House, 90 miles north of New York City. Interior shots were filmed at studios located in North Carolina.
With a $25 million budget, it took 62 shooting days to complete the film, which was distributed by Columbia Pictures.
Ahead of the movie's premiere, the Historical Society of Battle Creek opened a special J.H. Kellogg exhibit in an effort to balance the historical figure with the enema-happy quack portrayed in the book.
While there was an uneasiness about how J.H. Kellogg would be portrayed, there were also concerns that movie-goers would conflate the doctor with his cereal magnate brother, which might have had ramifications for the multi-billion dollar Kellogg Co.
The Kellogg Co. has long tried to distance founder W.K. Kellogg from his older brother. The company received media inquiries regarding the film, but mostly steered reporters to the historical society for information.
But the company did take the time to prepare talking points.
"While the book and the movie mention the Kellogg name, it is not an autobiography of Kellogg Company founder Will Keith Kellogg," said one, preserved in a file kept by the historical society. "As we understand it, 'The Road to Wellville,' the book and the movie, is a fictional, satirical account of health consciousness. It happens to be set in Battle Creek, Michigan in 1907."
Reviews are in John Sherwood had researched the central figures that led to the cereal boom in his former role as a reporter for the Battle Creek Enquirer. He was also a critic of local theater, so he was tasked with reviewing the film during its Battle Creek screening.
"The book is very intellectual, and I think a precise satire on many aspects of human life and uses Battle Creek and Kellogg as a departure point," Sherwood said.
But he also said the movie is "not a good version of the book."
"At the time, during the screening, the theater was packed and we were all pretty happy to be there. When we filed out, I remember a lot of head shaking, a lot of 'I don't know' muttering," he said. "We were baffled by the inaccuracies and baffled by the fact such a poor movie had been made."
Aside from historical inaccuracies, the movie also differed from the book on several key points. C.W. Post, who wrote the original 'The Road to Wellville' as a insert in his cereal boxes and inspired the name of Boyle's novel, is relatively absent in the movie, though there are references to the Post Tavern.
And in the novel's climax, J.H. Kellogg kills George, whereas the movie, the doctor saves his adopted son.
What most agree is that the book and film's account of the cereal boom is largely historically accurate.
By 1902, as many as 32 cereal manufacturers were recorded in Battle Creek, and only a few years later, more than 80 cereal company names were registered. A number of these were fly-by-night operations offering little more than a name on a box. That dynamic was central to the story of Charles Ossining, an invented character in the film played by Cusack.
Sherwood believes the poor reaction in Battle Creek was due in part to a "sanctimonious idea" of J.H. Kellogg.
"Because people wanted to go in and see a movie that was to them a prideful account of a great era in Battle Creek history," he said. "Instead they got assaulted with sex joke after sex joke and were embarrassed by it, and, as a result, many people were upset and angry."
Battle Creek may have felt collectively slighted due to its portrayal in a movie that included a lot of nudity and adult language. But the city in which "The Road to Wellville" was set was far from alone in its discontent.
"Wellville is the most elegantly designed movie ever made about early 20th-century bowel movements. Good health to all, but it may not be enough," wrote USA Today.
The film holds a 41% rating on the review-aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes, and it was a commercial failure, too, with a domestic gross of $6,562,513 according to boxofficemojo.com.
Late film critic Roger Ebert gave the film three-out-of-four stars, but noted "The Road to Wellville" was not for everybody, writing, "Oddly enough, it may be the very people the satire is aimed at who will enjoy it the most."
Boyle admits his bias but said he still loves the movie.
"In my mind, it should have won all the Academy Awards and been in the theaters still playing today," he said. "Nothing to compare it to. I always cringe when they say it's a comedy. Ninety percent of (comedies) are the same. This was radically different. I have to give Alan and the cast credit. It makes you a little squeamish. It's bizarre. It's my vision of the world, and not everybody appreciates that."
Though not a fan of the film, Thornton said he removed some posters from the theater walls during the 1994 screening as keepsakes and purchased the DVD a few years ago.
"It was a major picture that features Battle Creek," Thornton said. "It's part of Battle Creek's history, whether I like it or not."
Sherwood added that "The Road to Wellville" has not aged well, but the hard feelings Battle Creek residents experienced during the premiere have softened over 25 years.
"I think Battle Creek was honored to be part of a movie, then when they walked out of the theater, not so honored," he said. "They were having fun that night, a lot of gasps. What I would say, it came tantamount to shock. I think as a result, over time, that memory has faded, and replaced by a sense of, 'that was amusing.'"

Texto completo: At first, I wasn't sure I wanted to read Ronan Farrow's book.
I didn't want to spend hours with a revolving cast of powerful men accused of doing unspeakable things to women, with impunity or the next best thing. I know the world can be like this, but I didn't want to know the world can be like this.
Now I know, in painful detail, thanks to Farrow and "Catch and Kill: Lies, Spies, and a Conspiracy to Protect Predators." And you should too.
Farrow is the New Yorker magazine contributor who shared the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for public service with Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey of The New York Times. Their reporting is why disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein is headed to trial on rape charges in New York City and could spend the rest of his life in prison if convicted.
Their work fueled the #MeToo movement and gave voice to scores of women who allege Weinstein harassed, groped, raped or otherwise forced himself on them and then brutalized them into silence. Their meticulous reporting allowed these women not just to be heard but to be listened to for the first time. And it brought to account men accused of sexual miscount and the industry that protected them.
But this is where the stories diverge.
Kantor and Twohey's new book, "She Said: Breaking the Sexual Harassment Story that Helped Ignite a Movement," details what it's like to be investigative journalists for a newspaper that gave them the time, resources and support to make a difference. Told in the third person, it has the cool, authoritative voice of The New York Times. It focuses on the women who broke their silence and the work that helped them do it; it's a primer on how to do deep-dive journalism.
"Catch and Kill," which was released Tuesday, is a far different work. It's equal parts memoir, spy story and portrait of perseverance - the women's and the author's - under terrible circumstances.
Farrow began exploring rumors of Weinstein's sexual misconduct as a reporter for NBC News. In "Catch and Kill," he describes what it's like to work for a media outlet that tried to quash the story. The New Yorker later published Farrow's series of articles on which this book is based.
The NBC that Farrow portrays in "Catch and Kill" is the definition of a hostile workplace. Farrow's more sensational allegations about the company have already made their way into the headlines.
He described MSNBC President Phil Griffin waving around an enlarged image of a television personality's genitalia during a work meeting. And Farrow leveled the bombshell allegation that former "Today" show co-anchor Matt Lauer anally raped a young colleague while they were covering the Sochi Olympics in 2014.
That colleague is Brooke Nevils, and her complaint led to Lauer's firing in 2017, but NBC News did not disclose the accusation at the time. Lauer denies the allegation; he says he and Nevils had a consensual affair. Nevils' allegations are lengthy, graphic and on the record in "Catch and Kill." Her account underscores the pain, damage and, in Farrow's telling, the complexity of sexual assault. After Sochi, Nevils and Lauer had several sexual encounters, at his home and in his office.
"Nevils told friends at the time that she felt trapped," Farrow wrote. "Lauer's position of authority - over both her and her boyfriend, whose brother worked for Lauer - made her feel unable to say no."
Lauer is the specter that hangs over much of Farrow's deeply reported book, with its largely on-the-record accusations.
A foundation of "Catch and Kill" is Farrow's contention that Weinstein had collected dirt on Lauer and that NBC killed Farrow's story on the producer's misdeeds to protect the star at the center of one of the network's most important franchises. NBC counters that Farrow's work was neither substantiated nor ready to run.
As the Los Angeles Times has reported, NBC has launched a counterassault against the book at the same time it is trying to quell the uproar Farrow's allegations have caused among its employees.
At the heart of "Catch and Kill" is Farrow's quest to get the story - and then get it published. All the while, Farrow alleges, NBC worked to shut down his efforts.
Throughout "Catch and Kill," the author maintains that Weinstein tried to bully them into silence, and to threaten, harass and buy off the women Weinstein had harmed. Farrow writes that Weinstein went so far as to have him followed by spies with ties to Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency.
Actress Daryl Hannah, whose sexual harassment allegations against Weinstein are detailed in the book, said she previously had told anyone who would listen, but it didn't matter.
"I think it doesn't matter if you're a well-known actress," she told Farrow. "It doesn't matter if you're twenty or if you're forty. It doesn't matter if you report or if you don't because we are not believed.
"We are more than not believed - we are berated and criticized and blamed."
Someday, maybe, that will no longer be the case.

JIM ROONEY'S BOOK ON HIS FATHER, DAN, EXPANDS A LEGACY

Texto completo: You wouldn't suspect there'd be a lot of people walking around thinking, "I wish there were more books about the Rooneys, especially Dan," but that's never really discouraged anyone.
There's Art Rooney Jr.'s book about his brother Dan and Art Rooney Sr. and just about everyone the author or his primary subjects ever came into contact with; there's Dan's book about himself; there's Dan's book about North Side history and architecture, there's Pitt historian Rob Ruck's book about Art Sr., and I'm sure there are more.
None of that is to suggest it can't be a useful undertaking, such being the scope of the Rooney legend, and Jim Rooney's "A Different Way To Win, Dan Rooney's Story from the Super Bowl to the Rooney Rule," is in fact highly useful on a number of levels, perhaps most particular as it focuses on head coach Mike Tomlin, even if this new book has its emotional grounding amid the inescapable demands of grief.
In representing a second generation of Rooney to author a book primarily about his father, Jim Rooney was only getting started as Dan's life ended 2 1/2 years ago. Further, Jim dedicates the book to three deceased sisters, Kathleen, Rita and Joan, so even though "A Different Way To Win," presents as a book about business (the original intent was to pitch it to the Harvard Business Review), it is informed and sustained by loss.
"It was some of the best grieving experience anyone could ever have," Jim was saying the other day in the near North Hills. "Patricia Hume, whose husband John Hume won the Nobel Peace Prize (for his work on Ireland's troubles), her and I were in tears together for two hours. I had wonderful conversations with Loretta Brennan Glucksman (herself a part of the Irish peace process), with Joe Greene, Donnie Shell, Mel Blount, with (Former NFL) Commissioner (Paul) Tagliabue I probably sat with him over six days. I went down to see him in D.C., sitting in his office; he's not an emotional guy; it wasn't teary, but I remember him looking out into the D.C. skyscape and just remembering my dad in a way that was so much more than just a technical, professional relationship."
I thought Jim was describing a kind of speed grieving, almost, one that ultimately expanded the scope of the project.
"I didn't plan that," Jim said. "I was just trying to get the story, but the experience with these folks, and I talked to over 50 people, was that while they all had some kind of professional connection with him, they were moved in a way that to me appeared to be similar to a family member passing. That was the relationships he created."
No one should attempt to minimize Ambassador Rooney's legacy when it comes to Ireland or to the NFL or to the singular relationship between the Steelers and Pittsburgh, or to many other things, but the most topical and perhaps enduring on this side of the Atlantic remains the Rooney Rule, which mandates that any NFL team with a head coaching vacancy interview at least one minority candidate.
I hear from too many people who believe, for a variety of reasons, the Steelers should have such a vacancy today, and that the Rooney Rule painted the team into a corner from which they hired Mr. Tomlin in the first place. I hear from fewer, and still way too many, who refer to Mr. Tomlin as Coach Rooney Rule.
Some of this is benign ignorance, but another part is not so benign.
The truth is, Dan Rooney's commitment to equal opportunity predates not only Mike Tomlin's tenure here, it predates Mike Tomlin's life. As related by Jim in this book, it goes all the way back to Selma, 1965.
"Father Mark Glasgow was ordained a Roman Catholic priest in 1962 and was assigned to my parents' parish church," Jim wrote for the book. "Father Glasgow was part of a generation of young priests eager to apply the lessons they learned in the seminary to the problems and injustices of modern life. His homilies were filled with references to the struggle for civil rights. 'Father Glasgow's preaching it hit (Dan) right between the eyes,' my mother recalled.
"Dan, now in his early 30s, was already involved in the Urban League and the NAACP chapters in Pittsburgh. But Father Glasgow's homilies and private conversations persuaded him that he could be doing more. In 1965, after civil rights workers and advocates were beaten and, in several cases, murdered, he and a couple of other priests went to Selma. Father Glasgow invited Dan to join. In a decision that my father would regularly refer to as the biggest mistake of his life, he did not go."
Dan's interest in social justice, sparked by his father, would soon manifest in his role as one of the NFL's leading executives and thinkers, but the rule that now bears the family name was the end piece of a vast, league-wide structural effort that included too many critical agents to name, but included Mr. Tagliabue, the late Bill Nunn, Tony Dungy, Philadelphia Eagles owner Jeff Lurie, Denver Broncos owner Pat Bowlen, Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank, the then-St. Louis Rams' Stan Kroenke, lawyers Tom Williamson, former player and longtime NFL exec John Wooten, and many others.
When the rule finally passed in 2003, Cincinnati Bengals owner Mike Brown, whom Jim describes as the last holdout and perhaps least persuadable on the initiative's merits, became the first owner to have a minority coach in the Rooney Rule era - Western Pennsylvania native Marvin Lewis.
Mr. Tomlin's emergence along the meticulously curated network of worthy candidates began long before Bill Cowher and the Steelers separated after the 2006 season.
When the job came open, the Steelers started with a list of 37 candidates they narrowed to 12 and then to four. Before Mr. Tomlin was even interviewed, the team had already adhered to the letter of the Rooney Rule by interviewing Ron Rivera, then the defensive coordinator of the Chicago Bears and, since 2011, the head coach of the Carolina Panthers.
But Mr. Tomlin, according to book contributor Judy Battista, the former New York Times NFL essayist who is now with NFL.com, "blew Dan's doors off. He was the embodiment of everything Dan believed in this area. He was not a token hire, not a token interview."
Not surprisingly, some of the most emotional testimony in Jim's book comes from Mr. Tomlin, now in his 13th year in Pittsburgh, where he's never had a losing season and has been to two Super Bowls.
"I knew what my hiring meant to him," Mr. Tomlin says. "I knew what it short-term meant, long-term meant, what my hiring meant, and I didn't want to let him down. I know that he didn't view it in that way, but boy I did. It went beyond doing the job for me, and always will, because I understand it. I've always understood it and knew that how we performed was critical to the shaping of the legacy of his in some way. That legacy was so devoted. It's really always been a guiding force for me, in terms of having the desire to perform.
"I know he didn't want me to feel that way, but I felt that way nonetheless. How could you not?"

Texto completo: To call Billy Etzel's pizza crust thin is to be a master of understatement.
Executive chef and co-owner of Coals in Portland, Etzel borrowed inspiration for his flat, grilled pizzas from pies he tasted at Al Forno, the Providence, Rhode Island, restaurant that ignited the grilled pizza trend nearly 40 years ago. Rather than mimic those pizzas directly, he took the concept further - using a slow-rising dough of all-purpose flour laced with cornmeal and whole wheat flour to produce an impossible stretchiness.
What slides off his grill's 700-degree grates are pies with the towering verticality of a Canasta hand, or if the kitchen gets a little lazy, two stacked quarters.
On each crust, Etzel spreads a protective layer of snowy, shredded fresh mozzarella to prevent anything wet from touching the dough directly. "But you even have to find the driest cheese possible," Etzel said. "And you have to work super quick when the dough is making contact with the surface of the grill. Moisture is out."
What's in are toppings that are unlikely to leach liquid - fresh mushrooms, greens like arugula, and fully cooked, cured meats (since the pizzas spend an average of two minutes on the heat).
Oil-based pestos also fit the bill, especially stiff ones like the orange-juice-spiked pistachio pesto that forms the flavor foundation for the Bayside ($17). Onto dollops of the dense sauce, Etzel crumbles tangy goat cheese, then handfuls of casually strewn arugula and the signature squirt of olive oil that finishes most of Coals' pies. It's all a bit too savory, missing acid or peppery heat; a little more orange juice might do the trick.
The Asiago special pizza ($17) strikes a better balance with slices of warm-spiced mortadella, chiffonaded basil leaves and heavy cream steeped with crushed pistachios to balance out wallops of salty cheese.
If neither pizza sounds like anything you've seen before, that's because Etzel uses Coals Portland as a New England-based laboratory for experimentation. "We have some of the same ingredients in New York," Etzel said. "But sometimes I get bored with them, so I play around with new ideas in Portland first." Dishes he deems successful here may wind up on the menus of the two Coals Pizzas in Westchester County, New York, alongside pies like the straightforward, crackery Margherita ($14).
Etzel's culinary trial balloons aren't all pizzas, either. Take the salad appetizer ($8), for example. Here, he adds crunchy cashews, grape tomatoes, shavings of red onion and grilled pineapple to arugula tossed with a smoky chipotle vinaigrette. The pleasing interplay of peppery greens, sweet fruit and spicy heat recalls Mexico and Thailand in equal measure.
For their sake, I hope diners in Bronxville and Port Chester get an opportunity to taste one of Coals' local inventions, the Bee Cool pizza ($17) - by a long shot, the best pie I ate across two recent visits. On a lacy, bubbling layer of Grana Padano, pecorino and mozzarella, convex discs of Claremont, New Hampshire's North Country Smokehouse pepperoni glisten as their oil mingles with drizzles of hot, New York state honey. Every bite blooms with woodsmoke and basil, natural sugar and blistery char.
In bridging New England and the Empire State, the Bee Cool pie also mirrors Etzel's own story. Raised in New York by an adoptive family with a lakefront camp in Sanford, Etzel discovered in 2015 that his biological family lived in Kittery. "I used to go to Badger's Island as a teenager. The entire time, I had no idea my real sister was living just a stone's throw from there," he said.
When he and co-owner/general manager Ozzy Morales first saw the former Foundation House event venue that now houses Coals, they knew immediately that it was time to expand their business to Portland, a city Etzel used to visit each summer. "It looked great inside; there was a parking lot and a huge kitchen, which I haven't had in a very long time," he said of the space. "And it was barely used for years, so we didn't have to do much to it other than replace kitchen equipment, paint and put up our own art."
Not futzing with the building's rough-edged charm was a smart move; the dining room feels comfortably worn, as if Coals has been here, dishing up impressively juicy, white-cheddar-topped burgers ($12) for four decades, not four short months.
"This reminds me of a workshop shed," one of my dinner guests remarked, looking up at the exposed rafters, then back down at the menu. "I feel like it's the kind of place where you order wings," he announced.
So we did - a split order of 10 wings ($12), half dunked in an unreasonably sweet rosemary-maple glaze, the other half doused in a fantastic blend of Cholula hot sauce and a generous handful of finely chopped cilantro.
Toward the end of the meal, I added a little goading of my own to my already-stuffed tablemates: "I feel like this is the kind of place where you also order dessert."
Our server, who groused about the space's draftiness when she saw us slip our coats back on, recommended the Nutella pizza ($8), warning us that it would get all over our fingers, but it was worth the mess. Molten cocoa-and-hazelnut spread improves just about anything, but that wasn't the best part of the dessert. Instead, it was the powdered-sugar-dusted crust - crisp, delicate and above all: outlandishly thin.

Texto completo: The beautiful and experiential installations of Teresita Fernández allude to landscapes -- historical, geological, internal, all in a heady mix. Her "Island Universe," for example, a stunning wall-sized mosaic composed of smokey chunks of charcoal at the Ford Foundation in New York, renders the seven continents as a horizontal daisy-chain of land masses. It suggests the ancient footpath of humankind, a time long before nations and borders.
"The history of land formation is also the history of migration," said Ms. Fernández, 51, at her studio in Brooklyn, where the Miami-born, MacArthur award-winning artist has been based since 1998. Her work and career are now being celebrated in her first comprehensive survey exhibition at the Pérez Art Museum Miami.
"Island Universe" was inspired by R. Buckminster Fuller's "Dymaxion Map" that peeled the globe like an orange, she explained, and sought to undo our cultural biases based on north and south. "All this up/down, privilege/third world, modernity/primitivism is based on these cardinal directions," said Ms. Fernández, who stripped such assumptions from her representation of the world. She is interested in how viewers inevitably try to locate where they're from within this disorienting landscape.
The Miami exhibition, titled "Elemental," brings together more than 20 years of the artist's large-scale sculptures, installations, drawings and wall reliefs and seeks to challenge viewers' perceptions, both optically and culturally. Shimmering works suggest gardens, pools, waterfalls, clouds and fire, and are often composed of clusters of mirrored glass cubes or metallic steel shapes or glazed ceramic tiles that flicker and reflect people moving through, around or under them.
"People are very seduced by their own image and the exercise of looking for themselves," said Ms. Fernández, who uses that as a strategy to hold viewers' attention as they may contemplate what kind of landscape they're experiencing.
In recent years, she has frequently incorporated radiant gold on panels evoking nighttime horizons -- a direct reference, she said, to the extraction of gold by Spanish conquistadors who ravaged the land of indigenous people in the Americas.
"Teresita's beginning to zero in on facets that relate very specifically to landscape in terms of colonial history," said Franklin Sirmans, director of the Pérez, which organized the exhibition with the Phoenix Art Museum, where it will travel before going to the New Orleans Museum of Art. "That's part of the evolution of Teresita Fernández as an artist. Those things were always there, but they were hidden and shrouded in some ways."
The artist has never wanted to limit the interpretation of her deeply researched and layered work. But in recent years she has been more forthcoming about its personal and political content, including prompts in the titles such as "Charred Landscape (America)" (2017).
"Neutrality is no longer an option," she said in a lecture shortly after the 2016 presidential election.
In New Orleans, she recently completed a 60-foot mosaic of glazed ceramic tiles for the museum's sculpture garden titled "Viñales (Mayombe Mississippi)," part of a series begun in 2015 after her first visit to Cuba, her parents' homeland. The lush, swirling greens and browns of the piece reference the rural valley of Viñales, with its system of caves where indigenous people had lived, and where runaway slaves from surrounding plantations once took refuge.
But Ms. Fernández's abstract-looking image was in fact based on a CT scan of a green malachite rock from Mayombe in Congo, a site of Africans' forced migration and a landscape that reminded her of Viñales.
"The landscape inside the rock was exactly like the big landscape outside," said Ms. Fernández, who likes to conflate different scales. She noted that Congo Square in New Orleans was once the heart of the slave market and where people would celebrate Mardi Gras.
"Here's this place that's Africa, Cuba and New Orleans," she said of the piece she calls a "stacked landscape." "You can actually see your own reflection in the surface and it's like multiple times and places happening simultaneously."
For the artist, it is meaningful that her exhibition is going to "three relevant cities that have majority Latinx populations," she said, particularly to Miami, which was formative to her visual sense of the world. Her parents immigrated there from Havana as teenagers.
"They arrived to a Jim Crow South," said Ms. Fernández, noting that the city was a very different place then from what the art world now associates with Art Basel Miami. Her parents were told to go back to where they came from; she remembers being told to speak English.
"A lot of what we're watching on the news, it's not new," she said.
Early in her career, she resisted discussion of personal narrative, wary her work would be reduced to ethnic clichés. The artist Nari Ward, who is also bicultural and has known Ms. Fernández since 1996, understands the fear of being pigeonholed by identity.
"As you're coming up through the ranks, you're trying to fight for what your vision is," said Mr. Ward (he and Ms. Fernández are both represented by the Lehmann Maupin gallery). "As an older artist with a reservoir of confidence and resources, Teresita's thinking about what is the legacy she wants to claim."
Becoming an activist outside the studio was not an obvious fit for Ms. Fernández. But frustrated by what she termed the "invisibility" of Latinx artists and curators at a high level in the art world, she spent a year organizing the U.S. Latinx Arts Futures Symposium in 2016. The event, hosted and funded by the Ford Foundation, brought together 200 artists, museum directors, scholars, curators and funders to talk about the lack of Latinx representation. (While Latinx people are fastest growing ethnic group in the United States, they hold only 3 percent of museum leadership.)
Scott Rothkopf, chief curator of the Whitney Museum of American Art, told The New York Times in 2018 that the symposium was influential in his hiring of Marcela Guerrero as the museum's first curator specializing in Latinx art.
"Teresita is revealing the complexity of the Latinx conversation and taking a public leadership role in holding the mirror up to the art world," said Darren Walker, president of the Ford Foundation, which convened a second iteration of the symposium last month.
"I think there's a ripeness for something that I've been working on for a long time and that I've been living for a long time," said Ms. Fernández, who employs five women of color and Latinas in her studio.
"If the show and my own narrative expands people's understanding about being an artist from Miami, then I think it's an amazing thing," she added. "There's a lot of young artists in Miami who do not see versions of themselves in the art world."

Texto completo: We’re off and running in the capital of professional basketball.
It’s not just local fans who think that way with the Lakers back … they hope … and the Clippers at unprecedented heights of expectation.
All NBA metrics point this way. So many media outlets have moved correspondents here, the Wall Street Journal’s Jason Gay called Los Angeles “the Hemingway’s Paris of NBA dorks.”
Meanwhile, StubHub listed the leaue’s most in-demand teams, which started with:
1. Lakers.
2. Clippers.
As it turned out when No. 1 played No. 2, it was no contest. The opener was a Clippers home game – and one of the most eagerly awaited in franchise history – but so many Lakers fans bought up the place, TNT’s Reggie Miller guessed they made up two-thirds of the crowd.
When the Clippers brought Kawhi Leonard out before tipoff to welcome the crowd, there were audible jeers.
Leonard already knew the deal here. When he was shown on the Jumbotron at a recent Rams game, he was booed a lot more loudly there.
Not that hurt feelings proved a problem. Kawhi outscored the supposed prince of the city, LeBron James, 30-18, as the Clippers eased to a 112-102 victory.
James sniffed afterward, “It’s not a rivalry,” which is correct. The teams are playing for an NBA title, not local bragging rights, which are soon forgotten, even if it wasn’t the most gracious thing Bron could have said under the circumstances.
Of course, it’s a good thing for the Lakers it’s not a rivalry because they’d be losing it, having gone 5-24 against their crosstown, uh, neighbors since the start of the 2012-13 season – so long ago that Kobe Bryant and Dwight Howard were here.
Last week’s handful of games is, of course, only that, offering no proofs.
Nevertheless, however mixed the portents, they sum up the local teams’ relative positions.
The Lakers have reason to hope again with Anthony Davis’ arrival confirming their status as a destination for stars.
They retain their place as local darlings after decades of excellence, above not only the ugly duckling Clippers but the market’s old-time faves, the Dodgers and Rams.
The Clippers have most of the advantages that have been earned lately, starting with a managerial mismatch.
From an afterthought run by Coach Doc Rivers doing double duty, the Clippers have built the NBA’s hottest front office with GM Lawrence Frank and consultant Jerry West, with a deep staff of highly regarded young officials like Michael Winger and Trent Redden who turned down offers from other teams.
Meanwhile, the Lakers have to show they’re past last spring’s meltdown when Magic Johnson fled and Jeanie Buss and her friends and family took over.
Lakers fans still wince at the thought of West yearning to return in 2017, being left out in the cold and going, instead, to the Clippers.
Suggesting that unrest continued to bubble last summer, Jerry’s son, Ryan, another highly regarded young Lakers staffer, joined the Clippers.
Oh, and Ty Lue, the Lakers’ top coaching candidate before turning them down, is now an assistant on Doc Rivers’ staff.
The Clippers are deeper than the Lakers … and perhaps everyone else … with everyone solid in their roles from Patrick Beverley, Landry Shamet and Ivica Zubac to Lou Williams and Montrezl Harrell.
Leonard slides seamlessly into his role as the starters’ missing No. 1 option, able to create shots out of nothing.
The injured Paul George, another two-way star, will add his own dimension upon his return with voluminous three-point shooting – he was No. 3 in makes last season, behind James Harden and Steph Curry – that will keep the floor spread wide open.
At the end of halves and fourth quarters, Kawhi and PG will meld with the crack second unit led by Sweet Lou and Trez.
Old dynamics are changing in the West. Five-time defending conference champion Golden State had dominated the Clippers, but that’s over as the Clips showed, routing the Warriors 141-122 in the opening of sparkling, stunned Chase Arena.
“This is not a one-off,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. “This is the reality.”
The Lakers, meanwhile, will need time with a new coaching staff and nine new players, experimenting with James at point guard while awaiting the return of key pieces Kyle Kuzma and Rajon Rondo.
This means showing the necessary poise, although they couldn’t have set the bar much lower.
It was a year ago at this time that they started 1-4 and Johnson called coach Luke Walton in for a loud reproach that the press reported, decibel by decibel, turning Luke into a lame duck.
We still don’t know the whole story, but LeBron’s agent, Rich Paul, was already criticizing Walton privately but widely, including to Commissioner Adam Silver, who acknowledged it (“I think he said something along the lines that ‘Luke Walton is not the right guy to coach LeBron.’”)
This almost certainly came from James and was conveyed to Johnson, which is presumably what tripped out Magic into airing out Luke, and there went their season.
In other words, Frank Vogel had better not take his time to get this working, or do stuff Bron doesn’t like.
Everywhere but here, the rise of the underdog Clippers is as big a story as the saga of the once-majestic Lakers – or bigger.
Eight New York Times writers, asked to make predictions, all picked the Clippers to come out of the West.
Four of the eight picked the Clippers to win the title, with three picking the 76ers.
Five picked Frank to be executive of the year.
Five picked Williams as sixth man of the year and one picked Harrell.
With all the local star power, the New York Times, Washington Post, USA Today, The Athletic, Fox and NBA.com have moved correspondents here. ESPN has an entire bureau on the beat.
“These days, almost every shoe meeting happens in L.A.,” The Ringer’s Bryan Curtis wrote. “Nearly every free-agent courtship is conducted in L.A., whether the team is based here or not. In June, the Timberwolves’ unsuccessful wooing of D’Angelo Russell included a helicopter flight over the city.”
For sure, this is where it’s happening.
Now, to see what “it” is.

State Department waging war on Trump

Texto completo: House Democrats are grilling a stream of disgruntled career diplomats in a basement hearing room of the Capitol. The hearings are supposed to be secret, but -- no surprise -- Democrats leak snippets of the testimony daily. They're hoping it will add up to a case for impeaching President Donald Trump.
So far, all the testimony actually proves is that these State Department diplomats think they -- not President Trump -- ought to be running the nation's foreign policy.
Never mind executive privilege or impeachment. The most pressing constitutional issue at hand is who decides the nation's foreign policy: the president or the permanent bureaucracy.
House Democrats are accusing Trump of offering Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy a quid pro quo: dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden in exchange for nearly $400 million in aid. Trump's July 25 phone call with Zelenskiy is the subject of the hearings, but these witnesses have no firsthand knowledge of the call.
Instead, they're whimpering about being sidelined by the Trump administration and objecting that top ambassadorial appointments are going to Trump's friends instead of to them. They're seething with disdain for the president.
For example, a deputy assistant secretary named George Kent, who testified on Oct. 15, complained he was cut out of important decisions. Boohoo. Rep. Gerald Connolly, D-Va., leaked Kent's testimony, saying "here is a senior State Department official responsible for six countries" being ignored, while he watches Trump's appointees "undermining 28 years of U.S. policy."
William Taylor, acting Ukrainian ambassador who testified Tuesday, seethed with indignation that Trump went "outside regular State Department channels."
Trump's chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, described what's happening: "A group of mostly career bureaucrats" refuse to accept that "elections have consequences. And foreign policy is going to change from the Obama administration to the Trump administration."
The State Department insurrection spans embassies across the globe.
On Aug. 8, Chuck Park, a 10-year foreign service officer stationed in Mexico, penned a vitriolic public resignation for The Washington Post, condemning Trump for carrying out "mass deportations," failing "dreamers" and pursuing a "toxic agenda around the world." He publicly accused the president of "naked cruelty."
Two weeks later, Bethany Milton, a pro-immigration advocate and State Department official stationed in Rwanda, announced her resignation in The New York Times, scathingly labeling Trump's foreign policy "small-minded chauvinism."
Good riddance to Milton and Park. Resigning is what diplomats should do when they are fundamentally at odds with the administration's foreign policy approach. Taxpayers should not have to foot the bill for bureaucrats intent on sabotaging the president. No one elected them.
Predictably, the foreign policy establishment disagrees. William J. Burns, who capped his career as deputy secretary of state for President Barack Obama, argues that State Department careerists should be in charge, not the president and his appointees.
But these career diplomats favor globalism, open borders and huge American handouts to multinational organizations and third-world nations. The public elected Trump to implement the opposite -- an America First agenda. Trump must wrest control to achieve that.
Fifty years ago, Henry Kissinger understood that the diplomatic bureaucracy was biased against President Richard Nixon's foreign policy goals. As national security adviser, Kissinger pulled control of diplomacy into the White House, inciting resentment and pushback from the State Department.
Again, in 2003, Newt Gingrich warned that State Department bureaucrats were engaging in "a deliberate and systematic effort" to undermine President George W. Bush.
It's happening again. The bureaucrats are slithering up to Capitol Hill to complain about President Trump. History reminds us what's actually going on here.
On Monday evening, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a "fact sheet" about Trump's alleged impeachable offense. It provides no damning evidence, just speculation.
On Tuesday, Taylor told the hearing that another diplomat, Gordon Sondland, had informed him there was a price for military aid. But Sondland denies that, insisting the president made it clear there was no quid pro quo.
Too bad for the impeachment-hungry Dems and their sympathetic allies from the State Department.
Disagreeing with the foreign-policy elites is not an impeachable offense. In fact, millions of Americans are cheering Trump on.

Texto completo: Facebook Inc. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said the social-media giant's decision to pay media outlets who participate in its news service will give a much-needed boost to the publishing industry and provides a model other internet companies should follow.
Multiple major news publishers from the Washington Post to Fox News to The Wall Street Journal have signed on to the service, which launched Friday with a limited test audience of 200,000 users in the U.S. and will be rolled out more broadly early next year.
Mr. Zuckerberg said Facebook's service could have a positive impact on big and small publishers alike, but can't solve the media industry's deep woes on its own.
"I think every internet platform has a responsibility to help fund and support news," he said at an event in New York where he discussed the service with Robert Thomson, chief executive of News Corp, which owns the Journal. "Hopefully others will follow the model we are helping to set up."
BuzzFeed editor in chief Ben Smith said Facebook's licensing strategy "is part of a really positive trend that will put a lot of pressure on Google and others to pay publishers."
In a statement, a spokeswoman for Alphabet Inc.'s Google said the company already plays a key role in helping news outlets monetize online content through the traffic its search engine sends to their sites and revenue generated through Google's ad platforms, which most publishers rely on.
"Every month we send more than 24 billion clicks to publishers' websites," the statement said. "Publishers around the world can use Google tools for monetizing their content, and when they do, they receive over 70% of the ad revenue."
Facebook has said it plans to include news from as many as 200 publications, although many won't receive licensing fees, the Journal has reported. Among those that are paid, the fees may vary considerably. In its discussions ahead of the launch, Facebook had offered hundreds of thousands of dollars a year for smaller publishers, a few million for bigger ones, and substantially more for the very largest outlets, according to people familiar with those talks.
The move to pay for news comes as the big tech platforms have come under growing regulatory scrutiny. Google has resisted paying publishers but recently announced changes to how it ranks stories on its news page to better promote original content, addressing another long-running complaint from publishers.
The new service marked a key shift, said Mr. Thomson, who has been sharply critical of Facebook and Google for issues including their opaque algorithms, digital advertising dominance and for not paying for news on their platforms.
"Great journalism will only be sustainable at scale if there is a fundamental change in the landscape like this," he said. Mr. Thomson said Facebook's move was "a powerful precedent that will echo around editorial departments."
News Corp's deal with Facebook -- which covers the New York Post and Dow Jones publications such as The Wall Street Journal, MarketWatch and Barron's -- will generate fees reaching into the double-digit millions of dollars annually, people familiar with the agreement said. A News Corp spokesman declined to comment.
Other outlets that agreed to participate include USA Today-owner, Gannett Co., the Los Angeles Times, the New York Times, Conde Nast, NBC News, ABC News, Bloomberg Media, BuzzFeed News and Business Insider. Facebook hasn't disclosed financial terms of its arrangements with publishers.
Facebook, which has been accused of bias by conservatives in the past, sought to include a diversity of viewpoints among the outlets that will be featured, although it said they must meet certain standards of trustworthiness. While the conspiracy-theory website Infowars won't be included, headlines from far-right website Breitbart might appear.
When users click on a link within Facebook News, they will be sent to the publisher's site.

Texto completo: Her performance in an opera about greed in the Old West won her a loyal following. She also sang for celebrities' suppers at a nightclub in Manhattan.
Leyna Gabriele, a lyric coloratura soprano who became a fan-club idol for playing the title role in the first production of the tragic rags-to-riches-to-rags opera "The Ballad of Baby Doe," died on Oct. 14 in Tarrytown, N.Y. She was 95.
Her death was confirmed by her niece Michelena Hallie, one of several nieces and nephews who survive her.
Miss Gabriele (pronounced gab-ree-EL-ee) was believed to be the first singer to whom Douglas Moore gave the "Baby Doe" lyrics to audition as he was composing it at Columbia University. It was his signature opera.
Dolores Wilson played the title role in the work's world premiere, in Central City, Colo., in 1956. Miss Gabriele starred as Baby Doe on the second night and in many subsequent performances that season.
"The Ballad of Baby Doe" not only became an American repertory standard (the role was performed by, among others, the soprano Beverly Sills). It also inspired an organization of groupies, who call themselves DoeHeads, and who created a more-than-you-wanted-to-know website, including a recording of Miss Gabriele singing "Gold Is a Fine Thing."
Among the other popular arias from the opera are "Letter Aria," "Willow Song," "I Knew it Was Wrong" and "Always Through the Changing."
The opera's libretto, by John Latouche, was based on the storied real-life romance between the silver magnate Horace Tabor and Elizabeth McCourt, known as Baby Doe, the estranged wife of a failed miner. Tabor lost his fortune and died in 1899; Baby Doe became a penniless recluse whose frozen body was found in 1935 near Tabor's once-booming Matchless Mine.
Miss Gabriele was also well known in New York as the co-owner, with her husband, Vito Pisa, of Chez Vito, a Manhattan supper club where roaming Hungarian violinists and singers, the proprietress included, serenaded diners seated on plush red velvet banquettes at candlelit tables. Patrons included Roy Cohn, Wernher von Braun, and the Duke and Duchess of Windsor.
Lena Madelyn Gabriele was born on March 25, 1924, in Fairmont, W.Va., a coal-mining city near Morgantown, to Costanzo Gabriele, a shoemaker from Italy, and Michelena (Potesta) Gabriele, a homemaker.
Singing was her passion, a pursuit encouraged by her parents and her teachers. After graduating from Fairmont State College (now University) with a bachelor's degree in education in 1944, she studied voice, first in New York City and later in Italy on a Fulbright scholarship.
When she returned to New York in the early 1950s, she changed the spelling of her first name to Leyna, to make it clearer that it was pronounced LAY-nuh, with an Italian inflection.
In 1952 she was working as an office temp and living with a girlfriend from West Virginia who was dating a Hungarian violinist who played at Chez Vito. He told Miss Gabriele that the supper club was looking to hire a singer.
She auditioned by singing "La Vie en Rose" and was hired at $ 40 a week. She took Mr. Pisa's advice and learned "Core 'ngrato" ("Ungrateful Heart"), his favorite song, which became her signature. They married in 1954. (She sometimes went by the name Mrs. Pisa.) He died in 1966.
The cafe, which was originally on West 58th Street and then moved to East 60th Street, was frequented by Metropolitan Opera stars and other celebrities from the theater world, politics and other fields whose idle gossip or whispered negotiations might suddenly be curtailed by restaurant troubadours.
After Miss Gabriele closed the cafe in 1973, she taught opera workshops at Princeton University and, with the actor and director Walt Witcover, at the Masterworks Laboratory Theater at the State University of New York at Purchase.
Even while she was hosting and performing at the cafe, she continued to sing onstage. She appeared in the premieres of Jack Beeson's opera "Hello, Out There" at Columbia University in 1954 and of Sergius Kagen's "Hamlet" in Baltimore in 1963.
Reviewing her New York professional debut at Town Hall in 1958 for The New York Times, Eric Salzman praised her "musical sensitivity" and her "knack of sending forth beautifully controlled soft tones."

Texto completo: BY MICHAEL BALSAMO
The Associated Press
WASHINGTON - The Justice Department has shifted its review of the Russia probe to a criminal investigation, a person familiar with the matter said Thursday.
The person who confirmed the criminal investigation was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.
It is not clear what potential crimes are being investigated, but the designation as a formal criminal investigation gives prosecutors the ability to issue subpoenas, potentially empanel a grand jury and compel witnesses to give testimony and bring federal criminal charges.
The Justice Department had previously considered it to be an administrative review, and Attorney General William Barr appointed John Durham, the U.S. attorney in Connecticut, to lead the inquiry into the origins of special counsel Robert Mueller's probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. It's not clear when Durham's inquiry shifted to a criminal investigation.
Durham is examining what led the U.S. to open a counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign and the roles that various countries played in the U.S. probe. He is also investigating whether the surveillance methods and intelligence gathering methods used during the investigation were legal and appropriate.
Mueller's investigation shadowed Trump's presidency for nearly two years and outraged the president, who cast it as a politically motivated "witch hunt." Mueller determined that the Russian government interfered in the 2016 election, but his investigation didn't establish a criminal conspiracy between Trump's campaign and Russia. Mueller also examined 10 possible instances of obstruction of justice and has pointedly said he could not exonerate the president.
The New York Times first reported that Durham's inquiry had become a criminal investigation.
The Justice Department has said Trump recently made several calls at Barr's request to foreign leaders, including Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, to help the attorney general with the Durham investigation.
Barr also traveled with Durham to Italy in August and September, and the two met with Italian intelligence officials to seek information about the activities of FBI agents assigned there, Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte said Wednesday.
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday.

Texto completo: "Contrary to what you may have heard from others,
my brother and I have been very sensitive to this issue (of the late astronaut's possessions) since my father's passing."
Mark Armstrong
A fresh chance to pick up a piece of Neil Armstrong memorabilia rolls up Friday when a Dallas auction house opens bidding on the fourth parcel of rare goods the space hero's sons have put up for sale.
The auctions, which have raised roughly $12 million so far, concerned some people close to the late astronaut – by nature a private person who stopped signing autographs when he learned people sold them.
In July, the astronaut's personal lawyer, Ross Wales, told the New York Times the auctions ran counter to that spirit: Armstrong "just didn't like to be made a fuss over."
But one of Armstrong's two sons, Mark, outlined in an email to The Enquirer the dozens of donations and contributions he and his brother have made of their father's possessions.
"Contrary to what you may have heard from others, my brother and I have been very sensitive to this issue since my father's passing," he wrote.
The Wapakoneta native was the first man on the moon. The auctions of his belongings have coincided with the yearlong celebrations of the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing July 20, 1969.
Since October 2018, Heritage Auctions of Dallas has conducted three auctions of possessions that Rick and Mark Armstrong inherited from their parents, including hundreds of items from their father's astronaut career.
Rick Armstrong of Mason, the astronaut's elder son, declined to discuss the auctions.
In two emails, younger son Mark Armstrong of West Chester Township told The Enquirer he and wife Wendy plan to use a portion of their auction proceeds to build a charitable organization called Vantage Earth Foundation focused on the fate of the planet.
Aerospace historian James R. Hansen published his definitive biography, "First Man: The Life of Neil A. Armstrong," in 2005, and the book became a 2018 movie.
"My concern as a historian is that I would want to know if there are any historically significant documents," Hansen said, such as a letter to Armstrong from Charles Lindbergh, the first man to fly solo across the Atlantic in 1927.
Armstrong gave 450 boxes of his papers to his alma mater, Purdue University. In October 2018, the collection's archivist wrote a letter to the Times that the Armstrong auctions were "problematic." The archivist didn't respond to emails for comment.
Mark Armstrong's email outlined dozens of donations and contributions he and his brother have made of their father's possessions. He said they also have ensured that auctioned items have been cataloged for public review.
The Lindbergh letter, for example, has been on loan since June 2017 to the San Diego Air and Space Museum, he said, and will not be in the auction.
In May, the brothers donated the Explorers Club flag "that our father flew on Apollo 11" to the Explorers Club in New York.
About a month ago, Mark Armstrong said, he and his brother made a donation of items to the University of Cincinnati, where their father taught for decades.
Among the goods is a 1971 letter from a key House leader thanking the astronaut for his service to the nation: "Surely NASA's loss is the University of Cincinnati's gain."
In 1978, President Jimmy Carter awarded the first Congressional Space Medal of Honor to Armstrong. That honor now is displayed at the "Destination Moon" exhibit of the Cincinnati Museum Center. Mark Armstrong said he and his brother have offered the medal permanently to the Smithsonian.
Mark Armstrong also listed 30 museums, nonprofits and other groups to which the brothers have loaned items or donated time, money or items.
"Although we are hard-pressed to understand how it is anyone's business what my brother and I decide to do with our personal property, I trust that you will find that these examples indicate that we have been thoughtful about where these historical artifacts should be housed for the long term," Mark Armstrong wrote.
"Furthermore, at our great expense, we made sure that all auctioned items have been researched, restored, preserved and photographed by both (Collectibles Authentication Guaranty, an independent evaluator) and Heritage Auctions, so that this information is accessible to anyone, worldwide."
The "Space Exploration Auction Featuring the Armstrong Family Collection" through Heritage Auctions has already brought in $12.14 million, said spokesman Steve Lansdale. Additional auctions have not been scheduled, but Lansdale said there are more items that could be put up for sale.
Bidding in the fourth auction opens online Friday. Among items available are other commemorative medals in gold and silver, 4-by-6-inch state flags that traveled on Apollo 11, a flight path to the moon that Armstrong drew and signed, an envelope postmarked the day Apollo 11 blasted off and Armstrong's 1951 order for a new Oldsmobile 88 from Niswonger Chevrolet in Wapakoneta.
Not all items on the block are from the Armstrong family. As in the three previous auctions, goods are available that were signed by Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins, the other Apollo 11 astronauts. But all things Armstrong brought the highest prices.
Each of the Apollo 11 astronauts carried a specially struck gold medal. Armstrong's medal, which went to the lunar surface, sold in July for $2.04 million, the biggest individual sale of the auction. An American flag carried on Apollo 11 sold for $275,000.
Armstrong died Aug. 25, 2012, at Mercy Health Fairfield hospital after coronary bypass surgery. Documents show a nurse pulled wires leading to a heart pacemaker, which triggered bleeding around the heart that took more than an hour to stop. Armstrong never regained consciousness, and after his death, he was buried at sea.
In July, The Enquirer reported that Armstrong's sons threatened a wrongful-death lawsuit, and Mercy Health, Ohio's largest hospital system, settled the matter with a $6 million payment to the sons.
Janet Armstrong, Neil's first wife, died in June 2018 at 84. Carol Armstrong, his second wife, lives in Indian Hill.
"Contrary to what you may have heard from others,
my brother and I have been very sensitive to this issue (of the late astronaut's possessions) since my father's passing."

Texto completo: Attorney General William Barr's expanding review of the Russia probe has evolved into a criminal investigation, according to a person familiar with the matter, giving a federal prosecutor who is leading the inquiry the ability to subpoena witnesses and use a grand jury.
It couldn't immediately be determined what prompted the change or what evidence of a crime Mr. Barr and the federal prosecutor leading the probe, John Durham, may have found. When the inquiry was announced in May, Justice Department officials described it as a review that could prompt changes to counterintelligence investigations of political campaigns.
The ramping up of the review into an investigation that could bring criminal charges comes as Congress pursues an impeachment inquiry centered on President Trump's efforts to persuade Ukraine to investigate his political rivals, including former Vice President Joe Biden and his son. Mr. Trump and his Republican allies have long urged the Justice Department to prove whether the president and his associates were unduly targeted for surveillance during the 2016 campaign by biased investigators.
Mr. Barr and Mr. Durham are looking into the underpinnings of the FBI's probe into Russian interference in the U.S. presidential election, a review by the attorney general that has prompted criticism abroad and in the U.S. Mr. Barr has said he wants to understand if the U.S. government's intelligence-gathering efforts in the probe's early stages were legal and appropriate.
It is unclear when the change in the status of the probe, which was earlier reported by the New York Times, occurred.
"These reports, if true, raise profound new concerns that the Department of Justice under Attorney General William Barr has lost its independence and become a vehicle for President Trump's political revenge," said Reps. Jerrold Nadler (D., N.Y.) and Adam Schiff (D., Calif.), chairmen of the Judiciary and Intelligence Committees, respectively.
Meanwhile, Italy's prime minister and high-ranking officials in Australia defended their participation in Mr. Barr's inquiry in the face of attacks by opposition parties and said their governments didnt engage in wrongdoing.
The Italian intelligence services made clear they have no connection to a professor whose encounter with a Trump campaign aide in 2016 helped spur the Federal Bureau of Investigation's counterintelligence probe, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said Wednesday.
During two meetings in Rome in August and September, Mr. Barr expressed interest in London-based academic Joseph Mifsud, who was affiliated with a university in Rome at the time he told a Trump campaign adviser in 2016 that the Russians had "dirt" on Hillary Clinton in the form of thousands of her emails.
The adviser, George Papadopoulos, relayed the tip to an Australian diplomat, who gave the information to the FBI, triggering what later became special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation that ultimately didn't find the Trump campaign conspired with Moscow's election interference.
Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne defended a decision by the country's ambassador to the U.S. to offer to assist in Mr. Barr's review, rather than wait for help to be requested.

Texto completo: The Peters Township Library Foundation's third annual Novel November literary event will host author and Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Anna Quindlen on Nov. 7 at the Peters Township High School auditorium.
Ms. Quindlen, winner of the 1992 Pulitzer Prize for Commentary for her New York Times column "Public and Private," has written several nonfiction books and nine novels, seven of which have appeared on the Times' best-seller list. Her 1994 novel, "One True Thing," was adapted into a film starring Renee Zellweger and Meryl Streep.
Her newest bestseller, "Nanaville: Adventures in Grandparenting," focuses on lessons she has learned from being a grandmother.
Ms. Quindlen said she usually likes to talk about reading rather than writing.
"I find writing difficult, painful and challenging to talk about, since much of what I do happens at an unconscious level," she said. "On the other hand, I find talking about reading simple and joyful."
For example, Ms. Quindlen said she was once asked to write a short book on any subject of her choosing.
"My editor involved said he would give me two weeks to mull it over, and I replied, 'I don't need two weeks,'" she said.
Ms Quindlen said that's how she came to write her 1998 work "How Reading Changed My Life."
Ms. Quindlen said because she spends so much time "alone in a little room staring at a computer screen, wondering whether anyone is reading what I'm writing and whether anything I produce is worth reading in the first place," she enjoys meeting her readers at events like the one upcoming in Peters.
"When gratification finally arrives and you meet readers who have resonated to what you've done, it's second cousin to a birthday party," she said.
Libraries hold a special place in her heart.
"Today, they are the only gathering place in this country at which you are welcome without having to buy anything," she said.
"When I was 11, I went to our local library to see where my books, when I wrote them, would be shelved." Ms. Quindlen recalled her goal that they would be between Marcel Proust and Ayn Rand.
Ms. Quindlen has been focusing on writing novels over the past several years and said she feels blessed to be able to bounce between different forms of writing.
"I find fiction writing more challenging now, and given my feeling that work requires challenge - like a shark I have to keep moving or die - I'm more inclined to novel writing at this point in my life," she said.
The Nov. 7 event will be at 7 p.m. in the Peters Township High School auditorium. Tickets are $20 for adults and $5 for students.
A limited number of VIP tickets will be sold for $60 and will include reserved seating, a pre-event reception and book signing with Ms. Quindlen, passed hors-d'oeuvres by Chef Garnett Livingston, and a copy of one of Ms. Quindlen's books.
A book signing will follow the program, and books will be sold at the event by Riverstone Bookstore.

POP MUSIC; 'Truth' matters as Lizzo files a countersuit; The rapper disputes Raisen brothers' claim that they deserve writing credit on hit.

Texto completo: After finally breaking her silence on a songwriting dispute surrounding her summer smash "Truth Hurts," Lizzo has filed a lawsuit against the Raisen brothers, the L.A.-based songwriters who claim they deserve credit on the track.
The R&B star and rapper took to Twitter on Wednesday to respond to Justin and Jeremiah Raisen's claim that "Truth Hurts" uses material from "Healthy," a 2017 tune they co-wrote with Lizzo. She says the brothers contributed nothing to "Truth Hurts" or its most famous lyric, which is central to the conflict.
Lizzo's suit urges the court to declare that the Raisens have "no ownership rights in" or "right to any sums of money" made from "Truth Hurts"; the singer is also suing the pair for harassment.

"Hey y'all... as I've shared before, in 2017, while working on a demo, I saw a meme that resonated with me, a meme that made me feel like 100% that bitch," Lizzo said in a statement posted on Twitter. "I sang that line in the demo, and I later used the line in Truth Hurts.
"The men who now claim a piece of Truth Hurts did not help me write any part of the song," she continued. "They had nothing to do with the line or how I chose to sing it. There was no one in the room when I wrote Truth Hurts, except me, Ricky Reed, and my tears. That song is my life, and its words are my truth."
"The men" in question were not happy with Lizzo's Twitter statement. Speaking to The Times on Wednesday, the Raisen brothers expressed their disappointment with her remarks, particularly the way she referred to "Healthy" as a demo and didn't mention either of them by name.
"It's not in line with what she stands for and preaches for and is preaching about," Justin Raisen said by phone, with his brother also on the call. "We've said nothing but nice things about her, and now to find out that she's actually pointing her finger at us -- these quote-unquote 'men' -- is extremely saddening, and it's painful ... because people don't do this to other people. It's just not fair. I've never dealt with anything like this in the music industry."
Lizzo's new lawsuit supports her assertion that the Raisens deserve no credit for "Truth Hurts" nor compensation for its chart-topping performance.
"Today we filed a lawsuit on Lizzo's behalf to establish, in a court of law, that the Raisens are not writers of 'Truth Hurts' and have no right to profit from the song's success," said Cynthia Arato, Lizzo's attorney, in a statement to The Times. "The Raisens did not collaborate with Lizzo or anyone else to create the song, and they did not help write any of the material that they now seek to profit from, which is why they expressly renounced any claim to the work, in writing, months ago, as the lawsuit makes abundantly clear.
"Although it is all too commonplace for successful artists to be subjected to these type of opportunistic claims, it is nevertheless disappointing that Lizzo had to take this step to put an end to the Raisens' false claims and their campaign of harassment," the statement concluded.
The suit, provided to The Times, also targets producer-songwriter Justin "Yves" Rothman, who, Lizzo alleges, "later lodged his own copycat claim." In a second interview with The Times on Wednesday after the lawsuit was made public, Justin Raisen said it has inflicted extreme emotional distress and disillusionment.
"It's a complete abuse of power and really, really bad for the music community," Raisen said. "I was honestly sicker than I've [ever] felt. This whole thing has made me honestly not really want to make music as a songwriter or producer as an occupation anymore."
Raisen said he never wanted to end up in court, but Lizzo's legal action has fired him up and he vowed to clear his family name.
"We'll go to court. We'll win. We'll take a lot more money -- not that that's what I want; I just want the right thing to be done," he said. "And then I'll take [Lizzo] to court because I've almost been checked into a psychiatric recovery center twice because of all of this damage and psychological stress I've been through."
The Raisens claim they made several attempts to settle the dispute in private, at one point getting on the phone with Lizzo to talk things over, to no avail. They allege that the hit phrase "I just took a DNA test / Turns out I'm 100% that bitch," only made it into "Healthy" -- and, consequently, "Truth Hurts" -- because Jeremiah Raisen suggested they use it during a songwriting session.
The phrase was inspired by a meme originated by singer Mina Lioness, who, in a Wednesday tweet, thanked Lizzo for giving her a songwriting credit on the hit.
Despite pushback from others in the room, Jeremiah Raisen said he eventually persuaded Lizzo to adopt the catchphrase, which has since become a rallying cry for the artist and appears on her merchandise.
"I was the one who decided that it would be good to be in the song," Jeremiah Raisen told The Times.
The "Juice" singer's suit directly refutes Jeremiah Raisen's account, asserting that the Raisens "did not come up with the idea of including the lyric in the unreleased demo."
"The creator of the tweet is the person I am sharing my success with ... not these men. Period," Lizzo said Wednesday on Twitter. "Thank you to everyone has supported me and my song."
In addition to claiming the brothers "did not collaborate with Lizzo or anyone else to create 'Truth Hurts,'" the suit also contends that the Raisens actually "withdrew any claim to 'Truth Hurts,' in writing, in April of this year, and subsequently assured Lizzo, again in writing, that they were making no claims to the work."
The suit continues: "They commenced an intentionally misleading social media campaign where they falsely claimed to be writers of the song and threatened to expand their intentionally misleading campaign to traditional media and newspaper outlets such as the New York Times; all as part of their effort through duress and intimidation to try and compel Lizzo to comply with their unreasonable demands."
"Truth Hurts," which was released in 2017 but became a hit this year, has spent seven weeks on top of Billboard's Hot 100 chart.

Here to Help; One Thing You Can Do to Counteract Climate Change

You probably recognize it. A sticker on a fridge or a dishwasher: the Energy Star symbol. But what, exactly, does it mean?
Energy Star is an energy efficiency certification program run by the Environmental Protection Agency. To get that sticker, a product must pass independent testing by an E.P.A.-recognized lab.
Energy Star refrigerators today use approximately 50 percent less energy than average ones sold 15 years ago. Energy Star LED light bulbs use up to 90 percent less energy and may last 15 times longer than uncertified ones. The washing machines approved under the program use about 25 percent less energy and 33 percent less water than uncertified ones, on average.
The program goes far beyond appliances, light bulbs and electronics, also certifying everything from roofing panels and insulation to entire apartment buildings. All told, more than 60,000 products bear the Energy Star label, including a dizzying 872 refrigerators and 390 dishwashers. (If you find that total daunting, you can just peruse the year's most efficient products.)
You might assume Energy Star certification applies only to high-end goods, but Jennifer Thorne Amann, director of the buildings program at the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, a nonprofit advocacy group, said that's not necessarily the case. "As we've looked over the years," she said, "we've seen Energy Star products at price points all across the spectrum."
Even if an Energy Star product is more expensive than its uncertified counterpart, the E.P.A. says you'll recoup the cost difference through savings on your utility bills. To help defray the upfront cost of Energy Star products, you can also look for rebates from your utility provider.
What about the planet? Can Energy Star make a difference? Yes, said Ms. Amann, who called it "an extraordinarily effective program."
Ms. Amann underscored the fact that the benefits from energy efficiency go beyond the environment. "We can reduce carbon emissions and other pollution emissions, and save people money at the same time," she said.

It's been a busy week for Exxon Mobil: The company is under scrutiny in Washington and in New York.
In D.C., a congressional hearing on Wednesday focused on the fact that the fossil fuel industry knew about the threat of climate change for a long time, while quietly financing groups that spread climate denial and lobbying to forestall legislative action. The chairman of the House oversight subcommittee on civil rights and civil liberties opened the hearing with a blast, saying, "Oil companies like Exxon knew the scientific reality of climate change 40 years ago but waged a war of deception that cost us precious time in the fight to save our planet."
At the same time, in New York City the company is facing off with the state attorney general's office in a shareholder fraud lawsuit four years in the making that alleges Exxon told investors it was fully accounting for the risks of climate regulation to its business while in practice it was seriously underestimating that risk. The trial is not about climate change denial directly, but instead hinges on New York's Martin Act, which gives the state broad powers to protect shareholders from corporate fraud.
The trial started Tuesday and is expected to last three weeks.
In 2015 The New York Times broke the news that the New York Attorney General had launched a fraud investigation of Exxon Mobil. Our first article stated the investigation focused on "whether statements the company made to investors about climate risks as recently as this year were consistent with the company's own long-running scientific research."
On Tuesday in Manhattan, I was in the courtroom when the case finally came to trial in New York State Supreme Court with opening statements before the presiding judge, Barry Ostrager. Protesters outside chanted "Exxon Knew!" earlier in the day, but their fire was matched by Ted Wells Jr., a lawyer for the company, who suggested that discussion at a 2016 meeting among climate activists about portraying Exxon as "a corrupt institution" was part of a conspiracy to take down the company with a "vilification agenda" that he compared to Russia's interference in the 2016 election.
In the past few years, climate investigations and lawsuits and countersuits have sprawled. Massachusetts attorney general Maura Healey pursued an investigation of her own; she is expected to file a lawsuit in coming days.
The company first filed a suit to derail investigations by New York and Massachusets. Exxon started with a judge in Texas who, after issuing some rulings favorable to the company, ultimately determined that he did not actually have jurisdiction over the case and instead transferred it to a judge in New York who has been decidedly less accepting of Exxon's arguments and dismissed the case. Exxon has appealed the New York judge's decision.
The stakes of this case, only the second climate change case to reach trial, are high: If Justice Ostrager finds that Exxon did mislead shareholders, the state has estimated costs to shareholders of as much as $ 1.6 billion. The company posted earnings of $ 20.8 billion in its most recent year.

Texto completo: The Trump administration plans to end subscriptions to The Washington Post and the New York Times held by federal agencies, the latest sign of presidential displeasure with news coverage he deems unfair.
White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham told the Wall Street Journal that the White House would instruct agencies not to renew their subscriptions to the papers when they come up.
She characterized the decision as a cost-saving measure, telling the Journal that "hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars will be saved" by the cancellations.
Trump has made no secret of his dislike for both newspapers, dubbing the Times "the failing New York Times" and The Post "the Amazon Washington Post" in his frequent broadsides against the two news organizations.
Neither description is accurate: The Times's parent company, the New York Times Co., is highly profitable and its subscription base has been growing smartly, particularly since Trump took office. The Post is owned by Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos but is otherwise unaffiliated with Amazon itself.
Trump turned his animus toward the Times and Post up a notch in an interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity on Monday, saying, "We don't even want [the Times] in the White House anymore. "We're going to probably terminate that and The Washington Post. They're fake."
The White House has already canceled its subscriptions to the papers, according to several accounts.
The two papers have been among the leading news sources in investigating Trump, and have closely covered the impeachment inquiry in the House that threatens his presidency.
The Times won a Pulitzer Prize earlier this year for a series of stories detailing Trump's inheritance from his father and his family's history of using questionable and possibly illegal strategies to avoid taxes.
The Times and The Post shared a Pulitzer in 2018 for documenting Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and its connections to Trump's campaign and his transition team and administration. During the 2016 campaign, both papers aggressively covered allegations that he sexually assaulted women. And The Post's David Fahrenthold won a Pulitzer for coverage "casting doubt on Donald Trump's assertions of generosity toward charities."
Trump responded earlier this year by saying in a tweet that the Pulitzer committee should withdraw the Russia prize awarded to the papers. In June, he tweeted that a Times story about the United States' cyber campaign against Russian targets was "a virtual act of Treason by a once great paper so desperate for a story, any story, even if bad for our Country." He repeated his now-familiar mantra: "Enemy of the people."
It's not clear how many subscriptions federal agencies have to the newspapers, and whether these are to the physical paper itself, to its digital equivalent or to both.
Spokespeople for the Times and Post had no comment.
Presidents have canceled newspapers in fits of pique at their coverage before. President Kennedy canceled the White House's subscription to the New York Herald Tribune in the early 1960s. According to historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. in his account of Kennedy's presidency, "A Thousand Days," Kennedy was angry at the newspaper's editorials about impropriety in his administration, complaining that the newspaper underplayed similar behavior in the Eisenhower administration.
The White House eventually renewed its subscription.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – The Justice Department's politically-charged inquiry into the origins of the Russia investigation has shifted to a criminal probe, a person familiar with the matter said late Thursday.
The move is all but certain to fuel fresh suspicion among Democrats that Attorney General William Barr is providing political cover to President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly disparaged former special counsel Robert Mueller's two-year investigation into the Kremlin's intervention in the 2016 election as a "witch hunt. "
Barr launched the inquiry in April into whether federal investigators abused their surveillance authority as they sought to understand Russia's interference during the 2016 presidential campaign.
Barr later appointed Connecticut's chief federal prosecutor, John Durham, to manage the investigation.
It was unclear Thursday evening when the examination moved from an administrative review to a criminal investigation. The development was first reported by The New York Times.
Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N. C. , praised Barr after news of the criminal investigation broke.
“If true, this shows Bill Barr is doing EXACTLY his job: following the facts,” Meadows, former chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, said on Twitter. “Those who damaged America and broke the law to spread this hoax are about to face accountability. ”
In a joint statement, Reps. Jerrold Nadler, D-N. Y. , and Adam Schiff, D-Calif. , two House chairmen leading wide-ranging investigations of the president, said the news reports raise concerns that Barr’s Justice Department “has lost its independence and become a vehicle for President Trump’s political revenge. ”
"If the Department of Justice may be used as a tool of political retribution or to help the President with a political narrative for the next election, the rule of law will suffer new and irreparable damage,” the chairmen said.
James Baker, the FBI’s former general counsel who oversaw the launch of the Russia investigation, and Michael Bromwich, attorney for former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe, declined to comment.
Barr: 'I think spying did occur'
When he first announced the inquiry during testimony before a Senate subcommittee in April, Barr expressed concern about the FBI's use of surveillance of associates of Trump during the presidential campaign.
At the time, Barr said he did not know whether officials had done anything wrong.
The attorney general said he planned to examine the "genesis and the conduct" of the FBI's investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.
"Spying on a campaign is a big deal," Barr told lawmakers then. "I think spying did occur. The question is whether it was adequately predicated. "
Durham has led several high-profile special investigations, including an examination of the FBI's handling of criminal informants in Boston during the Clinton administration, which led to the prosecution of former agent John Connolly. He led an inquiry during the George W. Bush administration into the CIA's destruction of videotapes depicting the torture of terror detainees.
'The FBI doesn't spy': Comey slams Barr for spying claim, 'misleading' Mueller summary
Trump has asked world leaders to assist inquiry
Barr has personally overseen the inquiry and has sought assistance from law enforcement partners around the globe, including those in Italy and the United Kingdom.
White House officials confirmed last month that Trump had asked multiple countries, including Australia, to help Barr's inquiry.
Spying, treason and politics: President Trump ups the stakes in Russia probe battle despite scant evidence
Australia played a pivotal role in the FBI's decision to launch the initial investigation into Russia interference in 2016.
Australia's top diplomat in the United Kingdom passed information to U. S. authorities after a meeting with George Papadopoulos, a Trump campaign foreign policy adviser. The diplomat said Papadopoulos confided that Russians were offering damaging information on then-Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.
Papadopoulos ended up serving two weeks in prison for lying to FBI agents about his interactions with a Russian national while working for the Trump campaign. Trump has dismissed Papadopoulos as a low-level campaign aide.
He was the first former Trump aide to be sentenced in Mueller's investigation of Moscow's interference operation.
The disclosure about Barr's probe comes as a House impeachment inquiry has elicited damning testimony from current and former Trump administration officials who have outlined the president’s efforts to press Ukraine to investigate political rival and former Vice President Joe Biden – or risk losing millions in military aid.
The impeachment investigation has focused on Trump's July 25 telephone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky. Trump repeatedly invoked Barr's name during the call, indicating that the attorney general would assist a Ukrainian inquiry into an energy company where Biden's son, Hunter Biden, served as a board member.
Neither the former vice president nor his son have been accused of wrongdoing by the Ukrainian government.
Justice Department officials said Barr didn't know Trump had suggested that he work with the Ukrainian president until weeks after the call, and Barr didn't contact Ukrainian officials.
Related probe into surveillance warrants is wrapping up
The Justice Department's inspector general has been conducting a parallel examination to Barr's and is likely to release its own report in a matter of weeks.
Inspector General Michael Horowitz told lawmakers Thursday that his report on the use of surveillance warrants during the Russia investigation is going through a review process that’s “nearing completion,” according to a letter obtained by CBS News.
Horowitz told lawmakers he expects the final report to be released to the public “with few redactions. ”
Horowitz launched his review in March 2018 in response to requests from lawmakers and then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions. The inspector general looked into whether the FBI violated the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, when it sought court-ordered surveillance of former Trump campaign aide Carter Page in late 2016 as part of the Russia investigation.
The surveillance of Page has long animated Trump and Republicans and has fueled claims of spying – even treason – against former top law enforcement officials.

Kelly Ripa, like most celebrities, has no idea she's out of touch

Texto completo: Coastal elites aren't born. They're made.
Television host Kelly Ripa, who boasts a net worth between $75 and $120 million, upset the internet this week by claiming her son is living in "extreme poverty." Speaking with Jimmy Kimmel, Ripa said her son, Michael Consuelos, is financially struggling in his Brooklyn apartment.
"He hates paying his own rent, and he is chronically poor," she said. "I don't think he ever really experienced, you know, extreme poverty like now."
She added that her parents always give her children a card with $20 for Halloween, which Michael has been waiting on to pay his electricity bill. "He's experiencing being an adult," Ripa said.
Viewers quickly grew outraged at the implication that a millionaire's 22-year-old son living in Brooklyn could be struggling as much as, say, a single mother in Harlem.
"She'd be there in a second for him if he was really living in 'extreme' poverty," commented one viewer. "How disrespectful to those that truly are."
iFrame Object
It's commendable that Ripa is trying to teach her son financial lessons by having him pay his own rent and electricity bills. Presumably, though, she still pays his tuition at New York University, which costs over $49,000 per year.
Not to be bullied for calling it as she saw it, Ripa quickly addressed the online outrage with a comment on her Instagram, writing that her son is a senior in college who works full time. She continued:
He is in his first non parent subsidized apt with roommates. I’m used to getting a lot of slack because people love to have fake outrage over something they didn’t see. They only read a headline and wag their tired fingers. I didn’t grow up privileged and neither did [my husband, Mark.] We work and we expect our kids to as well. And the fact that a pack of fools want to bitch about that, i say let em.Instagram
There's no crime in being rich, but there is a problem in pretending that you struggle. A little publicity advice for Ripa: Take the L. Say you're sorry you equated your Brooklynite son's struggles with those of families on food stamps, and move on.
Ripa may be a millionaire now, but she grew up with a stay-at-home mother and a father who drove buses and headed a labor union in New Jersey. So, if she's out of touch, at least she's only recently so.
In a 2001 article from the New York Times, Ripa talks about visiting her parents' home, where she helped her father around the house. ''He never made me clean out the trash cans when I was young,'' Ripa said. The article notes that she is "wondering if her father wanted to be sure she remembers where she comes from."
By making her son pay his own rent, Ripa is channeling her father, trying to remind a privileged child that life still requires work. It's a good aim, but if paying your own rent still seems like a significant trial, Ripa has grown more out of touch than she realizes.
And she's not the only one. When she told Kimmel her son had never experienced living in poverty, he solemnly affirmed, "Of course, when would he have?"
It's incredibly humorous, in a dark sort of way, to watch a couple of rich celebrities bond over the struggles of an NYU student. Yes, they're out of touch. But the worst part is that they don't even know it.

Texto completo: Bárbara Vale y su hijo Jason Vale, ex campeón de lucha libre, fueron arrestados ayer en Queens (NYC) por cargos de fraude por supuestamente vender el elixir de albaricoque en Internet como una cura para el cáncer.
La dama de 77 años y su hijo de 51 fueron arrestados por la federal Administración de Drogas y Alimentos (FDA) y las autoridades del Servicio Postal (USPS), en su casa en Queens.
El Departamento de Protección Ambiental (DEP) de la ciudad de Nueva York estuvo en escena debido a los barriles llenos de líquido encontrados en la casa.
Bárbara Vale apareció en la corte el miércoles por la tarde, donde fue liberada con una fianza de $100 mil dólares, informó NBC News.
Su hijo Jason fue llevado al hospital después del arresto por un problema médico no revelado y no compareció ante el tribunal. El juez lo contactó por teléfono y le informó las mismas condiciones de su fianza de $100 mil dólares.
Según una denuncia penal, desde al menos enero de 2013 el dúo madre-hijo “ha estado operando un negocio en línea a través de un portal llamado “Apricotsfromgod.info“, desde el cual los consumidores pueden comprar diversos productos”.
La queja continúa diciendo: “Uno de estos productos es la amigdalina, un glucósido que se encuentra en el núcleo o las semillas de la mayoría de las frutas y se conoce con frecuencia como “Laetrile” o “Vitamina B-17”. Mientras que algunas personas creen que Laetrile puede tratar y controlar el cáncer, la FDA no respalda esta afirmación”.
Según la denuncia, en 2002 Jason fue acusado de intentar engañar a la FDA y distribuir laetrile, entre otros cargos. Posteriormente fue condenado en 2003 y cumplió cinco años de prisión, según los fiscales.
En 2008 el diario New York Times describió a Jason como un sobreviviente de cáncer que atribuía su recuperación al poder de las semillas de albaricoque.

Building a state better than hate

Texto completo: ST. CLOUD - Kayla Okonu wanted to talk about the racist posters plastered all over town.
"Hate speech is free speech" and "unapologetically white" fluttered from posts and poles all over downtown St. Joseph, Minn. It was February 2018, and a group calling itself the White Student Union had gone leafleting.
Kayla was an eighth-grader. By the time the White Student Union hit town, she knew how it felt to be called racial slurs and have people touch her hair without asking. A classmate said her hair made her look like she'd been "dragged from the rafts of hell." A classmate told her racism didn't exist in America anymore.
But when Kayla asked school administrators to discuss those "You Will Not Replace Us" signs, the answer was no.
"We're not prepared to handle these conversations," Okonu and her mother, Angel Hight, said they were told. "We have teachers who aren't comfortable talking about it."
This week, Kayla tried again.
In a crowded auditorium in St. Cloud, she faced a panel that included both a former neo-Nazi and the state attorney general, and she asked for help.
"I've had racist remarks, I've had people call me [a racial slur], I've had people touch my hair," said Okonu, who's now 14 years old. "I need to feel welcome, and I need to feel accepted."
Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, a black Muslim man from Minneapolis, is leading a statewide conversation on race and hate, one town at a time. For months, he's been hearing stories of hate, hurt and isolation in a state where there's been a 22% jump in reported hate crimes.
The immigrants afraid to answer the knock on the door. The gay students harassed on campus. The family in Fergus Falls whose Labor Day picnic was interrupted by a car full of white men who pulled up to scream a racial slur at them.
At a listening session at a Minneapolis synagogue, another 14-year-old girl talked about the anti-Semitic slurs she hears so often that her friends have started to shrug them off, as if that's just the way the world is now.
The way things are isn't the way things have to be.
Christian Picciolini, a former white supremacist, was recruited into a Chicago skinhead chapter when he was an alienated, bullied 14-year-old. These days, he runs the Free Radicals Project, and he tries to help others escape violent extremist groups and make amends to the people they once terrorized.
For Picciolini, it started with a record shop he opened and stocked with racist music he imported from Europe. But he also stocked a corner of the store with other genres, and the customers who browsed those stacks represented everything he thought he hated. Some were gay, some were black, some were Jewish.
It was, he said, his first meaningful interaction with the people he thought were his enemies.
Eventually, he said, he realized he had more in common with those customers than he did with the hate group he was leading.
"Violence is what we do when we don't know what else to do with our suffering," he said. "Every one of us in this room is failing everyone else in this room. We are all broken."
Picciolini joined Ellison in St. Cloud, a city whose last attempt at a hate-crime forum was postponed by protests; a city known to readers of the New York Times as the place where residents bristle at the sight of Somali-Americans "just walking around."
Tuesday night's forum wasn't about an article in the New York Times, Ellison said, and there's nothing happening in St. Cloud -- good or bad -- that isn't happening everywhere else in Minnesota.
"St. Cloud is not worse than other places," Ellison said. "What we're trying to do is make sure it's a little bit better."
Kayla Okonu, at least, left St. Cloud feeling better than when she arrived.
She's at a new school now, and she's hoping to organize a festival someday to celebrate what her community has in common and rejoice in its differences.
"Coming in, I was so nervous. I was shaking; I was near tears," she said. "After? I was so happy. Everyone was so receptive and so welcoming. … That feeling's so amazing."

Texto completo: So when will Massachusetts land its Wayfair Windfall?
Not anytime soon, it turns out. The US Supreme Court's landmark decision that allowed states to collect sales taxes on a larger volume of online purchases is now more than a year old, long enough for us to get a good glimpse of the riches supposedly pouring into our coffers.
More like a trickle. With Massachusetts adopting new standards this month, I checked in with the state Department of Revenue to find out how much money the state scooped up from retailers that registered as remote sellers in the fiscal year that ended on June 30. This was the first full budget cycle since the Wayfair ruling of June 2018. More important, for Massachusetts, it was also the first year of the so-called cookie tax, a separate effort by the revenue department to collect online sales taxes.
So how much are we talking about? The agency's answer: $60 million.
Don't get me wrong; no one should complain about getting $60 million. But that's barely a rounding error compared to the $6.8 billion in total sales and use taxes that the state collected over the same time. And it also falls far short of earlier estimates, including a widely cited US Government Accountability Office report from 2017 that predicted up to $279 million in new revenue for Massachusetts once these remote sellers started adding to the till.
But expect that $60 million to change — upward. Why? State lawmakers are requiring the revenue department to change the way it collects taxes on remote sales, driven in large part by the Wayfair decision. (Feel free to speak up at a public hearing on Nov. 7.)
Collecting sales taxes through remote sellers has long been a Holy Grail for state tax collectors in this e-commerce age. Before Wayfair, a Supreme Court ruling dating back to the era of catalog sales, the 1992 Quill decision, had been widely considered the law of the land. Quill shielded out-of-state sellers if they did not have a physical presence in a particular state, such as a store or warehouse.
The Massachusetts DOR didn't want to wait for the Wayfair challenge to be resolved. The agency imposed its own “cookie tax," deeming that the files that online sellers place on consumers' phones and laptops created a kind of physical presence under Quill. These cookie rules did not get imposed in October 2017 without controversy: Electronics seller Crutchfield sued to stop them almost immediately, in its home state of Virginia. Earlier this month, a judge there dropped the case on jurisdictional grounds.
Not that it will likely matter in the end. The revenue department's new rules would strike the cookie tax reasoning and get the state in sync with the Wayfair decision. These rules took effect on Oct. 1, but the process to make them permanent is now underway.
The new rules are tougher than the old ones. Under the “cookie tax," remote sellers had to remit to Massachusetts if they had sales totaling $500,000 in the state a year, and made 100 transactions here. Under the new rules, the dollar threshold drops to $100,000. The volume threshold? Gone entirely. Plus, the new regs require online marketplaces (Amazon, Etsy, and the like) to collect and remit taxes on behalf of third-party vendors that use their sites.
Jared Walczak, senior policy analyst at the D.C.-based Tax Foundation, said officials in most states have seen far less online tax revenue than they initially expected when they rejoiced over Wayfair. Collections are falling short of even the low-end scenarios portrayed in that GAO report. (Massachusetts' promised windfall was supposed to be a minimum of $169 million.) Walczak said government officials didn't have a good grasp of just how much they were already collecting in online sales taxes. Amazon collects them across the country as a matter of course, and has been doing so in Massachusetts since 2013. Other brick-and-mortar chains, ranging from Walmart to Bed Bath & Beyond, have gobbled up online-only sellers, so those e-comemrce businesses, too, had started remitting sales taxes under the Quill standard.
The Retailers Association of Massachusetts had once hoped for an additional $300 million a year, post-Wayfair. Not anymore. For now, the group's executives say they're just happy that the playing field has been leveled. Their online rivals need to collect the 6.25 percent, like everyone else around here (except, of course, for stores just over the line in New Hampshire).
The new state budget assumes $42 million in additional sales tax revenue this year because of the reduced threshold and the new rules to capture online marketplace sales. Maybe we will get that much. Maybe not. Either way, anyone waiting for a big Wayfair Windfall will likely be disappointed.

Texto completo: Lynn S. Rosenquest
Lynn (Sippell Roylance) Rosenquest, 96, passed away peacefully at the Phoebe Home in Allentown on Tuesday, October 15th with her children at her bedside. Lynn was born in Manhattan and grew up in New Jersey, before moving to Pennsylvania in 1970. She was employed as an administrative assistant in New York, New Jersey, and the Lehigh Valley. Her most recent employers were the Redevelopment Authority of Allentown and the Unitarian Universalist Church in Bethlehem, where she worked until her retirement.

Lynn was a patron of the arts and progressive causes, and loved poetry, opera, and creating flower arrangements. An avid reader and a great lover of words, her vocabulary was remarkable. She enjoyed The New Yorker and The New York Times, and did the crossword puzzle every week - in ink. She lived independently until age 95, and always hosted family gatherings for birthdays, holidays, and celebrations. She and her late husband Bill owned a house on Long Beach Island, which remains a special place for her family. Cocktails, conversations, and Catch Phrase on the back deck were a highlight of her later years at the beach house.

She is survived by her daughters Cristina Walthier (and husband William) and Sally Kiefer (and husband Bernard); her son Jon Roylance (and wife Mary); her brother John Sippell (and wife Cathy); six grandchildren, Amy Walthier, Ethan Walthier, Jessie Castro (and husband Albert), Alex Kiefer (and fiancé Natasha Stelmak Schabner), Kate Kiefer (and husband Cameron Myers), and Benjamin Roylance; six great-grandchildren, Laura Talaber, Noah Castro, Charlotte Castro, Sophia Schabner, Evelyn Kiefer, and Roger Kiefer-Myers. She was predeceased by her husband R. William; former husband and father of her children Howard Roylance; parents Margaret Selander and Clifford Sippell; and sister Margaret Sippell.

A memorial service is planned for November 9th at 2 p.m. at the Unitarian Universalist Church in Bethlehem. Memorial donations may be made to the ACLU.

Truth about sinking of USS Eagle finally comes out

Texto completo: Some stories are more moving than others when it comes to shipwrecks. This one has really hit home, as in shockingly. Read on ...
On April 23, 1945, the USS Eagle sank off the coast of Maine near Cape Elizabeth. She was towing a practice target for bombers from the nearby Naval Air Station Brunswick.
According to a July 20 article in The New York Times:
"This ship was part of a class of submarine chasers built by the Ford Motor Co. to combat German U-boats in World War I, but saw their first substantial action in World War II."
There were 62 crew members aboard. The mood was light, somewhat relaxed as the men knew World War II was winding down. The word was out that U-boats were close to the Atlantic Coast. What good would it do the Germans to shoot down a submarine chaser, but call attention to the U-boat? After all, seamen on both sides were weary after a long war.
Five miles offshore the German U-853 found its target, the USS Eagle 56, and destroyed her. Only 13 men lived to tell their stories. The Navy's official records listed the cause of sinking as a boiler explosion.
If so, then why did my birth mother (June Kern Davies Williams) tell me 29 years ago that her first husband, and love of her life, Bob Davies, was on the Eagle when it was hit by a German U-boat? Who had she talked to? Survivors? Naval officials? Her mind was very clear about this; the Navy was wrong.
A Court of Inquiry had been formed on April 23, 1945, consisting of U.S. Navy Rear Adm. Felix Gygax; Lt. Cmdr. William Coolidge, naval reserve; and Lt. Cmdr. Norman Kaufman, naval reserve. The purpose was to:
"Make a thorough investigation into all the circumstances connected with the aforesaid loss, the causes thereof, damages to property there from, injuries to personnel, and the responsibility therefore.
"The court will include in its findings a full statement of the facts it may deem to be established."
The Court of Inquiry was held at the First Naval District North Station Office Building in Boston. Eleven pages of questions were asked of the witnesses who were men from the Eagle's base at Grand Trunk Pier in Portland, Maine, and the survivors. Most of the survivors, when asked where they thought the explosion had come from, declared that it had come from outside the ship. Lt. j.g. John P. Scagnalli told the Court of Inquiry that he "felt the explosion was from outside inwards. It was very similar to a depth charge explosion."
Numerous questions were asked about the ship's boiler, but the survivors had similar testimonies, stating that the explosion had been caused by "something outside the ship."
The USS Eagle sank in 15 minutes in 300 feet of water. The testimony recorded that the deceased men had died immediately; the survivors were able to swim away from the ship. This tragedy occurred less than a month before the war ended. In retaliation, the German U-boat 853 was sunk by the Americans two weeks later.
Until she died in 2019, June Kern Davies Williams insisted the Eagle had been torpedoed. Reticent to talk about her teenage pregnancy, giving up the baby for adoption and the loss of her husband, no one ever questioned her further. The official version was still that the boiler explosion caused the sinking.
No one could determine the exact location for 75years. Eight civilian divers finally found the USS Eagle 56 . The group was composed of diving and sonar experts. Ryan King, a member of the team photographers, told The New York Times that "When you see a 4-inch deck gun, you know you're not dealing with a fishing boat. The Eagle is located down in a rocky cavern at the bottom of the Atlantic. Experts took their findings to the Navy. The site is not for recreational divers, and is protected by federal law as a war grave.
Historian and lawyer Paul M. Lawton from Warren, Massachusetts, had been interested in finding the ship for two decades after hearing about it from two friends whose father had died aboard when the ship was torpedoed. Gary Kozak lent his knowledge as an expert in side-scan sonar, searching for five years with no luck. Three of the survivors were interviewed, but no new clues were revealed. Photographer Ryan King dove the site and did much of the photography which identified the lost ship.
"The Hunt for Eagle 56" is a three-part documentary produced by the Smithsonian Channel. It is well worth watching. Questions outnumber answers at times. Why did the Navy insist a boiler had exploded when survivors thought and had seen both the submarine and a torpedo? Could there have been a cover up for some reason?
The official finding of the Eagle marks the first time in the history of the Navy that such a correction has ever been made. The official cause of the sinking of the Eagle has been changed to being torpedoed by a German U-boat.
Docents at the New Jersey Maritime Museum are extremely well informed in various parts of our state's maritime history. They have had experiences diving, antique postcard collecting, researching wrecks, writing and are experts in many fields. Now this author has found that her birth mother actually lived the sinking of the Eagle at the age of 21 when her husband of two years died aboard the ship less than a month before the official end of World War II.
What story will be uncovered next? On your next visit to the NJ Maritime Museum bring us your stories; we want to hear them. And we will tell you some of ours. NJ Maritime Museum, 528 Dock Road, Beach Haven, open Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Weekdays by appointment, call 609-492-0202.

Is Popularity Of Baseball In Decline?

Texto completo: Major League Baseball and its fans have raised alarms in recent years over a perceived decline in the popularity of baseball in the United States. Falling attendance, poor World Series ratings and a lack of nationally recognized stars are often cited as evidence of the sport's impending collapse.
However, if viewed through the lens of total tickets sold and local television ratings, a somewhat more optimistic picture emerges: one of strong, local fan bases -- and a national following that could have a lot more room to grow.
It's well documented that attendance at Major League Baseball games has been declining since 2012. About 68.5 million fans attended major league games during the 2019 regular season, down from a peak of nearly 80 million in 2007.
But M.L.B. cashes in on its sheer volume of games, vastly outperforming the N.F.L. and the N.B.A in ticket sales every year. M.L.B. teams play at least 2,430 regular-season games each season, compared with only 256 regular-season games for the N.F.L. and 1,230 for the N.B.A. Even the 160 M.L.B.-affiliated minor league teams sold nearly 50 million tickets in 2017.
A lot of people are going to a lot of baseball games.
Tom Brady vs. Mike Trout
A major concern for baseball is the meager national profiles of its stars. By nearly any measure, pro football and pro basketball players outpace baseball players in national popularity.
According to YouGov's ratings of active sports personalities, 91 percent of Americans have heard of LeBron James and 88 percent have heard of Tom Brady, but only 43 percent have heard of Mike Trout of the Los Angeles Angels, baseball's best player.
You don't have to look any further than the national reach of each league's television broadcasts to see why this may be the case.
An analysis by The New York Times of television broadcasts by county shows how widespread the broadcasts of the N.F.L. and N.B.A. stars are -- and how minimal they are for baseball's stars like Trout.
Few of Trout's games are shown outside Southern California. For example, only six of his 162 games in 2018 were aired in Chicago. By contrast, 42 percent of LeBron James's 82 games and 56 percent of Tom Brady's 16 games were aired there.
Since even baseball's best players rarely get airtime in markets outside their own, baseball struggles to promote its national stars on the same level as other sports do.
Over the past several seasons, baseball has tried to broaden the reach of its stars. But there may be no better solution than to find ways to let fans actually watch them play.
Baseball Is Local
Further evidence of the local nature of baseball's fandom can be seen in Google searches. Teams like the Detroit Tigers and Colorado Rockies have very little following outside their areas and a few neighboring states compared with the N.F.L. teams from the same city. The Rockies, for instance, aren't as popular across the country, but they get more searches in Colorado than the N.F.L.'s Broncos do.
The Pros and Cons of Local Broadcasting
Fox, ESPN, CBS and NBC own the national broadcasting rights for N.F.L. games, giving wide exposure to the league's best teams and stars. Baseball's broadcasting model is much different. Individual teams sell exclusive rights for nearly all of their games to either regional branches of these national networks or to local stations.
Although baseball's national TV ratings lag far behind those of other top sports, these local broadcasts are very popular.
According to Nielsen ratings:
In 2019, 12 of the 29 United States-based major league teams were the most popular prime-time broadcast in their market.
An additional seven teams ranked in the top three in prime time.
On cable, 24 major league teams ranked first in their market in prime time.
M.L.B. ranked first over all on cable in every major league market in the United States except Miami.
Again, baseball is relying on its high volume of games (one nearly every day for six months). But the fact remains that people spend many more hours watching their home team than other prime-time shows.
This works well for the regional networks -- many of which are owned, at least in part, by the teams themselves.
The local popularity of baseball partially explains the poor World Series ratings in recent years. After following their home team for 162 games, fans may be unlikely to sit through a series between two teams they have rarely seen play and with 50 players whose names they may barely recognize. Instead, they'll wait until next season, and tune back in to their local station.

Texto completo: On Jan. 15, 1969, University of Pittsburgh senior Joe McCormick and his fellow activist students would have had an unscheduled day off from class, and the course of Pitt's history would have continued apace had Chancellor Wesley Posvar cancelled classes that day. It was the first birthday of the late Martin Luther King Jr. after his 1968 assassination.
Mr. McCormack, then-chair of the undergraduate Black Action Society, and his organization's members insisted that the new chancellor, a Rhodes Scholar and retired Air Force general, cancel classes to honor the murdered civil rights pastor. The chancellor declined, and the African American students invoked the "action" in BAS' name.
Likely unable to replicate one particular "action" today as a senior citizen, Mr. McCormack and company climbed eight flights of the university's Cathedral of Learning to the computer center to commandeer it peacefully and issue demands in support of a black agenda. "We took the stairs instead of the elevators to avoid campus police challenging a group of black kids," recalled Mr. McCormack 50 years later. This was not a trivial consideration.
In the year leading up to the Pitt computer takeover and the years immediately following, American higher education was discombobulated by wild confrontations between students and authorities that were marked by violent campus disruptions and threats thereof; weapons brandishing, protracted standoffs, official precautionary closings and even death itself. The mayhem - largely ignited by white as well as black young people, though rarely together - invaded colleges from California to New York.
No sector of higher learning was immune. State colleges, private research universities and Ivy League schools were ensnared in the turmoil. San Francisco State experienced five months of fruitless negotiations with blacks and Latinos in 1968. White student protesters at Columbia became (in)famous for their media-savvy takeover skills in 1968. In 1970, white New York University students and young faculty affixed bombs to the computer they "kidnapped," demanding that a $100,000 ransom be paid, according to The New York Times.
An incredulous America watched as black Ivy Leaguers with rifles took control of Cornell in 1969. Most tragically, in 1970, four unarmed white students were murdered in cold blood by the Ohio National Guard during a campus protest at Kent State. These incidents highlighted most profoundly the Vietnam, civil rights and national culture wars, changing the American academy forever.
Three essential features of the 1969 Pitt uprising, however, rendered it short and successful: In the land of the blue and gold, commitment to nonviolence, determination toward change and intelligent negotiation freed the computer center by 3 a.m. without physical harm to anyone or anything.
A seven-point agreement to improve black life on Pitt's predominately white campus was signed by Chancellor Posvar. "It continued to be my view that any commitments made under duress are illegitimate, and the agreements we made last night are legitimate," he wrote in a contemporaneous account of the hours-old rapprochement, detailed in his unpublished memoir.
Perhaps his reflection took cognizance of the astonishing accomplishments the University of Pittsburgh and African Americans had achieved together over the previous three decades, and maybe the retired chancellor portended the 21st-century victories still to come.
A new documentary produced by Pittsburgh's On Motion Media for the Pitt Alumni Association's African American Alumni Council recounts the events of the 1969 computer takeover at Pitt and the remarkable changes in black life there in the ensuing 50 years. The world premiere of "Blue, Gold&Black: From Uprising to Still Rising" will be presented during Pitt's Homecoming weekend on Oct. 25.
The production commemorates the 50th anniversary of the takeover in a tribute that neither saccharin-coats the realities of trying to pervasively diversify Pitt since it graduated its first black student - John Paul Golden in 1888 from what became Pitt's medical school - nor self-flagellates in penance for the school's shortcomings. The documentary does trumpet the university's progress in black student recruitment, faculty and administrator hiring, and Afro-centric academic program offerings, all objectives of the uprising and its settlement.
Obviously, black students attended Pitt before 1969. And the School of Social Work even had a black assistant dean, Mary Ella Robertson, in 1963. But the documentary establishes that the mind-boggling achievements by Pitt and African Americans together in the last half-century vindicate the 1969 peace pact.
Pitt's Nobel Peace Prize laureate, Heisman Trophy winner, double Olympic Gold medalist, first National Book Award winner and two MacArthur Fellows are black male and female alumni exclusively. African American students dominate among Pitt's Rhodes, Marshall, Truman and Goldwater Scholarship recipients. Each exemplar was recognized between the last quarter of the 20th century and today, the highest academically achieving students enticed to Pitt by the strategies of then-Vice Provost Jack Daniel, who as a young professor mediated the 1969 deal.
Patrick Gallagher, Pitt's current chancellor, dismisses as serendipity, not strategy, the irony of his 2019 appointment of a heavily credentialed black vice chancellor, Mark Henderson, to run the very same university computing operation exactly 50 years after the 1969 computer center was briefly held hostage by black students. Mr. Gallagher observes of the progress African American activism wrought at Pitt, "A great university belongs in the turbulence of the day. That's where the challenges are, and that's where I hope we are."
"Blue, Gold&Black: From Uprising to Still Rising" will be shown Saturday at the University of Pittsburgh in Alumni Hall's first floor admissions suite. The event is free and open to the public.

Texto completo: Nashville vet Michaela Anne can't hide her disdain for the country music industry. One can stay submerged in it for so long, focusing on glittery illusions (such as the favorable New York Times review awarded her sophomore album, 2014's "Bright Lights and the Fame") until one runs out of oxygen. "Meanwhile, everything was falling apart all around me," she says, sighing. "The label dropped out, the publicist dropped out, there was no tour support to speak of, and I was playing to three people per date." She resolved to try something drastically different with the forlorn, canyon-echoey "Desert Dove," her new album on Yep Roc Records.
You had a daredevil plan for Desert Dove - you doubled down. I finally realized that this might be a lifetime of hardship - half amazing, but half really f-hard, so did I want to still be in this? And I didn't have a plan B. I went to school, I have two degrees - I got a degree in jazz vocal performance and a degree in sociology and history, so I have the resources and skills to possibly do something else, but I couldn't imagine what. So I made the decision that music and all of its good parts outweigh all of the struggles, even if I play tiny clubs the rest of my life. When it got to the point of making a new record, and whether I should crowdfund it or not, I thought, "OK, if I'm not going to risk it all, how could I expect other people to believe in me if I don't gamble on myself?"
Then what? I took out a bunch of credit cards and I made this record. With no label, not knowing what was going to happen. I was determined to not ask for help from anybody, but I was panicking the whole time, thinking, "What if this doesn't work out?" But I kept doing everything with the intention and the mindset that it is going to work out. And I'm lucky, because I'm married to another musician, Aaron Sha-fer-Haiss, and we were miraculously able to buy a house before Nashville prices got insane.
Why record out here in San Clemente? Kelly Winrich, who co-produced the record, he's from there and his family built this studio in their basement. He lives in New York, but he said, "We can make the album here in Brooklyn, or at my parents' studio on the beach." And I said, "That's a no-brainer. We're going to California!"

Texto completo: NEW YORK - As Lupita Nyong'o accepted an award from the Harlem School of Arts - and entered the stage to Beyonce's anthemic hit "Brown Skin Girl" - the actress mainly had two people to thank for fueling her passion for the arts as a child: her parents.
"I was thinking about (the Harlem School of Arts) and what it does for children and its students (and) I didn't have an institution where I'm from in Nairobi, Kenya. And so the only way my interest in the arts thrived was because I had parents who valued those interests," she said Monday night at the school's annual Mask Ball in New York City. "And my mother in particular, she really nurtured my artistic spirit."
The Oscar winner's mother, Dorothy, also received the Visionary Lineage Award alongside her daughter.
"I really didn't do much," Dorothy Nyong'o said to laughs from the audience. Dorothy Nyong'o said she noticed her daughter's interest in the arts as a child and so she looked "for opportunities to nurture that."
"My job was really to facilitate it, and I'd like to encourage parents to do it. Sometimes we make the mistake of trying to make our children what we think we want," she said.
Dorothy Nyong'o won over the audience with more sweet words for her daughter, who has appeared in films such as "Black Panther," "Star Wars," "Us" and "12 Years a Slave," for which she won an Oscar.
"I'm proud of her. She makes me shine."
Lupita Nyong'o, 36, thanked her mom for all of her support, explaining that when she was a teenager, her mother "drove to rehearsals after a long day at work" and sat "in the car for five or so hours and she never complained."

Book him: Former acting solicitor general of the U.S. and MSNBC commentator Neal Katyal has written "Impeach: The Case Against Donald Trump." The book, co-written with Sam Koppelman, comes out Nov. 26. Last month, Katyal wrote a New York Times op-ed piece in which he condemned Trump's "brazen conduct" and said impeachment was warranted even if he didn't commit an actual crime.

Texto completo: The White House will follow through on President Trump's threat to cancel his subscription to the New York Times and Washington Post, which he called "fake" newspapers.
The administration confirmed the news Tuesday to Politico after the president told Fox News host Sean Hannity that he may terminate his subscriptions to the outlets, which he claimed were consistently "wrong" about his presidency.
"All these people doing it for the New York Times, which is a fake newspaper, we don’t even want it in the White House anymore. We’re gonna probably terminate that and the Washington Post. They’re fake," he said.
The statement came as the president fired off on the media for its coverage of his impeachment inquiry and the corruption accusations the president has made against Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden.
Trump called the media "corrupt" and said CNN's Anderson Cooper was having to "apologize" during the debate for asking Biden about his son's business dealings.
Democrats opened impeachment proceedings against Trump after he asked Ukraine's president to investigate the Bidens over potential corruption.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration on Tuesday moved to weaken protections for a threatened California fish, a change that would allow large amounts of water to be diverted from the San Francisco Bay Delta to irrigate arid farmland and could harm the region's fragile ecosystem.
The plan, which administration officials expect to be finalized in January, is a major victory for a wealthy group of California farmers that had lobbied to weaken protections on the fish, the delta smelt. It also might intensify ethics questions about Interior Secretary David Bernhardt, who was the lobbyist for those farmers until just months before he joined the Trump administration.
Federal investigators are looking into whether Mr. Bernhardt's efforts at the Interior Department to weaken protections for the fish violated "revolving-door" rules designed to prevent former lobbyists from helping past clients from within the government. Investigators also are looking into whether he improperly continued lobbying for those farmers even after he de-registered as a lobbyist just before joining the Trump administration.
The delta smelt, an unassuming, finger-size fish with little utility beyond its role as an environmental sentry, has been at the center of California's water wars for nearly three decades. The "biological opinion" -- released jointly on Tuesday by the Interior Department and the Commerce Department -- reverses scientific findings made a decade ago, which granted Endangered Species Act protections for certain types of West Coast salmon and the smelt.
Those protections ensured that the California rivers and bays in which the fish swim would get preference over irrigation systems in times of drought. Multiple scientific reports have concluded that diverting those waters could threaten water birds and killer whales, harm commercial fisheries and promote toxic algal blooms.
The new biological opinion concluded that those salmon and smelt would not be jeopardized by lifting the environmental protections and rerouting that water. Once finalized, the change propelled by the opinion would allow water to be diverted from fish to farms by the spring of 2020.
In a prepared statement, the Interior Department's Fish and Wildlife Service wrote that the new findings followed "robust scientific review" and that the changes "will not jeopardize threatened or endangered species or adversely modify their critical habitat."
"The new operations plan that has emerged includes more nimble and responsive water project operations that both protect endangered fish and allow the flexibility to quickly adapt to changing conditions -- like the variable weather in California -- to ensure effective and efficient water supply management," the statement said.
Paul Souza, a deputy assistant director of the Fish and Wildlife Service, said on a telephone call with reporters that the Interior secretary's prior lobbying work did not influence the new decision. "There is absolutely no connection," he said. "We are career professionals. We have led this effort with our teams over the past year, and this is career professional documentation."
While the delta smelt serves no commercial purpose, decisions impacting its habitat extend directly to the interests competing for California's water: farmers, fishermen and environmentalists.
"This is the most contested water problem in California," said Jeffrey Mount, a water policy expert with the Public Policy Institute of California. "The fundamental water question is how much water you allocate to the environment and how much you allocate to farms. This tilts the balance to farms. And this was at the directive of the Trump administration."
Environmental groups again accused the administration of favoring preferred constituents over science.
The conclusion "flies in the face of the best available science, which indicates that stronger protections are needed to prevent the extinction of our native fish and wildlife, like endangered winter-run chinook salmon and delta smelt, particularly in light of the effects of climate change," said Doug Obegi, an expert in California water law with the Natural Resources Defense Council, an advocacy group.

It also brings both Mr. Bernhardt and his former lobbying client a big step closer to the outcome they have sought for years.
From 2011 to 2016, Mr. Bernhardt lobbied on behalf of California's Westlands Water District, a state-chartered organization representing about 1,000 large farmers in an area of central California the size of Rhode Island. During those years, Westlands, which was his largest client, paid Mr. Bernhardt's firm $ 1.3 million.
The group's chief lobbying goal was to lift federal environmental protections to allow California's fickle water supply to be used consistently to irrigate Central Valley almond, pistachio and cotton farms. As Westlands' lawyer and lobbyist, Mr. Bernhardt pressed Congress for legislation to weaken Endangered Species Act protections on the delta smelt. He also joined a legal petition asking the Supreme Court to take up a case seeking to weaken those protections.
A New York Times investigation earlier this year revealed that four months after Mr. Bernhardt was confirmed as the deputy secretary of the Interior Department in August 2017, he telephoned the top Interior Department official charged with overseeing those protections and ordered him to begin the process of creating a new biological opinion document on the smelt.
In June, scientists working on that process produced a draft biological opinion that largely upheld existing findings: removing environmental protections for the smelt and rerouting the water would severely harm the surrounding ecosystem.
Tuesday's new biological opinion rejects that draft and appears to be the culmination of Mr. Bernhardt's efforts.
An Interior Department ethics lawyer, Edward McDonnell, did give Mr. Bernhardt verbal approval to get involved in the matter, but independent ethics specialists have said that, under the terms of the Trump administration's ethics pledge, which Mr. Bernhardt signed, he should not have been given clearance to act. The pledge's "revolving door' provision requires former lobbyists to recuse themselves for two years from any particular matter or specific issue on which they lobbied in the two years before joining the administration.
The now-repudiated draft, obtained by The New York Times, concluded that lifting delta-smelt protections would jeopardize several types of salmon in the Sacramento River, an outcome that the salmon fishing industry has said could devastate the business. The decline of the salmon population would in turn threaten the Southern Resident Killer Whales, which live off the Pacific Coast.
That draft report was never publicly released, but the scientists working on it were reassigned and replaced, according to a report by The Los Angeles Times.

In Boston and Hong Kong, debate over masks

Texto completo: It's nearly Halloween, so what better time for the Metro Minute to dive into the meaning of masks.
At a spirited hearing Monday, Boston city councilors debated a proposal to ban the wearing of masks in public spaces. As the Globe's Milton Valencia reported, proponents say protesters should not be allowed to conceal their identities when committing violent acts, as some did at the so-called Straight Pride Parade in August. Opponents say the rule would limit free expression.
Eight thousand miles away in Hong Kong, the legality of face masks has been a topic of sharp debate amid the violent pro-democracy protests roiling the semi-autonomous territory.
Hong Kong's besieged leader, Carrie Lam, instituted a ban on masks at rallies earlier this month, calling the move “an effective deterrent to radical behavior." Paint is included in the definition of “face covering."
The sweeping ordinance used in Hong Kong dates to 1922, when it was a British colony, and has not been used since deadly riots in the late 1960s.
Protesters have flouted the ban, even at peaceful marches, fearing retribution at work or being denied access to schooling, public housing and other government-funded services. Many are also concerned their identities could be shared with the Communist Party's massive state-security apparatus in mainland China, where high-tech surveillance, including facial recognition technology, is ubiquitous.
Some young protesters wear full gas masks and goggles to protect against tear gas. Others defy the ban with humor, donning Guy Fawkes, Winnie the Pooh, and LeBron James masks at rallies.
In the US, many states already have variations of anti-mask laws. Massachusetts, for example, exacts tougher punishments when a mask is used in a crime.
In Alabama, it has been illegal since 1949 to wear a mask in public except for such occasions as Halloween and Mardi Gras. That law was enacted in direct response to the Ku Klux Klan. In Ohio, it is illegal for two or more people to wear “white caps, masks or other disguises" while committing a misdemeanor.
California had a broad anti-mask law for decades until the Iranian revolution in 1979. Iranian-Americans sued to block the law, saying it kept them from shielding their identities for safety purposes in protests against the new leadership in Iran. The law was struck down.

Anonymous author of Trump 'resistance' op-ed to publish a tell-all book

Texto completo: The author of an anonymous column in The New York Times in 2018, who was identified as a senior Trump administration official acting as part of the "resistance" inside the government, has written a tell-all book to be published next month.
The book, titled "A Warning," is being promoted as "an unprecedented behind-the-scenes portrait of the Trump presidency" that expands upon the Times column, which ricocheted around the world and stoked the president's rage because of its devastating portrayal of Donald Trump in office.
The column described Trump's leadership style as "impetuous, adversarial, petty, and ineffective," and noted that "his impulsiveness results in half-baked, ill-informed, and occasionally reckless decisions that have to be walked back."
The author of the column, which was titled "I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration" and was published Sept. 5, 2018, was known to the Times but identified by the Times only as a senior official in the Trump administration. The person has not been publicly identified.
Trump lashed out at the anonymous author after the column's publication. The president questioned both whether the author existed and whether the author had committed treason. He also demanded on Twitter that the Times turn over "the GUTLESS anonymous person" to the government "at once." The Times did not.
The forthcoming book will list the author as "Anonymous." Although the person does not reveal their identity in the book, they will discuss the reasons for their anonymity, according to people involved in the project.
"Picking up from where those first words of warning left off, this explosive book offers a shocking, firsthand account of President Trump and his record," reads a statement about the book's release.
The book will be published on Nov. 19 by Twelve, an imprint of Grand Central Publishing/Hachette Book Group. It comes at a treacherous period for Trump, as the House continues its fast-moving impeachment inquiry into the president's alleged abuse of power.
There is no modern historical parallel for a firsthand account of a sitting president written in book form by an anonymous author. Many senior government officials, including some who served in the Trump administration, have written books under their own names. Many more have shared information with journalists on the condition of anonymity, perhaps most famously the official known as Deep Throat who was a key source for Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein's reporting in The Washington Post on the Watergate scandal.
The 1996 publication of "Primary Colors: A Novel of Politics" caused a sensation in part because of the anonymity of its author, who was later revealed to be columnist Joe Klein. The book was a work of fiction, although its characters and events mirrored Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign.
The anonymous author of "A Warning" did not take an advance and intends to donate some of the royalties to nonprofit organizations that focus on government accountability and supporting truth-tellers in repressive countries, including the White House Correspondents' Association, said literary agent Matt Latimer, who represented the author along with Keith Urbahn.
Latimer and Urbahn represented fired FBI director James Comey and former White House aide Cliff Sims for their memoirs from their time in the Trump administration.
Washington Post
GOP senator criticized for posting debunked image
MINNEAPOLIS — Representative Ilhan Omar has condemned a Republican state senator from North Dakota who posted a long-debunked photo on his Facebook page that purports to show the Minnesota Democrat holding a weapon at an Al Qaeda training camp.
Omar, a naturalized US citizen who was born in Somalia and is one of the first Muslim women elected to Congress, blasted state Senator Oley Larsen's post, which also led to calls Tuesday from the Senate's top Republican and GOP Governor Doug Burgum to apologize and relinquish a state Senate leadership position.
"This is pure propaganda designed to stir up hate and violence," Omar tweeted Monday night. ". . . Facebook's unwillingness to crack down on hate speech and misinformation is not just threatening my life, but our democracy."
The image Larsen posted has been debunked by several sources since it appeared on social media this summer. It's an Associated Press photo taken of a female Somali army recruit at a Mogadishu military training campus in 1978, four years before Omar was born in 1982.
In the comments accompanying his post, Larsen also called Omar an "elected terrorist" and asked his followers to "share it everywhere."
Facing mounting criticism, though, Larsen removed the photo Monday. And by Tuesday morning, his Facebook feed — minus the image — was full of attacks on him for posting it and accusing him of bigotry.
On Tuesday, the North Dakota Senate's majority leader, Republican Rich Wardner, called on Larsen to apologize and give up his position as the state Senate's president pro tempore, a post in which he presides over sessions when the lieutenant governor is absent.
"At this point, I'm not calling for his resignation from the Senate, but if he continues with this, I will have to rethink that," Wardner said.
Associated Press
Esper recuses himself over son's work with bidder
Defense Secretary Mark Esper has recused himself from a high-profile review of the Pentagon's controversial JEDI cloud computing infrastructure because his son is employed with one of the contract's initial bidders, a Defense Department spokesman said Tuesday.
Moving forward the review is to be handled by deputy defense secretary David Norquist "out of an abundance of caution," Defense spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said in statement e-mailed to reporters.
"Although not legally required to, [Esper] has removed himself from participating in any decision making following the information meetings, due to his adult son's employment with one of the original contract applicants," he wrote.
The statement did not say which company Esper's son works for, how that information came to the Secretary's attention, or why he didn't recuse himself earlier.
It is the latest conflict of interest allegation to present problems for the JEDI contract, which seeks to centralize the military's computing infrastructure in the hands of a tech company, allowing US military agencies to harness the most advanced innovations Silicon Valley has to offer.
Amazon and Microsoft are the only companies eligible to win the massive award, after Oracle and IBM were cut from the competition. Amazon is widely seen as a front-runner.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump is right: The deep state is alive and well. But it is not the sinister, anti-democratic cabal of his fever dreams. It is, rather, a collection of patriotic public servants — career diplomats, scientists, intelligence officers and others — who, from within the bowels of this corrupt and corrupting administration, have somehow remembered that their duty is to protect the interests, not of a particular leader, but of the American people.
Fiona Hill, Michael McKinley and the whistleblower who effectively initiated the impeachment investigation — when these folks saw something suspicious, they said something. Their aim was not to bring down Trump out of personal or political animus but to rescue the Republic from his excesses. Those who refuse to silently indulge this president’s worst impulses qualify as heroes — and deserve our gratitude.
Throughout the Trump presidency, there has been a trickle of fed-up individuals willing to step up and protest the administration’s war on science, expertise and facts.
In July, Rod Schoonover left his job as an analyst for the State Department after the administration blocked the submission to Congress of his report on the national security implications of climate change.
Also in July, Joel Clement, formerly the director of the Office of Policy Analysis at the Interior Department, filed a whistleblower complaint alleging that the administration had reassigned him to an accounting position in retaliation for publicly speaking out on the potential dangers of climate change to Alaska Native communities.
In August, Lewis Ziska, a veteran plant physiologist with the Agriculture Department, quit in protest over the administration’s efforts to bury his findings about the negative effect of rising levels of carbon dioxide on the nutrient content of rice. “You get the sense that things have changed, that this is not a place for you to be exploring things that don’t agree with someone’s political views,” Ziska told Politico at the time. “That’s so sad. I can’t even begin to tell you how sad that is.”
With an impeachment inquiry underway in the House, the risks of breaking ranks with the president are higher than ever. Trump prides himself on punching back against perceived enemies, publicly suggesting that “spies” and “traitors” and people who turn “rat” deserve to have their lives and their families destroyed. Small wonder that few congressional Republicans have dared express even gentle concern over Trump’s increasingly erratic behavior.
But still the patriots come. Top of the list, of course, is the still-anonymous whistleblower who touched off the impeachment drama by registering his concerns about Trump’s clandestine effort to pressure Ukraine into conducting investigations that would benefit his reelection campaign. The concerns enumerated in the complaint have since been verified and magnified by multiple administration insiders, despite the White House’s stonewalling mandate.
On Monday, Congress heard from Hill, the former top national security adviser on Russia and Europe, who detailed how Trump had done an end run around his own national security team, putting Ukraine policy in the hands of unqualified dilettantes like Gordon Sondland, whose $1 million donation to the Trump inaugural basically bought him the title of ambassador to the European Union, and Rudy Giuliani, the president’s personal lawyer and favorite henchman.
On Wednesday, McKinley, a top adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo until this month, told Congress that he had resigned in frustration over the administration’s disparaging and shunting aside career diplomats, as well as its using ambassadors overseas to advance the president’s reelection aims. (He put it more diplomatically, as one would expect.)
A week and a half ago, Marie Yovanovitch, the former ambassador to Ukraine, testified that Trump prematurely recalled her in May, allegedly as a result of a whisper campaign by Giuliani and some of his associates, two of whom were arrested Oct. 9 on federal charges of violating campaign finance laws. “I do not know Mr. Giuliani’s motives for attacking me,” Yovanovitch told lawmakers. “But individuals who have been named in the press as contacts of Mr. Giuliani may well have believed that their personal financial ambitions were stymied by our anti-corruption policy in Ukraine.”
Presumably, Yovanovitch, a veteran diplomat and actual expert on Ukraine, had also proved an annoying hindrance to Giuliani pursuing his shadow agenda.
Right on cue, Trump’s lackeys are responding to such breaches of fealty by going on the attack. In a media briefing on Thursday, the White House acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, dismissed the witnesses who had spoken to impeachment investigators: “What you are seeing now, I believe, is a group of mostly career bureaucrats who are saying, ‘You know what, I don’t like President Trump’s politics, so I’m going to participate in this witch hunt.’”
That may be what Mulvaney hears when he listens to these men and women. But many, many others will hear veteran public servants appalled by an administration that continues to subvert the public interest to the whims of a president who has mistaken himself for a king.
This is Trump’s deep state. For the sake of the nation, the American public should be clamoring for more patriots to join the conspiracy.

Texto completo: El alto funcionario anónimo del gobierno del presidente Donald Trump –que publicó un artículo en The New York Times— tiene una nueva sorpresa para el mandatario. Mejor dicho, le tiene Una advertencia, como se titula el libro que publicará en noviembre.
El misterioso personaje se volvió famoso tras publicar aquella editorial donde habla sobre el movimiento dentro de la Casa Blanca que busca asegurar el éxito del Gobierno estadounidense.
“Para ser claros, la nuestra no es la ‘resistencia’ popular de la izquierda” , dice aquella pieza publicada en septiembre de 2018 . “Queremos que la administración tenga éxito y creemos que muchas de sus políticas ya han hecho que Estados Unidos sea más seguro y más próspero” .
CNN obtuvo la portada del libro, el cual había sido un secreto, pero será lanzado el 19 de noviembre.
“Se han tomado fuertes precauciones para proteger la identidad del autor” , dijeron fuentes a la televisora.
Un borrador de un comunicado de prensa de la editorial Twelve describe el libro como como impactante.
“Retomando de donde se quedaron esas primeras palabras de advertencia, este libro explosivo ofrece una impactante historia de primera mano del presidente Trump” , indica.
Los editores afirman que el autor no publica el libro por dinero y que incluso analiza la intención de donar gran parte de las ganancia a la Asociación de Corresponsales de la Casa Blanca y otras organizaciones que luchan por la libertad de prensa.
También se desconoce si el autor continúa en la Administración Trump, además de que la Casa Blanca declinó hacer comentarios.

China mess won't blow over quickly

Texto completo: Adam Silver went on ESPN's Get Up on Monday morning, mostly to continue expressing his wish that everyone will agree to pretend that Daryl Morey never tweeted anything about Hong Kong.
"Free expression is a complex issue. I think there's also a lot of misunderstanding in China, from our fans there, because they feel I'm being a hypocrite," Silver said. "They say, aren't you the same commissioner who stops people from talking about officiating? How's it possible that you aren't addressing this?...This is core political speech... We're looking to other U.S. corporations to see what that standard should be going forward."
If the experiences of Apple, Marriott, Mercedes, the Gap, American Airlines, Delta, United, the fashion industry, or the movie industry are any guide, that "standard" is total capitulation to the Chinese government. The NBA is clearly lurching that way. After a protesting fan was hamfistedly ejected from a Sixers preseason game, a large anti-China protest was allowed to proceed at a Nets home game on Friday night. But those protests could be few and far between this regular season. Tucked into a broad interview published Monday about cracking down on racist and abusive fans, NBA chief security director Jerome Pickett said the league was banning fans from expressing "anything that is non-basketball-related."
A league official clarified to the Daily News that fan behavior policy was modified back in August, before the Hong Kong controversy, and that "non-basketball-related" refers just to hate speech, not political speech.
But the extent to which political speech will be tolerated has yet to be tested, as protesting fans at a Wizard game had their signage confiscated. Money and fandom are welcome at an NBA arena, just not inconvenient opinions.
For its part, the Chinese government has slightly backed off its anti-NBA sentiment, according to a New York Times report. But just slightly. On Saturday, a state broadcaster excoriated Silver on CCTV, threatening "retribution."
"To please some American politicians, Silver has fabricated lies out of nothing and has sought to paint China as unforgiving," the CCTV commentator said.
Silver has "problems in his character... once someone's morality goes wrong, he will receive retribution sooner or later," the broadcaster said in response to the commissioner's claim that China wanted Morey fired.
In the face of that, Silver was still sunny. "Obviously, there needs to be mutual respect on both sides," he said Monday. "Respect for our system, and respect for their system if we're gonna play in their country. My belief is we will get back on track."
Silver also confirmed a report of an uncomfortable meeting with Lakers and Nets players in China. "It's true, it was a tense situation, the players were frustrated," he said Monday, before appearing to address criticism that players should have been brought home as soon as China took issue with Morey's tweet. "My point to the players was that we're partners. We have a huge investment in China, we've been at this for a long time, and how do you guys collectively feel about what we should do? The consensus in the room was, we're here to play games, we should play those games."

Warren poses existential threat to the economy

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – With three polls showing her in the lead, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., may soon eclipse former vice president Joe Biden as the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination. That's great news for Republicans, because Warren has a problem: The central message of her campaign is that the economy is working for the very wealthy but it is not working for ordinary Americans. Unfortunately for her, ordinary Americans disagree.
A Marist poll asked voters whether "the economy is working well for you personally." Nearly two-thirds of Americans said yes. This includes large majorities in almost every demographic group. Sixty-seven percent of college graduates and 64% of those without a college education say the economy is working for them. So do 68% of whites, and 61% of nonwhite people. So do Americans of every generation: 63% of Generation Z and millennials; 69% of Generation X; 63% of baby boomers; and 69% of Greatest Generation and Silent Generation voters. So do supermajorities in every region in the country: 60% in the West, 65% in the Northeast, 67% in the Midwest, and 68% in the South. So do most voters in every type of American community: 63% of both big and small city voters; 64% of small-town voters; 66% of rural voters; and 72% of suburban voters. Most everyone, it seems, says the economy is working for them.
The only groups who disagree, Marist found, are progressives (59%), Democratic women (55%) and those who are liberal or very liberal (55%). So, when Warren declares that President Trump is "part of a corrupt, rigged system that has helped the wealthy and the well-connected and kicked dirt in the faces of everyone else," it resonates with almost no one except those on the political left.
There is a good reason for that. Unemployment is near a record low, and the United States has about 1.6 million more job openings than unemployed people to fill them. Not only are jobs plentiful, but wages are rising. And the New York Times reported in May that "over the past year, low-wage workers have experienced the fastest pay increases." Americans don't just think they are doing better in the Trump economy, they are doing better. Little wonder Democrats barely mentioned the economy in Tuesday's debate.
This progress is bad news for Warren. Why on earth would Americans rally to her call for "big structural change" to the economy when they say the economy is working for them? Especially when they learn the structural changes Warren is proposing would cost tens of trillions of dollars and — whether she admits it or not — would require them to pay more in taxes?
Manhattan Institute budget expert Brian Riedl recently added up the price tag for Warren's proposals, and the numbers are staggering: $30 trillion to $40 trillion over 10 years for Medicare-for-all; $2 trillion for Social Security expansion; $3 trillion for climate change and environmental policies; $2 trillion free college and student loan forgiveness; and another $1 trillion for initiatives that include free child care and housing. "Total cost: $38 trillion to $48 trillion," Riedl says. And that's before calculating the cost of offering free government health care to illegal immigrants, which Warren supports. There's no way to pay for that miasma of spending with Warren's wealth tax; it will require massive middle-class tax increases.
No wonder the so-called moderates were going after Warren so hard at Tuesday's debate; they know it would be a disaster if she were to capture the Democratic nomination. To win in 2020, Democrats need to win over voters who like Trump's policies but don't like Trump. They can't do that by telling these voters they are wrong about the economy working for them, and that they need to make peace with socialism. Instead, they need to convince voters that they can dump Trump and still keep their prosperity.
If Democrats nominate Warren, they will give voters suffering from Trump exhaustion no safe harbor. Her nomination would turn the election into an existential threat to the American economy. And since Warren said Tuesday that, if she is elected, and Democrats take back the Senate, they will "repeal the filibuster," she will be able to pass her radical agenda by simple majority vote. That means Trump's message — "whether you love me or hate me, you have got to vote for me" — will ring true for millions of Americans whose votes might otherwise be up for grabs.

Fisher's kingdom of finance rough around the edges; Hard-selling money manager is taking a hit over crude remarks.

Texto completo: The cold calls go out, hundreds a day, from a dank basement in the redwood hills south of San Francisco.
Inside the rambling, rustic-chic house, billionaire Kenneth Fisher has deployed a division of his mostly young, mostly male acolytes on a single, high-pressure mission: sell.
Worn carpets, musty smells, poor insulation: It's not what you might expect from a money-management empire that's been overseeing more than $100 billion. But then, this is the private kingdom of Ken Fisher, where Fisher's way is the only way.

For decades, the idiosyncratic money manager has sold himself as a brilliant stock picker with the help of almost a dozen books, torrents of direct mail, seminars, videos, ads, magazine columns and more. His happy message for investors: "We do better, when you do better."
Indeed, Fisher Investments has done very well -- most of all for Fisher. Over the last decade, as the firm filled mailboxes across America with tens of millions of marketing fliers, it has employed aggressive sales tactics to sell stock investments with relatively steep fees. Fisher, meanwhile, has grown fabulously rich: He's now worth about $3.8 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.
Few who've passed through his private-residence-turned-office in Woodside, Calif., or headquarters on a tree-lined campus in Camas, Wash., were surprised when Fisher let loose with a string of sexist and vulgar remarks at an industry conference this month. At Fisher Investments, such language isn't unusual.
At a staff meeting in 2008, for example, as financial markets were reeling, a woman asked Fisher if he'd considered shifting into defensive holdings.
"Why would I want half a dick?" Fisher replied, according to two people who attended the meeting.
Fisher, 68, initially said he was surprised by the recent uproar because he's spoken like that plenty of times. He later apologized.
But for Fisher the man, as well as Fisher the firm, the fallout is piling up. Already, more than $1.8 billion in assets have drained away since his remarks on Oct. 8: Pensions for Michigan and Iowa and for the city of Boston have fired the firm. Fidelity Investments is part of the growing exodus. Others have said they're reviewing their relationships.
Interviews with more than a dozen current and former employees paint a sobering picture of life inside Fisher Investments that began long before the recent blowup. Some described severe pressure to reel in and keep customers. Many spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid jeopardizing their careers or violating nondisclosure agreements.
Fisher, for its part, said it has nothing to hide and that it's proud of how employees strive to serve customers.
From Camas, an old mill town that's turned into a growing suburb along the mighty Columbia River, Fisher instills a hit-the-phones-or-hit-the-bricks ethos. The area (population: 23,800) is no one's idea of a financial center, but it has one advantage over his former California headquarters: no state income tax.
Fear is ever-present, some former employees said. They said they were held to vague targets and that it was easy to get in trouble for questioning the firm's methods or objectives. Some former employees said they or colleagues got dinged or "written up" by supervisors for what they saw as minor or surprise infractions, such as failing to respond to an email from a manager quickly enough.
Salespeople must stick to rigid schedules and make hundreds of calls a day, sifting through names of mostly unqualified or uninterested prospects. Many hires are recruited directly from college and are gone in a year or two.
"I thought Fisher was my dream job," said Nick Morrison, who joined the firm in nearby Vancouver, Wash., in 2011, when he was fresh out of the University of Idaho. He left the following year. "From the very first day, it was just a nightmare."
Morrison said he departed after having an anxiety attack in the parking lot.
In response to such comments, Fisher Investments pointed to internal surveys showing 79% of its employees think that the company is a great place to work.
"For the past week, current and former Fisher Investment employees have been inundated with requests to speak to the media," the firm said in a statement to Bloomberg. "Our message to them has been simple: Speak freely and candidly. The reason is also simple: We have nothing to hide. We are proud of our 3,500 employees, the hard work that they do on a daily basis, and the unparalleled level of service that they provide to our clients."
To be sure, a strong sales culture driven by metrics is hardly unusual in financial services. But Fisher's heavy use of direct mail, call centers and stock-picking stands out in an era when many registered investment advisors are emphasizing low-cost strategies such as funds tracking major indexes. The firm's advertisements say it tailors portfolios to individual clients. But former employees say that most clients end up with the same stock holdings.
"It definitely has a sales orientation that most [registered investment advisors] don't have," said Sheryl Garrett, founder of the Garrett Planning Network, a group that argues investors are better off paying advisors set fees, such as hourly rates. "Most RIAs don't know how to sell. Nor would they think of spending the millions a year that Fisher spends on marketing."
Founded in 1979, Fisher Investments manages more than $67 billion for private clients and more than $35 billion for institutions, according to data posted on its website before Fisher's remarks.
His father, the late Philip Fisher, wrote one of the first investment books to become a New York Times bestseller, "Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits," a 1958 guide that Warren Buffett has called a major influence on his career.
The reins are held tight. Investment decisions are made by Ken Fisher and four other men. While low-cost index-tracking funds have come into vogue in recent decades for their long record of beating actively managed stock funds, Fisher's pitch is that it can pick winners.
Publicly available information on Fisher's funds and strategies showed mixed performance. The Purisima Total Return Fund, for example, returned well under half of the S&P 500 Index in its final 10 years before it was liquidated in 2016, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
There are also vehicles that have done better. The Fisher Global Return strategy for private clients generated 10.7% and 7.6% annualized returns after fees on a three- and five-year basis, respectively -- about half a percentage point better than the MSCI World benchmark it uses, according to data provided by the company. The strategy has lagged that index most years in the prolonged bull market since the financial crisis in 2009.
One reason Fisher Investments has turned into such a bonanza for its founder is simple: fees. Depending on the account assets, fees range from 1% to 1.5% for private clients. In contrast, active U.S. stock funds typically cost about 0.7% of assets per year, according to a Morningstar report earlier this year. Index funds cost about 0.08%.
The investment counselors sometimes work from talking points, particularly when an anxious client calls about market volatility or alarming news -- including, it turns out, the recent stories about Ken Fisher.
Employees who manage relationships recently were instructed to tell customers that Fisher's remarks -- which included comparing the process of gaining a client's trust to "trying to get into a girl's pants" -- were taken out of context and blown out of proportion by the media, according to people familiar with the matter.
Counselors are also instructed to delve into customers' personal lives: Do you know any public figures? Journalists? Anyone in national or local politics or government? What about finance? How about lawyers? One template used by some investment counselors lists these among the "required questions" for clients.
Such questions can help avoid trouble in the event a client becomes unhappy with Fisher, some former employees said.

Texto completo: A Major League veteran, he was posted at second base when New York swept Minnesota two weeks ago. He died after having a blood clot following knee surgery.
Eric Cooper, a veteran Major League Baseball umpire who worked the American League Division Series between the Yankees and the Minnesota Twins just two weeks ago, has died in Iowa. He was 52.
Commissioner Rob Manfred said on Sunday that Cooper died after having a blood clot. He had had knee surgery earlier in the week and was recuperating at his father's home in Iowa. On Saturday he was talking to fellow umpires about his recovery.
Cooper made his debut in the majors in 1996 as a minor league fill-in and joined the big league umpiring staff in 1999. His most recent assignment was at second base for Game 3 of the A.L. division series at Target Field in Minneapolis on Oct. 7, when the Yankees completed their sweep of the Twins.
Cooper worked the 2014 World Series between the Kansas City Royals and San Francisco Giants. He drew that assignment in part because of his success rate on replay challenges; M.L.B. took those numbers into account in picking the crew, and Cooper had only three calls reversed all season.
He umpired in 10 division series, four League Championship Series and the 2005 All-Star Game, along with two World Baseball Classics. He was behind the plate for three no-hitters -- two by Mark Buehrle of the Chicago White Sox, in 2007 and 2009, the second one a perfect game, and another by Hideo Nomo, in 2001, when he was with the Boston Red Sox. Cooper also worked the plate in Cal Ripken Jr.'s celebrated final game, on Oct. 6, 2001.
Eric Richard Cooper was born in Iowa on Dec. 18, 1966, and played baseball throughout high school. He graduated from Iowa State University in 1989 after majoring in transportation logistics. He had been a board member of Mentor Iowa, an organization that helps abused and neglected children.
He and his wife, Tara, had two children, Chaz and Colt, according to a biographical sketch on the M.L.B. website. Complete information on his survivors was not available.

Texto completo: Several debate watch parties registered with Joe Biden’s campaign had paltry attendance in Philadelphia, where his 2020 presidential campaign is headquartered.
At one party blocks from Biden’s national campaign headquarters, just two people attended, including David Bradford, who hosted the gathering, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported.
Bradford, a registered Republican who is considering changing his party affiliation to vote for Biden in Pennsylvania's April 28 primary, and another man watched last week’s Democratic presidential debate in silence and left before the three-hour event concluded.
“He’s kind of the shoe we know,” Bradford said. “The comfortable shoe that fits. I see people going, ‘Oh he’s not the brand new shiny toy that others see and find appealing right away’ ... I think as we narrow the field ... that energy will pick up."
Two other watch parties within a 20-mile radius of downtown Philadelphia each had no more than seven people in attendance.
In comparison, watch parties for Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg have pulled in higher attendance and more enthusiastic supporters.
Marilyn Silberstein, a Biden supporter who hosted a watch party at her apartment in East Falls, Pennsylvania, said the former vice president doesn't draw as much enthusiasm as other candidates.
“No, he’s not exciting,” she said. “But haven’t we had enough excitement for the last three years? And you know what? That makes me more excited about him.”
Only three people, two of which supported candidates other than Biden, attended Silberstein’s party.
Biden’s campaign has struggled to pull in as much cash as his opponents in recent months and has a higher burn rate than rival campaigns.
"I hate to say it, but our opponents are way ahead of us when it comes to money in the bank," Elana Firsht, Biden's online fundraising director, said in an email appeal to supporters last week. "If we don’t pick up the pace here, we might have to make budget cuts that could seriously hurt our momentum in this primary."

CIA 'rattled' by DOJ inquiry into Russia investigation origins

Texto completo: The Justice Department's review of the origins of the Russia investigation created "unease" at the CIA, according to a reporter who has followed its progress.
Uncertainty over what investigators are seeking and whether the inquiry has become a criminal investigation has prompted some CIA analysts who played a role in the intelligence assessment of Russia's activities during the 2016 campaign to hire lawyers.
"It's really not clear where he's going with this, but a lot of people are very rattled. Those CIA analysts I mentioned had to hire their own lawyers because no one’s even sure whether this is a criminal investigation or not. And if it is a criminal investigation, what is the allegation of wrongdoing? No one I talked to can answer that," Ken Dilanian said on Monday's episode of Morning Joe on MSNBC.
Over the weekend, the NBC News reporter had a report published about the expansion of the DOJ review, which is being overseen by Attorney General William Barr and run by U.S. Attorney John Durham, who has requested to speak with CIA analysts.
A similar report was published by the New York Times that notes President Trump granted Barr expansive powers for the inquiry, but Durham lacked subpoena power and could only request documents and interviews when he was tasked with the review earlier this year. The report also notes, however, that it is unclear whether the status of the review has changed.
"There’s a lot of unease at the CIA and disquiet about the notion of federal prosecutors going over and rooting in their files," Dilanian said. "Not because they think they did anything wrong, but because these are sources and methods — some of the most highly classified documents and secrets in our government. And they are kept to a small set of people for a reason. It’s a need-to-know situation. And they’re questioning what is the need for John Durham and his prosecutors to go over and talk to them about that in the absence of any allegation of wrongdoing?"

The CIA declined to comment due to the ongoing nature of the matter.
Barr and Durham have traveled around the world for the inquiry, and Durham's team has already asked witnesses about possible anti-Trump bias among former FBI officials. Democrats have dismissed the allegations of wrongdoing during the Trump-Russia investigation and are concerned the review may be an effort to discredit the work of special counsel Robert Mueller.
Durham has yet to speak with key figures from the Russia investigation, but former CIA Director John Brennan says the prosecutor wants to speak with him and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper.
In an interview with MSNBC earlier this month, Brennan said Barr's participation in the review "really makes me think that the hand of politics and of Trump are now being used to massage what this ongoing review, quasi-investigation is. So I am concerned."
Republicans believe the impending declassification of Russia investigation documents will show an email exchange between Brennan and former FBI Director James Comey discussing the use of British ex-spy Christopher Steele's unverified dossier in the U.S. intelligence community's assessment on Russian interference in the 2016 election. Former South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy, who claims to have seen the classified material, said this puts Brennan in jeopardy more than it does Comey.
Durham enlisted leaders in the U.S. intelligence community, including CIA Director Gina Haspel, to help with the review.

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
For nearly a decade, Brian Rea, an illustrator for The New York Times, has drawn the images that appear alongside the weekly Modern Love column -- now also a television show -- which is dedicated to stories across the spectrum of love.
Mr. Rea's illustrations, which feature quiet yet colorful line work, can feel like a thread stitching the essays together into a single seemingly cohesive narrative -- one linear story of love and loss being told through an all-knowing lens. Mr. Rea, who lives in Los Angeles with his family, discussed his process and how his illustrations fit into a larger narrative.
How do you create the illustrations for Modern Love?
Dan Jones, the editor of the column, sends me the essay about a week in advance. I'll give it an initial read on a Friday night or Saturday. I sit on it and let it percolate. I'll come back to it on Monday and give it a good hard read, and what I'm trying to do in that second read is look for visual cues and hammer down the tone of that piece. Sketching the final piece takes about a day.
You have such a strong and distinct look and voice when it comes to your illustrations. Do you ever feel as if the voice of your work is ever competing with the voice of an essay?
My work is pretty quiet, and that's intentional, because, especially for something like Modern Love, I always look at the illustrations as being visual love notes rather than being big posters shouting an idea at the reader. Restraint is the best tool you have in your toolbox, and if I can just keep removing things from a piece until I'm down to the core of that story, that's when I feel like I've done my job. If I can get empathy out of the reader, then I don't need to do anything else. I want them to fall into it emotionally and connect with what the writer said.
Do you illustrate by hand, or is most of what you do done digitally?
Everything I do starts with drawing and painting. I'm a bit of a dinosaur that way. I tend to do all of the drawings by hand. None of it's done digitally in terms of the beginning process. The finished work, though, is done digitally. I'll scan swatches of color, I'll scan the drawings, and it gives me a little bit of efficiency. Because if I were to just paint them by hand, it would take much longer to make those tweaks and those little fixes that need to be made.
What keeps you doing this job?
I think it's the thing I love to do more than anything else.
You have mentioned that you use recurring characters in your illustrations. Can you tell me more about these characters?
I see them in a big Modern Love universe. All of these characters, they're all connected in some way. Sometimes it's their hairstyle, sometimes it's the clothing. I've had friends' dogs recurring in the pieces. I've had my son in there once or twice. In my mind, the most amazing thing would be to take them all home and make one big animated series out of them.
Do your own trials, tribulations and triumphs in love, in any of its forms, ever inspire your illustrations?
They must, right? It'd be hard to separate them. The thing about Modern Love that's so special, and completely bizarre, is it's this weird unicorn in the newspaper. Everything is news, news, news, and then you get to Modern Love, and it's just totally something else. It's a real departure from that. I feel like doing the essays, and reading these essays for countless years, it's probably made me a better husband and a better father. It's a column that really holds a mirror, whether you read it or illustrate it.
You were previously an art director for the Opinion section at The Times. How did your approach differ?
For Op-Ed, if you're doing a piece about a political topic or economics, it requires a different metaphorical storytelling device and imaging.
When you're doing Modern Love and dealing with so many heavy stories and topics, often the solutions are based on trying to evoke or elicit an emotional response from the audience."
Have you ever considered submitting an essay to Modern Love?
I don't feel like there's a big need for me to share my story. My wife won't be happy to hear me say that (we have a good story), but there are so many good love stories to draw from.

Spokane Is Reading
"Circe" author Madeline Miller discusses her book as part of Spokane Is Reading

In Homer's epic "The Odyssey," the hero Odysseus and his men land on the island of Aeaea, where they encounter Circe, a powerful witch who is the daughter of the sun god Helios.
But her part in "The Odyssey" is a minor, supporting one, something that frustrated Madeline Miller. Miller, a teacher who specializes in the classics, Shakespeare and Latin, wanted to see more of this minor goddess who turned sailors into pigs and took Odysseus into her bed.
So she wrote "Circe," the New York Times bestseller released in April 2018 that brings a new perspective to the witch of Aeaea because she was so intrigued by this character.
"The fact that she is a witch is pretty unusual. In fact, she is often listed as the first witch in Western literature," said Miller, who comes to Spokane this week to discuss "Circe," the latest selection of the Spokane Is Reading program.
"That was interesting to me because witchcraft is something that you do as opposed to something that you are. She's born a goddess, but she makes herself into a witch. And partially she does that because she was born a very, very minor goddess, the type of goddess who would have no powers on her own."
For Miller, it went even a bit deeper. "I also was really frustrated at how little airtime she gets in 'The Odyssey,'" she said. "It's a very, very small cameo role, and I really wanted her to have more. Every time I would read 'The Odyssey,' I would think, 'Can't we just stay with Circe? Do we have to keep focusing on Odysseus here?'
"I think it was wanting to understand her and to strip away the flattening of Odysseus' narrative from her story and give her full space to grow."
In writing about Circe, Miller created what reviewer Claire Messud called in the Times a "hybrid entity, inserting strains of popular romance and specifically human emotion into the lives of the gods." It's not the first time, either. Her previous book, "Song of Achilles," told the story of the Greek hero through the lens of the young prince Patroclus.
Because the story Circe is mythology, Miller felt free to play around in the lore and craft a story that felt more real ... despite the gods, monsters and magic. She left some stories of the goddess witch out of the narrative if they didn't speak to her.
In her story, Circe bore one son by Odysseus. There are accounts of them having five sons, but a single child would be the most likely result because of the year they spent together.
"The world still has to make sense," she said. "It's trying to always choose the myth that's most interesting for the character, that gives her interesting stuff to do, and that is serving the story.
And Circe certainly had interesting stuff to do. The firstborn, and least beloved, child of the sun god Helios and the nymph Perse, she had an unhappy childhood. But she had an independent streak, showing kindness to Prometheus, who was being punished for giving fire to mortals.
She turned her mortal lover, Glaucus, into a god. When he rejected her for the nymph Scylla, she turned her into a sea monster who plagued sailing ships for generations, an action that earned her exile on Aeaea.
She attended her sister Pasiphae as she gave birth to the Minotaur. She befriended Daedelus and his son Icarus and cleansed her niece Medea and her lover Jason of the murder of Medea's brother during their flight from Colchis with the Golden Fleece.
Miller weaves together these tales into a compelling story that puts her heroine - her feminist heroine - at the center of it all. Casting Circe as a feminist did not feel like a modern affectation to Miller. Instead, she finds evidence for it in the source material.
"In 'The Odyssey,' she is so clearly this epitome of male anxiety about female power. Here she is the woman who has power over men, the power to turn them into beasts," Miller said.
"She has this wild power that is frightening and is threatening and that goes along pretty much any time we're talking about witches. We're talking about women who have more power than society wants them to have. ... Any time women are wielding power that is making the people around them nervous, we're sort of touching on feminism."
The reception to "Circe" has been overwhelmingly positive, and Miller is always thrilled to meet readers who aren't well versed in Greek mythology who are now ready to read more after diving into the worlds of Circe and Achilles.
"I always love that because I wrote the books partially because I wanted them to be a way in for people who maybe haven't read 'The Odyssey' ever or maybe read it a long time ago or the myths never spoke to them," Miller said.
"Yes, there definitely are goodies in the books if you know the myths, but the classics teacher in me wanted them to be welcoming to everyone. And I think that's really important because it honors the original intention. These were stories that came out of oral tradition. They were ones that people passed on and passed down."

And it's all getting worse.
President Trump's train wreck of a performance Wednesday, at a meeting with congressional leaders, represented a new low on a scale that seems to have no bottom.
"I pray for the president all the time ... I think now, we have to pray for his health," House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said later, because "this was a very serious meltdown on the part of the president."
Trump began by complaining about having to attend a meeting initiated by his own White House aides, according to published accounts.
The subject was Trump's sudden decision to move U.S. military personnel in Syria aside, allowing Turkish troops and affiliated militias to sweep across the border and attack the Kurds, who had been loyal U.S. allies.
Trump then tried to make the case that he did not actually condone the Turkish invasion. Attendees were given copies of a truly bizarre and alarming letter Trump had sent to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Oct. 9.
Just four short paragraphs long, the letter begins, "Let's work out a good deal!" It ends by telling Erdogan, "History will look upon you favorably if you get this done the right and humane way. It will look upon you forever as the devil if good things don't happen. Don't be a tough guy. Don't be a fool! I will call you later."
That is how the president of the United States communicated with a powerful foreign leader at a moment of crisis. We have all witnessed more sophisticated attempts at persuasion on kindergarten playgrounds. Erdogan reportedly threw the letter in the trash.
At the White House meeting, Trump went on to denigrate James Mattis, the decorated and highly esteemed Marine Corps general who served as Trump's defense secretary before resigning last year over Syria policy. Mattis is "the world's most overrated general," Trump announced, according to The New York Times. "You know why? He wasn't tough enough. I captured ISIS. Mattis said it would take two years. I captured them in one month."
Anyone in touch with reality knows that none of this is true. The territory held by ISIS — the Islamic State — was reclaimed by Kurdish fighters with the aid and guidance of U.S. troops and intelligence operatives.
Shortly before the meeting, the House voted 354-60 to condemn Trump's abandonment of the Kurds, with most Republicans joining their Democratic colleagues in expressing outrage.
Senators, pay attention.
You may prefer to let voters judge Trump in next year's election.
But you must realize, at this point, that we may not have that long.

Texto completo: Damon Lindelof's take on the comic book series airs on HBO. And Jessica Biel stars in a new sci-fi thriller based on a fiction podcast.
What's on TV
WATCHMEN 9 p.m. on HBO. When the 12-part comic book series "Watchmen" came out in 1986 and 1987, it upended the traditional idea of what a superhero could be. In looking back at that comic for The New York Times, Adam Sternbergh wrote that "Watchmen" "felt entirely new, given it meant considering heroes as fallible and complex humans, prone to the array of ugly and shameful emotions recognizable from the real world." Now, with superhero stories dominating the box office, this new series from the "Lost" and "The Leftovers" creator Damon Lindelof offers a new take on that comic, trading the original's Cold War themes for those of white supremacy. Regina King stars as Angela Abar, who works with the police as her masked alter ego, Sister Night, while Jeremy Irons and Jean Smart play older versions of original "Watchmen" characters Adrian Veidt and Laurie Juspeczyk.
LEAVENWORTH 9:30 p.m. on Starz. This new five-part true-crime series explores some of the same military themes the "Serial" podcast examined in its Bowe Bergdahl investigation. It follows the life of Clint Lorance, a former Army lieutenant who ordered his men to fire at three Afghans while in Afghanistan in 2012. Lorance is now serving a 19-year murder sentence at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas and trying to navigate the military justice system in an attempt to overturn his conviction. The series raises questions about Lorance's case, as well as the system at large in a way that echoes Netflix's "Making a Murderer."
ON BECOMING A GOD IN CENTRAL FLORIDA 10:30 p.m. on Showtime. In her covert attempt to tear down a multilevel marketing scheme from the inside, Krystal Scruggs (Kirsten Dunst) has been swallowed up in Founders American Merchandise (otherwise known as FAM), the same organization that left her nearly destitute. By the final episode, Scruggs has peeled back the layers of the group, uncovering the forces that keep its members in line and the major players at the top who profit the most. But with Krystal's new love interest, Cody, onto her ruse, it's not clear if his allegiance to the organization will hinder her attempt to expose it for what it is.
What's Streaming
LIMETOWN Stream on Facebook Watch. It seems that Facebook Watch has taken a page out of Amazon's book following the success of "Homecoming," the fictional podcast-turned-streaming series that starred Julia Roberts. The actress Jessica Biel brings her star power to this 10-episode series, which is an adaptation of a podcast created by Zack Akers and Skip Bronkie. Biel plays Lia Haddock, a radio producer who's looking into the disappearance of an entire 300-person town in Tennessee (including her uncle, played by Stanley Tucci), which appears to be tied to a neuroscience research facility. Her investigation takes a frightening turn after a self-identified "survivor" reaches out and promises to put Lia in touch with other survivors. Like "Homecoming," "Limetown" has an eerie science-fiction feel and a complex female lead tugging at the strings of a larger, looming conspiracy.

Fermented Food Raises Questions

Texto completo: If by "benefits" you mean being wildly popular and sometimes unpredictably alcoholic, then yes.
Kombucha is a fermented food, much like cultured yogurt, cheese, kefir, kimchi and sauerkraut. Traditionally a carbonated drink with live micro-organisms, kombucha is made by brewing together sugar, black or green tea, liquid from a previous batch and the Scoby, short for symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast (though its more popular nickname is "mother," since it reproduces during fermentation).
The "tea of immortality" has come a long way from its reported beginning in China more than 2,000 years ago. It has evolved into a $ 475 million industry in the United States, nearly quadrupling in the previous four years, according to Nielsen. "Booch," as it's known, flows at megastores, coffeehouses and workplaces; and in bars in a more boozy form, with enough alcohol to rival an I.P.A.
What is kombucha said to do?
The drinks are promoted as improving digestion and diabetes, strengthening the immune system, reducing blood pressure and being detoxifying. Proponents also contend kombucha helps rheumatism, gout, hemorrhoids, nervousness and liver function and fights cancer.
"I think there's a 'health halo' around kombucha," said Howard Telford, head of soft drinks research for Euromonitor International, a global market research provider. Advertised as "probiotic," the drink taps into interest in the microbiome, and how our diets can affect the microbial communities in our gut, and even our emotions. Eating foods rich in probiotics is thought by some to increase one's "good" bacteria and balance out the "bad."
Does kombucha do anything?
If only the tea leaves could say. Just one study looked at the health benefits in humans, according to a review of the available literature published in the journal Annals of Epidemiology. Notably, 24 adults with non-insulin dependent diabetes consumed kombucha for three months, and their mean blood sugar levels reportedly stabilized to within normal ranges. But the study was not controlled or randomized, and the authors of the review noted that many of kombucha's claims -- like benefits involving rheumatism, gout, hemorrhoids and nervousness -- were based on anecdotal and unverified findings.
Cellular or animal research indicates the tea may have anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. Like dark chocolate and olive oil, the tea itself is high in polyphenols, or antioxidants. "The antioxidants that come from the tea on their own have a lot of health benefits," said Rahaf Al Bochi, spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.
But kombucha is unlike fermented milk products, such as yogurt, which have long been considered to have benefits for digestive and overall health. The bacteria in kombucha have not been confirmed to be probiotic. "We don't know if it does anything," said Franck Carbonero, a microbiome scientist at Washington State University-Spokane, in regards to health benefits. Some kombucha brands add probiotics to their tea.

Does kombucha have alcohol?
Yes, all kombucha drinks contain some ethanol. This varies from beverages with a small amount to those made with a kick: Sales of hard kombucha have spiked 247 percent in the last year, according to Nielsen. (Hard kombucha doesn't necessarily mean booze was added; producers intentionally ferment the tea longer to increase the alcohol content. Mr. Telford, who covers the industry, explained: "All of the retail hard kombucha brands I am aware of produce 'harder' kombucha via a longer fermentation period that utilizes more sugar.")
Most kombucha is marketed as nonalcoholic; that means it falls under the federal 0.5 percent alcohol by volume (A.B.V.) threshold. Anything more becomes regulated as an alcoholic beverage, like beer or wine. Because of fermentation or the way products are stored, the alcohol content can increase even after they hit the shelves.
"There have been many consumer complaints," said Bill Moses, co-founder of KeVita, a kombucha company PepsiCo Inc. acquired in 2016. "Consumers have unwittingly purchased what was represented as a 'nonalcoholic' kombucha that is low in sugar, but found when they consumed it they felt tipsy." Mr. Moses now heads Flying Embers, a producer of hard kombucha.
In the last two and a half years, six of the 21 kombucha samples the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets examined were above the 0.5 percent alcohol by volume threshold, according to the department. Three were above 1 percent A.B.V.; two of those hit 7 percent. (On average, the A.B.V. for beer is 4.5 percent.) Similarly, the United States Department of the Treasury's Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, which oversees the beverage alcohol industry, found nine out of 13 kombucha producers whose products it examined in 2015 to be noncompliant; and in 2010, that number was 20 out of 24. "Some of them didn't just drift," said Thomas Hogue, a tax and trade bureau spokesman, of past test results. "Some of them got really close to some of the beer ranges."

Can kombucha harm you?
"Commercial products should be safe," Dr. Walton Sumner, a research scholar with the Ronin Institute and a co-author of the review on the available literature.said. "But you probably don't want to use it for all your hydration." He also advises to drink it in moderation.
There are some exclusions: those with kidney or lung disease, who are at risk for acidosis, a condition in which there is too much acid in the blood. In 1995, two Iowa women fell critically ill after drinking homemade kombucha, and one of them died. Also, the Scoby can cause an infection in those who are immunosuppressed.
The sugar content can also be high for those watching their intake. Be aware of the range: from five grams a serving (Better Booch's Rose Bliss) to 14 grams (Wonder Drink's Asian Pear & Ginger).
The shifting levels of alcohol in kombucha can pose a problem for pregnant women, children, and individuals with liver disease or pancreatitis or those in recovery.
"Given that alcohol is a substance with well documented harms, the label should feature a clear and prominent indication of alcohol content," Dr. Anna Lembke, medical director of addiction medicine at the Stanford University School of Medicine, wrote in an email interview. She pointed out that for those in recovery, even small amounts of alcohol could trigger cravings for more and recommended that those who are sober refrain from the drink.
Is kombucha a scam?
Given the uncertainty over kombucha's therapeutic effects, Dr. David Ludwig, professor of nutrition and pediatrics at Harvard University, said tea drinkers should pause if it's not a flavor they like. "If you're drinking this for health benefits and not enjoying the taste," Dr. Ludwig said, "I'd say rethink your drink."
But for those interested in integrating a variety of microbes into their diet, Dr. Emeran Mayer, author of "The Mind-Gut Connection," recommends doing so naturally. "I personally drink it occasionally," he said. Instead of using pills or supplements, he said, alternate different fermented foods, including sauerkraut, kimchi, cultured milk products, and, yes, kombucha.

Media meltdowns and political polarization: Joel Kotkin

Texto completo: The mainstream media increasing appears much like the classic tale of the boy who cried wolf so often that when the wolf showed up no one believed him.
Similarly, since the bust of the Mueller report, and the evaporation of countless other “blockbuster” exposés, the media’s credibility in the ongoing impeachment saga is now widely doubted, even if this time they may actually be right about presidential misdeeds.
This divide can be seen in public perceptions of the news media. Although somewhat improved from its low point in 2016, only 40 percent of Americans, according to Gallup, trust the media, compared to over 50 percent in 1999. As befits the media’s increasingly partisan stance, the small improvement over 2016 comes almost entirely from Democrats. Only 15% of Republicans and barely a third of independents now trust media compared to nearly 70% of Democrats.
Once the news business had enough sense of propriety and professionalism to at least maintain an appearance of objectivity. There’s ample reason, as Glenn Reynolds suggests, to see many mainstream journalists as little more than “Democrats with bylines,” willing participants in what long-time leftist and fiercely anti-Trump reporter Matt Taibbi describes as the upper bureaucracy’s “permanent coup” against Trump. If this “coup” now actually succeeds, it will be one that will simply accentuate hostility to the media among a large segment of the population.
Media faces an economic crisis
No president has suffered such total opposition from powerful media. In his first year in office, stories about Trump were 62 percent negative, notes Pew, almost three the rate for Obama and more than twice that for George W. Bush, certainly no media favorite. His positive coverage was barely 5 percent, one eighth that enjoyed by President Obama. Some have thrived from naked partisanship, including an increasingly aggressive series of pro-Trump outlets. The New York Times, de facto leader of the anti-Trump media lynch mob, has seen its subscriptions burgeon, notably online.
But the Times enjoys a unique status with upper-class, educated readers. In contrast the mass audience seems to be turned off with the non-stop political haranguing. The almost comically anti-Trump CNN has seen its ratings drop so far that it now trails not only primetime leaders Fox, but has fallen to 15th behind ESPN, Hallmark Channel, History, TBS and others. Overall, all forms of media — television, radio, newspapers — have been suffered double-digit drops since 2016, according to Pew.
The timing couldn’t be worse, given the economic decline of traditional media stemming from the shift to online. Google alone made $4.7 billion last year from news publishers whose industry continues to shrink, losing an estimated 40 percent of its 2001 job base.
The collapse is most evident on the local level, including local television stations whose ratings have plummeted. Over 1,800 local papers have gone out of existence since 2004, notes a recent University of North Carolina study, and many more have stripped their staffing levels, creating numerous “news deserts” across the country.
The decline in local coverage, suggests the Nieman Lab at Harvard, has been filled by national partisan online media, giving ever more influence to media based in New York, Washington and San Francisco.
The new sociology of media
In the past independent, or at least quirky, voices could emerge from the hinterlands. When I was a young reporter, papers like the Kansas City Star, the Louisville Courier and the old Los Angeles Herald Examiner were well-staffed, great dailies that not only covered news, but often with a very different perspective than the large coastal media.
Even in places like New York and Washington, the editorial workforce has been transformed, in part because of high housing costs. The journalist of the 1980s was often a middle-class homeowner who could afford to live in the suburbs of New York and Washington. My neighbor at the Washington Post was a hard-drinking Italian working-class guy whose brother was a Baltimore cop.
Today that kind of working-class journalist has been replaced by younger reporters who often hail from elite universities. These young journalists, as Obama speechwriter Ben Rhodes noted, did not have to cover city councils and other boring local minutiae, leaping directly from graduate school into major newspapers and radio and television outlets. They may be good test-takers, but literally know nothing about the real world that people unlike themselves inhabit.
Overall, the new breed of reporters almost universally follow the progressive party line. In 2018, barely 7 percent of U.S. reporters identified themselves as Republicans; some 97 percent of journalists’ political donations go to Democrats.
But the new class order in journalism is not just a problem for conservatives. The gaping chasm between the elite journalists and working-class people, suggest left-leaning sociologists John Russo and Sheri Linkon, leads reporters to blame small-town residents and rural people for Trump without taking time to actually examine their voting behavior, life experience and attitudes.
Ahead: A troubled future
It was widely hoped the internet would forge an ever more diverse media. Yet, so far, we see a sad trend to homogeneity. This is likely to get worse as the tech oligarchs expand their control of media pipelines and continue to purchase major publications that were once proud exemplars of independent American journalism.
This takeover could become downright scary, particularly if there is a change of parties in Washington. There are growing calls, notably in The New York Times, to have Washington limit media that might appeal to the unhinged elements of the alt-right; progressives in some states, including New Jersey, have even called for the creation of state-supported media, not exactly something healthy for a democracy built on free speech and open discussion.
Many in media hope non-stop impeachment coverage, or continued unraveling of Trump’s inner circle, will both revive their fortunes and expel the hated Trump. The murky events in Ukraine also could undermine the credibility of the fledgling pro-Trump media, which could lead to even greater media homogeneity.
The emerging impeachment saga is likely to accelerate not only the alienation of much of the population from the press, but also create challenges for our democracy. With the demise of press diversity and openness, readers will be increasingly faced with a media that barely hides its prejudices, but instead offers largely alternative realities that may be only occasionally real and rarely edifying.

Texto completo: Major League Baseball says it's considering eliminating up to 42 minor league teams, but it's not clear if the proposal is being used as leverage in labor negotiations -- and there are no signs the changes would impact New Jersey's two teams with MLB affiliations, according to reports.
The Lakewood BlueClaws, a Philadelphia Phillies' farm team, play in the Class A South Atlantic League. The Trenton Thunder, a New York Yankees' affiliate, play in the Class AA Eastern League. Both franchises in recent years drew national attention when hosting visits by Tim Tebow, who is in the New York Mets' farm system.
New Jersey is also home to several independent teams that would also not be affected.
The Professional Baseball Agreement (PBA) between Major League Baseball and minor league teams expires at the end of next season. MLB has proposed consolidating its minor league structure so that more three dozen cities with affiliated minor league teams would lose those teams, according to Baseball America.
But the most vulnerable teams are those in the Appalachian League, Northwest League and New York-Penn League, a report in the New York Times said.
The BlueClaws reported drawing 308,318 fans this year to FirstEnergy Park and 7,711,681 fans over their 19-year history in Lakewood.
Officials for the Lakewood and Trenton teams did not respond immediately for requests to comment.
MLB is looking to dramatically improve Minor League Baseball's stadium facilities as well as take control over how the minor leagues are organized as far as affiliations and the geography of leagues, Baseball America said. Those areas have been under the control of MiLB for the past 100-plus years and would lead to a dramatic restructuring of how MiLB is governed and operates.
MLB has offered a proposal that, if adopted, would reduce Minor League Baseball from 160 teams—not counting the complex league teams that are wholly MLB-owned—to 120 beginning in 2021.
The report by the Times said MLB is committed to change "because officials believe about one-fourth of the minor league teams are not operating at a high-enough standard for major league athletes."

Texto completo: Major League Baseball officials have proposed a restructuring of several lower leagues, which could sever some teams' ties with M.L.B. clubs.
Major League Baseball has proposed a radical restructuring of the lower level of the minor leagues that could eliminate or change the nature and affiliations of as many as 40 teams across the country.
One plan that has been discussed, according to two people familiar with the negotiations who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter, would convert some teams from the lower-level minor leagues -- short-season, rookie ball and lower Class A -- into a so-called Dream League of undrafted players looking to break into professional baseball.
Teams in that league would be co-owned and operated by M.L.B. and Minor League Baseball -- a departure from the current system, in which the vast majority of teams are independently owned and operated. Part of the proposal could include a plan to cut the amateur draft in half, to 20 rounds, which would reduce the player pool by about 600 and subsequently eliminate the need for roughly 20 teams.
"We are in discussions with the owners of the Minor League teams to reorganize elements of the system with the goal of improving the working conditions of minor league players," M.L.B. said in a statement, "including upgrading the facilities to Major League standards, increasing player compensation, reducing travel time between affiliates for road games, improving transportation and hotel accommodations, increasing the number of off days, and providing better geographical affiliations between the M.L.B. Clubs and affiliates."
The proposal and others, including converting some teams into a college wooden-bat league similar to the Cape Cod League, met stiff resistance from the Minor League Baseball. Some fearful owners are already seeking legal advice for ways to deter M.L.B. from making any unilateral changes.
Pat O'Conner, the president and chief executive of Minor League Baseball, recently sent a letter to member teams, which was obtained by The New York Times, warning of significant impending changes and advising teams not to make any financial commitments, new lease agreements or schedules beyond 2020. He also sent a letter to M.L.B. outlining his opposition.
"We have told them that we don't see the Dream League as a viable alternative," O'Conner said.
The minor league teams have been told in briefings that M.L.B. is serious about forcing the them to contribute more money or choose one of the plans M.L.B. is presenting, all of which were described as "bitters pills" to swallow.
The current operating agreement between the big league clubs and their 160 affiliated minor league teams expires Sept. 15, 2020. The last major shift in the relationship between the major and minor league clubs came during a contentious negotiation in 1990-91 when M.L.B. took over player contracts and player development, leaving the minor league teams in charge of facilities and player care.
But many major league clubs do not see the need for multiple levels of Class A teams, and O'Conner said the current proposed plan would eliminate roughly 1,400 players (some of whom are not drafted but signed internationally), or change their status to employees of the minor league teams.
The most vulnerable teams are those in the Appalachian League, Northwest League and New York-Penn League. Other short-season teams, like the Brooklyn Cyclones, the Mets' short-season team in the New York-Penn League, could be converted to full-season teams, perhaps even in higher levels like Class AA.
For some minor league owners, the proposal could mean losing their affiliation with M.L.B. clubs, which gives them cachet and adds value to their investment. O'Conner estimated that only eight to 10 of the proposed 42 teams targeted for restructuring would have the financial wherewithal to sustain the new model. The rest, he said, would wither away.
"If they don't fold immediately, they would soon go out of business and we would lose baseball in those cities," he said.
But M.L.B. is committed to a significant change because officials feel that about one-fourth of the minor league teams are not operating at a high-enough standard for modern athletes. M.L.B. also is under pressure to increase player compensation -- the league has been sued over that issue -- and is looking for a way to increase player wages, perhaps by as much as 50 percent. That is still below a rate sought by the complainants in the lawsuit.
Some M.L.B. teams conclude that the odds of a player selected in the latter rounds of the draft making it to the majors are so slim that it is not worth paying for the development of players who will never help the parent club.
M.L.B is also insisting that some of the minor league clubs upgrade their facilities so that their top prospects are not working in substandard training rooms with poor nutrition programs. Many of minor league facilities do not match the standards of even small college stadiums.
O'Conner conceded that upgrades have been made and more are needed, but he said that some minor league owners do not have the resources to make capitol improvements and that municipalities are reluctant to contribute. M.L.B. has also proposed a revenue-sharing plan -- or a tax -- in which the more profitable minor league clubs would contribute to the teams in poorer financial health.
But most minor league owners prefer to keep the status quo, in which they provide the facilities and the parent clubs assign and pay for the players and the coaching staffs.
M.L.B. is worried about the long distances that many teams travel, often on buses, to play their games, and wants to reorganize the leagues in a way that makes more sense geographically. Some teams have affiliates thousands of miles away from the parent club, and other teams require bus rides many hours long to the nearest games.
O'Conner said that his organization was ready to work with M.L.B., but said the minor-league owners are afraid of another bitter fight similar to 1990.
"There's an array of emotion," O'Conner said. "They're concerned. They're angry. They're disappointed. We thought we had a partnership that is stronger than this."

Texto completo: LONDON - A trans-Atlantic investigation conducted by a Washington museum and a London-based archaeological group has accused a prominent Oxford University professor of stealing and selling fragments of ancient texts to Hobby Lobby, the arts-and-crafts chain.
The fragments come from the Oxyrhynchus Papyri, a prized collection of more than half a million pieces of papyrus and parchment dating from the third century B.C. to the seventh century A.D. discovered in Egypt by two archaeologists in the late 19th century. The collection is held at Oxford University and overseen by the Egypt Exploration Society of London.
Thirteen fragments from the collection were found in the Museum of the Bible, a Washington institution founded by Hobby Lobby's evangelical Christian owners, the Green family.
The Egypt Exploration Society began an investigation in June after a director of the Bible museum released a redacted copy of a 2013 contract between the professor, Dirk Obbink, and Hobby Lobby stores for the sale of six items, including four thought to be from the Oxyrhynchus collection.
The three-month investigation accused Obbink, a member of Oxford University's classics department, of taking a clutch of ancient fragments of the Bible without authorization and secretly selling them to Hobby Lobby in transactions from 2010 to 2013.
In a statement released Tuesday, the Egypt Exploration Society said that Obbink had sold 11 of the fragments that subsequently ended up at the Museum of the Bible.
Two other items at the Museum of the Bible that were found to be from the Oxyrhynchus collection were sold to Hobby Lobby by an antiquities dealer in Israel, a spokeswoman for the museum said Wednesday.
"The exact circumstances of how those items moved from Oxford to Israel are unknown to us," the spokeswoman, Heather Cirmo, said.
Although the Museum of the Bible maintains that the items were acquired by Hobby Lobby "in good faith," the institution said it was making arrangements to return the artifacts.
Obbink, an American, has a Ph.D. from Stanford University and was one of the recipients of a MacArthur Fellowship in 2001. He has not so far responded to the claims and did not immediately respond to an interview request Wednesday.

Heisler: Lakers vs. Clippers rivalry now has all eyes on Los Angeles

Texto completo: Los Angeles vs. Los Angeles, Part One … of many.
Yes, it’s finally on. Ever since the Clippers moved here in 1984, people have pushed the notion of an intracity rivalry, but between owner Donald Sterling’s farcical bumbling and the Lakers’ majesty, there never was one.
Now there is. You could argue there has been one for years with the Clippers going 23-5 against the Lakers the past seven seasons, but it’s not about winning games in the regular season. It’s about which team(s) can go deep into the playoffs, the only thing that counts here … and it could wind up being “both of them.”
In any case, I expect to write about 20 or so Lakers-Clippers updates.
I know, why so few?
Hey, the season is only 25 weeks long or I would do more.
It’s not just the local teams, fans and press girding for excitement.
Until recent years, New York was the capital of NBA writers, with access to league officials leading to scoops for media heavyweights, starting with the New York Post’s Pete Vecsey, who invented the breezy notion of NBA columns with his slashing, news-hound style.
Vecsey retired to be replaced by … no one. Instead of capitalizing on the opportunity, the Post’s struggling rival, the New York Daily News, laid off NBA columnist Mitch Lawrence, as well as star Knicks beat writer Frank Isola, who tripped adroitly into an on-air role at ESPN.
Now with the Knicks as squalid as the Sterling-era Clippers, East Coast media outlets are sending flights of NBA correspondents west.
The Ringer’s Bryan Curtis notes a line of newly minted, L.A.-based NBA writers. The New York Times and Washington Post each have one, as do NBA.com and Fox.com. The Athletic has six writers and podcasters based here. ESPN has a veritable bureau focused on the NBA with Rachel Nichols, Ramona Shelburne, Dave McMenamin, Baxter Holmes, Kevin Arnovitz and Ohm Youngmisuk.
Los Angeles, the Wall Street Journal’s Jason Gay told Curtis, has become “Hemingway’s Paris of NBA media dorks.”
As for wrinkles, the dorks will have plenty to keep themselves occupied.
The Lakers want to go back to being the Lakers of Old … which they haven’t been in this decade, missing the playoffs the past six seasons while averaging 55 losses.
Their immediate challenge is securing Anthony Davis, who refused to commit himself beyond this season upon arrival. (“I have one year here, so I’m going make the best of this year. And when that time comes around in the summer or, you know, whenever the season’s over – hopefully, around, you know, mid-June, after we just had a parade and I need a couple days to think – then we can talk about that.”)
At 26 to Kawhi Leonard’s 28 and Paul George’s 29, Davis was the prize of the summer – or would have been with any assurance of keeping him – representing a bridge to a future that would enable the Lakers to recruit more stars to join him, as LeBron James recruited A.D. to join him.
So, Lakers fans wouldn’t want to see anything go too wrong this season.
You know, the way things went despite the arrival of James last season.
The Clippers conquered respectability, averaging 52 wins over the past seven seasons. Their challenge is legitimacy in a market in which the Lakers long ago raised the standard to championship-or-bust.
Now the Clippers directory starts with owner Steve Ballmer, GM Lawrence Frank and consultant Jerry West, heading a staff of young officials whom other teams keep trying to steal.
Their Blake Griffin-Chris Paul-DeAndre Jordan trio that unraveled two seasons ago was a star-studded show, just not good enough to reach the Western Conference finals.
It remains to be seen how far the less glamorous, more efficient Kawhi-PG-Lou Williams-Montrezl Harrell nucleus gets, but they look like legitimate contenders (and NBA GMs appear to agree).
It also remains to be seen if the Clippers can peel off Lakers fans.
It never has happened, but there has never been an opportunity like this.
Harry Bluebond, a die-hard Lakers fan, notes he will have more interest in the Clippers with “so many pieces in place and with a great infrastructure from Ballmer to Frank to (Coach) Doc (Rivers) to Kahwi, George, Lou, Montrezl.”
On the other hand, Bluebond has seen Lakers owner Jeanie Buss “passing on Jerry West when I knew he wanted back in with the Lakers as a consultant,” to Magic Johnson quitting, to LeBron’s denouncing Daryl Morey’s use of freedom of speech regarding the Hong Kong protestors, noting, “It will take a little time to settle back with the Lakers.”
Now to see if this will again be their town. It’s a tale of one city, but whose?

Texto completo: Los Angeles vs. Los Angeles, Part One … of many.
Yes, it’s finally on. Ever since the Clippers moved here in 1984, people have pushed the notion of an intracity rivalry, but between owner Donald Sterling’s farcical bumbling and the Lakers’ majesty, there never was one.
Now there is. You could argue there has been one for years with the Clippers going 23-5 against the Lakers the past seven seasons, but it’s not about winning games in the regular season. It’s about which team(s) can go deep into the playoffs, the only thing that counts here … and it could wind up being “both of them.”
In any case, I expect to write about 20 or so Lakers-Clippers updates.
I know, why so few?
Hey, the season is only 25 weeks long or I would do more.
It’s not just the local teams, fans and press girding for excitement.
Until recent years, New York was the capital of NBA writers, with access to league officials leading to scoops for media heavyweights, starting with the New York Post’s Pete Vecsey, who invented the breezy notion of NBA columns with his slashing, news-hound style.
Vecsey retired to be replaced by … no one. Instead of capitalizing on the opportunity, the Post’s struggling rival, the New York Daily News, laid off NBA columnist Mitch Lawrence, as well as star Knicks beat writer Frank Isola, who tripped adroitly into an on-air role at ESPN.
Now with the Knicks as squalid as the Sterling-era Clippers, East Coast media outlets are sending flights of NBA correspondents west.
The Ringer’s Bryan Curtis notes a line of newly minted, L.A.-based NBA writers. The New York Times and Washington Post each have one, as do NBA.com and Fox.com. The Athletic has six writers and podcasters based here. ESPN has a veritable bureau focused on the NBA with Rachel Nichols, Ramona Shelburne, Dave McMenamin, Baxter Holmes, Kevin Arnovitz and Ohm Youngmisuk.
Los Angeles, the Wall Street Journal’s Jason Gay told Curtis, has become “Hemingway’s Paris of NBA media dorks.”
As for wrinkles, the dorks will have plenty to keep themselves occupied.
The Lakers want to go back to being the Lakers of Old … which they haven’t been in this decade, missing the playoffs the past six seasons while averaging 55 losses.
Their immediate challenge is securing Anthony Davis, who refused to commit himself beyond this season upon arrival. (“I have one year here, so I’m going make the best of this year. And when that time comes around in the summer or, you know, whenever the season’s over – hopefully, around, you know, mid-June, after we just had a parade and I need a couple days to think – then we can talk about that.”)
At 26 to Kawhi Leonard’s 28 and Paul George’s 29, Davis was the prize of the summer – or would have been with any assurance of keeping him – representing a bridge to a future that would enable the Lakers to recruit more stars to join him, as LeBron James recruited A.D. to join him.
So, Lakers fans wouldn’t want to see anything go too wrong this season.
You know, the way things went despite the arrival of James last season.
The Clippers conquered respectability, averaging 52 wins over the past seven seasons. Their challenge is legitimacy in a market in which the Lakers long ago raised the standard to championship-or-bust.
Now the Clippers directory starts with owner Steve Ballmer, GM Lawrence Frank and consultant Jerry West, heading a staff of young officials whom other teams keep trying to steal.
Their Blake Griffin-Chris Paul-DeAndre Jordan trio that unraveled two seasons ago was a star-studded show, just not good enough to reach the Western Conference finals.
It remains to be seen how far the less glamorous, more efficient Kawhi-PG-Lou Williams-Montrezl Harrell nucleus gets, but they look like legitimate contenders (and NBA GMs appear to agree).
It also remains to be seen if the Clippers can peel off Lakers fans.
It never has happened, but there has never been an opportunity like this.
Harry Bluebond, a die-hard Lakers fan, notes he will have more interest in the Clippers with “so many pieces in place and with a great infrastructure from Ballmer to Frank to (Coach) Doc (Rivers) to Kahwi, George, Lou, Montrezl.”
On the other hand, Bluebond has seen Lakers owner Jeanie Buss “passing on Jerry West when I knew he wanted back in with the Lakers as a consultant,” to Magic Johnson quitting, to LeBron’s denouncing Daryl Morey’s use of freedom of speech regarding the Hong Kong protestors, noting, “It will take a little time to settle back with the Lakers.”
Now to see if this will again be their town. It’s a tale of one city, but whose?

Texto completo: Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler
R-Battle Ground
Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler, R-Battle Ground, said remarks by Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney on Thursday “raised additional questions” about the president's decision to delay aid to Ukraine.
Speaking to reporters, Mulvaney said that President Donald Trump's decision to withhold $392 million in military aid from Ukraine over the summer was linked to Trump's insistence that the country's new president investigate whether it had aided Democrats in the 2016 election. The unsubstantiated theory had been debunked by U.S. intelligence officers.
“The look-back to what happened in 2016 certainly was part of the thing that (Trump) was worried about in corruption with that nation,” Mulvaney said, adding that the pressure on Ukraine was “absolutely appropriate.”
His remarks contradict Trump's repeated assertions there was no quid pro quo directly connecting the military aid to Trump's own political prospects.
In written remarks to The Columbian, Herrera Beutler said Congress' goal should be “to uncover the full truth.”
She repeated her previous assertion, that the House needed to vote to open a formal impeachment inquiry so that Republicans acquire impeachment power.
“Members of Congress aren't being given access to all of the facts. For instance, yesterday, I requested to view the written transcript of the testimony from the U.S. Special Envoy to Ukraine, Kurt Volker. I made the request to Chairman Schiff's House Intelligence Committee that took the testimony and was denied. That testimony was two weeks ago, contained no classified information but was taken and is being kept behind closed doors — denied to members of Congress and the public,” Herrera Beutler wrote.
“I'm a sitting U.S. representative with top-secret clearance. If impeachment came to the House floor, I would be given a vote — yet, I'm left to rely on media leaks and selective bits of information released by Speaker (Nancy) Pelosi and Chairman (Adam) Schiff about what happened. This is no way to conduct a process where truth is the goal.”
In a conversation with The Columbian's Editorial Board on Oct. 10, Herrera Beutler said the House should formally hold a vote to launch an impeachment inquiry, citing the need for Congresswide subpoena power to grant the investigation bipartisan legitimacy.
Asked on Thursday whether Herrera Beutler would vote “yes” to open such an impeachment inquiry into Trump, the congresswoman's spokeswoman, Angie Riesterer, said Herrera Beutler would “have to see what was put forward.”
A running list from The New York Times indicates that 228 House members support opening an impeachment inquiry. No Republicans are on that list.
Asked how Herrera Beutler would currently vote on whether to impeach Trump, Riesterer wrote:
“Democrats know they haven't laid the groundwork and even many of them would be uncomfortable taking such a vote at this point. So far we have call notes, media leaks and secret testimony that even most members of Congress can't access. There have been no public hearings, limited cross-examination, no ability for the other side to call their own witnesses, no real due process of any kind, and no articles of impeachment have even been introduced. Further, if any member tells you their vote today is a ‘yes,' we know that's coming from a purely partisan perspective — based on leaks, innuendo, speculation and deception — not based on facts, because we don't have them yet. Your question is about 100 steps premature. But, if House Democratic leadership lost their minds, abandoned all pretense of fairness and due process and scheduled an impeachment vote for today, I'm sure Jaime would vote against it, in large part because of the wildly unfair and dangerous precedents such a vote would set at this early step in the process.”

Facebook Reaches Deal With Wall Street Journal Publisher, Others for News Section; News organizations including News Corp will be paid a licensing fee to supply headlines in news tab

News Corp has reached a deal to let Facebook Inc. feature headlines from The Wall Street Journal and other Dow Jones media properties, as well as the New York Post, in the social-media giant's coming news section, the companies said.
Other publications that have agreed to participate include the Washington Post, BuzzFeed News and Business Insider, people familiar with the matter said. The New York Times has been in talks with Facebook, but a spokeswoman for the paper declined to comment on whether it had reached a deal.
The deal, for which News Corp will be paid a licensing fee, presented some obstacles due to the Journal's firm digital subscription business model, people familiar with the matter said. Now that the issue has been settled, the way is cleared for the product to launch by as early as the end of the month. The financial terms of the arrangement weren't disclosed.
The licensing fees Facebook is offering range from the hundreds of thousands of dollars per year for smaller publishers to a few million for bigger ones, and substantially higher than that for the very largest outlets, according to people familiar with the matter.
"People want to see high quality news on Facebook," said Mark Zuckerberg, the company's founder and chief executive. "I'm excited we'll have the opportunity to include award-winning journalism from The Wall Street Journal [and other U.S. News Corp properties] in our news tab."
Facebook has sought to include news from about 200 different publications, although it only is offering to pay about a quarter of the news organizations that will be involved, people familiar with the matter have said.
The News Corp arrangement would allow headlines from properties in its Dow Jones unit, including the Journal, Barron's, MarketWatch, Financial News and Mansion Global, as well as the New York Post, to appear in the Facebook news section, linking to the publications' sites. For nonsubscribers, links to Journal stories that are behind the site's paywall would trigger a prompt for the reader to sign up.
Certain headlines appearing in Facebook's news section will be curated by a team of editors, while others will be selected by the company's algorithm, people familiar with the matter said. The "Top News" section will feature about 10 headlines selected by human editors. Subsections such as sports or entertainment and a "suggested for you" section will be selected by algorithm. The feed won't include any advertising, the people said.
Earlier this year, the Journal reached a deal with Apple Inc. to take part in its subscription news bundle , Apple News +. In that arrangement, Apple is taking 50% of the subscription revenue, with the Journal and other media companies that have participated—primarily magazine publishers—receiving a portion of the rest based on the amount of stories read, the Journal reported.
Other large publications, like the New York Times and the Washington Post, opted not to participate in the Apple deal.
The move to pay for news comes as the big tech platforms have come under growing legal and regulatory scrutiny. Alphabet Inc.'s Google has resisted paying publishers but recently announced changes to how it ranks stories on its news page to better promote original content, another long-running complaint from publishers.
News Corp Executive Chairman Rupert Murdoch and BuzzFeed Chief Executive Jonah Peretti have both called on Facebook and Google to pay organizations that provide quality news.
"Facebook deserves credit for recognizing the principle of journalistic provenance," News Corp Chief Executive Robert Thomson said Friday. "Mark Zuckerberg seems personally and professionally committed to ensuring that high quality journalism has a viable, valued future. It is absolutely appropriate that premium journalism is recognized and rewarded."

Texto completo: Eight Men Out: The Black Sox and the 1919 World Series
By Eliot Asinof (1963)
1. The story of the Chicago "Black Sox," the baseball players who took money from gamblers to lose the 1919 World Series, has long assumed the contours of a morality play about coarse, greedy ballplayers. Eliot Asinof admirably brings to light the human tragedy behind the headlines. In "Eight Men Out," White Sox owner Charles Comiskey is portrayed as a cheap tyrant who paid his players far less than the going rate and made them play in filthy uniforms to cut the club's cleaning bills, preferring to spend money wining and dining sportswriters. Players had little recourse, however, thanks to the "reserve" clause in the standard contract that kept them bound to their clubs in perpetuity. Any player who quit his team wouldn't be able to find a job anywhere else in organized baseball. In spirited, jaunty prose, Asinof introduces a Runyonesque world of pool halls, hotels and taverns filled with vivid characters—none of them entirely on the level. Most memorable among them perhaps is Arnold Rothstein, mastermind of the World Series fix who, the author notes, "recognized the corruption in American society and made it his own."
Foul! The Connie Hawkins Story
By David Wolf (1972)
2. Connie Hawkins was a schoolyard legend in 1960s New York, possessed of remarkable style and showmanship and an almost superhuman leaping ability. "For the true fan," David Wolf writes, seeing Hawkins play basketball for the first time was "like discovering a lost Rembrandt in the attic." In his first year of college, Hawkins received a $200 loan from a former player named Jack Molinas, who was subsequently arrested for fixing games. After New York detectives interrogated Hawkins, the forward was thrown out of college, despite the lack of any evidence that he had done anything illegal, and blacklisted by the National Basketball Association. For eight years—the prime of his basketball life—he played with the Harlem Globetrotters and in the American Basketball Association. In the end he would sue the NBA and win a major settlement. "Foul!" is far from a hagiographic sports biography. It's a tough and knowing look at the racial politics and often dubious financial practices of big-time basketball.
League of Denial: The NFL, Concussions, and the Battle for Truth
By Mark Fainaru-Wada and Steve Fainaru (2013)
3. During his Hall of Fame career with the Pittsburgh Steelers, "Iron" Mike Webster was widely considered the strongest man in the National Football League. After retirement, Webster seemed another person—one beset by confusion and rage, who spiraled downward until his death from a heart attack at the age of 50. "League of Denial" views Webster's fate as a lesson in the peril of football-related concussions. The book documents the ways in which the NFL played down the facts about that peril and the reports of independent researchers—among them Bennet Omalu, a pathologist who found in Webster's brain a pathology he had never before encountered in football players. The discovery would come to be known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a devastating condition that causes dementia, depression and, sometimes, leads to suicide. A colleague of Dr. Omalu's suggested—only half in jest—that the condition be called dementia footballistica. Most troubling, the damage didn't seem to come mainly from the spectacularly violent hits of the sort the NFL had long glorified—it came from the routine collisions of attacker and defender that are the essence of the game, a fact entirely in keeping with the answer Webster gave when asked if he'd ever been in a car accident: "Oh, probably about 25,000 times or so."
Cycle of Lies: The Fall of Lance Armstrong
By Juliet Macur (2014)
4. A New York Times reporter who covered bicycle racing for years, Juliet Macur was the ideal writer to chart a rise and fall unparalleled in American sports history. Her portrait of Lance Armstrong is lucid and unsparing, with a novelistic complexity. An extraordinary athlete, Mr. Armstrong was willing to suffer for his triumphs to a degree almost beyond comprehension; he was also vain and greedy. He won seven consecutive Tour de France titles, in part thanks to the use of the banned drug erythropoietin, which Mr. Armstrong fervently denied. Having conquered metastatic testicular cancer early in his career, Ms. Macur writes, "he had risen from his deathbed to a secular sainthood." Eventually, the truth came out, and the empire quickly crumbled. Ms. Macur ends her book with a striking image of the discredited Mr. Armstrong, abandoned by his sponsors, packing up and moving out of his Texas mansion.
The Last Temptation of Rick Pitino
By Michael Sokolove (2018)
5. Louisville University, writes Michael Sokolove, "was an example of how to build an institution of higher learning out of an athletic program. Right up until the moment when it became the prototype of how the whole thing blows up." The college's head coach of basketball, Rick Pitino, a brash New Yorker, led the Louisville Cardinals to an NCAA championship in 2013, but was brought down by not just one, but two, tawdry sex scandals. The more significant scandal, though, as amply detailed by Mr. Sokolove, is the corporatization of college athletics, mostly through lucrative deals with television networks and sneaker companies. It's a system awash with money—for everyone but the players.

Questions swirl around corporate tax breaks in NJ

Texto completo: New Jersey continues to probe potential conflicts of interest in the state's corporate tax break programs, and whether or not businesses misrepresented information in order to win millions of dollars from two recently expired programs now being investigated by federal and state authorities.
Audits and reports found that the state agency doling out billions of dollars in tax breaks to companies didn't have the processes in place to adequately vet applications and spot red flags, and raise questions about information companies certified as true in their applications and whether lobbyists registered with the state when required.
The agency granting the lucrative tax breaks, the Economic Development Authority, relies on fees from the applications to help boost the government body's budget, which is self-funded and doesn't rely on state appropriations. The fees get larger if an application is approved, which creates an unhealthy incentive and potential conflict of interest, according to lawyers on a task force created by Gov. Phil Murphy.
"Part of that funding stream is the approval of applications that require diligence and require a gatekeeper," said task force special counsel Jim Walden at a hearing Thursday.
In 2017, the EDA brought in almost a third of its revenue from Grow NJ program fees, or $13.2 million. In previous years, the agency collected an average of 15% of its revenue from the program's fees.
If an application is approved, a company must pay 0.5% of the award up to $500,000, and again for when the tax break is actually issued. Companies then pay a service fee up to 2% of the tax credit up to $75,000. A company pays up to $5,000 to apply for a tax break.
Walden noted that the EDA underwriters he interviewed all said the fees did not cause them to approve an application, and they do not receive any bonuses for approvals.
The Philadelphia 76ers basketball team, which won a close to $80 million tax break to build a new practice facility in Camden, is the only company that included the fees it paid in its calculation that determined the size of its tax break.
"What happened is that the public paid for the EDA's fees," Walden said. "That money is money that the public was deprived of."
False statements Refrigeration distribution company Rainforest Distribution, which won a $2.4 million tax break in 2016, appeared to misrepresent information on its application to the Economic Development Authority, according to evidence presented Thursday at a hearing led by the task force.
The Queens-based company certified to the Economic Development Authority that it was considering moving to either Bayonne or Orangeburg, New York. In order to win a New Jersey tax break, a company has to prove it wouldn't move to New Jersey if it didn't have the tax break.
Emails between Rainforest Distribution employees and a consulting firm it hired, CBRE, suggest that Rainforest did not seriously plan on locating in Orangeburg.
Rainforest CEO Alexander Ridings, who was the CFO at the time the company submitted its application, admitted during Thursday's hearing the company had no serious intention of moving to Orangeburg. He said a commercial real estate firm the company hired, CBRE, asked for detailed information and reasons about why the New York site would also fit the company's needs.
Emails between CBRE and Rainforest employees show a CBRE employee named Susan Harte asking for a "lower cost option than NJ" and advised the company not to submit the draft lease Rainforest had from the Bayonne location. The company did not have a draft lease from Orangeburg. Harte asked Rainforest to submit a different document to the EDA "as it shows we are not so far along."
Ridings said he did not understand how this information would be used in Rainforest's application, and that it was the first time he was dealing with a commercial real estate firm and applying for a tax incentive. Special counsel Walden noted that Rainforest would have probably still been eligible for the tax break even if it just listed its previous location in Queens on its application.
"Effective October 16, 2019, Susan Harte, who previously served in our Location Incentives Group, is no longer employed by CBRE," CBRE said in a statement. "CBRE takes great pride in its reputation for upholding the highest ethical standards, which we demand from each of our 90,000 professionals around the globe."
Task force lawyers also read emails between Harte and EDA employees, and asked if the messages should be considered lobbying. Stephanie Olivo, the director of compliance with the state campaign finance agency, said yes. Harte does not appear to have registered with the agency.
"If special interests are not disclosed, there's the possibility the special interests are using illegal means to get their way," Walden said. Registering means "at least there's a breadcrumb trail."
The New York Times found that over five years, a dozen companies listed the same New York address at Blue Hill Plaza as the location they were considering moving to if they didn't win a New Jersey tax break.
The FBI and Philadelphia prosecutors are among a handful of entities investigating the two corporate tax break programs meant to boost job growth and development, Grow NJ and Economic Redevelopment & Growth (ERG), according to the Philadelphia Inquirer.
A Senate panel is also considering replacement programs for Grow NJ and ERG, which expired earlier this year. An ethics committee dismissed a complaint filed by advocacy group Working Families earlier this week that alleged the committee was stacked with members with connections to insurance executive and power broker, George Norcross.
Norcross is tied to companies that won $1.1 billion of the $1.6 billion worth of tax breaks awarded in Camden, according to a ProPublica and WNYC investigation. The news outlets also found that lawyers from Parker McCay had an outsized role in the crafting of the Economic Opportunity Act, which created the revamped tax break programs. Parker McCay is led by Norcross' brother, Philip Norcross, and also represents many of the companies that won tax breaks.

'City boy' Huntress helps six-man football grow in Texas

Texto completo: Granger Huntress stumbled into six-man football almost by accident. He has evolved into the leading six-man authority in Texas — the owner of the website sixmanfootball.com that provides weekly rankings and point spreads of six-man teams and games.
Huntress became the source the national media contacted when they wanted to examine the unique combination of small-town life and the six-man game in football-crazed Texas.
He has appeared on ABC-TV's Good Morning America and has been quoted in Sports Illustrated, the New York Times, USA Today, The Wall Street Journal, and in magazines from Texas Monthly to American Ways.
He was even called by the FBI in 2005, when a private school in the Houston area replaced its high school players with college-age players in a misguided attempt to win a game.
"I really thought some of my friends were pranking me on the FBI call," Huntress said. "It had to do with child endangerment charges. When I figured out it was for real, I told them everything I knew."
Closer to home in Texas, Huntress has been asked by coaches to address their teams before games, and he has been asked to speak at pep rallies. He has even had some irate fans contact him, wanting something done about the officiating at their sons' six-man games.
Huntress became the second inductee into the Texas 6-Man Coaches Association Hall of Fame who wasn't a former player or coach. The first was Dr. Stephen E. Epler, who invented six-man football in Nebraska in 1934. The coaches association rewrote its hall of fame bylaws in 2018 so it could induct Huntress.
Huntress, 54, has settled into a senior statesman role. He enjoys a unique perspective of appreciating the innocence and simplicity of small-town people and their version of football, but also understanding where six-man fits into the overall bigger picture of football in Texas.
He's a voice of mediation and reason between the passionate, cult-like six-man fan base that demands equality and the indifferent 11-man establishment that hardly notices the six-man game. He also understands how six-man fits into media coverage alongside 11-man football.
That's a lot of expertise for the six-man world to hand over to a self-proclaimed "city boy."
"I didn't grow up a six-man guy or even a country boy. I grew up in San Antonio and I live most of the year in Austin now," Huntress said. "I spent time on family ranches growing up, and when I was in college (at the University of Texas), I liked to go out to small towns like Runge and Thorndale and Bartlett on Friday nights.
"When I started going to six-man games in the 1990s, the people knew I wasn't from a six-man town. Somebody would always come up and talk to me. There was a friendliness and openness that's missing at other places. I was accepted by the six-man fans. I understand and appreciate their game."
Huntress grew up around newspapers and became a "numbers freak" in college, when he and a roommate first discussed ranking teams and even tried doing it in baseball. But Huntress was 29 before he started ranking six-man football teams in 1993. He never showed anyone his rankings until the 1993 state championship game.
He first made paper copies of his rankings in 1994 and handed them out at six-man games he attended. He added a newsletter to his rankings and sold copies for $1 at games he attended. Later, he used UPS to send copies to games he couldn't attend. He sent the copies to the cheer sponsors since cheerleaders often sold game programs at the gate. Huntress told the cheerleaders to sell his sheet for $1 each and keep the money.
Huntress had some subscribers by mail and others by fax to his newsletter and rankings. And then the internet came along, and sixmanfootball.com was born. In addition to rankings and point spreads, the website includes fans' message boards and history of the sport. The website claims to be "the bible of six-man football in Texas," and no one seems to argue that claim.
When Huntress first started his rankings in 1993, there were only 84 six-man teams in Texas. Now there are about 280 — half of them public schools and half private.

'Modern Love' Arrives Onscreen

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
The New York Times's Modern Love column is celebrating its 15th anniversary of weekly essays about relationships and revelations. That adds up to some 750 hearts poured out in about 1,500 words. Four years ago, the column expanded into the world of podcasts; each week, a notable actor reads one of the essays aloud. And this week, Modern Love premieres onscreen.
The new "Modern Love" series, whose first season's episodes are streaming on Amazon, is inspired by the essays and has a cast that includes Anne Hathaway, Tina Fey and Dev Patel. Looking back, Daniel Jones, the editor of Modern Love since its conception, is glad that the column wasn't named "Truly, Madly, Deeply" -- a choice at the time -- because then his title would have been the Truly, Madly, Deeply editor. (And, yes, the "Modern Love" name was inspired by the David Bowie song.)
Here, Mr. Jones and Miya Lee, who helps with all Modern Love projects, from reading submissions to editing Tiny Love Stories, talk about the show and the insights they've gained over the years steeped in people's stories. The conversation has been lightly edited and condensed.
Do you think love is so different in this modern age than in centuries past?
DANIEL JONES I don't think love itself is different. The true thing is that you have to be vulnerable to find love and to keep it going. The ways that we try to not be vulnerable change in the ways, these days, that we use technology. We'll do anything to avoid being vulnerable. But that's the one thing we have to be.
MIYA LEE Some of my favorite pieces' circumstances wouldn't be possible with today's technology. For example, we had one essay called "Let's Meet Again in Five Years." It was about a couple in college who decided to break up, because they were so young, but said, "If we're both single by whatever age, let's meet again at the New York Public Library on this particular day."
They both show up and it's a wonderful reunion -- but I think about the uncertainty of whether or not they would. It happened before cellphones. The stakes were higher.
What service has Modern Love provided for both readers and writers? And how has it changed over the past 15 years?
JONES It provides an intimacy, and a sense of connection and empathy. Having someone be so vulnerable on the page and also come to understand something about their relationship -- there just seems to be such a hunger for that kind of voice and that kind of storytelling, especially in a venue where there are potentially millions of readers.
Our relationships are the most important things in our lives, and I think that often gets lost in these times of political upheaval. These days, I think the column has more service and impact than ever. It just feels like a little escape.
How has being involved with this project affected your relationships?
LEE It makes you more empathetic to others, and you realize everyone has a story. Also, a lot of the submissions that I read are about death. It's a reminder about mortality and what's important while you're here, being kind to those you love and expressing that love.
JONES There's a kind of resilience in people when it comes to relationships and getting your heart broken. And you realize that that's what human happiness is: having a resilience and an excitement about being alive. This is your shot. This is all you've got.
By the same token, you see people who are not happy, who sort of close off and start to die inside. You can see the bitterness in how they're writing about their experience and the blame. You see the full range of how well people deal with heartbreak. What that range shows is how to live a good life. That's what I feel is really most useful.
Why is the human appetite for love stories so infinitely renewable?
JONES It seems like a puzzle that can never be mastered. You can never feel like: "Now I've learned enough; it's going to be smooth sailing from here on out." That's really frustrating to people, that you can't just reach a certain level of competence in relationships to shield yourself from desire that can't be met, pain that can't be avoided.
LEE There are a lot of essays about dating; it's ripe for humor. People love that lightness and to kind of get a first-person account and have someone tell you about their most embarrassing night or something. It's really addictive.
What are some of your favorite love stories?
JONES I'm embarrassed to say I just watched "Casablanca" for the first time, like two months ago. That's a great love story -- so tortured and really hokey in some ways, but it's a classic for a reason.

Texto completo: President Trump has claimed his interactions with Ukraine were not an exchange of aid for cooperation. His acting chief of staff may have undercut that -- only to backtrack.
Mick Mulvaney, President Trump's acting chief of staff, answered questions on Thursday about Mr. Trump's interactions with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine that are at the center of an impeachment inquiry. Mr. Mulvaney said the United States withheld nearly $ 400 million in military aid to pressure Ukraine to investigate what the president has long insisted was Kiev's assistance to Democrats during the 2016 election. Mr. Mulvaney's remarks, which he later said were misconstrued, undercut Mr. Trump's own insistence that there was no quid pro quo with Mr. Zelensky.
During a briefing at the White House
The following excerpts, prepared by CQ, are taken from a complete transcript of the live, televised news conference at the White House.
QUESTION: So the demand for an investigation into the Democrats was part of the reason that he ordered to withhold funding to Ukraine?
MULVANEY: The look back to what happened in 2016 certainly was part of the thing that he was worried about in corruption with that nation, and that is absolutely appropriate.
QUESTION: Withholding the funding?
MULVANEY: Yeah, which ultimately then flowed. By the way, there was a report that we were worried that the money wouldn't -- if we didn't pay out the money it would be illegal, okay? It would be unlawful.
____________
QUESTION: But to be clear, what you just described is a quid pro quo. It is, funding will not flow unless the investigation into the Democratic server happened as well.
MULVANEY: We do -- we do that all the time with foreign policy. We were holding up money at the same time for, what was it, the Northern Triangle countries. We were holding up aid at the Northern Triangle countries so that they -- so that they would change their policies on immigration.
____________
MULVANEY: And I have news for everybody. Get over it. There is going to be political influence in foreign policy.
____________
QUESTION: But -- wait. No, no. On the call, the president did ask about investigating the Bidens. Are you saying that the money that was held up, that that had nothing to do with the Bidens? And you're --
MULVANEY: Yeah. No, the money held up had absolutely nothing to do with Biden. There's no -- and that was the point I made to you.
QUESTION: -- And you're drawing the distinction? You're saying that it would be wrong to hold up money for the Bidens --
MULVANEY: -- There were three -- three factors. Again -- I was involved with the -- the process by which the money was held up temporarily, okay? Three issues for that: the corruption in the country, whether or not other countries were participating in the support of the Ukraine, and whether or not they were cooperating in an ongoing investigation with our Department of Justice. That's completely legitimate.
____________
QUESTION: You just said you were involved in the process in which -- you know, the money being held up temporarily. You named three issues for that --
MULVANEY: Yeah.
QUESTION: -- The corruption in the country, whether or not the country would look -- they were assisting with an ongoing investigation of corruption. How is that not an establishment of an exchange, of a quid pro quo? You just seem to continue to be establishing this --
MULVANEY: Those are the terms that you used. I mean, go look at what Gordon Sondland said today in his -- in his testimony. It was that -- I think in his opening statement he said something along the lines of they were trying to get the -- the deliverable. And the deliverable was a statement by the Ukraine about how they were going to deal with corruption, okay? Go read his testimony if you haven't already. And what he says is, and he's right, that's absolutely ordinary course of business. This is -- this is what you do when you have someone come to the White House, when you either arrange a visit for the president, you have a phone call with the president, a lot of times we use that as the opportunity to get them to make a statement of their policy or to announce something that they're going to do. It's one of the reasons we can't, you know, you can sort of announce that at -- he -- on the phone call or at the meeting. This is the ordinary course of foreign policy.
A statement released by the White House
From Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney
"Once again, the media has decided to misconstrue my comments to advance a biased and political witch hunt against President Trump. Let me be clear, there was absolutely no quid pro quo between Ukrainian military aid and any investigation into the 2016 election. The president never told me to withhold any money until the Ukrainians did anything related to the server.
"The only reasons we were holding the money was because of concern about lack of support from other nations and concerns over corruption. Multiple times during the more than 30-minute briefing where I took over 25 questions, I referred to President Trump's interest in rooting out corruption in Ukraine, and ensuring taxpayer dollars are spent responsibly and appropriately.
"There was never any connection between the funds and the Ukrainians doing anything with the server -- this was made explicitly obvious by the fact that the aid money was delivered without any action on the part of the Ukrainians regarding the server.
"There never was any condition on the flow of the aid related to the matter of the D.N.C. server."

BACK STORY; Beijing takes hot-and-cold approach to nationalism; Mindful of double-edged swords, China reins in fever-pitch ire at NBA

Texto completo: Thousands of Chinese social media users had been afire with nationalistic anger all week, berating the NBA for its soft-pedaled stance on a manager's tweet supporting protests in Hong Kong.
Chinese companies and state media piled on quickly in a united front of patriotic indignation, announcing a boycott and slashed partnerships with the NBA.
It felt as though the whole country was united, standing up to the foreigners who dared insult China's national sovereignty.

Then a Chinese nationalist took his anger to the streets. He made a red banner that read, "Hong Kong belongs to China forever," planning to unfurl it at the Lakers game in Shenzhen on Friday.
But before he even made it to the stadium, local police confiscated the banner, treated him roughly and brought him to a police station, according to his own account on Weibo, a state-censored social media platform similar to Twitter.
"What have I done wrong? Is this still China?" the user lamented in a post that has since been deleted. "Are you telling me Chinese people will be oppressed even for loving our country?"
Other videos posted on social media show police confiscating Chinese flags from people outside the Shenzhen stadium, preventing them from protest during the NBA game.
When The Times called Shenzhen police to confirm the incident, they said, "We're not familiar with this affair" and hung up.
Beijing's softening in its stance toward the NBA was so quick that even Chinese nationalists struggled to keep up, revealing a more complex relationship between Chinese authorities and "1.4 billion Chinese people's feelings" than at first glance. Nationalism runs strong and genuine in the Chinese mainstream, but it doesn't always cleave to a state-defined path.
When Houston Rockets manager Daryl Morey tweeted in support of Hong Kong protests last week, China was already in a fever of patriotic fervor. For months, state censors had replaced regular TV dramas with shows about China's former humiliation by imperial powers, courageous Communist Party-led revolution, and return to glory under party Chairman Xi Jinping.
Every neighborhood was festooned with Chinese flags in the lead-up to Oct. 1, the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic of China, marked with an extravagant military parade.
In one of Beijing's old hutongs, or alleyways, a college student, Yu Jia, 22, explained patriotism as a sense of pride in social and economic progress.
"My great-grandmother always tells me what a great era we young women are experiencing: We can get education, marry whomever we choose, find a job we like," Yu said. "When she was young, everything taken for granted now was a luxury.... Things have gotten so much better."
Others said they were driven to defend national sovereignty, a principle as central and inviolable in Chinese society as the idea of freedom in the United States. Its importance has only become stronger under Xi, whose signature "China Dream" is one of a rejuvenated China that commands authority in the world.
Hong Kong's protests are about autonomy and government accountability, not independence, but Chinese state media and officials have framed the protests as a separatist movement orchestrated by foreign powers who want to fragment China to make it weak.
Such framing triggers Chinese sensitivities to the "bottom line" of national sovereignty and fear of foreigners trying to secretly carve China into pieces, an idea taught throughout the education system and reinforced by state media.
At Beijing's NBA flagship store, tourist Wang Anshu, 27, said he was a Kobe Bryant fan who'd watched NBA matches for nine years -- but now planned to boycott the league.
"They can't earn our money and not respect our national sovereignty," Wang said. "Only when we have a strong nation, then our voice will be heard and respected."
Another basketball fan, Li Shuang, 22, said he was boycotting the NBA too because he believed "Stand With Hong Kong," the slogan Morey tweeted, was a statement of Hong Kong independence.
"The Chinese government under Xi Jinping would rather be feared than loved. They would rather silence international criticism on this topic than try to win over hearts and minds," said Jessica Chen Weiss, a political scientist and associate professor of government at Cornell University.
But when a backlash arose in the United States, with lawmakers, gamers, basketball fans and "South Park" viewers all suddenly speaking up against China's ability to censor free speech even across the ocean, Beijing seemed to recalibrate its NBA stance.
There was no official announcement, but Chinese media reportedly received internal instructions to tone down their criticisms of the NBA, according to the New York Times and China Digital Times, a website that compiles leaked Chinese government documents.
Hu Xijin, editor of the usually virulently nationalistic outlet Global Times, posted a surprising call for restraint on Weibo. "There's no need for cutting cooperation with the NBA to become some sort of trend," Hu wrote. "As America becomes more closed, China needs to keep a more open mind-set."
By Monday, Chinese media giant Tencent had resumed live-streaming NBA games. Nationalists voiced their disappointment online.
"We have already surrendered?" wrote one Weibo user with the screen name Hsiung Fan.
"I feel like an idiot to believe everything was real," wrote another user named Yuchen Bao_Bao.
One explanation for the apparent change is that some branches of government -- such as the ministries of commerce and foreign affairs, which were in trade talks with the U.S. last week -- may have complained that overheated attacks on the NBA were hampering their work.
"This kind of highly nationalistic emotions are promoted by certain Communist Party and government branches rather than the government as a whole," said Fang Kecheng, professor of communication and journalism at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. He pointed to state media, which serve as the propaganda department, as an example.
"By publishing those articles criticizing Apple, the NBA, they can draw a lot of page views and shares and likes and followers," he said. "They can report to their boss saying, we have been doing great and we have significant influence online, especially among young people."
Whether that influence is real is hard to gauge. Cyber nationalism tends to be exaggerated on the Chinese internet, Fang said, partly because it matches state-supported narratives and also because that's how social media work everywhere: They amplify radical content and do not accurately represent public opinion.
"The nature of social media is that content charged with emotions are more likely to be shared," Fang said. "In the specific context of China, the emotion that is allowed by government authorities is basically nationalistic."
The danger of state-fostered nationalism is that it can spark grass-roots organization and spill into the streets. That's happened in cases including anti-American protests after U.S. bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade in 1999 and anti-Japanese protests in 2005 in response to new Japanese history textbooks whitewashing war crimes.
Those protests were permitted, but in other cases, China represses nationalist protests, especially over Taiwan -- in part because the most hawkish protesters demand action beyond what the Chinese government can deliver, like immediate war.
When it comes to that, Chinese authorities rein nationalism in.
"What they fear the most is that protesters will go on the street and form a movement," Fang said. "Nationalism has always been a double-edged sword."
It's a classic Chinese government tactic, Chen Weiss said: to whip up nationalism for domestic purposes, then reel it back when it begins to do more harm than good from the authorities' perspective.
But the tactic comes at a cost.
"Every time they spin up and wind down nationalism, it generates resentment at the government's hypocrisy and willingness to crack down on patriotism," Chen Weiss said.
Many nationalists defend the country against rights activists, dissidents and protesters who criticize China's authoritarian system of governance -- until they are shut up by the system themselves.
By Saturday night, the Weibo user who tried to protest had deleted his posts and replaced them with a new message.
"I truly feel that there is a possibility of disrupting public order by holding up banners in a public place. I hope all comrades and friends will be rational patriots. Let's build a civilized, wealthy and strong China together," he wrote, ending his post with the emoji of a Chinese flag.

Putin Has Got Nothing on Kim And His Horse

Texto completo: North Korea's state news agency said the dictator's eyes were "full of noble glitters" during his Putin-esque photo shoot.
It was a striking scene, of the leader of a nuclear-armed nation astride his majestic horse.
The North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-un, rode the white steed through snowy fields, galloping between dusted trees, pausing for an aw-shucks-I'm-on-a-horse smile at the camera. His servants in the state media said on Wednesday that his eyes "were full of noble glitters."
While Mr. Kim has no shortage of obviously posed propaganda photos, "world leaders on horseback" has been a very special genre at least since Vladimir Putin's famous bare-chested entry in 2009. This doesn't come along every day.
It is unclear whether the photos of Mr. Kim portended news of geopolitical impact. Unless, that is, you trust the North Korean state media, which called Mr. Kim's horseback ride up Mount Baekdu "a great event of weighty importance in the history of the Korean revolution."
Mount Baekdu is considered a sacred mountain laden with symbolism, the mythical birthplace of the Koreans. A volcano that straddles the Chinese and North Korean border -- the Chinese call it Changbaishan -- it is a central setting for North Korean propaganda, a place where soldiers are sent on pilgrimages to swear loyalty to their leader. North Korea insists that Mr. Kim's father and predecessor, Kim Jong-il, was born in a log cabin there, despite proof that he was born elsewhere.
In the past, Mr. Kim has visited Mount Baekdu before making major decisions, giving rise to speculation that this latest trek could foretell a shift in policy toward the United States. An attempt to revive denuclearization talks between the two countries broke down this month.
"Having witnessed the great moments of his thinking atop Mount Paektu, all the officials accompanying him were convinced with overflowing emotion and joy that there will be a great operation to strike the world with wonder again and make a step forward in the Korean revolution," reported the North Korean state news agency, which spells Baekdu that way.
Anyway, here's Mr. Kim riding through a forest.
Though Mr. Kim chose not to go full Putin, keeping his torso covered with a parka in the cold, he is part of a somewhat exclusive club of current world leaders to have been photographed on a horse. (A much less majestic horseback photo of Mr. Kim from 2012 suggests that he has grown into the role.)
That club includes Justin Trudeau of Canada, which you maybe could have guessed. Yep, Boris Johnson, the British prime minister, saddled up. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey fell off a horse in 2003 but summoned the courage to hop back on one 14 years later. Other confirmed riders include Narendra Modi of India, Joko Widodo of Indonesia and Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico.
To our knowledge, President Trump has not been photographed on a horse, though he did get near one recently. Of the Democratic hopefuls for president, Bernie Sanders appeared on a horse in a 1987 video, and Tulsi Gabbard was photographed on one for a New York Times article in August.

Texto completo: Here's some wonderful news that is also terrible news, sickening yet also irresistibly intriguing: They've made the New York Times's weekly "Modern Love" column into a quasi-fictionalized TV series (streaming Friday on Amazon Prime), and it is so syrupy sweet that it should come with options for a dental plan. The only thing worse would be if the Times turned its smug wedding announcements into little mini-documentaries about elite mergers - and I probably shouldn't even type that, lest they get any more bright ideas.
"Modern Love" once more proves what Orson Welles said: "I hate television. I hate it as much as peanuts. But I can't stop eating peanuts."
Ol' Orson might be surprised how many viewers in 2019 are drawn to watching shows for the sole purpose of loathing them ("hate-watch" being a common verb), or that TV as we know it now serves up peanuts eight, 10, 12 bowls at a time. "Modern Love" is eight deadly episodes long. You won't notice its effects until it has already poisoned you, and if you watch all of them and find it in any way pleasing or relatable, then I'm afraid to say it's over between us. (It's not me; it's you. ) If, however, you watch the show as a means of bile deployment, then scooch over and let's not enjoy it together, two shriveled hearts cuddled as one.
For those who are blissfully unaware, "Modern Love" appears Sundays in the Times's Styles section, where it began 15 years ago this month, featuring hideous yet often compelling personal essays by different authors, freelancers and everyday schmoes, each of whom feel some need to tell the rest of us about a time when they discovered certain profundities in their various relationships - from chance encounters, to bitter breakups, to deathbed revelations.
Tidy to a fault, a "Modern Love" essay is for people who think they are too smart for platitudes or perhaps even too smart for rom-coms. A lot of these stories are often about a threesome, of sorts, involving the narrator, the object of their desire and that annoying third wheel in the relationship: the city of New York.
It is on this point that the TV version of "Modern Love" is most annoying, relying on the permanent delusion that New York makes people fall into a special kind of love, unattainable anyplace else (unless on a brief trip abroad). It's the neurotic, entitled sort of love we used to find in Woody Allen movies, before we dumped him, only the show's executive producer, John Carney (who also wrote and directed most of the episodes), has added an extra tang of disinfectant. Some New Yorkers still fall for this crap, that the city is merely the perfect backdrop to the story starring them. Watching "Modern Love" is about as much fun as listening to a New Yorker complain about not being able to find a good bagel or a decent slice. Like I said, it's a hate-watch.
As with the column, each episode features a different tale and different pair of co-stars. This first batch is drawn from "Modern Love's" least complex, easily smarmified examples, launching with Cristin Milioti as a single, young woman whose suitors never meet the approval of her overprotective doorman (Laurentiu Possa); it gets cutesy when she gets pregnant and decides to raise the baby on her own. In New York, you see, doormen exist to become supportive father figures.
The next episode stars Catherine Keener ("Modern Love" is full of actors you like, doing things you don't like) as a New York Times Magazine writer (I mean, c'mon ) who teaches a young tech guru (Dev Patel) about the fleeting nature of lost love and how to head off a lifetime of regrets.
What seems to be the series's nadir comes early: Anne Hathaway, giving her annoyingest all as a bipolar woman who, in her more manic moments, imagines life as one musical number after another. Some will say it's a thoughtful and brave performance. And some will not. But things actually get worse, when poor Tina Fey and John Slattery act out a dull tale of marital dissatisfaction (written and directed by "Catastrophe's" Sharon Horgan) that is solved by . . . playing tennis.
As you watch along (perhaps asking if Matthew Weiner didn't already kinda-sorta do a lot of this last year with his disappointing "Romanoffs" series), you begin to anticipate which of "Modern Love's" standard themes will get the treatment: Do they do the one about the couple (Sofia Boutella and John Gallagher Jr.) whose first date ends up in the emergency room? (Of course!) What about the one where the young woman (Julia Garner) craves the fatherly attention of her older male boss (Shea Whigham) without realizing she's leading him on? (Could a future "Modern Love" season be based entirely on performative essays reduced to daddy issues?) What about the drifter-hipster homeless woman (Olivia Cooke) who picks two fussy gay men (Andrew Scott and Brandon Kyle Goodman) to adopt her baby? (Yes, it's here, too.)
What about something really icky, like getting Jane Alexander to play a woman who finds and grieves true love at an advanced age? They're all here, so shallow that they threaten to turn into commercials for fabric softener.
Or, speaking of the blatantly commercial, perhaps you remember that series of Taster's Choice instant coffee ads from a few decades ago, where the elegant strangers meet cute and invite each other in for a cup? That's all "Modern Love" really is - only colder and more crystallized.

Texto completo: State Dept. official said Trump chief of staff played an active role
In late May, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney organized a meeting that stripped control of the country's relationship with Ukraine from those who had the most expertise at the National Security Council and the State Department.
Instead, Mulvaney put an unlikely trio in charge of managing the U.S.-Ukraine account amid worrisome signs of a new priority, congressional officials said Tuesday: pressuring the fledgling government in Kyiv to deliver material that would be politically valuable to President Trump.
The work of those "three amigos," as they came to call themselves - diplomats Gordon Sondland and Kurt Volker, plus Energy Secretary Rick Perry - has come to light in recent days through newly disclosed text messages and the testimony of government witnesses appearing as part of an impeachment inquiry in Congress.
But Mulvaney's connections to the administration's interactions with Ukraine are also beginning to surface. Mulvaney's role in enlisting Sondland and the others to take over relations with Ukraine was revealed Tuesday in testimony by George Kent, the State Department's Ukraine expert, according to Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.), who participated in the closed-door hearing before the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight committees.
Mulvaney declined requests for comment. Some of his defenders have said he knew very little about the details of the trio's efforts in Ukraine and was mainly orchestrating meetings for the president.
"I don't remember any substantive conversation with Mick. I don't remember him approving, disapproving, getting involved, having an interest," said Rudolph W. Giuliani, who, as Trump's personal attorney, also served as the president's emissary to Ukraine. "Mulvaney was not a big player in this. I dealt with Volker and Sondland."
But current and former officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters, said Mulvaney contributed substantially to the unfolding political crisis, through his connection to key events related to the attempt to pressure Kyiv and through his general approach to the chief-of-staff job, driven by a perceived reluctance to displease the president.
U.S. officials said that Mulvaney met frequently with Sondland and that details of their discussions were kept from then-national security adviser John Bolton and other officials who were raising internal concerns about a hidden Ukraine agenda.
Mulvaney also tolerated meetings between Trump and Giuliani at a time when Giuliani was brazenly declaring in interviews his intent to enlist Kyiv in efforts to substantiate conspiracy theories about the 2016 election and revive seemingly dormant probes that could prove damaging to Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.
Perhaps most significantly, Mulvaney - at the direction of the president - placed a hold on nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine in the weeks before Trump used a July 25 phone call to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to pursue Giuliani's agenda. The impeachment probe was triggered in August by a whistleblower complaint submitted by a CIA employee to the U.S. intelligence community's inspector general; the complaint focused in part on the July 25 call.
When some in the White House questioned the legality of blocking funds to Ukraine - funds approved by Congress to help fend off Russian attacks on its sovereignty - U.S. officials said Mulvaney told staffers that he had determined that the money could be turned on and off with no legal consequence.
During his call with Zelensky, Trump emphasized how much aid Ukraine received from the United States, noting that he did not believe the U.S. largesse had been reciprocated. He then asked for "a favor, though," pushing Zelensky to revive an investigation of an energy company, Burisma, that had paid Biden's son Hunter to serve on its board.
Trump also prodded Zelensky to dig into a conspiracy theory that it was Ukraine - not Russia - that had interfered in the 2016 presidential election and that hacked computer hardware from the Democratic National Committee had been smuggled to Ukraine to hide the evidence.
Sondland, Volker and Giuliani had laid the groundwork for that call over months of meetings with Ukrainian officials, texting one another about the need to secure a commitment to produce what Sondland described as Trump's "deliverable."
That largely off-the-books effort could not have proceeded, current and former administration officials said, without Mulvaney facilitating meetings, halting the flow of aid and circumventing the national security bureaucracy.
In a measure of the internal tension and suspicion, Fiona Hill, who served as Trump's top Russia adviser until leaving the administration in August, testified this week that Bolton urged her to alert White House lawyers to troubling developments related to Ukraine. She said Bolton had vowed that he would not be "part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up."
U.S. officials said the friction between Mulvaney and Bolton led to several ruptures, including one on the day of the July 25 phone call. The White House has launched a formal internal review of the call and the circumstances around it, according to a senior administration official. The move was first reported by the New York Times.
Bolton, already troubled by the administration's interactions with Ukraine, insisted that he alone handle the pre-call briefing with the president. But Sondland, who as U.S. ambassador to the European Union is based in Brussels, demanded that he also participate in the prep session.
Mulvaney backed Sondland, urging that he be allowed on the call, according to a White House official. When Bolton refused, Mulvaney appears to have again found a way to bypass the national security adviser. Bolton proceeded to brief the president solo, but then Sondland was patched through on a separate call.
In a July 26 interview on an English-language Ukrainian television program, Sondland said he "actually spoke with President Trump just a few minutes before he placed the call."
Since he was thrust into the role of chief of staff early this year, officials said, Mulvaney has been more acquiescent to Trump than his predecessor, John F. Kelly, who sought to impose greater discipline in the White House and restrict access to the president.
Sondland "was talking to Mulvaney all the time," said a former U.S. official familiar with their interactions. When confronted by Bolton or Hill, the official said, Sondland would rebuff them, saying he felt no obligation to coordinate with them, because he had direct lines to Trump and Mulvaney.
"Mulvaney has really abdicated the most important duty of any White House chief of staff, and that's to tell the president hard truths," said Chris Whipple, author of "The Gatekeepers," a book about previous White House chiefs of staff. "He really should have thrown his body in front of that phone call with Zelensky."
One of Mulvaney's top aides, Rob Blair, listened to the Trump-Zelensky call and briefed Mulvaney afterward, a White House official said. The official said that Mulvaney began inquiring more urgently about the call only weeks later, after the whistleblower report surfaced.
That complaint alleged that White House officials had taken the unusual step of moving a rough transcript of the Trump-Zelensky call into a highly classified database typically reserved for covert intelligence programs and operations.
Mulvaney asked John Eisenberg, the top lawyer for the National Security Council, about the decision to move the record of the phone call. Eisenberg replied that he had instructed NSC officials to restrict access to the rough transcript but did not specifically direct them to place it on the classified server - implying they had done so of their own volition, the official said.
A former South Carolina congressman who came to Washington as part of the 2010 tea party movement, Mulvaney was installed as acting chief of staff in January. His promotion followed the departure of an array of senior administration officials - including Defense Secretary Jim Mattis - who seemed more inclined to challenge Trump's decisions, especially on foreign policy.
"The fundamental issue . . . is that none of the president's top advisers agree with his view of foreign policy. None of them," said a former senior National Security Council official. "None of his principals share his views, because they are so idiosyncratic."
Mulvaney, by contrast, did not have strong opinions when it came to international affairs. He was more in sync with Trump, sharing the president's "America First" view that the U.S. government should be doing far less abroad and that other countries should be doing far more.
Unlike Kelly, who often seemed to chafe at Trump's impulsive decisions, officials said, Mulvaney's primary goal often seemed to be pleasing the president.

Texto completo: From appearing to confuse Buenos Aires with the Falkland Islands to mistaking a falafel for a loofah, former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly has had his share of factual fumbles through the years. Tuesday, the conservative commentator was shredded on social media for questioning the existence of a woman who turned out to be very real.
O'Reilly was sharing his thoughts about the Democratic debate in Ohio on his Twitter feed – calling it a "Trump bashing festival" and accusing former Vice President Joe Biden of sleeping – when he expressed doubts over former Rep. Beto O'Rourke's claim that he met a woman working four jobs to try to make ends meet.
"Beto says he met a woman working FOUR jobs. And raising a special needs child. I don’t believe him. Sorry," O'Reilly tweeted.

"This is her. Her name is Gina. Her daughter's name is Summer," O'Rourke shot back less than two hours later in a tweet that included a photo of himself with the family.
"The problem with our economy is she has to live in her car – while a disgraced TV host like you makes millions," O'Rourke tweeted, referring to O'Reilly's ouster from Fox News over allegations of sexual misconduct.
In October 2017, The New York Times reported that at least $45 million had been paid out to settle sexual harassment lawsuits against O'Reilly. One Fox News analyst settled her case for $32 million.

Texto completo: FRYEBURG — For the first time in over a decade, the Portland Symphony Orchestra is returning to the Mt. Washington Valley for one night only at 7 p.m. on Thursday, Oct. 24. In celebration of the Leura Hill Eastman Performing Arts Center’s 10th Anniversary, the ‘PSO’ will be performing a very special concert with Broadway and Metropolitan Opera soprano Alyson Cambridge. Founded in 1923, the PSO is widely regarded as one of the top symphony orchestras of its size in the country. Led by Music Director, Eckart Preu, the orchestra is comprised of 82 professional musicians from all across New England. The October 24th concert at the LHE/PAC provides a rare opportunity to see the PSO perform away from their residence at Merrill Auditorium in Portland, Maine.
American soprano Alyson Cambridge has performed at some of the world’s most recognized performance venues (Carnegie Hall, Los Angeles Opera, and London’s Royal Albert Hall, to name a few). She is currently starring in Rocktopia on Broadway and has sung multiple lead roles with the Metropolitan Opera. Hailed by critics as “radiant, vocally assured, and artistically imaginative” (Washington Post) and noted for her “powerful, clear voice” (New York Times), Alyson Cambridge has become “one of the most diverse and compelling vocal artists on the scene today.” The Oct. 24 concert will also feature guest conductor Erin Freeman.
Tickets are $40 for adults, $35 for seniors (65+), and $20 for students. Order online at www.fryeburgacademy.org/pac, or call the box office at 207-935-9232. The Oct. 24 concert is funded in part by the generosity of the Robert & Dorothy Goldberg Charitable Foundation. The LHE/PAC is located at 18 Bradley Street in Fryeburg, Maine on the Fryeburg Academy campus.

Profound relationship with dance

Texto completo: Lincoln Kirstein, who founded the School of American Ballet and the New York City Ballet company with legendary choreographer George Balanchine, once said, "The domain of the ballet dancer is not earth but air." And those who have risen to the heights of the exacting competency required by America's premier dance company would agree.
"In the last decade of my career, when I was dancing so much with Wendy Whelan, I often felt that our dancing must be the closest thing there was to flying. Our beings and our bodies merged, and we went soaring through the ballet on a cloud," said retired New York City Ballet principal Jock Soto, internationally recognized as one of the most influential dancers of our time.
Soto, who has retired and now resides in Eagle Nest with his husband, will speak about his life and career as a professional dancer at "Opus 3," the third annual fundraising gala for Ballet Taos Thursday (Oct. 17), 6 p.m., at the Taos Community Auditorium, 145 Paseo del Pueblo Norte. Joining him will be a host of dancers from Ballet Taos who will perform selections from their repertoire.
Meet and greet
"Patrons will enjoy a meet and greet with the young artists of Ballet Taos," said Megan Yackovich, founder and director of Ballet Taos. "We'll also have live music from the extraordinary Colorado Springs-based musicians Crystal and the Curious, appetizers created and prepared by Messrs. Soto and [Luis] Fuentes, and a delectable dessert from the award-winning Chokolá Bean to Bar. Expect some pop-up performances of poetry, theater and improvisational dance from local performing artists who collaborate with Ballet Taos."
At 7 p.m. guests will then be seated in the theater for the performance portion of the evening.
"Mr. Soto will open the program and share his profound story and relationship with dance," Yackovich continued. And it is indeed a compelling story. Born to a Navajo mother and Puerto Rican father, Soto grew up on the Navajo reservation and throughout the Southwest, and knew early on that dance was his destiny.
"I am dancing with my mother and I am only 3, but already I can feel the thrill and the power of surrendering to the sum of our partnership with each other and with everything in this moment in time. I am her son, she is my sun, I am a small moon in her happy orbit. Every time we dance it is like this -- we spin ourselves a brand-new universe," Soto recalled in his critically acclaimed memoir, "Every Step You Take," of being taught a Navajo hoop dance.
Soto went on to receive a full scholarship at the age of 13 to the School of American Ballet. His parents were unable to move to New York City, so he lived away from his family with a group of other students and trained 12 hours a day. "It was pretty crazy," he said, "being a kid and wrapping my head around all the people and tall buildings and then, of course, the school."
George Balanchine influence
He was one of the last dancers to be chosen personally by New York City Ballet's George Balanchine (1904-1983) to perform in its corps de ballet. "I was in a class with over 100 other students, and me and three others were called out by the ballet mistress," he recalled. "She said, 'Congratulations,' and walked away. When we realized what she meant, we went outside and screamed with joy."
Promoted to soloist and, ultimately, principal dancer, Soto enjoyed a decadeslong career of which The New York Times said, "Ballet is a man called Jock." A 2007 documentary by filmmaker Gwendolen Cates for PBS' "Independent Lens" prime-time series captured both his pending retirement and growing activism with regard to his Navajo and Puerto Rican roots. (Titled "Water Flowing Together," it is the name of his Navajo clan.)
The performances that will follow Soto's talk are a selection of classical and contemporary works, performed by Ballet Taos dancers from the current 2019-20 season.
"Uma Abad, Willow Bowman, Anna Hastings, Jamie Jensen, Daisy Kirschbaum, Azure Rice and Bodhi Sogden are the featured performers," said Yackovich, who is especially enthused to showcase the hard work and dedication that her students have demonstrated in preparing for this event. "We'll be presenting new work," she said, "and we'll tease a bit of this year's 'Nutcracker' performance," offering a peek at Act II's Divertissement from Tchaikovsky's tour de force.
"Professional dancer and guest artist Zac Bigbee will then debut his new contemporary work," she continued. Bigbee, a Taoseño, began his dance training here and continued on to study in Denmark, San Francisco, the Netherlands, Israel and Russia. He now performs with Zikr Dance Ensemble in Denver and Cocodaco in Chicago, but returns home several times a year to work with Ballet Taos as a guest artist, teacher and choreographer. He will also be dancing the role of the Nutcracker Prince this December.
Dance dedicated to Soto
The evening will conclude with a Ballet Taos student piece dedicated to Soto, celebrating the students' love and respect for him, each other, their community, and their art form, Yackovich noted.
Ballet Taos is a nonprofit arts organization serving Northern New Mexico communities under the sponsorship of the Taos Arts Council and supported by the New Mexico Community Development Loan Fund and the Taos Center for the Arts. The company is multifaceted -- a professional company, an academy and an outreach initiative, Project Relevé -- with each component designed to support, educate and inspire synergistically, according to Yackovich.
"Our academy provides quality dance education rooted in classical tradition that prepares students for higher education or professional careers in dance and the arts," Yackovich said. "And Project Relevé exists to ensure the future of dance in our community by instilling an appreciation for the arts through progressive initiatives in the public schools and classes open to all ages and abilities."
"The programs are intensive and focused," she continued. "But if our students truly want to pursue a dancing career, then we're obligated to provide them with the skills they need to navigate the professional world." Ballet Taos coaches their artists to be "technically precise, rhythmically sound, artful and spirited in movement."
Soto joins Yackovich, herself a classically trained ballerina, in providing inspiration to those young people who wish to pursue a career in dance. "If I can pass on my knowledge, my stories, and spur the energy to learn in the youth of our community, then that might be the biggest achievement of my career," Soto said.
Since this is a fundraiser, tickets are $50 and available at the door or online at tcataos.org .
Each admission includes two "Raise the Barre" raffle tickets with which you might win a two-night stay at The Blake Hotel at Taos Ski Valley, or dinners at Lambert's of Taos, The Love Apple and Donabe Asian Kitchen, with performance tickets included. Of course, you're free to buy additional raffle tickets. The winners will be selected at evening's end.

Texto completo: A PBS program showcases a novel technique used to film in the Amazon. And an award-winning documentary short hits Netflix.
What's on TV
NATURE: UNDERCOVER IN THE JUNGLE 8 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). If a puma falls in the Amazon and nobody is around to see, does the animal look embarrassed? It's a question that may be answered in this documentary, which was filmed with a fleet of remotely operated cameras left rolling in the Ecuador wilderness for a month. The film is a nature doc with a meta twist: It showcases both a wide range of species and the means by which the footage was captured. The creatures shown include sunbathing bats, yellow-headed vultures and tiny monkeys.
ADDAMS FAMILY VALUES (1993) 5:55 p.m. on Freeform. An animated adaptation of "The Addams Family" was a hit at the box office last weekend, giving a new generation the opportunity to be introduced to the creepy, kooky Addams clan. In the new version, the patriarch and matriarch, Gomez and Morticia, are voiced by Oscar Isaac and Charlize Theron, who had some big shoes to fill: "Animation spares them from having to match the ingenious physical comedy of Raul Julia and Anjelica Huston," Ben Kenigsberg noted in his review of the new movie for The New York Times. Julia and Huston's fleshly humor can be seen in "Addams Family Values," a live-action comedy that sees Gomez and Morticia welcoming a baby boy ("It's an Addams!"). The film is the second 1990s movie about the mysterious clan by the director Barry Sonnenfeld. "It could be that the making of this sequel was sheer drudgery for all concerned," Janet Maslin wrote in her review for The New York Times. "But it doesn't seem likely. There's simply too much glee on the screen, thanks to a cast and visual conception that were perfect in the first place, and a screenplay by Paul Rudnick that specializes in delightfully arch, subversive humor." THE ADDAMS FAMILY (1991), the first of Sonnenfeld's Addams movies, is airing on Freeform directly beforehand, at 3:50 p.m.
What's Streaming
GHOSTS OF SUGAR LAND (2019) Stream on Netflix. This documentary picked up a nonfiction short film award at this year's Sundance Film Festival. Shot in suburban Texas and directed by Bassam Tariq ("These Birds Walk"), the film is built around interviews with a group of men whose boyhood friend is suspected of joining ISIS -- a possibility they debate as they discuss growing up with him as well as their experiences growing up Muslim in post-9/11 America.
VIOLA VISIONS FESTIVAL Stream on Medici.tv. The New World Symphony in Miami Beach is hosting a five-day festival centered on the viola this week, with events set to be live-streamed through Saturday. Tonight, several big-name violists will be conducted by Michael Tilson Thomas, in a program that places Bach's sixth "Brandenburg" Concerto alongside contemporary pieces by Nils Bultmann, Garth Knox and Andrew Norman. Other highlights from the festival include a concert Thursday night at which Nico Muhly will conduct his own "Keep in Touch," with the violist Nadia Sirota.

Texto completo: Democratic Presidential Debate, Round Four -- Analysis
Democratic presidential candidates, from left, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg all gestured to speak during the presidential debate, hosted by CNN and the New York Times, at Otterbein University on Tuesday in Westerville, Ohio.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota spoke as former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro looked on. She was the first to mention President Trump's decision to abandon Kurdish fighters in northern Syria, where they had been critical in the fight against Islamic State.
Businessman Tom Steyer and California Sen. Kamala Harris listen as Sen. Cory Booker, of New Jersey, spoke. He vowed to create a White House office of reproductive freedom to fight efforts to undermine Roe v. Wade.
Entrepeneur Andrew Yang, with South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg looking on, turned a question about wealth taxation into a pitch for a value-added tax, a tax on consumption that he wants to use to fund his universal basic income plan.
The Democratic candidates overwhelmingly agree: pulling U.S. troops from northern Syria harmed U.S. allies and interests in the region.
Former Rep. Beto O'Rourke advocated for sweeping gun-control measures, including a mandatory buyback of assault-style weapons.
Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, with Mr. Steyer looking on, right, touted her military credentials and pointed out that candidates other than Ms. Warren, Messrs. Sanders and Biden—all of whom are in their 70s—should also be asked about age as an issue. She would be the youngest to be president, if elected.
All the Democrats on the stage supported the House's impeachment inquiry of President Trump.

Trump ‘condemns’ parody video, doesn’t address attacks on media

Texto completo: The White House on Monday condemned a video that aired at a conservative conference last week at President Trump’s Doral resort, but made no mention of other inflammatory attacks on the media and political rivals during the three-day gathering.
The video was shown to some who attended the pro-Trump American Priorities summit that ran Thursday through Saturday at Trump National Doral. Meant as a parody, the video portrays a likeness of Trump shooting, stabbing and assaulting political opponents and the news media in a church.
“The @POTUS @realDonaldTrump has not yet seen the video, he will see it shortly, but based upon everything he has heard, he strongly condemns this video,” read a tweet from Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham.
The video’s airing was first reported by the New York Times. Organizers of the conference said it was not part of their programming and they had no knowledge of it until questioned by the Times.
Reporters from the Palm Beach Post covered the conference but did not see the video shown.
An organizer of the American Priorities meeting, Alex Phillips, said in a statement that the video was “not approved, seen or sanctioned by the AMPFest19 organizers.” Phillips said it was “shocking” the Times did not report on “sanctioned events” at the conference, including a panel conversation condemning political violence.
“#AMPFest19 always has and always will condemn political violence,” said Phillips’ statement.
However, the statement made no mention of the bashing of the media and Trump’s rivals from the stage.
In fact, when introducing former White House press secretary Sarah Sanders on Saturday morning’s prayer breakfast, Phillips lauded her for defending Trump before “the crazy, liberal, fake news media.”
Other speakers, from Donald Trump Jr., to political operative Roger Stone to Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk, called out the media.
Trump Jr., for example, rebuked reporters for covering the allegation by “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett that he had been attacked by Trump supporters in Chicago. Police officials later determined Smollett fabricated the story, a twist that was also covered by the news media.
Gov. Ron DeSantis attended the event. But spokeswoman Helen Aguirre Ferré said he did not speak at the event.
“The Governor has not seen the video and does not condone violence of any kind,” she tweeted Monday.
The president did not appear at the conference. Trump did not comment on the video, or condemn it, on Twitter.
Early Monday afternoon, he was chiding media coverage again.
“Wow! Hunter Biden is being forced to leave a Chinese Company. Now watch the Fake News wrap their greasy and very protective arms around him. Only softball questions of him please!” the president wrote on Twitter.
Trump has used social media to disseminate images of violence to reporters. In August 2017, for example, he retweeted an image of a train running over a CNN network reporter. That missive was then deleted from his account.
On Monday, the president of the White House Correspondents’ Association, Jonathan Karl, issued a statement condemning the video shown at Trump Doral last week.
“All Americans should condemn this depiction of violence directed toward journalists and the president’s political opponents,” Karl said in a statement.
The statement added: “We have previously told the president his rhetoric could incite violence. Now we call on him and everybody associated with this conference to denounce this video and affirm that violence has no place in our society.”
Another American Priorities event organizer Tom Shadilay told the Post that First Amendment rights were a priority at the event.
“The American Priorities conference itself is all about the First Amendment, really trying to amplify the First Amendment and bring that back in a fun way, and tell people it’s OK and fun,” he said.
Still, speakers at Saturday’s prayer breakfast used aggressive language describing the upcoming election as a “battle” and “war” to retain Republican control of the presidency.
Shadilay said that rhetoric reflected only one part of the spectrum of viewpoints at the summit.
“We are in a time right now where division is very strong, and I think that it’s good to have those folks under this large umbrella,” he said. “Not just to offer that rhetoric, but to put them in an environment where we can hopefully come together with some solutions.”

Texto completo: The push by Los Angeles officials to get Governor Newsom to declare a State of Emergency over homelessness is like a warning light flashing.
It draws our attention to a massive problem that people closed their eyes to for too long. But like any flashing light, the “State of Emergency” idea only helps us see part of the problem but not the whole—and ultimately it would deepen the quagmire and probably result in bigger and worse emergencies later.
Where the idea points in the right direction is easy to see: proponents of the State of Emergency rightly say it would streamline red tape on construction, reduce and shorten building approval processes, and block the frivolous use of environmental review to delay housing construction. That’s needed.
But let’s face it, here’s what’s really happening: First California passes laws that generate the crisis, then we declare a state of emergency to bypass those laws. But as a State of Emergency exemption, it’s an ad-hoc fix. It doesn’t address the systemic problem with the laws it sidesteps, and in fact it politicizes the whole situation further by allowing sensible construction only if political support for a formal Emergency can be cultivated.
But it gets worse. Some of the people who favor a State of Emergency also favor a so-called “legal right to shelter” which would create a basis to sue governments if they don’t directly provide housing to the poorest citizens. This would permanently turn the homeless into wards of the state and enrich those who would litigate on their behalf.
The homeless are indeed “victims of the system,” but not the system that most people think of. They are not victims of a free market in housing, because California has built a regulatory system that killed a free market in housing at all but the top price levels. Middle-income Californians are squeezed by this, too, but the most vulnerable Californians are pushed out on to the streets. The bottom rungs of the housing market ladder—where economically marginal citizens could once afford a place to live—have effectively been removed by bad public policy.
Let me give examples from a study soon to be published by the Independent Institute.
Los Angeles currently bans any housing other than detached single-family homes on about 75 percent of its residential land. Whereas in 1960 Los Angeles was zoned for up to 10 million people, by 1990 the city “had downzoned to a capacity of about 3.9 million, a number that is only slightly higher today,” according to the New York Times.
Then there are so-called “prevailing wage” (read: union scale) laws. Prevailing-wage mandates increased average California construction costs for affordable housing projects by between 10 percent and 25 percent, according to a May 2017 report from the California Center for Jobs and the Economy. In areas such as Los Angeles, PLAs could hike market-rate housing prices by as much as 46 percent. Then there are the endless faux-environmental lawsuits against residential construction, which are invited and inadvertently enabled by the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). And the list of anti-housing obstacles goes on.
What the homeless really need is a residential construction market that operates by normal rules that induce entrepreneurs to build housing all the way up and down the price spectrum—not just at the top where they can afford to overcome the regulatory and NIMBY hurdles. Don’t give the homeless a “right to shelter” by government; instead, give property owners a “right to build residential housing” on land they own. No, this would not eliminate restrictions on residential building, but it would raise a much higher bar by which to justify them. A ballot initiative amending the California Constitution would be the way to achieve this potent reform.
Less dramatic reforms would make a difference, too.
Allow builders to give homeowners’ associations incentives to accept new construction, so as to counterbalance the disincentives that lead to NIMBYism. Stop suppressing housing through rent controls and so-called “affordable housing” mandates; these are the functional equivalent of taxes on housing development. What you tax you get less of. Another obvious change would be to put an end to the favoritism shown to unions through “prevailing wage” rules that swell construction costs. And why not abolish or at least vastly modify CEQA?
The people who care the most about the homeless are those who want to reintroduce a real housing market—and incentivize nongovernmental programs that treat people like people rather than like dependent clients.
How can we expect the homeless to rebuild their lives when government programs warehouse them like surplus merchandise, and when we kick the bottom rungs out of the housing market ladder so that even if they start getting themselves together, they can’t find a room or apartment they can afford to rent?

Biden: 'These debates are kind of crazy'

Texto completo: Presidential front-runner Joe Biden described the Democratic primary debates as "kind of crazy" while on stage for Tuesday night's debate.
"Why in God’s name should someone who is clipping coupons in the stock market, make — in fact, pay a lower tax rate than someone who, in fact, is, like I said — a school teacher and a firefighter? It's ridiculous, and they pay a lower tax," the former vice president began.
"Secondly, the idea that we, in fact, engage in this notion that there is $1 trillion, $640 billion in tax loopholes," he added. "You can’t justify, at minimum, $600 billion of that. We could eliminate it all. I could go into detail had I the time."
Biden: 'These debates are crazy'
Biden continued, "Secondly — I mean, thirdly, what we need to do is we need to go out and make it clear to the American people that we are going to — we are going to raise taxes on the wealthy. We're going to reduce tax burdens on those who are not. And this is one of the reasons why these debates are kind of crazy. Because everybody tries to squeeze everything into every answer that is given. The fact is, everybody is right about the fact that the fourth industrial revolution is costing jobs, it is."
In the beginning of the debate, Biden faced questions about his son's decision to work with Burisma, a Ukrainian oil company. President Trump requested that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky investigate Biden and his son, Hunter, for alleged corruption during a July 25 phone call that led the House to begin an impeachment inquiry last month.
On Friday, Biden groused about the expanded debate, with 12 candidates rather than the 10 the last time around. Speaking at a Los Angeles fundraiser: “The deal was, well, no more than 10 people on the stage for three hours. Well, now there’s 12. They’re supposed to, if more than 10, they’re supposed to divide it into two. At least if you had a debate with five other people you might actually get a chance to say something. But I’m going to try to be more declarative, but not argumentative."

New York Times columnist plays race card after Trump mocks Joe Biden

Texto completo: President Trump last week said at a campaign rally in Minneapolis that Joe Biden as vice president was only useful because he “understood how to kiss Barack Obama’s ass.”
Whether that’s true or not, I don’t know and I don’t care. Perhaps it's the key qualification for any vice president. But I also haven’t spent much time thinking about it.
Liberal New York Times columnist Charles Blow, on the other hand, immediately heard the stirring echoes of the Amistad.
“The insult,” wrote Blow, “invokes a fear and disdain that white racists have had throughout American history: The subjugation of the white man to the black one. Indeed, Jim Crow was born out of a fear of ‘Negro domination’ in which white Southerners were deadly (sic) afraid that they could be forced to live under black rule in the wake of the Civil War.”
So this is how it will work. Even when criticizing what will surely be a white nominee on the Democratic ticket — and probably the whitest nominee of all — Trump will be called racist by the ever-reaching writers at the New York Times and the rest of the national media.

Rudy Turns Out To Be Guy Breaking Windows

Texto completo: I can still vividly remember where I was on Sept. 16, 1992 - at my preinternet computer terminal in the New York Newsday newsroom - when news started filtering back from breathless colleagues rising up from the No. 6 subway, that something wild was happening in lower Manhattan.
It sounded crazy - an outside-City Hall rally of 10,000 or so off-duty city cops and their friends protesting New York’s first black mayor, David Dinkins, had turned into a beer-soaked riot, an unruly mob that carried signs like “Dump the washroom attendant” and startled my colleague, columnist Jimmy Breslin, by screaming at him about an “[N-word] mayor.” At the center of the disturbance was none other than Rudy Giuliani.
Three years earlier, Giuliani had come within a whisper of defeating Dinkins, running on a campaign to clean out Gotham’s temple of money changers and corrupt bosses. Yet now, Giuliani and his campaign were handing out voter registration cards to this mob for a planned 1993 rematch, and then, as reported in The New York Times: “At Murray Street, the crowd was less hostile but more inebriated. Beer cans and broken beer bottles littered the streets as Mr. Giuliani led the crowd in chants, using an obscenity to refer to Dinkins administration policies.”
The lesson that Giuliani revealed in that riot-mongering, racist rant was that he now understood the way to get ahead was not to punch up at the corrupt and contented wealthy but to punch down on the poor and the underprivileged. It was the opening act of a Greek tragedy, an epic that spanned three decades as one man’s hubris put thousands of young black men behind bars yet propelled him upward toward the melting rays of a corrupt White House and the Russian mob.
It’s easy to see news that the former two-term New York mayor and personal lawyer to President Trump is under criminal investigation for what it is - a bombshell development on the road to what seems the inevitable impeachment of the 45th president. As Giuliani’s efforts to meddle in the politics of Ukraine have come into focus, some pundits who recall it was just a dozen years ago when polls showed the New Yorker as a presidential front-runner are asking, “What the hell has happened to Rudy?’
Maybe those pundits should and ask, “What the hell has happened to America?” because the essence of Giuliani’s downfall - youthful ideals surrendering to the lazy divide-and-conquer politics of white supremacy and the clown show of modern-TV politics, throwing away any morals at the first sighting of corrupt billionaires waving foreign currency - is the saga of America’s decline, too.
In 1985, I moved back to the New York area after a three-year stint in Alabama and I couldn’t turn on my AM car radio without hearing the latest glowing report about the dynamic federal prosecutor in Manhattan who was taking on Wall Street, the Mafia, and the city’s corrupt cabal of Democratic bosses.
It was under Giuliani’s rule that the feds tried the daring tactic of trying New York’s mob bosses as a criminal conspiracy, and it worked. Incredibly, this happened at the same time that the most corrupt Democratic bosses imploded, with Giuliani playing a key role in sending Bronx boss Stanley Friedman up the river. Some of this was simply that what was good for Rudy’s ego-driven ambition was also good politics, and he often stole credit from his underlings. But at the end of the 1980s, the idea of Giuliani marching on City Hall and cleaning out the remaining rot seemed like a good idea, even to some liberals.
That’s not what happened. In 1989, racism and injustice in the era of divisions mirrored by Spike Lee’s hit movie from that year, “Do The Right Thing,” trumped the corruption issue and swept the decent-if-diffident Dinkins into the mayoralty. Giuliani, who’d lost with a fairly honorable campaign, wasn’t going to make that mistake again. He’s learned the path to power was the backlash of common man white power, not locking up white-collar criminals - and the white riot of 9/16/92 was the day he revealed his new pact with the devil.
Two words came to define the awfulness of Giuliani’s eight-plus years running America’s largest city: “broken windows.” This was a vague academic theory - a crackpot one - that the response to the unsightliness of America’s urban deindustrialization and inequity was not empathy but a police state that placed a priority on graffiti, turnstile jumpers, black pot smokers, and “squeegee men” who survived by aggressively washing the windows of Manhattan’s bridge-and-tunnel tourists. The irony that Giuliani had launched his comeback atop the broken beer bottles of drunk cops was never pointed out.
He now had no problem using the city’s poorest black people as political props. I’d reported that the GOP mayoral candidate worked with rogue, sleazy Democratic neighborhood bosses to pay homeless people to hang around polling places in the hopes of scaring some voters away. I guess that was his cynical “broken windows” theory of politics.
Crime in New York had already had started falling in the final years of Dinkins’ term and thanks to demographics, the economy and different kinds of smart policing it was also dropping across the 99% of America not governed by Giuliani. What that policy did give Giuliani and New York City was a surge in mass incarceration, a wave of innocent black people harassed on their own streets under the soft fascism of “ stop and frisk,” and some stunning cases of police brutality.
The quasi-occupation of New York’s black and brown neighborhoods brought huge approval from the city’s white working class. One person who obviously absorbed the political lessons of this new brand of white supremacy was a failing Manhattan real estate developer who became fast friends with such a simpatico mayor: Donald Trump.
Yet even though New York City boomed during the era of Bill Clinton’s presidency, Giuliani was not a popular mayor near the end. Then came the horror of 9/11, and even the mayor’s critics can acknowledge that his display of steely resolve was welcome. Many thought Time’s Person of the Year in 2001 could ride that renewed popularity to the White House, but when that time came six years later, he was already mired in the world he’d helped create, a world of amoral greed.
As a “consultant,” Giuliani worked for the billionaire autocrats running Qatar, the Canadian company advancing climate change by ramming its Keystone XL pipeline across the American Heartland, and helping Purdue Pharma to push its painkillers and cause the opioid crisis.
In worshiping at the altar of dirty dollars, Trump time became Giuliani time. Was it his love of the hot cable TV lights, his bottomless need for cash, or their shared lack of values that formed a close bond? Probably a perfect storm of all of the above.
In 1985 Rudy might have locked up Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, the Ukrainian natives turned Florida businessmen. The two men are, in essence, mob associates, reporting to U.S.-wanted scamster Dmytro Firtash, who is said to report to the world’s worst crime boss (and Vladimir Putin pal), Semion Mogilevich. But the mobsters are now Rudy’s clients/associates, and his logical allies to conspire to warp Ukrainian politics and corrupt the 2020 U.S. election.
Thursday, not long after lunching with Giuliani at Trump’s D.C. hotel, Parnas and Fruman were arrested at Dulles Airport with one-way tickets to Vienna - an event that moved Trump one step closer to impeachment. Giuliani himself was supposed to fly to Vienna the following day.
The airport drama will be a dramatic scene when we’ve finally recovered enough to start making “All the President’s Men”-style movies about our nightmare. Maybe they can call the movie “Broken Windows.” Rudy’s beloved cops were stopping and frisking the wrong guys. It was Giuliani who was out there shattering the panes of a safe, stable democracy for his rich clients and spray painting “Ukraine Was Here!” on the sides of our voting booths while he wrung every last crooked ruble out of his dirty squeegee. Now it’s way past time for a crime buster who lost his way to finally see what real justice looks like.

Texto completo: U.S. Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler, R-Battle Ground, has said the U.S. House of Representatives should hold a formal impeachment vote in order to grant bipartisan legitimacy to the investigation of President Donald Trump and grant House Republicans subpoena power.
In a conversation with the Columbian's editorial board on Wednesday, the congresswoman said she disagrees with the White House's current strategy to stonewall the House's investigation altogether.
She said she understands the president's unwillingness to participate in a process many perceive as partisan, however.
"I see the point, when one party is saying the other party doesn't get to be part of the investigation. You start to wonder if this is going to be a fair investigation," Herrera Beutler said.
Despite broad support among House Democrats to formally launch an impeachment inquiry, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has held off on holding a vote - likely to protect 31 House Democrats in vulnerable swing districts where Trump remains popular, Herrera Beutler said.
But Herrera Beutler said the vote is a necessary step. She pointed to the impeachment proceedings surrounding former President Bill Clinton, when the House granted subpoena power to Democrats and Republicans in opening a formal impeachment inquiry.
That's crucial for public perception of legitimacy, Herrera Beutler said. It's the difference between "partisan impeachment" and a "bipartisan investigation."
"That has to happen here," Herrera Beutler said. "Otherwise the president's going to have - in the minds of the American public - he's going to have the right to say, 'That's a total witch hunt.' If they (Democrats) really believe they can prove it, then why not let us subpoena people?"
Herrera Beutler did not specify how she would vote if a bill opening a formal impeachment inquiry came to the House floor.
A "yes" vote would mark a major departure from her party; no other Republican member of Congress has said they'd support an official impeachment inquiry, according to a running list from the New York Times.
Herrera Beutler also repeated her previous assertion that she's seen no proof of a "quid pro quo," or that the president withheld $400 million in aid in exchange for political favors during a phone call with the president of Ukraine.
Until that can be proved, Herrera Beutler said, she wouldn't support removing Trump from office.
"Do I think the president had an appropriate conversation? No. Do I think that was wise? No. But I don't think that's a high enough bar for impeachment," Herrera Beutler said.
"It's not about Donald Trump. It's not about me. It's not about who's in charge of the House. This is about our entire institution and how our democracy functions. And unless someone's going to be the adults and do it the right way, we're going to make it worse."

Texto completo: Bloomberg
Joker continues to attract fans — and concern from law enforcement. The Warner Bros. film about the DC Comics super villain outdrew a new Will Smith movie and a new animated family feature to lead the domestic box office for a second week.
The film, starring Joaquin Phoenix in the title role, took in $55 million over the weekend in North American theaters, researcher Comscore Inc. estimated Sunday. Analysts expected $43 million to $45 million. The Addams Family, from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and United Artists Releasing, placed second, while Gemini Man, featuring Smith in a life-or-death fight with his younger clone, landed in third place.
With a storyline that looks similar to some real-life mass shootings, Joker has sparked concerns about violence. The FBI said Friday it was monitoring online threats centered on showings of the movie. The studio, part of AT&T Inc., has said the film isn’t intended “to hold this character up as a hero.”
The Addams Family, based on the satirical Charles Addams cartoons from The New Yorker, opened with sales of $30.3 million, more than analysts’ forecasts of up to $29 million. It’s the third feature-length movie to come out of the cartoons, which also spawned a TV series in the 1960s and a 2009 musical.
Gemini Man, from Viacom Inc.’s film division, opened with sales of $20.5 million, compared with forecasts of $21 million to $22.8 million. The film from director Ang Lee features Smith as an assassin, and his younger clone, Junior. The movie had been in the works for years but the filmmakers had to wait for enabling technology to catch up, according to The New York Times.
One other new movie opened in wide release. Jexi, a comedy from Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. featuring Rose Byrne, opened with sales of $3.1 million. Box Office Mojo was predicting $3.5 million.

Texto completo: The Green Arrow prepares to hang up his bow in his series's final season, and John Cameron Mitchell struts his stuff in "Hedwig."
What's on TV
ARROW 9 p.m. on the CW. This superhero saga based on DC Comics' hooded vigilante archer, Green Arrow, debuted back in 2012, and has since spawned an entire shared universe of shows centered on other DC heroes like "The Flash" and "Batwoman." The ability to tell crossover stories is just one aspect of this series's success. To keep longtime fans happy, "the episodes are peppered with references from the comic books -- adversaries with names like Deathstroke and Count Vertigo -- but not so many as to confuse viewers who might not know the source material," Joe Rhodes wrote in The New York Times. But the time has come for Oliver Queen (Stephen Amell) to hang up his bow. As the show enters its eighth and final season, Queen has left his home of Star City to protect the multiverse from impending crisis.
THE PURGE 9 p.m. on USA. James DeMonaco's "Purge" films centered on the 12-hour period when all crime is legal in a near-future dystopian America, a national holiday celebrated as an extreme exercise in stress relief. But this anthology series, based on the films, explores what the Purge world looks like on the other 364 days of the year. In Season 2, the show examines how one Purge night affects the lives of four interconnected characters over the course of the year, and how those events influence how they prepare for the next one.
TREADSTONE 10 p.m. on USA. For those still lamenting the end of the Jason Bourne franchise, this new spinoff series delves deeper into the clandestine black-ops program that created that C.I.A. assassin. The show follows various sleeper agents, programmed to become superhuman killing machines (action sequences abound), as they awaken across the world and set off to complete their missions. But as they begin to discover their powers, they also start questioning their mysterious origins.
What's Streaming
HEDWIG AND THE ANGRY INCH (2001) Stream on HBO platforms. This Off Broadway success-turned-film follows the misadventures of Hedwig, the survivor of a botched sex-change operation who embarks on a no-budget rock tour across America, performing in buffets and seafood restaurants. Through her performances and flashbacks, we find out more about Hedwig's back story, and how her childhood in Communist East Germany led to her passion for American pop music. We also learn about her romantic and professional hangups with Tommy Gnosis, her former protégé and ex-boyfriend. Hedwig may be bitter, but she also has the vulnerability of a lonely person searching for what can make her whole. "One way of looking at this clever, funny, wildly innovative film tricked out with surreal pop embellishments and Day-Glo colors is to see it as the kind of movie David Bowie might have made had he pushed his early-70's gender-bending persona to its logical limit," Stephen Holden wrote in his New York Times review. The character, created and played by John Cameron Mitchell, reached Broadway in a production starring Neil Patrick Harris in 2014.

White House Condemns Anti-Media Video Shown at Pro-Trump Conference; Video shows fake version of President Trump shooting characters meant to represent media organizations

Texto completo: The White House said Monday that President Trump strongly condemns a graphic video that shows a fake version of the president shooting and attacking members of the news media and political rivals, but that he hadn't yet seen it.
The New York Times reported Sunday that the video was shown at a recent three-day conference put on by the pro-Trump group American Priority at Trump National Doral Miami. As described by the Times, the most violent piece of the video appears to be a doctored version of a scene from the 2014 film "Kingsman: The Secret Service." It shows Mr. Trump's head superimposed on the body of a man who shoots and attacks a series of people with the heads of his critics or with news logos over their faces.
Event organizer Alex Philips said in a statement that "an unauthorized video was shown in a side room at #AMPFest19. This video was not approved, seen, or sanctioned by the #AMPFest19 organizers."
Mr. Philips added that organizers weren't aware of the video until they were contacted by the New York Times and said the group "always has and always will condemn political violence," adding that there was a panel conversation condemning political violence during the event. Mr. Trump didn't attend the conference.
White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham tweeted Monday that the president hadn't seen the video and would see it shortly , "but based upon everything he has heard, he strongly condemns this video."
Jonathan Karl, president of the White House Correspondents' Association, said in a statement that the group was "horrified" by the video.
"All Americans should condemn this depiction of violence directed toward journalists and the President's political opponents," Mr. Karl said. "We have previously told the President his rhetoric could incite violence. Now we call on him and everybody associated with this conference to denounce this video and affirm that violence has no place in our society."
Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for the president's campaign, said in a statement that the "video was not produced by the campaign and we do not condone violence."
In the video, Mr. Trump's targets include Sen. Mitt Romney, the late Sen. John McCain, Sen. Bernie Sanders, former President Barack Obama and others.
Cindy McCain, Mr. McCain's widow, said on Twitter that reports of the video "violate every norm our society expects from its leaders & the institutions that bare their names. I stand w/ @whca in registering my outrage."
Mr. Trump has branded the media as the "enemy of the people" and regularly assails "fake news" on his Twitter feed and at his rallies. Two years ago he tweeted a doctored video that showed him assaulting a man whose face was covered by the CNN logo.
The president's son Donald Trump Jr. appeared at the conference. A spokesman said that he hadn't seen the video and didn't know about it's existence before the media reports, but he "strongly condemns the type of disgusting and graphic violence purported to be depicted in the video against members of the media."

Texto completo: Como miles de neoyorquinos que supieron del asesinato de cuatro hombres desamparados en Chinatown, el empresario Hakki Akdeniz expresó su tristeza y recordó que él mismo vivió en las calles.
En una entrevista con The New York Times y PIX11, Akdeniz , de 39 años, dueño de la cadena local de pizzerías, Champion Pizza, contó que fue al lugar donde encontraron los cuerpo.
“Estaba sorprendido” , dijo Akdeniz. Ha vuelto en varias ocasiones para dejar flores y velar en memoria de los hombres muertos.
Además, deja una pila de pizzas frescas para otros desamparados en el vecindario.
Hakki Akdeniz wept as he left candles, flowers, & pizza at the crimes scenes. He own a pizza shop & feeds the #homeless every wk. He used to be homeless himself & never turns away the hungry. 4 homeless men were savagely beaten to death as they slept in Chinatown. @abc7ny pic.twitter.com/Xi1A84ei4v
— Lucy Yang (@LucyYang7) October 7, 2019
Akdeniz dejó una carta expresando simpatía por la comunidad y tristeza por no haber estado allí para proteger a los hombres que fueron asesinados.
Además de ser conocido por sus habilidades al preparar la pasta para la pizza, a Akdeniz se le reconoce su dedicación para ayudar a la comunidad de personas sin hogar.
“A menudo entrega rebanadas gratis en sus restaurantes y reparte comida y ropa todos los lunes y miércoles”, reportó PIX11. “Hace varios años, comenzó a pagar una tarifa mensual en un gimnasio local para permitir que varias personas al día se duchen, y regularmente lleva a los grupos a una barbería para que le hagan un corte”.
Akdeniz, originario de Turquía, ayuda a la comunidad de personas sin hogar, debido a su propia experiencia de no tener hogar cuando se mudó a los Estados Unidos en 2001.
Llegó a Nueva York con $240 dólares en su bolsillo , durmió en un motel de $30 dólares por noche , pero cuando se le acabó el dinero, dormía en las estaciones de metro.
“Tenía grandes esperanzas, un gran sueño. Tenía un objetivo” , dijo Akdeniz. “Pero a veces la esperanza no es suficiente para alcanzar su objetivo”.
Después de trabajar en pizzerías y ahorrar dinero durante varios años, a finales de 2009, Akdeniz abrió su primera sucursal en el Bajo Manhattan. Las cosas no fueron fáciles y a menudo dormía debajo de su horno para ahorrar dinero.
Ahora tiene siete sursales, cinco en Manhattan, una en Brooklyn y otra en Queens.

Texto completo: Whether Seacoast homes or seaside cities are to be or not to be, that is the question. Sea levels are rising, storms and storm surges are growing more powerful, deluges are descending with greater frequency. In some places the land itself is sinking.

Globally, the news from the climate change front is mostly bad, though there is one bright spot. Most people now accept that climate change is a deadly threat caused chiefly by the burning of fossil fuels. Led by the world's youth, as symbolized by 16-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, the public appears ready to act. But will action come in time?
Last month the Boston Globe ran a stunning story documenting the damage already done to Cape Cod. Shrunken beaches, homes and businesses lost, marine life vanishing, the cape itself shrinking. Those who can afford to do so are paying to have their homes moved back from beaches and seaside cliffs. But for some, retreat is not an option.
Later this month, residents in communities like Hampton and Seabrook will get a better idea of what the sea might claim when a “king tide” produced by the aligned gravitational pull of the sun and moon occurs.
The state's Department of Environmental Services and UNH's Sea Grant program are seeking help from citizen scientists willing to download software that will allow them to photograph the king tide's impact.
Tides will be unusually high between Sunday, Oct. 27, and Wednesday, Oct. 30, and peak on the night of Oct. 29.
Coastal sea levels have risen roughly eight inches over the past century. The 2019 report on the flood risk facing New Hampshire warns that they will continue rising for centuries. Melting ice sheets in Greenland and the Antarctic are speeding the increase.
“Coastal New Hampshire is likely to experience a relative sea level rise of 1.5 to 3.8 feet by 2100. There is a 1-in-100 chance that (the increase) will exceed 5.3 feet by 2100 if greenhouse gas concentrations stabilize, or 6.5 feet by 2100 if greenhouse gas concentrations continue to grow,” the report said.
In the worst-case scenario, sea level rise along New Hampshire's coast could top 10 feet by the century's end. Meanwhile the risk of flooding from extreme rains continues to grow.
It's time, one of the report's authors said, for Seacoast communities to decide, given limited resources, what to save, what to move and what to let rising waters claim.
Taking arms against the rising sea is an option, but one that, if carbon emissions aren't quickly and drastically reduced, is almost certain to fail. Seawalls and jetties may buy property owners some time, but at vast expense. And who will pay?
Nationally, hundreds of billions of dollars worth of real estate are likely to be lost to flooding over coming decades. Mortgage failure rates, as people walk away from homes that are literally underwater, economists warn, could easily exceed those of the Great Recession.
So as if climate change and its accompanying tragedies aren't problems enough, New York Times reporter Christopher Flavelle, in a Sept. 30 story, warns that banks have begun to shift the risk of their investments in coastal real estate to taxpayers by offloading mortgages to government-backed lenders like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
We've seen this play before. It ends badly for taxpayers. It's time for Congress and regulators to bring the curtain down on a practice that leaves taxpayers drowning in debts they didn't sign up for.

Texto completo: He's a tireless catalyst of conflict with the right's opponents.
The Constitution depends on rivalry and jealousy. It may not be an engine of perpetual conflict, but the separate branches of government and chambers of Congress are supposed to be wary of encroachments on their authority. James Madison hoped that the multitude of interests represented in the legislature would prevent a single will, embodied in a unified majority, from exercising unlimited power.
These are things Americans learn as schoolchildren, but to see the adversarial psychology behind the Constitution play out in today's impeachment battles is still a shock to behold. President Trump and his White House simply refuse to cooperate with an inquiry opened by a House of Representatives controlled by Democrats. The Republican majority in the Senate looks set to stand by the president, notwithstanding some discomfort and dissent. The Constitution gives the House few powers to punish the president or coerce his compliance.
The public is rapidly becoming acquainted with the reality that impeachment is a political process, not an ordinary legal one. And the portion of the public that most strongly supports the president relishes the fight hardly less than his enemies do.
The defiant letter the White House counsel, Pat Cipollone, addressed to Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Representatives Adam Schiff, Elijah Cummings and Eliot Engel this week was the literary equivalent of one of Mr. Trump's raucous campaign rallies. It opened several lines of argument against the impeachment inquiry, including the idea that the inquiry's fundamentally unfair because it doesn't allow Mr. Trump to challenge accusers and their evidence.
But the arguments come second to the spirit behind them, the sheer audacity of defying Congress. Mr. Trump is not resorting to ideological niceties -- he's placing a constitutional struggle in its rawest, deepest psychological context: rival persons, rival powers, incompatible interests and passionate self-defense.
This is what his supporters respond to. It horrifies his opponents, and many onlookers as well, but it's a return to the foundations of Madisonian politics, as unlike James Madison as Donald Trump certainly is.
These feelings are the roots of a greater part of politics than rationalists dare admit. Passions and interests give rise to ideologies, more than ideologies arise from abstract reason. The parties and their allies in right-leaning or left-leaning media are not just hypocritical when they swap places over the investigative powers of Congress or the way an impeachment should be run. (Republicans have often championed Congress's investigative powers, from the House Un-American Activities Committee to the Benghazi hearings. Democrats saw impeachment rather differently in 1998 than they do now.)
The changing positions are, rather, reflections of the interests and rivalries that are foundational to a competitive political system. This doesn't make politics pretty, but it's what a realistic understanding of human nature leads one to expect.
Mr. Trump's most enthusiastic supporters recognized in him, three years ago or more, a permanent occasion for fighting Democrats and the progressive left. He is not an ideological president in the sense of having policy formulas ready to implement; he's instead a catalyst of conflict with the right's opponents.
He's a clarifier. And in some cases, he has clarified questions that don't resolve into the politics of left and right: when he has shown, for example, how little public commitment there is to bipartisan designs for multilateral trade deals and the exercise of American global leadership through new military interventions in troubled places.
Mr. Trump has done his part to widen the range of what can be discussed at the highest levels of politics. This has been a necessary corrective to the tendency of the country's political class to close ranks and merge minds.
Mr. Trump has been the nemesis to that class's intellectual hubris as well. The economy has flourished for three years under a president who pays no heed to economists. And if that doesn't necessarily vindicate the president's own positions, which he chooses for reasons that would not pass muster with theorists and ideologues, the record nonetheless calls into question the value of system-builders in policymaking.
Impeachment sharpens the lines that have already been drawn in the Trump era between left and right, the politics of pretense and the politics of rivalry. As useful as that may be in awakening some Americans to unpleasant realities, and much as others may enjoy the conflict itself for clarifying loyalties, the danger is that precedents too powerful for the good of the country will be set down in the process. A confrontation that exposes just what little authority Congress has to compel testimony from the executive branch will have far-reaching consequences, not least for the next time Republican lawmakers want to hold hearings on Democratic embarrassments like Benghazi.
Not every conflict is best brought out into the open, where the strength or weakness of either side is unmistakable. If the Constitution needs a certain spirit of conflict, it also needs a modicum of uncertainty about which powers can win.

Texto completo: He received widespread attention for his dramatic protest against the Roman Catholic Church after it blocked the passage of a reproductive health bill.
Carlos Celdran, a Philippine cultural activist and performance artist who received national attention for his dramatic protest against the Roman Catholic Church's stance on reproductive health, died on Tuesday in Spain, where he had been living in exile. He was 46.
His wife, Tesa, announced his death on Facebook. No other details were given.
In 2010 Mr. Celdran interrupted a Mass at the storied Manila Cathedral, dressed as José Rizal, an author who was considered a national hero after being executed by the Spanish in 1896 for leading a peaceful revolt against the colonial government. Mr. Celdran carried a large sign that read "DAMASO" -- a reference to Father Damaso, a character from one of Mr. Rizal's novels who symbolized corruption in the church.
In attendance were leaders of the church, whom he criticized for their role in blocking the passage of a reproductive health bill that would have helped the country's poorest women gain access to contraceptives.
The Philippines is Asia's only predominantly Catholic nation, and it is the only state aside from the Vatican that still bans divorce. Catholicism plays an outsize role in the country's political life as well, despite the separation of church and state spelled out in its constitution. The church was instrumental in galvanizing a so-called people power movement that led to the ouster of the dictator Ferdinand Marcos after his brutal two-decade rule.
The reproductive health bill, which set off a heated national debate, was stalled for more than a decade because of the church's opposition. The Philippine Congress ultimately approved it in 2012.
Birth control was already legal and available in the Philippines, but the cost of condoms, birth control pills and other contraceptive methods made them inaccessible to the very poor. The measure allowed for government health centers, including those in remote areas, to offer free or subsidized birth control options. It also required that sex education be provided in public schools.
The church had equated contraception with abortion, which is illegal in the Philippines.
Mr. Celdran's protest, on Sept. 30, 2010, lasted just a few minutes before he was arrested. A Supreme Court decision last year, upholding a lower court's decision from 2011, declared that he was guilty of "offending religious feelings" because his stunt was "meant to mock, insult, and ridicule those clergy whose beliefs and principles were diametrically opposed to his own."
He faced about a year in prison, but he fled to Spain.
"The life throws a curve ball," he said in a message to a friend who owned a bar in Manila. "For now, all is good. At least my exile isn't Siberia."
Mr. Celdran was born on Nov. 10, 1972, and grew up in Dasmariñas Village, in the Philippine city of Makati. He began his art career as a cartoonist for a newspaper in Manila when he was 14. In 1991 he enrolled in the Rhode Island School of Design, where he began doing performance art.
He later lived in New York City, where he witnessed the effects of the H.I.V. epidemic and began thinking about reproductive health and the importance of access to contraception.
Back in Manila in 2000, he found work as an assistant director for the Heritage Conservation Society, a nonprofit organization that seeks to preserve historical sites. In 2002 he started a walking-tour company, Walk This Way, and in 2005 he became the creative director of an art exhibition space in Manila, the Living Room.
Information on survivors was not immediately available.
Mr. Celdras had a charm that appealed as much to people in Manila's glitzy hotels as to people in the slums, where his friends included cigarette vendors and drivers of the horse-drawn carts that plied the tourist neighborhoods.
"When he talked to me about Manila, the Manila I see through his eyes is one of the 1930s -- pristine, quaint and full of lively, beautiful people," Inky Santiago Nakpil, a close friend, said.
Mr. Celdran adapted some of his walking tours into stage performances.
He said his most popular work was "If These Walls Could Talk," a one-man show that he presented onstage in Manila for more than 17 years.
A tour that focused on Imelda Marcos, the former first lady of the Philippines, became a solo Off Broadway show called "Livin' la Vida Imelda" in 2014. Reviewing his performance, Anita Gates wrote in The New York Times: "Mr. Celdran's one-act presentation is more like a gleefully gossipy study guide. If you examine it closely, you'll see that it's mostly just a lecture with black-and-white slides, but Mr. Celdran's charm and showmanship turn it into genuine theater."

Texto completo: Thirty years after he won the first of his six Ironman World Championships, Mark Allen still feels the spiritual power of Kona.
Mark Allen will forever be linked with the Ironman World Championships, which takes place Saturday on Hawaii's Big Island.
Allen won the race six times, most memorably in 1995, when he came back at 37 after a one-year hiatus and improbably made up more than 13 minutes on the leader in the marathon leg.
"I knew it was my last race," Allen said this week in an interview from Kona, where he will commentate on the digital stream of the event. "That freed me up because I knew there were no more tomorrows."
These days Allen, 61, coaches amateur triathletes looking for an edge. With Dave Scott, a chief rival back in the day, he put together a 10-episode series about their epic race in 1989, when Allen finally beat Scott after finishing second to him in 1986 and 1987.
Allen spoke with The New York Times about what it takes to win one of the toughest championships in the world and why Americans have struggled to win the event in the 21st century.
This conversation has been edited for clarity and condensed.
You're back in Kona. Any desire to hop into the competition?
I raced it 12 times. I love being here. I would miss it if I wasn't here. I have no desire to race again. Maybe in my next lifetime.
How did you get the bug out of your system?
The last time I raced was here in 1995. That was my sixth and final victory, and maybe the greatest of all because it was so difficult. When you are younger you can have great races and train all you want. At 37 I had to be much more diligent and careful. Then I came into the marathon 13 and a half minutes behind the leader. There was no way to make up 30 seconds per mile, but the miles kept going. I had a final talk with the Big Island and said "I am going to give this everything I have but I need something extra." I caught the leader at Mile 23. That is what brings out our best, when things seem impossible.
Did you feel extra pressure to perform well in your last race?
I knew this was my final Ironman. I didn't have to save anything for another day, another race, another time.
Why had you walked away previously?
My son was born a month after the 1993 race. I wanted to have more time to be a father and spend time with him.
There is irony in that because I know a lot of people who use triathlon training as a way to hide from their families.
That's true. For me it was my profession. I wanted to take time away from super-long training.
How has the sport changed since you were on top of the hill?
There have been huge technological advances, with Garmins and GPS and power measurements on your bike. We just had stopwatches. Also, the sport has become more of a global brand with top athletes from everywhere in the world. No one place has a stranglehold on elite athletes. It has grown up.
Why can't Americans win this event anymore?
It's been 17 years. In a lot of countries there is broader support for the development of Ironman champions. In Europe, a lot of countries have a strong club and federation system that helps them with training and coaching, and in the United States there is some support for kids interested in Olympic triathlon but not a lot for those who are trying to win at the Ironman distance.
You have mentioned the importance of tuning into your "inner space." What does that mean?
How do you quantify fear or self-doubt or passion or commitment. There are words where, if we are in those spaces in competition that will affect our race. It's being able to deal with the things that are not going to show up on a Garmin.
How do you do that over the course of a 141-mile competition?
This island is very powerful. There is a spiritual power. You feel this energy. You can't grasp it in your hand but you feel it when you get off the plane. I began to understand this when I studied Shamanism, with Brant Secunda. He got me to learn how to get to the start line and have the gun go off and let me surrender to whatever the day is going to bring.
How does that jibe with an intense desire to win?
That is the peak performance paradox. During every one of the six championships I won there were hundreds of moments where it didn't feel possible. You get into negative space and you have to draw back and regroup and take a breath and say, "What can I do?" And then focus on your rhythm and breathing, looking around at the lava and the beauty and the ocean, and then everything loosens back up. Those are amazing transformations when they happen and those are the moments that are like life. Life doesn't say, "If you give everything you have you will have a guarantee of getting what you want." Life says, "Give everything you have and then let's see what happens."
Do you miss the competition like so many retired athletes do?
I would not classify myself as a classically competitive person. Sport was a way for me to evolve as a person. Once gun went off it was sort of like floodwaters going over the levee. There was nothing that was going to hold me back from giving my best.
Which is different from a burning desire to win.
It is. If only one person wins does that mean everyone else is a loser? Absolutely not. Now, I think people who say they are only racing themselves are full of it, but you can be in cooperation with your competitors and see them as helping you to do your best.
Do you coach any of the top athletes?
My real passion is age-group athletes. If you change one or two things they are doing in training their performance goes up incredibly. Elite athletes are already getting 99 percent out of their D.N.A. They usually don't want to change and come to me thinking some magic will rub off, and it doesn't work that way.
Are you amazed at the massive popularity of what was once a fringe endeavor?
It's been a slow, natural progression but over the span of time it's mind-blowing how big it's become.

Texto completo: In times of crisis, history can be a comfort, reminding us that our own era is not nearly as dire or unique as we might think. James B. Stewart's new book, "Deep State: Trump, the FBI, and the Rule of Law," does the opposite: It's a first draft of history that reminds us just how bizarre these times really are. A New York Times columnist and Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter, Stewart has assembled a gripping blow-by-blow account of President Trump's years-long showdown with the FBI - from the first inklings of something about an email server through the release of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's report on Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election. Readers will be familiar with the basic outlines: the election itself, the Trump-Russia investigation, the firing of FBI director James Comey, the release of the Steele dossier. But encountering it all smashed between the pages of a single book is a new experience, less the stop-start jerkiness of a tweetstorm than the slow-build dread of a dramatic tragedy.
The central character in this story is not Trump but Comey, a "man of unimpeachable integrity" and "natural charm," in Stewart's telling, caught in a situation not of his own making - at least at first. Stewart does his best to get into the mind of the FBI director during the critical months leading up to the election, when Comey faced, in his own words, choices that looked "really bad" on the one hand, and "catastrophic" on the other. Readers may or may not agree with Comey's actions, especially his decision to notify Congress, just 11 days before the election, that he was reopening an investigation of Hillary Clinton because of emails found on the computer of former congressman Anthony Weiner, who was married to a top Clinton aide. But they will come away from Stewart's book with a better sense of how and why it all happened - and what on earth everyone was thinking and weighing behind the scenes.
The book chronicles who said what to whom, moment by moment, in meetings and memos, in personal texts and dinners à deux at the White House. Stewart's notes indicate that he conducted many interviews, but most were off the record. As a result, much of what makes it onto these pages comes from public sources, such as news reports, congressional testimony and official documents. This makes the book a timely guide for the layperson hoping to brush up on the whole sorry saga (who was George Papadopoulos again?), even if it does not yield new impeachment-worthy smoking guns. The events recounted in "Deep State" help explain how we ended up at our latest impasse and how Trump is likely to react as it unfolds.
What makes the book more than a recitation of unseemly facts is its well-rendered human drama. We see Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, furious that Trump tried to blame him for Comey's firing, feeling lonely and abandoned and wishing he could reach out to Comey for advice. We encounter FBI employees Lisa Page and Peter Strzok, looking on in anguish as their extramarital affair became national news and their ill-conceived political texts became fodder for denigrating the bureau. And of course we run into Trump, in all of his Mafia-don-turned-mad-king glory. Stewart includes only a fraction of the president's outrageous comments about "deep state" enemies, but they retain the power to shock. The book's description of Trump calling former president Barack Obama a "bad (or sick) guy!" and the Mueller staffers "some of the worst human beings on Earth" provides at least a momentary cure for outrage fatigue.
Which side Stewart comes down on will be no surprise. Though this is a work of just-the-facts journalism, the book's heroes and villains are perfectly clear. Its good-guys-vs.-bad-guys approach can sometimes produce excess: In Stewart's telling, Comey "oozed rectitude" and was at once "humble and credible," in full possession of the "loyalty, respect, and devotion from the vast majority" of FBI employees. Chalk this up as an overcorrection for Trump's theory of events, in which a conspiracy of self-interested, corrupt and highly partisan "deep state" workers first sought to deny him the election and then - for no apparent reason - to destroy his presidency.
If Stewart appreciates the human aspects of this confrontation, he also sees larger issues at stake. At the heart of the book, and of our recent politics, is a conflict over the very idea of nonpartisan, professional government work, so central to the identity of an agency like the FBI. Comey's dilemma in 2016 reflected a long-standing problem for the bureau: Located within the executive branch, tasked with staying outside partisan politics, the FBI has again and again been assigned highly politicized investigations, often within the executive branch itself. J. Edgar Hoover faced this issue throughout his 48 years at the FBI's helm, publicly touting his institution's independence while managing the policies, whims and partisan agendas of eight presidents. He managed to do it without getting fired, though it entailed no shortage of political hardball - and sometimes illegal activity - along the way.
In Stewart's telling, the men and women of the intelligence community now act as guardians of the best parts of this independent tradition - not the abuses of the Hoover era but the above-politics professionalism that remains such a deep part of bureau culture. This is how the book frames Comey's go-it-alone news conference in the summer of 2016, when he simultaneously excoriated Clinton for her handling of email and announced that she would not be prosecuted, all without consulting the attorney general. "Comey did it for one reason: to protect public confidence in the FBI as an independent, nonpartisan, and trustworthy agency," Stewart writes.
And therein lies the book's central tragedy. Hoping to prove that the FBI was above politics, Comey took actions that ultimately ensnared him in a vicious partisan battle and led to his downfall as director.
While "Deep State" emphasizes Comey's decision-making process, it also makes clear that there were other forces within the bureau shaping events. The most important of these were the "hotbeds of anti-Clinton hostility" in key field offices, including in New York. As Comey acknowledged in 2016, according to then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch, "there is a cadre of senior people in New York who have a deep and visceral hatred of Secretary Clinton" - and who, moreover, were likely to leak information about the Weiner emails if the news did not come from the director first. As Stewart notes, this reflects another long-standing aspect of bureau culture, which tends to be "politically conservative" as well as professionally independent. If there was anything like a partisan deep-state conspiracy in 2016, the book suggests, it came out of the New York office - and helped get Trump elected.
Though the election ultimately charted new territory, the preoccupation with leaks and potential leaks calls to mind another great political drama of the modern era: the Watergate scandal, which brought down Richard Nixon. Though "Deep State" was completed well before House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's embrace of impeachment, the specter of Watergate hovers throughout, a point of reference for the book's major players. Like Trump, Nixon came to office determined to bend the professional bureaucracy to his will. All too soon, he discovered that institutions like the FBI could not be pushed around so easily. During the first months after the Watergate burglary, FBI leadership kept the investigation open despite pressure from the White House - while FBI leaker Mark Felt, better known as Deep Throat, helped keep the story alive in the press. And when impeachment proceedings rolled around a few years later, Nixon was done in by the revelation that he had tried to use the CIA to strong-arm the FBI, a discovery that finally turned his fellow Republicans against him.
Today, many Trump critics are calling on Senate Republicans to follow a similar course, to reject White House leadership and declare that enough is enough. At the moment, the impeachment inquiry seems to be focused narrowly on the Ukraine controversy. As with Watergate, however, it will be indelibly shaped by the longer history of animosity between the White House and the intelligence community. "Deep State" delivers the critical first chapters of that story for the Trump era, as we all watch and wait to find out how it is going to end.

Anthony Davis sprains thumb, Lakers look tired in loss to Nets in China

Texto completo: The start of the sequence was something fans had been craving for months: As Anthony Davis corralled a defensive rebound, he sent an outlet pass sailing past the halfcourt line to a streaking LeBron James.
James ran under the rim for the lay-up … and missed it. He got his own rebound … and missed again right under the hoop.
Multiple blown lay-ups on one play is unusual to see from the 34-year-old star, but then again, it’s been an unusual trip.
Fatigue was the predominant trait of the Lakers in Saturday’s 91-77 loss to the Brooklyn Nets, the second of two exhibition games played under fraught geopolitical circumstances in China. The weight of international travel, atypical drama and playing their second game in three nights seemed to slow the Lakers down in Shenzhen: They scored just 36 points in the first half, looking listless against a Nets team that didn’t even suit up its best player, Kyrie Irving.
The most relevant portion of the night ended with some discouraging news: Davis, who made his first start at center in the team’s third preseason game, sprained his right thumb on a block. The Lakers ended up pulling him after one quarter, setting him up on the bench with a fresh wrap, and the new franchise centerpiece finished with just 6 points on 2-for-7 shooting.
The Lakers announced after the game that Davis would undergo diagnostic testing upon his return to Los Angeles, joining Kyle Kuzma, Quinn Cook and Jared Dudley as players who have been laid up with ailments recently.
No one else picked up the slack. James also played just one quarter, finishing with four assists and six points on 2-for-7 shooting including his misses near the basket. While team sideline reporter Mike Trudell shared that James spent much of the second half interacting with Chinese fans – thawing some of the chill that had set in earlier in the week between the NBA and the host country – he did little on the court to sate them.
The role players that have sparked some intrigue early did little to help blunt the impact of the star power outage. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Avery Bradley combined for 25 points, but required 25 shot attempts. Rajon Rondo, who started for the second consecutive game, had no assists and four turnovers in 16 minutes. JaVale McGee stood out in the first two exhibitions – on Saturday, he had a much more down-to-earth performance (9 points, 3 rebounds, 2 blocks). As a team, the Lakers shot just 33 percent, including 5 for 32 from 3-point range.
The small lineup with Davis at center struggled to create offense, but the Nets also struggled to score as well. After one quarter, a buzzer-beating 3-pointer by Alex Caruso had kept the Brooklyn lead to just 20-19 in a rock fight. While Davis has famously wished to play less center, he was a brutally efficient rim protector, getting a pair of blocks despite his injury.
Caris LeVert (22 points) helped pull Brooklyn back in pole position, putting on a well-rounded display after missing most of Thursday’s 114-111 Nets win that provided much more suspense. Taurean Prince added 14 points.
The Lakers were to fly back immediately Saturday, scheduled to reach Los Angeles late Saturday night or early Sunday morning. While the NBA decided Friday to not make media available for the rest of the trip, it seemed safe to assume the Lakers and the league welcomed the end of a whirlwind week that started with a flurry of outrage over Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeting in support of Hong Kong protests against the government.
The NBA has been under fire from both sides, as Chinese businesses pulled sponsorships and state-run television decided to blacklist the games. Back in the United States, the president was among the notable critics of the league for bowing to foreign interests. Shenzhen is just north of Hong Kong, giving rise to some concern that the Lakers’ second exhibition could have more tension than the first, but The New York Times reported that the Chinese government had asked the media and public to tone down the fiery rhetoric earlier in the week, soothing some of the angst.
The Lakers will play their first preseason game at Staples Center against the Golden State Warriors on Monday night. It’s unclear if any players will sit out on a short turnaround after a flight halfway across the globe.

This week's Nobel Prizes in literature? A home run and a strikeout

Texto completo: Two Nobel Prizes in literature were awarded this week, and both went to acclaimed European authors: Poland's Olga Tokarczuk and Austrian Peter Handke, who has an ugly political history. The two awards came after a #MeToo scandal that tore the prize committee apart and caused a hold in their selection process; now the Swedish Academy is trying to reestablish its credibility. But it's only been half-successful: These winners are a home run and a big miss. Handke is a disaster.
But let's begin with Tokarczuk, who has done nothing but diligently write her way to this crowning achievement. She's best known in America for her novel "Flights," which hit best-seller lists (a rare thing for a novel from Poland) and was a finalist for the National Book Award in Translated Literature. She has been lauded for excavating and remaking Polish history, and also for her deftness of character, phrasing and plot. While "Flights" is her biggest global hit,the Nobel Committee cited her 1,000-page historical novel "The Book of Jacob"as her "magnum opus." Next fall, Riverhead will publish it for the first time in English, translated by Jennifer Croft -- who shared the Man Booker International Prize with Tokarczuk for her English translation of "Flights."
This is exactly the kind of choice you might expect from a committee still smarting from scandal. In what I believe was an unprecedented move, the chair of the literature committee appeared on stage to describe, with full transparency, their current process. Previously, members before had lifetime appointments, which became problematic when the husband of a member was accused of sexual harassment and assault (he was later sentenced to two years in prison for rape). For now, the main committee members -- four or five writers and scholars -- will serve for two years, and will be assisted by five experts. The chair, Anders Olsson, stood ready to take questions from the audience.
Unfortunately, no one asked why they had given the award to Peter Handke, who notoriously spoke at Slobodan Milosevic's funeral, which took place after the former Serbian leader died in prison while on trial for war crimes and genocide.
Handke said "I am a writer and not a judge" in 2006 in an interview with The New York Times. But in the same breath, Handke, who is of Slovenian descent, continued, "I'm a lover of Yugoslavia -- not so much Serbia, but Yugoslavia -- and I wanted to accompany the fall of my favorite country in Europe, and this is one of the reasons to be at the funeral."
His appearance there was not without consequences. His nomination for the 50,000 Euro Heinrich Heine Prize was withdrawn, and he also withdrew from consideration. After he was met with protests after being awarded the Ibsen Prize in 2014, he declined to accept the prize money -- about $400,000 -- while telling his critics to "go to hell."
That the Norwegians behind the Oslo-based Ibsen Prize had overlooked Handke's longtime defense of Serbian fascism points to something, perhaps, in the Northern European character. Can't we all just get along? Maybe we could just stay up here and be neutral and chill?
Sweden's awarding the Nobel Prize in literature to Handke is clearly an effort to support art for art's sake, standing aside from politics. The committee wrote, "Although he has, at times, caused controversy he cannot be considered an engaged writer in the sense of Sartre, and he gives us no political programs."
Yet the literary community has noticed.In a statement, novelist Jennifer Egan, president of PEN America, said " We are dumbfounded by the selection of a writer who has used his public voice to undercut historical truth and offer public succor to perpetrators of genocide, like former Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic. ... We reject the decision that a writer who has persistently called into question thoroughly documented war crimes deserves to be celebrated for his 'linguistic ingenuity.' "
It's easy to watch the fall of a nation when you can go home to safety; less so when you are the victim of racist violence or are fighting for freedom.
I have never read Handke, and I don't plan to start now. Instead Olga Tokarczuk's books are going to the top of my list.

Declarations: Trump's Reckless Rush to Withdraw

Texto completo: One thing I think I've correctly observed about the U.S. military in the 21st century is that its leaders tend to be the last to want to go to war and the last to want to leave it. Political figures operate under public pressures and shifting geopolitical needs and goals; they're surrounded by people who see the world a certain way; they get revved up, and say, "Go, invade." Top military staff have reservations. They've studied the area, know the realities, the history -- they have doctorates in it -- and don't want to get into anything America can't win cleanly, decisively, relatively quickly. They're skeptics.
In the end the commander in chief makes the decision and they do their constitutional duty. Troops are deployed and perform. They dig in and fight, they're professionals -- they commit.
The political figures then decide after a few years -- or decades -- that it's time to come home. Military leaders are skeptical again. They've been in this thing a while, they're committed to the battle space, they've lost men, they know and care about their allies in the fight, they have a sharp sense of the repercussions of withdrawal. They want more time.
I suspect the current habit of skepticism springs in part from the military's generations-long reckoning with Vietnam. You can see it in Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster's influential 1997 book, "Dereliction of Duty." "The war in Vietnam was not lost in the field, nor was it lost on the front pages of the New York Times," Donald Trump's second national security adviser writes. "It was lost in Washington, D.C." Responsibility for the failure rested not only with President Lyndon B. Johnson and his civilian advisers but also his military advisers, particularly the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Between the lines Gen. McMaster was telling the current military: Don't claim to see lights at the ends of tunnels when you don't really see them, play it straight. Be forthcoming with political leaders -- and the public -- about "likely costs and consequences."
Anyway, history is human. Military leaders have their ways and biases. But public military opposition to the president's withdrawal of U.S. forces from northern Syria, after a Sunday telephone call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, seems to me completely correct. Gen. John Allen, a retired Marine, said, "If we were going to draw a circle around a group of American troops who are more important right now to the stabilization of any place on the planet, it's that thousand troops." He said of Turkey's incursion into Syria, "This is just chaos." Retired Adm. James Stavridis said it will lead to the comeback of ISIS and embolden other U.S. adversaries. He noted that it's some kind of policy that can unite, in opposition, Sens. Lindsey Graham and Bernie Sanders.
It is.
More compelling is what Jennifer Griffin, the respected national-security correspondent for Fox News, reported Wednesday night. She spoke to a "distraught" U.S. Special Forces soldier on the ground alongside the Kurdish forces that were about to be abandoned. "It was one of the hardest phone calls I have ever taken," she tweeted. The soldier told her "I am ashamed for the first time in my career." He said, "There was no threat to the Turks -- none -- from this side of the border." The Kurds, who are guarding thousands of ISIS prisoners, had just prevented a prison break and were pleading for U.S. support. Without it, the soldier said, those detainees would likely soon be free. Of the president: "He doesn't understand the problem. He doesn't understand the repercussions to this." "It's a shame," he added. "The Kurds are standing by us. No other partner I have ever dealt with would stand by us."
I believe every word of this.
Why this decision? Why now?
To redeem a campaign pledge with another campaign looming? On impulse? What was behind the impulse? The president doesn't seem to know much about the Kurds -- that they've backed the U.S. since 2003 and fought ISIS since 2011. They have their reasons: They want their own state. But they are a gallant people, brave and sympathetic to the West.
The president, defending this decision, asked what we owe them. "They didn't help us in the Second World War, at Normandy for example."
Yes, I forgot. Reagan made that point in his Pointe du Hoc speech. He said, "Don't forget to stick it to the Kurds for not showing up." Oh wait, he didn't say that, because he was quite the reader of history.
Mr. Trump, in defending his position, says he is against the "endless wars" that have marked the first two decades of this century. Fair and good, the right approach, he ran for president opposing them and Americans left and right agreed.
But there is too much craziness to the decision, both its substance and how it was made. The area has been functioning, the number of U.S. troops small and limited. Adm. Stavridis called it "a small investment with a big spring to it."
The decision was done on the word of Mr. Erdogan, a particular kind of player -- thuggish, duplicitous. He considers the Kurds on his border a security threat. He threatens to send Syrian refugees to Europe if European countries call his incursion an occupation. If they insult him like that, "We will open the gates and send 3.6 million refugees your way."
Mr. Trump himself says if the ISIS terrorists the Kurds are holding in prison are freed or escape, no worry. "They're going to be escaping to Europe," he said. "They want to go back to their homes."
That's a viciously careless way to treat your allies. Who, by the way, were at Normandy.
Most unsettling was the president's mad tweet assuring critics that his decision was right: "If Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey (I've done before!)." This isn't funny, it's self-inflated nut stuff.
The president is misreading his base, which will have qualms. Their sons and daughters fought in the wars; they know who the Kurds are.
Why would he do such a dramatic, piercing thing at what is for him a dramatic, piercing moment, with impeachment looming and support for it rising in the polls? Why offend Republicans senators, whom the president needs to survive impeachment? Why give them an excuse to start peeling off?
Why give those of his supporters who are cable-news hacks an excuse to show some pride? I'm not a lackey, this is about principle, the president has made a misjudgment! Watch it, they could get in the habit of self-respect.
The Syria decision contributes to the hardened impression that in foreign policy he's all impulse, blithely operating out of his depth. It adds to the hardening suspicion that in negotiations he's not actually tough; he'll say yes to a lot of things, and some very bad things, to get the deal, the photo-op, the triumphant handshake.
Foreign-policy decisions in this administration look like the ball in a pinball machine in some garish arcade with flashing lights and some frantic guy pushing the levers ping ping ping and thinking he's winning.

America's Most Republican Faith Is Also One of the Most Skeptical of Trump

Texto completo: The reddest faith in America is also the one most skeptical of Donald Trump.
In order to understand the Republican Party today, you have to understand religion. Donald Trump may be the most unreligious president ever -- an undisciplined force of corrosive evil. And yet he tweets comparisons to himself as the Messiah and bullies his way around the world with the blind support of white evangelical Christians.
But the one religious faith that is the most heavily Republican is also somewhat disgusted with Trump. Barely half the members of the American-grown Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints approve of his presidency.
And therein lies the best chance, though it's very much a long shot, to remove Trump from office. Wait! Mormons -- forged from a polygamous theocracy in the Rocky Mountain West, tainted by decades of institutional racism and still very much opposed to marriage equality -- to the rescue of the Republic? Maybe.
We know that the rule of law, the Constitution's granting of "the sole power of impeachment" to the House, is toilet paper to many congressional Republicans. When Trump said Article II of our governing blueprint "allows me to do whatever I want," and almost no members of his party begged to differ, you could see what was ahead. Banana Republicans rule.
Expelling Trump will be decided by appeals to our better angels. At this moment, those angels with the most influence are Mormons with an R on their jerseys. Mormons believe the Constitution, which doesn't mention God except in the document's date, to be divinely inspired.
And yes, that means our nation turns its lonely eyes to Mitt Romney, the Utah senator, former Republican presidential nominee and most prominent face of his faith on the planet. In order to understand Romney you have to understand his Mormon beliefs.
With their missionary experience, and a fast-growing Latino membership, Mormons are appalled at Trump's anti-immigrant cruelties. On family values, many of them actually walk the talk -- which explains why just 14 percent of Utah voters viewed Trump as a good role model.
I would say "We are all Mitt Romney now" after he was scorched by Trump for lashing out at the president's gangster foreign policy. Except that Romney himself famously said that 47 percent of Americans are moochers who would never vote for him for president. Irony alert: Romney ended up with 47 percent of the popular vote.
And it was another Mormon senator, the unfortunately named Jeff Flake of Arizona, who led an earlier charge against Trump. This week, Flake, who has since left the Senate, tweeted, "Fellow Republicans, where is the line?"
That will be the central question before the Senate. It would take 20 Republicans, along with everyone in the Democratic caucus, for the Senate to reach the two-thirds majority required to remove Trump. The winless New York Jets have a better shot at the Super Bowl.
The political calculation will guide some, but not all. There are already breaches in the Fox News firewall, and a stunning 28 percent of Republican voters in one recent poll favor the impeachment inquiry.
Playing to the larger moral issues is where the Mormon charge will be crucial. Another Mormon senator, Mike Crapo of Idaho, has kept an open mind thus far. An independent presidential candidate from 2016, Evan McMullin, has been a principled Mormon critic of Trump's lawlessness.
"Remember that Trump will tear down anyone who rightfully challenges him," McMullin said this week. "Unable to lead with honor, all he has left is to make everyone seem as rotten as he is."
The rot among the collaterally rotten is already deep. White evangelicals -- having looked the other way while the Stable Genius, showing his "great and unmatched wisdom," put kids in cages, praised neo-Nazis, sucked up to murderous dictators and betrayed our beleaguered allies the Kurds -- are gone, lost to the dark side.
Most despicable of all, the Dallas pastor Robert Jeffress has suggested that impeaching Trump could cause a "Civil War-like fracture" in the country. Jeffress has also said terrible things about Jews, Mormons and Catholics -- the kind of hate talk that has not kept him from being one of Trump's closest evangelical advisers.
You have to believe that most Republicans in Congress know Trump has violated his oath of office. But most of them are also cowards. That goes for some Mormon Republicans, such as Senator Mike Lee of Utah, a former Trump critic, now an enabler. For them, the old line from J.R. Ewing is apt: "Once you give up your integrity, the rest is a piece of cake."
Romney has never caved, though he nearly joined the Trump administration as secretary of state. In 2016, he called Trump "a fraud" whose promises "are as worthless as a degree from Trump University."
With Trump's Ukraine betrayals, Romney has signaled that he will be a ballast of conscience for Republicans in the Senate. His seat is safe till 2024. He has nothing to lose. At long last, he has a chance to make history -- for his faith, and his country.

Renee Moilanen: The fine line between education and indoctrination

Texto completo: My son came home from school the other day vexed.
His fourth-grade class was planning a party and the teacher suggested Chick-fil-A. The other children were ecstatic. My son panicked.
“We don’t eat Chick-fil-A,” he told me.
Which is true. He’s long heard me rant about the company, which has taken a strong stand against same-sex marriage. Our gay friends deserved equal treatment, even from a fast-food joint, I told my son, and he took it to heart.
But now, his reaction to the class party made me regret all those times I vented about Chick-fil-A or Hobby Lobby or any of the other organizations that comprised my boycott list.
Like all parents, I want my children to reflect our family’s values. But more than that, I want them to be critical thinkers who assess the facts, weigh both sides and draw their own informed conclusions about an issue even if they disagree with Mom and Dad. And I certainly didn’t want my son to skip a class party over Chick-fil-A.
The line between moral education and indoctrination is a thin one. Maybe we’d crossed it.
I commiserated with a friend, whose son ran on a pro-immigration platform for his kindergarten class president campaign. The other candidates promised ice cream and slime parties and to not talk when the teacher is talking.
Her son’s campaign poster read (spelling corrected): “If I was a president, I would change the world and make sure that Donald Trump would not make a wall.”
We got a kick out of it and I thought her son’s moral grounding was admirable. She did, too. But she also wondered, like me, if too much political talk works against us in the long run.
The research bears this out. At first, children of politically active partisan parents adopt the ideals of their parents, found a 2013 study in the British Journal of Political Science. But as they become adults, these children are more likely than others to abandon those ideals and embrace the opposing side. Turns out, early indoctrination only gets you so far.
In our house, we watch the news and read articles from the New York Times and Atlantic magazine to both children, even to the 4-year-old. The kids come with me to the polls on voting day and when I canvass the neighborhood for a candidate. They know democracy takes work, and we all need to roll up our sleeves.
But nuance is an acquired perspective, and frankly, some of us never learn it. For children, grasping nuance and context and concept is nearly impossible, which is why they fixate on concrete representations of our beliefs – walls and Chick-fil-A.
For my son to truly understand why I don’t eat Chick-fil-A, he’d have to understand our country’s founding vision under the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, centuries of intolerance and repression backed by government policy, Stonewall, capitalism, collective action, economic boycotts and corporate responsibility. And then he’d have to accept the reality that even if he skips the class party, Chick-fil-A may still stand against our gay friends.
But I had to try. In the long run, raising a child without critical thinking skills would be far worse for our democracy than eating Chick-fil-A.
Together, my son and I read articles about Chick-fil-A, how the company had used funds from its charitable foundation to oppose same-sex marriage and to support wonderful programs for communities in need. We talked about boycotts and how we as consumers can withhold our dollars to effect change in a company’s policies. We discussed whether this dynamic changes if someone else – say, his fourth-grade teacher – buys Chick-fil-A.
My son thought long and hard. In the end, he said, “I don’t think I can eat it.” I promised to pack him a lunch. And if it turns out he can’t resist the chicken nuggets, that’s okay too. He can save the lunch for another day.

Texto completo: The Partnership for New York City says the mayor should not adopt a model of profligate spending. Also: Ukraine's president in a fix; domestic terror; bias in an H.I.V. drug.
To the Editor:
Re "Bill de Blasio Needs to Get to Work" (editorial, Oct. 7):
It is hard to disagree with the call for the mayor to refocus on local problems after his withdrawal from the presidential race. But the editorial board's agenda for the balance of the mayor's term is pretty one-sided.
You urge expanded investment in affordable housing, public hospitals, safer streets and other worthy causes. But what about fiscal challenges, unfunded pension and health care benefits due public employees, and mounting debt?
Ironically, the editorial suggests that Mayor John Lindsay did the right thing when he returned from the presidential trail with "his tail between his legs" and during his lame-duck years committed the city to ambitious projects that he cared passionately about.
The editorial doesn't mention that Mr. Lindsay's profligate spending and poor management drove the city into bankruptcy, for which all New Yorkers paid dearly over the next two decades.
This is surely not the model the city's taxpayers want Mayor de Blasio to emulate!

The Ukrainian's Predicament
To the Editor:
Re "Volodymyr Zelensky, Man in the Muddle" (editorial, Oct. 9):
Most of us have on occasion found ourselves trapped in conversation with a hectoring, ill-informed lout. In such awkward situations, a common strategy is to feign agreement until an opportunity for escape presents itself.
Mr. Zelensky's predicament was complicated by the fact that his country, Ukraine, desperately needs American military aid. He was, as you say, caught between a rock and a hard place. Furthermore, he is an inexperienced negotiator.
Against a world-class intimidator like President Trump, Mr. Zelensky had little hope of coming away from the July 25 phone call with his dignity fully intact. But he appears to be a man of intelligence and honor; I am confident that he will soon be able to put this embarrassing episode behind him and get on with the job of guiding Ukraine toward prosperity and peace.
I wish him well.

Acting on Domestic Terrorism
To the Editor:
Re "New Focus at Homeland Security on Domestic Terrorism" (news article, Oct. 2):
There is now little doubt that recent mass shootings by white supremacists are part of a larger continuum of domestic terrorism. These involve plots not just against the Jewish community but many other minorities, including Muslims, African-Americans, and the Latinx and L.G.B.T.Q. communities.
The fact that there is now a formal framework document from the Department of Homeland Security addressing the threat of white supremacist terrorism -- while emphasizing civil liberties protections and the need to engage with affected communities -- is an encouraging development.
But this needs to be followed up with a robust, comprehensive executive-branch plan of action that devotes not just words but also federal resources and an overarching federal strategy to address this threat from multiple angles.
There is also an important role for Congress, including the passage of the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act, which would require federal law enforcement agencies to regularly assess threats.

An H.I.V. Drug, but Not for Women
To the Editor:
Re "F.D.A. Approves a New H.I.V.-Prevention Drug, but Not for Women" (news article, Oct. 5):
A drug company, one that has already been cited for exorbitant pricing, now puts out a new H.I.V.-prevention drug that it tested only on men. The company will get around to women later, toward the end of 2020, it says.
And the name of the company? Gilead. You can't make this stuff up. Oh, wait, the world already did (over and over again), and Margaret Atwood captured it back in the 1980s.

NBCU Refuses to Air Trump Campaign Ad Aimed at Joe Biden; Commercial, rejected by CNN last week, alleges Democratic candidate promised Ukraine $1 billion to fire prosecutor

Texto completo: Comcast Corp.'s NBCUniversal won't air a Trump re-election campaign ad on any of its cable networks unless changes are made to the spot, according to a person familiar with NBCU.
The 30-second commercial contains an unsubstantiated claim about former Vice President Joe Biden's role in the ouster of a Ukrainian prosecutor. The ad, which CNN rejected last week, alleges Mr. Biden, who is vying for the Democratic nomination, promised Ukraine $1 billion to fire a prosecutor looking into a Ukraine gas company with ties to his son Hunter Biden.
The ad also accuses "media lap dogs" of aiding the Democrats with their impeachment efforts and features a montage of cable-news personalities and correspondents, such as CNN's Don Lemon, Chris Cuomo and Jim Acosta and MSNBC's Rachel Maddow.
It couldn't be learned what changes NBCU requested. The Trump campaign didn't make the changes, the person said. Instead, it submitted another re-election campaign ad called "Changing Things," which has subsequently aired on NBCU properties.
"Our ads are 100 percent accurate," said Tim Murtaugh, a Trump campaign spokesman. "The discussions with NBC had nothing to do with the facts as presented in the ad. We have no further comment on those conversations."
President Trump is facing an impeachment inquiry that stems in part from his dealings with Ukraine and reports that he withheld aid to Ukraine while he was pressing the country to investigate candidate Joe Biden.
NBCU's decision was made after the company aired the spot one time on its cable-news network MSNBC and on its entertainment network Bravo, the person familiar with the matter said.
CNN declined to air the spot because it didn't meet the network's ad standards. "In addition to disparaging CNN and its journalists, the ad makes assertions that have been proven demonstrably false by various news outlets, including CNN," the company said.
The moves by NBCU and CNN highlight the different standards that exist between media companies and tech platforms such as Facebook Inc.
Facebook denied a request from Mr. Biden's campaign to take down a nearly identical re-election campaign ad , a move that reignited the scrutiny the social-media giant has come under for its role in spreading misinformation during the 2016 presidential election.
A Facebook spokeswoman said the ad wasn't eligible for fact checking because Mr. Trump is a candidate, a position that the company said is longstanding.
"In mature democracies with a free press, political speech is already arguably the most scrutinized speech there is," Katie Harbath, Facebook's elections policy director, wrote to the Biden campaign in response to a complaint about the ad. "However politicians, like everyone else on Facebook, must continue to comply with our terms, including our advertising policies."
The New York Times earlier reported Facebook's denial of Mr. Biden's request.
Not all media companies have declined to air the spot. It has aired on broadcast networks such as CBS and Fox, according to iSpot.tv, an ad-tracking firm.
Unlike Facebook and national cable-TV companies, broadcast networks have little wiggle room when it comes to political advertising because they are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission. The FCC prohibits broadcasters from censoring or refusing to air ads that come from legally qualified political candidates, according to the FCC. Even if a candidate's political ad has false claims, broadcast networks aren't allowed to refuse to air the spot, according to the rules, which also apply to local broadcast stations.
"Effectively, candidates can say whatever they want and broadcast networks must air it," said David Oxenford, a partner at Wilkinson Barker Knauer LLP. Mr. Oxenford points out that the requirement is written into the Communications Act. Because Congress prohibits broadcasters from censoring such ads, broadcasters have immunity from liability arising from the content of such ads, he added.
Although national cable networks don't have to follow FCC regulations, several networks—such as Discovery Inc.'s Investigation Discovery and Fox Corp.'s Fox News—have also aired the contentious spot, iSpot data shows.
"We are not in the business of censoring ads from candidates on either side of the aisle," Fox News said.
Fox Corp. and Wall Street Journal parent News Corp share common ownership. Meanwhile, Discovery's internal guidelines state the company accepts candidate ads from all political parties, according to a person familiar with Discovery.

Texto completo: Dozens of former patients are preparing a lawsuit against an ex-Long Island pediatrician who was stripped of his medical license in 2000 following numerous complaints of sexual abuse.
Nearly two decades ago, Newsday chronicled the case of Stuart Copperman, a Merrick physician whose license was revoked after at least six women told a state hearing panel he had molested them as young girls. The complaints covered an 11-year period ending in 1989.
At the time, the women were barred by statute of limitations laws from filing lawsuits. But a new state law has changed that.
An attorney representing the women said Wednesday they are seeking to file the complaint using a special look-back period provided by New York's Child Victims Act, which was enacted recently.
The law created a one-year window, which opened in August, suspending the normal time limits on lawsuits and allowing victims to file civil claims no matter how long ago the alleged abuse occurred.
"We do intend to file suit," said Kristen Gibbons Feden, an attorney representing the women. She couldn't say when the claim would be filed. "We're still in the investigative stage," she said.
The New York Times first reported the women's intent to sue.  
The women have launched a Facebook page, "Victims of Dr. Stuart Copperman," where they say there are "50+ of us, which we believe to be the tip of the iceberg."
On the page, the group says: "Sexually molested as children, we call for justice."
An attorney for the former physician didn't immediately return messages for comment Wednesday. Contacted by the Times, Copperman said he did "not care to revisit" old allegations.
The opportunity to pursue decades-old allegations of sexual abuse came about because of the 2018 statewide elections.
A new Democratic majority in the state Senate spurred enactment of the Child Victims Act as one of its first actions after taking power in January. The measure was opposed by the Catholic Church and bottled up by a Republican-led Senate for years.
The Democrat-led Assembly and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, also backed the legislation.
On Aug. 14, the day the one-year look-back period opened, 427 lawsuits were filed across New York, according to the state Office of Court Administration. As of Wednesday, the total had grown to 858, including 48 in Nassau County and 20 in Suffolk.
Many of the high-profile lawsuits target institutions and large entities, such as Catholic dioceses or the Boy Scouts. Lawsuits against individuals will be rarer, critics have said, because there is less financial incentive to bring a case to court.  
The allegations against Copperman span decades.
In December 2000, the New York Office of Professional Medical Conduct revoked Copperman's license after receiving testimony from six women. They said the doctor abused them during physical exams when they were between the ages of 14 and 20, although they all had been his patients since childhood.
Newsday reported at the time the panel cited "the egregiousness" of Copperman's conduct and "his continued denial of any inappropriate behavior."
Similar charges against him had been dismissed in 1987 by the state Board of Regents, which oversaw medical conduct issues at the time. Later, oversight was transferred to the state Health Department.
Copperman denied any wrongdoing during the medical board proceedings, fought unsuccessfully to retain his license and later moved to Florida. He had operated his practice in his Merrick basement for four decades before losing his license.
The state panel's action sparked an even greater wave of complaints to the Health Department about the doctor, along with a 2004 episode of NBC's Dateline.
Before the Child Victims Act, New York's statute of limitations required civil claims or criminal charges to be filed by the victim's 23rd birthday.
Beyond the one-year period, the new law extends the deadline for filing a civil claim to a person's 55th birthday.
In a post, members of the Facebook group said they had come together after a wave of stories about Dr. Larry Nassar, the former athletic physician at Michigan State University and USA Gymnastics. In January 2018, Nassar was sentenced to 40 to 175 years in prison after hundreds of women accused him of sexually abusing them under the guise of treatment.  
"After the recent criminal prosecution of Dr. Nassar which reopened a lot of old wounds, dozens of us independently took to social media to see if anything had ever been done about Dr. Copperman," the Facebook post reads. "We survived something so similar th

Matt Lauer is further accused; he speaks out; A prior allegation is said in a new book to be rape. The anchor, once silent, replies.

Texto completo: It has been nearly two years since Matt Lauer was fired from NBC's "Today" show for inappropriate sexual conduct, but the event is still sending tremors through the network.
The upcoming book "Catch and Kill: Lies, Spies, and a Conspiracy to Protect Predators" by investigative journalist Ronan Farrow says Lauer allegedly raped the female colleague whose complaint led to his downfall, according to a report in Variety.
Brooke Nevils told Farrow that Lauer forced her to have anal sex in a hotel room in Sochi, Russia, while the "Today" team was covering the 2014 Winter Olympics, the book says.

Nevils, who was interviewed by Farrow and agreed to reveal her identity, worked as an assistant to Meredith Vieira, Lauer's co-anchor at the Olympics.
Nevils told Farrow she was drinking heavily the night of the incident. She had gone to Lauer's room twice -- once to retrieve an Olympics press credential that he had taken as a joke and a second time at his invitation.
Farrow wrote that "she had no reason to suspect Lauer would be anything but friendly based on prior experience."
Nevils alleged that once she was in Lauer's hotel room, he pushed her against a door and kissed her before pushing her onto the bed and asking her if she liked anal sex. She declined several times, but he "just did it," according to the book. She said she wept into a pillow during the incident.
"It was non-consensual in the sense that I was too drunk to consent," Nevils said in the book. "It was non-consensual in that I said, multiple times, that I didn't want to have anal sex."
Nevils told Farrow she had more sexual encounters with Lauer after the incident. She said she was fearful that he had control over her career. Farrow wrote that sources close to Lauer said Nevils sometimes initiated their meetings.
Nevils told Vieira about the Sochi incident in 2017. Vieira told her to report it to NBC's human resources department with a lawyer. Lauer was terminated the day after Nevils and her attorney met with NBC.
In a report Wednesday on "Today," the network said in a statement: "Matt Lauer's conduct was appalling, horrific and reprehensible as we said at the time. That's why he was fired within 24 hours of us first learning of the complaint. Our hearts break for our colleague."
Lauer's attorney provided an open letter from his client to Variety, calling allegations that the encounter was an assault "categorically false." He described having "an extramarital affair" with Nevils in 2014 and reiterated that their relationship was consensual.
"It's outrageous," Lauer said in the letter. "So, after not speaking out to protect my children, it is now with their full support that I say 'enough.' "
"The story Brooke tells is filled with false details intended only to create the impression that this was an abusive encounter," Lauer wrote in the open letter. "Nothing could be further from the truth." Nevils, he said, was "a fully enthusiastic and willing partner" that night and "seemed to know exactly what she wanted to do."
Lauer has previously denied that any of the sexual relationships he had with women who worked with him were non-consensual.
Nevils' allegations in the book stunned Lauer's former "Today" colleagues, who reported on them on Wednesday's program.
"This is shocking and appalling, and I honestly don't even know what to say about it," co-anchor Savannah Guthrie said. "I think I speak for all of us when I say we're disturbed to our core."
The book reveals that Nevils received a seven-figure payout from NBC when she left the network. NBC also reached a financial settlement with another woman who had a complaint against Lauer, who spoke to Farrow but did not want to be identified.
In a memo obtained by the Los Angeles Times, NBC News Chairman Andy Lack said the payments to Nevils and the other woman were made after Lauer was fired and did not have non-disclosure agreements attached.
Lack also said that NBC News used the term "sexual misconduct" to describe the reason for Lauer's firing to "mirror the public words at that time" of the attorney representing Nevils.
The memo also criticizes Farrow's book, which claims NBC News slow-walked his investigation to his reporting on alleged sexual harassment, assault, rape and abuse of power by movie mogul Harvey Weinstein during his long career.
Farrow shared a Pulitzer Prize with New York Times reporters Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey for his reporting on the Weinstein scandal, which ran in the New Yorker in October 2017. Farrow took his reporting to the New Yorker out of frustration that NBC News did not believe his story was ready to air.
"Farrow's account has become neither more accurate, nor more respectful of the dedicated colleagues he worked with here at NBC News," Lack wrote. "He uses a variety of tactics to paint a fundamentally untrue picture."
NBC News executives have maintained that they supported Farrow's reporting on the Weinstein scandal but would not budge from their position that he needed a victim or witness to the mogul's alleged behavior to be identified on camera for the story to air.
NBC News executives have said said none of the seven victims whom Farrow named in his meticulously reported New Yorker piece -- Asia Argento, Mira Sorvino, Rosanna Arquette, Lucia Evans, Emma de Caunes, Jessica Barth and Sophie Dix -- was willing to speak on the record or be identified on camera to discuss the allegations.
A representative for Farrow said "the claims by NBC's senior management about Ronan Farrow's reporting are simply not true, as his book will methodically demonstrate. In fact, relevant sections of the book confirm not only how many women were on the record, but also how much proof Ronan had gathered."
Among the allegations in the book, which was given in advance to the Hollywood Reporter for a cover story on Farrow out Wednesday, are Weinstein's efforts to use information the movie mogul had about Lauer's behavior as leverage to shut down the investigation.
According to Farrow, Weinstein met with Dylan Howard, chief content officer of American Media Inc. -- publisher of the National Enquirer -- in September 2017 to go over material gathered by the supermarket tabloid about Lauer's behavior.
"Weinstein made it known to the network that he was aware of Lauer's behavior and capable of revealing it," Farrow writes.
NBC News executives have said they had no knowledge of Weinstein using information on Lauer to shut down Farrow's investigation, which has circulated as a rumor since Lauer was fired.
Farrow had already taken his reporting to the New Yorker by the time the meeting between Weinstein and Howard is said to have taken place, NBC executives said.

‘Triumph of Injustice’ lays out how the richest pay the lowest taxes

Texto completo: I’m sure there are many terrible burdens that come with living in the highest income households in America, but, luckily, thanks to the vagaries of the U.S. tax code, paying the highest tax rate isn’t one of them.
David Leonhardt’s most recent New York Times column lays out the details.
In the first paragraph, when I said “highest tax rate,” I should have said “highest effective tax rate,” which refers to the rate — as a percentage of its gross income — a household actually pays in taxes to all levels of government, local, state and federal. But, of course, that’s exactly the number we should look at, rather than assuming that a progressive income tax structure would guarantee that the richest pay the highest rate, because the effective rate shows what a household paid after all the deductions and other elements of the tax code that shelter a portion of income from taxation.
And those shelters are a lot more valuable and a lot more utilized by people who make enough to be taxed in the higher brackets.
OK, I buried the lead, as we say in journalism, which refers to failing to disclose the main point of an article in the first paragraph. If you click through the top of the Leonhardt column, you will see that the 400 wealthiest households not only found a way to get their actual tax bill, as a percent of their income from all sources, below the mere billions in the 99th percentile, or the 90th, but even, believe it or not, below the median.
But wait, I still buried the lead. According to Leonhardt’s column, the 400 highest-income households pay a lower overall tax rate, taking into account all forms of federal, state and local taxation, than do those households in the bottom zero to 10 percent.
It’s hard to figure out how that could work. But Leonhardt derives this fact from a not-yet published book, called “The Triumph of Injustice,” due for release next week. Authors Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman are professors at the University of California, Berkeley. Leonhardt says both profs have “done path breaking work on taxes.” Saez has been named the top academic economist under 40. Zucman has been nicknamed “the wealth detective,” presumably for his ability to figure out how and where the wealthiest hide their do-re-mi.

Texto completo: DeAndre Somerville is not the only person Circuit Judge John Kastrenakes has sentenced to jail for failing to show up to jury duty, according to Palm Beach County court records.
After Kastrenakes gained national attention this month for sentencing the 21-year-old with no criminal record to 10 days because he overslept for jury duty, another case from early this year emerged.
Keith Lattimore, who was reportedly selected to be in a pool of potential jurors in 2018, served nine days in jail for contempt after Kastrenakes said he did not report to his courtroom to be questioned alongside other jurors.
When told about the other juror case, Somerville said it “goes to show it can happen
to anybody.”
In an interview Tuesday, Somerville said his prayers were answered when he got word Kastrenakes vacated his charges.
The 21-year-old from West Palm Beach already is back at work, trying to make up for the time he spent in jail. He said he did not expect to be in the national spotlight because of his story. But, he said, he’s trying to turn it into something positive.
“Now I’m known as the kid who spent 10 days in jail,” he said Tuesday. “I want (the headlines) to say he’s making positive change for his community.”
Lattimore, who initially said he was willing to talk about his experience, could not be reached for comment Tuesday.
There are similarities and differences in the two cases.
Both Somerville and Lattimore are black men in their 20s who were found in contempt of court before Kastrenakes, a former federal prosecutor who has served on the circuit bench in Palm Beach County since 2009. Both were jailed to their families’ surprise. Both cases were in connection to jury duty.
Somerville, who had been selected to serve on a civil jury, was found guilty of direct contempt after he told the judge he had overslept and did not notify anyone about his absence from the trial.
Lattimore reportedly was chosen to be part of a jury pool for a criminal case before Kastrenakes in December 2018. Lattimore allegedly told administrators “he didn’t believe in coming to court,” used an expletive and left the courthouse, according to court documents.
Attorney Daniel Galo, who represented Lattimore, argued, among several things, in a motion for judgment of acquittal, there was “no evidence Mr. Lattimore disobeyed an order of the court to serve as a juror.”
After Kastrenakes found Lattimore guilty March 29, he was remanded to the jail until sentencing the following week. Between his initial arrest and his sentencing, Lattimore served nine days in jail.
Kastrenakes sentenced Lattimore to time served and to three months of probation, which he has completed, according to court records. Though Lattimore had two previous arrests, the judge could not consider those in his sentencing because neither case resulted in a conviction.
“He moved forward, but I don’t think the court was correct,” Galo said in an interview Tuesday.
Kastrenakes sentenced Somerville, who court records show had no previous criminal history, to 10 days in jail and a year of probation. Once he finished his time, he apologized to the judge, and his family spoke on his behalf. Kastrenakes reduced the sentence to three months of probation, and once that was completed, he would remove the conviction from his record.
After “reflection over the weekend,” Kastrenakes vacated and rescinded his finding of contempt of court and the sentence of probation.
“The only reason the Court left him on a short term of probation was so that others could learn and take heed that serving on a jury is serious business deserving of attention, respect and adherence to their oaths,” Kastrenakes wrote in Monday’s order.
Like Kastrenakes, Galo said he believes jury duty is one of the highest forms of civic duty and that everyone should serve. He said sometimes when some cases concerning such issues gain enough attention, they may not get that message across.
“It’s not encouraging people to do jury service when they see someone serving 10 days in jail on the front page of The Palm Beach Post for not coming to jury duty,” he said. “I think it’s getting lost in the message.”
Galo said Lattimore received too harsh a sentence because there wasn’t enough evidence to find him guilty of contempt. As for other cases in general, he said judges may be criticized for certain sentences, but he doesn’t know of an alternative for bringing people back to court.
“The question then becomes: Does the court have to impose jail time to guarantee the process is followed?”
In his order filed Monday, Kastrenakes said because of the “abundant publicity surrounding Mr. Somerville’s case, I have concluded that the importance and seriousness of a sworn juror abiding by the law has been made clear.”
Such national news outlets like The New York Times and BuzzFeed covered Somerville’s story, and public figures such as congresswomen and celebrities expressed outrage at the sentence.
During an episode of “The Daily Show,” host Trevor Noah called the judge’s ruling the “biggest load of (expletive) I’ve seen in a long time.”
“You know racism is bad in America when a black man can get thrown in jail at someone else’s trial,” Noah said.
U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., tweeted, “This judge put a young black man with no prior arrests in the system for *checks notes* oversleeping. We must reform our criminal justice system, which is designed to criminalize people of color.”
U.S. Rep. Frederica Wilson, a Democrat who represents a district near Miami, demanded in a tweet that Kastrenakes step down.
“Judge John Kastrenakes wanted to make an example of Deandre Somerville, 21, and slapped him with a criminal record for missing jury duty. This is an outrageous abuse of power,” she wrote.
Edwin Ferguson, whom Somerville identified as his attorney, said in the last few days he heard from several people about the case. Yes, Somerville should have gone to jury duty, but a jail sentence made no sense, he said.
When people are serving similar sentences for other misdemeanor or felony cases, 10 days for oversleeping jury service doesn’t add up, Ferguson said.
“So many people have said we need equity,” he said Tuesday.
Somerville said he understood the backlash to Kastrenakes’ sentence, but he didn’t “want to throw dirt on him.” Instead, he said he chooses to focus on other things.
“I’m not letting this define who I am or who I turn out to be,” he said.

Texto completo: The Competitive Enterprise Institute has published a new paper, "Wrong Again: 50 Years of Failed Eco-pocalyptic Predictions." Keep in mind that many of the grossly wrong environmentalist predictions were made by respected scientists and government officials. My question for you is: If you were around at the time, how many government restrictions and taxes would you have urged to avoid the predicted calamity?
As reported in The New York Times (Aug. 1969) Stanford University biologist Dr. Paul Ehrlich warned: "The trouble with almost all environmental problems is that by the time we have enough evidence to convince people, you’re dead. We must realize that unless we’re extremely lucky, everybody will disappear in a cloud of blue steam in 20 years."
In 2000, Dr. David Viner, a senior research scientist at University of East Anglia’s climate research unit, predicted that in a few years winter snowfall would become "a very rare and exciting event. Children just aren’t going to know what snow is." In 2004, the U.S. Pentagon warned President George W. Bush that major European cities would be beneath rising seas. Britain will be plunged into a Siberian climate by 2020. In 2008, Al Gore predicted that the polar ice cap would be gone in a mere 10 years. A U.S. Department of Energy study led by the U.S. Navy predicted the Arctic Ocean would experience an ice-free summer by 2016.
In May 2014, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius declared during a joint appearance with Secretary of State John Kerry that "we have 500 days to avoid climate chaos."
Peter Gunter, professor at North Texas State University, predicted in the spring 1970 issue of The Living Wilderness: "Demographers agree almost unanimously on the following grim timetable: by 1975 widespread famines will begin in India; these will spread by 1990 to include all of India, Pakistan, China and the Near East, Africa. By the year 2000, or conceivably sooner, South and Central America will exist under famine conditions. ... By the year 2000, thirty years from now, the entire world, with the exception of Western Europe, North America, and Australia, will be in famine."
Ecologist Kenneth Watt’s 1970 prediction was, "If present trends continue, the world will be about four degrees colder for the global mean temperature in 1990, but eleven degrees colder in the year 2000." He added, "This is about twice what it would take to put us into an Ice Age."
Mark J. Perry, scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and professor of economics and finance at the University of Michigan’s Flint campus, cites 18 spectacularly wrong predictions made around the time of first Earth Day in 1970. This time it’s not about weather. Harrison Brown, a scientist at the National Academy of Sciences, published a chart in Scientific American that looked at metal reserves and estimated that humanity would run out of copper shortly after 2000. Lead, zinc, tin, gold and silver would be gone before 1990. Kenneth Watt said, "By the year 2000, if present trends continue, we will be using up crude oil at such a rate ... that there won’t be any more crude oil."
There were grossly wild predictions well before the first Earth Day, too. In 1939, the U.S. Department of the Interior predicted that American oil supplies would last for only another 13 years. In 1949, the secretary of the interior said the end of U.S. oil supplies was in sight. Having learned nothing from its earlier erroneous energy claims, in 1974, the U.S. Geological Survey said that the U.S. had only a 10-year supply of natural gas. However, the U.S. Energy Information Administration estimated that as of Jan. 1, 2017, there were about 2,459 trillion cubic feet of dry natural gas in the United States. That’s enough to last us for nearly a century. The United States is the largest producer of natural gas worldwide.
Today’s wild predictions about climate doom are likely to be just as true as yesteryear’s. The major difference is today’s Americans are far more gullible and more likely to spend trillions fighting global warming. And the only result is that we’ll be much poorer and less free.

It's flannel season: Here's why the fabric is woven into Vermont's identity

Texto completo: Vermont fall leaves little room for doubt: It's flannel season. Take a walk around the Green Mountain State this time of year and you're sure to see everything from flannel shirts to plaid-patterned scarves.
So how did flannel become so popular here? You might glean some answers by a quick look at the fabric's origins.
According to a history compiled by Gear Patrol, flannel emerged in Wales, where an abundance of sheep provided a wool fabric particularly suited to their climate, which is quite similar to Vermont's — cold and wet.
In the United States, the fabric was used in the Civil War to keep soldiers warm and dry. Flannel earned its blue-collar reputation during the construction of the country's first railroads, when workers wore flannel long-underwear and overalls.
Paul Bunyan gets credit When did flannel become iconic? Some signs point to Paul Bunyan, when fables and folklore about the giant lumberjack were woven into the fabric of American folklore.
According to the Paul Bunyan Scenic Highway Association in Minnesota, pamphlets distributed nationally at the turn of the 20th century by the Red River Lumber Co. were some of the first to depict Bunyan in flannel, solidifying its reputation as the go-to shirt for the outdoor working class.
The flannel cause was furthered by U.S. Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee who, according to the New York Times, famously walked over 1,000 miles across the state in a red-and-black flannel shirt during his gubernatorial campaign.
Then, of course, grunge happened: '90s chart-toppers like Nirvana lead singer Kurt Cobain, Pearl Jam lead singer Eddie Vedder and their bandmates started wearing plaid-patterned flannel on tour.
The style was so popular that it even inspired fashion designer Marc Jacobs, who in 1993 released a collection of grunge-inspired clothing for women, replete with flannel dresses and plaid-patterned shirts (the collection was poorly received and, according to Vogue, got the designer fired from Perry Ellis).
So, why Vermont? So why do Vermonters love flannel so much? In an interview with American Manufacturing, Mark Baker, owner of Vermont Flannel Co., said the style is inextricable from the Green Mountain State.
"It's part of our life up here in Vermont," Baker said in the interview. "It's part of our heritage. Flannel has been part of the landscape of farmers and the people out tapping the maple syrup trees. They wear those flannels. It represents an area that is beautiful and has a lot of hard-working people that know how to survive winters."
Baker said his claim-to-fame is the invention of flannel lounge pants. "I was the first person in the world to make them," Baker said.
If you want to celebrate Vermont's fastidious flannel love, visit Baker's Vermont Flannel Co., a family-operated store that's been in business since 1991. They even have a photo booth where customers can don their new purchase and celebrate the fabric's peak season.
And don't forget to mark Flannel Day on your calendar, celebrated annually by retailers and enthusiasts on Feb. 10.

Texto completo: New York Times bestselling author Tracey Garvis-Graves was one of six speakers who inspired authors and attendees at the 10th annual All-Iowa Writers' Conference at Drake Community Library on Saturday, Sept. 21.
Garvis-Graves shared her experience of self-publishing her first book, On the Island, after being rejected by 14 agents. Her book sold so many copies that it got the attention of Amazon, who included her title in a special promotion. The rest is history as the sales of her first book landed her offers from agents, which led to her current successful publishing career. Her first book is currently in development with MGM for a feature film.
The day opened with an hour-long presentation on police procedure by Grinnell Police Captain Zach Sittig, who shared his experience in law enforcement. He touched on all aspects of being a police officer from talking to making arrests and the use of deadly force.
Marci Bolden, whose latest book, A Life Without Water, talked about her publishing journey and shared tips on publishing a series. She is also the author of the Stonehill Series.
Cheryl Mullenbach, who writes historical non-fiction books, shared tips on searching for historical data and uncovering the unusual stories that aren't found in typical history books. Her books include Double Victory: How African American Women Broke Race and Gender Barriers to Help Win World War II, to Industrial Revolution for Kids, Women in Blue, Great Depression for Kids and Torpedoed, a World War II book about the 1939 sinking of a passenger ship and two children's survival at sea.
Cedar Rapids-based science fiction author, M.L. Williams, a former journalist, spoke and read from his books, Seers of Verde, The Legend Fulfilled, Return of the Earthers: Seers of Verde, Book 2. He also shared from his latest publication, Cornfield Chronicles, a book filled with tales of his growing up days on an Iowa farm.
Mary Lee Ashford, who writes the Sugar and Spice series for Kensington Books, and is one half of the writing team Sparkle Abbey (who has written 10 books in the Pampered Pet series) returned to share her insights and tips into the world of writing. Sparkle Abbey had spoken at the conference twice before and Mary Lee also attended the first All-Iowa writers' conference in 2010. Mary Lee is the founding president of Sisters in Crime-Iowa chapter.
The meal was provided by Dayton Meat Products in Malcom.
The All-Iowa Writers' Conference was founded by J.O. and Debbie Parker, co-owners of Our Front Porch Books in Montezuma. The couple has published three books – two Iowa photography books and one romantic suspense entitled, The Auctioneer. The 2020 writers' conference is slated for Saturday, Sept. 19 at a site to be determined.

Texto completo: Amber Guyger got off easy.
Amber Guyger got what she deserved.
It's easy to be in either camp - or, for the truly ambivalent, to be in both camps at once.
One thing is certain: Botham Jean is dead. Guyger killed him by accident, she says, but at best there appears to be considerable carelessness involved.
Which only brings up the very troubling question: Would she have made that mistake if Jean had not been black and she were not white?
Jean, 26, an accountant and native of St. Lucia, was relaxing after work in his Dallas apartment when Guyger, 30, a Dallas police officer, walked in and shot him.
Guyger, who lived in the same building but on a different floor, told authorities she mistakenly had entered Jean's apartment, thinking it was her own. When she saw Jean, she said, she thought he was an intruder and shot him in the chest.
With that, cue the news networks, the pundits, the politicians and the community activists chanting, "No Justice, No peace!" Put Jean's name alongside Laquan McDonald of Chicago; Walter Scott in North Charleston, South Carolina; Freddie Gray in Baltimore; Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri; and other black men who have died in questionable encounters with police.
But this case also was tougher than those others. There was no controversy connected to Botham's name before his death. He hadn't been stopped by police on the street or driving his car. He was quietly eating ice cream in his own home.
Yet, successful prosecutions of officers are rare, civil libertarians and police brutality specialists say. Guyger's tearful remorse also made her an exceptionally sympathetic figure, perhaps too sympathetic, many reasoned, for the jury to find her guilty of murder instead of, say, knocking the charge down to manslaughter.
She didn't get off that easy, although it could have been worse. Guyger was sentenced to 10 years.
But the drama of Guyger's sentencing was almost upstaged by a surprising display of compassion for her by Brandt Jean, Botham's 18-year-old brother.
"I think giving your life to Christ would be the best thing that Botham would want for you," he said, addressing his victim impact statement toward her. "I love you as a person, and I don't wish anything bad on you."
He told Guyger that he didn't even want her to go to prison. Then he asked for permission to give her a hug. Guyger responded by rushing across the courtroom to join him in a big long hug.
Then the judge, Tammy Kemp, who also is African American, also gave her a hug and a Bible.
The poignant scene coming across national television and computer screens reminded me of the survivors and victims' families of the mass shooting by a white supremacist at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, killing nine and wounding three others in 2015.
Such expressions of forgiveness after the Charleston shooting and in Dallas received a mixed response from black community leaders and citizens. "What white people are really asking for when they demand forgiveness from a traumatized community is absolution," wrote Roxane Gay in The New York Times about why she could not forgive Dylann Roof, the Charleston killer.
"They want absolution from the racism that infects us all even though forgiveness cannot reconcile America's racist sins. They want absolution from their silence in the face of all manner of racism, great and small," she wrote. "I, for one, am done forgiving."
She's not alone. I do not easily forgive killers such as Guyger or Roof, either, unless they show that they understand the errors of their ways and are willing and ready to change themselves for the better.
Guyger, at least, appears ready, but first she must serve her sentence. Forgiveness can help us all to find peace. But there must also be justice.

A LOSING SEASON FOR U.S. FOREIGN POLICY WHY WOULD OTHER NATIONS MAKE A DEAL WITH THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION?

Texto completo: The news that talks between the U.S. and North Korea in Stockholm stalled out, with the North Korean representatives announcing their disinterest in scheduling a forward session, is no surprise. It does, however, mark the failure of what President Donald J. Trump considered to be a potential slam dunk diplomatic success that could have ended with a Nobel Prize.
There are solutions for getting out of this diplomatic stalemate, but there is no reason to think that America's current president could pull that off. For starters, he is erratic. Second, and perhaps more important, his track record does not show him honoring America's agreements..
The first example would be the Paris Agreement on climate change. Given the clear, scientific evidence that climate change is underway, it is both amazing and appalling that the United States, an apparently well-educated and aware country, is not leading the way in addressing this global, life-threatening problem.
The second example is the Iran nuclear deal. The agreement could have tied Iran's hands on its nuclear weapons program, and it would have put pressure on the theocratic government in Tehran to work civilly with other nations. But Mr. Trump reneged on the deal, leaving the other signatories out in the cold.
So why would any nation, including North Korea, make a deal with the Trump administration?
Such a deal would occur, in my opinion, only if the U.S. put something on the table that North Korea wanted. Chief among these would likely be the removal of some, if not all, of the economic sanctions that continue to throttle North Korean development. The rules governing these sanctions are flexible enough that the U.S. could relieve them incrementally. Why not work to ratchet down both U.S. sanctions and North Korean weapons?
This same strategy could bring the U.S. back to the table with Iran. Why not offer to reduce U.S. economic sanctions against Iran in return for tangible evidence that Iran will stop riling unrest in the region? Where is the creativity in U.S. foreign policy?
The issue is that the policies governing U.S. statecraft are as much set by Mr. Trump's early morning tweets as they are by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, whose State Department resembles a Kansas corn maze.
There have been several other notable foreign policy failures of the current U.S. administration. This includes the negotiations with the Taliban regarding the U.S. presence in Afghanistan, talks that sought to end more than 18 years of war. But Mr. Trump pulled the plug on the discussions, apparently over some internal battle within his administration over where he would meet with the Taliban.
In regard to the perennially treacherous Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the idea that Mr. Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner will come up with a creative solution is long gone. U.S. policy in that region has been especially sloppy, as Mr. Trump has used his power to help Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu negotiate his own dicey political battles.
In Syria, it is unclear what impact Mr. Trump's recent decision to withdraw 1,000 U.S. troops from the northern part of the country will have. On one hand, he will be able in the American presidential campaign to say that he brought U.S. troops home from one Middle East war. But on the other, the U.S. has essentially abandoned the Syrian Kurdish troops who were allies fighting alongside us against the Islamic State. Other allies, or future potential allies, will see that as a reason not to line up alongside us in a future conflict.
The decision to sell the Kurds down the river was done almost entirely to appease Turkey, a NATO ally that felt threatened by the Kurdish troops just across the border in Syria. It can be hoped that part of the U.S. agreement to pull out includes a pledge on Turkey's part to exercise restraint in Syria. But given the ruthless nature of the Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the situation should be monitored closely.
The kindest thing that can be said of the Trump administration's activity abroad is that there are currently no new wars. Beyond that, it has been a losing season for U.S. foreign policy.

Republicans have every reason to leak the whistleblower identity, and hopefully they will

Texto completo: It’s an absolute riot to see the Washington Post lend cover for Democrats feigning concern over potential leaks from Congress. Remember, it was congressional Democrats themselves who leaked the biggest story of 2018, and it was none other than the Post that directly benefited from it.
A front-page story in the Post on Tuesday said that Democrats were considering “extraordinary steps” to conceal the identity of a “whistleblower” in order to “prevent President Trump’s congressional allies from exposing the individual.”
The whistleblower is at the center of the Ukraine controversy that’s very boring and convoluted, but which entails Trump earlier this year asking the country’s leader to look into possibly corrupt activity involving former Vice President Joe Biden and his 49-year-old son Hunter.
Trump, understandably, wants to know the whistleblower’s identity so that he can undermine his credibility, which is probably not really necessary given that we already know he’s a career government worker who supports one of the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates (I wonder who).
But since when did the Washington Post start caring about the concerns of anti-leakers? The paper said that Democrats might go so far as to have the whistleblower offer testimony to Congress from a remote location while having any potential identifiers, like his face and voice, obscured. “The efforts reflect Democrats’ deepening distrust of their GOP colleagues,” the report said, “whom they see as fully invested in defending a president who has attacked the whistleblower’s credibility and demanded absolute loyalty from Republicans.”
That’s a very charitable way of saying that Democrats are afraid of what we might find out about the government worker once we learn his name. Mind you, when Republicans show caution about having classified documents shared with their colleagues, that throws the national press into high alert of a cover-up. When Democrats do it, it’s due to their rightful “deepening distrust” of the GOP. And when Republicans defend the head of their party, that’s “absolute loyalty.” When Democrats do it, it’s a sign of strong party unity.
It’s interesting timing for the Post, of all places, to start airing partisan worries about leaks. It was the Post, after all, that published the name of Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who last year accused Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh of attempting to rape her in high school. Ford had said she wanted to remain anonymous, but her claims were first leaked by Democrats to the New York Times and then her identity was revealed by the Post.
Republicans wouldn’t have wanted that leaked, and they even offered Ford the opportunity to give testimony to Congress quietly from her home in California, rather than on national TV in Washington. I don’t recall any Democrats fretting over Ford’s privacy or any national papers giving a platform to Republicans who knew that a leak from Democrats might have just tanked their Supreme Court nominee.
Democrats salivate at the thought of getting every year of Trump’s private tax returns precisely so they can leak potentially embarrassing details contained within them. Any journalist want to write a story about the “extraordinary steps” that the administration is taking to prevent that because of the “deepening distrust” Trump has for Democrats who have shown no reason to trust them? Probably not.
Apparently, not all leaks are created equal.

Trump's enablers

Texto completo: We're all familiar by now with the reasons advanced for why elected Republicans shrivel like dry houseplants whenever they are asked to distance themselves from the president. They fear primary challengers. They dread his Twitter wrath. They like the judges. All true as far as it goes. And we might add that partisanship has reached radioactive levels -- what with the siloing of information sources, the "big sort" in geographical choices, and so forth.
But pause for a moment over the people who work directly for Trump. Why do so few of them quit? The turnover rate in this administration has set records, but with the exception of James Mattis and John Bolton, remarkably few have walked out. (For what it's worth, Trump contends that he fired both Mattis and Bolton.)
After Bolton's departure, Trump crowed that "we have 15 candidates" for national security adviser. "Everyone wants it badly, as you can imagine." And why would that be? Because it's key to keeping America safe? Because it carries great responsibility and opportunities to make the world more stable and secure? No, "It's great because it's a lot of fun to work with Donald Trump." Thus does the job of national security adviser to the president of the United States get transformed into a game show slot.
The truth is that Trump is among the worst bosses in the world. He has tantrums, hurls insults and maintains a level of chaos that makes a Tilt-A-Whirl seem calm. But none of that seems to faze Trump's appointees, who have frequently accepted humiliation at his hands.
This week's New York Times account of Trump's behind-the-scenes fulminations about immigration illustrate the pattern. Dressing down his Homeland Security secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, Trump demanded that she shoot down drones without legal authority. When she pushed back, he sneered: "Kirstjen, you didn't hear me the first time, honey. Shoot 'em down. Sweetheart, just shoot 'em out of the sky, O.K.?"
Bob Woodward's book, "Fear" offers similar examples. He called his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, "mentally retarded. He's this dumb Southerner." After Rudy Giuliani turned in a TV appearance that Trump judged insufficiently sycophantic, he jibed: "Rudy, you're a baby. I've never seen a worse defense of me in my life. They took your diaper off right there. You're like a little baby that needed to be changed. When are you going to be a man?"
He told Wilbur Ross that he didn't trust him to negotiate because "you're past your prime." He called Reince Priebus "weak" and gave him the nickname "Reincy."
If they won't even stand up straight and assert their own dignity, it's not surprising that they shrink from vindicating the honor of the United States and the rule of law. If more of Trump's people had resigned rather than silently assented to a presidency that displayed contempt for law, Trump might not be facing impeachment now.
According to the Times account on immigration policy -- since confirmed by several other news outlets including Fox -- Trump repeatedly called for shutting down the entire U.S./Mexico border; told aides to take the land along the border even without legal authority and promised to pardon them if they got into trouble; suggested filling a moat with snakes and alligators; demanded an electrified fence with spikes; and proposed that migrants who throw rocks be shot. When told that was not possible, he revised it to shooting them in the legs.
The staffers gingerly noted that some of these things were illegal, and then dutifully trotted off to prepare moat cost estimates. Nielsen bleated, "I know you're frustrated."
Again and again, those surrounding Trump have taken to subterfuge (Gary Cohn snatching papers off the Resolute desk), or anonymous New York Times op-eds to proclaim their patriotic role in restraining the wilder impulses of the commander in chief. But they do not protest that this administration is lawless. They don't resign. They don't go public. They wait to be fired and then insulted, and thereby reinforce the president's perception that there are no guardrails.

Texto completo: Amber Guyger got off easy.
Amber Guyger got what she deserved.
It's easy to be in either camp - or, for the truly ambivalent, be in both camps at once.
One thing is certain: Botham Jean is dead. Guyger killed him by accident, she says, but at best there appears to be considerable carelessness involved.
Which only brings up the very troubling question: Would she have made that mistake if Jean had not been black and she were not white?
Jean, 26, an accountant and native of St. Lucia, was relaxing after work in his Dallas apartment when Guyger, 30, a Dallas police officer, walked in and shot him.
Guyger, who lived in the same building but on a different floor, told authorities she mistakenly had entered Jean's apartment, thinking it was her own. When she saw Jean, she said, she thought he was an intruder and shot him in the chest.
The story quickly went viral on national news and the web, partly because of the tantalizing racial angle.
With that, cue the news networks, the pundits, the politicians and the community activists chanting, "No Justice, No peace!" Put Jean's name alongside Laquan McDonald of Chicago; Walter Scott in North Charleston, S.C.; Freddie Gray in Baltimore; Michael Brown in Ferguson, Miss. and other black men who have died in questionable encounters with police.
But this case also was tougher than those others. There was no controversy connected to Botham's name before his death. He hadn't been stopped by police on the street or driving his car. He was quietly eating ice cream in his own home.
Yet, successful prosecutions of police officers are rare, civil libertarians and police brutality specialists say. Guyger's tearful remorse also made her an exceptionally sympathetic figure.
Jurors also were allowed to consider her Castle Doctrine defense, which allows homeowners in some states, including Texas, to stand their ground and shoot intruders - even though in this case the "castle" turned out to be somebody else's home.
She didn't get off that easy, although it could have been worse. Guyger was sentenced to 10 years, eligible for parole after five.
The average sentence for an on-duty officer convicted of murder is about 12 years, Philip Stinson, a legal expert on police shootings, told The Dallas Morning News.
But the drama of Guyger's sentencing was almost upstaged by a surprising display of compassion for her by Brandt Jean, Botham's 18-year-old brother.
"I think giving your life to Christ would be the best thing that Botham would want for you," he said, addressing his victim impact statement toward her. "I love you as a person and I don't wish anything bad on you."
The poignant scene reminded me of the survivors and victims' families of the mass shooting by a white supremacist at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C. in 2015.
Such expressions of forgiveness after the Charleston shooting and in Dallas received a mixed response from black community leaders and citizens.
"What white people are really asking for when they demand forgiveness from a traumatized community is absolution," wrote Roxane Gay in The New York Times about why she could not forgive Dylan Roof, the Charleston killer.
She's not alone. I do not easily forgive killers such as Guyger or Roof, either, unless they show that they understand the errors of their ways and are willing and ready to change themselves for the better. Guyger, at least, appears ready, but first she must serve her sentence. Forgiveness can help us all to find peace. But there must also be justice.

Texto completo: Samin Nosrat's laugh is delightful and infectious. It's the kind of warm uninhibited chorus that makes you feel not only like you've known the New York Times best-selling author for years, but also that she couldn't be more happy to talk with you today.
This charming, approachable persona is an undeniable part of the reason why Nostrat's Netflix series "Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat" — inspired by her James Beard Award-winning book of the same name — has been hailed for changing the food show landscape forever.
In the four-part series, viewers see Nosrat lose herself in the pleasure of a piece of aged Parmesan cheese, giggle as her eyes water while chopping onions and do an adorable happy dance with a friend as they devour a dish while standing around the kitchen counter.
It's a show that's as much about food, where it comes from and how to make it, as it is about watching someone simply enjoy it.
The show premiered on the streaming platform almost a year ago, and Nosrat's been busy in the intervening months. She's already begun work on a second series and thinking about her next book, "What to Cook."
She's also hitting the road, crisscrossing the country for evening events during which she chats with local hosts about food, cooking and anything else that might come up when she fields questions from the audience.
We chatted with the author, TV star and chef about what fans can expect.
Question: So, what can people expect from this tour?
Answer: We basically laugh a lot (laughs) and then, I mean, each conversation is different, which is something I really love about it.
One thing I'm really excited about that is that I edited this year's edition of "Best American Food Writing." I was pretty riled up when I was doing the editing and writing the forward but what I'm excited about is I think it will rile people up when they read it. I did my best to highlight all sorts of different issues beyond what we just consider to be food and I'm really excited to get to talk about the wonderful diversity of the writing.
The other thing I'm thinking so much about is climate change and how food affects and is affected by it.
I have been reading a lot about climate change and agriculture and food and I feel like — and I'm so hesitant to say this, but I gotta start saying it somewhere — I feel like the only responsible thing for me to do is become a daytime vegan. And I really don't want to. Like I really don't want to but I feel like it's something I have to do and I feel like it's what I need to, not necessarily bully other people into doing, but at least model for people. Changing out diets is the single most powerful thing we as individuals can do.
It's both depressing and exciting. (laughs)
Why getting a show was a 'whiplash moment' Q: It sounds like you maybe have been thinking about using your platform to be an activist? Or raise awareness, maybe?
A: I wouldn't use the word "activist." I still do have a relationship with the New York Times so I have not fully jumped into activism. But I do think education and awareness is really important and it's my job.
I found out that Netflix was interested in the show two days after the 2016 election and it was a really hard time for me. I really felt that that election said to me, personally, that people who look like you are not wanted here. So I was sort of sitting with the grief of that and then found out this thing two days later.
It was a really whiplash moment for me and I took it really seriously and thought really carefully about whether I wanted to put myself in the public eye when the public had made it clear that people who look like me or are from the part of the world that my family is from are not necessarily considered American or welcome here.
I did in the end decide that I did want to do it and I was like, OK if I am going to do this then I'm going to use it to promote the kind of message that's really important to me, which is one of unity and sharing with people my ultimate belief that we are more similar than different across the world.
So I don't know that I would use the word "activist" necessarily, but I do think that there are so many things in our daily lives that feel really overwhelming. Changing a habit is really hard. I get how hard it is. I have my own really conflicted decisions about changing the way I eat and yet my brain understands that it's what we all have to do. Or it's what I have to do at least.
What being 'daytime vegan' means Q: But vegan? I don't know if I could give up cheese...
A: Well, the thing is it's daytime vegan (laughs)
Q: So, only when the sun is up?
A: Totally. Basically, statistically, if you give up animal products for two of your meals, you end up using less carbon than if you're a full-time vegetarian. I think if I fully had to give up cheese and dairy and butter it would just be like, I couldn't. I would die.
One of the books I've been reading is by my friend Jonathan Safran Foer. He has a new climate change book coming out, and he proposes this and his whole book is about his own personal difficulty with it and also the understanding that if you don't do it, you're just a person who didn't do something when the moment required it.
Q: I know you're working on another book. Can you share anything about what people can expect in "What to Cook"?
A: Yeah! I mean to be completely honest I have not actually started working on it because I am going to make another TV series first. I'm in the sort of development part, which is like the brainstorm part of the show, so that's been taking up most of my mental energy.
How her new book will be different from 'Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat' But as far as the book, one of things I've seen is that people feel kind of stuck about deciding what to make.
Even really good home cooks create a menu for a dinner or a party page for page, word for word out of a magazine spread of recipes. Or because they saw such-and-such-thing on TV or Instagram. I started to think about how there's so much I can share with those people about how to make their lives easier by understanding what decisions to make about what they should be cooking.
I did my best with "Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat" to teach people how to translate how professional cooks think about how to cook. What I've realized is I haven't really that similar translation about how professional cooks decide what to cook.
I think people have a really romantic notion that chefs show up at work and are like 'today I feel like making this grand and wonderful creation' or something. And maybe some people do that. But the constraints of a real kitchen are what chiefly make a professional cook decide what to make. If I can teach that to home cooks I think it would make people's day-to-day cooking a lot easier.
So that's what I'm going to do with the book that I have not started writing yet. (laughs)
Chef Samin Nosrat is the author of the award-winning book, "Salt Fat Acid Heat: Mastering the Elements of Good Cooking," which is now a show on Netflix.

'Natural Born's' killer reputation; Oliver Stone and star Juliette Lewis say the '94 film reflected, not caused, U.S. violence.

Texto completo: It's been 25 years since Oliver Stone's "Natural Born Killers" caused a stir when it hit theaters, but the violent tale of lovers-on-the-run mixed with a vicious media satire still feels controversial today.
In celebration of the flamboyantly over-the-top film's anniversary, it's closing out this year's edition of L.A.'s Beyond Fest Tuesday night followed by a Q&A with filmmaker Stone, stars Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis and producer Don Murphy.
In the movie Harrelson and Lewis play Mickey and Mallory Knox, a young couple who embark on a wild crime spree that winds up making them the center of a worldwide media storm. The film's outrageous style, mixing film formats with a high-density editing strategy, made it visceral and shocking.

As Times critic Kenneth Turan put in his original review, the film is "both audacious and astonishing, a vision of a charnel house apocalypse that comes close to defying description." Turan also called it, "the movie Oliver Stone was born to make, and if that statement is a knife that cuts both ways, so be it."
Much as with the recent concern around real-world violence and the release of Warner Bros.' "Joker," there was much consternation in the media that "Natural Born Killers" would set off copycat crimes. A lawsuit essentially attempting to treat the movie as a faulty product, claiming that Stone and Warner Brothers were responsible for a young couple's multi-state crime spree, dragged on in the courts for years before eventually being dismissed.
Among the many sources of intrigue surrounding the movie, the film's original script was written by Quentin Tarantino -- he ultimately received a story credit on the finished film -- before being rewritten by Stone, Richard Rutowski and David Veloz. In a small irony, "Natural Born Killers" cinematographer Robert Richardson has shot Tarantino's last few projects, including this year's "Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood."
Stone and Lewis recently spoke separately about the movie ahead of the Beyond Fest event.
"I think it was a special movie," said Stone. "There's nothing quite like it. It's one of a kind."
--
Where did the style of the movie come from, mixing formats and with the extreme editing style? Did it feel like an extension of what you had already been doing on "JFK" and some of your other films?
Oliver Stone: We always tried to adapt the style to the subject matter. The reason for "Natural Born Killers" being so extreme was because of the time that it was made, in the early '90s, seemed to me a time of excess and a new change in the cultural environment, in the sense of sensationalism and violence promoted by the major media in a way that has never been done before. ... The news was becoming oriented toward the sensational, whether it be violence or the growth to a war, the constant beat of the drum to create a tabloid headline. Staid old papers started to change, a woman would cut off her husband's penis and that would make the front page of the New York Times or the Washington Post.
I think from about '92, '93, '94, it started to get really heavy and it never stopped. And I thought, "This is not a good thing that's happening, but this is happening." And it hasn't stopped. I see too much of that mentality around now. Television for example, commercials have adopted the mentality of "Natural Born Killers": shock, shock, shock. One after the other. You can't surprise the audience. There's no sense of formality or slowing down or keeping an atmosphere. It's more and more: Get out front, get your attention, don't let it go. That's what that movie was about.
--
You've all always talked about the movie as a satire or critique of the media, but it so often was received as being some kind of treatise on screen violence. Why do you think there was that disconnect?
Stone: You'd need to go to psychology classes for that. America is very literal. Violence, literal. I mean I'm a guy who was in Vietnam, I did combat films that were called very realistic, "Born on the Fourth of July," "Platoon," "Salvador." And then how can you believe that [in "Natural Born Killers"] the bullets could do this or a knife could go through a window? This is ridiculous. Can't you see it's tongue in cheek, can't you see we're making fun of it? They couldn't.
Juliette Lewis: Oliver never makes something that says one thing. I mean, [the film] is insanely intelligent and layered. So that combination I knew was going to be really interesting and provocative. But here's what was wild: When me and Woody did the press -- and by the way, I was new to press junkets, I wasn't that versed -- I never felt so much disdain and animosity expressed to us actors from journalists. I mean, those interviews, they hated us. They hated the movie. And then you look at it in hindsight, you go, that's Oliver Stone antagonizing, prodding.
--
Does the movie still have something to say to us now?
Stone: Younger people still do tell me that. People say it's on the pulse of now. I mean, one of the lines in the movie is, "The future is murder." That's one of three Leonard Cohen songs that we used. It seems like a war mentality and violent mentality is in the air. Americans now -- how many bombing missions do we run? How many remote wars do we fight? Doesn't it come home to roost? That's the whole point of it. There's violence in our system, there's bloodshed in our bloodstream and it's not expected to come home in America.
Lewis: If I'm being honest, as an actor I developed and got to play and do all these improvised things and had my ideas encouraged. But the outcome, I didn't know what to think about the movie actually. The animosity that I was faced with, particularly being a female, the wild one, the sociopath as a female, I think that messes with people. Like I talked with Woody, he didn't get labeled crazy for years to come.
So as far as the themes of what "Natural Born Killers" was posing and making a statement on, absolutely they are as relevant today as they were. I felt like the movie was actually ahead of its time. One of those you catch up to. And that's what's amazing about an Oliver Stone, about radical thinkers, society has to catch up to what he was posing at the time.
--
With the new film "Joker," also a Warner Brothers release, there has been a lot of concern as to whether that film will incite violence. Are you surprised that that's a conversation we're still having?
Stone: Not at all. I think it also applies to the fact that Trump resembles the Joker, so they're making that allusion.
--
But in particular with our current moment, with the rash of mass shootings and the air of violence in the culture, does that give you any pause?
Stone: Why don't we blame it on our Pentagon and all of our military budget and the trillion dollars that we invest in all the wars and occupying the whole planet and inciting people to fight, fight, fight on our televisions? That's what you should blame, the mentality of violence in the air. How is a movie going to kick off this kind of violence? You're most likely to see some kind of shooting, some kind of episodic TV cops show, murder story. Bad guy gets killed, the good guy wins. The usual fiction.
--
At the end of the movie, Mickey and Mallory escape. Do you think that's part of what people found disturbing, that they get away and the end credits shows them having kids and just living their lives?
Stone: Yes, they go on and they become parents and all that ... they become underground people. I guess they end up like hippies.
Some people found it disturbing that they get away with it, because we have a law-and-order mentality. We believe that if we throw a person in prison or shoot them or kill them it's the best way to a solution. It's not the solution.
Lewis: I'm a moral person where you want consequences, but it's also not always the life we live in. I don't know that their kind lives on. I just know Oliver likes to upset people and not give you closure. Do they get away? I don't know. I don't think so. I think they die in a burning house.

What Happened To Giuliani?

Texto completo: The man I worked for in 1993 is not the man who now lies for Donald Trump.
On Oct. 8, 1994, my wife Liz Bruder and I were married in City Hall by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. For 25 years, I carried a wallet-size photo of the three of us from that day.
Liz and I met working on Mr. Giuliani's 1993 mayoral campaign. She was the campaign's deputy finance director and I was the spokesman. Our small paid staff and hundreds of volunteers worked tirelessly to elect Rudy after he had narrowly lost to the incumbent, David Dinkins, in 1989.
Rudy told The New Yorker in January that he doesn't think about his legacy, but is afraid that "Rudy Giuliani: He lied for Trump" will be on his gravestone. "Somehow, I don't think that will be it," he said. "But, if it is, so what do I care? I'll be dead."
He may not care, but anyone who worked on his winning campaigns in 1993 and 1997 or in City Hall during his two terms as mayor does care about his legacy -- and theirs. We were proud to live and work in the clean, safe, prosperous city that Rudy ran and that Mayor Michael Bloomberg inherited from him.
"America's Mayor," as Rudy was called after Sept. 11, is today President Trump's bumbling personal lawyer and henchman, his apologist and defender of the indefensible.
Friends and family constantly ask me, "Has he lost it? Is he crazy? How could you work for a guy like that?" At a recent dinner party, a stranger suggested that I'm not legally married because Rudy, a three-time loser at marriage, officiated our wedding.
He wasn't always like this.
I was a partner in a successful consulting firm, fed up with living in a dangerous, dirty city when I went to work on Rudy's nascent 1993 mayoral campaign. On Dec. 10, 1992, I watched Citizen Rudy heroically race into the Church of St. Agnes on East 43rd Street when a fire broke out. He emerged leading the parishioners and carrying the chalice, his suit jacket covered in soot. That was the Rudy I admired.
My work with Rudy peaked on Election Day, 1993, when his two-point victory over Mayor Dinkins reversed a two-point loss in 1989. After celebrating with Rudy, his family, friends and our campaign team, I slept on the floor of his Hilton Hotel suite. The next morning, I accompanied him downstairs to shoot his scene for a "Seinfeld" episode on nonfat yogurt. The following day, I left for a private sector communications job.
Last year, I declared my continuing respect for Rudy in an op-ed essay in The New York Daily News. I argued that his unwavering defense of the president reflected his instinctive hardball personality -- and that playing hardball required guts and conviction. "Even if they could, most people wouldn't change who they are, particularly if their personalities had made them successful in life," I wrote. "Rudolph William Louis Giuliani is no different."
But in truth, Rudy had already begun to turn me off.
On Oct. 9, 2016, he appeared as candidate Trump's lone campaign surrogate on the Sunday morning political programs to enthusiastically defend Mr. Trump's infantile 2005 Access Hollywood interview as "locker room talk." He said, "Men at times talk like that." I said to myself, "No, Rudy, we don't."
Fast forward to Rudy's Ukraine misadventure. This is not Rudy vigorously defending Mr. Trump's bad behavior. This is Rudy, as a private citizen and personal attorney for the president, lamely acting as a shadow secretary of state and Trump enforcer by attempting to influence the 2020 election in favor of his client.
I've remained in regular contact with my campaign colleagues, many of whom served in senior-level positions in the Giuliani administration. We've talked about his successes and his failures: reducing crime, improving the quality of life and reforming welfare as mayor; his prostate cancer and aborted Senate run against Hillary Clinton; his failed presidential bid and his widely hailed performance on and after Sept. 11.
Now the Ukraine story has us burning up the phone lines. Even former "Yes Rudys" have begun to question their blind fealty to him.
"If Rudy doesn't get a lawyer, he's crazier than I thought," a 1993 campaign colleague and high-ranking Giuliani administration official said when the Ukraine scandal broke. A former senior adviser called him "crazy." Those closest to him beg him to stop talking.
Some longtime Giuliani intimates point to the death on July 7, 2016 of his longtime best friend and political adviser, Peter Powers, as the moment that Rudy lost his way. Others cite Rudy's marriage in 2003 to Judith Nathan, his soon-to-be third ex-wife, as transformational. Rudy was a pizza and Diet Coke guy when I met him in 1992. But he became an Upper East Side and Hamptons socialite and, worse yet, a Palm Beach neighbor of Donald Trump.
After his mayoralty ended in 2002, Rudy went to work for what seemed like every rich bad guy and tinpot dictator who called. (So going to work for Mr. Trump made sense.) He charged $ 100,000 for self-aggrandizing speeches about his heroic leadership after Sept. 11. He became a multimillionaire.
In perfect political symmetry, Rudy Giuliani now does Donald Trump's dirty work: Vainly trying to cover up the Ukrainian cover-up and attacking a Democratic presidential front-runner, Joe Biden, and his son, Hunter.
Watching and reading Rudy's ferocious lying for Mr. Trump, whether on Fox or CNN, forced me to re-examine his last 25 years, especially the profiteering from Sept. 11. But Ukraine was the coup de grâce. We who admired him for so long expected much more from Rudy Giuliani and his legacy.
That wedding photograph with Rudy? I took it out of my wallet recently and put it in a drawer, probably forever.

Texto completo: Tuesday’s forecast for Shanghai is not terribly different from Los Angeles weather: sunny, low-70s, little chance of rain.
But even as the Lakers boarded a flight Monday morning bound for China, they knew they were about to fly into a storm.
Sunday’s news cycle was bombarded by reaction to a Friday tweet from Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey: “Fight For Freedom. Stand With Hong Kong.” The NBA is generally a league that is permissive about expressing personal views on social issues; the estimated hundreds of millions of NBA fans in China are apparently not. Subsequent fallout included Chinese businesses vowing to cut ties with the Rockets, former Houston star Yao Ming saying the Chinese Basketball Association would no longer work with them, and awkwardly worded statements from Rockets ownership and the NBA at large.
In the middle of the madness, the Lakers are flying to Shanghai and Shenzhen, two of the largest cities in the world for a pair of exhibition games with the Brooklyn Nets and a host of league events. What was initially planned as an innocent bit of diplomacy for a league that is extremely popular overseas could now have significantly higher stakes for both the Lakers and the NBA.
Outside of North America, it’s reasonable to say that China is by far the most important market for the NBA. The country of 1.4 billion people is basketball-crazed. According to numbers shared by the league: The CBA estimates that 300 million people play basketball at some level in the country. The NBA has had a dedicated office in China since 2008. Tencent, the league’s top media partner in China, estimates that nearly half a billion people watched NBA programming on their platforms – a figure that has tripled from the viewership just five years ago. It’s common to see Chinese-language reporters roaming locker rooms before and after games, and ESPN has a partnership with Tencent to get one-on-one postgame interviews with players as they walk off the court.
Many players understand the power of the Chinese market, and it’s common for players to tour Chinese cities for their shoe companies. LeBron James, for example, goes abroad virtually every summer.
“I’ve been able to go over there and I’ve always been welcomed with open arms,” he said last week. “They love the game of basketball. It started with Yao and Yi (Jianlian) and those guys over there. We want to make the game as popular as we can and show our appreciation by going overseas in China like we’re doing next week.”
While Chinese fans have a raucous following for both superstars and a handful of major franchises – of which the Lakers are definitely one – they showcase love for players at all levels. Lance Stephenson, who played for the Lakers last year before deciding to play in China this season, recently shared a video on Instagram of the doorman at his hotel mimicking his famous “air guitar” gesture.
Joe Young, who spent Summer League playing for the Lakers, played for Nanjing’s CBA team last season. When he first flew in, he remembers being greeted by hundreds – perhaps even a thousand – fans all bearing roses for him, a foreign player who went on to average 36 points per game for a franchise that hung around the bottom of the league standings. Toward the end of the season, Young didn’t like leaving his apartment for fear that he would be accosted in public by adoring fans.
“It’s just another level over there,” he said. “Those fans are crazy.”
But in light of the Morey incident, it seems that devotion has an uglier side to it: a hair-trigger for rebuking political discourse that puts China in an unfavorable light.
Morey’s tweet touched on a nerve that has been sensitive for months. Hong Kong is in the midst of protests of mainland China’s attempts to assert more control over the island that was a longtime British territory. A bill that would have allowed for extradition to mainland China sparked more than a million people to take to the streets in June to show their displeasure. Since, protesters and the Chinese government have had countless skirmishes, in which the New York Times estimated that some 2,000 canisters of tear canisters had been fired. Complicating the issue, many mainlanders feel that the legacy of Hong Kong is irrevocably tied to the country’s adversarial history with colonialism – Brooklyn Nets owner Joe Tsai tried to relate the context in a Facebook post on Sunday night.
Morey’s tweet was deleted shortly after it was issued, but it was out in the open for the world to notice. Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta quickly noted that Morey’s tweet didn’t represent the Rockets, insisting that the team is an apolitical organization. Morey himself issued a statement saying he did not mean to offend Chinese fans. The NBA followed up with a statement that both related that the league supports individuals “educating themselves and sharing their views,” but also called the incident “regrettable.” James Harden, the Rockets’ franchise star, apologized and added “We love China.”
Outside of the league, the clamor was even louder as several political leaders criticized the NBA for kowtowing to Chinese interests – Republican Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri even wrote an open letter to the NBA asking them to cancel the Lakers’ exhibitions there.
On other hot-button issues, the NBA has stood unconditionally behind its players’ ability to express political views. On his own, James has spoken in support of the Black Lives Matter movement, for gun legislation and against NCAA amateurism. Other politically outspoken NBA figures include coaches Gregg Popovich and Steve Kerr, who have been particularly critical of the White House. Political expression has now entered the fabric of the NBA, so it’s all the more evident when the league tiptoes around a statement such as Morey’s that threatens its standing in a lucrative market.
The conflict of economic interests and political motivations is a needle the league has managed to thread for more than a decade of its increased investment in the Chinese market. This moment is arguably the first serious threat to the harmony that the NBA and China have managed to maintain. The Lakers, who sport two enormously popular stars in James and Anthony Davis, have a chance to heal some of the damage done.
Still, the larger question is likely to linger: Was it reasonable in the first place for the NBA to expect to have it both ways? That might not be so easily resolved.

Texto completo: You may, if you are old enough, recall a TV actor named Foster Brooks.
He was a guest star on such classics of boomer kitsch as "The Monkees," "The Munsters" and "The Mod Squad." But if you do remember him, it's likely for one thing only: his imitation of inebriation. Brooks made his slurring, stammering "funny drunk act" a TV staple, back when drunks were still considered, well  funny.
To recall his career is to marvel at what a difference a generation or two makes.
That era produced another TV trope that, in hindsight, seems equally bizarre: the funny sexual harasser. A hundred times, you saw it: the lecherous boss chasing the nubile secretary around the desk. A hundred times, it didn't register as anything but a joke.
And again, the memory makes you marvel at how the times, they have changed.
In their new book, "She Said," Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, the New York Times reporters who broke the Harvey Weinstein sexual harassment story, remind us that early October contains three anniversaries, each a milestone of the progress we have - and have not - made in learning to take sexual assault seriously.
Oct. 7, 2016: The Washington Post releases the now-infamous "Access Hollywood" video where presidential candidate Donald Trump brags about sexually assaulting women. "And when you're a star, they let you do it," he says. "Grab them by the ... You can do anything."
Oct. 5, 2018: The Senate advances the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court despite a credible allegation that, as a drunken teenager, he attempted to rape a then-classmate, research psychologist Christine Blasey Ford.
Between those two dates - Oct. 5, 2017 - the Times published its report on the film producer Weinstein and his alleged assaults on women in his professional circle, including the actress Ashley Judd. Later, Gwyneth Paltrow and Annabella Sciorra would also number themselves among the accusers.
The story opened a floodgate. By the time the wave of accusations crested, it had splashed dozens of famous men: Matt Lauer, Charlie Rose, Mario Batali, Louis C.K., George H.W. Bush and Al Franken among them. Once-silent women found their voices under a hashtag - #MeToo.
"She Said" recounts the journalistic detective work that led to the breakthrough. It's a compelling story that leaves one pleased to see the good guys - the good "gals," really - get a win. But let us be clear on the limitations of that win. Indeed, the convergence of those anniversaries speaks eloquently to America's ongoing irresolution on matters of sexual harassment and assault. Sure, Weinstein is facing charges, but Kavanaugh went to the Supreme Court, and Trump to the White House.
Still, the story Twohey and Kantor broke changed gender politics. Predictably, there came a backlash, increasing numbers of male managers reportedly refusing to mentor female subordinates. That would seem to open them to civil sanctions. It will be fun to watch one of them try to defend his sexism in court, perhaps before a judge with lady parts.
Elsewhere, folks just want to know, where is the line? Is it allowed to tell a co-worker you find her attractive? Can you share - or laugh at - a bawdy joke? "So much was suddenly open to question," write Kantor and Twohey.
And it is. And that is surely frustrating and difficult.
On the other hand, some of us remember when the boss chased the secretary while the laugh track howled. We thought nothing of it. Now people are wondering "What's acceptable?"
Maybe that's not the worst thing in the world.

Impeachment will fail 'with me as majority leader,' McConnell says

Texto completo: Last week, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said his chamber would have "no choice" but to hold a trial on whether to remove President Donald Trump from office if the House votes to impeach.
But in a new campaign ad on Facebook, the Kentucky Republican makes clear that any impeachment attempt will fail as long as he remains in charge of the Senate.
"Nancy Pelosi's in the clutches of a left-wing mob. They finally convinced her to impeach the president," McConnell says directly to the camera in a 17-second video.
"All of you know your Constitution. The way that impeachment stops is a Senate majority with me as majority leader.
"But I need your help," he adds, standing in front of a picture of an elephant. "Please contribute before the deadline."
The McConnell campaign, according to Facebook's "Ad Library," started running the digital ad Sept. 30, a few days after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced an impeachment inquiry over whether Trump improperly pressured Ukraine's president to investigate political rival and possible 2020 opponent Joe Biden.
The ad features the same video, but McConnell's team has paired the video with different captions that all are mostly focused on the topic of impeachment.
"Your conservative Senate Majority is the ONLY thing stopping Nancy Pelosi from impeaching President Trump. Donate & help us keep it!" one caption reads.
McConnell campaign manager Kevin Golden told The Courier Journal the impeachment inquiry is energizing the Senate leader's supporters.
"Few issues energize conservative voters like liberal overreach," Golden said in a statement. "And the Democrats latest outrageous attempt to impeach President Trump has activated our base to new heights."
Another caption from Team Mitch goes after Pelosi's fellow California Democrat, Rep. Adam Schiff, who chairs the House Intelligence Committee.
"BREAKING: Adam Schiff LIED. His office secretly coordinated with the source of this laughable impeachment inquiry," the caption reads. "Help me stop it."
That caption appears to reference The New York Times' reporting that Schiff received an early account of the whistleblower's complaint regarding Trump's phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
The complaint from the anonymous whistleblower, reportedly a CIA officer, led to the White House releasing a summary of the July phone call between Trump and Zelensky.
According to the call's summary, Trump told Zelensky to reopen an investigation into a Ukrainian energy company connected to Biden's son, Hunter.
McConnell reportedly told the White House to release the transcript of the phone call, something that McConnell and his spokespeople have not commented on.
On Thursday, Trump added further fuel to the fire by telling reporters that China should also investigate the Bidens.
The president also claimed Thursday that McConnell put out a statement referring to the president's phone call with the president of Ukraine as "the most innocent phone call (transcript) that I've read."
McConnell's office has not responded to questions about Trump's assertion, though the Senate leader dismissed criticism of the call and said it is "laughable to think this is anywhere close to an impeachable offense."
On the Senate floor, McConnell has defended his record of standing up for Ukraine, especially against the Russian government.
Democrats and some Republican critics of Trump have said the president's requests to Ukraine and China are a blatant attempt to have a foreign power interfere with next year's election.
Trump has denied any wrongdoing.
It would take a simple majority of the House (218 votes) to submit articles of impeachment to the Senate.
A trial would then be held in the Senate, where it would take at least two-thirds (or 67 votes) of the chamber to convict Trump and remove him from office.
The chief justice of the Supreme Court presides over the trial. But as majority leader, McConnell would have some power in setting up ground rules for a trial, including timing.
"So I would have no choice but to take it up," McConnell told CNBC last week, referring to the impeachment trial. "How long you're on it is a whole different matter."
The new campaign ad from McConnell shows the Senate leader sees the impeachment matter as a chance to raise funds for his 2020 reelection campaign.
Amy McGrath, a former Marine Corps pilot and one of several Democrats in Kentucky vying to unseat McConnell in 2020, endorsed the impeachment inquiry last week.
McGrath has also urged McConnell to show "patriotic courage" and get to the truth of the allegations in the whistleblower complaint.
The "deadline" mentioned by McConnell in the new video refers to Sept. 30, which was the third-quarter cutoff for donations to Senate, House and presidential candidates.
Candidates now have until Oct. 15 to file reports with the Federal Election Commission that reveal their fundraising and spending totals.
According to Facebook's Ad Library, McConnell's campaign spent a little over $63,000 on digital ads between Sept. 27 and Oct. 3.
That represents about 44% of the roughly $143,500 that Facebook data shows Team Mitch spent from May 2018 to Oct. 3, a decent-sized sum in a brief amount of time.
According to the most recent FEC data, McConnell had a sizable war chest for his 2020 reelection bid, with nearly $7.9 million in cash on hand.

Flannel is woven into Vermont's identity

Texto completo: "It represents an area that is beautiful and has a lot
of hard-working people that know how to survive winters."
Mark Baker Owner of Vermont Flannel Co.,
in an interview with American Manufacturing
Vermont fall leaves little room for doubt: It's flannel season. Take a walk around the Green Mountain State this time of year and you're sure to see everything from flannel shirts to plaid-patterned scarves.
So how did flannel become so popular here? You might glean some answers by a quick look at the fabric's origins.
According to a history compiled by Gear Patrol, flannel emerged in Wales, where an abundance of sheep provided a wool fabric particularly suited to their climate, which is quite similar to Vermont's — cold and wet.
In the United States, the fabric was used in the Civil War to keep soldiers warm and dry. Flannel earned its blue-collar reputation during the construction of the country's first railroads, when workers wore flannel long-underwear and overalls.
Paul Bunyan gets credit When did flannel become iconic? Some signs point to Paul Bunyan, when fables and folklore about the giant lumberjack were woven into the fabric of American folklore.
According to the Paul Bunyan Scenic Highway Association in Minnesota, pamphlets distributed nationally at the turn of the 20th century by the Red River Lumber Co. were some of the first to depict Bunyan in flannel, solidifying its reputation as the go-to shirt for the outdoor working class.
The flannel cause was furthered by U.S. Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee who, according to The New York Times, famously walked over 1,000 miles across the state in a red-and-black flannel shirt during his gubernatorial campaign.
Then, of course, grunge happened: '90s chart-toppers like Nirvana lead singer Kurt Cobain, Pearl Jam lead singer Eddie Vedder and their bandmates started wearing plaid-patterned flannel on tour.
The style was so popular that it even inspired fashion designer Marc Jacobs, who in 1993 released a collection of grunge-inspired clothing for women, replete with flannel dresses and plaid-patterned shirts (the collection was poorly received and, according to Vogue, got the designer fired from Perry Ellis).
So, why Vermont? So why do Vermonters love flannel so much? In an interview with American Manufacturing, Mark Baker, owner of Vermont Flannel Co., said the style is inextricable from the Green Mountain State.
"It's part of our life up here in Vermont," Baker said in the interview. "It's part of our heritage. Flannel has been part of the landscape of farmers and the people out tapping the maple syrup trees. They wear those flannels. It represents an area that is beautiful and has a lot of hard-working people that know how to survive winters."
Baker said his claim-to-fame is the invention of flannel lounge pants. "I was the first person in the world to make them," Baker said.
If you want to celebrate Vermont's fastidious flannel love, visit Baker's Vermont Flannel Co., a family-operated store that's been in business since 1991.
They even have a photo booth where customers can don their new purchase and celebrate the fabric's peak season.
And don't forget to mark Flannel Day on your calendar, celebrated annually by retailers and enthusiasts on Feb. 10.

Texto completo: Trees are some of our best allies in solving the climate crisis.
Across North America, trees stand ready to help us solve the climate crisis. Trees remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store it in their wood. One way to respond to a challenge from the United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, to seek "bold action and much greater ambition" on climate change is to protect forests from development, improve forest management and use sustainably harvested wood to build tall buildings. This will allow us to pump carbon from the atmosphere and store it both in forests and in cities. It will also support rural economies, improve wildlife habitat and create more affordable housing.
This opportunity arises from cross-laminated timber, or CLT. First introduced in the 1990s, it enables architects and engineers to design tall, fire-safe and beautiful wood buildings. Recent examples in the United States include the seven-story T3 building in Minneapolis, the eight-story Carbon12 building in Portland, Ore., and a six-story dormitory at Rhode Island School of Design in Providence. In Canada, Norway, Sweden, England and Australia, even taller wooden buildings are already in use. The Mjosa tower in Brumunddal, Norway, is only 25 feet shorter than the Statue of Liberty.
Private industry is gearing up to provide engineered wood for more tall wood buildings here in the United States. This year a highly automated, large CLT plant opened in Washington state. Last week, the first ever CLT plant in New England was announced in Maine.
The energy embodied in the materials for new buildings around the world -- mostly steel and concrete -- accounts for 11 percent of global carbon emissions. Typically, coal is used to heat these materials to temperatures over 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit in the manufacturing process.
Wood, in contrast, is forged from sunlight. A study by scientists from Yale University and the University of Washington showed that expanding wood construction while limiting global harvesting to no more than the annual growth could produce a combination of emissions reduction and carbon sequestration equivalent to eliminating construction emissions altogether. This could take a big bite out of the carbon problem, roughly equivalent to the present contribution from all types of renewable energy.
One study conducted by researchers in British Columbia found that building a five-story office building with wood had less than a third of the global warming impact when compared with a steel and concrete building of the same size. Beyond taking less energy to produce, wood buildings store carbon that otherwise would have returned to the atmosphere as those trees died and began to decay. The wooden structure of the new 18-story Brock Commons dormitory at the University of British Columbia, for example, stores 1,753 metric tons of carbon dioxide. That carbon will be locked up for decades, if not a century or more, until the building is torn down, and if the wood is reused, perhaps even longer.
Additional benefits come from the fact that these new wood technologies make it affordable to construct mid-rise housing of six to 12 stories. Conventional wood framing is limited to five stories by building codes, or six stories if a concrete first floor is included. The high cost of materials and construction -- for example, renting a tower crane and hiring someone to operate it -- usually push developers working to construct steel and concrete housing to design and build structures of more than 12 stories to provide a suitable return on investment.
Transportation hubs in the inner suburbs of cities in the United States are often surrounded by multifamily housing of only five or six stories. With CLT, those buildings could be taller, creating more housing close to trains, subways and buses, and a more compact urban development pattern. That would save forests on the urban fringe from being cut to make way for more housing, and cut emissions and congestion on highways. Taller mid-rise wood buildings would also help lower the cost of housing by increasing supply.
To stabilize climate and support the wood building revolution, we need to stop the conversion of forests to other uses -- whether to pastures in the Amazon or to shopping malls, houses and solar arrays near Amherst, Mass. When forests are cleared for housing or other land uses, the carbon stored in the forest is typically released to the atmosphere, and the ability of the forest to capture future carbon is lost.
The Harvard Forest and Highstead Foundation are leading an effort to stop the land clearing for development that destroyed over 850,000 acres of forest between 1990 and 2010 and will consume 1.2 million more acres by 2060 absent a new approach. Harvard Forest's Wildlands and Woodlands vision calls for conserving at least 90 percent of the remaining forests of New England, setting aside 10 percent of that area as wild reserves where no trees are harvested. Retaining 90 percent of New England's forests not only will help prevent climate change but also will help provide about $ 700 million per year in improved human health and agricultural productivity and will sustain 30,000 jobs -- and even more as new urban wood buildings come into their own.
A 2014 study by scientists from Harvard Forest and the Smithsonian Institution examined the carbon consequences of applying exemplary management to forests across Massachusetts. The results showed we could double production of wood while maintaining wildlife habitat, clean air and water, forest carbon and places for human recreation. In the heavily harvested industrial forest lands of northern New England there is even more potential for a greater carbon sequestration. The New England Forestry Foundation estimates that with exemplary management these forests could absorb hundreds of millions of tons of carbon, removing as much carbon from the atmosphere as would be released by all seven million cars in New England for 20 years.
Forest ecosystems and wood buildings can be our most important climate allies. We should minimize the conversion of forests, enable more wood construction and incentivize private landowners to improve their stewardship. Policies to achieve these goals should include greater state and local bonding to amplify the impact of private land conservation funding. Incentives that encourage the construction of wood buildings that are drawn from forests with outstanding management are key to our climate future and the future of the forest.
These policies will produce more carbon standing in living, beautiful, productive forests, which also provide the raw materials for equally beautiful, affordable cities that store even more carbon. By tying together the city and the forest, this effort could unite rural and urban citizens toward shared goals -- a livable climate, a viable economy and a vibrant, living landscape.

Texto completo: Leigh Bardugo, the author of best-selling books like "Shadow and Bone" and "Six of Crows," has written "Ninth House," which features occult versions of the secret societies at Yale.
PASADENA, Calif. -- There are many things that might attract a potential student to Yale, but the gloom of New Haven's dead-of-winter aesthetic is not the first that springs to mind. Unless, perhaps, you come from California and you hate the sunshine and you are Leigh Bardugo, future fantasy novelist.
"It was cold and gray, and it was in January," Bardugo said recently, describing the joy of her first visit to campus, as an alienated Los Angeles teenager. "You can't imagine what it was like for a young Goth kid, this place of stonework and bare branches and darkness and strange wonderful buildings. I felt so at ease there."
Bardugo, now 44 and living back in Los Angeles, had chosen as her preferred interview location Gold Bug, a Victorian-vibed jewelry-and-curio boutique named for an Edgar Allan Poe short story. With its delicate taxidermied fawn, ostrich-egg chandelier and framed prints of lethal snakes, the shop is a little oasis of anti-Californiana in a neighborhood of peppy athleisure stores. Bardugo loves it.
"Things that are dark and close to the other side are what bring me joy," she said.
If you read young adult fantasy fiction, you may well share that view. And you will most likely have heard of Bardugo, a superstar in the crowded genre, with books like "Shadow and Bone" and "Six of Crows," both set in the Grishaverse, a universe where people can harness magic and science in extraordinary ways, for good and for evil.
Her books have sold more than three million copies in English, been translated into 41 languages and are being made into a series commissioned by Netflix. "Six of Crows" spent more than a year on The New York Times's best-seller list. Bardugo's following is passionate, nearly cultlike.
"Ninth House," her latest novel and her first for adults, is set not in a fake universe, but in and around Yale -- although a Yale dreamt of only in Bardugo's own philosophy. Its streets, for starters, are teeming with ghosts, many bearing the gaping wounds that killed them, who cluster around the living but can be seen only by a few.
Meanwhile, the dean of the college does secret double duty as the faculty liaison with a shadowy organization called Lethe House. In this alt-Yale, Lethe is charged with regulating the magic practiced at the eight most powerful of Yale's famous secret societies, known here as the Ancient Eight or the Houses of the Veil.
These elite clubs exist in real life, minus the occult nicknames, and their self-mythologizing exoticism is profoundly satisfying to their members and profoundly irritating to everyone else. (Do the men of Skull and Bones really strip naked and masturbate en masse into a sacred sarcophagus while leveraging their alumni connections into fancy postcollege careers? Don't ask them or they will supposedly have to leave the room.)
"I thought, 'Wouldn't it be fun if these senior societies weren't just old boys' networks and drinking clubs? What if they were actually centers of arcane magic?"' Bardugo said.
Yes, it would indeed be fun. Each has its own specialty in "Ninth House": Skull and Bones practices divination using human entrails; St. Elmo conjures storms; Aurelian does fantastical things with books and language, at one point curing a novelist's writer's block with a ritual involving the exchange of blood and ink.
According to established genre conventions, the novel Bardugo planned had to be aimed at adults, she explained. "Y.A. fiction tends to have a finite quality," she said. "You're looking toward a goal -- prom or graduation or revolution -- and we leave these characters after a moment of tremendous transformation."
She continued: "But the challenges faced by my heroine are different and don't stop at one particular point." She was referring to Alex, the star of "Ninth House," a traumatized freshman whose work for Lethe is both painful and revelatory. "The goal for her is trying to survive in the world and take care of the people she loves."
The book is full of insider Yale jokes, including a running gag that Berzelius, one of the senior societies, has no magical specialty and no famous alumni. ("The idea is that they were left behind by their adherence to science," the author said.)
As an undergraduate, Bardugo was a member of Wolf's Head, to whose members she has awarded the fictional specialty of therianthropy -- the ability to change from human to animal form.
Alas, that is not the case in real life.
"I cannot shapeshift into an animal," she said. "But I can shapeshift into a drunker person."
Born in Israel, Bardugo soon after moved to her grandparents' house in Los Angeles with her mother. (Her father is not part of her life.) Almost nothing appealed to her about California -- not the other kids, not the clothes, not the "Sweet Valley High" books that her classmates loved but that left her traumatized.
"It wasn't until I picked up Neil Gaiman, Diana Wynne Jones and Stephen King that I found there were people who were like me," she said.
The feeling of otherness flared when she visited Princeton as a potential applicant.
"I stayed with these girls who had a water fight in the dorm," she recalled. "They were like, 'You're going to think we're so wild!"' But what she actually thought was: "I need to be free from this hellscape immediately."
After college, Bardugo took her time finding her way to fiction writing. She worked at an advertising agency, at an alternative newspaper, at various dot-coms. She wrote the scripts for movie trailers and became a makeup and special-effects artist. She applied for and got in to several M.F.A. writing programs, but was too depressed to enroll.
What she was meant to do was write fantasy, she realized. She completed her first novel, "Shadow and Bone," the first of a trilogy featuring a scrappy heroine named Alina Starkov, at the age of 35. She has produced more than half a dozen novels set in the same world, and recently wrote "Wonder Woman: Warbringer" for the DC Icons series of books. She works on several things at once; her mind is full of her stories.
Bardugo wears all black, and during the interview accessorized her outfit with a ring depicting two moths and a necklace of the Three of Swords tarot symbol. She is an admirer of the Crone, one of the three faces of the Wicca moon goddess, who represents the wisdom and power that come with maturity.
"I have been taught my whole life to fear aging, to fear changes to my body and to the way the world will perceive me," she said. "At this age, getting to live the life I want, I feel so much more powerful than I ever have. I love the idea of the Crone and her power, and that none of it derives from sexual desire."
"Ninth House" can be dark and violent; the dead do not always rest peacefully, and life is hard for those who live. But the book is also a kind of wish fulfillment, the extension of Bardugo's own yearning. She expects it to be the first in a series of perhaps five books that will take Alex through graduation.
"This was the moment he'd been waiting for," she writes of one of her characters, after he has performed a neat magic spell: "the chance to show someone else wonder, to watch them realize that they had not been lied to, that the world they'd been promised as children was not something that had to be abandoned."
She shares that feeling, from the perspective of someone living in a nonmagic world. It registers as a kind of heartache, she said, a "homesickness for a place you have never been."
"We never stop looking," she went on. "We're all waiting for that moment -- this belief that there will be no back to the wardrobe, that it goes all the way through."

Texto completo: Headnote 'THIS GAME IS MY LIFE'
Jenna Papagni stood amid a crowd of hundreds outside the Wells Fargo Center last Sunday. She was at the Philadelphia arena for the'Overwatch League Grand Finals, an annual esports tournament, and she came dressed for battle.
"This game is my life," said Papagni, a 20-year-old from Newark who was dressed as D.Va, an Overwatch character who fights in a mechanical exoskeleton.
The league is modeled after traditional sports, with teams in 20 cities on three continents competing in a seven-month season that was drawing to its conclusion.
Like many of the 12,000 fans who converged at the sold-out tournament to see the San Francisco Shock take on the Vancouver Titans, Papagni was drawn to the game because of its inclusionary nature and ease of entry.
"They made a game where anyone can be the hero, including a woman," she said.
That was the goal of Blizzard Entertainment, which released Overwatch in 2016 with a strategy to make the game as appealing as possible to all players, regardless of sex, orientation or race.
"It's always been our intent to reflect the world the way that it is," said Chacko Sonny, an executive producer and vice president at Blizzard. "There is such a wide range of people out there."
When Blizzard started a professional league for the game in 2018, it applied a franchise model, similar to that of traditional sports teams. In the league's inaugural season, every match was played at Blizzard Arena in Burbank, California. But this year, the company tested what it called homestand weekends, when some teams played in their home cities, like Atlanta and Dallas.
The strategy has paid off. The league finished the 2019 season with an average global audience of 313,000 viewers, up 18% from the year before, according to Blizzard. The company said it planned to expand the hometown model to more cities next year.
As more fans flock to professional esports leagues - including ones for blockbuster games like Call of Duty World League and League of Legends - global revenue for the esports industry is expected to surpass $1 billion this year, up 27% from last year, according to a report from Newzoo, a market intelligence firm.
To sustain that growth, said Jurre Pannekeet, a senior market analyst at Newzoo, game publishers must keep their fans engaged.
For Overwatch fans, the devotion runs deep.
Many came to the finals in Philadelphia dressed as their favorite characters, and the mood felt as if the NFL and Comic Con had gotten together to throw a rave.
Zedd, the DJ, kicked off the event with a performance and was joined onstage by singer Kehlani. Questlove, the drummer for the Roots and a native Philadelphian, played during game breaks.
Veronica Kot, 24, of Jefferson, New Jersey, plays Overwatch about 15 hours a week, and streams Overwatch League matches online when she's not playing. "Anyone can play it," she said. "You are not defined by your physique, gender or orientation."
Tom Morris dressed as Zarya, a tank character who specializes in protecting her allies. "It was good to see a strong female character in the game," he said.
He added that he was at the tournament to support the Philadelphia Fusion, which did not make the finals: "I'm a big Fusion fan. It's my hometown team."
The Fusion will soon have a permanent home next to the Wells Fargo Center, which is home to the Philadelphia 76ers and Flyers, when the 3,500-seat Fusion Arena opens in 2021. It will be the first venue in the United States built specifically for esports.
Hannah and Madison Katein, 16-year-old sisters from Reading, came with their father, Mike. "It's a nice family-bonding experience," Hannah said as they walked around a fan fest outside the Wells Fargo Center, hosted by corporate sponsors like Coca-Cola, T-Mobile and Toyota.
Inside the arena, the atmosphere was pulsing with energy.
Fans raised their arms donned with LED wristbands that lit up in sync when the music pulsed. Booths hawked team merchandise, and fans snapped up caps, jerseys and scarves. Merchandise and ticket sales are expected to bring in $104 million in 2019, according to Newzoo.
Brian Perlstein, 33, a special-education teacher from Bloomfield, New Jersey, prowled the concourse in a tiger mask, representing the mascot of the league's Seoul Dynasty. "It's a traditional sport: Why not go full out and support your team?" he said.
The mash-up of styles drew Jeff Staple, a streetwear designer from New York and a fan of the game, to scout trends. "I'm here to study," he said. "I'm looking at all the things these fans are buying."
By the end of the final match three hours later, the crowd was showered in confetti. The San Francisco Shock had swept the Vancouver Titans for the title and $1.1 million in prize money.
"I already have my tickets for next year," said Morris, the Fusion fan.

Texto completo: Most business tools can be used either well or badly.
Email can speed interoffice communications, or it can overwhelm with too much information. Spreadsheets can make calculations easier or they can be riddled with hard-to-find errors. Word processing can create attractive, easy-to-read documents or, well, Comic Sans.
When used well, such tools make an organization smarter, more creative, and able to make better decisions. When used poorly, they do the opposite. The classic misuse of email, SPAM, for example, creates visual and mental noise.
Most productivity tools have these two sides. But PowerPoint is different. When used poorly, PowerPoint makes an organization dumb. When used well, PowerPoint makes that organization even dumber. Let me explain.
(Note: by "PowerPoint" I mean the Microsoft product and its clones.)
Every description of PowerPoint best practices suggests using PowerPoint to make your presentation more vivid, alive and entertaining. A common way to do this is to animate your graphs, so that the bars grow into their final position, right before your audience's eyes. Cool, eh?
Well, it turns out that animated graphs lead to bad decision-making. Robert Cialdini, professor emeritus of psychology and marketing at Arizona State University, and author of the classic business bestseller "Influence: the Psychology of Persuasion" (www.influenceatwork.com), showed three groups of people performance statistics for a fictional high-school football player named Andrew. He then asked each group to rate Andrew, as a player, from one to seven.
The first group received a hard-copy table of statistics, the second group got a hard-copy of a bar graph, and the third group were shown a PowerPoint presentation with animated graphs. The first two groups rated Andrew a 4.5 and five respectively. The group that saw the animated graphs rated the Andrew a six.
Cialdini repeated the experiment using sports fans who were more experienced at understanding such statistics. The first two groups came up with the same number. The group shown the animated graphs rated Andrew as high as the novices had done, as a six.
In other words, this "best practices" PowerPoint technique fooled even experts into giving a higher rating. As the New Yorker summarized, "PowerPoint seems to be a way for organizations to turn expensive, expert decision-makers into novice decision-makers."
A similar study of PowerPoint usage at the University of Houston that was published in "Computers & Education" found that "students performed worse on quizzes when PowerPoint presentations included non-text items such as pictures and sound effects."
Another study at Purdue University, also published in "Computers & Education" found that "students retained 15% less information delivered verbally by the lecturer during PowerPoint presentations."
Yet another study, this one from Harvard, showed that having words on a screen while you're talking has no effect, positive or negative, on comprehension or retention, rendering your efforts to create the presentation completely wasted.
Are you seeing the pattern here? PowerPoint isn't helping, regardless of how it's used. So what gives?
The root problem with PowerPoint is the way it encourages you to think, says Edward Tufte, an expert on information design. According to a New York Times article summarizing Tufte:
"Microsoft's ubiquitous software forces people to mutilate data beyond comprehension. For example, the low resolution of a PowerPoint slide means that it usually contains only about 40 words, or barely eight seconds of reading. PowerPoint also encourages users to rely on bulleted lists, a 'faux analytical' technique... that dodges the speaker's responsibility to tie his information together."
Or as Tufte himself put it: "PowerPoint induces stupidity, turns everyone into bores, wastes time, and downgrades the quality and credibility of communication."
In other words, PowerPoint makes your organization dumber.
That's why, incidentally, PowerPoint is so excellent as a sales tool (as opposed to a productivity tool.) PowerPoint dumbs the customer down, making them more likely to make a buying decision based on bells and whistles rather than actual information.
The alternative
If you want your organization to get smarter rather than dumber, here's what you do:
*Ban PowerPoint from your workplace. That's for all internal meetings but especially when people from outside your organization are trying to sell you something.
*Start every meeting with a group reading. Prepare a short document summarizing the issues, providing some analysis, and defining the decision on the table.
*Writing a briefing document (as opposed to slapping down bullet points) forces people in your organization to think their ideas through, before expending everyone else's time on them. It also makes your meetings shorter and more to-the-point.
That strategy comes, BTW, from Amazon's CEO Jeff Bezos. So if you're still clinging to PowerPoint, you might consider that maybe Jeff Bezos knows more than you when it comes to making an organization smarter.

Texto completo: His crooning in Czech and several other languages brought him great popularity, especially in countries behind the Iron Curtain.
Karel Gott, a romantic Czech crooner whose popularity behind the Iron Curtain helped earn him the nickname "Sinatra of the East," died on Tuesday at his home in Prague. He was 80.
His death was confirmed by his wife, Ivana Gottova, on his website. Last month he wrote on Facebook that he had received a diagnosis of acute leukemia.
"Extremely sad news for our whole country," Milos Zeman, president of the Czech Republic, said in a statement. "Karel Gott was a real artist who gave himself to others."
A dapper and expressive tenor who sang in Czech, English, Russian, French and German, Mr. Gott recorded hundreds of albums and performed before audiences in his home country; in Poland, Austria, Hungary, Romania and West Germany; and in the United States and Canada.
He won the Golden Nightingale Award as his country's top male singer, voted on by Czech music fans, 42 times.
"It says a lot that almost everyone in the Czech Republic loves Karel Gott," Pavel Turek, a music journalist with the Czech magazine Respekt, told The New York Times in 2017. "His popularity is exceptional, and it is really interesting that all generations appreciate him."
Mr. Gott largely thrived under Communism in Czechoslovakia. He was not known for challenging the Soviet-backed regime. But while on tour in West Germany in 1971, he said he would remain in the West indefinitely -- he did not specifically call it a defection -- because of the Czech government's attempts to censor his lyrics and demands that he cut his long hair.
Gustav Husak, the chief of Czechoslovakia's Communist Party, rebuked him at the Slovak party congress as a pampered performer.
"Everyone knows what conditions of work we gave him -- glory, money, as much as he wanted, travel throughout the world," Mr. Husak said. "Let him decide for himself if he wants to return to serve the Western bourgeoisie."
Mr. Gott did return, several months later, after Mr. Husak took a surprisingly conciliatory tone in a letter that guaranteed the singer's continued freedom to travel to the West to perform.
"It was completely logical" to accept Mr. Husak's appeal, Mr. Gott told the writer Alan Levy in an article in 1978 for the journal Index on Censorship. "The Czechoslovak people made me whatever I am. Besides, I wanted very badly to see my parents."
Karel Gott was born on July 14, 1939, in Pilsen, which had become a part of the protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia after Nazi Germany's invasion of Czechoslovakia. His desire to sing was initially discouraged by his father, who wanted him to learn a trade. He worked as an electrician for several years until he began studying opera at the Prague State Conservatory in 1960.
He was soon performing on television and radio and in theaters. He won his first Golden Nightingale in 1964. He signed with Polydor, a major European record company, in the late 1960s; his first Polydor contract eventually became a lifetime deal.
One of his biggest hits was the theme song from "Maya the Bee," a popular German cartoon series. Singing in various languages, he covered hit songs like "Moon River," "Pretty Woman," and "Lara's Theme," from the film "Dr. Zhivago."
In 1985, Mr. Gott was named a National Artist by the Czech government. In 2009, Vaclav Klaus, president of the Czech Republic, presented him with the Medal of Merit for his contributions to Czech culture. But the government's decision to give Mr. Gott the medal was excoriated by Jan Rejzek, a culture critic.
"My view is that the president should honor people who were persecuted by the former regime," Mr. Rejzek told Czech Radio. "And it strikes me as distasteful when someone is honored for 'only' being good at what they do -- without the same level of merit."
When Mr. Gott received his final Golden Nightingale at a ceremony in Prague in late 2017, he dealt with the incongruity of sharing the spotlight with a neo-Nazi heavy metal band, Ortel, which won second place in its category.
"The organizers made a big mistake," he told The Times, referring to Ortel, some of whose songs have anti-Muslim lyrics. "They should have made a rule that you cannot mix politics and music."
Complete information on his survivors was not available.
In July, hundreds of fans lined up outside a record shop in Prague to buy a limited edition of souvenir zero-denomination bank notes bearing Mr. Gott's portrait in honor of his 80th birthday. Some had slept overnight to buy a maximum of two notes.
"The zero euro is a big phenomenon in our country," one fan told France 24, a news channel, "and so is Karel Gott."

Dems behavior mimics what they once criticized

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — President Trump’s critics are now complaining that he asked the Australian prime minister to cooperate with the Justice Department’s investigation into the origins of the Mueller probe and that Attorney General William Barr has traveled overseas to ask foreign intelligence officials to cooperate with that investigation. The New York Times called it another example of “the president using high-level diplomacy to advance his personal political interests.”
No, it’s not. The president’s critics are conflating two different things: the investigation by Trump’s private lawyer, Rudolph Giuliani, into Hunter Biden’s business dealings, and the official inquiry by U.S. Attorney John Durham into the counterintelligence investigation directed at the Trump campaign during the 2016 election. The former is opposition research activity; the latter is a criminal justice matter.
There is absolutely nothing wrong with asking foreign heads of state or intelligence officials to cooperate with an official Justice Department investigation. As George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley explains, “It is not uncommon for an attorney general, or even a president, to ask foreign leaders to assist with ongoing investigations. Such calls can shortcut bureaucratic red tape, particularly if the evidence is held, as in this case, by national security or justice officials.”
Americans support the Durham probe. For two years, they were told by Trump’s opponents that the president was “working on behalf of the Russians” and had committed “treasonous” acts that were of “a size and scope probably beyond Watergate.” Those were serious accusations, and Americans took them seriously. They waited for special counsel Robert Mueller to tell them whether the president had indeed betrayed the country.
Then Mueller issued his report, and they found out that none of it was true. They understandably wanted answers. How did it come to pass that our government was paralyzed for two years and spent tens of millions of their tax dollars, chasing a Trump-Russia collusion conspiracy theory? A Harvard CAPS-Harris Poll following the Mueller report’s public release found that 53% of Americans said that “bias against President Trump in the FBI played a role in launching investigations against him,” and 62% supported appointing a special counsel to investigate the investigation of Trump.
Instead of a special counsel, Barr appointed Durham, a career prosecutor, to lead the investigation that Americans demanded. Durham is a man of unimpeachable character who was appointed by Obama administration Attorney General Eric Holder to investigate the CIA’s terrorist interrogation program. At the conclusion of that probe, which ended without any criminal charges, Holder praised Durham for working “tirelessly to conduct an extraordinarily thorough and complete” investigation.
Now Barr has asked Durham to bring the same tireless professionalism to his investigation into the origins of the Mueller probe. But suddenly, all those who were so eager to find out what happened in 2016 when they thought Mueller would reveal that Trump conspired with the Russians have lost interest. The same people who were outraged at Trump’s efforts to discredit the Mueller probe are now doing the exact same thing to the Durham probe. Back then, Democrats insisted Trump stop criticizing the investigation and “let Mueller follow the facts wherever they lead.” Now they need to heed their own advice: Stop criticizing the investigation. Let Durham follow the facts wherever they lead. If there was no wrongdoing, then there is nothing to worry about.
To be sure, Trump bears some responsibility for helping Democrats lump together Durham’s official investigation with Giuliani’s partisan activities by mentioning them both on the call with Ukraine’s president. There should be a firewall between the two inquiries. Instead, Trump and Giuliani have blurred those lines.
But keep in mind, it was the Democrats who told us there is nothing wrong or illegal with a presidential candidate hiring a private lawyer to conduct opposition research in a foreign country on their political opponents. After it emerged that the Clinton campaign and the DNC had paid Christopher Steele to dig up dirt in Russia on Trump, the Democrats’ defense was: That’s just opposition research. Everyone does it. The biggest problem with the Steele dossier was not that Democrats paid for opposition research, but that the FBI might have used it as the basis for spying on the Trump campaign — which is part of what Durham is investigating.
Durham is no partisan actor. Despite political pressure, he cleared the CIA of wrongdoing during the Obama administration. Like Mueller, he will follow the facts wherever they lead. Maybe that is why so many Democrats are up in arms.

Texto completo: When colleague Carl Bernstein called Bob Woodward in the wee hours of September 8, 1974, to tell him the president had just pardoned Richard Nixon, the Washington Post reporter was convinced a handshake had occurred.
"I would have staked my life on it, this act of the pardon was corrupt," Woodward told an audience of 1,100 people Friday at the Spokane Convention Center, during his second public appearance in the city in two days as part of Whitworth University's Presidential Leadership Forum.
But an interview a quarter century later with President Gerald Ford convinced Woodward otherwise. What he thought had been corrupt, he said, was actually an act of courage to propel the nation past the Watergate scandal.
"He said, 'I needed my own presidency,'" Woodward recalled.
The 76-year-old Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter and author used the anecdote as an example of the dangers of emotion and certainty creeping into the journalistic process. Woodward said that lesson was particularly poignant, as President Donald Trump - whom is the subject of Woodward's latest book - faces his own impeachment inquiry at the hands of House Democrats.
Woodward said the scope of Watergate had been lost in the ensuing years, and cautioned against lawmakers limiting the scope of their queries to phone calls with foreign dignitaries. The money trail - made famous by Hal Holbrook's delivery of the three-word command "Follow the money" in the 1976 film "All the President's Men" - was what led to the most damning charges against Nixon, Woodward said.
"They're looking through a keyhole, and it's a panorama," Woodward said of current House investigators.
Thursday's talk with Whitworth students focused on the process of reporting, including how to verify information and how to get people to spill their guts. Woodward's speech Friday reflected on the two years of investigative reporting that uncovered Nixon's plans to undermine the democratic process, and what today's electorate and media should learn from Watergate.
"The central lesson of Watergate is the importance of truth in our national dialogue," Woodward said in a speech that lasted roughly half an hour, followed by a question-and-answer period with Whitworth University President Beck Taylor.
That trust has eroded due to attacks on the veracity of the press, casting what Woodward called "a shadow" over the profession. But Woodward, who has covered the administrations of nine presidents and interviewed Trump, said he didn't believe the president really believed journalists were spies and that it was part of his posturing in office.
Trump's posturing has included publicly stating what Woodward told a gathering Friday before his speech were impeachable offenses, including suggesting that China and Ukraine should investigate the family of Joe Biden, who's running for the Democratic nomination.
Taylor asked Woodward if he thought that act was criminal.
"No, it's probably not criminal, because no one ever thought to make a law about it," said Woodward, to laughter from the audience.
But Woodward also said the impeachment proceedings are emboldening some GOP lawmakers. He said publicly a Republican senator, whom he earlier identified as South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, told the reporter recently "he couldn't count the money fast enough" that had come in as donations after the House announced its inquiry.
Graham, once a staunch critic of Trump and his presidential nomination, has become a close Trump ally, criticizing Democrats at confirmation hearings for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh from his position as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Graham, who was one of 13 House Republicans who served as managers of the impeachment inquiry into President Bill Clinton, faces a 2020 challenger in Democrat Jaime Harrison, who has reportedly raised $4 million since February.
"I know Republican senators, and they are choking on this," said Woodward of the allegations made against, and admissions made by, Trump regarding the solicitation of foreign interference in the 2020 presidential election. "Whether they say that's too much, I don't know."
Woodward lauded the reporting of his own paper, the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal by name in their coverage of the Trump presidency. But, he said, the profession needed to continue to follow a nonpartisan, patient but aggressive stance toward reporting in order to not only regain trust with the public, but also to uncover the unvarnished truth, as it took him 25 years to do with Ford's pardon.
"It requires a really large effort, and I hope we're up to it," said Woodward.

Texto completo: Let's be clear: President Donald Trump's call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy was not "beautiful" or "perfect." Far from it.
Mr. Trump should not have asked Mr. Zelenskiy to investigate Hunter Biden or to cooperate with his private attorney Rudolph Giuliani's investigation of the former vice president's son. Because Mr. Trump made no promises or threats in the call, it is a stretch to claim his conduct rises to the level of "high crimes and misdemeanors." But it was highly inappropriate.
However, it does not follow that Mr. Trump's malfeasance absolves Joe Biden and his son of their malfeasance. Two things can be true at the same time: that Mr. Trump did something wrong, and that Joe and Hunter Biden did something wrong as well. This seems to be lost on many in the media, who are bending over backward to absolve the Bidens of wrongdoing.
For example, many in the media state as fact that Mr. Biden's actions in encouraging the firing of Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin had nothing to do with his investigation of the natural gas company, Burisma, which employed Hunter Biden as a board member. His firing was justified, they say, because the U.S. government, the International Monetary Fund and other U.S. allies were demanding he be fired as well. Furthermore, as CNN's Jake Tapper insisted this weekend, "according to the Ukrainians that investigation [into Burisma] was dormant at the time."
First, the phrase "dormant" means, by definition, that an investigation into Burisma existed and was not closed. Second, we don't know for certain that the Burisma investigation was, in fact, "dormant." Mr. Shokin has sworn in an affidavit it was not. His successor says it was. Who is lying? Nobody knows for sure. Journalists don't get to choose which version they prefer and report it as fact.
But here is what is incontestably true: Joe Biden had a conflict of interest. His son took a position with a Ukrainian natural gas company, despite having no experience in Ukraine or natural gas, the very same month the elder Biden visited Kiev and urged Ukraine to increase its natural gas production. As Yoshiko Herrera, an expert in Russia and Eurasia policy at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, put it, "conflict-of-interest rules should have applied."
The latest spin is that there is nothing to see here because, as Reuters reports, the investigation of Burisma "focused solely on activity that took place before Hunter Biden, son of former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, was hired to sit on its board." Did it occur to anyone that maybe that is precisely why Burisma hired the American vice president's son? According to The New York Times, Hunter's hiring "allowed Burisma to create the perception that it was backed by powerful Americans." As Robert Weissman, president of the progressive watchdog Public Citizen, has said, "It's hard to avoid the conclusion that Hunter's foreign employers and partners were seeking to leverage Hunter's relationship with Joe, either by seeking improper influence or to project access to him."
The revelation that Hunter Biden accepted a job with a Ukrainian company that was under investigation while his father was taking the lead in fighting corruption in Ukraine is damning, not exculpatory.
Mr. Biden knew about his son's involvement with Burisma, because The New Yorker has reported that in December 2015 Obama energy czar Amos Hochstein "raised the matter with Biden." We also know, via The New York Times, that "some State Department officials had expressed concern that Hunter Biden's work in Ukraine could complicate his father's diplomacy there." No doubt, there is a paper trail at the State Department to that effect.
The Code of Federal Regulations clearly states that when a federal official takes action he knows will affect "a relative with whom the employee has a close personal relationship" and "the circumstances would cause a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts to question his impartiality in the matter, the employee should not participate in the matter." In other words, Joe Biden should not have taken the lead on Ukraine policy while Hunter Biden was working for Burisma. And even if Mr. Shokin deserved to be fired, Hunter had no business being the one to deliver the ultimatum.
Hunter Biden's business dealings, in Ukraine and elsewhere, are crying out for investigation. That does not mean it was appropriate for Mr. Trump to raise them with the Ukrainian president. But the fact that Mr. Trump did so does not give the media carte blanche to make excuses for the Biden family.

Reflecting on one El of an era

Texto completo: Al Zelazo can still remember how the wooden platform would sway on the old Myrtle Avenue El.
"The first time up there I said, 'Dad, what's that?!' As a kid you're nervous," said Zelazo, who grew up in Brooklyn. "'Oh, that's just the El leaving Bridge-Jay Streets,' he would say. You could tell when the train got moving again. The whole structure would shake."
Friday marks the 50th anniversary of the death of the old El, which at one point linked commuters from Ridgewood, Glendale and Maspeth to parts of downtown Brooklyn and lower Manhattan, rumbling over the Brooklyn Bridge. There is still an arm of the abandoned section reaching out from Bushwick, hanging over a block of Myrtle Avenue west of Broadway.
Zelazo, known as "Subway Al," is a retired PATH worker who sells train memorabilia. He rode the train on occasion with his father. It was the only rapid transit line still using wooden cars at the time; their rattan seats and canvas straps were a draw as a novelty.
"We would go just to ride it and ride the wooden cars," he said.
But the general public sentiment wasn't as rosy. Many viewed the Els as antiquated as subways and private automobiles proliferated and that notion helped lead to the demise of the elevated lines across the city, including along Myrtle Avenue.
"What happens with the Myrtle Avenue El kind of parallels what was happening in Brooklyn - ridership peaked in the 1920s," said Rob DelBagno, the New York Transit Museum's manager of exhibitions. "The 20s is a prosperous time and how people are moving around in the late 1920s is really changing fast. The subway system is expanding and people are buying cars."
The Els were unbearably loud and cast a shadow over streets storefronts. Officials at the time would promote their removal as an effort to "open up the sky."
But the Myrtle El, built and opened in 1888, was a key complement of the Brooklyn Bridge to help facilitate the development of deeper parts of Brooklyn and Queens - like Bushwick and Ridgewood - before either were incorporated as boroughs of New York City.
At the time areas like Brooklyn Heights had been established as well as what were akin to little villages, like Williamsburg. The elevated line's first few stops passed through other established areas, too, like what's now Fort Greene and Cobble Hill.
"But the rest of the trip going into what's now Bushwick and Ridgewood, Queens - those places barely existed at that point," said DelBagno. "It had a huge effect on Brooklyn. Industrial Williamsburg grew around the El, residential Ridgewood, Queens, grew around the El. It had a big effect in the late 19th century and early 20th century."
But when the depression hit, the bustling waterfront economy was disappearing and without jobs fewer commuters had reason to take the El to Brooklyn's piers and warehouses. Ridership saw an uptick briefly, during World War II, when the Brooklyn Navy Yard became the borough's largest employer. But when the war was over, ridership fell off hard. As other Els were torn down, it seemed to be only a matter of time for Myrtle's demise.
Joe Raskin, author of The Routes Not Taken: A Trip Through New York City's Unbuilt Subway System, said officials had disregarded maintenance of the Els, sealing their fate.
"The powers at be chose not to maintain it and it became what was a self-fulfilling prophecy," he said. "'It's not going to accomplish anything to repair it, so let's not repair it.' And then look at what happened."
A newer section of the Myrtle Avenue El built at the start of World War I is still operational and serves the M running into Middle Village. The rest of the line was replaced by bus service, and arguably the G line and the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway.
The Transit Authority announced the closure of the Myrtle Avenue El abruptly, the summer before it shuttered. William Ronan, the authority's chairman at the time, touted the opening of "a 35-block stretch of Myrtle Avenue to light and air."
In 1968 the authority collected 4.5 million fares combined at the eight stations that were shuttered. The Myrtle-Willoughby Avenues station of the G train, for example, brought in roughly three times as many fares in 2018 than the average shuttered station along Myrtle Avenue El in 1968.
"The closure of the Els really added stress to the streets and existing transit system," said Raskin. "And if you think of what's going on now with the L train, the Myrtle El could have really provided an alternative service."
Myrtle's demise did not come without protest. Small groups of residents picketed outside of the city's Board of Transportation offices. Queens commuters pleaded for a reopening at a 1970 public hearing, saying the replacement bus service doubled their trip times, according to a report in The New York Times.
The closure of the El, as well as the construction of the BQE in the mid-20th century, ended up taking a toll on the surrounding neighborhoods for years.
"The construction of the BQE took out a city-block-wide stretch all the way through Brooklyn," said DelBagno, "And at the same time you don't have the ridership on the Myrtle Avenue El. Restaurants and bars that used to be along the El all went out of business and all of those neighborhoods really had a downturn for several decades."
The lasting legacy of the Myrtle El is the beautiful brownstones that popped up along the route in the 1880s and 1890s said DelBagno.
Just as New Yorkers do today, riders flocked to the Myrtle El for its last run. A banner was attached to the front of the train bidding it farewell. One rider was photographed with a train car's rattan seat on his shoulder as he hauled it away.
"I rode it just to ride it, knowing it was coming to an end," said Ed Gerson, 74, who was born in Brooklyn, living in Flatbush at the time.
It was a week before the Myrtle's closure and Gerson's first and last trip on the line.
"I probably rode from Broadway to Bridge-Jay Streets," said Gerson. "I wanted to be able to say I was on it. I'm not a sentimental person, but it was fun."

Texto completo: During a career spanning nearly five decades, Bob Woodward has interviewed several presidents, dozens of cabinet officials and, most famously, W. Mark Felt, an associate F.B.I. director who helped him piece together the narrative that led to the resignation of President Richard M. Nixon.
But Mr. Woodward, a longtime Washington Post reporter who is an associate editor at the paper, was heckled on Wednesday night while interviewing the New York Times reporters Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey. They are the authors of the book "She Said," a chronicle of their investigation into the sexual misconduct allegations against Harvey Weinstein and other powerful men that won them a Pulitzer Prize and was instrumental in jump-starting the global #MeToo movement.
The event, at the Sixth and I building in Washington, started with Mr. Woodward referring to "She Said" as "a masterpiece." At one point, according to an attendee, he said he planned to assign it to his journalism students.
Twenty minutes into the interview, however, the mood changed. Mr. Woodward repeatedly interrupted Ms. Kantor and Ms. Twohey and posed questions that, to many attendees, suggested a lack of understanding of sexual assault and workplace harassment.
Audience members voiced their objections -- "Let her finish!" one person shouted during one of Mr. Woodward's interruptions -- and registered their complaints on social media in real time, according to several accounts and interviews.
One attendee, Robyn Swirling, the founder of the nonprofit Works in Progress, said Mr. Woodward had done a poor job. "It wasn't just the interrupting," Ms. Swirling said in an interview on Thursday. "It was some really inappropriate questions that were just so clearly lacking in any sort of understanding of the dynamics of sexual violence."
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
In a statement after the event, Mr. Woodward said: "As a longtime believer in the First Amendment, I am glad people got to express themselves. Jodi and Megan signed a copy of their book for me after the session, which I enjoyed very much, and said, 'Thank you for the fabulous questions.' So there may be a difference of opinion. Welcome to America!"
In a statement, Ms. Kantor and Ms. Twohey said: "We're just starting our book tour, and we're grateful to all the moderators -- Bob Woodward, Katie Couric, America Ferrera and many others -- who have agreed to join us onstage. We welcome all questions, from them and especially from the audience, because each one is an opportunity to relate the wrenching decisions that many of our sources had to make and grapple with Metoo as an example and test of social change in our time."
Accusing them of "artfully dodging" his questions, Mr. Woodward suggested during the interview that the behavior Mr. Weinstein was accused of had been at least partly to do with sex. The authors emphasized that based on their reporting, the misconduct many women accused Mr. Weinstein of -- often occurring at work, or in a work context -- was fundamentally about power.
"It's not about sex in the romantic sense," Ms. Kantor said. "I would say that part of the way it's about power is it's about work."
The audience, which packed the historic room, applauded.
Mr. Woodward also described Mr. Weinstein's behavior as "a weird foreplay," Ms. Swirling said.
In an interview Thursday afternoon, Mr. Woodward reiterated his praise for the book. He said he could not always understand what the audience members were saying, as he had tuned his hearing aids to be able to hear Ms. Kantor and Ms. Twohey on the stage.
He said he had listened to his critics over the previous day, but defended his line of questioning about sex and Mr. Weinstein as a subject worthy of further discussion.
"It's called sexual assault, sexual harassment, not power assault or power harassment. It does involve sex. So I asked the question -- you always ask the 'why' in journalism, or I try to."
He added, "I vividly remember Katherine Graham, the publisher/owner of The Washington Post, saying that we're going to ask questions, and some people aren't going to like it, but that's the business we're in."
Ms. Swirling said she felt nauseated after the talk. "Like many other survivors of sexual violence in that audience, I had a pretty visceral response," she said.
Robin Runge, a former victims-rights lawyer, said two audience members had criticized Mr. Woodward directly during the post-interview question-and-answer session.
"He was gracious about it," said Ms. Runge, who spoke to the reporters during their reporting in 2017.
Toward the end of the event, Mr. Woodward again praised "She Said," calling it "a blueprint" for how investigative journalism should be done, Ms. Runge said. The audience applauded.
The interview will be shown on C-SPAN-2 at 8 p.m. Eastern time on Thursday as part of the series "BookTV."

Texto completo: Our guide to the city's best classical music and opera happening this weekend and in the week ahead.
AIZURI QUARTET at Advent Lutheran Church (Oct. 7, 7:30 p.m.). Aaron Wunsch, the artistic director of the Music Mondays series, joins this innovative foursome, which was recently nominated for a Grammy Award. The wide-ranging program includes Hildegard of Bingen's "Columba aspexit," Caroline Shaw's "Blueprint," a quartet by Haydn and Brahms's Piano Quintet. Doors open at 6:45 p.m.; admission is free, as is the wine reception afterward.

CLEVELAND ORCHESTRA at Carnegie Hall (Oct. 4, 8 p.m.). This orchestra's music director, Franz Welser-Möst, just renewed his contract, one that now lasts, scarcely conceivable, until 2027, by which point he will have been in charge at Severance Hall for a quarter-century. Hear why in this program, pairing Mahler's Symphony No. 5, which opens with a massive funeral march, with "Trauermarsch" by Jörg Widmann, who is in Carnegie's Richard and Barbara Debs Composer's Chair this season. Yefim Bronfman is at the piano.
212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org
'MANON' at the Metropolitan Opera (Oct. 5, 8 p.m.). My colleague Joshua Barone wrote that this revival of Laurent Pelly's production may have been the "dark horse" of the Met's opening week, largely thanks to the performance of Lisette Oropesa in the title role. Oropesa is joined by Michael Fabiano as Chevalier des Grieux, Carlo Bosi as Guillot de Morfontaine, Artur Rucinski as Lescaut, Brett Polegato as De Brètigny and Kwangchul Youn as Comte des Grieux. Maurizio Benini conducts.

NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC at David Geffen Hall (Oct. 7, 7:30 p.m.). Lang Lang seems to be the go-to soloist for many orchestras when they try to swell their coffers with a gala concert, and the Philharmonic is no exception. Lang is the pianist in this all-Beethoven evening, with Jaap van Zweden on hand to conduct the Piano Concerto No. 2 and the Symphony No. 5. Earlier in the coming week at the Stanley H. Kaplan Penthouse, Laurie Anderson curates a Nightcap concert (Saturday at 10:30 p.m.), hosted by Nadia Sirota.
212-875-5656, nyphil.org
STRING ORCHESTRA OF BROOKLYN in the Green-Wood Cemetery Catacombs (Oct. 8-10, 7:30 p.m.). As part of the pioneering Angel's Share series, and accompanied by projections, Eli Spindel conducts Pärt's "Fratres," Barber's "Adagio for Strings" and Pergolesi's "Stabat Mater," with the soprano Molly Netter and the mezzo-soprano Kate Maroney. As ever, a whiskey tasting begins at 6 p.m.

Texto completo: The poet Reginald Dwayne Betts, whose new collection is "Felon," on the writer who helped him come to terms with himself.
A decade after Lucille Clifton's "Good Woman: Poems and a Memoir, 1969-1980" and "Next: New Poems" were both finalists for the 1988 Pulitzer Prize in poetry, I was a prisoner at Red Onion State Prison in Virginia, befriended by a brother with long locs, a knife stashed in the dirt on the rec yard and a copy of Michael Harper's anthology "Every Shut Eye Ain't Sleep." The man's name I've long forgotten, but Clifton's poems in that book -- all of them taken from her first four collections, also found in "Good Woman" -- would follow me in a way rivaled only by those years in a cell.
This is the thing. Back then every day teemed with violence, and the poems, like all of Clifton's poems, let me imagine even the wildest dudes around me as my brother. I read "cutting greens" as a way to understand my bid and all its contradictions. Prisons held our "bodies in an obscene embrace" and we were left, often, "thinking of everything but kinship." But at some point, you realized that "the pot is black, / the cutting board is black, / my hand, / and just for a minute / the greens roll black under the knife / and the kitchen twists dark on its spine / and i taste in my natural appetite / the bond of living things everywhere."
During those days, no one called me by my father's name. Instead, for a few years I'd been going by Shahid, christening myself with the Arabic word for witness. Everyone around me was changing his name, the chosen nom de plumes all abstract and aspirational: Divine God Allah, Wisdom Self, Double-barrel, Icepick. Then I read Clifton's "my poem." The poem was an announcement, this is who I am: "mine is already / an afrikan name."
Once, I mailed everyone I knew a copy of Clifton's "won't you celebrate with me." My mother, my aunts, a cousin. It was Mother's Day and, against prison regs, I typed the poem up again and again in the law library. I underlined the last lines, "come celebrate / with me that everyday / something has tried to kill me / and has failed." I didn't know then that mostly what I was doing when reading Clifton, more than when reading anyone else, was understanding myself.
Holding Clifton's "Collected Poems," nearly a thousand pages of verse, I realize that I am incapable of talking about a poet's work as I might a novel. Clifton's earliest poems could have been written yesterday, and her later work could have been written decades ago. Each poem is always its own world. Her poems touch the political, the personal, the spiritual. In "september song," Clifton writes of 9/11 in a way that could be about the mass shootings that seem to happen daily now. She writes, "some of us know / we have never felt safe / all of us americans / weeping." And she writes, "and this is not the time / i think / to ask who is allowed to be / american America." Reading that, I realize that then was the time, as is now. And I'm reminded mostly that Lucille Clifton helped me hear things -- helps all of those who love her work hear things that they would rather ignore.
I wept the day I met Clifton. Attending Cave Canem, a writing workshop for black poets started by Toi Derricotte and Cornelius Eady, I listened to Clifton speak with 54 other black poets. I'd gotten to the room early and sat in a plastic folding chair in the front row. That morning, I asked her a half a dozen questions, all born out of the time I spent in a cell trying to figure out what her poems meant. I wondered if "the lost baby poem" was an intentional riff on Psalm 137. I asked if the line "mine is already / an afrikan name" was a response to the Black Power rhetoric of the '60s. That morning, Clifton was nearly 70 years old. She'd been writing and publishing for more decades than I'd been alive. And still her answers to questions about poems written before I was born showed me a memory and a mind as sharp as what's reflected in the poems. I'd carried her voice around in my head with me for all those years and there she was, sitting before me, kind in a kind of way that says: This young man needs to ask these questions as much as he might need the answers. Later that day, I wept for the first time since the earliest days of my incarceration. Inconsolably. And imagine, some people wonder if poems matter.
Lucille Clifton: A Starter Kit
Two-Headed Woman
Clifton once said that she wrote small poems because she was always busy with the living, the washing of dishes and cooking of meals, raising children and being both a woman and a wife. The poems here, though short in length, fit more into these small places than most books contain as a whole.
Blessing the Boats
This book again shows that Clifton long addressed issues that still plague us today. In "the times" Clifton writes, "another child has killed a child / and i catch myself relieved that they are / white and i might understand except / that i am tired of understanding." Together, these poems do what the best collections of poetry do: cover a marathoner's ground, from dreams to racial violence to the body's general unwillingness to remain young forever. The poems are about loss, but also something else: how history and memory do sometimes propel us forward.
The Collected Poems of Lucille Clifton 1965-2010
This book has the figurative and literal heft of Clifton's poetic oeuvre. I've always found it nice to be able to hold a collection, a slim collection, and consume it slowly over time. But collected volumes remind us of the breadth of a writer's work, and also that each poem is a kind of memory to return. Flipping through Clifton's "Collected" is an American journey where the multitudinous concerns of this American life are given space to breathe in a way that is as masterly as it is singular.
The Enthusiast is an occasional column dedicated to the books we love to read and reread.

Texto completo: Los medios de comunicación viven de la publicidad pero eso no quiere decir que deben aceptar cualquier aviso que llegue a su departamento de ventas.
De acuerdo con el New York Times, el canal de noticias CNN rechazó circular dos avisos publicitarios de la campaña de reelección de Donald Trump argumentando que contenía imprecisiones.
Uno de los avisos hablaba de un intento de golpe de estado de los demócratas por su llamado a indagar la posibilidad de un juicio político. En este también se acusaba al exvicepresidente Joe Bide n de corrupción sin ninguna evidencia.
“[Biden] le prometió a Ucrania $1,000 millones si despedían al fiscal que investigaba la compañía de su hijo”, dice el narrador de la publicidad.
Lo cierto es que por ahora no hay evidencia de que Biden haya incurrido en delitos. Los avisos de Trump además atacaban a algunos de los periodistas de CNN como Don Lemmon y Chris Cuomo .
“Además de menospreciar a CNN y sus periodistas, el anuncio hace afirmaciones que han sido demostradas como falsas por varios medios de comunicación, entre ellos CNN”, dijo un portavoz de la cadena.
Los avisos de Trump eran de 30 segundos. Los puedes ver aquí.

Aloof? Unsociable? For Cats, It Could Be Just An Act

Texto completo: In the perennial battle over dogs and cats, there’s a clear public relations winner.
Dogs are man’s best friend. They’re sociable, faithful and obedient. Our relationship with cats, on the other hand, is often described as more transactional. Aloof, mysterious and independent, cats are with us only because we feed them.
Or maybe not. Researchers reported last week that cats were just as strongly bonded to us as dogs or infants, vindicating cat lovers across the land.
“I get that a lot - ‘Well, I knew that; I know that cats like to interact with me,’ ” said Kristyn Vitale, an animal behavior scientist at Oregon State University and lead author of the new study, published in Current Biology. “But in science, you don’t know that until you test it.”
Research into cat behavior has lagged that into dogs. Cats are not social animals, many scientists assumed - and not as easy to work with. But recent studies have begun to plumb the depth of cats’ social lives.
“This idea that cats don’t really care about people or respond to them isn’t holding up,” Vitale said.
In a study in 2017, Vitale and her colleagues found that a majority of cats preferred interacting with a person over eating or playing with a toy. In a 2019 study, the researchers found that cats adjusted their behavior according to how much attention a person gave them.
Other researchers have found that cats are sensitive to human emotion and mood and that cats know their names.
Scientists had arrived at conflicting findings about whether cats formed attachments to their owners, however, so Vitale and her colleagues designed a study to more explicitly test the hypothesis.
They recruited owners of 79 kittens and 38 adult cats to participate in a “secure base test,” an experiment commonly used to measure bonds that dogs and primates form with caretakers.
A similar test is also used for human infants. It is based on the theory that infants form an innate bond with caretakers that manifests as a strong desire to be near that person.
In the experiment, which lasted six minutes, cat and kitten owners entered an unfamiliar room with their animals. After two minutes, the owner left the room, leaving the cat or kitten alone - a potentially stressful experience for the animal. When the owner returned two minutes later, the researchers observed the feline’s response.
About two-thirds of cats and kittens came to greet their owners when they returned, and then went back to exploring the room, periodically returning to their owners. These animals, the researchers concluded, were securely attached to their owners, meaning they viewed them as a safe base in an unfamiliar situation.
“This may be an adaptation of the bond they would have with their parents when they were young,” Vitale said. This behavior, she added, may mean: “Everything’s OK. My owner’s back, I feel comforted and reassured, and now I can go back to exploring.”
About 35% of cats and kittens displayed insecure attachment: They avoided their owners or clung to them when they came back into the room. This does not mean that these pets have a bad relationship with their owners, Vitale said, but rather that they do not see their owners as a source of security and stress relief.
The findings mirror those found in studies of dogs and human children. In humans, 65% of infants display secure attachment to their caretakers, as do 58% of dogs.
“This result suggests a similarity in sociality in humans and companion animals,” said Atsuko Saito, a behavioral scientist at Sophia University in Tokyo, who was not involved in the new research. “Investigating this phenomenon will help us better understand the evolution of sociality in animals, including us.”
After the first round of tests, the researchers enrolled half the kittens used in the study in a training and socialization course. The other half served as a control group.
One day a week for six weeks, kittens played with one another and were trained to sit, stay and do tricks. When the course was complete, the researchers repeated the secure base test with the kittens.
They found the same results, meaning the training did not have an effect on kittens’ attachment behavior toward their owners. This indicates that once a cat forms a bond, it seems to remain stable over time, Vitale said.
In cats - as in infants and dogs - researchers still do not know all of the factors that shape the caretaker relationship, but it’s likely to be a complex mix of genetics, personality and experience.
It is possible that even more cats are securely bonded to their owners than the new study found, said Mikel Delgado, an animal behavior researcher at the University of California, Davis, who was not involved in the research.
Unlike dogs and infants, many cats spend nearly all of their time inside, so being in a new environment can be a foreign and frightening experience, she said. For some cats, a fearful response to a stressful situation may take precedence over a secure bond with an owner, so the study results may not fully capture the attachments of some cats.

The findings mirror those found in studies of dogs and human children. In humans, 65% of infants display secure attachment to their caretakers, as do 58% of dogs.
“This result suggests a similarity in sociality in humans and companion animals,” said Atsuko Saito, a behavioral scientist at Sophia University in Tokyo, who was not involved in the new research. “Investigating this phenomenon will help us better understand the evolution of sociality in animals, including us.”
After the first round of tests, the researchers enrolled half the kittens used in the study in a training and socialization course. The other half served as a control group.
One day a week for six weeks, kittens played with one another and were trained to sit, stay and do tricks. When the course was complete, the researchers repeated the secure base test with the kittens.
They found the same results, meaning the training did not have an effect on kittens’ attachment behavior toward their owners. This indicates that once a cat forms a bond, it seems to remain stable over time, Vitale said.
In cats - as in infants and dogs - researchers still do not know all of the factors that shape the caretaker relationship, but it’s likely to be a complex mix of genetics, personality and experience.
It is possible that even more cats are securely bonded to their owners than the new study found, said Mikel Delgado, an animal behavior researcher at the University of California, Davis, who was not involved in the research.
Unlike dogs and infants, many cats spend nearly all of their time inside, so being in a new environment can be a foreign and frightening experience, she said. For some cats, a fearful response to a stressful situation may take precedence over a secure bond with an owner, so the study results may not fully capture the attachments of some cats.

Texto completo: Not so long ago, congressional Republicans strenuously opposed the Russian conquest of Crimea, saw an urgent need to help Ukraine fight back and castigated the president of the United States for withholding the military aid it needed. What ever happened to those guys?
Donald Trump's July 25 phone call has ignited a controversy over whether he abused his office by trying to coerce the president of Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden. A whistleblower reported getting "information from multiple U.S. government officials that the president of the United States is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election."
Trump's effort to obtain incriminating material about Biden does not seem to concern GOP members of Congress. That isn't surprising. What is surprising is how indifferent they are to Trump's betrayal of a country whose territorial integrity and independence they once championed so fervently.
Since Vladimir Putin's troops seized and annexed Crimea in 2014, fighting has gone on in eastern Ukraine between the Ukrainian military and Russian-supported separatists. The long-simmering conflict has left some 13,000 dead and put heavy pressure on the Kyiv government. On Tuesday, Ukraine and Russia reached an agreement to hold an election in the contested area, which critics in Ukraine denounced as capitulation and which may or may not lead to a peace settlement.
At the outset, Republicans pushed to provide Ukraine with the weapons it needed to fight back. Barack Obama was willing to provide an assortment of equipment and supplies but balked at delivering "lethal aid" -- rifles, ammunition, mortars, grenade launchers, anti-tank missiles and the like. He was of the view that such aid would only increase the bloodshed of a war that Ukraine couldn't win.
For his policy, Obama was pilloried on Capitol Hill. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said Obama was "afraid of confronting the Russians." Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said, "I would be sending arms to the Ukrainian army." Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire described Obama's refusal as "shameful."
In 2014, when the GOP controlled the House, Speaker John Boehner invited President Petro Poroshenko to address a joint session of Congress, where he pleaded for lethal military aid. "One cannot win the war with blankets," he said. "Even more, we cannot keep the peace with a blanket."
Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, who blamed Putin's invasion on "President Obama's trembling inaction," was among those urging lethal aid to Kyiv. When Trump approved the shipment in 2017, Cotton praised this "break from the failed Obama era policies to make Russia pay a cost for its aggression."
By that logic, Trump's suspension of military aid to Ukraine (which he finally allowed in September) was a revival of Obama's failed approached and a gift to the Kremlin. It deprived the Ukrainians of help they were expecting and put in doubt our future willingness to help.
But the heartfelt sympathy for this beleaguered country has somehow dried up. The once-fierce Cotton has gone soft, ignoring the needs of the Ukrainian military so he can obsess over bogus allegations. On Sept. 26, his office put out excerpts of his remarks in radio and TV interviews. They were all about the Bidens -- with not a single expression of concern for the Ukrainians on the receiving end of Russian bombs and bullets.
If congressional Republicans were not shocked by the administration's reversal, Ukrainians were. "It was a total surprise," Pavlo Klimkin, who was foreign minister when word reached Kyiv in August, told The New York Times. They were also mystified. "If the United States harbored concerns about any misuse of the aid by Ukraine," reported the Times, senior Ukrainian officials "said they had never heard about them."
In fact, they and everyone else had heard just the opposite. The Department of Defense recently made a full examination of Ukraine's efforts to combat corruption and other ills, and gave the government a seal of approval. In May, the department formally certified that progress. In August, a senior Pentagon official told Politico, "The department has reviewed the foreign assistance package and supports it."
Corruption in Ukraine did not suddenly become known in July. It has been present and well-known all along. Yet GOP members (and many Democrats) favored lethal aid for its war with Russia anyway. For Trump to suddenly make it a litmus test was totally at odds with the long-standing position of most congressional Republicans.
When Obama resisted, they accused him of undermining Ukraine to appease Putin. Today, we find, they are willing to turn their backs on Ukraine to appease Trump.

Texto completo: Irony is officially dead. After decades of systemically overthrowing the leaders of other countries, the U.S. may overthrow itself. That's essentially what impeachment is, and that's what U.S. President Donald Trump now faces.
It all started with a still-anonymous whistleblower who is reportedly a longtime member of the intelligence community. The whistleblower's complaint passed muster with the Trump-appointed inspector general of the intelligence community, Michael Atkinson, who not only found it credible but also urgent enough for Congress to be alerted.
The complaint pertains to a July call between Trump and newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. After Zelenskiy thanked Trump for America's "great support in the area of defense," Trump responded by saying, "I would like you to do us a favor." (At the time, the Trump administration was withholding Congress-approved military aid from Ukraine.)
Trump then instructed Zelenskiy to engage with Attorney General Bill Barr and with Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, who has long been making trips to Ukraine as a "consultant."
Trump also asked Zelenskiy to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a Democratic presidential candidate. Biden's son, Hunter, landed on the board of a Ukrainian energy company in the immediate wake of U.S.-backed regime change in Ukraine. The company, Burisma Holdings, had long been suspected of corruption.
One of the ways that the U.S. surveils foreign multinationals is by threatening corruption charges under U.S. law, then negotiating an arrangement that involves a compliance monitor reporting to U.S. authorities. After the U.S. helped overthrow Ukraine's pro-Russian president in 2014, the installation of Hunter Biden on the Burisma Holdings board as part of "anti-corruption" measures fulfilled that purpose. If Trump has a problem with this, then it's the practice itself that he needs to target.
Ukraine isn't the only country where Trump's meddling threatens to backfire on him. According to the New York Times, just weeks before Trump hosted Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison for the second state dinner of his presidency, Trump called Morrison to request Australia's help in investigating the origins of the Mueller inquiry.
These incidents raise the question of what else was discussed between Trump and world leaders that might help account for the sort of puzzling behavior that Trump has exhibited - perhaps most notably, his inexplicably fervent support of Saudi Arabia.
According to the whistleblower's complaint, Trump's call with the Ukrainian president was "loaded into a separate electronic system that is otherwise used to store and handle classified information of an especially sensitive nature," rather than into one typically reserved for such matters. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, both of whom face criminal charges in America for breaching secrecy laws, have talked about the abuse of the secret classification system by government officials to hide wrongdoing. The actions of this administration are only serving to make their point.
Trump has referred to the whistleblower, who went through official government channels, as a "fake whistleblower." Snowden responded on Twitter: "Can you believe that the president will criticize you for exposing their wrongdoing whether or not you 'followed proper channels'? I mean gosh it's almost as if their concern was never about the law so much as suppressing credible reports of unethical activities."
He has a point. While Trump is putting himself in political jeopardy with his reckless behavior, he might just end up exposing the entire system.

Texto completo: On her New York City law enforcement beat, Ali Watkins mines CompStat for trends and crowdsourcing for breaking news. You can, too.
How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Ali Watkins, who covers crime and law enforcement in New York, discussed the tech she's using.
What are your go-to tech tools for work?
I'll be the first to admit: I'm a curmudgeon when it comes to tech. I like printing out and reading documents (and recycling them!) and mapping out stories on paper. But some organizational tech tools have become critical for me to keep track of stories.
I was a begrudging, late adopter of Slack, but it's been a godsend in the midst of breaking news. We can immediately create channels and pull in coverage lines for fast-moving stories like Jeffrey Epstein's death.
My reporting gets organized in the Google suite: Docs, Sheets and Drive. I'm probably too millennial with voice recording -- I record interviews on my iPhone, email the voice memos directly to myself and use iTunes to review them. I carry a recorder with me in case of an emergency, but rarely use it.
As far as reporting on the police and the city, there is a whole library of tech and data tools that I use. One of the most valuable is CompStat, which is the Police Department's crime data hub. I've never seen such a user-friendly police data tool at any other department. Anyone has access to the CompStat website, which is produced by the department (and therefore needs to be taken with appropriate skepticism) but, on its face, is a wealth of data and story ideas.
If you want to compare shooting rates in a specific precinct in the Bronx over a decade, CompStat gets you those numbers in seconds. It saves us so much time on research, and has provided us with story leads and ideas. For example, if you start to see clusters of a certain crime in a precinct or neighborhood, that could be an interesting story.
I also use the Citizen app, which is essentially a crowdsourcing tool for crime and emergency incidents. We don't rely on Citizen to report facts, but it becomes important for us during breaking news, when initial wire reports are often wrong or confusing. Citizen allows anyone with a user profile to post what he or she is seeing, and even live-stream from a crime scene.
Say a report comes across the wire that a shooting happened in Brooklyn. Details are sparse: multiple shots fired, one victim in unknown condition. Someone could be dead -- or someone's arm might have just been grazed. I'll check Citizen and see if anyone is streaming from the scene to decide if I should flag for the desk and head to the scene, or just monitor the situation remotely.
I do keep an old-school police scanner at home (passed down from my editor, Jim McKinley). Sometimes I'll turn it on and listen to traffic, usually for nearby precincts. But it's pretty clunky and not very efficient.
How does New York City's criminal justice system use technology? And how is it changing?
The city's embrace of tech is manic. There are elements of New York's criminal justice system that are up to date and streamlined, like electronic court records and crime data. CompStat, for example, was a watershed development in data policing.
But police use of technology is fraught. We're not talking about a private entity embracing a new interoffice communication system. We're talking about a very powerful institution -- the New York City Police Department -- using extremely powerful technology in ways that affect people's lives (and have a disproportionate impact on brown and black lives).
In some of the cases we know about, like the N.Y.P.D.'s use of facial recognition software, the technology is too new to inspire full confidence, and it is so new that the tech industry isn't even sure what a coherent law enforcement policy should look like. It's fertile reporting ground, but it should give pause to both departments and the people who are covering them.
You've written about the mafia, high-profile criminal suspects, celebrities gone awry. Is tech increasingly figuring in the cases that you cover?
The importance of tech is magnified in these kinds of incidents, but it's probably an extension of how tech is increasingly having a role in every story.
As soon as I get a name associated with a crime, I scrub social media. If a victim, did he or she post anything before the crime that would give us a lead? Did friends post any cryptic Instagram story, or tweet something strange? What about perpetrators?
Sometimes it's still surprising to me how much of a narrative we can piece together just by going through people's social media accounts. In many cases, we're looking at the same open-source material the police are looking at.
What are some of your tech best practices for protecting the confidentiality of sources?
Burner phones are the only way I ever feel remotely confident, and even those aren't fail-safe. You could do everything right with a burner -- buy it in cash, register it under a different name, keep any identifying information off it -- and the second it plugs into the Wi-Fi in the office, it's toast.
My best advice is to go as old school as you can. Meet sensitive sources in person. Before you go, look at everything you're carrying, everything you're wearing, and don't take anything that has electronic components. (Smart watch? Take it off.) Don't Uber. If you have to drive, take a cab and pay in cash. (License plate readers? E-ZPass? Don't chance it.) Never pay with a credit card.
Reverse engineer every sensitive meeting: If I were an institution and wanted to find out about this, what electronic trail would I be able to follow? Nothing is too paranoid.
Outside of work, what tech do you love, and why?
My list is pretty short (give me a Bluetooth speaker and a record player and I'll be happy), but I just recently downloaded the language app Babel to learn French. I'm late to the language app world, but what a game changer. I know it's not perfect, but the Babel lessons are approachable and simple. I love that I can knock out a lesson on my morning commute.
How do you unplug from tech?
I love unplugging. Everyone should do it, as often and responsibly as possible. I make semiregular efforts to go places where there is zero cell service, just so I'm not tempted to check Twitter.
I'll use GPS to get wherever I'm going, and I use an offline GPS tracker when I'm out somewhere remote alone (a request from my mother), but that's it. I've actually found that unplugging helps clarify my reporting instincts. It's such a critical reminder that as journalists, so much of our worldview is shaped by the weird media bubble the algorithms create for us. Getting outside of that can be productive.
In Tech We're Using, Times journalists give us a peek into the technology they love and use for work and life.

Texto completo: President Trump's political advisers have been working for months to get states to adjust their plans to ensure that nothing disrupts next year's convention.
President Trump's political advisers have concluded a monthslong effort to tighten the rules for choosing delegates to the Republican National Convention, all but ensuring there are no dissenting speeches at the gathering of party officials in Charlotte next year.
On Tuesday, state Republican parties submitted to the national committee their delegate allocation plans, the methods by which they will choose and bind delegates who attend the convention as their representatives.
In 37 states and territories, there have been changes to the rules that will all but stamp out the possibility of any raucous divide on the convention floor. Those kinds of schisms have plagued party conventions in years when a Republican incumbent went on to lose his re-election bid, Republican officials said. Mr. Trump himself confronted an effort to strip him of delegates in 2016.
The new delegate guidelines are the culmination of a 10-month effort by Trump advisers to strengthen the president's grip on the Republican Party ahead of the general election. It means that even if the three candidates challenging Mr. Trump in the Republican primary gain vote shares, they almost certainly won't translate into speeches or jeers from supporters of these candidates when the convention is taking place.
The plans also serve as a reminder that even as Mr. Trump faces the prospect of an impeachment vote, his campaign is making every effort to assure a smooth path to the nomination and a convention that resembles something of a coronation for the president.
"Looking at history, we kind of came to the realization that this stuff matters for the general election," said Justin Clark, senior counsel to the campaign.
Since the beginning of the year, Mr. Trump's advisers have placed a premium on avoiding intraparty conflicts that have plagued previous Republican incumbents and challengers alike.
That included Mr. Trump, who faced his own challenge in 2016 after his improbable rise to become the de facto nominee. There was an effort to strip delegates from Mr. Trump and give them to Senator Ted Cruz, a Republican from Texas and the last man standing against Mr. Trump in the primaries.
That challenge failed, but it added to a frisson of drama on the convention floor. And it left a lingering impression on the president and his advisers about what to do differently to avoid a repeat in 2020.
Bill Stepien, a senior political adviser to the president, Mr. Clark and other campaign officials have spent most of this year working with state Republican officials either to change rules or to push for party chairs who are favorable to Mr. Trump.
Republican parties in states like Massachusetts -- a blue state that is nonetheless delegate-rich at party conventions because of its large population -- have changed their rules so that any candidate who wins more than 50 percent of the vote in the primary captures all the delegates.
New York, the president's home state and another with a large population, has a new Republican Party chairman, Nick Langworthy, who is viewed favorably by the national committee and the White House. There, too, the rules now allow for a winner-take-all delegate award if a candidate clears 50 percent of the vote.
Republicans are trying to avoid the conflicts that arose at conventions such as the one in 1992, when Patrick J. Buchanan challenged the incumbent Republican president, George Bush, for the nomination. Mr. Buchanan didn't gather significant support in most of the primaries. But he rolled into the party's convention at the Astrodome in Houston with enough support to draw cheers during a thunderous speech about the "culture war" being waged for the soul of the nation.
In 1976, President Gerald Ford faced a nominating challenge from Ronald Reagan. The incumbent found himself wooing delegates to lock them up at the convention, using enticements like offering rides aboard Air Force One.
For both Mr. Bush and Mr. Ford, the primary challenges helped expose weaknesses that were exploited in the general election. Despite Mr. Trump's high popularity in polls of Republican voters, his campaign is seeking to avoid any signs of discord. That includes a situation like the one Mitt Romney faced in 2012, when he was forced to contend with changes sought by delegates supporting Ron Paul.
There are other measures the Trump team has taken. Five states have canceled their primaries, including South Carolina, in moves that will further prevent his challengers -- the former congressmen Joe Walsh and Mark Sanford, and the former Massachusetts governor William Weld -- from gaining traction.
But it is the delegate rules and changes to parties at the state level that the campaign has spent most of its energies on this year.
"This campaign has used this as an offensive opportunity for the president," Mr. Stepien said. He described 2016 as "a wake-up call for a lot of people in terms of how the delegate process works."
"Good campaigns analyze what they could have done better," he said.

Texto completo: Frustrated that responses to emergency calls took too long in Bedford-Stuyvesant, he started a volunteer ambulance corps, and it's been nimble.
When a 7-year-old girl was hit by a car one day in 1988 in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, it took more than 30 minutes for an ambulance to arrive. When it did, her uncle, James Robinson Jr., climbed in for the ride to the hospital.
The ambulance was equipped with lifesaving equipment, he said, but "the attendant didn't even know how to turn on the oxygen." His niece, Cynthia Lomax, died along the way.
The incident prompted Mr. Robinson to start a volunteer ambulance corps in Bedford-Stuyvesant that has answered calls ever since, cutting response times to only a few minutes. The group, one of more than 30 volunteer emergency service agencies in New York City today and one of nearly that many certified to give basic life support, has also trained more than 1,000 emergency medical technicians.
Mr. Robinson, who was known as Rocky, died on Friday at 79. The cause was heart failure, said a son, Antoine Robinson.
When he started the corps, Mr. Robinson had a day job that made him well aware of a devastating crack epidemic that was ravaging poor and working-class neighborhoods in New York City: He was an ambulance driver for the Emergency Medical Service of the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation.
Mr. Robinson said his mission with the corps was not to replace E.M.S. but to add to the ranks of those qualified to help in emergencies. "They never thought black guys would want to save lives," he said in an interview with The New York Times in 2017, without specifying who "they" were. "It's about neighbor helping neighbor. I don't see the color of the skin."
The corps trained volunteers -- young people Mr. Robinson affectionately called "vollies" -- to be emergency medical technicians. Once they passed state examinations, the volunteers could take a patient to a hospital and provide basic first aid along the way.
At first he and a friend with whom he started the corps listened to police and fire department radios and went to addresses they heard on the air -- accident scenes or apartments where sick people needed help. They answered the calls in their own cars.
Before long they got an ambulance, the first of several that the corps would operate. Mr. Robinson recalled in 2017 that on the first day with the first ambulance, the corps treated 10 people at the scene of a fire. On the second day, corps members delivered a baby.
Dr. Alexander E. Kuehl, who was the medical director of the city's Emergency Medical Service and a vice president of the Health and Hospitals Corporation when the corps began, said in 2017 that the corps had opened a pathway to E.M.S.
"That was the catch about E.M.S. when I got there: You had to have a driver's license and your E.M.T. card to join E.M.S.," Dr. Kuehl said. "I needed to have a way for ghetto kids to get that card like the kids on suburban Long Island" -- where volunteer fire departments are entrenched in many towns and villages -- and provide training.
Over the years, the corps became something of a labor of love, with protégés teaching classes for those seeking to join the ranks. "The corps, we don't get much money," Mr. Robinson's son Reggie said in 2017, "and he couldn't afford to give me a salary. A lot of times, that place runs off of Pop's pension."
Mr. Robinson retired from E.M.S. in 2000 with the rank of captain but continued to oversee the corps, which is still in operation.
In addition to his sons Antoine and Reggie, his survivors include his wife, Vernice, and many other children.
At one point Mr. Robinson underwent a kidney transplant, and the donor was an adopted son who was part of the corps. In 2017 he was injured at the West Indian-American Day Parade, a Labor Day celebration in Brooklyn that has often been marred by violence. When a 22-year-old man was hit by gunfire on a side street, the crowd surged toward where Mr. Robinson, by then in a wheelchair, had positioned himself.
"Guess who they trampled?" Mr. Robinson said. "Me. They were waving 'Rocky! Rocky!' They all know me. I was trying to get people to save lives and nearly lost mine. Instead of running to me for help, they trampled me. They crushed the whole foot." It had to be amputated.
James Matthew Robinson Jr. was born on July 15, 1940, in Marietta, N.C. His parents moved to Brooklyn when he was a child. He graduated from Eastern District High School in the Williamsburg section and joined the Army. He served in the 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment, known as the Old Guard, and Mr. Robinson often recalled standing guard when Jacqueline Kennedy visited President John F. Kennedy's grave at Arlington National Cemetery.
Back in Brooklyn after the Army, Mr. Robinson sometimes needed urgent medical help himself -- even before the West Indian parade incident. Once, in 1992, he went into cardiac arrest. The emergency team that was dispatched included several people he had helped train.
Antoine Robinson said that in the emergency room his father was treated by one Dr. Timothy Sutton. Dr. Sutton had been in the corps' first class and had later gone to medical school.

Christine Blasey Ford's lawyers see progress in the #MeToo movement

Texto completo: In the two years since the #MeToo movement exploded and the year since Christine Blasey Ford made her allegations against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, speaking out about sexual assault and harassment has not become easier for victims, one of Ford's lawyers said.
“It still requires an enormous amount of courage to come forward, whether you're doing it on a very public stage like Dr. Ford or even privately in your own workplace," said attorney Lisa Banks. “Because what we have always seen and what we continue to see is retaliation, backlash, threats, and intimidation against women who stand up and accuse powerful men of sexual misconduct."
What has changed, though, is the world's receptivity to such stories, as women are increasingly being heard.
Witness the action Banks and her law partner, Debra Katz, spurred in recent weeks for the women who blew the whistle on shortlived New England Patriot Antonio Brown and longtime tenor Plácido Domingo.
“I do believe that the movement has done a great deal to educate companies, employers, etc., about how corrosive it is to ignore these kind of credible allegations because the person is perceived to be a high wage earner, mission critical, too important to fail," said Katz. “People are being held accountable and that's a good thing."
On Thursday, Banks and Katz will receive “leadership awards" for their pro bono work for Ford during last year's Senate Judiciary Committee hearingproceeding Kavanaugh's confirmation. The awards will be presented at the annual fund-raiser of the Victim Rights Law Centerin Boston, which provides free legal representation to help victims of rape and sexual assault to rebuild their lives.
The lawyers, partners at Katz, Marshall & Banks in Washington, D.C., worked behind the scenes with Ford to negotiate the terms of her appearance before the committee and to prepare her for her testimony. A newly published book, “She Said," by the New York Times reporters whose story about Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein launched the #MeToo movement, reveals how hesitant Ford was to come forward and how gently the lawyers guided her.
“We always told Christine that whatever she decided, we would support her and if she decided to go forward we would fight like hell for her. But if she decided that she couldn't, we respected that," said Katz. “So, it was a roller-coaster ride. But ultimately, it was just a portrait of courage that she did get herself from someone who felt like she could never, ever do this, to someone who for four hours testified under oath, and answered every question that was asked of her and did it without rancor, and did it honestly and with respect for the process."
Banks said she believed that Ford made a difference by “standing up in front of the world and sharing that information and being so brave and courageous."
“[Kavanaugh] may be sitting on the Supreme Court, and maybe that was a foregone conclusion, but it was still an important moment for our society in terms of having that conversation about what is and is not acceptable," she said.
In the two years since Weinstein was accused of serial sexual harassment and sexual misconduct — a case in which they also were involved, representing The Weinstein Company whistle-blower Irwin Reiter — Banks and Katz have handled a litany of cases, from a billionaire philanthropist accused of leveraging donations for sex, to a congressman harassing an aide he called his “soul mate."
The vibrancy of the #MeToo movement has not dulled, Katz said, pointing to the actions taken by the Metropolitan Opera and the NFL on cases involving two of her firm's clients just last week.
The NFL launched an investigation into Brown after a female artist told Sports Illustrated that Brown behaved sexually inappropriately when he hired her to paint a mural in his home — and sent threatening messages with photos of her children on a group text to her and his friends after she reported it. That followed another woman's lawsuit, filed a day after Brown was signed by the New England Patriots, accusing Brown of rape and sexual assault.
“They took action," Banks said of the NFL. “The Patriots then chose to release him. And I suppose we can quibble with whether they should have hired him in the first instance or they felt like, well, he's going to be penalized and not be able to play so it's easy for them to do. But they did it. And I think what we've seen in years past is that the NFL and the teams in the NFL haven't always done the right thing."
Last Wednesday, Banks and the artist met with NFL officials, who are continuing an investigation into Brown, though he is no longer playing in the league. The NFL also responded to his tweet that appeared to encourage fan violence against the Sports Illustrated writer who broke the story, Banks said.
Also last week, Katz was representing Patricia Wulf, one of two women who attached their names to accusations of sexual misconduct against Domingo, the renowned opera singer. Twenty women had spoken to the Associated Press about him, but the Met's general manager Peter Gelb told chorus and orchestra members all the accusers were unnamed; that they had not come forward to other news outlets; and that the AP's reporting lacked “corroboration," National Public Radio reported.
“That might have been an argument that could have been made pre-October 2017," Katz said, pointing to the launch of the #MeToo movement. “But companies just can't do that anymore. To say, well we're giving him a pass, he's denied it, and the 20 women who have come forward with a very similar account, they can't be trusted? We're just beyond the days where that's going to work." Within days, Domingo was out.
Banks and Katz have been practicing together for nearly 20 years and spun off their own firm with partner David Marshall in 2006.
Banks, who grew up in Canton, said that she originally wanted to be a player for the Red Sox; her father finally had to break it to her that they didn't take girls. “I had to be a civil rights lawyer instead to right those wrongs," she jokes.
Founded in 2003, the Victim Rights Law Center was the first nonprofit law firm in the country dedicated to the legal needs of sexual assault survivors, providing assistance with civil matters like housing — for instance, helping someone break a lease on an apartment so she does not need to remain living where she was raped.
Past honorees include Kristin Gibbons Feden, who prosecuted comedian Bill Cosby; feminist icon Gloria Steinem; and attorney and professor Anita Hill, who spoke out about sexual harassment in 1991; US Representative Ayanna Pressley; actress and activist Ashley Judd; and The Boston Globe Spotlight Team.

State Senate to investigate NJ Transit

Texto completo: Whispers of NJ Transit fare hikes are, in part, the reason the state Senate is launching an investigation into the struggling agency, the future investigating committee's chair said Tuesday.
"We charge more for a commuter system than any other area around here and now we're talking about charging more and it isn't working right — that's not a formula for success," said Senate President Stephen Sweeney, who said the investigation would likely begin after the elections in late November or early December. "The time of talking about things is long past and it's really time to figure it out, come up with solutions and move forward."
Sweeney will be joined on the committee by three Democratic colleagues in the senate — Sandra Cunningham, Patrick Diegnan and Majority Leader Loretta Weinberg — and several Republicans who will be named at a later date to join the group.
The committee will hold public hearings, round-table discussions, conduct site visits and, if needed, Sweeney said, a subpoena for information or testimony.
"We're just going to keep a focus on this, a very high-profile focus on this until we have a solution," Sweeney said. "It's time to stop talking about how good we are ... because the commuters I've been talking to don't feel that way."
NJ Transit spokeswoman Nancy Snyder said in an email the agency looks forward to working with the Legislature, and highlighted recent changes at the agency including accelerating work on a federally-mandated braking system, hiring engineers and drivers, and advancing stalled capital projects.
"While there is still much to be done, NJ Transit has made notable progress investing in recruiting, infrastructure and new vehicles, while enhancing safety for riders," Snyder said. "We look forward to discussing these issues with the Legislature in the months ahead as we continue improving the quality of public transportation throughout the state.
Riders had mixed reactions to the news.
"This is great news. Let's just hope this NJ Senate committee has teeth," Bobby Amirshahi, a rider on the Morris & Essex line, said in a Facebook comment.
Fellow rider, David Danto, threw in his suggestion to get results.
"Pass a state law that has the NJ Transit executives and management earn a basic salary, with incentives tied to train reliability and on-time performance," Danto said. "With skin in the game there would finally be improvements."
Murphy's law Fixing the embattled agency has been a central talking point of Gov. Phil Murphy since he was elected in 2017.
The governor issued an audit of the agency, which released its report about a year ago, signed a reform bill in December requiring changes at NJ Transit, and has held several press conferences this year touting the agency's improvements.
"Make no mistake: this administration is doing the long, difficult work of putting NJ Transit on the path to recovery, and Governor Murphy will not stop until New Jersey commuters have the world-class transportation agency they deserve," Murphy spokesman Dan Bryan said in a statement.
"We welcome the Legislature's scrutiny and look forward to the discussion of their budgets that were negotiated with Governor Christie and sent to his desk, which reduced state funding to the agency by as much as 90 percent."
Years of underfunded budgets that required the agency to raid its capital monies and unreliable funding from different sources has been at the heart of NJ Transit's problems, an issue highlighted frequently by politicians, agency officials and advocates for commuters.
This year the state Legislature approved a $50 million net increase for NJ Transit during budget negotiations in May, up from the $25 million originally proposed by Murphy.
Sweeney said a "dedicated source of funding is crucial," but admitted nothing concrete is in the works to make that happen yet.
Weinberg said earlier this month that this issue should be addressed once the agency's new board members are appointed to their positions. Murphy gave his list of board nominations to the Senate in March, but they have yet to be confirmed.
The announcement of the investigation comes four days after The New York Times published an article calling NJ Transit "the worst commuter train in America."
NJ Transit trains are four times as likely to be cancelled as Long Island Railroad and Metro North trains, and NJ Transit's accident and breakdown rate is worse than other major railroads, according to The New York Times analysis.
A father and teenage son were injured in a car accident with a NJ Transit train on Main St in River Edge, N.J. Thursday Sept. 19, 2019 according to River Edge Police Lt. Mike Walker. They were extricated from the car by River Edge Fire Department with the assistance of Oradell and New Milford departments.

Texto completo: DALLAS -- A former Dallas police officer who shot her unarmed black neighbor in his own apartment was found guilty of murder Tuesday in an unusual and high-profile case that dealt with issues of race, policing and mistaken identity.
What happened
The former officer, Amber Guyger, who is white, was charged in the death of her 26-year-old neighbor, Botham Shem Jean, after she accidentally went to the wrong floor of their apartment complex, entered the unit directly above hers and fatally shot him last year.
Guyger claimed she thought she was entering her own apartment and was acting in self-defense against an intruder.
The jury rejected that argument and returned a rare murder conviction against a police officer who, in this case, was off-duty but in uniform.
After the judge read the verdict, Jean's mother raised her fists in the air. "God is good," she said.
Why it matters
The shooting and its aftermath in September 2018 ignited protests and calls for justice, with demonstrations outside police headquarters and inside City Hall. At a time when other
police officers have been cleared of
wrongdoing in the deaths of unarmed black men, Guyger was arrested several days after the shooting on a charge of manslaughter, then released from jail the same day. After weeks of community tensions and accusations of preferential treatment for the police, a grand jury came back with the charge of murder.
In some ways, the case poses a contrast to other high-pro-file police shootings, because it involves an off-duty officer who returned home in uniform and shot her neighbor in the safety of his own home. Still, the outcome was being closely followed among activists for police accountability.
What's next
Guyger faces a sentence of between 5 and 99 years.

Texto completo: President Trump's attacks on the whistleblower at the center of the impeachment inquiry aren't a surprise to Edward Snowden. The individual whose revelations sparked a global debate about surveillance has some experience in revealing explosive government secrets.
Snowden said in a wide-ranging podcast interview, launched Monday night, with the American Civil Liberties Union that Trump's attacks on the whistleblower's credibility highlight a broader, political playbook used to intimidate people who are considering exposing government wrongdoing. Snowden, exiled in Moscow after revealing a far-reaching government surveillance program, said in the interview that attention should remain on the facts and proof behind the exposure - and not on where the information originated.
"Whenever power faces some kind of opposition, they immediately try to change the conversation into: Who are you? How dare you! And get people talking about who brought this forward instead of what was brought forward," Snowden told ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero. "And that's why we need processes to account for that right."
The interview marks Snowden's most extensive public comments on the whistleblower at the center of the Trump impeachment inquiry since that person's complaint became public last week. The revelations have sparked perhaps the greatest debate about whistleblowing since Snowden's own decision to release a trove of government documents to the news media more than six years ago detailing the extent of the National Security Agency's data collection practices. And they could have far-reaching consequences for whether whistleblowers feel comfortable coming forward in the future.
Many civil liberties advocates view Snowden as a famous precursor to the anonymous individual who filed a detailed report with the intelligence community's inspector general alleging that Trump inappropriately asked the Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden and his son. But others don't think Snowden fits the definition of whistleblower, given the fact that his findings were leaked to the news media and the U.S. government considers him a traitor.
Snowden defined the word in his new book, "Permanent Record."
"A 'whistleblower,' in my definition, is a person who through hard experience has concluded that their life inside an institution has become incompatible with the principles developed in - and the loyalty owed to - the greater society outside it, to which that institution should be accountable," he writes. "This person knows that they can't remain inside the institution, and knows that the institution can't or won't be dismantled. Reforming the institution might be possible, however, so they blow the whistle and disclose the information to bring public pressure to bear."
Snowden's revelations launched global scrutiny of government and private-sector data collection that resonates today. And the world's most famous privacy advocate hasn't been shy about drawing comparisons between himself and the whistleblower who claims that Trump misused his office for personal gain.
The whistleblower in the Trump matter was an intelligence official who followed laws for reporting potential wrongdoing. The New York Times reported last week that the CIA official first anonymously reported information about the phone call and alleged coverup by the Trump administration to the CIA's top lawyer. The lawyer shared those concerns with the Justice Department and the White House. Around that time, the official separately filed the whistleblower complaint with the intelligence community's inspector general.
The ACLU is pushing lawmakers to consider stronger whistleblower protections as The Washington Post's Matt Zapotosky and John Wagner reported that there are only limited protections available to people in the intelligence community who report government wrongdoing.
In his case, Snowden, a former CIA employee and NSA contractor, instead opted to leak classified government secrets to journalists (including Post reporters). Federal prosecutors have charged Snowden with espionage, and since 2013 he has lived in Russia. Snowden explained in the ACLU interview that leaking to reporters was the best option when the system failed, especially when officials to whom he would have been reporting his concerns were responsible for creating the programs he exposed.
"And this is where we have seen time and time again that when you go through these proper channels, as you call them, they don't resolve the problem," he said. "Rather, they're a kind of trap where whistleblowers go into and then they're flushed from the system. The complaints are buried, the programs are shored up and made even more secret. And the person who reported them has their life destroyed. They lose their career. In some cases, they lose their freedom, their family. These are not hypotheticals."
Snowden predicts that the whistleblower in the Trump matter will be okay in the end.
"They're going to be attacked," Snowden said. "They're going to face retaliation. But I think they'll be protected because they're not indicting the system. They're indicting a man."

Texto completo: El presidente Donald Trump habría sugerido medidas ilegales para detener la llegada de inmigrantes a Estados Unidos el pasado marzo.
Un informe del New York Times revela las discusiones que tuvo Trump con varios de sus asesores por los días en que la caravana de migrantes se instalaba en la frontera con el objetivo de pedir asilo político.
El reporte describe a un Trump desesperado y agresivo con sus asesores, entre ellos su yerno Jared Kuschner.
“¡Me están haciendo ver como un idiota!” , habría gritado Trump en una reunión. “Hice campaña con este tema. Es mi asunto”.
El presidente llegó a sugerir un cierre total de la frontera pero sus asesores le advirtieron que la medida dejaría a atrapados a turistas estadounidense en México y crearía un caos económico. La entonces secretaria de Seguridad Nacional Kirstjen Nielsen añadió que las solicitudes de asilo podían seguir en marcha en un eventual cierre de los pasos fronterizos.
El presidente rechazó las advertencias y sugirió medidas más extremas como disparar a los inmigrantes si tiraban piedras, algo que se conoció públicamente en ese momento. Los asesores le dijeron que eso era ilegal. Trump después pidió balear en las piernas a los inmigrantes para retrasar su arribo a la frontera.
El artículo menciona el momento en el que Trump decide atacar a México con aranceles . También tiene detalles del despido de Nielsen, quien le recordó al presidente que no podía construir un muro de concreto ya que todo estaba contratado con las barrerar de acero.
Trump terminaría resignado a su suerte y en los meses siguientes se dedicó a criticar las leyes de inmigración de Estados Unidos.

Resumen: WASHINGTON — Attorney General William Barr has held private meetings overseas with foreign intelligence officials seeking their help in a Justice Department inquiry that President Donald Trump hopes will discredit U.S. intelligence agencies’ examination of possible connections between Russia and members of the Trump campaign during the 2016 election. Current and former intelligence and law enforcement officials expressed frustration and alarm Monday that the head of the Justice Department was taking such a direct role in re-examining what they view as conspiracy theories and baseless allegations of misconduct in the three-year-old election. [...]Barr has already made overtures to British intelligence officials, and last week the attorney general traveled to Italy, where he and Durham met senior Italian government officials and Barr asked the Italians to assist Durham, according to one person familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive issue.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Attorney General William Barr has held private meetings overseas with foreign intelligence officials seeking their help in a Justice Department inquiry that President Donald Trump hopes will discredit U.S. intelligence agencies’ examination of possible connections between Russia and members of the Trump campaign during the 2016 election.
And Trump has assisted with Barr’s efforts by calling other countries’ leaders, including the Australian prime minister in a recent phone call.
Justice Department and White House spokesmen, as well as an Australian government spokesman, confirmed and defended the efforts after The Washington Post and The New York Times reported them, citing people familiar with the matter.
Barr’s personal involvement is likely to stoke further criticism from Democrats pursuing impeachment that he is helping the Trump administration use executive branch powers to augment investigations aimed primarily at the president’s adversaries.
But the high-level Justice Department focus on intelligence operatives’ conduct matches Trump’s and conservatives’ "investigate the investigators" rallying cry. Barr has voiced his own concerns, telling lawmakers in April that he believed "spying did occur" when it came to the U.S. investigation of the Trump campaign.
The direct involvement of the nation’s top law enforcement official shows the priority Barr places on the investigation being conducted by John Durham, the U.S. attorney in Connecticut, who has been assigned the sensitive task of reviewing U.S. intelligence work surrounding the 2016 election and its aftermath.
Current and former intelligence and law enforcement officials expressed frustration and alarm Monday that the head of the Justice Department was taking such a direct role in re-examining what they view as conspiracy theories and baseless allegations of misconduct in the three-year-old election.
Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec did not name the countries in her statement. But Barr has already made overtures to British intelligence officials, and last week the attorney general traveled to Italy, where he and Durham met senior Italian government officials and Barr asked the Italians to assist Durham, according to one person familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive issue.
It was not Barr’s first trip to Italy to meet intelligence officials, the person said. The Trump administration has made similar requests of Australia, said people who discussed the interactions on the condition of anonymity.
In a recent phone call, Trump urged Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison to provide assistance to the ongoing Justice Department inquiry, the people said. Trump made the request at Barr’s urging, they said. The Trump phone call was first reported by The New York Times and later confirmed by an Australian government spokesman who said his government was ready to "help shed further light on the matters under investigation," Bloomberg reported.
Trump administration officials defended the moves as above board.
"I’m old enough to remember when Democrats actually wanted to find out what happened in the 2016 election," White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said. "The Democrats clearly don’t want the truth to come out anymore as it might hurt them politically, but this call relates to a DOJ inquiry publicly announced months ago to uncover exactly what happened. The DOJ simply requested the President provide introductions to facilitate that ongoing inquiry, and he did so, that’s all."
Kupec said, "Mr. Durham is gathering information from numerous sources, including a number of foreign countries. At Attorney General Barr’s request, the President has contacted other countries to ask them to introduce the Attorney General and Mr. Durham to appropriate officials."
In a statement, a spokesperson for the Australian government said it has "always been ready to assist and cooperate with efforts that help shed further light on the matters under investigation. The [prime minister] confirmed this readiness once again in a conversation with the President."
Trump still complains frequently that those involved in the investigation of his campaign should be charged with crimes, asserting the FBI search for possible election season collusion between Russia and Trump campaign officials was a witch hunt spurred by agents and bureaucrats opposed to Trump becoming president. That investigation ended earlier this year when special counsel Robert Mueller determined there was insufficient evidence to charge any Americans with conspiring with Russia and declined to reach a decision about whether the president had sought to obstruct justice.
David Laufman, a former Justice Department official who was involved in the early stages of the Russia probe, said it was "fairly unorthodox for the attorney general personally to be flying around the world as a point person to further evidence-gathering for a specific Justice Department investigation," and especially so in Barr’s case.
Barr’s direct involvement in the effort also helps explain part of the controversial July phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. A rough transcript of that call shows Trump said he wanted Ukrainian assistance to help find out "what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine," and possible involvement with the Democratic National Committee computer system that U.S. agencies have determined was hacked by Russian intelligence ahead of the 2016 election.
Some of the president’s supporters have suggested Ukraine had a more direct role in the 2016 investigation than currently known, an assertion denied by current and former officials who were involved in the original probe.
A spokesperson for the CIA declined to comment, citing the ongoing review.
A former senior U.S. intelligence official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the ongoing investigation denied that the CIA was involved in monitoring any members of the Trump campaign. Any such operations were conducted by the FBI and were lawful, the former official said, emphasizing that the CIA focused on Russia’s interference in the election, and the role that Russian officials and intelligence agencies played.

The DOJ simply requested the President provide introductions to facilitate that ongoing inquiry, and he did so, that’s all."
Kupec said, "Mr. Durham is gathering information from numerous sources, including a number of foreign countries. At Attorney General Barr’s request, the President has contacted other countries to ask them to introduce the Attorney General and Mr. Durham to appropriate officials."
In a statement, a spokesperson for the Australian government said it has "always been ready to assist and cooperate with efforts that help shed further light on the matters under investigation. The [prime minister] confirmed this readiness once again in a conversation with the President."
Trump still complains frequently that those involved in the investigation of his campaign should be charged with crimes, asserting the FBI search for possible election season collusion between Russia and Trump campaign officials was a witch hunt spurred by agents and bureaucrats opposed to Trump becoming president. That investigation ended earlier this year when special counsel Robert Mueller determined there was insufficient evidence to charge any Americans with conspiring with Russia and declined to reach a decision about whether the president had sought to obstruct justice.
David Laufman, a former Justice Department official who was involved in the early stages of the Russia probe, said it was "fairly unorthodox for the attorney general personally to be flying around the world as a point person to further evidence-gathering for a specific Justice Department investigation," and especially so in Barr’s case.
Barr’s direct involvement in the effort also helps explain part of the controversial July phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. A rough transcript of that call shows Trump said he wanted Ukrainian assistance to help find out "what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine," and possible involvement with the Democratic National Committee computer system that U.S. agencies have determined was hacked by Russian intelligence ahead of the 2016 election.
Some of the president’s supporters have suggested Ukraine had a more direct role in the 2016 investigation than currently known, an assertion denied by current and former officials who were involved in the original probe.
A spokesperson for the CIA declined to comment, citing the ongoing review.
A former senior U.S. intelligence official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the ongoing investigation denied that the CIA was involved in monitoring any members of the Trump campaign. Any such operations were conducted by the FBI and were lawful, the former official said, emphasizing that the CIA focused on Russia’s interference in the election, and the role that Russian officials and intelligence agencies played.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Attorney General William Barr has held private meetings overseas with foreign intelligence officials seeking their help in a Justice Department inquiry that President Donald Trump hopes will discredit U.S. intelligence agencies’ examination of possible connections between Russia and members of the Trump campaign during the 2016 election.
And Trump has assisted with Barr’s efforts by calling other countries’ leaders, including the Australian prime minister in a recent phone call.
Justice Department and White House spokesmen, as well as an Australian government spokesman, confirmed and defended the efforts after The Washington Post and The New York Times reported them, citing people familiar with the matter.
Barr’s personal involvement is likely to stoke further criticism from Democrats pursuing impeachment that he is helping the Trump administration use executive branch powers to augment investigations aimed primarily at the president’s adversaries.
But the high-level Justice Department focus on intelligence operatives’ conduct matches Trump’s and conservatives’ "investigate the investigators" rallying cry. Barr has voiced his own concerns, telling lawmakers in April that he believed "spying did occur" when it came to the U.S. investigation of the Trump campaign.
The direct involvement of the nation’s top law enforcement official shows the priority Barr places on the investigation being conducted by John Durham, the U.S. attorney in Connecticut, who has been assigned the sensitive task of reviewing U.S. intelligence work surrounding the 2016 election and its aftermath.
Current and former intelligence and law enforcement officials expressed frustration and alarm Monday that the head of the Justice Department was taking such a direct role in re-examining what they view as conspiracy theories and baseless allegations of misconduct in the three-year-old election.
Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec did not name the countries in her statement. But Barr has already made overtures to British intelligence officials, and last week the attorney general traveled to Italy, where he and Durham met senior Italian government officials and Barr asked the Italians to assist Durham, according to one person familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive issue.
It was not Barr’s first trip to Italy to meet intelligence officials, the person said. The Trump administration has made similar requests of Australia, said people who discussed the interactions on the condition of anonymity.
In a recent phone call, Trump urged Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison to provide assistance to the ongoing Justice Department inquiry, the people said. Trump made the request at Barr’s urging, they said. The Trump phone call was first reported by The New York Times and later confirmed by an Australian government spokesman who said his government was ready to "help shed further light on the matters under investigation," Bloomberg reported.
Trump administration officials defended the moves as above board.
"I’m old enough to remember when Democrats actually wanted to find out what happened in the 2016 election," White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said. "The Democrats clearly don’t want the truth to come out anymore as it might hurt them politically, but this call relates to a DOJ inquiry publicly announced months ago to uncover exactly what happened. The DOJ simply requested the President provide introductions to facilitate that ongoing inquiry, and he did so, that’s all."
Kupec said, "Mr. Durham is gathering information from numerous sources, including a number of foreign countries. At Attorney General Barr’s request, the President has contacted other countries to ask them to introduce the Attorney General and Mr. Durham to appropriate officials."
In a statement, a spokesperson for the Australian government said it has "always been ready to assist and cooperate with efforts that help shed further light on the matters under investigation. The [prime minister] confirmed this readiness once again in a conversation with the President."
